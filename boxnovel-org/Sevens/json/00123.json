They were discussing which parties to offer the opportunity to clear it.</p><br/><p>Black haired bob-cut Tanya reset her glasses as she confirmed the contents.</p><br/><p>(At worst, up to ten floors in scale. It has been confirmed there is a boss monster per floor. After making their way to the third floor, the reconnaissance party safely returned.)</p><br/><p>The difficulty of clearing it definitely wasn\u2019t high. It could even be regarded as an easy one.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why they had to take care in their party selection. If they just sent a large number to clear it, then if a casualty surfaced, the numbers of adventurers in service to the guild would decrease.</p><br/><p>Even if adventurers gathered in Beim by the day, sending a squad out to be annihilated would only cause the Labyrinth to grow.</p><br/><p>The one heading the meeting was a normal resident supervisor who wasn\u2019t a sweeper or anything.</p><br/><p>Hair parted in a three to seven ration, a small mustache, and a slim build. The male staff member looked over the documents only he had in hand, and confirmed it with the rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anyone here have a party they\u2019d recommend? Even if you throw the names out, there\u2019s a possibility they\u2019ll decline, so having a bit more is fine. We\u2019re going for a number where it won\u2019t be too much trouble if everyone called for can go. And make sure you only recommend parties you think can handle it. No parties out on requests of which you don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female receptionist sitting next to Tanya, \u3010Marianne\u3011 was the girl who manned the counter directly opposite to her.</p><br/><p>Not a sweeper, she had straight blond hair, and emerald drooping eyes. Her atmosphere was one that made one think of her as an elder sister, and she often carried about a somewhat fluffy, and laid-back impression.</p><br/><p>She let out a sigh, and grumbled over how there was no point in her attending the meeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI fundamentally only deal with newbies here.\u201d</p><br/><p>On those words, Tanya laughed to herself a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese meetings are an obligation. And perhaps the day will come when one of your charges is to challenge a Labyrinth, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Marianne shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many years are you talking about here? By that time, my place will have been taken up by a younger and prettier girl. There are a few it\u2019d pay to bet on, but right now, they\u2019re all oblivious young\u2019uns. When you stir them up to do work like that, you\u2019re aware that not even half of them succeed, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The parties Marianne tended to were made up of new adventurers who had come to Beim without any appropriate knowledge, or parties with a lack of competence.</p><br/><p>For parties such as those, the guild kept plenty of receptionists like her to lead them on the path to become proficient adventurers.</p><br/><p>Tanya looked at the blackboard in the meeting room as she nodded. It was covered by the names of the various parties being recommended.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to think of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Around her, the other receptionists were putting out the names of the parties they favored. There were plenty of receptionists at the guild and those receptionists had plenty of adventurers they got along well with.</p><br/><p>It was a form of connection making to take care of the stream of requests flooding into the city.</p><br/><p>Tanya thought a bit, and raised her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s rare to get a recommendation from you, Tanya. So who is it you want to nominate?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t strange for the supervisor to be so surprised. Of all else, this was the first time Tanya had ever recommended a party for a labyrinth.</p><br/><p>For both the east guild branch, and the adventurers of it, Labyrinth clearing was a huge merit. It gave a chance for those adventurers to gain the treasures at the depths of the maze.</p><br/><p>For that sake, there were plenty of adventurers who tried to curry favor with their receptionists. But while Tanya was a receptionist on the surface, she was a sweeper below.</p><br/><p>She would occasionally dispose of the criminals among the adventurers, though she did desk work most of the time. But that was also so she could get a good look of the faces of the resident adventurers.</p><br/><p>That being the case, she really didn\u2019t have any interest in recommendations.</p><br/><p>However, this time\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to put forth the party headed by Lyle. Their serial number is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The supervisor looked through the documents in his hand for the records pertaining to Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that party, I see. They really are an interesting bunch. They look to be able to deal with most things, and their general formation is an all-purpose one to take on any sort of request\u2026 but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little too fast?\u201d</p><br/><p>As a party that had only been in Beim little over a month, they had received high evaluations on their request. But the problem was that they had barely just arrived.</p><br/><p>From the eyes of another, it would seem they were receiving preferential treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that have enough ability for it. And\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the supervisor showed his interest, Tanya smiled a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile they truly are quite an interesting party, they\u2019re quite proficient, so I think it best we keep them with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The supervisor looked at the papers as he stroked his chin. He nodded a number of times\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Having completed a request, I dropped by Beim\u2019s eastern-most guild branch\u2026 the east branch.</p><br/><p>I had taken a bath, so my blue hair was damp. It had grown quite a bit, so I was thinking of cutting it sometime in the near future.</p><br/><p>When I entered the guild lobby, I found the same wide space just as crowded as always.</p><br/><p>With her pals verdure hair, Miranda was wearing a heavy coat over her clothing. It was cold after all.</p><br/><p>I was the same, but I wore a robe instead.</p><br/><p>Under it was my casual clothing, with a sabre and knife hung at my waist.</p><br/><p>I looked around for a line that didn\u2019t look like it would take too long.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as crowded as ever. Maybe we should have come tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda had just returned, taken a bath and had a light meal, so she looked a little sleepy.</p><br/><p>This time\u2019s request was to carry out multiple jobs at a village near Beim. Monster hunting, as well as assisting in repairing the village, and some other odd jobs.</p><br/><p>Normally, they\u2019d have to send multiple parties for that one, but as ours was one that could accomplish most jobs with our few numbers, we negotiated a bit and took it up.</p><br/><p>In exchange, it we made it so we wouldn\u2019t be obligated to take up requests for a while.</p><br/><p>So with a free month ahead of us, I was thinking of challenging Beim\u2019s own personal Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to get this over with quickly. We\u2019re going to be off tomorrow, so wouldn\u2019t it feel better to rest from morning to night?\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the envelope with the paperwork in hand, and lined up. Miranda followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen go shopping with me tomorrow. Isn\u2019t it fine? You went and bought a pendant for Shannon, yet nothing for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ha ha ha. I laughed, as I panicked some in my head.</p><br/><p>(Crap! Did I not get anything for Miranda yet\u2026 but I get the feeling I went whopping with her a bit before the request\u2026? No, that was Aria!)</p><br/><p>To make sure she didn\u2019t make out my panic, I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was just a cheap one, though. Did you want a pendant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s from you, Lyle, then anything is fine. If you want to keep it cheap as possible, I\u2019ll even let you off with a kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the kiss she blew my way, I told her I\u2019d find her something nice, as I clenched the blue Jewel hanging from my neck.</p><br/><p>First came the Third in the same removed tone as always.</p><br/><p>\u300eYo, why\u2019d you forget Miranda-chan? When she\u2019s the one you need to be most cautious with\u2026 By the way, I think the kiss\u2019s the gift she\u2019ll be most happy with.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth spoke irritantly ay me.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s why I told you to keep a journal! Listen here, you\u2019ve got eight of them! There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll remember everything going on! Diligently record everything, and take action by a plan!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth goaded him as he\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eYet you were so troubled by a single Mama. And wait, Lyle\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what to think of you taking action just because you were told to. If you keep the minimum level of interaction, then you can avoid getting to deep into it. Watch yourself.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth, with Miranda being his favorite.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I\u2019m sure I said something similar. You really are no good in that field.\u300f</p><br/><p>My doting grandfather\u2026 the Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey how about you guys give some actual advice? Lyle, giving a cold refusal here is an option, you know. Listen here, I\u2019ve never had myself stuck under Zenoire\u2019s thumb, I tell you. At times like these\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>I listened to his opinion, while I\u2026</p><br/><p>(No, grandmother had you rolling about quite nicely on the palm of her hand. Come to think of it, she was quite amazing\u2026)</p><br/><p>While I felt like I was going to break into a cold sweat, there were other adventurers around.</p><br/><p>And in such a situation, if we put out such a sweet air\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKeh! Well look at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who took such a blatantly displeased attitude was \u3010Erhart Baumann\u3011, in a different line.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a tank top above, but this time he draped a coat-like thing over it. He had a large sword over his back, and his comrades were around him.</p><br/><p>He was glaring my way.</p><br/><p>(Does this really look like something to be jealous of?)</p><br/><p>I gave a vague smile to try and play it off, but our relation was one where he had picked a fight with me the day I got here. It doesn\u2019t seem he thinks of me a rival, but he held a strong opposition, and a belligerent personality.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNext, Erhart-kun~. Ah, you\u2019re glaring again! That\u2019s no good!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the adventurers in front of him finished up their business and headed off somewhere, Erhart walked up to the blond, large-chested receptionist with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-of course not, Marianne-san. He was just being noisy. I\u2019ll be there right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>With his head in the clouds, he reported the day\u2019s results to the receptionist known as Marianne.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe divided labor, and finished up the cleaning of the gutters. Here are the documents!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, good work\u2026 this is amazing! You\u2019ve only ever gotten \u300eD\u300fs up to now, but you\u2019ve finally been awarded a \u300eC\u300f. You\u2019ve worked your hardest, haven\u2019t you? I\u2019m overjoyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhe, ehehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at a delighted Erhart\u2019s party, the adventurers around quietly whispered amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet. The beauty\u2019s a newbie exclusive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo they don\u2019t know a thing\u2026 \u2018tis a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tilted my head at whether they were pitiful or not. It\u2019s just, the individuals themselves seemed extremely happy, and they were heading down a respectable adventurer\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 To those guys, perhaps this way is best.)</p><br/><p>As I watched over their exchange, Erhart turned to me with a triumphant expression on his face. It appears he was bragging over the fact his personal receptionist was a beauty.</p><br/><p>My face was lightly grasped</p><br/><p>Miranda smiled as she\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps you shouldn\u2019t look that way. You\u2019ll make me jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>I remover her hands, and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019re joking. You were having quite a bit of fun watching that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew Miranda\u2019s personality. If she really was jealous, she would use all means at her disposal to eliminate the source.</p><br/><p>Of course, before it came to that, she\u2019d take various measure to make sure it didn\u2019t happen to begin with.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s fun to watch, but don\u2019t stare at her so intently. Just take some discreet glances and I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda had also noticed how Erhart\u2019s party was being used quite nicely, it seems. I stopped looking over so openly.</p><br/><p>The line moved, and we waited out turn.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s receptionist was one I was seeing for the first time today, of whose name I was not aware.</p><br/><p>Miranda and I sat, and the receptionist accepted the envelope along with our guild cards.</p><br/><p>She courteously opened the documents, and confirmed their contents. While her expression didn\u2019t change, she nodded as she praised our work.</p><br/><p>\u201cA \u300eB\u300f for every task performed. Splendid work. There was a wide variety of tasks to this one, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem. We\u2019ll be placing our expectations on you as we have.\u201d</p><br/><p>She promptly processed it, before returning the papers and our guild cards. She stood to go pick up our reward.</p><br/><p>After she had distanced herself a bit, Miranda spoke in a bit of a let-down tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuge difference from Arumsaas. I heard they received a proper education, but I never thought it\u2019d be to this level. I had a rougher image of them in my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what was she expecting?</p><br/><p>The receptionist brought the reward soon enough, and confirmed the monetary sum with me. But at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-san, was it? You\u2019ve completed a number of requests, so please stop by with the rest of your adventurer comrades within the month. You\u2019ve got to complete the paperwork to renew your guild cards as well, so can I ask you to show your faces at some regular interval?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her polite treatment made me remember Hawkins-san, who dealt with me when I first became an adventurer in Dalien.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then in the near future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you. Would you like to renew your guild card?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda took out her card, the receptionist accepted it, and immediately went into the renewal process.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems she suddenly remembered something, as she turned to me with somewhat of a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Giving a light apology as she returned Miranda\u2019s card\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-san, your party has received a request for Labyrinth Subjugation. If you do plan to go, it would be a big help if you finished everyone\u2019s renewals before you head off.\u201d</p><br/><p>My face met Miranda\u2019s, and we both turned back to look at the receptionist\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cLabyrinth Subjugation, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her expression turned a little troubled, but she explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. A Labyrinth has been discovered, and a request sent out to clear it, so\u2026 huh? Have you yet to confirm it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The information on current Labyrinths was posted on a bulletin in the loby. That I knew. But we hadn\u2019t been in Beim long enough for that.</p><br/><p>When I explained that fact to her, she\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstandable. But the request has only just been issued, so you have the ability to decline. The planned departure date is in a week\u2019s time after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>I to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to speak with my comrades, so we\u2019ll decide whether to take it up or not by tomorrow. Is it alright if we give the report then?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I don\u2019t mind. It is best you finish it quickly. Within two days would be ideal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The paperwork ended, and having accepted the reward, me and Miranda stood from our seats, and walked through the lobby to exit the guild.</p><br/><p>Miranda.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was faster than I thought it\u2019d be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I also get the feeling it may have been too fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had thought we wouldn\u2019t get one for our first three months at least.</p><br/><p>But surprisingly enough, the Labyrinth Subjugation Request had been sent out.</p><br/><p>From within the Jewel, the Sixth\u2019s doubtful voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s going too smoothly. If only nothing happens\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>He seemed to be thinking there was a trap waiting for us, but I can\u2019t think of a reason for the guild to do such a thing. Even if we weren\u2019t giving our all, it should stil be true we were proficient adventurers to them.</p><br/><p>(Is something going on?)</p><br/><p>While I was lost in thought, Miranda looked over at the bulletin on the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there really is a Labyrinth Subjugation request. Our number\u2019s on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The numbers assigned to adventurers and parties were listed under the notice.</p><br/><p>Those numbers were carved into our guild cards, and I confirmed the digits again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Something felt off, but it was also a happy miscalculation for us to be able to challenge a Labyrinth so soon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

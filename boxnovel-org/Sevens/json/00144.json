It just looked like that back there, and we were usually more domineering! I assure you. And even as we are, we\u2019re feudal lords! There\u2019s absolutely no way we\u2019d lose to our wives! (Though I never said we would win)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About Alette-san.</p><br/><p>A: Fourth Generation Head ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cBorn to a knight house, she\u2019s a fourth daughter in her late twenties. For commoners, perhaps twenty five would be passable?</p><br/><p>But for nobles, surpassing twenty affords defective-goods treatment in this world. She\u2019s capable, and due to her efforts, she was awarded a promotion to train up the new generation, causing the unmarried knight to be sent away from her homeland\u2026 it seems she\u2019s been so busy she let her years slip by.</p><br/><p>By the way, with Alette-san\u2019s subordinates being knights as well\u2026 naturally enough, they already have significant others! A maiden leading a squadron of men with wives and fianc\u00e9es, yet the captain is single\u2026</p><br/><p>Just what could the country be doing? Personally, I\u2019d (forcefully) organize her a marriage interview, and marry her off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Is it alright to touch the bats in the Labyrinth with your bare hands?</p><br/><p>A: Third Generation Head \u30fd( \u30fb\u2200\u30fb)\u30ce: \u201cClara on material recovery wears gloves. Well, they\u2019re monsters, so you don\u2019t have to sweat the small details, right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About why they didn\u2019t immediately sell the gemstones from the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cWell, carry them around, and you can liquidate them whenever you want, really. If the monetary sum will be the same, then wouldn\u2019t it be better to just carry them around? There are some readers who believe he avoided it because people would discern the Skills he had, but it\u2019s not a Skill that Lyle alone possesses, you know. There aren\u2019t that many who have it, mind you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About the Numerology.</p><br/><p>A: Seventh Generation Head (\uff1b \u30fb`\u0434\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cIt\u2019s a secret that the author was shocked when he looked back at that after drafting up the ancestors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: How did they determine the number of floors in the Labyrinth?</p><br/><p>A: Third Generation Head \u30fd(\u30fb\u2200\u30fb )\u30ce: \u201cThe guild secures adventurers with such Skills for their survey parties. Beim doesn\u2019t have a feudal lord, so they have to find and crush Labyrinths of their own accord. I\u2019m sure they make teams of such people for the task.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I don\u2019t get why Miranda\u2019s party were so opposed.</p><br/><p>A: Fourth Generation Head ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cOne of the reasons they chose to follow Lyle was because they liked the boy. It\u2019s thinkable that someone like Novem with hidden relations to Celes could betray him, right? They couldn\u2019t just swallow her pleas of only working for Lyle\u2019s sake, and when they investigated her, she did show suspicious behavior, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About the construction of Lyle\u2019s Jewel ornaments, and Novem\u2019s staff.</p><br/><p>A: Lyle (\uff1b\u00b4\u2200\uff40): \u201cI think they\u2019re made of the same metal. Thought I\u2019m more curious about how, after a Count House went through such troubles to obtain it, the Forxuz House got some as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Why is it that you can continue to write a story as shitty as this?</p><br/><p>A: Hey, I\u2019m surprised myself. While I\u2019m writing, I sometimes get these flashes of shitty inspiration and\u2026 it wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this at the start. Well, I\u2019m having fun writing it (lol).</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: mr. lyle should\u2019ve met ms. alette.</p><br/><p>A: Seventh Generation Head ( \u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40): \u201cDon\u2019t be foolish. Having such a meeting in such a place would be\u2026 too good to be tru\u2014ahem! It would be a mess, would it not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: When mr. lyle made his appearance, who was it the women were pointing their weapons at?</p><br/><p>A: Monica Dramatic(\u309c\u2200\u309c)Entrance!: \u201cSplit between Novem and Miranda, they were holding weapons at, and glaring at one another. There, the chicken dickwad jumped into the fray. Normally, he\u2019d come into to stop as well, but he immediately went into seducing the lot of them! He\u2019s truly the goddamn useless chicken dickwad I first opened my eyes to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Are all monsters women?</p><br/><p>A: Monica \u30fd(\u00b4\u30fc\uff40)\u30ce: \u201cWrong. Zero to nine are women. Oh, a hint\u2026 or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Why did the ancestors run away when the female army entered the Jewel?</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head (\uff1b\u309c\u0414\u309c): \u201c\u2026 I-I didn\u2019t run. It was a strategic retreat. They had plenty to mull their heads over as it is, so meeting us would result in true chaos. I\u2019d appreciate you don\u2019t assume we ran, okay. It\u2019s just, the atmosphere wasn\u2019t right, okay? We were just reading the mood, and handing off the right of way. Right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: The reason the scene of kissing all the heroines was cut, please.</p><br/><p>A: mr. lyle ( \uff40\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4): \u201c\u2026 It was a fabulous scene, but the wall of word count was the problem. Because that alone would have accounted a whole chapter. What, it shall go on. There are as many chances as there are stars in the sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: How would the ancestors\u2019 wives have dealt with it?</p><br/><p>A: Wives ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cWhat noisy children. Lyle, just push them down already.\u201d</p><br/><p>mr. lyle (\uff40\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cMy dear young flowers, now is not such a mood! I, Lyle, am unable to treat a woman in such a manner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wives (*\u30ce\u2200\u30ce): \u201cKyaaah! Our descendent! He sure is different from our husbands! It must be because of my blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>*Swoon*</p><br/><p>mr. lyle (\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40 ): \u201c(Hmm, after a deep kiss, you\u2019re saying that now? \u2026 time constraints are all that prevent me from going any further. Even my ancestors are easy game.) It\u2019s because of everything you\u2019ve taught me, my beautiful flowers.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

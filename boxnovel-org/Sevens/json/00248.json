The port was, at the very least able to moor three ships, so ships were moving back and forth.</p><br/><p>The craftsmen brought in by the merchants and other relevant parties instantly increased the town\u2019s population.</p><br/><p>In that energetic South Beim, with Monica and Clara\u2026 the three of us looked at Porter in the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Having been worn through by constant use, Porter had been serviced by Monica for the long journey ahead, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPorter\u2026 you\u2019ve grown up splendidly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Touching both hands to my mouth, I looked at Porter.</p><br/><p>On its cylinder of a head, two large, round eyes. That part hadn\u2019t changed. But its body had undergone heavy modifications. It was almost a lump of iron\u2026 there stood Porter\u2019s gallant figure.</p><br/><p>From the Jewel\u2026 the ancestors\u2019 hearts were also moved.</p><br/><p>\u300ePorter is our comrade. Looks like he\u2019s become somewhat splendid while we weren\u2019t looking.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2026 seem to be feeling attachment towards this mass of iron and clockwork.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThis density, this dignity. While being even more refined than before, that astoundingly charming body, the perfect assimilation of pointlessness and male romance\u2026 Porter, you\u2019re the best.\u300f</p><br/><p>It was just as the Seventh said. This Porter\u2026 had become one size larger. Monica had looked at Damien\u2019s large-scale Porter, and took it as a challenge I\u2019m sure.</p><br/><p>Its greatest showpiece was the pair of arms folded on top.</p><br/><p>The parts it used were externally reinforced much like the armor of the armored giant monster we once defeated in Arumsaas, and carefully manufactured.</p><br/><p>Monica spoke, brimming with pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be troubling if that was enough to amaze you. This Monica\u2026 is fundamentally greater than those three units at Professor Damien\u2019s place. Fundamentally! Porter, show everyone your true form! \u2026Clara-san, as we discussed, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica assumed a pose, but when Clara didn\u2019t show any reaction, she took a few glances, and sent a request.</p><br/><p>Clara quietly nodded, and held up her staff.</p><br/><p>Slowly coming alive, Porter\u2019s front portion lifted up, and became a torso.</p><br/><p>The arms on its back were deployed, and its leg portion was supported up by an increased eight tires with a reinforced frame.</p><br/><p>\u201cWOOOAAAHH!!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I showed my excitement, Monica excitedly looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it! Monica is different from those scrap metals around the place! My base specs are different than those garbage that would rejoice at some version upgrade, or a small modification! Now bear witness, my chicken dickwaaad!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding both hands towards the ceiling, her yell sounded as if it came straight from her soul.</p><br/><p>Inside the Jewel, the ancestors as well\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eAmazing. You\u2019re amazing, Porter!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou did your best\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat a form. This boorish form\u2026 it\u2019s perfect, is it not!\u300f</p><br/><p>But there was a single one to give a cold opinion. It was Milleia-san. Having joined along the way, Milleia-san didn\u2019t have any affection for Porter. Let alone that, she was a person who said his head was unnecessary. And she offered her fifty copper.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Are these functions really necessary? They aren\u2019t, right? Rather, this\u2026 how much space is taken to stow those unnecessary parts? I don\u2019t know what to think about adding on strange features and doing nothing to make your trip more comfortable.\u300f</p><br/><p>I wanted to tell her how she just didn\u2019t get it, but it\u2019s true it was an important point.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Monica, I understand that Porter has been reborn. So how are its specs compared to before? As in usable space, and comfort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica stuck out her index finger, and bent it left and right.</p><br/><p>\u201cChicken dickwad, you\u2019d do best not to underestimate me. I\u2019ve sacrificed a bit of space, but I put the craftsmen to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>To her, Clara quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou overworked them, is what you mean. If Monica-san ever approaches them with a smile, the dwarves and gnomes will now run away at full force.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Monica.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shrugged her shoulders, and shook her head tiredly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re craftsmen. They shine best when they\u2019re desperately trying to surmount an impossible order. On the contrary, I\u2019d like you to praise me. Because this Monica has passed down various lost crafts. For the sake of South Beim\u2019s future, no\u2026 for the sake of my chicken!\u201d</p><br/><p>I circled around to Porter\u2019s back, and opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotten a little narrower? Well, there are sofas, or rather benches attached on both sides, so perhaps that\u2019s why it looks that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mass of metal porter\u2026 when transporting goods or people, that reliable and central member of our party had been reborn.</p><br/><p>As I returned to Monica\u2019s side, Clara reverted Porter to its original form.</p><br/><p>She tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weight has gone up considerably. Yet even so, I get the feeling the Mana expenditure to drive it has lowered. And whenever I move it, something feels off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica walked up to Porter, opened up its front portion, and showed it off.</p><br/><p>In it, the three stones of the Peridot we\u2019d found in the Labyrinth had been embedded. There were strange mechanisms furnished around them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my gemstones\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right! This is Porter\u2019s energy source! By it, Porter will surely move more powerfully than before! It\u2019s truly Porter\u2019s heart! With only three gemstones, we\u2019ve achieved a suitable means of operation!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Monica took some glances at me, I\u2019d like to believe she did feel at least a bit of guilt at taking them.</p><br/><p>And I put a hand to Porter, and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cPorter, good for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara, in regards to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Lyle-san\u2019s fine with that, then so be it. More so, you\u2019re just going to ignore how she arbitrarily used the gemstones? You neglected to report that to the party, Monica-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Clara\u2019s words, Monica flipped each of her twin tails.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was the chicken dickwad\u2019s personal possession. And I am the chicken dickwad\u2019s personal possession. Ergo, everything of the chicken dickwad\u2019s belongs to me. And all of me belongs to the chicken dickwad! So there\u2019s no problem to speak of!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she checked to see if I was mad, she had given quite an outrageous statement, so I chopped her head form behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s no good. Say you\u2019re going to use them beforehand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAuu\u2026 but everyone was so busy these days, and whenever you got back, you\u2019d all collapse asleep, so I was trying to be tactful in my own way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, we were busy.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just South Beim, we had a necessity to act for what was to come. Porter\u2019s modifications were a part of that.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Eva was negotiating with the tribe of elves that had dropped by South Beim.</p><br/><p>They were on the main street, where a stage had been prepared for the minstrels and traveling performers.</p><br/><p>In that space with heavy pedestrian traffic, Eva made a certain request to the troupe\u2026 to the tribe.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 And this is the song and story I\u2019d like you to spread. It can just be in rumors, so can\u2019t you circulate it? The collateral is your lodging fee in South Beim. We\u2019ll make it dirt cheap.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a travelling troupe, cheap lodging was an appreciated gesture. Hearing that, the young-man-like head elf touched a hand to his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a request from a daughter of the Nihil. We\u2019ll listen to it. By the way, there are a number of things I\u2019d like to ask about. Fort Redant, or perhaps Fortress, I\u2019d like to know the particular details of it. The story of the Hero who fought back an army of monsters is in fashion these days. We just flowed into Beim ourselves, so we\u2019ve no clue of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eva, upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you come from? Not Zayin or Lorphys, right? Galleria? Rusworth? Doesn\u2019t look it. I doubt it\u2019s Cartaffs, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The head elf let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cBahnseim. We ran away from there. It\u2019s in a terrible state right not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eva nodded at the head, and inquired with a serious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBahnseim, huh. If you\u2019ll exchange it for info on Bahnseim, then I\u2019ll oblige. I was there before, but has it really gotten that bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>The head looked at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWar, or rather trampling down. It was the first time I ever witnessed an army that didn\u2019t fear death. The authority grasped by the future queen of Bahnseim, it reeks of abnormality. It could be the case she\u2019ll leave her name in history. In a bad sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eva knew of Celes\u2019 abnormality. If you hadn\u2019t seen it up close\u2026 if passed by lip, it was only the cruel queen-to-be of Bahnseim, end of story.</p><br/><p>That was how Beim was. Even when info on Celes came in, it was a common tale. Or perhaps an atrocious woman\u2026 is how they summed it up.</p><br/><p>Some part of the city was convinced it was fire on the opposite shore. Eva listened to the head\u2019s words of Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got the feeling ruin was coming closer by the day. The men were rounded up for war, and not villages alone, even the larger towns were only women and children. Seeing an old one was a rare sight. Refugees turned bandit are increasing. We were attacked a number of times on the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abandon food supplies and run, or fight amongst each other to keep it. Hearing that story, Eva was sure it was truly a terrible situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t there any nobles rebelling against the throne? Feudal lords are fine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>On her question, the head shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are none. To rephrase, there were. Past tense. Many feudal lords have been crushed. Centralle\u2019s army was one thing, but the Walt House was also involved. It just goes to show their title of Bahnseim\u2019s strongest wasn\u2019t for show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s home, the Walt House, was cooperating in crushing the country\u2019s opposing powers. At that, Eva felt a hint of irony\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 May was counting the increasing food stands in South Beim.</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh! There are three more today! Is that one sweets? The next smells of meat. Hah\u2026 three whole new comrades on my food walking course.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked over the stands with an expression of bliss, as she happily thought over what she would eat today.</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday was deep fried, so meat for today\u2026 no, it\u2019s hard to dismiss fresh sweets. But I don\u2019t have the war funds to eat all of them\u2026 what a tragedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>May generally only ever used her money on food, and she had received some from Novem so she could walk the stands and eat.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have the intent to go as far as to manage her own money, and she was sure she was fine that way. Because of that, she received payment as a daily allowance from Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, it all starts with some juice to wet the throat. Let\u2019s go with some refreshing citrus, why not.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, the small-built May stopped her feet\u2019s course to the stand, and turned around.</p><br/><p>With long, unkempt black hair, and a coat that wasn\u2019t yet a match for the season, a woman of high stature stood.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 If you\u2019re going to rampage here, then stop. This happens to be one of my favorites.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her opponent was Marina.</p><br/><p>Marina tossed the paper bag in her hands towards May. Taking it, May found the bag was warm, and her eyes sparkled as she unearthed the skewer meat within.</p><br/><p>Enduring the drool creeping its way to the surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what are you planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>She took some fleeting glances between Marina and the bag as she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s been a while since I got to go that wild. It was fun, so I\u2019m thanking you. And I\u2019d like to meet your leader. He did quite a dirty thing. It\u2019s gotten hard for me to live in Beim.\u201d</p><br/><p>May observed Marina\u2019s state, and noticed that was a lie. She took a skewer from the bag, brought it to her mouth, and bit in.</p><br/><p>\u201cIntroduction fee, was it? Very well, I\u2019ll arrange it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for that. With failure, and a few other reasons tacked on, they ran off with all the money I\u2019d been saving up, so now I\u2019m broke.\u201d</p><br/><p>That one did not look like a lie.</p><br/><p>May bit further into the meat on the stick, and ate it heartily as she looked at Marina.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so? What\u2019s your real objective? For someone of your level, ma\u2019am, I\u2019m sure any Guild would accept you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marina laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve lived much longer than I, ma\u2019am? Girly, you\u2019ll get on well in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>With her own form, May knew Marina would feel uncomfortable if treated as a little girl. It was something she learned to blend in with the world of humans.</p><br/><p>But even so, looked on from around, it\u2019s true it looked uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>May quietly continued on into the meat. Marina muttered something like, \u2018fine, you win\u2019, and began speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care about only the East Branch escaping, and being isolated as a result. But you see\u2026 I have an interest in the leader one like you would serve. Is that boy also strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle had Marina\u2019s eyes set on him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>In Lyle\u2019s room of memories, the room he had once lived his life. The form of his youth\u2026 LYLE quietly sat.</p><br/><p>He crossed his legs on top of the bed, left his elbows against his lap, and placed his jaw on his hands.</p><br/><p>His form was a child, but he had a bit of presence to him.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 The Fifth will have stay a while. I want Lyle to know him. Though he may feel something after knowing him. But before that\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>LYLE looked up at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>\u300eEven if you don\u2019t want to see who you really are, you\u2019re abandoning me too much. I\u2019m going to develop abandonment issues. This form is your own. It\u2019s the form of your younger years, and yet\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s room in the Jewel had become a room filled with what he didn\u2019t want to see. The Jewel had interfered. Celes had interfered. And it was a room born as the result.</p><br/><p>And the young boy LYLE was the form of the current Lyle himself.</p><br/><p>LYLE was sealed away, and the Lyle that was born was just a small child\u2019s heart in a large body.</p><br/><p>He had matured under the watch of the ancestors, and had grown mentally stable, but there was an insecure existence to him.</p><br/><p>If LYLE\u2019s memory returned, that balance would crumble. Then who am I? It was clear he would come to be haunted by such worries.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, just face me. I know you\u2019re scared of the potential you lost. But even so\u2026 you can only erase me and move on.\u300f</p><br/><p>In an expression unthinkable from a child, LYLE muttered sorrowfully\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

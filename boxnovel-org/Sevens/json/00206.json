Diagonally to my side was Novem, and she used her magic to make a light from her staff.</p><br/><p>Both the ceiling and floor were of rugged rock. The walls grew moss, and were perpetually damp. Among Labyrinth passageways, it was of the wider sort, and there was at least eight meters to the ceiling. Its width around twenty. In the midst of battle, I doubt there would be a need to worry about a lack of space.</p><br/><p>Around, in blue, or perhaps navy suits of armor, the three Valkyrie units guarded the two of them. But there wasn\u2019t really a need for that.</p><br/><p>Two weeks distance from Beim.</p><br/><p>At present, I\u2026 Lyle Walt had been dispatched to subjugate a Labyrinth that had manifested.</p><br/><p>That giant monster legion already felt like a thing of the distant past.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Clara, stay on standby. I\u2019ll have Miranda return to the surface. Aria, proceed onwards, and remove the monsters ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave orders as I walked, but me and the girls\u2026 my party members had quite some distance between us.</p><br/><p>Conversing through Skill\u2026 Connection\u2026 I issued orders to Aria, Miranda and Clara, who led Valkyrie Series units of their own.</p><br/><p>I turned an eye to the Valkyrie walking opposite to Novem.</p><br/><p>(The mass produced unit Damien and old Letarta completed\u2026 not bad.)</p><br/><p>The ones they had successfully completed had been simplified, and while there were differences in their appearances and body types, there wasn\u2019t any difference in their specs. They were wearing visor-like face masks, and I couldn\u2019t tell what expressions they were making, but the Valkyrie Series were generally expressionless.</p><br/><p>The wing-like binders on their backs could process magic stones into a liquid, which they could then use as fuel. It considerably reduced my Mana cost, so it was a huge help.</p><br/><p>Black hair was the standard. However, each had devoted its time to differentiating itself with hair style. Bob cut, long waves. Braids. It seems the mass produced models had personality and a sense of individuality as well.</p><br/><p>While walking through the uneven corridor, I was organizing the information flowing into my head.</p><br/><p>This Labyrinth that had manifested out of a cave had only three floors to speak of. But the annoying part was the expanse it covered.</p><br/><p>It seems there was only a single boss at the bottom, and there was little deviation in its monsters. We weren\u2019t particularly having a hard time. Three separate Labyrinth Subjugation requests had descended on Beim, and there were few adventurer parties they could send around.</p><br/><p>Alette-san\u2019s party had challenged another Labyrinth, and it was decided they would dispatch mercenaries of the South Branch to the last one.</p><br/><p>The East Branch normally wouldn\u2019t let Labyrinth Subjugations fall to other branches. Because if they did, the East Branch\u2019s sole valuable appeal point would disappear. They wouldn\u2019t be able to gather adventurers.</p><br/><p>While I absentmindedly wandered the cave, I ran into Miranda on her way out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could hear your voice the whole way, but meeting is yet another sensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were four mass-produced Valkyries around her, and a sister carrying the luggage, her knees shaking as she shed her sweat.</p><br/><p>One of the Valkyries held a lantern in her hand to light up the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Miranda was wearing a hat, with a large rucksack over her back. She wasn\u2019t in her usual skirt, instead donning thick work clothes, and gloves.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like things went well on your side as well. Shannon, there won\u2019t be any monsters on the way back, so rest easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Shannon raised her face, but perhaps from fatigue, she didn\u2019t rain me with jeers as she usually did.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I want to take a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she complained, Miranda lowered a fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cShannon, could you quit it already? See, just a little more to the first floor. Once we\u2019re there, a short break, and we\u2019ll be outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Miranda tried to knock the life back into her, Shannon simply tottered as she walked off. And Miranda\u2019s party started down the road we had came from. I let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like Shannon\u2019s doing alright.</p><br/><p>The one to respond was Novem. She was laughing, and with the long gazes she took at the girl, I\u2019m sure she was happy at her growth.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have any stamina before. If we keep at it little by little, she\u2019ll build up some strength. Even so, this time\u2019s Labyrinth sure is vast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second floor.</p><br/><p>At the head, Aria and Miranda were eliminating monsters. Clara was keeping the roads clear on the first floor.</p><br/><p>And Eva or May would likely substitute out with Miranda when she got back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our second Labyrinth subjugation, and everyone\u2019s already a commander. Of course, we were the only ones dispatched in the first place. Good grief, just what part about this is small scale?\u201d</p><br/><p>As a Labyrinth, it was only three floors. Needlessly wide, with only one boss.</p><br/><p>With the scarce variety of monsters, there weren\u2019t any particularly strong ones. Certainly, in the guild\u2019s classification system, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for it to be written off as small scale.</p><br/><p>But I felt a little of a grudge.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s also a problem how the amount of stones we have to earn has been defined. I want to take the shortest route, beat the boss, and end it already.)</p><br/><p>That was from the Guild\u2019s side. Not the East Branch, headquarters had ordered us to acquire a set amount of Magic Stones.</p><br/><p>I asked Alette-san, and it seems there had rarely even been such orders given out. If you find some rare material, then get as much of it as you can, was the most they ever asked for, she said.</p><br/><p>The Third spoke to me amused.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019ve gotten their hate quite nicely, Lyle. Just a little more.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026 I knew that, but getting this persistent harassment was harsh.</p><br/><p>This venture through the vast passages was also to test out the mass produced Valkyries\u2019 specs.</p><br/><p>Old Letarta and Damien were on standby up top, and Adele-san and Maksim-san were participating as well.</p><br/><p>However, Monica was keeping house at the mansion.</p><br/><p>Novem smiled at me as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because they believe we can do that much. I\u2019m sure the Guild isn\u2019t stupid enough to offer an impossible task, and have another Labyrinth Rampage on their hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019d really hope that\u2019s so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last time, Fidel-san swung them around to his will, and got twelve cannons\u2019 worth of compensation, I heard. And it seems the Guild executives took it up to get the man\u2019s backing.</p><br/><p>In exchange for advocating in regards to their failed defensive war, they drank down his demands.</p><br/><p>(Well, the two extra cannons flowed from Vera to me, but\u2026)</p><br/><p>We were talking, but cutting it off on the way, I pulled a weapon from my hip. Novem had to illuminate the surroundings, so she couldn\u2019t take action. She stepped back, and strengthened the light.</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie Series took their weapons from their back wing binders. They were guns.</p><br/><p>They were items prepared by old Letarta, who modified them, apparently.</p><br/><p>The Valkyries\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEnemy confirmed. Proceeding to eliminate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBang.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the guns blew their flames, three monster responses in the passageway ahead went out. Even so, the survivors came out way.</p><br/><p>The Valkyries swiftly prepared for the next attack, while the third unit alone lowered her gun.</p><br/><p>The monsters on the other side of the dark passage collapsed without showing their forms.</p><br/><p>I put away a Katana, and scratched my head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Their performance is definitely high, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem gave a bitter smile as well. Coming to my side, she agreed with my assertion.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to a single monster of this Labyrinth, a bullet is more costly\u2026 we\u2019re going into the red.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had high specs, but I couldn\u2019t help but have problems on the financial front. This time was just an experiment, so Letarta had them carry just the guns, but money-wise, they were a weapon I didn\u2019t want to use so often.</p><br/><p>The Valkyries took out tools to strip off the Magic Stones and materials.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is time for robbery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will cleanly pick them off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDissection is my specialty. Someday, those money eating worms manufactured before us, and that piece of junk Monica shall be dissected by my hands as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third unit gave an ominous statement, but I ignored it. I could understand it was just standard communication from these ones.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take too much time. Once we get to the third floor, I\u2019ll have Eva or May deliver supplies down. Have we achieved the quota?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I checked in with Connection, a Valkyrie on the surface replied. She was carrying out Adele-san\u2019s support.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 According to Adele, we have currently fulfilled sixty percent of the required quota. But hearing of the bullet consumption, she started crying.\u300f</p><br/><p>On top of that, I heard the voice coming into the Valkyrie\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u300eAAAaaAAH! Our expenses! Why!? Why make them use such a thing!? We\u2019re down! Our profits from this Labyrinth Subjugation are going poooof!!\u300f</p><br/><p>Looks like she has it rough.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s put a usage restriction on the guns. Any more, and I\u2019ll feel bad for Adele-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, the Fourth let a tired voice from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, you understand this is also your problem, right? Properly make a profit, man. Experiments are important, but money problems are just as important.\u300f</p><br/><p>Advice quite suited of the Fourth Generation.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Information dealer Rauno\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>In it, the windows were shut and curtained, darkening the room. The only faint light emanated from the use of Rauno\u2019s assistant Innis\u2019 Skill\u2026 Information.</p><br/><p>From the information Innis had on hand, it was a Skill to predict the future.</p><br/><p>Rauno put both hands in his pockets, and looked over Innis.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo how is it, Innis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes were closed, and after a while, she opened her mouth. Rauno had her read through as much of the information he\u2019d gathered as possible.</p><br/><p>To hit the mark on her predictions, she couldn\u2019t help but need a large amount of info. But it wasn\u2019t like her accuracy was directly proportional to her information level. Because fake information would always slip around.</p><br/><p>But with more information, there were more things she could determine, and a bigger picture she could see based on that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Beim is still recovering from the damage that monster army caused.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the army of monsters was closing in, they had scattered money, and produced large numbers of weapons. But Lyle had defeated the majority at Fort Redant, so looking at actual damage from enemy numbers, it was something quite insignificant.</p><br/><p>Rather than physical damage, it was severe monetary, and resource loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work for them to recover so much in only a few months. But I guess that\u2019s Beim for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Rauno\u2019s light words, Innis didn\u2019t show a response. She continued on with her predictions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are strange movements in Cartaffs. It may escalate to a large-scale riot. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Guild headquarters, and among the merchants, dissatisfaction towards Lyle-san is rising. I conclude that pressure is being put down mainly by those not involved in backing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rauno gave a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy of course. Rile up the Tr\u0113s House\u2019 head, and even the South Branch, and of course you\u2019ll be hated. Though I doubt he doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The Tr\u0113s House is watching, and waiting. Even when the other merchants and Guild make their moves, they don\u2019t show any interest. The current Tr\u0113s House head is sure to have backed him. The probability of him being riled up on purpose is high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rauno couldn\u2019t understand that part. The face that Lyle had seduced one of the Tr\u0113s House daughters was something he had confirmed from rumor, and the individual himself.</p><br/><p>So he didn\u2019t know the reason behind angering the head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean he got the amount of money he needed already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The probability is low. There is a possibility he has made a large change in objectives along the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rauno watched over Lyle\u2019s actions with caution. It wasn\u2019t because he was a client.</p><br/><p>It was because Lyle could slip up Innis\u2019 predictions altogether.</p><br/><p>With the monster army as well, Innis had determined victory would be held down after heavy damage came out.</p><br/><p>But the result could be called an overwhelming triumph.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung as he is, he\u2019s leading the Guild and merchants by the nose\u2026 he won\u2019t live long, that one. After Beim kicks him out, where will he go? Become the groom of Zayin\u2019s Holy Maiden, or Lorphys\u2019 princess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Innis replied to his joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe individual has shown actions pointing to the desire to be exiled from Beim. And the probability of him becoming a groom alive is low.\u201d</p><br/><p>While knowing full well that Innis rarely hit straight when things came to Lyle, he couldn\u2019t help but look into him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, how will he move next, my client?\u201d</p><br/><p>Innis opened her eyes. Perhaps she had overused her Skill, as she looked as if she\u2019d collapse to the floor. Rushing over, and supporting up her body, Rauno put her to sleep on the sofa\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Adventurer Guild Headquarters.</p><br/><p>In it, talks were being conducted, from the defense of Fortress Redant, to the changing situation of neighboring lands.</p><br/><p>It was fine and all that a country had fallen, but in its place, the superpower of Bahnseim was now in contact with them.</p><br/><p>The royalty that had fled from the land had taken flight to Bahnseim, but it didn\u2019t seem they wished to retake power. No, they weren\u2019t in a situation where they could make such demands.</p><br/><p>They had overlooked a Labyrinth running out of control, and brought great damage to other countries. If Bahnseim supported them to reestablish their country, Beim wouldn\u2019t keep quiet. But as they wanted some land between them and Bahnseim, Beim\u2019s opinion was to wring them out to an extent where they wouldn\u2019t collapse.</p><br/><p>The reality was already beyond what those involved desired.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did the messenger of Bahnseim say?\u201d</p><br/><p>That meeting of executives gathered from the branches discussed how to deal with Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo particular demands. As we have now become neighbors, they wish to keep the national border what it was before, and they want to open a space for various discussions in regards to tariffs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those negotiations would fall into the merchants\u2019 territory. Not the Guild.</p><br/><p>Watching over the meetingroom, Tanya was participating as the guard of her superior, the East Branch\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo shall the Guild treat them as we have before?\u201d</p><br/><p>When someone offered that statement, the moderator leading the meeting nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible they may put out a request to borrow our strength in monster subjugation. But Bahnseim is a large nation. They have their backbone, so perhaps they won\u2019t send such requests our way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The executives smiled.</p><br/><p>They were making light of the stubbornness of nobles, and thinking they would come crying to Beim eventually.</p><br/><p>The South Branch\u2019s executive spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you think of Bahnsim, they\u2019ve had quite a few rebellion these years. I would like to be more assertive in dispatching mercenaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the moderator nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been quiet in Zayin and Beim these days, after all. It\u2019s a fact that the mercenaries have lost a place to earn. We\u2019ll put in a proposal to the merchants.\u201d</p><br/><p>The South Branch\u2019s executive smiled on those words. No, he looked a little relieved.</p><br/><p>Tanya spoke to her superior.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t been making much lately. Just the other day, they forced their way into taking over a Labyrinth Subjugation request, but they\u2019re getting quite impatient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tanya\u2019s superior, levelly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that not dangerous? Thinking of the importance of mercenary brigades, what will happen if we send them to a land with so much internal discord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They were both adventurers\u2019 Guilds of Beim, but their objectives were different. And the East Branch didn\u2019t think highly of the South Branch\u2019s rough way of doing things.</p><br/><p>When adventurers of the East Branch were dispatched, a large portion of their reasons for worry started from the South Branch\u2026 the mercenaries.</p><br/><p>At present, it seems they were thinking of sending their mercs, who\u2019d built up their frustration, to rampage across Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that is their job. Well, not all of them are good people, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re any different.\u201d</p><br/><p>And the conference turned to a certain topic.</p><br/><p>Once more, it was due to an utterance from the South Branch\u2019s executive.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to think of it, that adventurer of the East Branch\u2026 Lyle Walt was a noble who flowed in from Bahnseim, was he?\u201d</p><br/><p>On his forced phrasing, Tanya\u2019s superior nodded with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, it\u2019s quite famous how the Walt House\u2019s daughter married into Bahnseim royalty. She\u2019s been rampaging around quite flashily, but she is still the queen of a major country. Isn\u2019t it time for us to show some good will?\u201d</p><br/><p>To the South Branch executive, who was trying to take actions disadvantageous to Lyle, Tanya\u2019s superior\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you call it good will\u2026 It\u2019s true he was driven out, but from then on, there hasn\u2019t been any intervention from Bahnseim. I doubt it would be profitable to poke around the thorn bush.\u201d</p><br/><p>The South Branch hung on obstinately.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s precisely why. If they come to learn of it later, it may raise doubt towards us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moderator listened to the words of the two. And he gave down a verdict.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Negotiations haven\u2019t even begun. Let us take action after watching how things go. And he is being useful to the Guild. It is our policy to treasure those that bring a profit to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meaning weighing Lyle and Celes on the scales, if the profit Lyle produced fell short of her, they would cut him off at any moment.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Lyle-kun, just what the hell did you say to the South Branch\u2019s executive?)</p><br/><p>Tanya sighed internally as she worried for Lyle\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

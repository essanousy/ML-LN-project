Written on the paper were his comrades\u2019 names and dates. And what he had done with them to that point.</p><br/><p>Looking over it all, Lyle gave a satisfied nod.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat should be enough. I think I can take it easy for the rest of the month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Written in were his activities with his party from Novem to May. Whether he gave a present or had a date, or a pleasant conversation\u2026 it was all scrawled in great detail and properly managed.</p><br/><p>But the Fifth, who spoke less than any of the other ancestors, wrung out his voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou idiot! Shannon\u2019s extremely low, isn\u2019t she!\u300f</p><br/><p>Lyle hurriedly checked his memos, and sure enough, his time spend with Shannon was low. But Lyle felt relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Shannon, is it? That\u2019s alright. Because I\u2019m quite sure that girl hates me.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, the Sixth let out a satisfied voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right. Well, she\u2019s just tagging along with Miranda, so you\u2019re not in that sort of relationship yet. Fifth, let\u2019s just take it easy and\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>But a frantic Fifth superseded that opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou keep quiet, fool~! Just how many failures has that train of thought led you to\u2026 I followed through so many times for you! And if you\u2019ll let me have my say\u2026 you\u2019re all na\u00efve! Listen here, none of you feel a sense of crisis!\u300f</p><br/><p>Cutting it there, the Fifth gasped for breath before explaining to Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u300eListen well, those arbitrary thoughts like, \u2018that should be enough\u2019, and, \u2019yeah, that looks good\u2019, don\u2019t get through to women! Just how much careful caution did I take around the Sixth\u2019s wives\u2026 this man draws nothing but landmine women to him.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third raised a perplexed voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eHuh? But you know, all his wives passed the precepts, didn\u2019t they?\u300f</p><br/><p>The one to answer that question was the Seventh. A hint of grief lingered in the Seventh\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, without a doubt, each one of them was talented on their own. If of the three, only one had married into the Walt House, I\u2019m sure we wouldn\u2019t have any problems at all. It\u2019s because he took all three that we went through hell.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth refuted the surrounding opinions.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Even I thought two was no good. But you see, if you have two, it becomes a competition and that\u2019s nothing but trouble, so I went and got a third\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>I offered my frank response to his resolution.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t pour oil on the fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fifth seemed irritated.</p><br/><p>\u300eAnd because of that, I went through my troubles. Because I paid too much mind for my son\u2019s wives, I had to follow through for my own wives as well, and\u2026 anyways! Listen well, Lyle. Negligence alone should be avoided at all costs. Throw away all your assumptions! The ones surrounding you aren\u2019t some weak damsels in distress. Imagine yourself surrounded by ravenous tigers and bears!\u300f</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that going a bit too far?</p><br/><p>Or so the other members thought, but when you thought over it, every gathered had a peculiarity or two. While they wouldn\u2019t call them wild animals, they were definitely danger.</p><br/><p>And Shannon held demon eyes that required special attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, understood. I\u2019ll go out with Shannon. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be happy if we go see the food stalls and minstrels.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lyle tried to play it safe, the Fifth yelled at him.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhere do you think those simplistic thoughts will lead you!? You need some more careful caution or else..\u300f</p><br/><p>There, a knock came at the door. Not a worker of the inn, Lyle confirmed with his Skills that it was Monica before calling out a, \u2018come in\u2019.</p><br/><p>As Monica entered, she saw that Lyle was preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, are you going out? I thought I\u2019d hear out if you have any requests for lunch, but if that\u2019s the case, are you eating out? Anyways, where will you be going? If you need a baggage carrier, please use this Monica as you will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her appearance was that of a beautiful girl, but inside she was an automaton who could exhibit physical strength exceeding that of adults. She was convenient for carrying things, but as she looked like a woman, if Lyle actually used her to carry things, the surrounding eyes would grow cold.</p><br/><p>Lyle continued his preparations.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m eating lunch out. I\u2019m going out with Shannon, so could you stay at the inn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica took his words in terror.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what\u2019s this? You mean to say you won\u2019t be going out with me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Good luck innsitting.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he left the room, Monica crouched and cowered and saw Lyle off.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-have a good day. Goddammit!! Chicken dickwad, you damn fool!\u201d</p><br/><p>After calling out to Shannon, Lyle went out to the town of Beim.</p><br/><p>He headed to where the performers performed, and of them brought his feet to where the singers sang their songs. But Shannon was in a bad move.</p><br/><p>While they walked with linked hands, Lyle looked at Shannon and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You like songs, don\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>Shannon was walking mindful of her chest, and she offered Lyle a complaint.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh shut it. I\u2019ve already been here recently, so I\u2019ve already heard all the songs and tales they have to tell. Won\u2019t you take me somewhere else!?\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2026 T-this girl\u2026 ever since I took her out, she\u2019s done nothing but complain.)</p><br/><p>Irritated as he was, he understood it would be no fun to hear tales one\u2019d heard before, and made for somewhere else.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you go out often?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon brushed her hair aside as she answered Lyle\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my sister, right? And Eva goes out a lot, so I sometimes tag along. Though Aria just goes around the food stalls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you get along well with Eva?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem and Miranda, the two were at odds, so factions were forming among the harem members. Because of that, hearing of Shannon of Miranda\u2019s faction going out with Eva was joyous news to Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem told me to go out with someone. But our conversations don\u2019t really mesh, and there\u2019s everything that\u2019s happening with my sister, so it\u2019s like she wants to keep some distance too, perhaps?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Lyle made a stiff smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>(I wonder why they can\u2019t get along.)</p><br/><p>A factional war was being formed around Novem and Miranda. If possible, Lyle wanted to somehow have Shannon help both sides make up.</p><br/><p>It seemed that a troupe that had arrived in Beim quite recently had begun singing the songs they gathered on their travels, so Lyle and Shannon headed there to listen in.</p><br/><p>It was a troupe of elves, and while they were small in scale, they had an energy to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next song up is a song of the Hero of the distant land of Cartaffs! If anyone holds interest in such a tale, by all means plant your feet and listen in!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the male elf said that, it seems those around held no interest in Cartaffs, as the customers began to disperse. While some remained, the topic was surely not a popular one.</p><br/><p>But without changing their expressions, the elves burst into song.</p><br/><p>The song of Cartaff\u2019s hero who once performed in an old war with Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>The tale of the brave knight who fought to protect a young noble girl.</p><br/><p>But at the end, the girl married a blood-relative of the lord she served under, and the knight watched the night sky alone.</p><br/><p>It was a song without a happy ending.</p><br/><p>(That was a bit questionable. Perhaps the customers left because they knew the ending?)</p><br/><p>Lyle thought as he listened to the verses. But Shannon was gripping his hand tight, listening in all earnesty, and he didn\u2019t want to put a damper on her mood, so he kept quiet. Bringing his gripped hand closer to her face, Shannon looked on in pure seriousness.</p><br/><p>There, the Fourth seemed fed up as he offered advice to Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, look at Shannon\u2019s chest. Can you see the present you bought for her in Centralle? When this is over, praise her for it.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third spoke to the Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat, you said it already? You should\u2019ve just waited until he noticed.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth sighed as he spoke back.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle\u2019s growth aside, I felt bad for Shannon.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that, he noticed Shannon had the pendent he\u2019d bought in Bahnseim\u2019s capital of Centralle hung at her chest. It was something cheap, but she was looking after it quite carefully.</p><br/><p>Once the song was over, and the applause broke out, Shannon gave a large clap of her hands. The customers tossed their coins forward. Lyle looked at Shannon\u2019s delight, and produced a silver coin from his coin purse.</p><br/><p>It seems she was quite pleased with that one.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new songs! A nice one, I like it quite a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Shannon\u2019s delight, Lyle gave a warm smile as he placed the coin into the container an elf had brought forward. There, the elves frantically gave tidy bows.</p><br/><p>Getting a large copper was for the fortunate. Looking at the stopped feet, the song hadn\u2019t been popular.</p><br/><p>But Lyle threw a silver coin in.</p><br/><p>(Well, looks like Shannon\u2019s happy, so I guess it\u2019s fine.)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBye-bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leading Shannon by the hand, he left the area.</p><br/><p>Once there were fewer people around, Lyle looked at Shannon.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you actually wore that necklace.\u201d</p><br/><p>There- a little surprised- Shannon spoke bashfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-of course I did. Aren\u2019t you a little slow to notice?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them laughed as they walked off to find some place to eat. The Fifth seemed truly relieved.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow look at that. Look at that! \u2026 She\u2019s already taken to him. That was dangerous. If we left her aside any longer, that would definitely have been dangerous!\u300f</p><br/><p>Perhaps the Fifth was drawing closer to the Sixth as the Sixth broke into hurried words.</p><br/><p>\u300eY-you\u2019re right. It was my mistake, so you don\u2019t have to criticize me so.\u300f</p><br/><p>It seems the Fifth was harassing the Sixth in unexpected ways.</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Head (\uff1b\u00b4\u0414\uff40): \u201cFollowing through for my son\u2019s three wives was one of my greatest troubles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sixth Generation\u2019s Wives ( \u309c\u309c): \u201cYou say something, father-in-law? More importantly\u2026 where could Fiennes be? And could you hear out our complaints?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sixth Generation Head (\uff1b \u30fb`\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cI\u2019m sooorrryy!! Ah, by the way, they decided to do a second print run on Sevens Volume 1. Please forgive me by that grace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Head (\u30fd\u00b4\u03c9`): \u201cHahaha\u2026 I\u2019m definitely never forgiving you. Never. And today once more, my animals are my only solace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Wives ( \u309c\u309c): \u201cOur husband\u2019s going to be taken by our son\u2019s wives again\u2026 we definitely can\u2019t forgive this. This is why we hate wives.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But for those that suffered heavy damage, we had to ignore the materials, and collect only the stones.</p><br/><p>The knights and magicians poured oil in the hole, and set it alight.</p><br/><p>While the smoke rose to the sky, I wore a mask to inspect the process as I spoke with Alette-san.</p><br/><p>As we walked side by side, there were some soldiers who greeted me as we passed. Among them, soldiers who blatantly clicked their tongues at me\u2026</p><br/><p>The dissatisfaction of the knights and soldiers of Lorphys was considerable, it seems.</p><br/><p>Alette-san apologized.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. Quite a few of them understand it in their heads, but their feelings don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly shook my head to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve done enough to deserve it, after all. Now then, continuing out talk\u2026 Division of the stones and materials, was it? We\u2019ll take the Giant Kong, but everything else can be split with you and Zayin, fifty-fifty. Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Alette-san looked at me, her face warping a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine with that, but in that case, you\u2019ll lose out on your share. Our side was estimating thirty to forty percent, just to let you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Zayin and Lorphys likely wanted the Magic Stones and Materials enough to sprout hands from their throats. Because they wouldn\u2019t have to buy them off from Beim.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll accept a few on my side. The Giant Kong\u2019s Magic Stone was of considerable quality, it seems, and with the materials in my hands as well, I\u2019ve earned more than planned, so there isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true, but that wasn\u2019t all. In truth, my wallet was stuffed with merchant backing, starting with the Tr\u0113s House. Even after putting out condolence money, I would have some left over.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Zayin and Lorphys would require large amounts of stones and materials soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve already discussed it with Lonbolt-san and Gastone-san, so don\u2019t worry about it. Just split it in half, and head home. Oh, and please don\u2019t dispute about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I joked around, Alette-san let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think we have that sort of strength left in us? Once we\u2019ve finished up here, the main force is returning to the country. I want to get them back quickly. Because the movements of Galleria and Rusworth are bothering me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were two countries boasting equal, or greater national power than Zayin and Lorphys. Four countries of about the same scale.. that was the current state of Beim\u2019s surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they warring especially hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 When we sent out scouts, it seems it wasn\u2019t just skirmishes. They\u2019re truly monsters, it seems. Both parties have their female leaders at the forefront of every battle, so there\u2019s little a gap. Good grief, in that case, it would\u2019ve been better we left Selva in-between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could only give a bitter smile. Perhaps noticing my sarcasm, Alette-san apologized again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. That wasn\u2019t my intent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Now then, let\u2019s start preparing. I\u2019m sure the folks from Beim will come to buy off our Magic Stones soon, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why Beim? And what do you mean they\u2019ll come to buy them off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Alette-san\u2019s confusion, I grinned, laughed, and explained.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 At Beim\u2019s Guild Headquarter, Gastone and Lonbolt were carrying out an intense back and forth.</p><br/><p>Gaston\u2019s face was bright red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this; asking us to hand over the Magic Stones and materials we risked our lives to obtain!? And saying you\u2019ll pay nothing to retake control of the fortress that prevented the advance of such an army of evil is simply too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Beim\u2019s executive personnel heard out his piece with bitter sentiment.</p><br/><p>They had arbitrarily butted in to participate, and now they were saying they wouldn\u2019t sell the Magic Stones and materials. They likely planned to take them home, and use them in their countries.</p><br/><p>But the executive staff didn\u2019t think the knights and soldiers of both countries would return alive. That fact had largely twisted their plans.</p><br/><p>The merchants were quite forceful in their demand for the Guild to somehow dispose of the equipment that had been left over.</p><br/><p>One of the executives spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about trading for arms and armor? I\u2019m sure your side has lost much equipment, so if it\u2019s now\u2026 we\u2019ll accept around this.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he displayed a conversion rate, it was Lonbolt\u2019s turn to let his body go read up to the head, with an expression like that of a boiling octopus.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reward we attained from fighting with our lives on the line can only be traded for so little? What\u2019s more, where we fall short, we\u2019ll have to pay with gold, you say!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The executive immediately apologized.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no, that is a misunderstanding. I understand. Then magic stones of this amount\u2026 how about this much?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rate was immediately altered, but the two men weren\u2019t satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven in normal times, these rates would be strange. Are you taking us for fools? We didn\u2019t need any equipment from the start. The Magic Stones and materials are plenty.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the Guild\u2019s executive officers, it would be troublesome if the two counties made off with them. Of all else, they had refrained from getting their hands on a week\u2019s worth of monster drops, and the resources they had saved up had been exchanged to weapons.</p><br/><p>Meaning they had suddenly fallen into a dearth of Magic Stones and monster parts.</p><br/><p>At the rate, problems would surface across the branches, so the executive staff looked amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 In that case, we shall annul any remaining debt of both your countries. On top of that, an exchange with the weapons we have in store. How does that sound? Also, this is are final concession.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the serious faces of the executives, Gastone and Lonbolt made vexed faces.</p><br/><p>But the Guild personnel thought.</p><br/><p>(Even if they act tough, the national power to oppose Beim isn\u2019t something either of their countries possesses.)</p><br/><p>When Gastone nodded, Lonbolt reluctantly nodded as well. But then Gastone\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 But giving it all would be troublesome on our side. At the very least, I\u2019d like you to leave it at taking seventy percent of what we\u2019ve reaped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lonbolt was the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor us as well. Having nothing left at all is out of the discussion. Even after returning to the country, I won\u2019t be able to persuade a soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Guild executives, after crunching some numbers, determined they would be able to somehow overcome the present situation, before smiling and nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well. From the portion taken by both your countries, Beim shall take over seventy percent. We shall prepare the weapons and armor on our side, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to confirm it, so all you need do is send men to pick it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Lonbolt looked annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019ll have us shoulder the transportation costs.\u201d</p><br/><p>An executive smiled wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is only because a quantity check is necessary. You wouldn\u2019t want twice the effort, would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The executives, Gastone, and Lonbolt looked over the forms written up. And after confirming their contents, they signed them.</p><br/><p>Beim\u2019s side was smiling, while Gastone and Lonbolt looked down with their shoulders shaking. The executive personnel were certain they were considerably irritated.</p><br/><p>Behind the two who were thought to be vexed at the outcome, in the clothes of Zayin\u2019s temple maidens, stood May\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>Soldiers and mercenaries of Beim set to be stationed at the fortress dropped by.</p><br/><p>But besides them, mercenaries hired to recover stones and materials, as well as transport squads were sent in large numbers.</p><br/><p>The important-looking existences called the free knights of Beim came to the fortress, and lined up before us as we sat in the chairs of the commanders\u2019 room.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work with defense. Henceforth, this fortress shall come back under Beim\u2019s management. You can return at once if you so desire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Me, Alette-san, and Noy-san. The three of us were side by side.</p><br/><p>You can return at once pretty much meant get out of here already.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, this is the decision of your superiors. Seventy percent of the Magic Stones and materials will be conceded to Beim. You\u2019ve my thanks for making it easier by neatly dividing and sorting them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the new commander of the fortress, who was purposely trying to rile us up, the Third spoke after bursting into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis one\u2019s no good. While we\u2019re at it, should we get him demoted as well? It\u2019s best the commander here be a proficient one.\u300f</p><br/><p>Milleia-san agreed as she giggled.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m also for it. Now then, how shall we kick him of that high seat he\u2019s sitting in?\u300f</p><br/><p>As approval circled around, they immediately devised a means to kick him out on the spot.</p><br/><p>(These guys\u2019 personalities are way too terrible.)</p><br/><p>As I thought that, the free knight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, also, leave behind the cannons that performed so well in battle. It\u2019ll just be a bother for you to carry them back to Beim, after all. You can\u2019t even use them there, right? We shall put them to better use.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was dumbfounded. Noy-san couldn\u2019t stay quiet at that one.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s simply too much. Those cannons are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped Noy-san, and shook my head. To the end, before the newly-appointed commander, I had to play the part of a single adventurer of weak standing.</p><br/><p>But I could hear the Fifth contain his laughter.</p><br/><p>\u300eC-could it be this one is actually trying to be considerate of us?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth gave a grand laugh as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eHe\u2019s so kind I\u2019m being moved to tears. He\u2019s incompetent, but this is a miracle! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll actually forget his face!\u300f</p><br/><p>I looked at the commander.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re telling us to leave the cannons, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Taking something like that to the city will be nothing but trouble. But you\u2019ve sure put them to good use. For that alone, I don\u2019t mind commending you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, the Seventh gave a delightful voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eAnd I don\u2019t mind commending your actions. A splendid man. For you to offer material to get you kicked out of office of your own accord, you really have a form of talent there. From our eyes, that is.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Understood. Well then, we\u2019ve preparations to make.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching us regretfully leave the room, the fortress\u2019 new commander haughtily stretched himself over the chair in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>By the way, I was also quite satisfied.</p><br/><p>(But seventy percent, is it? I was prepared for eighty to ninety, but I wonder if Gastone-san and co. were able to do well.)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Leaving the fortress behind us, we returned to Beim.</p><br/><p>I immediately brought my feet to the Tr\u0113s House\u2019s door. I had to make rounds to all the houses that backed us, but there was also something I had to report to Vera.</p><br/><p>When I entered the mansion, Vera raced over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle! You\u2019re not injured, right! If you are, I won\u2019t forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Accepting her embrace, I gave a bitter smile. In the mansion\u2019s entrance hall were her younger sister Gina, and Gina\u2019s boyfriend Roland, watching us from a little ways away.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san perhaps surveying the surroundings\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Fidel-san isn\u2019t here. It\u2019s a bit of a shame. I wanted to fan his flames before his eyes again. You can\u2019t imagine how many moves and lines I\u2019ve thought up for that.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third spoke as it to console her.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s alright. We\u2019ve got as many chances to stir him up as we want, from here on. Anyways, a single, \u2018father-in-law\u2019 is enough to make his rage cross the limit, so I can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ve got.\u300f</p><br/><p>These ones really do have terrible personalities.</p><br/><p>And I made an apologetic face to Vera. In all seriousness, I really was sorry. The ancestors convinced me to concede the cannon to that commander free knight, so I followed along.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 well, I couldn\u2019t take the cannons back. Beim\u2019s free knights said to leave them at the fortress\u2026 and guns and gunpowder as well. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Vera burst into rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about something like that. I can just have more made. You\u2019re safe, and that\u2019s enough. Or were there any other injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said there weren\u2019t any serious injuries among my party members, she looked relieved.</p><br/><p>Seeing the scene, the Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Yep, I think Vera-chan resembles my wife, just a bit.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth spoke nostalgically.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis thorny kindness definitely does remind me of mama.\u300f</p><br/><p>He said.</p><br/><p>And the Seventh opened his mouth, enjoying himself.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then, from here on is the fun part. I never thought the day would come for me to give thanks to Beim\u2019s adventurers and merchants. Lyle, it\u2019s fun time!\u300f</p><br/><p>Ignoring the high-tensioned ancestors, I told Vera the just of our defensive war.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 At the Guild\u2019s main headquarters, taking his subordinates along, Fidel slammed a document down on the table.</p><br/><p>His opponents, the Guild\u2019s executive personnel, were shaking before one of the top merchants of the city.</p><br/><p>Fidel had heard the circumstances from Vera, and marched straight to the ones that had dispatched that free knight, Beim\u2019s adventurers\u2019 guild headquarters.</p><br/><p>The forms were proof that the cannon and heavy weaponry had been borrowed from Fidel. Thinking it would be a pain if Lyle was going to be reluctant to return them, the man had personally written them up himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you read them? Now read them again, and keep reading until you\u2019re sure there are no problems. This isn\u2019t just as a merchant, it\u2019s something you all need to keep mindful of as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Guild executives sat in their chairs, and tried making themselves look smaller.</p><br/><p>\u201cE-even if he didn\u2019t know, for a free knight to thoughtlessly do something like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In regards to the executives that had begun to make excuses, Fidel erupted. His mind remained calm, but he let his expression fill with rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you to give an excuse!? What I\u2019m asking is how you plan to take responsibility! Just how much value do you think your excuses hold?\u201d</p><br/><p>The executives were likely loathing those free knights they had dispatched already. Even if they were called knights, they were former soldiers and adventurers.</p><br/><p>The Guild took care of such management, while merchants could hold private armies and maintain military power separately.</p><br/><p>Meaning the Guild had basically unlawfully seized the equipment of Fidel\u2019s own private army.</p><br/><p>The executives all apologized at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe offer our deepest apologies! We shall retrieve and deliver it at once!\u201d</p><br/><p>But Fidel wasn\u2019t satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was something loaded onto one of our company\u2019s ships. You mean for us to sail the seas unarmed? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll reimburse me for the loss I\u2019ll face in their absence, right? I was preparing to set out as soon as I heard the borrower had returned, yet it turns out it wasn\u2019t broken, but stolen. Of course, there\u2019s a problem with the one I lent it to, but you also have fault for stealing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The contract held that if Lyle broke them on the battlefield, he wouldn\u2019t have to pay reparations. Fidel thought something like that wasn\u2019t much a problem.</p><br/><p>But if he could squeeze money out of another party, it was a different story. What\u2019s more, this time, the Guild hadn\u2019t been of any use. He had his dissatisfactions at them, and his actions also had the meaning of getting back at them.</p><br/><p>One of the executives.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We will take charge of your losses on our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Fidel spoke in discontentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was more a thief or bandit than a commander, but is he really worthy of commanding Fortress Redant? It doesn\u2019t look that way to me. How about you try sending someone a little more decent next time? That\u2019s an important transport point. I think it\u2019ll be too late once a problem\u2019s already happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Guild staff immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll send talented personnel at once. The dispatched commander will receive a harsh penalty, so could this matter be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well. But having others know I was stolen from will have them make light of me. Won\u2019t the Guild be troubled by strange rumors too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-that is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, Fidel made a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sure\u2026 so, sign this form.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he took out another document, the executive officers\u2019 faces stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make it that I sold it to you. Use the cannons and guns for the fortress\u2019 defense. In exchange, I\u2019ll have twelve new cannons and guns made for my ships, and the Guild will shoulder the cost.\u201d</p><br/><p>The true number of cannons handed off at the fortress was ten. There wasn\u2019t a man here that knew that fact, so they silently nodded.</p><br/><p>Watching the Guild officers sign, Fidel nodded with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really were a lot of problems this time around. But I don\u2019t mean to condemn you all for it. In the next meeting, I\u2019ll advocate for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, they gave their thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-thank you for your consideration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how can I thank the Tr\u0113s House. I\u2019ll definitely return the favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will prepare the funds at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside, Fidel thought\u2026</p><br/><p>(\u2026 More than this lot, that gigolo puts up a greater resistance. Rather, that damn gigolo really survived\u2026 he\u2019s got the tenacity of a cockroach.)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>As I walked through Beim\u2019s streets with Eva, I recalled the previous events, and made a tired expression.</p><br/><p>Putting my right hand to left shoulder, I lightly turned my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get used to that atmosphere back there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scene I remembered was being surrounded by elves, and interrogated on my life experiences and sentiment on the battlefield. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder just where their zeal was coming from.</p><br/><p>After talking quite a bit, I paid the elf tribes that had taken part, and saw off their departure from Beim.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sure the travelling elf troupes that joined in would avoid Bahnseim and spread around the continent in no time.</p><br/><p>Eva delightedly walked to my side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something good happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>She stopped in her tracks, and made a pose as she spun around. She was a beauty, so it made for a pretty picture, but the surrounding people stopped, looked at her, and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is, a number of my songs are entering the market! As a daughter of the Nihil tribe leading the elves, my name shall be carved onto the slate of history!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than feel embarrassed at having her name come out, it seems she felt quite delighted. The fact her personality was the polar opposite of mine made a cynical smile emerge on my face.</p><br/><p>Letting out a sigh, I walked with Eva towards the mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, as long as the rumors spread, all\u2019s well.\u201d</p><br/><p>She sent a wink at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. This time\u2019s events were flashy, and historic, and what\u2019s more, we even paid travel expenses and rewards, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll happily spread the tale. But up to now, you always said you didn\u2019t want to be sung of, or recited, so what\u2019s with the sudden change of heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Eva tilted her head, I looked up at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it became necessary, so I put it to action. That\u2019s all it is. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Maybe you really will be telling my hero\u2019s tale someday.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I quietly said it below audible level, Eva grabbed my shoulders, and pulled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what is it? Say it properly. Don\u2019t leave me hanging.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pulled by Eva, I laughed, before taking her hand, and leading her all the way to the mansion.</p><br/><p>Milleia (#\u30fb\u2200\u30fb): \u201cLyle receiving cockroach treatment\u2026 I cannot forgive it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation Head \u30d8(\u309c\u2200\u309c\u30d8): \u201cQuite right (lol), so next time, we\u2019re riling him especially hard (lolol).\u201d</p><br/><p>Milleia \u3002\u309c(*\u309c\u00b4\u2200\uff40\u309c)\u309c\u30ce: \u201cI just can\u2019t wait (lolol), and wait, the people of Beim are so kind, it\u2019s bringing tears to my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Generation Head ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cIt\u2019s true. They give us equipment and money for free. On top of that, they even give us fame. Speak ill of them, and the goddess will punish you (lol).\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Head ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cNo, it really is true. Just how much do they plan on contributing to us? They do it even if they hate us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation Head (\u30fbA\u30fb): \u201cBut in the end, we\u2019ll definitely be parasiting\u2026 no, I mean policing them.

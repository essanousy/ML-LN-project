You usually don\u2019t get that many, do you now? But there was a reason I had to do that! How about you think about my feelings when I had a need to get that many children\u2026 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Generation ( \u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40): \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation ( \u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40): \u201dI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Celes is a reincarnator with a cheat~.</p><br/><p>A: Second Generation \u30fd(\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)/ : \u201cWrong.

Do you perhaps hate little sisters, author?</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation (\u00b4\u2200\uff40) : \u201cThey definitely are dangerous, but the author doesn\u2019t hate them, and he has some twisted delusions about them. How foolish~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: The ancestors interfere too much.

It\u2019s strange because you\u2019re thinking of it as implying he\u2019s the \u2018Seventh\u2019 of something. How about thinking it as a pluralization of 7? \u2026 no good, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation (\u30fb\u2200\u30fb) : \u201cJust say there\u2019s some deeper meaning or some bullshit like that to put them off. They\u2019ll forget it eventually! (The truth is, the deeper meaning in the title is\u2026 oh, my, I can\u2019t say any further).\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

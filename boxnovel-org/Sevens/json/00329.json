I think I\u2019m going to give up on today\u2019s address. See, I\u2019m sure it was a bad premonition.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said such a thing over breakfast, those around didn\u2019t seem to mind it too much. Monica carrying the food over, and Damien\u2019s automatons seemed somewhat excited as they saw the large portion of the meal that had been eaten away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what I\u2019m talking about, this! Ah, at this moment we are sparkling brilliantly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Born to serve humans, it seems they were delighted at having fulfilled that duty. Before my eyes, May eating so much meat so early in the morning was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my meat!\u201d</p><br/><p>But Shannon pinched a portion and ate it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine? I\u2019m still a growing girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Shannon\u2019s chest as I scoffed. There, an eaten-clean bone hit my face. \u2018What are you looking at!?\u2019 said Shannon, so I sent a look of pity at her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at your chest that hasn\u2019t shown any signs of growth at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda munched on toast as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cShannon, quiet down. So what sort of dream was it, Lyle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Normally, it was Novem who reacted to me, but the current Novem would only eat and nothing more. Miranda called my name so I raised my face.</p><br/><p>I wiped my mouth off with the towel Monica brought over.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to this, the truth is, last night\u2019s dream was terrible. When I woke up in the morning, there was a naked woman sleeping next to me, and\u2026 no, this is all part of the dream okay? Not reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said something about a naked woman, the slightly boisterous mobile fortress dining hall had grown silent. When I properly explained it was a dream, General Blois spoke uninterestedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right before the decisive battle, so when I think of who could be sleeping beside you\u2026 we\u2019ll have to carry the bets over to the post-war period.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baldoir seemed to feel the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use Lyle-sama to gamble. But having come so far, to be honest, I\u2019m not sure what to think about you sleeping alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>A little down, Maksim-san pierced food with his fork.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can\u2019t you just go for Novem-dono? And I\u2019ve already placed a considerable sum on her, so just decide already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t say it so carelessly. Damien took up the drink put out by one of his automatons.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving still yet to decide on a partner, it\u2019s quite Lyle-esque, or how should I put it\u2026 what\u2019s your take on it, old Letarta?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Letarta who\u2019d been eating heartily stuffed his cheeks with meat.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I place my bets too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Damien called out an automaton and began relaying the current odds and contenders to the dwarf. I cleared my throat.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Anyways, there was a woman so I jumped to my feet. I couldn\u2019t see her face, but she was naked so I panicked, and Miranda opened the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda looked a little happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, so you like me so much I come out in your dreams?\u201d</p><br/><p>But I instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 She was holding a knife with a scary look on her face. I cried out, \u2018I\u2019m still wearing all my clothes, so it\u2019s probably a misunderstanding\u2019, and ran off. A look in her eyes and I could tell. I was going to be killed at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, looking at Miranda\u2019s frozen expression, Aria and Gracia covered their mouthes as they withheld their laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s possible. Miranda\u2019d really do it, that girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I can imagine it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muscleheads the both of them, they had much to talk about, and were getting along as of late. Miranda\u2019s eyes was taking them in. But that\u2019s fine for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo when I ran out, it turns out I was inside this fortress. Running down the narrow corridors, I found Elza.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elza showed a twitch, but it wasn\u2019t anything too large.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was running around looking for Gracia, so I pointed at Miranda. Yeah, she\u2019s scary, so could you hold her off some? I asked.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt really sorry for Elza as she gave a crestfallen look, but anyways, I continued on with the dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cI ran outside and see, there were armed soldiers around waiting for me. As I looked around, I saw Aria on a horse looking at me. Those were definitely eyes full of hatred. Maybe because it was a dream, I was being chased around as if I was a traitor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bearing a grudge I had slept with someone I was being chased around\u2026 but the worst was yet to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cGracia was there too. So I ran to get away only to find Ludmilla in my path.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludmilla elegantly sipped some tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I got the drop on you. Looks like my dream self\u2019s quite competent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were in a bed and sleepwear for some reason, so I ran in a different direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ludmilla froze, Gracia and Elza pointed at her and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBringing a bed outside, how competent\u2026 pff!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, how competent. We\u2019d never be able to think up such a plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludmilla looked at the two of them, \u2018You know it\u2019s a dream,\u2019 she said in a threatening voice, so I continued on with the dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I finally got away and hid myself I found May.\u201d</p><br/><p>May ate her meat and continued munching on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEva was on her back, and she was poised with a bow. Ah, these guys are enemies too, I thought and ran when an arrow came flying from behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eva and May wiped their mouths.</p><br/><p>\u201cArchery on horseback\u2026 it\u2019s a bit difficult. Though I won\u2019t say I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI try to run without shaking to an extent. But I wouldn\u2019t chase Lyle around for something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I know. These two understood they were low on the order of precedence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew the skies would be dangerous so I fled into a cave. When I did, I found Clara reading a book in a dark room. I\u2019ve already sealed off all the exits, she said. And when she did, Vera came walking down the path I came with a smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vera sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, so you\u2019re saying I cooperated with Clara to corner you? No, that\u2019s a bit pushing it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hoping she\u2019d declare she wouldn\u2019t do it, Clara looked around at everyone\u2019s eyes in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a second. He\u2019s talking about a dream you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Ludmilla touched a hand to her chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dark horse\u2026 no, it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>I continued on.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I grew scared and somehow got away. In the end, I didn\u2019t know who I was sleeping next to, but I just kept getting chased, and when I woke up I was covered in sweat. Shannon came up and told me to wake up. Well, that was probably because she had come to wake me up and was calling out in reality. But I was so surprised I cried out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you let out a scream so early in the morning? How idiotic.\u201d</p><br/><p>In regards to Shannon\u2019s smile, there an individual blatantly dropping her shoulders. It was Monica.</p><br/><p>\u201cF-for me not to appear in the Chicken Dickwad\u2019s dream\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To her, Damien\u2019s automatons No. One Two and Three touched their mouths and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was being seriously chased around, and everyone\u2019s face looked scary you know. Hah, in the end, who was it\u2026 rather, a dream of being chased around by allies is definitely a nightmare. I think I\u2019ll give up on today.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, having heard the story, General Blois rubbed his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean it was Novem-dono? No, I mean the one sleeping next to you. By process of elimination.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica looked at General Blois.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve casually taken me out of the running? The only one who can shun me is the Chicken Dickhead. I don\u2019t get excited at all if another treats me coldly.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, it really was best to ignore her.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes gathered on Novem. But novem was a little dazed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? \u2026 U-um, is something the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>She stiffened in the middle of lifting her toast. There, Baldoir cleared his throats, and transferred everyone\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be troublesome if you avoided giving an address just because you had a bad dream. Today\u2019s the day you invade Centralle, for Pete\u2019s sakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, the allied army had gathered around Centralle. Before the city that showed not the slightest reaction, I was to give the final address.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh~? Let\u2019s make it a different day. It\u2019s a bad sign, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><br/><p>On my lack of motivation, Baldoir\u2019s eyebrows were twitching.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot happening. We already have all the preparations together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, I didn\u2019t seriously intent to stop it. It was just a breakfast conversation. I was quite tense myself, so I wanted to let myself loose a bit.</p><br/><p>But at the very least, I could understand Novem was brooding over it even more than I had anticipated.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Once upon a time, my ancestor\u2026 the previous Lyle had attacked Centralle.</p><br/><p>It was to eliminate the beautiful vixen, the source of the decline overcoming the country.</p><br/><p>To speak to results, he succeeded in defeating Agrissa.</p><br/><p>But the Bahnseim House\u2026 feudal nobles at the time, made off with all the glory. Pushing him off the stage of history, it turned out that the Bahnseim House saved the continent, founding the Kingdom of Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>Perhaps out of desperation, it seems he had erased the records quite thoroughly.</p><br/><p>From the start, my ancestor focused on nothing but Agrissa\u2019s defeat, and didn\u2019t advertise himself much to the public.</p><br/><p>At the time, he had a woman he was dating, or perhaps married to, and already had a child with her. The Forxuz House\u2019s Novem of the time\u2019s attempt to take down whatever Bahnseim built up was a story lost to the ages. The woman wished for peace, and Centralle entered the protection of the Bahnseim Monarchy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps that wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, based on how she went about it, she could have destroyed Bahnseim.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side of the moving fortress\u2019 stage, I muttered such a thing as I gripped the Jewel in my hand. To my side stood Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 She had given up on fighting. Rather than thinking of all the pain her husband suffered through it all, she had prioritized herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>I think that was taking it too far.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you had a child in your stomach, wouldn\u2019t you want to protect it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who responded to Novem in a fed-up tone was Aria. Holding her spear over her shoulder, she was waiting for the time to come.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Novem understood that as she didn\u2019t linger.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of that, the Bahnseim Kingdom was formed, and the continent divided. After that, they had a number of wise lords, but the Walt House was tormented by the Bahnseim House time and again. It wasn\u2019t only the Walt House either.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems the First was the grandson of the ancestor who defeated Agrissa.</p><br/><p>Our Founder, Basil Walt went independent with his first love as the trigger, and since he became a feudal lord, close to two hundred and fifty years had flowed by.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the preparations were in order, as Clara came over to me. And in the back, Eva prepared to use her Skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-san, we\u2019re ready. Eva is prepared to activate her Skill. What shall we do about the music?\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s play safe and do a dignified piece, with a movement to fire them up at the end, perhaps? Rather, Eva\u2019s Skill sure is convenient. It lets your voice reach people, and it can even make music at will.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Eva popped her face out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s convenient. But personally, I think live performances are best. And I don\u2019t really like it if my voice is only reaching through Skill. So don\u2019t make me use it too much, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>She waved her hands as she returned to her post. I gripped the Jewel.</p><br/><p>Miranda and Aria nearby called over to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow get out there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCinch it firmly. You\u2019re the supreme commander after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled at the two of them. Clara went off to move the mechanisms. And once the stage started to ruse, Novem looked at me and lowered her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, I\u2019m sure you have much to think about, but this Novem Forxuz\u2026 shall accompany you to the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do hope that end is the same end I\u2019m thinking of. I\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the stage reached its peak, I could hear Eva\u2019s music start up through her Skill. It felt as if their was an orchestra playing nearby.</p><br/><p>And I took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>Slowly, the stage rose, and positioned me so I could look over everyone. When it stopped I could feel the eyes gathering.</p><br/><p>It was time for the Third\u2019s Skill \u3010Dream\u3011. I could see Centralle\u2019s ramparts before my very eyes, and the allied armies that surrounded them.</p><br/><p>Right above me, I made an illusion of myself so everyone could see. I matched its movements to mine, making it reproduce whatever I did.</p><br/><p>My voice would reach, and my form was visible. With this, I\u2019m sure it would have a slight effect. As I heard the clamor I opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroes and heroines who\u2019ve gathered here today, lend me your ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Calling the knights and soldiers heroes, I praised them. They were heroes without a doubt. Standing against the heinous acts of Celes, they were to save the continent.</p><br/><p>And among them, just how many would return alive\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are many among you who\u2019ve lent ear to the atrocities the Bahnseim House has committed. Perhaps some among you have quivered under their brutality. But against it all, you stand! You are all without a doubt, heroes\u2026 and men of valor! In this battle of historic proportions, you shall definitely carve your names into history\u2019s slate!\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like that wasn\u2019t going to happen, but at least the fact they participated in this battle would remain.</p><br/><p>A song of dignified majesty was playing, and that atmosphere came out in my words as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we do not win this battle, then dark clouds loom over the future of the continent. And in truth, many sorrowful events have transpired. In Beim, a large number of casualties have come out from the army dispatched by Bahnseim. The inside of this country is the same. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen it on the way here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The towns and villages without vigor, and the lords and soldiers of doubtful character. Even when released and their sanity regained, they would turn back on all they had done, filled with a sense of guilt and regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cEventually this hell shall spread through Bahnseim to the continent as a whole. If we don\u2019t prevent it now, the lands shall be stained in fear and death! Here, now is the time to fight. Now is the time to decide our future!\u201d</p><br/><p>To many of those taking part, it they could call themselves justice, it made it easier to fight. If they thought they were doing something wrong, they couldn\u2019t help but give way to hesitation.</p><br/><p>When it came to life or death, doubt would be born.</p><br/><p>Especially when many of them were foreign soldiers without any relation to Bahnseim at all. Justice\u2026 if they didn\u2019t have a reason, they would never get serious with this battle.</p><br/><p>There was meaning to what they were doing. I had to teach them that. Even if that was for my own sake.</p><br/><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, in this large battle, I require your power. To defeat the fiendish line of Bahnseim, and exemplify righteousness to the continent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Using shills planted from the start and thought transference, the cheers began to spread.</p><br/><p>Ah, so this is how I\u2019m going to send so many men to their deaths. And as I thought over how many would die, I lifted up my fist.</p><br/><p>But someone had to do it. And I couldn\u2019t sit and wait around for the one who would.</p><br/><p>If they were there, I\u2019d obediently lend them my power, and perhaps plow a field or something in some remote land post-war. Just how many times easier would that be?</p><br/><p>If I stayed silent, the people gathered here wouldn\u2019t be in danger. But eventually Celes would move, and perhaps they would fall dead without resistance or meaning.</p><br/><p>While the surrounding countries still had power, I had to stop Celes at all costs.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think I was right. Whatever I was doing was exactly the same as her.</p><br/><p>Looking at someone like me, what would the ancestors think? Once more I\u2019d been told to flee to some land beyond Celes\u2019 hands.</p><br/><p>But even so, I was the one who chose to tread this bloodstained path. If I mulled over it, perhaps they would yell at me.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san had said it.</p><br/><p>To sit on a throne made over a mountain of corpses. And to grasp the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroes, grasp the future in your hands!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

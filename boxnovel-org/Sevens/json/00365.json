Rejecting such an appealing proposal within him, the man was undergoing quite a psychological conflict when he heard the voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cL-let go of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with us!\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman in a hood was surrounded by three men a little ways away from the coupled carriage. As he lent them an eye, they disappeared into the crowds.</p><br/><p>Erhart violently scratched his hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! I shouldn\u2019t have looked over.\u201d</p><br/><p>But since he\u2019d seen it, he had no choice but to help, thought he as he stood and hopped down from the carriage. But only after telling the coachman to depart without him if he didn\u2019t make it back in time.</p><br/><p>It was a narrow gap between buildings.</p><br/><p>Dimly lit, the trash bins left around caused a rotten stench to linger in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not going back. If I go back now, I\u2019ll be\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman showed her rejection before the three men.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be troubled if you keep selfish like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you plan to seek salvation from his imperial highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you make a plea, I doubt the emperor will move.\u201d</p><br/><p>The men seemed relatively lax. And they seemed somewhat tired of the woman.</p><br/><p>Hanging her head, the woman bit her lower lip\u2026</p><br/><p>The one who appeared to her was Erhart, his large sword over one shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, wait right there. Don\u2019t you feel embarrassed, three of you ganging up on one woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>In regards to Erhart\u2019s provocations, the three men seemed somewhat panicked. But once Erhart had entered that narrow space, one replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our problem. We\u2019d appreciate you stayed uninvolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the presumed leader\u2019s words, Erhart narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like the look of this at all. That\u2019s enough reason for me to involve myself. Or do you have your reasons?\u201d</p><br/><p>The men were lost for words, and it was clear there was something dark lingering behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Erhart approached, and while the three men had weapons at their hips, they came at him with their bare hands.</p><br/><p>Their movements were trained, the movements of those accustomed to battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s three on one\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the three men came at him in that narrow alley, Erhart intercepted with his hands as well.</p><br/><p>They were strong, but it\u2019s not as if the Free Knight title was something Lyle had simply handed out on a whim.</p><br/><p>Erhart was strong, and had earned it from his growth as an adventurer\u2026 and as a person.</p><br/><p>While it definitely was interesting, and there was some level of harassment alongside Lyle\u2019s personal feelings involved\u2026 anyways, Erhart was strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlad you could make it simple for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Striking them down, and laying them to rest on the dirty ground, Erhart let out a light breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the coupled carriage\u2019s already left.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, the woman leapt into Erhart\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? U-um\u2026 little lady, just because someone saved you, that doesn\u2019t mean you should trust a man so easily\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He grabbed the shoulders of the woman who had came at him, and as he tried to push her away, her hood slipped off.</p><br/><p>Her violet hair swayed, letting off a hint of perfume.</p><br/><p>Clouded eyes, and soft looking lips\u2026 were there before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Erhart-sama to be the one to come to my rescue.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flushed face of Annerinne.</p><br/><p>An inn of the imperial capital.</p><br/><p>Erhart was holding his head.</p><br/><p>The reason being, on top of the royal princess Annerinne coming to the capital, that very princess was the target of some group or another.</p><br/><p>It was nothing but trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You want to return to Lorphys at once?\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, he couldn\u2019t rely on his dastardly acquaintance Lyle.</p><br/><p>Since Annerinne was troubled, of course Erhart had proposed he talk to Lyle himself.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. And if those sorts are moving their hands around the imperial capital, I cannot seek aid from his majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Annerinne\u2019s downcast eyes, Erhart scratched his hair.</p><br/><p>(Is it something political? Come to think of it, it\u2019s not like the emperor can do anything, or so Lyle told me. Meaning she has some circumstance where even Lyle can\u2019t help out?)</p><br/><p>She had come to the capital in search of help, but she had already met an attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was careless. If only I\u2019d kept a better watch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her vexed face, Erhart folded his arms, and looked up at the ceiling in thought. But when he recalled the fact that he was an idiot, he could only let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cErhart-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Annerinne\u2019s worried glance, Erhart directed a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. I was just about to return myself. I\u2019ll safely deliver you to Lorphys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Locking her hands in front of her chest, Annerinne looked like she would curst into tears at any moment as she voiced her thanks again and again.</p><br/><p>(I hope her pursuers don\u2019t come after us. Though I doubt that\u2019s happening.)</p><br/><p>Could he protect her alone?</p><br/><p>Erhart hardened his resolve, and decided to make for Lorphys alongside Annerinne.</p><br/><p>Right around that time.</p><br/><p>In the palace, Lyle held an audience with the three men.</p><br/><p>Leader of the guards Baldoir seemed irritated as he looked at the three conspicuously injured men. For normally, they wouldn\u2019t be the sort allowed to hold a meeting with Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-your imperial highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the representative of the three worried men, Lyle stood from his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a preface. I\u2019ll play fool to the fact you raised a ruckus in my city. But is that really the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>The men nodded frantically with their bruised faces.</p><br/><p>Lyle put a hand to his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it would be a pain, but to think Erhart would\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Baldoir offered advice to Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, this matter isn\u2019t one we should involve ourselves in. This is Lorphys\u2019 problem, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle held up a hand to stop him, and he sent a glance to the maid keeping herself to the background of the room.</p><br/><p>Monica silently gave a curtsey and left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaldoir, do you know what I want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>In contrast to Baldoir\u2019s blatant displeasure, Lyle made a thin smile. Baldoir clenched his hand and closed his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d be troubled if I gain any more political fetters. But if it\u2019s someone of Erhart\u2019s caliber\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Free Knight Erhart\u2026 recalling the face of his dear friend, Lyle gave a warm smile.</p><br/><p>And once his expression turned serious, Lyle turned to look at the three men attempting to shrink their bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou raised some noise in the capital. So I\u2019ll be putting you three to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three men desperately lowered their heads to Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, it\u2019s been quite a while since things got fun around here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erhart was moving, and Lyle was moving as well.</p><br/><p>Those movements with Lorphys at the center would one day bring an influence to the entire continent.</p><br/><p>Monica *pant* (*\u00b4\u0414`) *pant*: \u201cMy chicken dickwad is too dreamy!

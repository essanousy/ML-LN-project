Beim had barely fought at all, but it was mainly opened to show that this was Beim\u2019s victory, and not anyone else\u2019s.</p><br/><p>The Guild\u2019s executives took part.</p><br/><p>And the merchants.</p><br/><p>The famous mercenary brigade chiefs.</p><br/><p>Within all that, I was participating with Vera. The other members were on standby at the mansion. The reason being we weren\u2019t invited.</p><br/><p>When I presented myself as Vera\u2019s company, surrounding eyes gathered on me.</p><br/><p>In the corner of an annoyed Fidel-san\u2019s field of vision, I flirted with Vera by the ancestors\u2019 instructions to fan the man\u2019s flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is tasty.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I took a bite of the food, Vera looked just a little fed-up. The reason was the surrounding reactions. They hadn\u2019t thought I would be attending, so I was attracting an excessive amount of attention, and yet no one tried to call out to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. When I thought it strange that you said you wanted to come\u2026 why are you even here? You\u2019re not enjoying this at all, are you Lyle?\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was different from Zayin\u2019s victory party, and all the food and drink lined up were high-class articles.</p><br/><p>I looked at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just wanted to see the latent power of Beim. Even after wasting so much money, still having this extent of financial leisure is just strange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fourth in the Jewel agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eExactly. It means we have to keep on wringing them out. And wringing them out isn\u2019t exactly an easy task.\u300f</p><br/><p>Well, they ignored all the efforts of we who did most of it, and opened up a party, so wanting to tease them was half my reason for being here. And accompanying Vera into the hall to rile Fidel up was the other half.</p><br/><p>If you wanted a bit of a more meaningful meaning, it was a provocative action towards Beim.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 What could this be? From Beim\u2019s point of view, am I a plague of misfortune?)</p><br/><p>The one who succeeded in defending the fort everyone thought impossible, and brought loss to Beim was me. They had stocked up a large amount of equipment, but the majority of that was traded for Magic Stones and materials with Zayin and Lorphys, so the problem was solved.</p><br/><p>But even those actions weren\u2019t by any means a serious blow to the city. Because Beim had the power to retake their losses at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><br/><p>In the corner of Fidel-san\u2019s eye, as he talked with another merchant, I grasped Vera\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>He continued chatting amiably, but seeing his behavior, the Third burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u300eHe\u2019s taking glances this way! He\u2019s definitely mindful of us!\u300f</p><br/><p>While I was provoking the surroundings, and enjoying the party, a merchant-esque young man approached with a smile. I had seen the young man, who gave off a refreshing vibe, somewhere. He looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t the Holy Knight. I\u2019ve heard of your performance in this time\u2019s defensive war. Did my house\u2019s support prove of any help?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was one related to a House that backed us. Son, and heir. No wonder I had seen his face somewhere before, I thought, as I returned the smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Because of it, we were able to attain victory. You have my thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>I earnestly gave my gratitude.</p><br/><p>After that, he went into some idle banter, keeping watchful of his surroundings. Meaning\u2026</p><br/><p>(My house properly supported the victor, he wants to show off.)</p><br/><p>But the ancestors wouldn\u2019t let this chance slip by.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, grab Vera-chan\u2019s hand in a way this youth can see! Grab it like a lover. With your palms held together!\u300f</p><br/><p>I abided the orders of the excited woman, gripping Vera\u2019s hand as per instruction. When I wondered what she had in mind, the young man looked between me and Vera.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, it looks like I\u2019m in the way here. My apologies. Do you get along well with the Tr\u0113s House\u2019s young miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the youth asked that, the Fifth let his voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eOh, looks like it\u2019s time for Father-in-Law\u2019s entrance.\u300f</p><br/><p>The one who raised a laughing voice, as he stretched and came our way, was Fidel-san. He had been watching us, and couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Either that, or he finally managed to slip away from the party participants that had gathered around him.</p><br/><p>Coming up to us\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cVera, it\u2019s fine and all to introduce your friends, but aren\u2019t you getting a bit too close?\u201d</p><br/><p>To his daughter with a smile. And to me with a smile and cold eyes. I offered my greetings.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, father-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Fidel-san stepped on my foot in a way no one around could see.</p><br/><p>The Seventh in the Jewel shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u300eBastard! What are you doing to Lyle!? This isn\u2019t going to end with simple riling!\u300f</p><br/><p>Being stepped on did hurt some, but it wasn\u2019t something I couldn\u2019t endure. The young man, sensed the atmosphere, and took his leave with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fidel-san spoke in a low voice so no one else could hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat\u2026 don\u2019t get in over yourself. I can crush one like you underfoot whenever I want. Just like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>He started putting power into his foot, but suddenly broke into a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>Looking down, I saw Vera\u2019s heel was pushing into Fidel-san\u2019s shoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cV-Vera\u2026 you\u2019re hurting your father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching him maintain his expression, I thought, as expected of him. Vera was smiling as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about moving that foot of yours? And if you\u2019re crushing Lyle, that means making an enemy of me as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Removing his foot from me, he freed himself of the heel piercing into his own. An impression was left on his leather shoes.</p><br/><p>\u201cVera, you\u2019ve got to rethink it. This guy\u2019s no good. I can\u2019t forgive him as a man. In the first place, he\u2019s the sort of guy who lives in a mansion surrounded by over ten other women. Just what do you like about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the party hall, I wasn\u2019t the only one attracting stares anymore. Those around were curious of my relation with the Tr\u0113s House, as I felt some fleeting glances being directed at us.</p><br/><p>There, someone who seemed to be a Guild executive made his appearance. But not of the headquarters, likely from one of the branches.</p><br/><p>He looked over us.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t Fidel-dono. Were you an acquaintance of Lyle-dono?\u201d</p><br/><p>I could understand he was being wary. With the Skills\u2026 All, Search\u2026 I could feel the vigilance of his guards, and while they were hiding it, the hostility they directed.</p><br/><p>Making sure they could see it, I subtly showed off my hand linked with Vera\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019ve aided us greatly this time as well. The fact we could win was only possible because of the Tr\u0113s House, I say.\u201d</p><br/><p>I purposely emphasized the \u2018as well\u2019, as I sent a glance at Fidel-san. I didn\u2019t know if he was annoyed at it, but his expression didn\u2019t fall apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a pleasure to hear you say it. By the way, I hear it\u2019s been quite an ordeal at the South Branch, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on Fidel-san\u2019s words, the other party was part of the South Branch\u2019s management.</p><br/><p>(The South Branch was the one specializing in mercenary brigades.)</p><br/><p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we hire mercenaries, but don\u2019t get the results, there\u2019s little to be earned. We were enthusiastic about slaying a large force of monsters this time, but someone got in our way, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>His reaction flickered from yellow to red for an instant. I looked at him with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s unfortunate. If you didn\u2019t stay holed up here, and dropped by the fortress, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have made a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 I provoked him. A cold sweat was breaking out on my back, but the one who recommended it was, naturally enough, the ancestors.</p><br/><p>The Seventh was especially on board.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, give it to him straight. That if you\u2019re too much a coward, it\u2019s only natural you don\u2019t make money. While you\u2019re at it, tell him to do a better job of concealing his malice. And finally\u2026 rile him up! Rile him up more!\u300f</p><br/><p>In regards to the executive charged with getting the mercenaries together, the Seventh was especially strong-willed.</p><br/><p>At a voice level he could hear\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should really work on hiding your malice there. And your guard beside you has been acting much too mindful of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that with a smile, the South Branch executive\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what you could be talking about. Could it be you\u2019re tired out from battle? Then instead of showing up in a place like this, shouldn\u2019t you be getting some rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Something of that extent wouldn\u2019t work anyone up. While his surface expression was smoothed over, I could tell my opponent was holding back. With the Sixth\u2019s Skill Search, the South Branch executive\u2019s guards had turned bright red.</p><br/><p>Other than them, there were quite a few who were now directing hostility at me.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Why did I come here again? It\u2019s definitely strange to attend if all I really wanted to do was rile everyone up.)</p><br/><p>Until the party ended, I pretended to enjoy its events with Vera.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>I had headed back for the mansion, when Old Letarta\u2019s grandson \u3010Gols\u3011barged in early in the morning, and cried out.</p><br/><p>In front of the large storehouse in the mansion\u2019s yard, he appealed to Old Letarta in tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease come back, grandpa! An order came in from the Tr\u0113s Hous for twelve whole cannons! We\u2019re all worn out, yet they\u2019re telling us to hurry! What\u2019s more, guns as well. We\u2019ll never make it in time!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems the equipment I left at the fortress was bringing trouble to Letarta\u2019s smithery. Emerging in a tank top, perhaps he had been brushing his teeth, as old Letarta had a cup and brush in his hands.</p><br/><p>But with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but the time has come for me to live by my hobbies. To be blunt, the time has come for me to toss all my responsibility\u2026 no, I mean to leave the shop to my stepson. So go tell the lad. \u2018It\u2019s already your generation\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a radiant smile. Honestly, throwing all his work to his stepson, and living by his hobbies\u2026 even for an amazing craftsman, how cruel.</p><br/><p>I watched the scene from a window on the first floor, and Gols yelled again. There was a wooden crate by his side, and it seems he had brought some sort of parcel along.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, Grandpa! You just said toss all responsibility, didn\u2019t you! I\u2019m begging you, come back! We really won\u2019t finish in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Letarta happily stuck up his thumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best. Having work to do is a good thing. And such an environment is just what you need to polish your skills, so it\u2019ll all work out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGramps! It\u2019s because you took on a strange request that it came to this! Can\u2019t you at least tell the Tr\u0113s House head to do something about the date he set!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching him on the verge of tears, I thought I had done a bad thing. But even seeing his grandson like that, old Letarta seemed more interested in the contents of the crate.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gols also sent his gaze at the wooden crate. After letting out a sigh, he opened it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI serviced the Katanas he returned. And I also brought some new ones I made. And wait, do I really have to continue this request? There\u2019s a mountain of work to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Letarta took a katana from the crate, drew it, closed one eye, and inspected it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, looks better than the last ones you made. Well, it\u2019s good to be devoted to a task for a while. I\u2019ll put in a word to that Fidel whelp. But this is definitely completely different from a Sabre.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems he didn\u2019t believe Monica\u2019s words that it was similar enough.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m begging you. Rather, I don\u2019t have any time left to spare, so making more is impossible, I tell you. Could you talk to the requester too?</p><br/><p>When Gols finished his business, he left the mansion. Noticing me watching, Letarta beckoned me out.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Accepting the serviced Katanas I used in battle, and the new ones, I tested their feel.</p><br/><p>The new Katana\u2019s blade was made shorter, making it easier to swing around.</p><br/><p>I tried swinging it in the yard. The handle was finally modified for two-handed use, making it easier to handle.</p><br/><p>Watching my actions, old Letarta took a memo of the points that caught his attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was made just per that young lady\u2019s instructions, but this is an easy weapon to break. Even with rare metal, using magic iron is completely useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>My audience as I practiced with the Katana included Damien as well.</p><br/><p>He came out of the storehouse, tended to by the maids, and looked in my directions. Rather than the Katana, he had something to ask in regards to the Valkyries.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, it\u2019s about those three units. Their maintenance is surprisingly troublesome. From next time onwards, I plan to simplify and mass produce, but do you have any requests?\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe Damien wanted the data he could get from the Valkyrie series, as he was quite proactive on the project. In truth, the Valkyrie development was a large step forward in his research.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then could you contain the Mana consumption? If there are too many of them, the Mana drain isn\u2019t something to make light of.</p><br/><p>There, Damien put his hand to his chin in thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, they\u2019ll need to be supplied through different means. Just where on their bodies could I put a device like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, old Letarta offered his take.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t it just be external?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them burst into laughter, before returning to the storehouse together. It seems a new idea had been born. They went right to work.</p><br/><p>I saw off the backs of the three automatons following them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Letarta\u2019s started living here as if it were natural.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said.</p><br/><p>Scratching my head in the empty yard, I looked up at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess I should go ask some things in the Jewel today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>I entered my own room of memories. As always, Milleia-san came along.</p><br/><p>I went to meet with Septem, but this time the metropolis was in considerable ruin. Walking down the street, the thin and weakened people leaned and sat against the walls of the buildings.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san walked up front, a I winced at the sights even worse than the last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did it come to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew the reason. And while I knew it would happen, I hadn\u2019t even imagined it would be as bad as this. Couldn\u2019t they have done something before it all came to this? I couldn\u2019t help but wonder.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s because Septem-sama was supporting everything alone. She tried raising up magician apprentices, but they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to serve the people as devotedly as she. Eventually, they chose to abandon the people who could never bring themselves to do anything, and disappeared.\u300f</p><br/><p>And those that had learned magic brought their techniques to other lands. Milleia-san said it was the start of the nobility.</p><br/><p>\u300eLike that, the magicians who attained magic took this city\u2019s tale as a warning, and established their own knowledge. Leaving descendants with more proficient ones each generation, they polished their magic tech as much as they could\u2026 a new ruling class came onto the stage.\u300f</p><br/><p>It was the start of us nobles. The nobles up to then hadn\u2019t been definite magicians, but this brought about the phenomenon that magic itself was the proof of nobility.</p><br/><p>Septem-san\u2019s mansion had rotted away, and a portion of the roof had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Walking through its halls, I could see the sky, covered by a gray sheet of clouds.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eAmong the generations of Septem-samas, she was a powerful one. Too powerful. And too kind to an extent she ruined everything. She birthed the result of a more advanced form of magic spreading through the continent.\u300f</p><br/><p>When we entered Septem-san\u2019s room, the bed had rotten through, and a Septem-san that wasn\u2019t an old woman was sitting in a chair.</p><br/><p>A young girl sat, noticed us, and called out. The air she gave off was definitely Septem-san\u2019s. But her voice was still young.</p><br/><p>\u300eOh my, you truly do have the worst timing. A little longer, and it would have looped back to the village.\u300f</p><br/><p>When Septem-san said that, I gave a bitter smile. And\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat could it be?\u300f</p><br/><p>I asked what had been on my mind for a while. It was how Septem\u2026 how Agrissa was defeated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree hundred years ago, Agrissa was defeated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eShe sure was.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the method used to defeat her was never recorded. In order to stop Celes, we can\u2019t help but want to know the means used to defeat Agrissa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing my serious expression, the young Septem-san made a bit of a troubled face. Did she think we wouldn\u2019t be able to do it ourselves? When I thought that, she opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m sorry, but Agrissa could create Skills. And the body to use them as well. I can\u2019t even imagine what sorts of Skills she held. Maybe she could handle everything\u2026 but\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>But\u2026 with those words, Septem-san stood from her seat, and stood before me.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re the same, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Septem-san smiled. She smiled, and spoke of how much a wonder my very existence was.</p><br/><p>\u300eYour ancestors all held the blue jewel, and passed down their Skills. Over their lives, their bodies changed to specialize in Support Class Skills. Having inherited it all, in a sense, it\u2019s only natural that your body excels in using Support Skills.\u300f</p><br/><p>Because of the gem the First bought at a discount, it became easy for we of the Walt House to manifest Support Class Skills, and to make them more powerful.</p><br/><p>Generation over generation, a bloodline polished to support\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, your Experience, and Connection are Skills that didn\u2019t originally exist. They appear completely different, yet they share a common point. What you who was always stolen from would seek out, Experience\u2026 a Skill to let you gain much more experience\u2026 meaning to build up strength for the distant \u3010Future\u3011. Connection allows many to share their experience of the \u3010Present\u3011. Even I can\u2019t tell what your Third Stage will be, but I\u2019m sure it should be linked to the \u3010Past\u3011.\u300f</p><br/><p>I thought my Skills were all over the place without a common point. But it seems they had the same base of experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt kinda seems strange that the past is the last one. Wouldn\u2019t it have been better the other way around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Septem-san laughed.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. But the current you already has the knowledge and experience of your ancestors of the past in your hands, and you\u2019re dealing with their weapons in the present. What\u2019s more, you\u2019re trying to obtain the future. The opposite of your Skill. If you do plan to win against Celes, perhaps your own Skill will be the key.\u300f</p><br/><p>I thought a little.</p><br/><p>If My Skill was one that didn\u2019t originally exist, then even Agrissa and Celes shouldn\u2019t have knowledge of it. It truly might be an important key for victory.</p><br/><p>There, Milleia-san hit against her shoulders.</p><br/><p>Turning, I saw Milleia-san was staring at Septem-san. And when I looked back at her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 It seems the Jewel believes this is the end of what I\u2019m to tell you.\u300f</p><br/><p>Septem-san was wrapped in light. The surrounding scene dissolved into grains of gold, disappearing as if blown away by the wing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Hey! I still have things I want to ask!\u201d</p><br/><p>Septem-san shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u300eThen ask the next person. And\u2026 while my words are uncertain, the Jewel knows the truth. It seems it just wasn\u2019t my role to tell you those answers.\u300f</p><br/><p>Still with a smile, Septem-san faded to golden grains, and disappeared. I reached out my hand, but couldn\u2019t touch anything.</p><br/><p>But I could hear her voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s alright. The next person will teach you\u2026 do your best, descendent of mine.\u300f</p><br/><p>I heard her laugh to herself, as in my daze, I found myself in the round table meeting room before I had even realized it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I see, so I carried Septem-san\u2019s blood as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was natural, but I had forgotten that truth. That Celes inherited the memories of Septem meant that Septem-san\u2019s blood flowed through my veins as well.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san was a little amazed.</p><br/><p>\u300eGood grief, you didn\u2019t even notice that?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cBut when I\u2019m usually talking with the ancestors, I get the feeling, ah, so I really am descended from these guys\u2026 to put it the other way, I couldn\u2019t really imagine anyone else in that role.\u201d</p><br/><p>Milleia-san spoke to me kindly.</p><br/><p>\u300eUp to your birth, it only natural that many people were involved. It wasn\u2019t just the Walt House. The clans of their wives are all part of it as well. Even without direct relations, many gears of fate turned for you to exist.\u300f</p><br/><p>At first it had sounded outrageous, but now I noticed it was only natural.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just me. All humans were like that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019d never really thought about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eRight? Now then, I wonder what the next person will be like. I hope they\u2019ll be fun.\u300f</p><br/><p>From her tone of voice, it seems Milleia-san already knew.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Come to think of it, this person was so carefree I\u2019ve forgotten it lately, but she was the Jewel\u2019s guide, was she?)</p><br/><p>This time, Septem-san taught me a lot.</p><br/><p>About magic. About Skills. About goddesses.</p><br/><p>And\u2026 About Novem as well.</p><br/><p>The fact that I have fate with the goddesses could be because I carry Septem-san\u2019s blood, couldn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>And the gem the Walt House just happened to buy, made a body specialized in the use of Support Class Skills. I got to learn about that.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 That may be one of the reasons for the ancestors potent array of Skills. In that case, gems will get a new value on the market.)</p><br/><p>I had quite a lot to think about, but it wasn\u2019t going to come together at once. I turned back to the round table, to find the ancestors looking my way.</p><br/><p>The Third spoke in his usual smile.</p><br/><p>\u300eWere there any developments?\u300f</p><br/><p>He asked me. The Fourth removed his glasses, and wiped off the lenses.</p><br/><p>\u300eBy your current disposition, I\u2019m to assume the plug\u2019s been pulled on your conversations with Septem. Now then, how about you let us hear it too?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth looked as uninterested as ever, but when he looked at me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, just talk about it. It\u2019ll be much easier than holing it up in yourself.\u300f</p><br/><p>Or so he said. These days, I\u2019ve come to understand the Fifth just a little more. His usual uninterested air was a something similar to hiding his embarrassment.</p><br/><p>The Seventh turned his gaze from me to Milleia-san.</p><br/><p>\u300eCome to think of it, aunty was supposed to be a guide, for argument\u2019s sake. She kept getting rowdy with the Third, so I had forgotten. The terrible nature of two personalities attracts\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>He spoke ill of Milleia-san with a smile, but he never got to finish those words.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san who was supposed to be beside me pounded her fist into his face with a smile.</p><br/><p>Just when did she move? And surprisingly, Milleia-san began to look quite powerful in my eyes. Her frail impression was blown away\u2026 no, I never had such an impression to start with.</p><br/><p>\u300eOh, Brod you trouble-maker. You\u2019re making your big sister Milleia angry. Even when you used to be so cute.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh held his nose.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ve forgotten that past.\u300f</p><br/><p>He said.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san looked a little fed-up as she shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u300eSame as always, I see. Well, as my brother\u2019s son, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got quite a few harsh memories.\u300f</p><br/><p>It seems the Seventh was holding in a bit. I never felt anything like that while he was alive. But within the Jewel, he said quite a few things that caught my interest.</p><br/><p>He seemed to have something towards the Sixth that had morphed into stubbornness.</p><br/><p>There, Milleia-san looked at the Fifth\u2019s face. When the Fifth noticed her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eFather, since you\u2019re here, show Lyle your memory. See, there\u2019s still an important portion you haven\u2019t shown him, right?\u300f</p><br/><p>After making a blatantly reluctant face, he refused in all seriousness.</p><br/><p>\u300eI refuse. In the first place, my memories are irrelevant to the boy. For now, we should prioritize efficiency.\u300f</p><br/><p>Milleia-san spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u300eI think it\u2019s important. It\u2019s something Lyle will need from here on, and more than anything, you do feel some responsibility, don\u2019t you? That when up to your point, the Walt House had aimed for a warm household, but you crushed it all in your generation.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth stood, and returned to his room of memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eI made him angry.\u300f</p><br/><p>She stuck out her tongue a bit, and closed one eye as she said that, but her expression was just a bit sorrowful.</p><br/><p>The Fourth looked curious. More than that, it seems he had an idea of what it was.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing to reveal the secrets someone\u2019s trying to hide. Even so, do you want Lyle to know?\u300f</p><br/><p>Milleia-san nodded. After nodding, she sent a look to the Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026. In Beim\u2019s neighboring land, an army of Bahnseim marched.</p><br/><p>The knights that entered the capital destroyed by monsters dispersed, and began eliminating the remaining monsters.</p><br/><p>The land they had newly acquired was to become a land under direct Bahnseimian control. Eventually, perhaps someone would be awarded the territory as a reward for their achievements.</p><br/><p>Within all of that, a report came to the general, who\u2019s made a base out of a building that was still useable.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral. According to the scouts who went out in Beim\u2019s direction, Beim is still safe. They turned one of their important points to a fortress, and managed to hold back the monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the general laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell isn\u2019t that amazing? As expected, Beim didn\u2019t fall. Well, having them fall would be troublesome. If we had to march and reclaim that far, my bones would break. Also, we still have commerce with them, so having them fall will be a pain in various ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle aged general sat in his chair, finishing up his mountain of paperwork with a grin. The knight who reported seemed quite curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral, this times soldier dispatch seemed considerably content.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, the general looked at the knight\u2019s face before nodded. His probing eyes did bother the knight, but the general stopped his working hands, stood from his seat, and looked out the window.</p><br/><p>Out there, the scene of the city destroyed by monsters unfolded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a job anyone would hate to do. But if it\u2019s a job that lets me get away from the center of it, then I\u2019m thankful. You\u2019re not from Centralle, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the general\u2019s words, the knight nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I was raised in a village a little away from Centralle. It was declared that this time\u2019s expedition wouldn\u2019t be using Centralle\u2019s knights, so we were kinda scraped together.\u201d</p><br/><p>After laughing a little, the general.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I had them do. I sought out subordinates as unrelated to Centralle and the current royal faction as I could.\u201d</p><br/><p>The knight tilted his head. Thinking he didn\u2019t understand, the general gave a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour response troubles me. But just know I wanted subordinates like that. Stay in Centralle, and you\u2019ll get to think that way whether you like it or not. Now then, back to work. When I\u2019m not in Centralle, everything just feels nice and easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still holding questions towards the generals speech and conduct, the knight left the room\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

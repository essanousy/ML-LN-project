The way things were going, Eva\u2019s fabrications would be recognized as truth, and there was a possibility much of their lives would be written off as lies in the world to come.</p><br/><p>So Clara decided to leave records.</p><br/><p>Taking a book she couldn\u2019t reach without a ladder in hand, Clara flipped through the pages. In her separate room in the imperial library, the books of Arumsaas once designated as forbidden had been carried.</p><br/><p>They were mainly documents of the past the Bahnseim monarchy had sealed off.</p><br/><p>There were also things written of the Bahnseim House putting them far from any heroes.</p><br/><p>According to the records of the time, they held a territory quite close to Centralle, and were under Agrissa\u2019s rule for a majority of it. When that standing became disadvantageous, they changed sides, and in the end, they killed Lyle\u2019s ancestor to snatch away all the achievements.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they had frantically tried to erase the facts, as there were traces that many documents were disposed of. At the time, in order to keep the documents safe, Arumsaas had hidden them in a place inaccessible to the public.</p><br/><p>Once the Bahnseim royal line was born, the reason so many countries arose throughout the continent was largely due to their lack of trust towards the House.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only there were more records.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lifting up her staff imbued with light, she continued climbing the ladder as she read through the books on her way when a voice called down from below.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, are you still up there? You should return to the inner palace sometime. Dad is worried for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the boy who called her mom had arrived, she held her books under an arm and climbed down the ladder. Seeing her unsteady descent as she still held a grip on her staff, the young boy worried whether she would fall to the bottom.</p><br/><p>That boy with deep-blue hair was Clara\u2019s son.</p><br/><p>While there was a single Valkyrie Unit beside him, the Valkyrie seemed bored.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have to carry your staff? It\u2019s dangerous so I told you to stop, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Clara reached the floor, she brought her books to the desk and left them there. She leaned her staff against them as well.</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie looked around and arbitrarily began getting things in order.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, leave those books where they are!\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara reached out her hand as she said it, and the young boy grasped her hand. Before she had even realized it, the young boy had grown bigger than her own petite form.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet a grip! It\u2019s because you never come home that I had to come and get you. The librarians were so worried they raised a report to the castle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara- who\u2019d settled into the library- was living a life much more comfortable than she had in Arumsaas. Not only surrounded by books, as long as she stayed here, even food was brought straight to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m properly eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the librarians are being mindful of you. There\u2019s no way anyone can speak out against one of the emperor\u2019s mistresses.\u201d</p><br/><p>To her son\u2019s opinion, Clara tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I get plenty of complaints.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose people are an exception. A special exception. Just give up and return to the inner palace. Did you know\u2026 on the street, they\u2019re calling you the Lord of the Library.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Clara acted bashfully, her son grew irritated, and began adding various gestures to his speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re here, mother! That\u2019s why we have to assign valuable Valkyries to this place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Over a hundred Valkyries. But to speak to the contrary, with the entire continent in his hands, those were all the Valkyries he had.</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie cleaning the area was Clara\u2019s son\u2019s exclusive Valkyrie. There was a single Valkyrie stationed in each of the mansion, meaning the inner palace alone took up twenty five of them.</p><br/><p>They were a valuable asset, but saying that wasn\u2019t enough, another twenty five were stationed around the palace.</p><br/><p>In that case, the number that could move outside were strictly limited.</p><br/><p>Clara looked at her son and let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is quite a difficult problem. When I rise in status, I can no longer do what I want. Come to think of it, have you decided what you want to do? If you want to go independent, even if you try to marry in somewhere, I don\u2019t have any connections, so it will be hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her son was more level-headed than her.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease get a grip on yourself, mom! You\u2019re in Ludmilla-sama\u2019s faction. Talks for my marriage are already proceeding on that side. It\u2019s precisely for that talk that I came to drag you back today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara recalled the inner palace\u2019s factional struggles she had forgotten for quite some time, and hit her hands together.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Come to think of it, Ludmilla-san lost in her war with Miranda-san and has been quiet for a while, has she?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his mother so distant from the events of the inner palace, the young boy held his head. But some part of him seemed to have given up and accepted that his mother was best like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Miranda-san really turned the tables there. No one could have thought she would do something so underhanded\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara remembered the feud in the inner palace back then, folding her arms, and giving a few firm nods.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of the Circry sisters. That was some splendid coordination. I went and evacuated to the library, though. Lyle-s\u2026 his majesty seemed quite worn out after that one. But in order to save face for his majesty, didn\u2019t both side call it a draw?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy confirmed that the Valkyrie had finished cleaning up the room before speaking to Clara.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should think of how worried dad is. Rather, at the point Novem-sama jumped in along the way, and brought the matter to a forced termination, it was Miranda-sama\u2019s victory. Mom\u2026 even if you\u2019re waiting and watching, just go to the inner palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy wanted her to remain neutral like Aria and Vera.</p><br/><p>Clara thought a bit, and looked to her desk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be impossible for a while. I still have work I have to do. I have to leave enough data for the world to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy wearily looked over Clara\u2019s documents.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing to have a hobby, and dad said so too, so I won\u2019t say anything against it. But spend at least the minimum amount of time in the palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie picked Clara up under her arm, and everyone together, the boy left the library.</p><br/><p>Night.</p><br/><p>In the inner palace, Lyle had dropped by the mansion of Clara, who had returned for the first in quite some time.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What\u2019s this? You came because your son scolded you? You and Shannon never change, do you. Her son over there\u2019s a reliable one too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle laughed to himself.</p><br/><p>As he didn\u2019t have to spend the night in the carnivores\u2019 nests today, he welcomed the night with quite a refreshing feeling.</p><br/><p>Clara felt somewhat offended.</p><br/><p>\u201cComparing me to Shannon-san is a bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The most hopeless mistress of the inner palace\u2026 Shannon.</p><br/><p>Her kids were all reliable, to such an extent that Miranda took pity on them, and often looked after them.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Shannon\u2019s children were exceedingly proficient.</p><br/><p>And that only made Shannon\u2019s hopelessness stand out more.</p><br/><p>The boy eating alongside them spoke to Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, about my engagement\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle spoke to his son with a serious look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ve played around enough? Once you marry, you won\u2019t be able to have much fun anymore. Why not stay here a little longer and have your share of fun? See, if you marry into another house, your shoulders will feel cramped. Even when I\u2019m an emperor, my shoulders feel cramped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s children didn\u2019t generally leave the inner palace in their younger years. Being taken out to play, and being scolded alone were done on a consistent basis.</p><br/><p>But the boy spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll obey Ludmilla-sama. Rather, not doing anything for her at all makes me feel bad for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>On her son\u2019s reaction, Clara lamented when she chose to join the faction all those years ago. But back then, it was something she did to keep the balance.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t think that decision was mistaken, and in truth, there was a time when Ludmilla sought after Novem\u2019s position, and caused quite a stir in the inner palace.</p><br/><p>Clara pretended to wait and watch as she purposefully leaked information, and like that she had maintained the peace of the palace. Meaning she had singlehandedly maintained Lyle\u2019s peace.</p><br/><p>Lyle was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Wow, when you\u2019re my son, you\u2019re way too reliable. I should\u2019ve taken you out more often. The more hopeless a child is, the more you can dote on them, see.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he declared he\u2019d take him out and render him hopeless with fun, Monica appeared from under the floorboards and raised her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease leave that role to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hit on the head with a giant hammer from a Valkyrie, Monica was repelled. Lyle restarted his meal.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Well, it\u2019s that. I\u2019ll tell Ludmilla to have some consideration in your treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy offered Lyle his thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. We get along quite well, and Ludmilla-sama said she wouldn\u2019t let anything bad happen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her son even had connections with Ludmilla, Clara mused over how big the boy had grown.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019m definitely a failure as a mother.)</p><br/><p>And she looked at Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cR-really? Well, if I don\u2019t have to go over there, then that\u2019s all the easier for me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If he went to Ludmilla, Miranda would be angry. If he went to Miranda, Ludmilla would be angry. Lyle didn\u2019t get involved with the feuds of the inner palace.</p><br/><p>On the surface and underneath, the intense wars that waged on\u2026 any poor involvement and they\u2019s all blow sky high.</p><br/><p>Her son spoke to Clara.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, making documents is important, but you have to make sure you don\u2019t destroy your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara cleared her throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara was put on the side being worried for. And seeing that, Lyle gave a smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

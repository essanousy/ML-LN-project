We moved quite fast.\u201d (ED: post-town)</p><br/><p>Having arrived in Dalien, I stretched my body and surveyed my surroundings as Novem indicated a sign posted nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a simple map here. The names of establishments are on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>How convenient, I thought as I read over it with her. On it, a building was indicated as the adventurers\u2019 guild.</p><br/><p>Based on the arrangement of the map\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, isn\u2019t it that building over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The building visible from the entrance to Dalien was higher than the two and three story buildings around it.</p><br/><p>Perimeter-wise, it was likely the biggest building as well.</p><br/><p>It looks like Dalien\u2019s adventurers\u2019 guild was raking in quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack home\u2026 no, it\u2019s larger than the branch on House Walt\u2019s territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing me revise my words, Novem looked as if she wanted to say something. Because of that, I forced a smile on my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, we have some time. How about we go register at the guild?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Lyle-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>I held the smiling girl\u2019s travel bag as I walked ahead.</p><br/><p>(Even so, both Zell and Novem said it, but\u2026 Money disappears before you know it.)</p><br/><p>My wallet had gotten considerably lighter.</p><br/><p>Naturally, we purchased quite a bit before we headed here. Our most expensive expenditure was likely the sword. I bought a Sabre, but perhaps because they rarely got requests for the type of blade; the few they stocked had a high price tag.</p><br/><p>(I really have to consider our finances. And those ancestors have a fundamentally different set of values\u2026)</p><br/><p>Values vary by generation, and a sense for money is the same.</p><br/><p>Due to the finances built up over the previous generations, my grandfather the Seventh, the Sixth, and the Fifth generally had a rich man\u2019s mindset.</p><br/><p>The first persisted that a man\u2019s weapon had to be an axe or blunt weapon, and he complained that a sabre wouldn\u2019t be of any use.</p><br/><p>\u300eOtherwise, you could just throw the timber and ricks scattered around, right? If there are none, your hands are more than enough.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026 He truly was the owner of a mindset overflowing with wilderness.</p><br/><p>Walking towards the conspicuous building, we saw other adventurer-esque people heading in the same direction.</p><br/><p>Their outfits were widely varied, but there were some I couldn\u2019t see as anything other than thugs among them.</p><br/><p>They hung knives at their waists, and walked in a way as if to intimidate the passers-by on the street.</p><br/><p>Adventurers usually travel with weapons on hand. The guild manages it, but if you ask if that actually lowers the crime rate among them, that\u2019s apparently not the case.</p><br/><p>I mean, a majority of them are ruffians, or perhaps mercenaries.</p><br/><p>Among them, some simply had yet to get wanted posters issued and were in hiding. The Guild tried to be careful about such things, but by the look of it, it wasn\u2019t going too well.</p><br/><p>In truth, having thirty to forty percent be decent adventurers was considered a good trend. There\u2019s also a large portion of people just acting as adventurers in their spare time.</p><br/><p>(Well\u2026 it\u2019s just something I heard from the ancestors, though\u2026)</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t knowledge of my own.</p><br/><p>I only had a vague understanding of adventurers. But once I knew the true contents of them, I felt like the past me that admired them was a fool.</p><br/><p>In reality, less than ten percent of adventurers were the ones children admire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived, Lyle-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? Why is the Guild\u2019s first floor a market?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the first floor of the building, which was clearly indicated on a large sign as the adventurers\u2019 guild, was a shop-like area supported by pillars.</p><br/><p>Carts and adventurers as well as merchants came and went.</p><br/><p>And there, merchants and adventurers, and people who looked like civilians, were shopping around.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, that\u2019s the venue used for trade. Using the first floor, adventurers can trade in whatever monster parts or other things they brought back with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Really? You don\u2019t hand over whatever you got to the guild?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem gave a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m none too knowledgeable, but going outside, exterminating monsters, and bringing them back is\u2026 really dirtying, right? It\u2019s quite difficult if they all go into the building like that. Look, there\u2019s a bath house next door. If you really have an urgent matter for which you need a receptionist, you go there to remove the filth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, when you think about it, turning over monster materials at the counter was definitely strange. They reek of blood and leave nasty stains.</p><br/><p>The reception desks are probably for paperwork, so it\u2019s normal for them to create another area for this.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-of course. Aha, ahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had resolved myself to work hard, but I was already showing off my ignorant ways. How many times has it been already?</p><br/><p>(Will I really be fine here?)</p><br/><p>With my arms full of anxiety, I headed to the reception desk on the second floor with Novem. We climbed the stairs and heeded the signs to press onwards.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The second floor of the Adventurer\u2019s guild contained the receptions desk, and its counter was really wide.</p><br/><p>A line of staff members dealt with adventurers from one side.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere sure are a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve never been registered before, so I\u2019m a bit nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the Jewel, I heard not the First, but the Second\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat old man\u2019s gotten sulky, so I\u2019ll explain in his place. No wait, I doubt you have to worry about the guild\u2019s registration. They\u2019re quite used to dealing with newbies, I\u2019ll bet.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fine if I just got the Second Generation from the start?\u201d</p><br/><p>To indicate that I understood, I touched the jewel once. While keeping my ears ready for the Second\u2019s voice, I began to consider which line to join.</p><br/><p>Looking at it, there was a clear difference in the lines.</p><br/><p>Are those young ones fresh adventurers? Those guys were lined up at the counter with the beautiful staff member managing it.</p><br/><p>A woman with an amazing smile handled them with a happy expression.</p><br/><p>There was also an aunty who seemed used to the job, and that\u2019s where the adventurers who looked to be in a rush were lined up.</p><br/><p>The number of female staff was relatively high. There were few males on call.</p><br/><p>I was about to step into the older lady\u2019s line, but there, the Second Generation stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, why not just go to the shortest one?\u300f</p><br/><p>(Eh? If it\u2019s the shortest one, then\u2026)</p><br/><p>As I looked for the line the Second was talking about, I saw a brown-skinned, muscular male staff member with red, buzz-cut hair.</p><br/><p>With that appearance, he was quite scary.</p><br/><p>As I hesitated, the Second spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t worry. Among these ones, he\u2019s the most decent.\u300f</p><br/><p>(What part of that appearance is decent?)</p><br/><p>He had removed the overcoat the others wore over their clothes, and I could clearly sense the steel-like muscles under that shirt. If I get him mad, are you sure his fists won\u2019t fly?</p><br/><p>His looks made me think that.</p><br/><p>\u300eOn. With. It! Don\u2019t keep Novem-chan waiting!\u300f</p><br/><p>(Why are the First to Fourth pushing Novem at me? No, I understand she\u2019s the daughter of a family that took care of them all, but\u2026)</p><br/><p>Reluctantly, I headed for the line I was told. There, Novem gave a surprised voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou chose that receptionist? Since it was Lyle-sama, I thought you would go for the one who was processing work quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought too, at first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t say that I still thought that one was better. But Novem looked relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was also going to recommend that receptionist, so it all works out fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems Novem was of the same opinion as the Second.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The way he\u2019s working seems quite courteous, and for people who are aiming for registration like us, it\u2019s best we obtain a polite impression.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, the Second agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eNice. That\u2019s exactly right. Rather than a beauty who did rough work while throwing around a smile, and one who did quick work, that you didn\u2019t know whether she was used to the job or not, you should pick the one who\u2019s, while scary-looking, doing the job with kindness and courtesy. And that beauty over there ain\u2019t happening.\u300f</p><br/><p>It appeared that the Second was against her, so I looked at the beauty\u2019s line.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh~? Lunch is a bit troublesome~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine? Once your work\u2019s over, let\u2019s get something to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still~.\u201d</p><br/><p>She handled it with a smile, but the next person\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, here is your reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cU-um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext in line please.\u201d</p><br/><p>The treatment she gave to the adventurer with a good face and good equipment, and to the one with good equipment, but a normal face, was clearly different.</p><br/><p>Also, the normal-faced one looked troubled.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait! The promised reward sum was different, wasn\u2019t it! The client\u2019s evaluation was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you tell me something like that~.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she gave a bothered face, the adventurers lined up behind acted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy! We\u2019re just as busy here. Don\u2019t make such a fuss over a few copper!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I looked over that, I resolved myself to never, ever, get into that person\u2019s line.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat ain\u2019t happening, right? And wait, she should really be taken off the receptionist line. Though I get the feeling that with that attitude, she wouldn\u2019t work well in the back, either.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second\u2019s evaluation was quite strict.</p><br/><p>Apparently, the beautiful receptionist was popular among newbies and flirtatious adventurers. But, her work ethic was the worst.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t choose there.)</p><br/><p>As I thought something like that, Novem\u2019s voice reached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, you\u2019re up next.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>My turn came around.</p><br/><p>Unlike seeing him from afar, seeing the man up close amplified the destructive power. While it\u2019s true that his body was big, he also had a certain atmosphere.</p><br/><p>It was as if he was a warrior.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis person may have been an adventurer himself. If he started working as a clerk after retiring from that, you should expect some excellent conduct from him. Lyle, start coming to this person from here on.\u300f</p><br/><p>As the second was arbitrarily deciding things on his own, I requested an adventurer\u2019s registration from the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a registration form. Ah, two please.\u201d</p><br/><p>He understood and prepared some blank sheets.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegistration, is it? Well, nice to meet you, I\u2019m known as\u3010Hawkins\u3011. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand, don\u2019t hesitate to ask me. Also, if you\u2019re both registering, how about registering as a party? \u201d</p><br/><p>Party registration? As I tilted my head, Novem responded faster than the Second.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in your care.\u201d</p><br/><p>As opposed to his appearance, Hawkins-san had quite a polite tone. The paperwork began proceeding forwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter registering here, your home guild branch will be set as this one, here in Dalien. When you want to change the center of your activity, please submit a transfer request to the guild. After that, submit an arrival form at your final destination and fill out the paperwork to make that guild your home. Otherwise, even if you can sell monster materials to the guild, you won\u2019t be able to take up requests, so please commit it to mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>I filled out the blank page, and Hawkins checked to see if I had missed anything. Both me and Novem were quite used to this sort of desk work.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d been trained for it back home, and more than anything, there were many things that required my signature back there.</p><br/><p>\u201cSplendid. Then could you please apply some of your blood to these two sheets? Please make use of this needle. Ah, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s been properly disinfected. You as well, miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I used the needle to prick my fingertip. The blood welled up and formed a small ball, before I smeared it on the silver sheet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWonderful. This here works as medicine, so feel free to use it after wiping off the blood. Well then, please write your name on them as well. One of them will be kept by the guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>The silver sheet was something like a guild-issued identification card. Otherwise known as a Guild Card.</p><br/><p>If its owner were ever to die, it was a mysterious item where the name on the card would disappear. It also carried some records of its holder\u2019s actions that the guild could read at their own discretion.</p><br/><p>Hearing that explanation, the Second\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 So when so many years go by, you get something this convenient. My time never had a tool like that, you know? And wait, isn\u2019t it an item that would usually have a pricetag on it?\u300f</p><br/><p>It was just as the Second said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your first registration, the cost comes to five silver coins. But if payment seems impossible, then a small commission from your future rewards\u2026 ten to twenty percent of your compensation will be put towards paying the fee. Will that be fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem took out a gold coin.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll pay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Then your Guild Card is being prepared, so please wait on the sofa over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hawkins-san took the sheets over to the door behind the counter. After a short while, he returned, and returned to his reception desk work.</p><br/><p>Novem and I headed for the sofa, and as we sat in it side by side, we began to draw some glances from the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Tongue clicking and envious eyes were directed at me. The reason was clear.</p><br/><p>It was because of the looks of the girl sitting beside me.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as I thought, he was a polite and kind one, Lyle-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem didn\u2019t seem bothered in the slightest. There, the First, who had been quiet up \u2018til now, spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou blockheads! Don\u2019t be throwing such vile glances at Novem-chan, ya\u2019 bastards!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second chimed in.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf you do anything to Novem-chan, Lyle\u2019s going to beat the living daylights out of you!\u300f</p><br/><p>Finally, even the Fourth spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, it\u2019s true that we can\u2019t do anything to them directly from here, but\u2026 doesn\u2019t it just sound pitiful when you say it, you two? And wait, don\u2019t act up so much, please. Lyle\u2019s going to collapse.\u300f</p><br/><p>While letting out the aura of a worldly-wise man, the Fourth shut the other two up. The height of their emotions, and the act of making it so I could hear them, depleted my Mana.</p><br/><p>(To get so tired from doing absolutely nothing\u2026 it\u2019s as if I\u2019ve become diseased.)</p><br/><p>I had never thought of my magic as small before. But from what I hear from the ancestors, I\u2019m quite low on the scale.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, these are your Guild Cards. You\u2019ve already been registered as a party, so you\u2019ve had each other\u2019s\u2019 names carved into your cards.\u201d</p><br/><p>The card Hawkins-san handed over had my name carved in large letters onto it. And in small letters, Novem\u2019s was there as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere is the pamphlet of the guild\u2019s terms and conditions. We\u2019re not offering any training today, but tomorrow morning, in the third floor\u2019s meeting room, there\u2019s a short course geared towards novice adventurers, so if you have the time, please drop by.\u201d</p><br/><p>He highly recommended us to take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the thorough explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem offered her thanks, Hawkins-san stared at us, slightly lost in thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried asking, but he returned a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s rare to find new adventurers who aren\u2019t scared of me, so I unintentionally\u2026 Also, this is just my personal opinion, but\u2026 you two, if you have the economic leisure, how about you hire an advisor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn advisor?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Novem\u2019s response, Hawkins-san began explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. A guild-certified excellent adventurer, for a few months\u2026 the usual period being three. For that time, you hire the advising adventurer as a client. There are numerous types of contracts, but you could pay with a percentage of your rewards, or pay a lump sum upfront.\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on the payment method, the quality of hired adventurer is subject to change, it seems.</p><br/><p>Paying with a cut of your own wages gave you a lower-middle class one at best. But by paying it upfront, an intermediate leve adventurer\u2026 or perhaps even an upper level one would take on the job.</p><br/><p>In exchange, the cost was a whopping ten gold.</p><br/><p>(No, we don\u2019t have that sort of money.)</p><br/><p>Thinking that, I was about to ask Novem if she wanted to hire one on commission, however\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll pay upfront, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh? Upfront, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem produced ten golden coins from her purse. As Hawkins-san accepted it, he had quite a nervous expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Having said that, he probably expected us to choose the percent based option.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Novem!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I tried to stop her, she began explaining with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, we\u2019ll be able to receive guidance from one the adventurers\u2019 guild recognizes as a skilled adventurer. We should treasure this opportunity. Especially since it seems that we don\u2019t have a great enough understanding of what it is an adventurer is.\u201d</p><br/><p>I do think Novem\u2019s opinion is correct, but I\u2019m more shocked that she paid out ten gold coins at the drop of a hat.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s much too different from me, who was thrown out penniless, and who only had money borrowed from a servant.</p><br/><p>Hawkins-san asks for confirmation once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you will be paying a lump sum of ten gold coins. Is that correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll leave it to you. Please get us an excellent advisor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. If they turn out not to your liking, we\u2019re willing to refund the money you paid.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to have some confidence, but still, the conversation seemed to be proceeding without my input for quite a while.</p><br/><p>And</p><br/><p>\u300eHey man\u2026 looking from the side-lines, you look quite useless right now, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second Generation\u2019s words were quite heavy on my heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

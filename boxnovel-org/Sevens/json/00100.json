I hope she stays well.)</p><br/><p>We were barely able to converse at the time of parting.</p><br/><p>Because she had been much too sorrowful for that.</p><br/><p>I heard the Thirds voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, by the time you return, I\u2019m sure\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>(I know.)</p><br/><p>As I continued paying mind to nothing but the scenery behind us, Eva called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Just looking out at the imperial capital. I\u2019m making an oath to myself to return someday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I went and took my seat, and Eva sat beside me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm~ then I guess that\u2019s fine\u2026 right! Before I join in on all this, let me hear the story. The tales of the supporting cast are important as well, and learning some more will let me put more emotion into my song!\u201d</p><br/><p>To her full-on grin, I directed some cynicism.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that interesting a tale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Even when you only experienced your first Growth in Dalien, you kissed an Automaton to life in Arumsaas, and you swindled a noble out of his money in Centralle? Look, I already know that much, so what harm is there in telling me the rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho spread all of that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone did!\u201d</p><br/><p>I put Eva and her smile aside, to look at the other members of my party seated around.</p><br/><p>Monica waved her hand at me with a grin. Aria\u2019s shoulders were shaking ever-so-slightly.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s laughing. She\u2019s desperately trying to hold it in.</p><br/><p>Novem looked a little apologetic, and Clara hid her face behind her book.</p><br/><p>Miranda blew me a kiss, and Shannon was blatantly chuckling to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are the worst! Why divulge that of all things!?\u201d</p><br/><p>On my words, Aria spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make such a fuss. Eva said something about having to know this and that if we were going to be comrades. See, some of your actions were so strong that it just kinda slipped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t just play it off as slipping!</p><br/><p>Eva was happily taking memos.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, this isn\u2019t going to show up in the song, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? No, I haven\u2019t the slightest. For now I\u2019ll just see it through to the end, and it all depends on how I determine its importance. That being the case\u2026 how about you tell me the tale of Lyle known to no other. To me alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>With those final words, she grinned at Aria.</p><br/><p>(Meaning, she\u2019s pretty much threatening me to include all that in her song if I don\u2019t talk\u2026)</p><br/><p>Everyone made irritated expressions all of a sudden, but Novem alone looked a little triumphant.</p><br/><p>As my childhood friend of sorts, Novem knew more of my younger days.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow underhanded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll at least go this far. Now just say it already. Out. With. It!\u201d</p><br/><p>On her urging, I thought a little.</p><br/><p>And if she was going to sing of it anyways, then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak, but before that, you have to promise me something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? If it\u2019s something like, \u2018even if I tell you, you can\u2019t sing about it,\u2019 I refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite. There\u2019s a story I\u2019d like you to sing of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA story I don\u2019t know? I do consider myself the knowledgeable type, so if it\u2019s one you know of, I think I might as well. Or could it be you\u2019re requesting a composition?\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ancestors of the Walt House. You don\u2019t know them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Confirming she really didn\u2019t know, Eva nodded. But perhaps her interest wasn\u2019t piqued, as she showed some clear disapproval.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose sorts of stories usually have lots of exaggerations tacked on. There are quite a few who ask for the stories of their predecessors turned to song. In order to make their houses look bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave a sincere smile, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019ll bet. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll only be telling you the good stuff about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Eva nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat so? Then tell it as it is. What sort of ancestors did you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are seven of them, but let\u2019s see\u2026 how about I go in order?\u201d</p><br/><p>And so I told the tale of our founder.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>The Third was quite vexed.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow about the matter of Lyle turning our lives tales to song.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth nonchalantly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eDoes it really matter?\u300f</p><br/><p>To a man who didn\u2019t seem to understand, the Third yelled.</p><br/><p>\u300eBased on how Lyle feels, our stories will be set in history\u2019s stone for years to pass! It\u2019ll be the worst if something strange is tacked on! As if you can understand the feelings of a man who\u2019s supposed to have died a man of valor!\u300f</p><br/><p>Holding his head in both hands, the Third flailed about. Those around looked at his with fed-up expressions.</p><br/><p>Letting out a sigh, the Fourth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then, how about we get some other opinions?\u300f</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t really mind that Lyle had chosen to fight Celes.</p><br/><p>But his method of doing so was- as of yet- unclear.</p><br/><p>The Fifth put some sound argumentation to mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300eAnd wait, if we don\u2019t know the present situation, then saying we\u2019ll make countermeasures is\u2026 like how other countries are faring, and their relations to Bahnseim, there\u2019s quite a bit.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eWell all they can do for now, is collect information, as they increase their capital and train themselves, I guess.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300eTo go up against Celes herself, they\u2019ll require an elite female force of those resistant to her influence.\u300f</p><br/><p>Gather soldiers to make an army.</p><br/><p>Perhaps create a large mercenary organization, and use that to challenge Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>With assassination, even if he won, Lyle would lose his chance to stand on the front stage.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf there\u2019s nothing to do for now but sharpen the few soldiers they have at present, then the problem to consider is just what sort of victory they\u2019re aiming for.\u300f</p><br/><p>After winning, what did Lyle plan to do?</p><br/><p>If played poorly, all that was left would be for him to be offed himself.</p><br/><p>Of all else, Lyle was of the same Walt House as Celes.</p><br/><p>The one who, of the five ancestors remaining, had come out with the highest standing, the Seventh, gave his forecast.</p><br/><p>\u300eFirst of all, whether Lyle will be standing at the head or not is essential. If he leads the charge and decides to retire afterwards, the country will divide into warring states, I\u2019ll bet. If he plans to put someone up on the pedestal, they\u2019ll have to be someone with enough charisma and ability to govern a large nation.\u300f</p><br/><p>How would Lyle go about it.</p><br/><p>It was yet another factor that would affect it all.</p><br/><p>The Sixth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eIn the worst case scenario, even after victory, dissatisfaction towards the boy would grow, and that brings us to assassination\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Displeased, the Fifth looked up at the ceiling, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eBut Hoisting up someone else is also a pain. There\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll never be charmed by Celes along the way. Even if they be of the same gender as her, do you think Behnseim would accept a queen after being put through hell by Celes?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth brought it all together.</p><br/><p>\u300eFor now, how about we get Lyle and co. enough ability to put up a fight. Well, as they are now, they won\u2019t be able to get a stage to fight yet.\u300f</p><br/><p>There was a mountain load of problems.</p><br/><p>But it was all based on Lyle\u2019s decisions.</p><br/><p>The Fifth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eWe\u2019ll have to train Lyle as well. If we just teach him nothing but our Skills as we\u2019ve been doing up to now, I can\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever defeat Celes. Someone here will have to personally train his abilities.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth nodded, and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Meaning\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third suddenly cut into the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe strongest one among us should be the one to do it. So\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat would be me.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll bet it\u2019s me.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou mean me?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eTotally my turn.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYep, that\u2019s me.\u300f</p><br/><p>In an instant, silence engulfed the conference room, and everyone stood from their seats with smiles on their faces.</p><br/><p>The Third\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, oy, just how much do you think I\u2019ve fought in my life? How many times do you think that incompetent wreck of a king sent me off to fight?\u300f</p><br/><p>Correcting the positioning of his glasses with a finger, the Fourth smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll be troubled if you think my Skill is for nothing but movement. My apologies to all of you, but I don\u2019t get the feeling I\u2019ll lose to the Third or any other.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth shook his head, a tired expression across his face.</p><br/><p>\u300eHow many times do you think my land was attacked? And through it all I endured, and made a stable foundation. Bandits and soldiers, mercenaries\u2026 how many do you think I crushed?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth laughed at the threats the others tossed out.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m the one who expanded the Walt house, you know. I\u2019m sorry to say it, but I don\u2019t feel I\u2019l even lose to my father, the Fifth.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eTo aid in the recovery of Bahnseim, I crossed countless battlefields. There\u2019s no way a man who experienced something like that would ever be weak. Well, I can understand how my predecessors would like to insist that they were strongest, though.\u300f</p><br/><p>His parched laughter echoed through the room, and with the opening of the Fifth\u2019s mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eCut the crap! A runaway brat should just shut his mouth! You never won out against me to the end!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eBecause I would never go all out against the elderly! You\u2019re still dragging out that runaway stuff\u2026 want to go at it, damn old man!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThink you stand a chance? I\u2019d like it you keep the jokes to a limit, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eMy thoughts exactly. Well, the Fourth was more a civil officer, so I doubt he\u2019d understand the sentiment of us military men.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHa ha ha, so you want to play soldier with those measly medals on your chest? You all seriously think all my fighting was done on a desk? Maybe it\u2019s those na\u00efve thoughts of yours that let Celes get her hands on the Yellow Jewel in the first place.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eNow you\u2019ve said it, damn glasses!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t look down on the glasses!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u300e\u300eI\u2019m the strongest here!!\u300f\u300f\u300f</p><br/><p>And as all in the Jewel were about to burst into chaos, Lyle manifested.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he had nothing to do on the long voyage, as he decided to drop into the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all so worked up about? And wait, you\u2019re speaking so loud I can hear it outside, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before a fed-up Lyle, the Third withheld all he had to say about Eva\u2019s case, and explained the current situation.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo you see, these guys are getting worked up about who\u2019s strongest. You can tell right away, can\u2019t you, Lyle?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh addressed his grandson.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow tell them all about my strength, Lyle. In the first place, we only became able to use magic to its fullest from the Fifth. If you think of how much of a definite form it must have taken by my generation, our difference in skill should be more than clear.\u300f</p><br/><p>Taking some Glances at Lyle\u2019s face, the Seventh tried proving his superiority to the rest.</p><br/><p>But Lyle folded his arms\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd why did things come to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fourth cleared his throat, and explained.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, it\u2019s just we thought the one to train you should be the strongest among us. See, there are quite a few here that seem to misguidedly think that must be them.\u300f</p><br/><p>Surveying the area with a smile, he turned to Lyle and nodded.</p><br/><p>The Sixth as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou can tell, can\u2019t you Lyle\u2026 now how about you tell them who\u2019s the strongest?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth too.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right. You know who\u2019s the strongest, right Lyle?\u300f</p><br/><p>Lyle nodded a few times, and answered with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I just have to beat all of you guys, right? Now isn\u2019t that simple? If all of us fight, the matter should resolve itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The air instantly froze, and the ancestors exchanged glances before moving to surround Lyle.</p><br/><p>The Third places his hand on Lyle\u2019s left shoulder.</p><br/><p>The Fourth stood in front of him.</p><br/><p>The Fifth, his hand on Lyle\u2019s right shoulder.</p><br/><p>The Sixth and Seventh circled around behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eI see. So you thought of us that lightly\u2026 well, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re weaker than Celes. But listen here\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re underestimating us too much, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth put some power into his grip, making Lyle wince.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right. This is a good chance, so how about we teach you a thing or two.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eThen off we go. We\u2019ll train you all together.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Um\u2026 it\u2019s the Seventh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle sought aid from his grandfather, but the man himself only smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t worry. If you get injured here, it fixes itself up in a jiffy. Even if your chest is pierced through, you\u2019ll be unharmed in reality\u2026 Now it\u2019s been a while since I last trained you.\u300f</p><br/><p>He was smiling, but his eyes alone contained no joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s just the result, right! It doesn\u2019t change the fact I\u2019ll be pierced, right! Hey, wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone hoisted up a noisy Lyle. The fourth took the lead, and opened up one of the doors.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou don\u2019t have to worry too much. You\u2019ll just be fighting a little with everyone. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a blast, ahahaha!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cN-Noooooo!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s scream as he was lifted through the threshold was cut off with the closing of the door\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

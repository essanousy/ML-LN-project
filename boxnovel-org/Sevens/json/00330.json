Beyond the lines of armored authorities, the large door at the front opened, and a messenger raced in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMessage! The enemy forces surround Centralle. Their numbers are estimated at six hundred thousand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, those of the Bahnseim Royal line beside Celes were shook up. The others simply listened to the report expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Celes\u2019 mouth warped on the report and she smiled. To her, her husband Rufus spoke anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-hey, Celes. Will we be alright? While we\u2019ve concentrated our troops in Centralle, with the attacks happening across the lands, we haven\u2019t even been able to gather two hundred thousand. I-if we\u2019re to lose, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Celes stood. She turned her face to Rufus.</p><br/><p>\u201cLose? Me? That\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s definitely impossible. I mean, everything up to now has gone just as I expected. No matter how sly an army of the living tries to be, they cannot win against dead men. And our troops don\u2019t only number two hundred thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rufus tilted his head a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Celes\u2026 there are only two hundred thousand soldiers in Centralle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes smiled as she spoke to Rufus.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery single one of the over-a-million citizens of this city are my troops. They\u2019ll all fight for me. I mean, life and death no longer matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Rufus failed to grasp the gist, Celes laughed to herself. And she transported herself straight from the audience chamber. Her guard, the butler Burt in his tailcoat. Rummel whose long black hair dragged along the ground\u2026 taking along her favorites, she headed for the balcony.</p><br/><p>And what Rufus saw as he followed along had gone beyond his imagination.</p><br/><p>Those that filled the plaza were, without a doubt, soldiers. But it wasn\u2019t as if the capital consisted of nothing but able men. There were old men and women only natural for a city to have, and yet those that covered the plaza were nothing but soldiers.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the elderly to babies\u2026 everyone offers their lives to me. That\u2019s why every single civilian in Centralle became a soldier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rufus took a step back in surprise, his back running into something.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Maizel-dono\u2026 no, father-in-law, even mother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maizel and Clair appeared on the Balcony in their full armor. Their empty eyes didn\u2019t take in someone like Rufus at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles, so this is where you were? The supreme commander should be properly preparing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Celes. Quickly come inside. No matter what happens, the two of us will protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>On her parents\u2019 words, Celes turned and send a smile. The skirt of her white dress spread out, swaying in a similar fashion to her golden hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot~ it. But when the battle reaches such a scale, I can\u2019t help but be excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Celes\u2019 innocent smile, Maizel gave a warm smile himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of a daughter of the Walt House. In your veins flows the blood of a feudal noble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clair touched a hand to her face as she tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough I was hoping she\u2019d turn out a bit more graceful. Well, even like this you\u2019re still cute, so you\u2019re fine as you are, Celes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two by her side, a delighted Celes returned to the royal palace. Watching her form from behind, Rufus\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, how reliable you are, Celes.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face flushed, he followed faithfully behind\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cAffix the mobile fortress! Direct the cannons at the gate! Centralle\u2019s wall isn\u2019t going to crumble so easily. Concentrate fire on one point!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moving fortress slowly advanced, and once it stopped, it lowered its base with a thunk, driving stakes into the ground.</p><br/><p>Under the cloudy sky, the fortress stood boldly before the gate of Centralle.</p><br/><p>From the room where decisions were made, Vera issued one order after the next.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because we\u2019ve stopped, don\u2019t let the flame of the motion hearth die down! Tell the workshop that there\u2019s no telling when we\u2019ll move, so they should brace themselves for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was taking a sidelong glance at Vera sitting in her seat and barking out orders, General Blois called over to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, I\u2019m going somewhere it\u2019s easier to take command from as well. Lyle-dono, properly call out to me when the attack begins.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded and gave a light raise of my right hand to respond before looking straight ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, how will our opponent move on the first day?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a large-scale battle.</p><br/><p>Will they suddenly reveal their hand to take us by surprise\u2026</p><br/><p>Monice nearby conveyed a report.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman forms have been confirmed atop the castle ramparts. But they are not showing any reaction from your Skill. They are already dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a flag hoisted on the ramparts, and beyond it they were preparing to intercept. I put a hand to my mouth at this quiet beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How are our siege weapon preparations?\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica responded at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cPreparations are at around seventy percent. But there are some differences in performance among the members of this alliance. There are many armies who have yet to prepare, it seems.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s only natural they\u2019d never experienced a battle of this scale, but the usual level was only on a scale of hundreds. At most, there were countries who\u2019d experienced wars of thousands. I\u2019m sure they were shrinking back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave them hurry up. In the worst case, they can just work on making their stockades as thoughtfully as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>From fighting the armies dispatched from Centralle, I could tell the sort of battle Celes favored. Perhaps from Septem\u2019s\u2026 Agrissa\u2019s influence, she preferred battles that inflicted massive casualties on both sides.</p><br/><p>She conducted battles that didn\u2019t consider expenditure from the start.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Looks like they\u2019re coming out already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the stones thrown by siege weapons and bursts of magic hit, flashy explosions burst forth. While it was a normal beginning, our enemy was so quiet it created an ominous air.</p><br/><p>Monica watched the flying magic bolts explode, obstructed by the ramparts as she opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re opening the front gate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Lyle\u2019s main camp.</p><br/><p>Blois saw the enemy opening the main gate and issued orders around. Around, through the exchanges of magic, the knights and magicians were quite occupied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re firing without paying mind to ally damage. If you cut off your emotions, these dead men really are a convenient force to use. Well, I\u2019d never want one in my ranks\u2026 if they\u2019re only charging straight ahead without thinking of anything else, we have ways to deal with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hurrying the messengers to deliver his orders, Blois looked at the enemy lauching their attack without paying heed to the magic flying back and forth.</p><br/><p>They were even raising a war cry, but it was a sight more ominous than anything.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 An army of the dead. Can\u2019t laugh at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The enemy heading straight for Lyle\u2019s main camp\u2026 ignored the magic coming at them from friend ahd foe as they attacked.</p><br/><p>Head-on, and while putting out casualties from the battery fired from behind them, they continued on without a single look back.</p><br/><p>General Blois covered his face with his right hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true we\u2019re nowhere near them in terms of perseverance. But if they\u2019re just going to charge like that, they fall short of a simple army of monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Lyle\u2019s army showed a movement. It made a large split left and right, inviting the attacking force into its midst.</p><br/><p>The siege weapons stationed in the back began loading barrels of gunpowder to fire. It was one of the plans Lyle had used when he fought the monster army.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they fought like humans, perhaps we would be harder pressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>As General Blois said that, the cavalry approaching before his eyes fell one after the next by trap, they dragged their allies behind them into their fall. But the line before that one tread over their fallen allies to continue their advance.</p><br/><p>It truly was identical to the charge of a monster army.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who thought this one up has a terrible personality. Oil from below, and gunpowder raining from the sky\u2026 on top of that, catching them in a crossfire.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who thought it up was Lyle, but the details were largely finalized with Miranda\u2019s proposals.</p><br/><p>As the attacks crumbled the enemy vanguard, the units that split left and right began their attacks with their bows and guns.</p><br/><p>But looking behind the enemy charge, General Blois let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 If you called their soldier supply unlimited, I may end up believing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching the enemies continue to stream out, he had his allies slowly take distance as they continued on with their strategies\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Baldoir Randbergh led a gun-equipped unit protected by a deployment of stockades.</p><br/><p>Gunpowder wasn\u2019t a problem. Their guns were well maintained. They had enough firearms assembled.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire! Don\u2019t show any mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>While taking their bullets, with their torsos pierced through armor and all, the enemy soldiers who wouldn\u2019t stop their advance.</p><br/><p>The way their blood flowed was peculiar as well. It looked almost as if they weren\u2019t alive.</p><br/><p>The unit nearby Baldoir\u2019s consisted of elves led by Eva. They held up their bows, and aimed their blast arrows\u2026 exploding arrows towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Mountains of arrows came flying, raining down on the enemy unit and exploding\u2026 igniting the oil, enveloping the enemy in a sea of flames.</p><br/><p>Their bodies pierced by arrows, there were numerous enemies who had half their bodies blown away entirely. And yet their advance didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>Even with their lower bodies blown off, the figures of enemy soldiers pulling themselves through the sea of flames with their arms alone could be seen.</p><br/><p>The soldiers were flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this. What the hell is that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaping into the fire on of their own accord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The enemy soldiers who leapt straight into the flaming sea couldn\u2019t be thought of as sane any longer.</p><br/><p>Baldoir wrung out his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t falter! This is the form of our enemy! That\u2019s precisely why we must fight! Don\u2019t let the enemy proceed any further!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were no longer merely charmed by Celes. It could no longer be called a charm, they were being controlled. At Celes who controlled the dead like her dolls, Baldoir felt fear.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 If we don\u2019t fight her here, it truly will become something terrible.)</p><br/><p>While reaffirming Celes\u2019 abnormality, Baldoir issued orders to his men\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 In the palace, Celes sat on the throne as she received the reports.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles-sama, the fifty thousand soldiers that attacked were repelled altogether. They have been thoroughly annihilated.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressionless lines of authorities merely kept that very same position from dawn to dusk. They were truly dolls.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s harsh, I lost fifty thousand on the first day. But that still doesn\u2019t shake our numerical advantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>From Celes\u2019 point of view, the lives of solders were lower than trash. That they revered her just put them a little higher than the other trash.</p><br/><p>There, Maizel stuck in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles, it does seem that thing has made preparations to fight you. You could keep clashing troops to deplete his numbers, but then again, it is a disgrace for you to follow his anticipations.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Maizel\u2019s explanation, Claire continued on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even if his main force is prepared, what of the others? Even if you say they have over six hundred thousand, how many among them seriously intend to fight us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes heard out their opinions with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Then tomorrow, I\u2019ll ignore that damn insect and challenge the others to battle. Even so, the surrounding feudal lords sure are worthless. Since we\u2019re fighting here, they just have to launch an attack from behind. Could it be\u2026 they turned coat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even feeling their betrayal, Celes smiled. And.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t care what becomes of the hostages they entrusted to is? Shall we set an example, and string a few up on the ramparts?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who answered Celes\u2019 laughing voice was Burt. Expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her good mood hindered, Celes glared at Burt. But Burt merely continued on</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no hostages you\u2019ve left alive. They\u2019ve all either been killed and made material for soldiers, or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end of his sights were the monsters keeping docile behind the lined up authorities. While there were a few failures among them, even the successes looked creepy.</p><br/><p>Celes hit her hands together.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right\u2026 I used them for experiments. Hah, preparing corpses at this point and doing this and that would be a pain. Well, once we\u2019re done cleaning up this damn bastard, perhaps I should go off and kill them to kill some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a smile, Celes left the feudal lords aside for the time being, deciding to concentrate on the enemy before her eyes. Lyle had considered attacks from behind, so there was meaning to him going around suppressing the area and freeing them from Celes\u2019 charm.</p><br/><p>To Celes, it was unpleasant that no one was threatening Lyle\u2019s back lines. But unpleasant was all it was.</p><br/><p>Of all else.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you said there were mercenaries who came over to our side, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Burt gave a tidy bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It seems the alliance wouldn\u2019t hire them, so they flowed over to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes twisted her mouth into a grin, so Claire standing to her side cautioned her. As she stuck out her tongue and offered a cute apology, Claire let out a sigh and permitted her actions.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I made her mad. But that means we have ingredients, right? Let\u2019s kill them and make them ingredients for new soldiers. How many people do we have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Burt was about to tell her the precise numbers.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf those that gathered, the numbers capable of battle are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong. I asked you how many we gathered and nothing more. Women, children, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll equally grant them all the glory of becoming my soldiers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Burt gave a, \u2018My apologies\u2019 and went on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this battle that has gathered much attention within Bahnseim, nay, within the continent, a number exceeding fifty thousand have gathered. Those supporting the mercenaries from behind\u2026 I haven\u2019t confirmed their logistic support, but I estimate those are the numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes held up her staff and stood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t that fine? It\u2019s plenty to stand in from what we lost today. The more we fight, the more ingredients for soldiers I\u2019ll get, so that damn trash need only wallow in his despair.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how many times she repeated a pointless and futile offensive, to Celes it was always a loss she could get back on her path to victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow let us enjoy this battle. I want to soon see his face twist in lost hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Celes\u2019 laughing voice resounded through the audience chamber, the authorities who hadn\u2019t moved at all to that point began chanting praise of her. As if they were repeating a set action that had been decided from the start\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Agrissa in the Yellow Jewel watched Celes Laugh.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the Jewel\u2019s throne, folding her legs, she happily watched over the girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdorable Celes, Fight to the death all you with my beloved Lyle. I\u2019ll dote on whoever remains alive. Of course, if I had to say, Lyle\u2019s more to my tastes.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she gave a fascinating Laugh, Agrissa enjoyed watching Celes with her guard so low.</p><br/><p>And she adored Lyle who challenged Celes as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle, it will be quite a sight to see if you can defeat Celes. Even if you have Novem behind you\u2026 it won\u2019t be so easy to take down my protegee. But the moment you surmount her is the moment your existence becomes worthy of my love. I can\u2019t wait to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Agrissa said that and smiled, she heard Celes laugh, and laughed herself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

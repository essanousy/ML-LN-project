It\u2019s subject to change, and I think it\u2019ll vary based on the conditions, but\u2026</p><br/><p>Monica &gt; May &gt; Novem &gt; Aria &gt; Miranda &gt; Eva &gt; Clara &gt; Shannon\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Did the Fifth stray because the Fourth prepared mistresses for him?</p><br/><p>A: Fourth Generation Head (\uff1b[email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cHe was the one who prepared those on his own. He even used my assets to recruit them, right? And wait, he really was a good kid at the start! I\u2019m the one who\u2019s wondering how it came down to this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Head( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cHow about you put your hand to your chest, and ask your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: From the travel distances given, Beim should be around the size of Hokkaido.</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cThis is a fantasy. If I may add, there be monsters in these lands, and some convenient tools have been invented, so real calculations don\u2019t really have a point. It\u2019s a world where monster attacks will often stop movement for a while. That\u2019s usually included when someone says three days. Please look at it like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I want to know the bust sizes of Lyle\u2019s comrades.</p><br/><p>A: Third Generation Head ( \u30fb\u2200\u30fb): \u201cGood question there! By our estimate\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(TL: US size conversion included in parenthesis for clarity\u2019s sake.)</p><br/><p>G (E)\u2026 Novem, Monica</p><br/><p>F (D)\u2026 Eva, May</p><br/><p>E (DD)\u2026 Aria(Retcon), Clara, Miranda</p><br/><p>A (AA)\u2026 Shannon</p><br/><p>Third Generation Head (\u309c\u2200\u309c): \u201cThere seems to be an odd man out, but I\u2019m sure she has some hope for the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>(TL: Because of her tsundere-esque nature, everyone just assumed that Aria was flat, even when stated otherwise. The author eventually just cut her down in the novel release.)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Why won\u2019t Lyle speak up about the Jewel?</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation Head (\u30fb\u0434\u30fb): \u201cThe individual himself says he\u2019s embarrassed, but if you want to look at the root of the problem, then even if he didn\u2019t there wouldn\u2019t really be an issue.. I mean, we\u2019re going to disappear after all. Also, with Celes\u2019 Jewel and so forth, Shannon seemed to understand Lyle\u2019s was a Jewel as well. So what would happen if they knew the past heads wills existed within it? He\u2019d be placed under suspicion, and in all truth, Shannon is suspicious of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Head \u30fd(\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)/: \u201cWell, just hope for what\u2019s to come. As with what happened with me, he may find a chance to speak up about it. I have no interest in anyone besides May, by the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>It would have been interesting if the ancestors\u2019 wives were in it too.</p><br/><p>A: Author: \u201cI want to put in the reason that isn\u2019t possible into an interlude someday. That\u2019s totally not happening right? I\u2019ll write it to give you that impression. I have given thought to it, but if the husbands are like that, then you can expect their wives to be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ancestors (\uff1b \u30fb`\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4) What\u2026 did you say!?: \u201c\u2026 Eh? You\u2019re doing it? No! That\u2019s totally not happening, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: He didn\u2019t even know how to stay at an inn at the start. Lyle\u2019s grown too much. Is that because of his Skill?</p><br/><p>A: Lyle (\u30fb\u0434\u30fb): \u201cHey, wait a second. It\u2019s already been around eight months since I left the house, you know. Normally, you\u2019d get used to it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Poyopoyo sure is cute. Poyopoyo!</p><br/><p>A: Monica \u30fd(\u30fb\u2200\u30fb )\u30ce: \u201cWhy you\u2019ve got some fine eyes on you, dear reader. By the way, it\u2019s Monica\u2026 forget you ever heard that other name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb`): \u201c(And I\u2019m starting to think it doesn\u2019t really make a difference.)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: The Fifth is a lolicon and a furry.</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head (# \u309c\u0414\u309c)snap: \u201cIf you see your beloved daughter in such flashy attire, you\u2019d at least caution the girl! I haven\u2019t the slightest bit of ill intent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sixth Generation Head|\u03c9\u30fb\uff40): \u201cNow let\u2019s direct just a little bit of that sentiment towards your actual children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Isn\u2019t May a little immature for her age?</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head (\u30fb\u0434\u30fb): \u201cWhile there are many that think she should have punished them at once, the quilins are aware that going too far brings danger to their kind. Giving them a fright was about right. I mean, there are some adventurers good enough to take down quilins after all. Would killing them as punishment really be for the best? It was enough to plant a seed of fear in their hearts through threats, and quilins have their own goals to achieve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I want to know the conditions needed to obtain a Skill.</p><br/><p>A: Lyle \u30fd(\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)/: \u201cThere\u2019s no definite to how much Mana you\u2019d need, or what you\u2019d have to do to get it. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way in hell the First would have obtained a Support Skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: hierarchy of power between ancestor and wife.</p><br/><p>A: Fourth Generation Head ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201c\u2026 You can tell by looking, can\u2019t you? By welcoming in such proficient wives, you don\u2019t know how much pain we\u2019ve gone through. The Fifth\u2019s a separate case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: After running away, did the Sixth do some\u2026 bad outside? What I\u2019m trying to say is, did he get some?</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation Head (\uff1b\u309b\u309c\u2019\u03c9\u309c\u2019): \u201cStop! Don\u2019t dig too deeply into it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Head (\uff1b\u30fb\u2200\u30fb) Hah?: \u201cO-oy, could it be you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I can\u2019t see Novem as a proper Yandere\u2026</p><br/><p>A Everyone (\uff1b\u309c\u0414\u309c): \u201cRepeat after me\u2026 NOVEM IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN WITHOUT ANY ULTERIOR MOTIVES.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Does this world have guns?</p><br/><p>A: Seventh Generation Head (\uff40\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cHmhmmm\u2026 the key to that question lies in exactly how I was defeating Lyle within the Jewel\u2026</p><br/><p>!? (I said it! I tried to put on airs, and actually said it!)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Why did May think there were ten Skills within Lyle?</p><br/><p>A: Lyle (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb`): \u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

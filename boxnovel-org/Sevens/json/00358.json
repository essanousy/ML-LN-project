Her brother Lyle would become nine.</p><br/><p>A brother two years older. An eyesore.</p><br/><p>The Weihs territory. The city at its center was one of the prominent cities of the Bahnseim Monarchy. This was a territory the feudal lords of old had poured their lifeblood into completing.</p><br/><p>Even the Walt House once called upstarts now boasted a history of two hundred and fifty years, alongside numerous achievements. They had climbed up all the way to be the most prominent nobles in Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>The Walt House\u2026 Celes Walt was yet another of the influential noble Walt Line.</p><br/><p>The Walt House mansion was busy to celebrate Lyle\u2019s birthday, but that as it was, it was wrapped in a merry air.</p><br/><p>When Celes left her room, she would stick on a smile, and spend her days with it plastered on her face. So not to show what was inside. If she went against her brother, she knew she would simply be hammered down.</p><br/><p>A difference in ability\u2026 even as siblings, there was more than a large wall, or two, or three between Lyle and Celes.</p><br/><p>They both carried the same blood of Septem. They had both awakened to the depths of their blood. And yet her brother Lyle didn\u2019t seem to care about that at all.</p><br/><p>As she looked out the window from her room, a wrinkle graced Celes\u2019s brow. She looked at the people working around the mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How repulsive. Each and everyone one of them, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Placing their expectations on her brother Lyle, and praising her brother Lyle. That was something Celes couldn\u2019t forgive.</p><br/><p>But if she let it show on the outside, she didn\u2019t know what her parents would say. If they did find out, in order protect their heir Lyle, there was a possibility Celes would be sent off elsewhere. In the worst case, perhaps she would spend her life in confinement.</p><br/><p>And that alone Celes wanted to avoid.</p><br/><p>So she endured her hatred and spent every day all smiles and laughs.</p><br/><p>While both of them carried the blood of Septem, as if split into yin and yang, Celes and Lyle were opposites.</p><br/><p>And the more Lyle shined, the darker more did Celes\u2019 shadow become.</p><br/><p>As she let off her rage in the confines of her room, she heard a knock at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles-sama, the master is calling for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the voice of a servant of the mansion, Celes let out a cute, lovable voice. Her expression was a ghastly one, but what left her mouth was lovable beyond measure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming~.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before exiting the room, she changed her expression, and with a smile, she accompanied the servant to her father Maizel.</p><br/><p>Seeing Celes\u2019 smile, the servant seemed joyful. He believed her false smile as the genuine article.</p><br/><p>A truly delighted smile. Celes had no doubts that everyone saw it so.</p><br/><p>(They really do all have knotholes for eyes. Well, I couldn\u2019t care less about that. More importantly, father. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s about my birthday. I wonder what I should ask for.)</p><br/><p>Her beloved parents. While she treated all other humans equally as trash, Celes didn\u2019t want to be hated by her parents alone. She had a strong desire to be loved.</p><br/><p>That was also related to Septem\u2019s blood in her veins.</p><br/><p>The mansion corridor.</p><br/><p>Her talks with Maizel over, Celes walked down the path in good humor. Right now she was alone, but she was so delighted she might\u2019ve broken into dance.</p><br/><p>(Lots of specially-tailored dresses for me. He looked a little troubled, but if it\u2019s father, he\u2019ll definitely grant my wish.)</p><br/><p>When asked what she wanted for her birthday, Celes had asked for a dress. Not just a dress. The footwear and accessories to match. She had asked for multiple full sets.</p><br/><p>Maizel did look troubled, but it seems he did intend to grant the wishes of his adorable daughter. It was that very fact that made Celes more boisterous than any present ever could.</p><br/><p>There, from the other side of the corridor, Lyle came walking.</p><br/><p>Celes\u2019 feelings instantly took a turn to the absolute worst, but even so she stuck on her smile and gave Lyle her greetings.</p><br/><p>(Well, I\u2019m in a good mood today, so I guess I\u2019ll throw in a freebie. This one\u2019s troublesome if you get him angry.)</p><br/><p>\u201cDear brother, are you making for father as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Lyle smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I was called for. I think it\u2019s about your birthday, but\u2026 what\u2019s this, it looks like you really are happy today. You usually give me a much scarier smile, but this one definitely suits you a lot more.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instant, a chill raced down her spine.</p><br/><p>Lyle continued smiling as he continued on and passed her by. He did call out to her, but to the current Celes, it was as if she hadn\u2019t heard anything at all.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That can\u2019t be. It should have been perfect. My smile was perfect\u2026 That one\u2026 he noticed it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Expressionless.</p><br/><p>What assailed Celes was unease, jealousy, hatred, various things were pressed up against her all at once. Her everything had been seen right through.</p><br/><p>As she thought that, Lyle became unbearably scary.</p><br/><p>Yet at the same time that he looked upon her so lightly invited a tempestuous hatred.</p><br/><p>(To me\u2026 you\u2019ve made light of me, Lyle! You trash! Compost! I won\u2019t forgive it. I definitely won\u2019t forgive it!)</p><br/><p>As she walked down the corridor in quick stride, Celes wanted to return to her room at once. In her room she\u2019d cry out, and she had the urge to break something.</p><br/><p>As she walked down the corridor with that on her mind, she found her mother Claire. Stopping in her tracks, Celes hurriedly killed down her feelings and made a smile.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s perfect. My smile is perfect. I\u2019ll definitely be fine.)</p><br/><p>Growing increasingly anxious, she turned her smile to her mother. Claire gave a warm smile back.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles, did you tell Maizel what you wanted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes, mother. I asked for a few dresses.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Claire touched a hand to her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s dresses, you already have some. And we\u2019ve already properly prepared one for you, so you have to wear that one. But you\u2019re a girl after all, Celes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire said it quite troubled, but she didn\u2019t find fault in buying more dresses for Celes. Hearing that, Celes was relieved. To Celes, a reprimand from her parents was akin to despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ve said something selfish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You\u2019re doing your best, Celes. By the way, have you seen Lyle around?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was praised. But right after came the name of Lyle.</p><br/><p>Her mother was looking for Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He was headed for father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Thank you Celes. That child is growing up too, so I want to get this and that together for him. He\u2019ll need a horse and weapon before he turns fifteen. That\u2019s right! Celes, do you want to get a present for Lyle with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA present?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m either getting a horse or armor. Maizel said he wanted to hand over a sabre with his own hands, and he won\u2019t listen to anyone on the matter. So I\u2019ve decided on the horse or the armor. When that time comes, could you be with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Walt House had used a different weapon generation after generation. They were a group with strong characteristics. Perhaps it couldn\u2019t be helped. But Lyle had chosen the same sabre as his father.</p><br/><p>And that was something most joyous for Maizel.</p><br/><p>Celes spoke to Claire with a smile. In truth she wanted to decline, but if she denied her parents\u2019 beloved Lyle, she was scared she would be hated herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes! I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Ah, but you have to keep it a secret. With these sorts of things, I want it to be a surprise when I hand it over. But that boy is way too sharp. I\u2019m worried whether I can surprise him or not. Celes, let\u2019s go out together to buy Lyle\u2019s present next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, Claire made for Maizel and Lyle. Celes saw her off with a smile, but when she was out of sight, she hung her head. There was no one around.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s my birthday\u2026 but they only ever talk about\u2026 I won\u2019t forgive it. I definitely won\u2019t forgive it. I want to take everything from him. It\u2019s all\u2026 it\u2019s all mine. I won\u2019t give a single thing to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes bit her lip.</p><br/><p>But she heard a voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eThose are quite the muddled emotions. But not bad. Not bad at all\u2026 Celes.\u300f</p><br/><p>Celes glared around. The only ones in the mansion allowed to call her without any honorifics were her parents, or so she had decided internally.</p><br/><p>Someone else calling her so was a deed she wouldn\u2019t permit.</p><br/><p>But there was no one around.</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t be so angry. I\u2019m your ally. The feelings you direct at your brother\u2026 I understand them. That\u2019s right. In that case\u2026 I can even help you out if you want.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Who? This isn\u2019t very funny for a prank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s no prank. Let me show you evidence. You remember your grandmother\u2019s room? Right now it\u2019s not being used. Go over there.\u300f</p><br/><p>Irritated as she was Celes headed for her grandmother Zenoire\u2019s room. The voice came from a woman. Fascinating, but be that as it may, it was a voice she had never heard in the mansion before.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it belonged to an assassin. But curiously enough, Celes feet made for the place the voice designated.</p><br/><p>They were connected by something. Celes had noticed the connection.</p><br/><p>And she entered the room. In that room that was cleaned at regular intervals, where the voice led her was under the floor. What\u2019s more, hidden under the bed.</p><br/><p>Celes crawled under the bed, and groped around the floor as instructed to find one portion open up. There were various things inside.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe other things don\u2019t matter. You see a box in there? Right, that one.\u300f</p><br/><p>It was what looked like a music box. It really was a music box. But perhaps it was broken, as it wouldn\u2019t make a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eFufufu, there\u2019s actually a secret compartment to it. It has a trick to it. Try opening it as I tell you.\u300f</p><br/><p>Creeping out from under the bed, she brushed off the sweat with her hands, and tried following the voice\u2019s instruction to open the box. It was a complex mechanism and method. But the box itself did feel strangely heavy. It looked to be made of wood, but it was as if it had been strictly sealed off.</p><br/><p>And once she had undone those complex contraptions, what she found was a yellow gem, a few centimeters across. The voice she heard was coming from there.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Celes. I know you, but you do not know me. My name is Agrissa\u2026 You\u2019ve at least heard of me before, haven\u2019t you?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You jest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking the Yellow Jewel in hand, Celes laughed a bit. But she felt power from the Jewel. The yellow radiance was like that of the finest gemstone, a charm that made it feel as if she was being sucked in.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s not a lie. Your grandmother was my descendent. She was also cute, but she was stubborn, you see. She wouldn\u2019t make any dealings with me. Originally, that box should have been entrusted to another to manage, but that Zenoire\u2026 at the end of the end, she said she couldn\u2019t trust you, and kept it hidden away. It was an object she couldn\u2019t throw away so easily. It seems she was considerably worried\u2026 and at the end of it all, her life\u2019s flame went out.\u300f</p><br/><p>Celes listened to the story the Jewel told.</p><br/><p>And when she heard of what the Jewel could do, she smiled wide.</p><br/><p>She spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re helping me, right? Then what\u2019s the price?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eOh, no wonder Zenoire was wary of you. You do resemble me in my youth. That\u2019s right\u2026 you have to entertain me. And if ever comes the time that you breathe your last breath, give your body to me. I want to revive.\u300f</p><br/><p>There, Celes\u2019 smile extinguished.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s all? That\u2019s all I must give to take everything from Lyle? That\u2019s certainly shady. I was sure you\u2019d tell me to give you my body at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Agrissa laughed.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re a firm one. There\u2019s a considerable amount of courage resting in you yet. I see, so to you, it\u2019s worth is but a trifle. But if you think of what my revival would mean, it would be a major problem for the continent.\u300f</p><br/><p>Celes scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the measly cost I must pay to get what I want, it\u2019s a cheap buy. Very well, if I die then do what you want. That\u2019s all it takes to obtain power that exceeds his\u2026 it\u2019s cheap as can be.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Celes held the Jewel up high, it began to let off an amber light.</p><br/><p>\u300eThen let it be so. I will lend my power to you. First, let us awaken your Skill.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026 On that day, Celes laid hands on an immense power. This encounter would spread death and destruction through the continent.</p><br/><p>This was also the start of a battle that enraptured the continent as a whole.</p><br/><p>Claire (#\u309c\u0414\u309c): \u201cNo matter how you look at it, the war criminal here is my mother-in-law! Manage it more strictly! And wait, at least tell me something about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zenoire (#\u00b4\u2200\uff40): \u201cHey, I noticed Celes\u2019 abnormality. The mother who overlooked it is the war criminal. Rather, I wouldn\u2019t trust you if it was the death of me. To add to that, I hate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eighth Generation Head (\uff1b \u30fb`\u0434\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cF-father!? In these situations, who do I side with\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation Head :(\uff1b\u309b\u309c\u2019\u03c9\u309c\u2019): \u201cYou fool! Don\u2019t get any closer! We haven\u2019t heard a thing. We haven\u2019t seen a thing. And that is the truth!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

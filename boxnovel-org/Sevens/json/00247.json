The reason being it contained some well-used materials, and despite its low difficulty level, you could find materials you couldn\u2019t get in Beim\u2019s managed Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>The personnel change poster only had a single receptionist\u2019s name written in. And it welcomed volunteers.</p><br/><p>Seeing her own name filled in, Marianne was a little shocked.</p><br/><p>And to her, Tanya\u2019s voice called out from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Marianne. May I have a bit of your time? \u2026 Don\u2019t be so wary. I\u2019ve lost the need to lay a hand on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning around, Marianne subconsciously put herself on guard. Giving a self-deriding smile, Tanya beckoned her towards an unused conference room on the second floor.</p><br/><p>The two entered the room to find that it hasn\u2019t even been prepared for the early-morning newbie explanatory meeting.</p><br/><p>Marianne-san looked at Tanya, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLost the need to lay a hand, meaning\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could say it to the end, Tanya crossed her arms, and lowered herself onto a table.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was Lyle-kun. In yesterday\u2019s announcement from the Guild, he brought the Sweeper masks along. Saying you were being attacked, and that he saved you. Do it again, and you\u2019ll meet the same fate, is likely the message he wanted to get across.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle hadn\u2019t just taken out the masks in front of the executives to rile them up. He was indicating that sending Sweepers was pointless.</p><br/><p>And the conclusion the Guild came out with was to dispatch a receptionist to the new branch in the south. The receptionist name that rose up was Marianne.</p><br/><p>Close to Lyle\u2019s party, and they didn\u2019t want to keep her anywhere near the internal workings of the Guild. But as they couldn\u2019t dispose of her, they were sending her away.</p><br/><p>From Marianne\u2019s point of view, it was to save Erhart\u2019s party. She had raised up a number of parties, but perhaps she found something lovable in them, as Erhart\u2019s party was her favorite.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not against a move to the south. So did you have some business with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tanya nodded, and stated her business.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other branches don\u2019t have the leisure to dispatch adventurers south. The sea-based North Branch has circumstances too far removed. Of the West Branch, one first-rate party was completely wiped out, while another has already been determined to transfer south. It seems the Queen of Cartaffs told them to take it up. She really has us by the throats.\u201d</p><br/><p>The South Branch. As it was mercenary specialized, it was unable to send adventurers. And many mercenary brigades had already left Beim.</p><br/><p>The only one left was the East Branch that suffered little casualty.</p><br/><p>\u201cErhart-kun\u2019s party will be heading south. He\u2019s too close to Lyle-kun to keep\u2026 I believe you\u2019ll be the one getting the Guild together on that side.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Labyrinth\u2019s scale wasn\u2019t large. Even if it were to be managed from here, it would remain small-time, or so Tanya informed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take around two more personnel from the Guild. Please hire the rest at the site. Well, in essence, it\u2019s an exile, really. Beim has no interest in its south. For the Magic Stones and materials, it seems some merchants are migrating as well, so please go have a talk with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Marianne questioned it a little. It was as if Beim was being divided up.</p><br/><p>(The merchants with the Tr\u0113s House at the center. And the Guild personnel\u2026 adventurers. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s just cleanly picking away only what he needs\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be!)</p><br/><p>Marianne felt it was as if a small Beim was being born in the south.</p><br/><p>\u201cTanya, could it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She confirmed her own anxiety with Tanya. Tanya spoke without changing her expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe got us. After investigating, it seems many craftsmen will be moving via the merchants. He\u2019s really completed a mini-Beim for himself. Lyle-kun\u2026 I really don\u2019t want to think this was all by his expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marianne didn\u2019t think Lyle had been moving about at random.</p><br/><p>Sucking up funds from Beim, then the favorably factioned merchants and the craftsmen\u2026 and it felt as if he\u2019s stolen the adventurers and the relevant knowhow from the Guild.</p><br/><p>That sensation as if they were dancing on the palm of his hands made the two of them fear him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Rauno had come to the southern base set up for Labyrinth Subjugation.</p><br/><p>Whenever a Labyrinth was to be cleared, everyone would set up a base outside, but it was only natural for Beim to establish it to the level of a small town.</p><br/><p>But those organized districts held a skillfulness as if there was a plan for a town to be there from the start.</p><br/><p>Leading small Innis along, Rauno matched her pace as they walked the streets.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a lonely land. If you call it a base for Labyrinth Subjugation, it should be more a place for the squalid singer, and the invitation of harlots. If it doesn\u2019t have a crude feel to it, it\u2019s not interesting at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you walked the town, you\u2019d take in the smell of food from the stalls, and in the bars, the adventurers who\u2019d pulled out of the Labyrinth made merry regardless of night or day.</p><br/><p>Harlots would try to draw in customers, and adventurers making lewd glances at them was a standard sight. But there was none of that here. There was nothing.</p><br/><p>Grasping Rauno\u2019s hand, Innis spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was your homeland?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rauno scratched his head with his spare right.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 My last boss wasn\u2019t there. Seems he retired. He wasn\u2019t one to be loyal to her majesty, he was of the old king\u2019s time after all. There weren\u2019t many left who I recognized.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking care of the dirty work, Rauno had pretty much been driven out of Cartaffs. And he had come to hate his job.</p><br/><p>He had a Skill to infiltrate anywhere. So jobs unbefitting a knight were pushed on him, and he was looked down on by his surroundings.</p><br/><p>For him to continue fulfilling his duty was only loyalty to his country. But the words the previous king had bestowed upon him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018The shame of Cartaffs\u2019 Knights.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026 They were.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that Queen\u2019s different from her straight-laced predecessor, but\u2026 I wonder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Innis strongly gripped his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cRauno-san, you want to go back to being a knight, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He gave a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it look that way? No, if you\u2019re the one saying it, I\u2019m sure I do. That may be it. Maybe I want to be recognized as a knight. There was a time even I held onto immature ideals, or so I\u2019ve come to think these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those na\u00efve ideals were still somewhere in him, he noticed as he told it to Innis.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, Innis\u2026 did you get the information?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Rauno\u2019s serious voice, Innis nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what was the result?\u201d</p><br/><p>Innis spoke in a low voice so only Rauno could hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-san plans on using Beim. In the end, he will be exiled, and the world will treat it as if he lost. But the four-country alliance and Cartaffs\u2026 they have a piece in it all. They\u2019re sure his exile was a skillful means to escape the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEscape from what? From Celes of Bahnseim?\u201d</p><br/><p>Innis shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cVarious things. If he stayed in Beim as a hero, Lyle-san\u2019s movements would be heavily restricted. I\u2019m sure it will be easier for him to travel lighter from now on. It seems Lyle-san was against receiving full support from Beim. And what split Beim in two was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a voice called over to the two of them.</p><br/><p>It was Novem, doing her shopping.</p><br/><p>\u201cInnis-san, and Rauno-san as well. So you made it here?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a voice calling from behind, Rauno answered with an indifferent attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Because I can earn more if I stick with my valued customer over here. You\u2019ll continue using our services, right? I want to set up an office, but would there happen to be an open space anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason he had come south was to chase after Lyle. It wasn\u2019t because he was a customer. It was because Innis had foreseen the ruin of Beim.</p><br/><p>Novem brought her left hand to her mouth, and giggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a huge help. I\u2019ll prepare one at once. If you have any specific wishes, I\u2019ll dispatch someone to assist, so please say it at the time. Fare thee well.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem parted from the two of them, Innis gripped Rauno\u2019s hand even stronger. Rauno looked at her, and found she was a little frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s just a probability, but Novem-san was keeping an eye on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Innis was wary of Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo that great an extent? She didn\u2019t have that sort of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Innis spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person will do anything if it\u2019s for Lyle-san\u2019s sake. That\u2019s the sort of person she is. And I\u2019m scared. When I look at that person, it\u2019s as if I feel something nostalgic\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, please pay it no mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rauno scratched his head, before leading Innis back to the inn\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Roland entered the developing port on a Tr\u0113s House ship.</p><br/><p>To meet the one taking command, future Grand Duke of Galleria, Leold.</p><br/><p>Making way for Leold\u2019s room at the most splendid building of the port, Roland took out the arbitrarily sent notification.</p><br/><p>Since he wasn\u2019t in public, Leold wore a casual short and trouser, as he worked through paperwork.</p><br/><p>When Roland entered the room, some tea was prepared for a break.</p><br/><p>Once an employee brought the tea, Leold wrapped up his work, and kept Roland company. But his bearing was rude.</p><br/><p>Roland wondered if he was being belittled as he politely started into talks.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have dropped by in regards to the letter delivered to Beim. The Grand Duke Proxy stated you were the one with the right to decide, and would say no further, so I\u2019ve directly come to pay a visit. Please tell me. Why have you one-sidedly decided to break off all dealings with the Tr\u0113s House? You haven\u2019t forgotten how much aid we\u2019ve given you in this endeavor, have you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leold looked at Roland as he took the cup to his mouth, and sipped a bit of tea. And after parting it from his mouth, he held the cup in both hands.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We\u2019re honoring the contents of the contract. The one we contracted was the settlement south of Beim, was it? With Fidel-dono there and the Tr\u0113s House he served acting as representative. We definitely did not contract the taken-over Tr\u0113s House. Which means to say, we do not recognize your claim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Showing a bit of fatigue, Leold\u2019s shirt sleeves were stained with ink from all the paperwork. His hands were a little darkened as well.</p><br/><p>There were bags under his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeim has officially recognized the Tr\u0113s House as having been inherited. If you don\u2019t call this a breach of the contract, I\u2019ve no words to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leold-kun replied nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether Beim recognized it or not\u2026 it doesn\u2019t really matter. The four-country alliance is formally planning to protest Beim after all. Brother-in-\u2026 I mean, Lyle-dono was handed an exile from practically nothing but false charges, causing us to doubt their credibility. And more than anything, you who exiled your relatives to take over the house lacks credibility as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roland stood from the sofa, and spoke in a face of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you thinking to make an enemy of Beim? It\u2019s true you\u2019ve joined four hands, and I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve build a cooperative relation, but even so, every year\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes, every year, we purchased goods at Beim. Well, they were mainly weapons and the like, but Magic Stones as well. However, our situation has already changed. War is on a sharp decline. What we need isn\u2019t tools of war, but tools to make our lives abundant. We\u2019ll need a fixed amount of weapons, but we can produce that much ourselves. Did you know? By driving out several merchant houses, you\u2019ve forced a number of craftsmen who\u2019d lost their place to flow to the alliance. Lyle-dono has voiced a desire to offer them a warm welcome, and we for one will answer to our benefactor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roland hung his head.</p><br/><p>He was regretting the Tr\u0113s House\u2019s loss of credibility at his hands. But by the time Roland had learned of Gina\u2019s plan, it was too late to turn back.</p><br/><p>And living while glared at by Beim\u2019s conference of merchants, to the Beim-raised Roland, it wasn\u2019t something he could imagine.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can you give us rights to use your port?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leold spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no such intentions. The four country alliance shall support south of Beim. Our future dealings will be centered around there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roland, in regards to those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you are underestimating the power of Beim. How many years do you think it will take for a small port town to develop in the south? You say you can make a living without any trade in that timeframe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leold spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one making underestimations. It\u2019s a fact that Beim is a prominent metropolis of the continent. I doubt there\u2019s a product you can\u2019t obtain in that city. But by looking down on its surroundings like that, it should learn how hatred builds up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roland looked at Leold\u2019s eyes, and faltered a little. He had worked a majority of his time within Beim, and he had few chances to venture out to other lands.</p><br/><p>And the first look directed straight at him from the outside world made him swallow his breath.</p><br/><p>Leold instantly reverted his expression, and spoke to Roland.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo home. We have no need to follow the decisions of Beim out here, and we don\u2019t have such plans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roland left the room, and mulled over how he would explain it at the next conference of merchants. Only on the prerequisites of handing over interest in the port, had Roland been recognized as the Tr\u0113s House\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Once that was lost, he hadn\u2019t the slightest idea what they would say.</p><br/><p>Roland decided to swiftly return, and set up countermeasures with Gina\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 On the land that had become the front most line with Beim, Blois spat out a sigh.</p><br/><p>What he was to pass on from Bahnseim was, no matter how you looked at it, Pandora\u2019s Box. There was no doubt some portion of that merchant\u2019s body was in the box, and the situation had come down to him delivering it to Beim alongside a declaration of war.</p><br/><p>Confirming the letter in his office, he found it contained orders to prepare to invade Beim.</p><br/><p>His adjutant knight looked at him and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral, I can understand why you may not be on board, but we must abide royal orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the earnest knight, Blois sat deeply into his seat, and lifted up the papers in one hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. Impossible, I say. A Beim invasion\u2026 I don\u2019t feel we\u2019ll lose, but how many troops and goods do you think that would require? On top of them having built that troublesome fortress, the final objective is attacking that metropolis of Beim. You\u2019ll need a legion of one to two hundred thousand, I tell you. Prepare all by ourselves? That isn\u2019t happening. Now I have to go crying to someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blois couldn\u2019t decide whether it was good or bad that the merchant of Beim hadn\u2019t returned alive.</p><br/><p>(Well, rather than returning with their hearts stolen, maybe it\u2019s a better result for the poor man. Better than laying low in Beim, and betraying his friends and family, at least.)</p><br/><p>The merchant who\u2019s gone to see Celes, brimming with confidence, had returned in a different shape entirely. Whatever remained of his well-rounded body fit in a box he could hold in one hand.</p><br/><p>The knight spoke in worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you ignore orders, you can\u2019t avoid execution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blois gave a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that. But the practical problem here is how the area\u2019s rule has divided people, and we\u2019re lacking in hands. I can only explain the present situation, and seek help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The knight looked at Blois.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s you, general, wouldn\u2019t you be able to conquer it? You did say there wasn\u2019t much of a need to fear Beim before, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that knight\u2019s words, Blois offered a revision.</p><br/><p>\u201cDude, you\u2019d do well to remember a bit of the details. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re saying Beim is nothing special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. If we\u2019re going to war as the premise. And Beim has never even thought to expand its territory, so there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll be invading from their side. Well, firing people up and causing wars is the extent they go for. Then worming their way in with commerce and such, they\u2019re skilled in seduction, and using the back door, and that sort of thing. They\u2019re more formidable of an enemy in times of peace. But if you fight them, you can definitely win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that Blois showed the knight a certain document.</p><br/><p>It was the mercenary brigade he had hired to compensate his lack of hands. Even upon seeing that, the knight didn\u2019t seem to understand it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Formerly a mercenary brigade enrolled at Beim\u2019s South Guild Branch. During Beim\u2019s defensive, it seems they were tasked with protecting the important points. Their scale large, and their quality isn\u2019t bad. But they\u2019re mercenaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>If hired, they\u2019d join either side. And you could even say they had full knowledge of Beim. They knew how much treasure was in the city, and to them, it was a place easy to fight in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe city of merchants and mercs\u2026 it\u2019s going to fall.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, Blois prepared a letter addressed to the royal palace at the center. An explanation of the present situation, and a request for reinforcements\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>LYLE, who\u2019d come from my room of memories, was talking with the ancestors.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf it isn\u2019t garters, I\u2019d have to say stockings.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the Third compared me and LYLE with a serious face.</p><br/><p>\u300eI see\u2026 so Lyle had a foot fetish all this time? I happen to prefer behinds.\u300f</p><br/><p>I to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t start up on your sexual preferences. Are you not embarrassed?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third laughed.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhen I\u2019m already dead? Rather, this sort of thing is vital. It\u2019s important to know yourself. Isn\u2019t it fine? Being a foot-fetishist?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t arbitrarily label me a foot fetishist!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I cried out, the Seventh followed through.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right! Considering Lyle\u2019s eye level up to now, I\u2019ve already concluded him a lover of large breasts. He keeps taking glances at them, so there\u2019s no doubt about it. So if you call him a foot-fetishist, even Lyle will get angry, Third Generation Head.\u300f</p><br/><p>Come so far, I just realized the Jewel displayed things from my point of view, felt embarrassed, and sat on the spot.</p><br/><p>LYLE didn\u2019t stand up for me.</p><br/><p>\u300eBut I like Vera\u2019s chan\u2019s chest that seems to be non-existent, but surely exists. I want to rub my face against the part of her thighs you can see between her skirt and socks!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are the worst.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, the Fifth looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, I can only see it as you shouting complaints at a mirror. Just accept it. That\u2019s the first step.\u300f</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to recognize this pervy brat as myself. When I thought that, Milleia-san gently placed a hand on my shoulder.</p><br/><p>She held up her thumb.</p><br/><p>\u300eFret not, Lyle. I had Miranda buy some clothes besides garters as well. Just like me, that girl has a nice body on her.\u300f</p><br/><p>Before I could deny it, the Seventh opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300eHahaha, though your chest size couldn\u2019t be any more different. Aunty\u2019s dubious sizing can\u2019t\u2026 ow!\u300f</p><br/><p>From her fluttery sleeve, she swiftly pulled out a one-shot gun, and shot him.</p><br/><p>Since we were in the Jewel, it ended with nothing but an ow. In real life, it was an exceedingly outrageous scene.</p><br/><p>\u300eBrod-kun, did I teach you it was alright to say such things to a woman? Good grief, you haven\u2019t changed a bit.\u300f</p><br/><p>I had some interest in the Seventh\u2019s past, but to change the topic, I turned talks to Beim.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, with this, Beim has divided as planned. Even if one is crushed, we have a spare, but\u2026 will I really go off on a journey just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before we could show Bahnseim our movements, I was to go through the four country alliance, and Bahnseim through Cartaffs, finally heading to Faunbeux from there.</p><br/><p>The Third shrugged his shoulders as he sat on the table.</p><br/><p>\u300eThere\u2019s no helping it. We need the power of Faunbeax and the other surrounding countries at all costs. If you give them a letter form the alliance and Cartaffs, it will add to your persuasive power, so don\u2019t worry. Well, the problem is how Faunbeux is a huge Walt hater, I guess.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh had revived, clearing his throat, and ignoring the Third\u2019s gaze. The kingdom of Faunbeux\u2026 they had fought with Bahnseim a number of times, and had suffered a crushing defeat and lost much land twice by Walt Hands.</p><br/><p>Right now, they held land of around two third their golden age. The one who shaved off the extra third was the Walt House.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, the Seventh was heavily involved. When an army of Faunbeax was rejoicing over a victory, he had beaten them, and driven them back. Nabbing some land while he was at it.</p><br/><p>So when it came to the house there, we were nothing but enemies.</p><br/><p>Within that, the Fifth stood from his seat.</p><br/><p>He looked at the silver weapons floating above the round table.</p><br/><p>The First\u2019s giant sword.</p><br/><p>The Second\u2019s bow.</p><br/><p>The Fourth\u2019s dagger.</p><br/><p>The Sixth\u2019s halberd.</p><br/><p>Those four glowing weapons were suspended in air, and after a light breath, the Fifth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Lyle, before your journey, I\u2019ll teach you my last Skill. Map, Dimension. And finally, \u3010Real Map\u3011. It can show the surrounding terrain as a three dimensional map, and you can read off the finest of movements. It\u2019s a Skill where you can shift the viewpoint to any place you\u2019d like to see. Well, it\u2019s convenient for travel, so it\u2019s just right.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth said that with a resolved face, so I felt a little sorrowful at how he was finally going to entrust me his Skills.</p><br/><p>An animal lover, and with many children, he was always cold to them, a man who left a large problem for the house.</p><br/><p>Differing from the image handed down, he was a person who always looked somewhat unmotivated. Of smaller build within the house, and a person that giant Sixth Generation wasn\u2019t able to beat to the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Let\u2019s move to your room of memories.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I stood. The Third looked down, while the Seventh watched me and the Fifth with a serious face. And yet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Why are you arbitrarily pushing things along over there? I\u2019ll just throw this out, but as the guide, I hold a higher authority in this Jewel than father, you know? I won\u2019t let him disappear just like that. \u300f</p><br/><p>As I turned to Milleia-san, LYLE folded his hands behind his head.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight, I knew I should have told Lyle about that earlier.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth pointed at Milleia-san.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou lot! What are you saying! I don\u2019t have anything left to hand down to Lyle\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>There, Milleia-san corrected her posture with a serious face, and turned back to him.</p><br/><p>\u300eSure you do. Don\u2019t you father? Lyle should know what you had to endure. It\u2019s a fact he has no choice but to know if he\u2019s going to aim for emperor\u2026 and for Lyle to learn of you, I do not recognize the inheritance of your Skill.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth\u2019s Skill inheritance was prevented by Milleia-san\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

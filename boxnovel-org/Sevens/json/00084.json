Just to let you know. I\u2019m not home for days, so I can\u2019t pick up my copy yet.</p><br/><p>http://mypage.syosetu.com/mypageblog/view/userid/218376/blogkey/1112258/</p><br/><p>Sevens Question Corner 5</p><br/><p>Q: You won\u2019t use \u3010Mind\u3011 on the Circry House\u2019s old man?</p><br/><p>A: Third Generation Head \u30fd(\u00b4\u30fc\uff40)\u30ce: \u201cThere\u2019s a restriction placed on its use. Well, this is also an important lesson, and I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d die on something of Hippogryph level, so I decided to wait and watch. Even if he did use it, I doubt it would prove anything, and for the current Lyle, he may make those he uses it on wary of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Is Norma actually skilled? Or hopeless?</p><br/><p>A: Fourth Generation Head ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201c\u2026 To put it bluntly, incompetent. If she had tried to make handing over commanding rights any more difficult, I would\u2019ve made her a field casualty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation Head ( \u30fb\u03c9\u30fb): \u201cBut she did have something going for her. If she had a better environment to grow, I think she\u2019d have become skilled. She\u2019s sharp on how to survive, and she\u2019s willing to change her point of view. Unfortunate, perhaps?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40): \u201cBy the way, she\u2019s not joining the harem. I think Novem would oppose. And wait, even if it grows any further, I\u2019m still going to be devoted to Novem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem (\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40 ): \u201cOh my\u2026 looks like a little\u2026 training is in order.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About the education of second and third sons. The characters appearing in this work are just plain stupid. It\u2019s simply obvious to educate them properly in the case something happens to the first son.</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head ( \u309c\u0434\u309c)\u3001: \u201cIt\u2019s natural for their parents to educate them? There\u2019s quite a bit going on in a fantasy world, you know (Monotone). Huh? Could it be that everyone\u2019s properly educated and you\u2019re the one living in a fantasy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sixth Generation Head \u03a3(\u00b4\u2200\uff40||;): \u201cU-um\u2026 even in reality, those besides the heir are sent off to the church on occasion, and taken back in when the first son passes. Personally handling their education is up to the individual. Yeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation Head (\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40 ): \u201cIt takes alms and contributions and money. Education is the same. And wait, the knights incapable of heredity, and the far end knights are poor. If they were all decent, the expeditionary force would never have been sent out to reduce the mouths to feed. Because if a war is to happen, those sorts are going to find an abundance of work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Generation Head ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@) : \u201cThis is probably about Breid and Doris\u2026 Breid is basically a third child without heredity. A position where rather than the studies of a knight, he should have been thinking of how to live a civilian\u2019s life. Everything besides reading, writing, and arithmetic were likely unnecessary. No, more so, a family that even taught him that must have treasured him quite a bit? Also, about Doris and sister\u2026 There are those that see girls as fine as long as they could birth children. In the truest sense, she was Miranda\u2019s spare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Is Lyle actually talented?</p><br/><p>A: Seventh Generation Head \u03a3\u03a3(\u309c\u0414\u309c\uff1b): \u201cHe\u2019s an able child! Lyle is a capable one I tell you! Because he\u2019s competent, he can\u2019t understand the feelings of those who aren\u2019t, and he\u2019s just lacking in socialization dammit! A pitiful boy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle (\u00b4\uff1b\u03c9\uff1b\uff40): \u201cGrandfather, please stop\u2026 you\u2019re making me sad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: The ancestors are strange. In the first place, if they made Lyle stand out, he\u2019d be conspicuous to all the wrong eyes. They let him take on a request with little merits, riddled with demerits, and let him make a completely unnecessary expenditure.</p><br/><p>The fact that you\u2019re using the ancestors to forcefully move along the story without thinking of means and goals is becoming much too blatant.</p><br/><p>A: Third Generation Head ( \u309c\u2200\u309c): \u201cAh, yes, it truly is just as you say. He sure does stand out~ (Monotone). He starts standing out even if he doesn\u2019t want to~ (Sparkle Sparkle).\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Generation Head ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I really care if Lyle stands out or not. I think the Sixth and Seventh in particular still want him to flashily take back the territory, so perhaps they thought it best if he did? Also, everything\u2019s an experience. Wouldn\u2019t it have been fine if he failed? More so, I think that piling up this sort of experience is a cheap buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sixth Generation Head (\u30fb\u2200\u30fb): \u201cIt\u2019s best you don\u2019t think that the best actions will always result in the best result. Failing when you can, and learning from it is just as important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Clark is too proficient. Why can\u2019t he get a promotion?</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head (\u00b4\u30fb\u2200\u30fb\uff40 ): \u201cWell, there\u2019s quite a bit, but I think it\u2019s his disadvantageous personality. Individually, I think he\u2019s wonderful, but in the world, assets and connections are a necessity for promotion. Rather than the knights being rotten, there\u2019s too many people that getting a promotion is hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation Head ( \u00b4\u2200\uff40): \u201c\u2026 If a war broke out, he\u2019d get to the top in a flash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Marcus and Breid\u2019s punishment.</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation Head ( \uff40\u30fb\u2200\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cNo change! Just get them promoted already. That way, you\u2019ll raise hell on the damn imperial bastards. Flood them with incompetents!\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation Head (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40): \u201c\u2026 Unlike Lyle, they had little opportunity to learn, so I do pity them a little. There\u2019s no need to look after them all the way through, and if they don\u2019t wish for it, there\u2019s no meaning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Celes\u2019 stay in the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head (\u30fb\u2200\u30fb): \u201cThe Walt House occasionally drops by the capital, but Celes is not currently taking an extended stay there. I\u2019m not sure about the future, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About the yellow gem</p><br/><p>A: Lyle(\u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: That Growth joke is something of a one-shot gag. I\u2019d like it if you stopped.</p><br/><p>A: Third Generation Head ( \u309c\u2200\u309c): \u201cWell too bad! That\u2019s the setting the world\u2019s built upon, and mr. lyle will continue to appear! No matter who hates it, mr. lyle will come!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

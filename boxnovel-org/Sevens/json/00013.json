Getting the grass into order, and gathering the lawn refuse into a single place.</p><br/><p>It was a matter of seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like using that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>While she didn\u2019t like the restrictions of that magic, there was much too little time for her to take care of the entire mansion alone.</p><br/><p>Today, she was going to go on to clean its insides, and she also planned to prepare lunch.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiranda-san and Shannon-chan are coming back, and we\u2019ve been under their care, so splurging a bit is\u2026 but I wonder just how much of a reward Lyle-sama accepted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes met those of a cat wandering atop the yard\u2019s wall.</p><br/><p>As Novem tried approaching it with a smile, the cat hissed with its hair on end, before hurriedly running off.</p><br/><p>Seeing her own extended hand, Novem thought to herself for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, it\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheering herself up, she picked up the basket to head in to clean the kitchen.</p><br/><p>There, a voice called out to her.</p><br/><p>It was Shannon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, so you\u2019re alone today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Shannon smiling, and giving off a different atmosphere than usual, Novem didn\u2019t show any signs of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? I don\u2019t see Miranda-san with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe left me, and headed over to the academy. It seems there was some sort of problem. I wonder just what sort of trouble your comrades caused.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Shannon giggled to herself, her eyes were definitely focused on Novem.</p><br/><p>Novem noticed she was being watched. But for the sake of the girl who liked pretending to be blind, she helped guide her to her room.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, so let me take you to your room. Even so, a problem at the academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought that perhaps something had happened to Lyle.</p><br/><p>But she could imagine the sorts of things Damien would perpetrate.</p><br/><p>Believing that Lyle would be able to persevere through them, Novem extended her hand to Shannon.</p><br/><p>Shannon returned a vulgar smile in return.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I think it would be best if you stopped making such a face, Shannon-chan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon being warned, Shannon started talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what happened, but onee-sama\u2019s resistance has become incredible. Even when I try pulling at her heart, there\u2019s nothing for me to grasp at\u2026 that\u2019s why I think I\u2019ll try taking you. I mean, you\u2019re already something like Lyle\u2019s doll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s doll.</p><br/><p>Hearing that Novem thought to herself for a moment.</p><br/><p>That probably wasn\u2019t a mistake.</p><br/><p>She acted for Lyle\u2019s wellbeing, and existed for his sake.</p><br/><p>But Novem also knew those weren\u2019t nice words to be directing at a human.</p><br/><p>So she cautioned her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be saying such things to people. Now let\u2019s get you to your room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon grasped Novem\u2019s right hand.</p><br/><p>A clear indication she could see it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t you be more skillful than that? At the very least, you\u2019ve been able to put on that unseeing act all the way to now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Up to now, Shannon made sure to play the blind girl.</p><br/><p>She had never acted in such a blatantly obvious manner.</p><br/><p>(Could she be panicking?)</p><br/><p>After hearing of how Miranda was resisting, she began to feel something like impatience from Shannon.</p><br/><p>The doll she had finally gotten her hands on was stolen, so actions she would never usually do were coming out.</p><br/><p>Shannon\u2019s something touched Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not revealing anything! With this, you\u2019re my doll! Since you look much weaker than onee-sama\u2026 weaker than\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon was acting strange.</p><br/><p>Novem spoke in a kind tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease unhand me, Shannon-chan. Now let\u2019s be off to your room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon opened her eyes wide, and looked at Novem.</p><br/><p>She hurriedly dropped the hand, and toppled onto her back.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t seem to be in pain.</p><br/><p>Without removing her eyes from Novem, her limbs were shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Novem took a step towards her, Shannon found a scream forming in her throat, as she retreated in kind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour clothes have been dirtied. I\u2019ll wash them, so let\u2019s get you a change.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were natural actions from Novem, but the current Shannon saw them as something much more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 just what are you\u2026 you\u2019re not human. There\u2019s no way you can be human\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of the wide-eyed Shannon caused Novem to freeze up for a moment.</p><br/><p>She tried putting her hand to her face, which had now become expressionless.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Not human. So I\u2019ve been told that once more.)</p><br/><p>It was a bother. As she thought that, Novem put on a kind face once more.</p><br/><p>She was troubled over just how to call out to the shaking Shannon\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShanon-chan\u2019s eyes\u2026 there\u2019re really pretty, you know. I was sure they were amber, but now they look golden to me. Just what sort of world do you see with them? I\u2019m quite curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that she saw the world differently, that she had the ability, all of it was known to Novem.</p><br/><p>She had known, but had acted oblivious.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that Shannon had quit acting blind, so her interest had been piqued. She tried turning the conversation\u2019s topic towards that, but\u2026</p><br/><p>What did Shannon think upon hearing that?</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t actually thought it that far through.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiii! Stay away\u2026 don\u2019t come any closer!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon screamed, before passing out in front of Novem.</p><br/><p>Novem looked upon the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Letting out a small sigh, she patted Shannon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>And like that, she lifted up the girl\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Into a princess cradle.</p><br/><p>But there, she felt a presence closing in on the mansion at an incredible speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem looked over the fence, and spotted Lyle sprinting towards her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright, Novem!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had coincidentally used a Skill.</p><br/><p>Seeing the map spread out in a larger scope than I expected, I sensed a red presence by Novem\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>I hurriedly ran out of the academy, and used the Fourth\u2019s Skill to get here as fast as I could.</p><br/><p>With that momentum, I jumped over the Circry House\u2019s mansion\u2019s wall, but there was a mountain of pulled weeds where I landed, so fell forward.</p><br/><p>As I was heading towards the ground, I made sure my body slid to reach Novem\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>I think there\u2019s something wrong with the sliding part of it, but I think I showed up with quite an amazing pose, if I do say so myself.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A-are you okay, Lyle-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood and brushed away the dirt before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m even applauding at myself for thinking of a new innovative landing pose on the fly. More importantly, are you okay, Novem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Shannon in her arms, I figured there was likely no problem.</p><br/><p>I did look over her just in case.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I was just a little startled\u2026 so why do you have that bug with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem looked at the bug in my right hand with an expression of wonder.</p><br/><p>I had spotted it while I was running here, and captured it.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t really go around whacking the girl, so I thought I would punish her with her detested bugs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Shannon\u2019s punishment time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I presented the bug before Novem, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOw! This one bites!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bug bit my finger, so I threw it aside.</p><br/><p>With that, it flew off, and seeing that, Novem started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean Lyle-sama\u2026 it\u2019s as if you\u2019re a little boy trying to tease the girl you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>I flipped my hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cMen are those that constantly live with the hearts of their youth. How about it, have you fallen for me again?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, I heard the sound of a table being smacked from within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>Everyone was acting together, and I heard laughing voices along with whacking sounds\u2026</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>(Hmph, to the current me, it doesn\u2019t matter how much the ancestors act up. This Mana overflowing through my body\u2026 truly wonderful.)</p><br/><p>While I considered how dreadful my own talent was, Novem looked at me, and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve fallen for you many times over, Lyle-sama. Now, let\u2019s carry Shannon-chan to her room. Ah, what happened to the materials and the reward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Having been asked, I prepared a response.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you see the maid said that was a nice piece or something, so she ended up keeping it. I mean, they were only offering a slightly higher price than at the guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>I think selling it would have been fine, but she went on about it being a perfect thickness or something, we reached some mutual understanding, and talks proceeded in the direction of not selling it.</p><br/><p>Damien took a liking to the awakened maid, so if we stopped by at fixed intervals, it became that we wouldn\u2019t have to pay a maintenance fee for her.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s thought of plenty of ways to use a maid, it seems.</p><br/><p>\u201cA maid, is it? Was it not an automaton? Also, about the magic\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFret not! I was able to learn the magic known as \u3010Golem\u3011. But I really should be mad at that one. It\u2019s something anyone can use, but the type that requires immense talent to master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem seemed satisfied with that.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s about the golem magic I was taught, but in essence it was ridiculously simple.</p><br/><p>It was simple\u2026 but to put it bluntly, applying it was hard.</p><br/><p>Even if you\u2019re moving them, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re seeing things from the dolls\u2019 points of view.</p><br/><p>You have to see them with your own eyes, and decide exactly how they\u2019ll move. On top of that, if your own eyes get blocked up, it\u2019s impossible to decide how they should move.</p><br/><p>To use them like Damien, it really takes talent.</p><br/><p>If I\u2019m going to use multiple at once, two is my limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you did accept a reward. I heard that Miranda-san hurriedly headed off to the academy, but did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you knew\u2026 the truth is, the automaton I took as a reward became quite an attraction. Something about it being a crystallization of the technology long lost, or something, and the academy students came to see it. It was amazing, you know. It was as if it were a real human!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I happily explained, the Fourth asserted himself.</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, kid. Explanations are fine and all, but how long do you plan on having Novem-chan hold up Shannon-chan like that? Carry her to her room quickly, ya\u2019 fool.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third too.</p><br/><p>\u300eReally. Oh, I\u2019d also like to request a line from you while you\u2019re carrying her.\u300f</p><br/><p>If it was a single line, then I thought that would be fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sorry \u2018bout that. I\u2019ll carry her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, I took the girl in my arms, and looked into her face.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not sure what happened, but I could see the whites of her eyes, and drool was dripping out from her open mouth.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a waste of her good looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 today I\u2019ve got some fate with sleeping beauties.\u201d</p><br/><p>But the fact that I won\u2019t waste it is one of my good points.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleeping beauty, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the story where a kiss wakes the princess. That\u2019s how I awakened the automaton.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Kiss, is it? I see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, the Sixth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eToday\u2019s Lyle sure has a perfect cutting edge to him!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh too.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is a once in a lifetime chance Lyle! Someone like you is\u2026 fine, keep at it.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second seemed to be in pain.</p><br/><p>\u300eStop it already\u2026! Any more of this, and my abs won\u2019t hold up..!!\u300f</p><br/><p>They were quite lively.</p><br/><p>Thinking that, I entered the mansion.</p><br/><p>Novem walked behind me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, what do you think of Shannon-chan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? I think she\u2019s cute. Simply cute enough to eat up. But it\u2019s unfortunate\u2026 for a girl this small, my kiss can\u2019t be the one to wake her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem thought for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Her body seems sturdy, and she doesn\u2019t get sick, apparently. Her eyes are\u2026 well, let\u2019s just give them a passing grade. She has the blood of the Walt House in her, but it\u2019s a distant relation, so that\u2019s not a problem. Okay, understood. I\u2019ll do something about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019ll leave it to you. Oh, whoops, I left Aria behind. I\u2019ll have to go get her later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I saw her giggle to herself.</p><br/><p>Unlike usual, the impression she gave off was quite soft.</p><br/><p>It made me feel good as well.</p><br/><p>(For me to be able to get Novem to direct such a smile at me\u2026 Aren\u2019t I too amazing!?)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

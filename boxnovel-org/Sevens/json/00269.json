Please await good news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before setting off, he showed off his prided armor, and reporting to Celes, he thought he could make her look his way.</p><br/><p>But near her holding a large platter, Rufus\u2026 the crown prince was feeding her fruit.</p><br/><p>With a pose that indicated she was mildly in thought. Her mouth moved to chew, and around were men whose faces turned red with that gesture alone. Wearing dangerously exposing clothes mismatched to the room, those men that surrounded her\u2026</p><br/><p>They were all beautiful, and they all loved her. No, they were her prisoners. Giving up their once wives and lovers, at the moment, they were Celes\u2019 toys.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeim? Oh right, come to think of it, I did say something like that. These days, the number of nobles with the disposition to rebel has gone down, so it\u2019s grown boring. But moving all the way to Beim is a pain, so\u2026 yeah, Breid, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Even if it costs me my life, I shall eradicate all humans of Beim without fail!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said he\u2019d use their lives to redeem the sin of insulting Celes, the royal guard\u2019s morale was quite high. Yet it was a group whose lives had already been thrown away to her charm.</p><br/><p>Celes seemed uninterested.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you find anything interesting, bring some back, kay? Today, one of the hostage men I\u2019d always been interested in finally bent to me. So I\u2019d like to return to the inner palace already, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Breid hurriedly apologized.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-my deepest apologies! I shall depart at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes simply giggled to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Come to think of it, that piece of trash is in Beim. Breid, bring that \u2018medicine\u2019 with you on your travels. When nothing else works, make use of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>That medicine\u2026 it was brought from Zayin, and with repeated human experimentation in Bahnseim, it was a medicine to unite man and monsters.</p><br/><p>On those words, Breid experienced a fright.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-but Celes-sama, there\u2019s no need to go that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes stood herself up on Remis, and looked down on Breid from a high place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho asked you to talk back? This time\u2019s isn\u2019t a medicine that will kill you at once. And weren\u2019t you to risk your life for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>On those words, the surroundings showered malice on Breid. Those countless sharp glares continued falling down on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cP-perish the thought! I merely wanted to answer to your expectations before a need for such a medicine arose! All of me is yours, Celes-sama. If you order it, I shall fulfill any mission for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he gave a forced excuse, Celes showed a smile. She had immediately seen through that it was a lie. A face that understood Breid simply didn\u2019t want to end up in a pitiful state.</p><br/><p>A cold sweat flowed down Breid\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll forgive it. In exchange, you will work to the bone for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she stepped down from Remis, and returned to the inner palace so early in the morning. The men around her. And crown prince Rufus followed behind.</p><br/><p>After feeling relief, Breid thought in his heart.</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s the chance I\u2019ve finally grasped. I want to serve under Celes-sama for all eternity. I don\u2019t want to use something that would make me such a thoughtless monster. Now then, if that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be, I need some achievements in Beim. And voila, perfect timing. There\u2019s that man in Beim\u2026 Lyle, you\u2019re going to be dying for me. I\u2019ll present your head to her, and I\u2019ll enter her inner palace. Then as a man, and as a vassal, Celes-sama will finally look at me.)</p><br/><p>His sense of values warped, Breid swore in his heart to get hands on the head of Lyle, who\u2019d clearly shown their gap in ability last they\u2019d met\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Bahnseim\u2019s frontmost line.</p><br/><p>In that place where a neighboring country once stood, Blois Cadel looked over the armies that arrived one after the next.</p><br/><p>Large scale forces of thousands. Small forces of dozens.</p><br/><p>An extensive gathering of nobles from knight to duke had gathered.</p><br/><p>Blois looked at that army, and let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we were so short staffed here, they had this many men to spare, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alongside his adjutant knight, they looked out at the gathering armies from the office the country\u2019s king once used.</p><br/><p>\u201cPreparations to receive them has greatly derailed our schedule though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blois laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. We were prepared to take a few ten thousand, and gathering the documents for those anti-Beim strategy meetings was hell. Now then, if another problem were to pop up, it would have to be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The adjutant nodded with a serious look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have to be the royal guards and elites coming from Centralle. It\u2019s true they have achieved results, but I\u2019ve only ever heard bad rumor about them. That they massacre by choice, and such. They aren\u2019t giving the slightest thought to postwar rule.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blois returned to the desk, and took some documents in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreid Vamper. Born to a knight house without any heritage. Raising his status with military exploits, he became an official knight, and went right into the royal guard. Looking at his history alone, he\u2019s splendid. The knight he defeated was a noted name in Bahnseim, and all.\u201d</p><br/><p>His adjutant knight made an unsatisfied expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems he participated in that Gryphon Subjugation unit. He may be an acquaintance of the Walt House\u2019s eldest son in Beim. Should we proceed with caution?\u201d</p><br/><p>On those words, Blois shook his head. The adjutant knight had never see Celes in close proximity. Some part of him was making light of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not happening. He\u2019s a man who got as far as her royal guard. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s madly in lover with Celes-sama. Of course, the problem is how he\u2019s never properly commanded a squadron before. Yet despite that, he was granted thirty thousand, and this large-scale war is his first real war. It would be nice if he doesn\u2019t intrude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blois half-expected him to throw the battlefield into disorder.</p><br/><p>Before the black lines of troops before them, the two men predicted just how terrible the impending invasion of Beim would become.</p><br/><p>Blois spoke\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to keep casualties as low as possibly, you know. Though I know there\u2019s no way in hell that\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Having headed to Faunbeux to request cooperation, we used a sea route through Cartaffs, and returned to South Beim.</p><br/><p>Arriving with Vera Tr\u0113s on a fully loaded Vera Tr\u0113s, we met up with Novem\u2019s unit that had arrived beforehand, and with Adele-san\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>With her pink hair in a ponytail, Lianne was wearing clothes easy to move in. With a travel case stuffed with goods she had gotten together in Cartaffs, she descended the gangplank.</p><br/><p>Her appearance didn\u2019t look like a princess\u2019, but she did have the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is South Beim. I\u2019d heard of it, but it\u2019s quite developed. Quite a few ships anchored, and plenty of goods moving around the port.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was giggling. I was aware the contents of her luggage all pertained to war.</p><br/><p>After Bahnseim declared war on Beim, South Beim had started preparing in a great rush.</p><br/><p>When Novem approached us, Miranda waved her hand at me. And she looked at Shannon, who\u2019d disembarked with us.</p><br/><p>\u201cShannon, you didn\u2019t cause them any trouble, did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Miranda\u2019s smile, Shannon averted her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-of course not. How many pinches do you think my quick wit saved us from? Lyle was the one dragging us through hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t argue with that. The pink haired demon smiling beside us strangling my neck with that bloodcurdling expression on her face was the biggest pinch we went through.</p><br/><p>But the one who saved us wasn\u2019t Shannon, but Parselena-san the hostage.</p><br/><p>Seeing Shannon sending eyes looking for some backup around, Clara dismounted, and decided to nod.</p><br/><p>But Miranda sensed it was just for show.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you did trouble them? Well, not like I didn\u2019t see it coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I did my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lending an ear to the sibling conversation, I received Novem\u2019s report. I had gained the information through Monica, but I still wanted to verify it.</p><br/><p>No, perhaps I just wanted to talk with Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cAny new info?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone. Beim still seems to believe it can do something by itself. Like reinforcing Fortress Redant, with Beim\u2019s residents joining in, they\u2019ve gathered a force that exceeds a hundred thousand and such\u2026 that sort of talk has drifted in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Surrounding countries were hesitant to assist Beim.</p><br/><p>Beim had cut me off. That action alone had dragged those surrounding lands into the situation, driving Beim into a corner.</p><br/><p>I looked at Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do hope Beim does it\u2019s best. I really need them to persist as much as they can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is going as you anticipated. After this, if our devices work well, it should bring about the expected result.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem seemed to think the plan I\u2026 no, me, the ancestors in the Jewel and Milleia-san had thought out would definitely work.</p><br/><p>And I spoke to Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Novem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her face as she waited for my words, I swallowed them down. \u2018Do you love me? Leaving out the Walt in my name, I mean.\u2019 Seeing myself about to say that, I felt a little ashamed.</p><br/><p>Dammit, I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, it wasn\u2019t something to discuss in a place like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Since we\u2019ve all just returned, let\u2019s rest a bit. And this is Lianne-san. Though you\u2019ve already met before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lianne gave Novem her greetings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure, Novem-san. As my senior, I hope you\u2019ll bring my up to speed. I couldn\u2019t help but put Ludmilla-san of Cartaffs on guard, and we weren\u2019t able to talk about much. But I do hope we get along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem smiled at Leanne.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure. Let\u2019s get along, Lianne-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLianne is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can call me Novem in kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their smiling exchange, to the uninitiated onlooker, it may have looked pleasant. By why is it, I wonder\u2026 it looked as if they were putting checks and balances on one another. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just tired. No doubt about it.</p><br/><p>Must be because all I\u2019d seen in the Jewel was the Fifth\u2019s threatening, and the Sixth\u2019s failures.</p><br/><p>Shaking my head, I looked between Novem, and the other side of me, with Aria, Clara, and Miranda and Shannon.</p><br/><p>And Shannon spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Their Mana is violently clashing. Novem is redirecting it to the side, but that Lianne princess is going on an amazing offense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda looked at Lianne.</p><br/><p>\u201cA troublesome foe. I can\u2019t think I\u2019ll lose, but taking her on will break my bones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Miranda as she said such a thing, Aria looked fed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we all just\u2026 get along a bit? Rather, why do I have to be so mindful among allies?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara addressed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken, Aria-san. It\u2019s precisely because we\u2019re allies, that we have to be so mindful. It\u2019s the same within family.\u201d</p><br/><p>As we had such a conversation at the port, Vera and Monica descended the ramp.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You\u2019re still here? I recommend you go back and rest soon. Once it gets busy, you won\u2019t be getting any proper rest, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Experiencing a worried Vera\u2019s kindness, I reassured myself Novem and Lianne were definitely not carrying out politics.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Beim.</p><br/><p>Manning the receptions desk, Tanya pushed her hair back behind her ear.</p><br/><p>Managing her usual desk as her other face\u2026 her Sweeper face felt how quiet the guild had been as of late.</p><br/><p>Feeling a little lonesome at the east branch\u2019s situation where there were still just as many troublemakers around, she let out a light sigh.</p><br/><p>After Lyle\u2019s party had left Beim, they had grown considerably busy. And the atmosphere in Beim was becoming more inclined towards war by the day. At this point, many adventurers had been requested for city defense, and stationed long-term.</p><br/><p>Because of that, there were less adventurers returning to the guild after a successful day\u2019s work.</p><br/><p>Tanya felt it was the calm before the storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only it ends without anything too great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s actions, and the large country of Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>As all of them tried to swallow Beim up, Tanya felt it all tightening\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ve no mind to clean up a mess besides one of my chicken dickwad\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Monica said that with all earnesty, Aria stuck her glare on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you really like Lyle, now don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria stood up within Porter, and looked outside.</p><br/><p>Behind, the Gryphon was being preserved in a block of ice.</p><br/><p>It had few wounds, and was taken out in a single blow, so it was carefully preserved for its high profit prospects.</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s quite likely that would never reach up to the five hundred gold they had lost.</p><br/><p>In front, Norma was mounted on a horse, leading the troops with an enervated expression on her face.</p><br/><p>Those who had yet to undergo a complete recovery.</p><br/><p>Those killed in action were loaded on a horse cart, and taken along. Lyle and the rest of the party were walking close to Porter.</p><br/><p>Novem was talking as she walked, while Clara was sitting on Porter\u2019s roof, operating the golem.</p><br/><p>But Marcus\u2019s group wasn\u2019t alongside them.</p><br/><p>(But there\u2019s no helping it.)</p><br/><p>After the banquet, various things had happened, and they began taking distance.</p><br/><p>Aria looked at Novem conversing with Lyle, and thought back to what happened when they left the village.</p><br/><p>At the time of parting, Lyle had been talking to the boy from the village.</p><br/><p>He was the boy Lyle had looked after all throughout their stay, and Lyle even went as far as to bestow his weapon unto him.</p><br/><p>Seeing his kind face to a child, Aria found it unexpected.</p><br/><p>(So he isn\u2019t just kind to women.)</p><br/><p>Finished gazing outside, she sat down on a wooden crate inside Porter, and saw Miranda wriggling around.</p><br/><p>She let out her face, and was making a terribly dark expression.</p><br/><p>To put it bluntly\u2026</p><br/><p>(Uwah, how scary!)</p><br/><p>Even Aria made a repulsed expression.</p><br/><p>She was always all smiles, but since the end of the battle, it didn\u2019t seem she had such leisure.</p><br/><p>She only directed a forced smile whenever Lyle was around.</p><br/><p>And having even lost her usual courtesy\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shannon, water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon hurriedly prepared water, and Miranda rose to drink it.</p><br/><p>Her light dress was soaked in sweat, and perhaps she wasn\u2019t feeling the best. Her expression held no elegance.</p><br/><p>After the banquet.</p><br/><p>Miranda had severely rebuked Marcus and his group.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s likely because she didn\u2019t like how Lyle hadn\u2019t pressed them any further for their slip up, and even submitted a report that could lead to a promotion as promised.</p><br/><p>The Hippogryph hadn\u2019t brought about any casualties, and in the end, Lyle was the one to deal the final blow.</p><br/><p>The way he didn\u2019t seem to mind it too much must have irritated her.</p><br/><p>And besides business-like conversations, Lyle no longer involved himself with Marcus\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Having finished the water, Miranda wiped her face, looked at Aria, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>She would usually say that with a smile, but now she glared with sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>It may have scared her in the past, but the current Aria had grown up a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing really. You looked like you were in pain, so I was looking at you. In that state, I\u2019m surprised you can still make a smile in front of Lyle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria had meant that in jest, but as she herself was also feeling under the weather, she wasn\u2019t able to make it show in her tone.</p><br/><p>And unable to smile, Miranda reacted by twitching her eyebrows. Shannon began shaking in fear.</p><br/><p>Looking at that, Monica\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is this a scene of carnage? How nice. I was just getting bored, so I wanted to see one in person, you know. Now the two of you, fair and square, the muddy soap-opera fight of two women in love\u2026Fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she began working herself up, Shannon tried stopping a smiling Monica.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, don\u2019t be starting a fight in a place like this! And what the hell\u2019s a \u2018soap-opera\u2018!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something like a play. Now on with the live carnage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s strange in the head!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 She was broken from the start, so it was only natural\u2026</p><br/><p>When Miranda tried to stand, they heard a knock on Porter.</p><br/><p>After a while of silence, Lyle opened the door.</p><br/><p>The golem had halted movement, so it was likely break time.</p><br/><p>Aria spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it already time for rest? On the way here, we only stopped at lunch, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lyle poked his head in, Miranda continued making her pained face as she formed a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI proposed that we take breaks more frequently. Also, there are some that want to defeat monsters along the way to rack up some numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Defeating monsters along the way, those that were barely able to perform on the battlefield could earn some merits.</p><br/><p>And Lyle decided to buy up the materials and magic stones from that.</p><br/><p>Lyle spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the both of you alright? I\u2019ll take up watch today too, so just rest at ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Miranda, she\u2019s quite dark herself.)</p><br/><p>While looking at Miranda, Aria thought that. Suddenly, Shannon fixated her eyes on Lyle\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The light moved\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this girl saying?</p><br/><p>The question surfaced in her mind, but without her usual composure, Aria ended up letting herself rely on Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you. And wait this time\u2019s really heavy. I\u2019m scared for what\u2019s to come\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The high tension resulting as a reaction from Growth.</p><br/><p>The results varied by the individual, but perhaps Aria and Miranda had surpassed the maximum permissible level of experience, as it was taking their bodies quite a while to get over it.</p><br/><p>Aria didn\u2019t let by the doubtful reaction Lyle made for an instant.</p><br/><p>(He\u2019s surely remembering his own Growth.)</p><br/><p>With a smile on his face, Lyle spoke to the four inside Porter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to go outside for a change of pace, then I highly recommend it. Monica, Shannon, you two are to help with work outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Normally, Shannon would hate it, but because of the mood inside, she almost burst into the great outdoors.</p><br/><p>While Lyle made a surprised face, she begged for him to give her some work.</p><br/><p>Monica walked outside, and while she was closing the door\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure not to get in your way, so take your time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026. Said that.</p><br/><p>Perhaps she was waiting expectantly for the two to fight. Her smile was quite irritating.</p><br/><p>Neither Aria nor Miranda wanted to fight of their own wills.</p><br/><p>Both of them wrapped blankets around themselves, and rested their bodies\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Separating from Porter, I looked up at Clara.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure that was alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It would be troublesome if they went on a rampage inside Porter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon and Monica took up their work, and I talked to Clara.</p><br/><p>It was something I already knew, but this party was lacking in numbers.</p><br/><p>In all seriousness, I wanted to recruit a few in.</p><br/><p>Around us, there were many a soldier with the same pained expressions of Aria and Miranda-san.</p><br/><p>We stepped off the path, and lay down by the roadside to rest.</p><br/><p>I heard the Fifth\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re using the Fourth\u2019s Skill to compensate for movement speed. It\u2019s quite a large force, but Lyle\u2019s mana should be able to deal with it.\u300f</p><br/><p>Perhaps they had gained confidence in their abilities, as a large number of soldiers and volunteers took the initiative to go out and engage monsters.</p><br/><p>Our movements as a group were much better than at the start, and we had achieved a victory, so the mood wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>The Third heedlessly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eI wanted to promptly stick it to Norma at the start, but looking at the result, it turned out perfectly fine.\u300f</p><br/><p>From my point of view, as we had casualties, I couldn\u2019t really call it perfect.</p><br/><p>I do think we reduced the damages to the least we could, but even so, deaths arose.</p><br/><p>(If only I had done a little better\u2026)</p><br/><p>When I made a complex face, the Fourth spoke to me.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, I hope you\u2019re not thinking you could\u2019ve gone about it better, right? Even if you do what\u2019s needed, there will be deaths and damages. Thinking that your efforts could\u2019ve prevented it all is nothing but arrogance.\u300f</p><br/><p>And the Sixth agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Regretting after it\u2019s all over won\u2019t get you anywhere. If you did it the best you could, then stick out your chest.\u300f</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not in that sort of mood.</p><br/><p>(Those standing at the top sure have it rough.)</p><br/><p>When I got a taste of that feeling, I experienced just how heavy having responsibility was.</p><br/><p>The Seventh\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is another good experience. I thought it would be a boring job, but it looks like Lyle\u2019s learned an essential lesson.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026 At the start, it was a request from the Circry House Head.</p><br/><p>A frail unit was to take on a Hippogryph, and it was expected that many casualties would surface.</p><br/><p>But in truth, the opponent was a Gryphon, and annihilation was more than possible.</p><br/><p>I recognized once more my own naivety.</p><br/><p>(The voices I can hear have decreased\u2026)</p><br/><p>The First, and now the Second\u2019s voices were no longer there.</p><br/><p>When I took the Jewel in my hand, Clara called over to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-san, did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t go about giving the whole truth, so I offered her an excuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just a little curious about Luka. I wonder if he\u2019ll properly study.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, Clara smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was quite enthusiastic, and after he learned a little, he was quite delighted. Ah, another thing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Clara was making her usual expressionless face, I noticed her complexion was a little pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you feeling ill? Then take a rest at once\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m, well\u2026 looks like it\u2019s come for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Come?</p><br/><p>When I started pondering her words, Novem raced over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama! Over sixty percent of the troops have been hit with degradations to their physical states. We did obtain a large amount of experience, so perhaps it will go on to spread to the entire corp.\u201d</p><br/><p>For an amount of experience too great, or an experience one had never gone through before, there were several common patterns of how the body dealt with it.</p><br/><p>The Second said it, but there\u2019s the case where my physical condition collapses completely, and after that, I revive.</p><br/><p>And there\u2019s also the case where the body instead takes its sweet time processing that experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad. Let\u2019s hurry to the next town. There, we\u2019ll stay a night or two, and observe the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After I said that much, I get the feeling some expectant glances were directed at me from within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>In a small voice, the Third\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 mr. lyle\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Whispered.</p><br/><p>(I-it\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t feel any different this time. I\u2019m the type that needs an enormous amount of experience to go through Growth.)</p><br/><p>I took a deep breath to calm myself.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no such change going throughout my body.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t feel heavy either.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-anyways, let\u2019s pick up the pace. Dispatching one knight to explain the situation, and building up preparations would be best.\u201d</p><br/><p>I did have some leisure with my previous payment so I\u2019m still fine with gold.</p><br/><p>When I started thinking of whether or not to fork over money\u2026</p><br/><p>The Fourth gave a proposal.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, right\u2026 while we\u2019re at it, why not spread a little rumor?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth spoke with intrigue.</p><br/><p>\u300eOh? Perhaps that would be nice. It\u2019s not bad for our return to be a little late.\u300f</p><br/><p>Following the flow, the Third\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eThen it\u2019s decided. It\u2019s at times like these that the troubadours\u2026 those singers make it so much easier.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, before those imperial rats can make a move, let\u2019s cement it in legend. It will spread to the Capital soon enough. Even if we\u2019re unable to move for a time, we can at least spread some hearsay. By the time they set out to control the situation, it\u2019ll be too late\u2026 wonderful!\u300f</p><br/><p>Troubadours were those that spoke of affairs of the world and stories. At times they would sing, and at times, show off their technique.</p><br/><p>A majority of them were elves.</p><br/><p>Their race mainly lived in the forest, but as a nation of hunters, they didn\u2019t really form settlements. No, perhaps it\u2019s more correct to say they couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Because of that, they would sing songs as they travelled, and earn some money by polishing their skills, and showing them off.</p><br/><p>Their way of life was one easy to make fun of, and there were quite a few foreign spies who infiltrated among them, so they were refused the right to settlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem looked at me with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s send someone ahead first. After that, if there happens to be a troubadour in the village, let\u2019s try spreading the details of the incident to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem put her hand to her chin in thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps that would be nice. But there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll find one there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just on the level of, \u2018it\u2019s nice if one\u2019s there.\u2019 No need to worry too deep into it. If the village seems starved of good entertainment, we can spread it ourselves if we really want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Deciding to move as such, we sent out Clark-san alone to find the nearest village ahead.</p><br/><p>(Even so, it will become troublesome if even Clara becomes incapable of movement.)</p><br/><p>Before we returned to the Imperial Capital, I wanted everyone to be back to normal.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After spending two nights at the village and departing, as expected, a strange air began to envelop the camp.</p><br/><p>Aria\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 want to become a bird. I want to fly on and on in the open skies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda-san was in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I totally get you there. Lyle, won\u2019t you be my bird cage?\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave an immediate response.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara held her hand to her mouth as she\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see, so you want to hold that spear as your wings, and hop around the battlefield some more? I get it. Miranda-san, how about you go get yourself jailed already then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara isn\u2019t a girl to say such things!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I thought, but the surrounding soldiers\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I return, I\u2019m going to propose to the girl back home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s now, I think I can thank mum for all she\u2019s done for me! Thanks for givin\u2019 birth to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You guys, I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t head that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The final soldier looked upon the bright men with a dark expression.</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene, Monica spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what it is. It\u2019s interesting, but it\u2019s nowhere near the level of the chicken dickwad when I first met him. Each and every one of them\u2019s got a foot on the brakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did seem a little tired, but more so than anything, she was sending some expectant glances in my direction.</p><br/><p>On Shannon\u2019s side\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me! Aria\u2019s started reciting a strange poem, and onee-sama\u2019s started prattling on about the meaning of love and life and all that jazz! It\u2019s unbearable!\u201d</p><br/><p>She clung to me in tears, but I averted my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurely you jest! Just what are you expecting me to do!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Aria\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the noble lady of a baron fallen down to adventure. Oh, woe is me\u2026 Powerless I am, I swing my spear, yet that gallant soldier a guise it be. If you will take my penny, I\u2019m more delicate than any, and starving for love as all.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she directed fluttering glances at me, I averted my eyes.</p><br/><p>Clara was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven for a former lady, one who gets excited at the sight of blood, and would have likely been a general by now had she been a man can\u2019t be called powerless. Rather than starved for love, are you not thirsty for blood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda-san\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, why is it these burning feelings in my chest can never get across to Lyle!?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at me, and her expression was quite serious, so I averted my eyes once more.</p><br/><p>Clara\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t get across, but that you\u2019ve been flat out rejected, right? Reality sure is a cruel mistress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crushed by Clara\u2019s harsh objections, the two of them seemed to sink into past events they wanted to forget.</p><br/><p>Novem spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time\u2019s Aria-san is quite severe. Lyle-sama was quite a trial last time, but for her to be this\u2026 at most, she would sing some of her self-composed songs, and that would be the end of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked to Novem, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? I never heard of any of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you were out cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I knew, I would have been able to grasp at her weakness\u2026 while thinking that, we reached the exact halfway point to Centralle.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>(An enemy? Two orcs.)</p><br/><p>Thinking that, I looked to the direction the enemy was at.</p><br/><p>We did have lookouts stationed, so the reaction of the troops was fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo orcs! They\u2019re coming towards the center body!\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked like the two were headed to the center of the group.</p><br/><p>We all stopped and entered preparations for battle, but everyone was in a dangerous post-Growth state.</p><br/><p>The knights as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s now, I can beat an orc with a single knife!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was even an idiot who voiced something like that.</p><br/><p>(I guess I\u2019ll take care of them here.)</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem, I\u2019ll handle them. Force everyone to wait on standby here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? \u2026 Y-yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than surprised, it seems she wanted to say something, but she put that on hold and abided my orders.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s just two orcs, it won\u2019t take any time at all.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I thought when I headed off to defeat them.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After the aftermath of the Orc battle.</p><br/><p>I was lying down flat on Porter\u2019s loading tray.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-whyyyyy!!!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly couldn\u2019t muster any power in my body, and that was accompanied by a pain I had never felt before.</p><br/><p>On top of sore muscles all through my build, my Mana was too used up, and I felt my consciousness would drift somewhere far away.</p><br/><p>Even letting out a loud voice brought pain to my body, and looking after me, Monica looked quite delighted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNursing the damn chicken to health\u2026 I won\u2019t concede such an important role to any other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd no one else wants it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside Porter, me, Monica and Shannon rode.</p><br/><p>Outside a merry expeditionary force was marching on, and the symptoms of Growth came to visit me right after the orc battle.</p><br/><p>The Third raised an expectant voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eFinally! It\u2019s finally here! mr. lyle is!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth carried out some calculations.</p><br/><p>\u300eAt this rate, it\u2019ll be before we reach Centralle? No, perhaps once we\u2019ve barely arrived\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eThis boy\u2019s timing is\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle\u2019s sure got it. Besides luck, this sort of\u2026 pff\u2026!\u300f</p><br/><p>Continuing on from the laughing Sixth, the Seventh as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe first Best Lyle in a while\u2026 I get the feeling I can get my hopes up.\u300f</p><br/><p>I muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201dD-don\u2019t screw with me\u2026 this time, I won\u2019t be meeting anyone.

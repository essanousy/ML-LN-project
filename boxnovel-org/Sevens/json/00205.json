The strongest \u2018Celes\u2019 card has been placed on the field. Meanwhile, your field has nothing but a single \u2018\u2019Damn Gigolo Lyle\u2019 card\u2026 With this, you\u2019re over, Third Generation Head!\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation Head (\uff40\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4): \u201c\u2026 Not yet!

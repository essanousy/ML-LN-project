I placed both my hands on the table, looking at my ink-stained digits as I muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Something is wrong. This isn\u2019t the sort of revolution preparations I had in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the Jewel I had placed as a weight to prevent the pages from flying away, I heard the Third\u2019s blissful voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou sure are stupid, Lyle. You\u2019re the leader here, so it\u2019s only natural you\u2019re stuck with loads of paperwork. Going out and doing actual work is obviously left to your subordinates.\u300f</p><br/><p>It was a sound argument, but I had imagined going out on the site more to give this order and that. But reality had me holed up in my office, surrounded by guards and chased to the ends of the earth by paperwork.</p><br/><p>Even if I had a chance to go out, a majority of it was speeches and meetings, and truly detestable stuff. Inside the room, the one who was charged with looking after me today, Valkyrie Unit Three sounded delighted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019ve finished preparing your tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many cups do you plan on preparing today? I\u2019m already full to the brim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unit Three had finally picked it up\u2026 or rather than picked up, she had gained the ability to do it, so she repeated the action of roasting tea again and again to appeal to me.</p><br/><p>My stomach hurt from tea overload.</p><br/><p>It had been a few months since the battle with the Walt House.</p><br/><p>The preparations to fight Celes were underway. It would be a battle of continental proportions, but even the country that ruled this land before Bahnseim\u2026 in the Sentrass Kingdom\u2019s era, battles of this scale were a rare sight, I\u2019m sure.</p><br/><p>A large scale battle exceeding that of the one three hundred years ago was to unfold.</p><br/><p>In the documents, Monica put together the reports raised by the Valkyries stationed across the land.</p><br/><p>As I took the orderly document in hand and read it through, it even included illustrations to make it exceedingly easy to understand. There were graphs as well, so just a glance was enough to understand the current situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s been a pause in Faunbeux\u2019s efforts to take in its surroundings. It\u2019s quite a surprise that there are still countries trying to watch and wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>When such a scale\u2026 several million soldiers would be moving on multiple fronts, I was surprised there were still countries who decided to wait it out. There, the Third explained the surrounding situation to me.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, this world isn\u2019t one that can be measured by your own reality\u2026 you can\u2019t gauge everything based on your common sense alone. In a war of this scale, it isn\u2019t strange for there to be countries where the scale exceeded their expectations to an extent they can\u2019t even make a decision. Perhaps there are disputes raging on within.\u300f</p><br/><p>I looked at the report as I asked the Third.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then should I take that into consideration, and deal with them post-war?\u201d</p><br/><p>But the Third spoke level-headedly.</p><br/><p>\u300eThere\u2019s no need. If you swoop in later to take all the good stuff, there are countries who won\u2019t be satisfied. You\u2019ve got to direct their dissatisfactions elsewhere.\u300f</p><br/><p>Even if I said unifying the continent, it\u2019s not like that would succeed just by defeating Celes and Bahnseim. I\u2019d have to succeed in rule for anything to start. And I\u2019d need to maintain it after that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Cartaffs\u2019 preparations are ready, and Djanpear\u2019s on board, so the problem would be our own eastern front.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yet the army I commanded took in the Walt House army, so we already had the numbers together. I believe we have a force good enough that I\u2019m not embarrassed to call it the army of the leading power. If there was a problem to speak of, I guess it would be the rattled state of Beim?</p><br/><p>Given the time, we\u2019d be able to gather more numbers, but even now, the time for our attack was indeterminate. No, we could attack at any time, but\u2026</p><br/><p>I took a different report in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 For her to chip away at her own war potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 What Celes accomplished in Beim was the construction of a grave for our father. But father was a man of the Walt House, and a Count at that. Yet she gathered workers to build a grave more splendid than any emperor\u2019s, and despite the busy season, not only men, she gathered women as well to aid in the construction of this massive tomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that girl even doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I could only feel fed up, the Third appraised her actions from within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eJust as Agrissa before her, I\u2019m sure she wants to make this continent into a sea of blood. To be honest here, I doubt our common sense will get through. Though it\u2019s creepy as it gets.\u300f</p><br/><p>I thought the death of our father would instigate some sort of retaliation, but that wasn\u2019t the case. We were neatly able to bury the corpse in a modest grave.</p><br/><p>But I could conclude that the stolen portion of the remains were Bahnseim\u2019s doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is creepy. Well, it\u2019s been creepy from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I got back to work, Unit Three spoke to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, the time of your meeting approaches.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Meeting with whom? If it\u2019s about Damien\u2019s demands, send him around to Adele-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it seems Marianne-san who became guild master of South Beim is coming for a meeting. She wishes to voice an opinion about the management of Magic Stones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Marianne-san\u2019s name, I stood. To place the guild under government rule, I would have to draft up various rules.</p><br/><p>So I had made a request for its framing, and Marianne-san and the other guild-related personnel immediately sent in their complaints.</p><br/><p>If they were going to put up a frantic resistance over the robbing of their interests, crushing them was possible. But even accepting the new management, there were many things the Guild couldn\u2019t help but be troubled with. Matters related to such contents were brought over to me.</p><br/><p>\u300eBecause Adele-chan\u2019s no good at this sort of thing. Lianne-chan doesn\u2019t know enough about adventurers, so it all comes down to you.\u300f</p><br/><p>It was just as he said. What\u2019s more, it was a matter I couldn\u2019t be negligent with. Anyways, in order to take the Guild\u2019s rights, and keep it functional without problem, I\u2019d have to hear them out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, let\u2019s get to it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 In Bahnseim\u2019s royal palace, a portion of Maizel\u2019s body was delivered to Celes\u2019 room.</p><br/><p>Embracing the box that held it, Celes\u2019 eyes filled with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome home, dear father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, she opened the wrapping, and gripped the staff-rapier with the Jewel embedded in it. The Yellow Jewel let off light, and the corpse she had prepared in advance began to move.</p><br/><p>The box floated in the air, its contents absorbed into the dead body, completing its human form.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Celes, I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maizel smiled at her. In the room, her mother in a similar state stood as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, just look at you. And you call yourself the head of the Walt House!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Claire looked angry, Maizel offered his apologies.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I wanted to get a present for Celes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddess, you\u2019re so late father. We\u2019ll have a grand party today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying she didn\u2019t care about getting a present, Celes happily linked hands with her parents.</p><br/><p>Within her Jewel, Agrissa sat in a pompous chair as she looked over the scene. In the inside of the Jewel that was designed almost like a throne room, she crossed her legs as she took on a condescending attitude.</p><br/><p>Twirling her golden hair around her fingertips, her violet eyes reflected the outside world.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Cute and pitiful Celes. Even if you revive them, they\u2019re nothing more than containers. No, perhaps they\u2019re even too incomplete to serve as that.\u300f</p><br/><p>Agrissa had perfected a Skill to revive dead, but as she looked at the results, she seemed quite unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf I had succeeded, I would have revived my own parents. And children. I don\u2019t really care about the rest\u2026 no, the Walt House, eh? I\u2019d have revived that man who defeated me as well. That was a good one. A truly splendid man.\u300f</p><br/><p>Seeing Celes sandwiched between her marionettes as she jumped for joy, Agrissa smiled. But her expression clouded over at once. As the outside visible from within the Jewel faded away, she stood, and looked at the door behind her seat.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 When you can\u2019t even revive a measly human, what sort of goddess are you supposed to be? Well, even if you could, you aren\u2019t even revered as a goddess to the world anymore.\u300f</p><br/><p>Agrissa was once an existence born whilst inheriting the memories of Septem. To speak to this generation, there was Novem and Celes. But the memories she carried on were only the broken parts\u2026 she only had the memories of each generation\u2019s Septem being worked to the bone by mankind.</p><br/><p>Her memories as a goddess were vague, but she had a general idea of what happened. However, being worked to death by those she gave her everything to, at times oppressed generation after generations, those memories strongly remained in Agrissa\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Tracing her lips with her fingertips, she slumped her body back into her seat.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then\u2026 even if I keep quiet, the continent will be dyed in blood. How many millions shall perish? I can\u2019t wait. I simply can\u2019t wait.\u300f</p><br/><p>Walking off, she entered her room of memories. In it, the forms of the oppressed Septems watched here.</p><br/><p>Not in Agrissa\u2019s flashy, exposing attire, the gentle Septems that wore their plain, beaten up rags. Those Septems sent Agrissa some chastising eyes.</p><br/><p>In that room of memories, Agrissa laughed to her self.</p><br/><p>\u300eJust stand there and watch, predecessors of mine. What you could never accomplish, I\u2019ll fulfill your role of protecting all your dear humankind. Of course, not like you who would give anything they desired\u2026 but by taking everything away.\u300f</p><br/><p>The eyes of the voiceless Septems turned grim. From the chains of the memories they carrieddown, the existences that would give everything to humans unconditionally.</p><br/><p>To they, Agrissa teased.</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t be so angry. I\u2019m benefitting mankind much more than any of you. The reason humans kill each other is simply because there are too many of them. So I\u2019ll thin them out. It sure is painful. It\u2019s painful to kill my dear humans so.\u300f</p><br/><p>Breaking into a grand laugh, her voluptuous and beautiful form twisted as she pleasantly sneered.</p><br/><p>And she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eAre you that angry I came to the same conclusion as Novem who once opposed you? I won\u2019t blame you\u2026 I mean, that one hates humans. No way you would forgive her.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Septems began sending Agrissa eyes of pity. Hit with such glances, Agrissa swung her left hand, and made the Septems fade away.</p><br/><p>\u300eHow irritating. I\u2019ve grown tired of teasing and playing around.\u300f</p><br/><p>Saying that, she looked up.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow Celes\u2026 the time of our promise is soon to approach. Until then, enjoy it all you want.\u300f</p><br/><p>Agrissa\u2019s laugh reverberated through the room of memories\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Evening.</p><br/><p>The one who entered the room with a frightfully threatening air was Novem.</p><br/><p>Enough that I stood from my chair and took a few steps back in surprise. I mean, unlike usual, she was honestly angry. Not like the anger directed at a mischievous child, honest to goodness angry.</p><br/><p>Did I do something?</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what\u2019s wrong Novem?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I timidly said that, Novem got her breathing in order as she corrected her posture before my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon my intrusion. But there was something I had to confirm, so I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry. So, Lyle-sama\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before her uncharacteristic intimidation, I felt as if my voice would turn inside out. From the Jewel hung at my neck, the Third panicked.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat did you do, Lyle? I\u2019ve never seen Novem-chan this angry at you before.\u300f</p><br/><p>Neither have I. While I had a few inklings as to why she could be angry, I got the feeling none of them were enough for her to be this angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what could it be!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I heard from Baldoir-dono. Is it true that you desire peace, and are setting it as your final objective?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat? No, I definitely did say it. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m thinking of immediate peace or anything, and my thoughts over what exactly to do to attain peace aren\u2019t fully in order yet. I just thought it would be nice if we could actualize it in a few hundred or thousand years is all.\u201d</p><br/><p>I understand it\u2019s difficult, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mistaken to try and take the first step. They were words I said in my high tensions, but I don\u2019t have to mind to deny them.</p><br/><p>Novem seemed terribly depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 They weren\u2019t the drunken words of your post-Growth state?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Baldoir talked to me, I was in the state the Third calls \u2018mr. lyle\u2019. But his opinion wasn\u2019t particularily different from mine or anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, what of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem spoke in regards to me. More serious than I had ever seen her before.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, peace is always naught but an illusion. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a troubling one that poisons those that partake in it. It is only in a world where they cannot live without fighting that humans become strong. Once they stop fighting, mankind will degrade in kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you today? This isn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that with a laugh, Novem drew closer. And she grasped both my shoulders. Her fingers dug in, and I could feel some pain.</p><br/><p>Her eyes opened with, and it felt as if the light had faded from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot like me? No, I am serious. The one who isn\u2019t like himself is you, Lyle-sama. When you\u2019ve fought all the way to where you are, what did you feel? What happened to you when you decided to stand against Celes-sama? Lyle-sama, have you ever thought over what would happen if you actually achieved peace? If you do, what awaits is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Miranda entered the room. She had Valkyries with her, and she headed for Novem as she drew closer to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>In that dimly lit room, with the light of the window to her back, it looked as if Miranda\u2019s eyes were glowing in the shadows. This was a different sort of scary.</p><br/><p>Novem slowly turned around, as she looked at her fingers digging into my shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-my deepest apologies, Lyle-sama! I\u2019ll heal it up at once. But I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She seemed on the verge of tears, but she was trying to tell me something. Miranda entered, and pulled Novem away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the healing. Novem, get out of here. We\u2019ll hear you out once you cool your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Surrounded by Valkyries, Novem left the room. Hanging her head, the words she muttered\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What waits in a world of peace is a gentle demise.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

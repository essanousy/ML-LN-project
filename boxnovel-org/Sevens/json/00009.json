Its hair grew to mask its back.</p><br/><p>The ogre-like orc swung around the large sword that had once belonged to the adventurer it killed.</p><br/><p>When wielded by the beast, it simply seemed to be a normal sized sword.</p><br/><p>Perhaps trying to threaten me as I raised my sabre towards it, the monster let out a roar.</p><br/><p>Around me were the comrades I challenged this labyrinth with. Novem, Aria, Zelphy-san, Rondo-san, Rachel-san\u2026 the five of them flinched for a moment upon hearing the war cry.</p><br/><p>I mean, it was just that loud.</p><br/><p>Now that the orc was in it, the room that had a bit ow width to it started to feel exceedingly narrow.</p><br/><p>But I was able to comprehend the orc\u2019s current condition to some extent.</p><br/><p>(I can see why the Seond hesitated to let my use it. In a sense, this is truly too powerful.)</p><br/><p>To put it bluntly, its original effect of being a Skill to allow others the use of Skills\u2026 was a lesser power than its indirect effect.</p><br/><p>As if they were summoned forth by the red orc\u2019s scream, the monsters loitering around the dungeon began to gather around the room we were in.</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san stood up in front of me.</p><br/><p>No, she was holding up her shield, so she was probably taking on the role of a Shield for the entire party.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that in order to oppose this red orc, I don\u2019t think Zelphy-san\u2019s power is sufficient.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take on this red one. You guys take care of the other ones pouring into the room.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that to all, Rondo-san raised his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying!? That enemy\u2019s not normal. It would be best if we all went at it at once!\u201d</p><br/><p>While that definitely was a plausible opinion, this wasn\u2019t the time to be delaying action against the monster in front of us.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d love that too, but we don\u2019t really have the time\u2026 look, they\u2019re coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, Goblins started to enter the room.</p><br/><p>As they sprung up from behind the orc, Novem used her magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Bullet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Goblins were sent sprawling in the air, and they collided with a wall.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I pulled out my spare sabre, and started running off towards the red orc.</p><br/><p>It lifted up the blade in its hands, and lowered it at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is quite a Skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Using my momentum, I leaned down and leapt. The falling blade pierced into the ground behind me.</p><br/><p>I ended up in the space between the orc and its weapons.</p><br/><p>Using the sabres in both of my hands, I cut at the red orc\u2019s knees.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo shallow? More so that I thought\u2026 no.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was considering whether the orc\u2019s skin was harder than I had expected, I saw his knees healing before me.</p><br/><p>I immediately jumped to his left, as his left fist hit the ground where I was, and gouged it out. A small crater was formed.</p><br/><p>As I rolled to stand from my lunge, a voice called out to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-kun!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Rondo-san\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Seeing the goblin coming at me from my back, he quickly raised his voice.</p><br/><p>Without turning around, I stuck my sabre behind, and stood.</p><br/><p>Goblin blood starts raining down on my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I muttered that, a few reacted by rushing over to me.</p><br/><p>It was Novem, Aria and Zelphy-san.</p><br/><p>Also, seeing a good opportunity, the monsters around started to aim at me.</p><br/><p>I swung my two swords, and turned as I moved around the room.</p><br/><p>Every time I swung my swords, blood spattered onto the ground.</p><br/><p>As I finally used my sleeve to wipe my eyes, I was able to confirm the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo even when blinded, I can do this much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Using my blades, I had dodged and cut down the monsters that came at me.</p><br/><p>Where everyone was, and what sort of condition they were in\u2026 that was the Second\u2019s Skill that could let me perceive all my surroundings. It differed from the Fifth and Sixth\u2019s Skill in an essential point.</p><br/><p>The Fifth spoke with some nostalgia.</p><br/><p>\u300eI was under this Skill\u2019s care quite a bit, but as I thought, the side effect is the more amazing part of it. My Skill gives you a much larger view, and it\u2019s not suited for these sorts of melee battles, though.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. It\u2019s plain, but quite proficient. There were quite a few campaigns I lived through simply because I had the First and Second Generations\u2019 skills.\u300f</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry if you wanted to reminisce a little, but I\u2019d really like some advice on how to defeat the enemy in front of me right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that attacks don\u2019t work, but it looks like it\u2019s healing. If you continued attacking it, it\u2019d eventually run out of Mana and collapse, but\u2026 it feels like my stamina will run out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it were only me, I think I would manage one way or another, but right now, I have comrades.</p><br/><p>The first ones to collapse will probably be Rachel-san, who was keeping the room light, or Novem, who was using offensive magic to support me after having healed all the adventurers herself.</p><br/><p>After that, Aria will probably fall, and then perhaps Zelphy-san.</p><br/><p>Finally, maybe even Rondo-san won\u2019t be able to defeat this orc.</p><br/><p>(Because it defeated a veteran adventurer to experience a growth, it\u2019s gotten even more troublesome. So monsters can grow, and get Skills as well\u2026 was the fact that it was a grace from god to man a lie?)</p><br/><p>I lowered my eyes to the sabres in both of my hands, and retreated back. In front of me, the orc\u2019s sword was lowered.</p><br/><p>It looks like it doesn\u2019t know how to handle a sword.</p><br/><p>With this, it may have actually been better if it kept the cudgel.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe chipping on the sabres is quite bad. My weapons will be ruined first. If I were to take it out in one blow, would magic strengthened by Skills be best?\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to reach a conclusion in my mind, but I felt it wasn\u2019t quite sufficient.</p><br/><p>Since the others were taking on the monsters flooding into the room, it\u2019ll take some time before I\u2019ll be able to seek help from them.</p><br/><p>Since it was taking me on, the red orc wasn\u2019t attacking the others. If someone did come to my assistance, perhaps it would change its target.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really hate gambling, though\u2026 well then, how should I take it out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With my strongest attack, I have to somehow take down this monster in one strike.</p><br/><p>I need to determine what Skill it has, and I can perceive a majority of my surroundings with the Second\u2019s Skill. Stamina and Mana\u2026 Since I can sense those sort of things intuitively now, my fighting style has to change to match that.</p><br/><p>The First\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, isn\u2019t your (The Second Generation) skill a bit too cowardly?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe hell you mean by cowardly!? It\u2019s a convenient Skill! It was so convenient that he might start relying on it, so I didn\u2019t let Lyle use it yet is all!\u300f</p><br/><p>It felt like I had ganed some new senses, but it feels like using them all will take too much time.</p><br/><p>I felt that not my Mana, but my mental fatigue would catch up to me.</p><br/><p>I continued to dodge the red\u2019s attacks, as I thought.</p><br/><p>There, the red orc ominously retreated a step. It raised its voice, and from the room\u2019s walls\u2026 the gaps between the trees, a normal emerald-skinned orc appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one summoned allies!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria raised a surprised voice, and Rondo-san approached Rachel-san in order to protect her.</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san also stood in front of Novem and Aria.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle, how long do we have to hold out!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zelphy-san\u2019s voice, I looked up, and thought for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be over soon, so please withstand it for a little while.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said that.</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, the First raised a loud laugh.</p><br/><p>\u300enice going there, Lyle! Right. At times like these, men have got to look cool! Good! I\u2019ll teach you something special\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>On the First\u2019s remark, the Fifth seemed a little agitated.</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, what are you thinking? It\u2019s much to soon, isn\u2019t it?\u300f</p><br/><p>For the two orcs that had appeared at the red ones sides, I temporarily activated Limit Vurst, and threw the sabres in my hands at them.</p><br/><p>They spun in the air before landing in their skulls.</p><br/><p>The two orcs opened their jaws at the impact, before collapsing on the ground.</p><br/><p>Seeing me lose my weapons, the red orc roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if I can take it out with magic\u2026 just barely, perhaps.\u201d</p><br/><p>I think it was possible, but just barely. There was also the possibility it wasn\u2019t enough, so I\u2019d have to bet it all on one hit.</p><br/><p>(If I can\u2019t beat it then, I can try striking it barehanded, I guess.)</p><br/><p>For a moment, I found it terribly strange for a First-like thought to be running across my mind.</p><br/><p>(What is this feeling\u2026 it isn\u2019t bad.)</p><br/><p>While I was thinking something like that, the First spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, clench the Jewel.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Those around were busy fighting monsters, so they probably won\u2019t hear my conversation with the First.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll teach you something fun. It\u2019ll be some good news for the current you\u2026 I mean, you\u2019ll be able to use the trick the Seventh personally went and set up.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seventh\u2026 my grandfather?\u201d</p><br/><p>I put using magic on hold, and gripped the Jewel as told.</p><br/><p>The Seventh began yelling at the First.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhy did you tell him!? It\u2019s too soon! With Lyle\u2019s Mana, he really will only be able to maintain it for a few seconds!\u300f</p><br/><p>The First shot back.</p><br/><p>\u300eSeconds? That\u2019s more than enough, ain\u2019t it!? You guys, to this one\u2026 who\u2019s the one that said Lyle was amazing!? I approved of him! No one\u2019s going to be getting in my way! Now let\u2019s go, Lyle!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Jewel gave off a blue light, and the chain wrapped around my neck was arbitrarily undone.</p><br/><p>The silver ornaments enveloping the stone started to cange shape in my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It looks like the others were curious about my situation as well. With a blast of magic from Novem, the area was covered in smoke.</p><br/><p>Feeling a weight like never before from the Jewel, the item that it once was\u2026 no, I gripped the silver ornaments I thought to be nothing bur accents to grace the Jwewl.</p><br/><p>I gripped the handle in both hands, and the silver blade let off a pale light. A guard with the blue stone embedded in it\u2026 the Jewel shined.</p><br/><p>\u300eMy sword skills are none too splendid. So these sorts of striking weapons are best for me.\u300f</p><br/><p>What my hands had grasped was a thick silver sword.</p><br/><p>The First cried out.</p><br/><p>\u300eThere\u2019s no time, right!? On with it already!!\u300f</p><br/><p>As if the voice was pushing me forward, I dashed forward, and took a large jump. I turned my body to avoid the red orc\u2019s lowering sword, and used the weight of the large sword in my own hand to rotate from the momentum.</p><br/><p>With the centrifugal force as my ally, I used my Skills to momentarily raise my power output to its limit.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is my final Skill\u2026 it\u2019s \u3010Full Burst\u3011!\u300f</p><br/><p>Perhaps through the First\u2019s support, as I activated the Skills, a power greater than usual surged up from within my body.</p><br/><p>I took control of the spin, and lowered the maximized power onto the red orc\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>My voice overlapped with his.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the end!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s the end!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The orc tried to sacrifice its left arm to survive, but the arm it used as a Shield was cut clean through.</p><br/><p>My blade pierced deep into the ground, and the caved in earth around the impact spoke to the blow\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026 hah\u2026 how brutal.\u201d</p><br/><p>After I confirmed the two parts of the orc\u2019s body slowly fall to the ground, the silver sword changed itself back to a simple ornament.</p><br/><p>(He said the Seventh had it specialy made, but\u2026 come to think of it, Zell did say it had a rare metal put into it.)</p><br/><p>Recalling the words Zell imparted onto me when I was driven out, I started to wish that they had just told me about it sooner.</p><br/><p>But through a sudden depletion of Mana, I couldn\u2019t put any power into my body.</p><br/><p>My knees hit the ground, and the one propping up my body\u2026 Novem was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem clung to me, and perhaps out of her genuine worrt, she was squeezing quite strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahaha, sorry\u2026 I pushed myself a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san also ran over, and sought confirmation from me.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what was it you did? And that glowing weapon\u2026 oy, wait! Don\u2019t collapse in a place like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san was quite rowdy, but that was the same as always, so I felt a little relieved. Nearby, I saw Rondo-san had been injured, but Rachel-san was busy treating him.</p><br/><p>Aria looked to be out of breath, but she had used her Skills to defeat the monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease quiet down! Lyle-sama, let\u2019s get out of here quickly. Do you think your consciousness can hold on for that long?\u201d</p><br/><p>So we either took a short break here, or get out immediately.</p><br/><p>But if I feel the same as always, it doesn\u2019t look like I underwent a Growth.</p><br/><p>I hated that.</p><br/><p>I wanted to show some obstinacy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. If I rest for a little, I\u2019ll soon be able to stand\u2026 Novem, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem seemed relieved, but she continued to support up my body. To Aria, who drew closer, I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you were able to win against monsters. Are you a little more confident, now?\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried teasing her a little, but she gave a surprised response.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 were watching?\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps she took it as praise, but she was unexpectedly happy.</p><br/><p>(Aria, perhaps you\u2019re the type that gets fooled too easily. You should be careful\u2026 more importantly\u2026)</p><br/><p>I looked at Rondo\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for arbitrarily taking action on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rachel-san let out a sigh. Rondo-san had his injuries wrapped with bandages, but he was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was amazing. I never thought you would be able to do that much. Idiotic Noble Son doesn\u2019t suit you, Lyle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his unrelenting smile, I thought that perhaps he was quite a broadminded person. He directs a smile to the younger adventurer that went off on his own.</p><br/><p>But Rachel-san was different.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way too free-willed. It turned out fine this time, but just look at yourself. Be more conscious of the fact that you have people who\u2019ll weep for you if you died, and wait, I wanted to say this, but I didn\u2019t get the chance, so let me give you an honest apology here. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I honestly didn\u2019t get the feeling that I was actually receiving thanks, but I guess she was showing consideration in her own way.</p><br/><p>I smiled sarcastically.</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san told me not to put up a front, and to worry about myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were saved because of you, Lyle, but please trust the others a little more. What they are and aren\u2019t capable of, if you had taken that into account, perhaps you could have moved more efficiently. I can understand your feelings of wanting to conceal your Skill, but please give out at least a little information on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about if that was really the case, I started considering whether or not to bring up the ancestors.</p><br/><p>(First, I have to tell Novem. I have plenty of things I have to let her know. Like about the First Generation\u2026)</p><br/><p>A Barbaric man who didn\u2019t worry about the details. Who moved on instinct, and stirred up his surroundings.</p><br/><p>But he was the reliable founder of the Walt House.</p><br/><p>(I wonder if he\u2019s recognized me.)</p><br/><p>I gripped the Jewel as I thought that. Novem opened her eyes wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe gem is shining\u2026 this is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem said that, the others also gave a surprised reaction.</p><br/><p>What floated up in my head was the name of a Skill.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u3010Experience\u3011.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the name that came up.</p><br/><p>Just what sort of things it could do, and how it could be used.</p><br/><p>They all came to me at once.</p><br/><p>Since it first manifested, it took quite a while for my Skill to take definite shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, that means\u2026 you, just how many Skills can you use?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria was astonished, but more than that, it was the contents of the Skill that shocked me.</p><br/><p>I mean, my Skill was Support Class, and it seems it was perpetually active.</p><br/><p>I thought the reason I was getting fatigued so easily was because of the ancestors, but it seems that one of the contributing factors was my own incomplete Skill.</p><br/><p>(A Skill that lets you obtain a lot of experience? \u2026 What\u2019s more, it\u2019s perpetually active, so that means it\u2019s constantly expending my Mana.)</p><br/><p>When it was still incomplete, it looks like it didn\u2019t display its intended effect, but it still drained up my Mana regardless.</p><br/><p>And here, I finally was able to learn its effect, but\u2026</p><br/><p>(Isn\u2019t my Skill just a little to vague!!?)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After the break.</p><br/><p>We took three cycles to take the five injured adventurers out of the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>The support person who was acting as our coachman filled our stomachs with the soup he prepared, and after that, we wandered over to the deepest chamber.</p><br/><p>As long as the core\u2026 treasure remained in the deepest chamber, the labyrinth would continue to grow, and monsters would continue to emerge.</p><br/><p>To avoid any further danger, collecting the treasure was a necessity.</p><br/><p>As we entered the room, Rahu-san noticed a glowing metal stick in the space between trees.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that is!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He ran ahead, and cut away the branches entwined around it, before taking it out.</p><br/><p>As he did that, the harsh breathing conditions were suddenly resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, the labyrinth has been cleared. There was only one floor, so it was easy, but if it had grown to three or four, it would have been impossible with these numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The metal in his hands looked like iron.</p><br/><p>But it was a special iron that had been soaked in the magic of the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooh! If you make this into a weapon, it becomes a Magic Tool you can grant Skills unto, right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rahu-san sought confirmation of that fact from Zelphy-san in high spirits, and she nodded with a bitter smile on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you bring it to a craftsman in Dalien, you could make a few with half of that, I think. But make sure you choose a guild certified dealer.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s none too pleasant if these sorts of metals start flowing along the underground routes.</p><br/><p>\u201cRahu, we\u2019ll have to evenly divide the reward. Since there are seven of us, should we make seven parts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rahu-san drew closer to Rondo-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I buy off the other portions!? As long as we have this, then we\u2019ll be able to carry Magic Tools as well. In that case, we can even start challenging other labyrinths as adventurers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rahu looked to be in high spirits as he expressed his desire to turn the treasure in his hands into a Magic Tool. But looking at the amount of metal, the amount that could be made was around three to four items.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have that sort of money. Let\u2019s build it up steadily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rondo-san let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>With this amount, just how many gold coins would that take?</p><br/><p>As I thought that, I noticed Zelphy-san\u2019s eyes were pointed at a corner of the room.</p><br/><p>I looked there as well.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He was an acquaintance, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Zelpht0san called out to her, she mumbled some affirming words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was quite the willful bastard. After saying that death was the end of it so many times, in the end, he threw out his own life to save some newcomers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Making acomplicated expression, she approached the veteran adventurer\u2019s corpse, and began looking through his belongings.</p><br/><p>She piled up everything that seemed to have value, and finally recovered his guild card.</p><br/><p>From my point of view, it looked like roadside robbery.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you guys come closer too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, we\u2026 me, Novem and Aria, approached the corpse.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because he was beaten to death with a blunt weapon, the body was in quite a bad state.</p><br/><p>Novem held her hand to her mouth, and Aria\u2019s face turned pale as she assumed a crouching position.</p><br/><p>I covered my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember this. The death of an adventurer is something like this. In the end, everything of value is picked off, and the corpse is cast away. Make sure you don\u2019t forget to collect the guild card, and deliver it to the guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>An end stripped of all worth.</p><br/><p>Saying that, Zelphy-san took out a leather bag she didn\u2019t usually use, and she started carefully putting the veteran adventurer\u2019s belongings in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cZelphy, it\u2019s not like you have to go that \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria had a pale face and a shortness of breath, but Zelphy-san didn\u2019t heed her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my right. I ventured to a dangerous region, and confirmed the corpse. I even conducted an investigation into what exactly happened here. Where is the problem in that?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she glared at Aria, Zelphy-san seemed quite different from usual.</p><br/><p>Rondo-san\u2019s group didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, the recovery has ended. Let\u2019s return, and get some well-deserved rest. Also big guy over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Zelphy-san\u2019s words, Rahu-san pointed to himself. He was holding the precious metal under his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy portion\u2019s settled with this man\u2019s stuff. Go negotiate the rest with Lyle\u2019s group on your own. They\u2019re still newbies, so you may be able to cheat them out of it quite easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, Zelphy-san turned to leave. Aria had a sad expression as she watched her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the things that happened in my House, Zelphy-san turned out like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the adventurer\u2019s form, Aria was sorrowful.</p><br/><p>I looked after Novem, and handed Aria the water flask for her parched mouth.</p><br/><p>If you die, you\u2019re thrown away. Those alive will take everything of value.</p><br/><p>She showed us such a precedent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, it\u2019s about time we left.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, Aria looked over the corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, a burial\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Rondo-san explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a short while, this labyrinth will wither away. Everything here will rot away, so whether you bury him or not, it will all be the same. Or could it be you plan on shouldering that corpse all the way out of here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria mournfully looked at the ground.</p><br/><p>And Rondo-san continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better you treasure those feelings. They may be na\u00efve, but before being adventurers, we are all human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rondo-san left the area, and Rahu-san tailed behind him. His parting words\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s negotiate it out later. Oh, I don\u2019t intend on cheating you guys, mind you. It\u2019s just that we simply don\u2019t have too much on is\u2026 sorry, that wasn\u2019t something for me to say at a time like this. At this rate, I can\u2019t scold Rachel for her loose tongue.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemd he was going to use the opportunity to say something, but sensing it was impossible, he left the chamber.</p><br/><p>I offered my hands to Novem and Aria, and supported them as we walked.</p><br/><p>There, the Fourth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eFlanked by two beauties\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Spouted out some words filled with hatred. Hearing that, the Third laughed.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019ve got good luck, Lyle. That\u2019s quite an important thing, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>And the Sixth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, let\u2019s be off now. That Zelphy just went through great pains to show you guys a taste of reality. Think about her feelings too.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing those words, I felt the urge to tilt my head.</p><br/><p>(Zelphy-san\u2019s feelings?)</p><br/><p>The Second let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u300eGood grief\u2026 it seems she really intends to leave this Noble Lady to Lyle. She even put up those theatrics.\u300f</p><br/><p>The ancestors said that that display from before was an act, but I wasn\u2019t able to understand their meaning.</p><br/><p>(Really intends to leave? What do you mean by that?)</p><br/><p>Supporting the two of them, I headed towards the exit to the labyrinth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t get any closer. Someone save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>The day after Lyle had been fooled by Miranda.</p><br/><p>The room behind the office you could call his private room had been firmly locked up.</p><br/><p>Saying he didn\u2019t want to go to the inner palace anymore, when night came, Lyle tried to spend it in his office. Then came Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be fine. I will never try to deceive you, Lyle-sama. I merely came to tell you fair and square that I\u2019ve finished with my preparations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA girl shouldn\u2019t be saying such things! I, even after all that\u2019s happened, I still have dreams of women! Please believe me. My fantasies\u2026 please let me see the dreams I dream! I want to stay deceived! I don\u2019t want to know the truth! The truth\u2026 it all does naught but hurt the hearts of man!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lured to the inner palace by Miranda, she went and had his way with him.</p><br/><p>And today he had lamented, \u201cThis isn\u2019t how I wanted it to be!\u201d But Novem smiled as she shook her head to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, I\u2019m sure you already understand. And once you know, there is no turning back. Now come to the inner palace with me. If it\u2019s dreams you desire, I\u2019ll show you as many as you want on the bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem snapped her fingers, the Valkyries flooded in.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you all!? Why are you cooperating with Novem? I thought you were hostile to her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Representing the Valkyries, one unit stepped forward. From the pink ribbon fastening her hair, he could tell it was Unit Seventy One.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The enemy of an enemy is a friend. If it will free our master from that scrap heap called Monica, then we will become that which goes bump in the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lyle was driven to the far wall, he tried to call for allies.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh! There\u2019s no helping it. I can only rely on\u2026 Moni\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you call her, Monica isn\u2019t coming. I already entrusted it to Baldoir and some Valkyries to apprehend her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem had first dealt with the troublesome Monica. Lyle was cornered.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-wait I just want to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle tried to get away by any means, but subdued by Valkyries and lifted up, he began his move towards the Inner Palace.</p><br/><p>Novem smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the time it takes for us to reach my mansion, I\u2019ll hear out everything you want to say. It\u2019s alright. I\u2019ve already prepared the food and the bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>(I-I have to run. I have to get away!)</p><br/><p>Even lifted up by the Valkyries, Lyle squirmed. The wire that bound him seemed to be custom-made, and it didn\u2019t tear so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so you\u2019ll be resting in my mansion. Don\u2019t worry. You just have to lay down, and I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a man, I can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, in that case, do your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nothing he said would liberate him. Fully understanding that, Lyle stopped resisting and fell limp. Along the way, they passed by Baldoir who confirmed his state.</p><br/><p>Lyle looked at Baldoir, begging for salvation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, Baldoir!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, I\u2019ll get your office back in order for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle watched Baldoir\u2019s back as he left the area.</p><br/><p>(Kuh! That man pursues the interests of the empire more than my interests as an individual. He isn\u2019t wrong. He isn\u2019t wrong, but\u2026 if this is how it\u2019s going to be, I\u2019ll use the authority of the empire to find him a new partner.)</p><br/><p>As he thought that, Lyle arrived at a place under strict security.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the gate guarded by two Valkyrie units lay Lyle\u2019s inner palace. No, the inner palace prepared for the emperor.</p><br/><p>A small town lay inside the castle.</p><br/><p>It was surely a bizarre sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking something like this\u2026 that\u2019s why I was opposed!\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Novem made it clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a necessary measure. In essence, it\u2019s your fault for not laying a hand no matter how much time passed. You understand the worry of those around, do you not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh! I can\u2019t refute that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Form the eyes of those around, he only associated with Maksim and Damien, a biased sample, and as jokes didn\u2019t get through to Baldoir, Lyle had ended up relying on Monica.</p><br/><p>The wimp part of him still persisted. At the point he turned to Monica, those around already experienced quite a sense of panic.</p><br/><p>Lyle had noticed how restless Baldoir had become.</p><br/><p>(But just getting right to it without any preparations is no good, right!? So it\u2019s my bad for trying to at least get the knowledge alone!? It\u2019s my fault!?)</p><br/><p>As he entered the inner palace, Lyle looked around. There, he saw a single building with a sheet draped over it.</p><br/><p>(Huh? That\u2019s strange? I got a report saying the inner palace was completed, but are they still constructing something?)</p><br/><p>Perhaps it really wasn\u2019t completed, or they had decided to construct something new, Lyle Thought as he arrived at the most splendid estate of the inner palace.</p><br/><p>As the official empress, Novem\u2019s mansion was constructed especially large. There was an order in place, and the splendor of the mansions had a ranking to them as well.</p><br/><p>But even the smallest mansion, from Lyle\u2019s point of view, was plenty big enough.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s needlessly large.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, the Valkyries released Lyle and lowered him onto the floor. Novem turned to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then. Lyle-sama. Would you like a meal? Or a bath? Or perhaps\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face flushed, Novem wouldn\u2019t put the rest to mouth. And yet Lyle folded his arms and gave a normal reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite famished, so a meal would be nice. Rather, you said you already prepared it, and I doubt it will taste the same once it\u2019s gone cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem made a dubious face; the surrounding Valkyries shook as they contained their laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-then come into my mansion. The preparations are in order.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA mansion in a castle, rather a whole town? This definitely feels strange. I heard there are stalls and shops running in the plaza.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle looked over the inner palace once more. Novem\u2019s mansion alone was built on a higher point than the others, so he could look over it in its entirety.</p><br/><p>Novem smiled as she answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNormally, the women who enter here\u2026 the empress and mistresses don\u2019t go out without reason. The stalls are geared towards attendants and maids. The shops are the same. Well, with a small town here, the children will be able to learn quite a bit, I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing of children, Lyle imagined the sights of his own children running around. Thinking of that, it was an amazing environment.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 No, do we really need it? They could just go outside like a normal person. Why did we have to build something like this?)</p><br/><p>\u201cLimited to women, there are places songs and the like are performed as well. Just a little while ago, one of Eva\u2019s acquaintances was performing a song and a play\u2026 they came in from Zayin, so it was a performance of the Holy Knight and the Holy Maiden, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle could tell Novem\u2019s atmosphere had changed a bit, as he was urged to enter the mansion in haste. And what awaited was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI prepared some food to give you strength. I made over half of it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of the various dishes lining the large table, they were all to build stamina, a majority of them quite thick.</p><br/><p>The taste looked thick too. Just looking at them was enough for Lyle\u2019s hunger to feel sated. Of all else, thinking of what was to come, there were definitely some expectations placed on him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 T-thank you for the meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, dig in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Novem\u2019s smile, there was no way he could decline, so Lyle dived into the food. In his head, the face of the Fifth Generation head of his House floated up. The Fifth made a knowing face.</p><br/><p>\u300eGood luck.\u300f</p><br/><p>He seemed to say.</p><br/><p>(Fifth\u2026 harems really are nothing but trouble. If this was how it was going to be, I\u2019d have preferred being an adventurer.)</p><br/><p>Second Generation Head (\uff1b\u30fb\u2200\u30fb): \u201cBoys are those that always dream. That\u2019s why, that\u2019s why\u2026 harems must by fluffy, with the sweet taste of candy, or it\u2019s no good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation Head ( \u309c\u2200\u309c): \u201cHarem stories are no good if they can\u2019t give dreams to the good girls and boys! I\u2019m worried that Lyle may dry up lol.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

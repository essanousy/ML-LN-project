The acceptance time range is four days. Just by participating, the reward is two silver. The contents say they just have to stand at a designated point?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was natural for him to doubt it.</p><br/><p>The payment and the job level were completely out of sync.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no issue. Also, about the number of people we\u2019ll be taking on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Yes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hawkins-san looked troubled, as he confirmed the numbers written on the form.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve the funds to reward up to two hundred, though. In essence, our goal\u2026 is just to get them to stand around the entrance of an abandoned mine. Also, I\u2019ll pay the reward separately, and search for people on my own as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Hawkins-san confirmed the details of the documents again and again.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf it\u2019s just as our intel stated, then it\u2019s twenty or over. Even if you call it overkill, the only one moving will be Lyle. Well, if you think of it as participating in a war, it isn\u2019t a bad earning.\u300f</p><br/><p>As the Third Generation said that, I experienced some vague feelings.</p><br/><p>(Working one day afforded me around six to ten large copper coins. Even so, we\u2019re giving out two silver for a two day job. Still, if we don\u2019t do at least that much, we won\u2019t get a flood of applicants.)</p><br/><p>\u300eThose blinded by money will flock. Let\u2019s do it with a bang, why don\u2019t we?\u300f</p><br/><p>Still as an idiot son, though.</p><br/><p>Subjugating a few tens of thieves with hundreds must appear as a quite a joke to the residents of Dalien.</p><br/><p>That would definitely send my location to the Walt house\u2026 my family would definitely learn it. Of course, the possibility they already had was high.</p><br/><p>But if I carried out foolish acts of this level, what would they think of it?</p><br/><p>I really would be getting assassinated some day or another.</p><br/><p>(If it\u2019s by Celes\u2019s whim, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for something like that to happen.)</p><br/><p>Then after this joke\u2026 this idiotic brat\u2019s struggle, what would happen then?</p><br/><p>(In the end, this is all a gamble, isn\u2019t it\u2026)</p><br/><p>As Hawkins-san was making sure there were no deficiencies in the paperwork, I added on another thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. I wanted to ask you something, Hawkins-san, if that would be alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. As long as it\u2019s something I can answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I confirmed it with him.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zelphy-san had no complaints.</p><br/><p>There was no way the guild would deny the request.</p><br/><p>(Because it\u2019s always better to have more cards to play.)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In front of the Guild\u2019s first floor.</p><br/><p>In the space where hoards of people came and went, I made an address in a loud voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Walt House\u2019s\u2026 the former heir of a Count House! On this occasion, I am standing to eliminate the bandits that have made a nest near Dalien! Anyone who believes my cause is just, please volunteer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, your voice is too soft. You can laugh if you want, so just make it dramatic here.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth Generation directed me, as I loudly publicized the operation.</p><br/><p>Ridiculously.</p><br/><p>I even invited some laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cA noble\u2019s bringing down bandits?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd wait, wasn\u2019t he driven out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that because he\u2019s no good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust leave whatever bandit problems to the lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the labyrinth\u2019s over with, they\u2019ll be back soon enough. We just have to hold out until then.\u201d</p><br/><p>While laughing sarcastically, the adventurers passed me by.</p><br/><p>There were some that openly guffawed as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow is time to stand, and as knights, our mission is\u2026 (I-it\u2019s time to get desperate!)\u201d</p><br/><p>I endured the embarrassment and continued to call out to them.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After I finished my petitioning, I met up with Novem and returned to our rented house.</p><br/><p>In front of the entrance-way, a red-haired woman\u2026 Aria Lockwarde, was standing menacingly with her arms crossed.</p><br/><p>Her folded arms were propping up her breasts.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t much different than usual, but today, I was mentally worn out, so I took a fleeting glance at her chest before posing the inevitable question.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 do you have some business with our house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that business nonsense! Just what was that thing from earlier today!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Thing\u2019 likely referred to my grand advertising.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, well, the reward for subjugating bandits\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama was amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I became embarrassed from Novem\u2019s flattery, Lockwarde-san approached me.</p><br/><p>Her long strides were not something I would think would come from a noble lady.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was only asking you to lend me Zelphy-san! As long as you did that, I\u2019d make use of some connections and gather an elite few to reclaim the gem\u2026 if you let it out so openly, then even the Bandit Brigade will hear about it, will they not!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t misunderstanding something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what? I mean, in truth, everyone was making fun of that performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>I acted exactly for that sake.</p><br/><p>Though it was not a mistake\u2026 but for some reason, I felt sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason we took action was precisely because we had our own reasons. Or could it be\u2026 you were under the impression we were taking action for your sake?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Novem\u2019s harsh words, Lockwarde-san winced.</p><br/><p>I heard the First Generation\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eU-um Novem-chan\u2026 If possible, I\u2019d like you to forgive her, is what I think. Let\u2019s all be friends, okay?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u300eJust whose side is this guy on? There\u2019s no particular reason to keep her in a pleasant mood, is there? We\u2019ll be doing the same regardless.\u300f</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that my objective was to retrieve the Lockwarde House\u2019s gem.</p><br/><p>Those were the conditions I needed to clear to gain the First\u2019s assistance.</p><br/><p>However, my personal feelings of wanting to help her weren\u2019t particularly meager.</p><br/><p>This time around, the reason the ancestors were working together was to get the First to recognize me and to guarantee my own safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-but there\u2019s no meaning if the bandit troupe takes flight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then how about you take action?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem continued to speak to her coldly. At the same time, her argument was quite sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cZelphy-san accepted a guild request to act as our adviser. Of course, we already paid the appropriate compensation for that. Right now, we\u2019ve entrusted another job to her, but we\u2019ve properly paid the request fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I do feel truly sorry for that. But I don\u2019t have that sort of sum to pay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lockwarde-san\u2019s house was in decline. No, it collapsed.</p><br/><p>If they could muster up a large enough sum, they wouldn\u2019t be relying on their old friend Zelphy-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout doing whatever you can accomplish, why must you continue to find fault in Lyle-sama\u2019s work? Or could it be that if Lyle-sama succeeds, you plan to demand the gem from him? Just how selfish must you be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cE-even I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Lockwarde-san\u2019s mortified face, I tried to insert myself between the two, but the Third put a stop to that.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, how about you leave this one to Novem-chan? That will be best for that Aria girl\u2019s sake as well.\u300f</p><br/><p>He stopped my stopping. Novem confirmed my lack of action, before she continued to berate Lockwarde-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if they\u2019re laughed at, even if they\u2019re carrying shame, I wouldn\u2019t laugh at someone who was giving it their all. I think that those who merely watch from the sidelines are unqualified to say something about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lockwarde-san also tried countering.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I properly sought out assistance\u2026 what do you expect me to do alone!? What are you saying a little girl like me can do!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the two of them.</p><br/><p>The Third Generation offered me some advice.</p><br/><p>\u300eNovem-chan took it upon herself to play the villain in your place. Originally, that was something you\u2019d have to say to her, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>The First also told me.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right! Get a grip on yourself, ya\u2019 bastard!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second offered the First a friendly reminder.</p><br/><p>\u300eDo you comprehend that we\u2019re doing all this troublesome stuff because of you? And wait, try repeating whatever you just said in front of a mirror.\u300f</p><br/><p>In front of me, Lockwarde-san burst out crying and tears streamed down her face. The strong-willed demeanor she carried up until just before was nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>She wanted her precious things back.</p><br/><p>But doing that alone was impossible.</p><br/><p>She probably agonized over it, and I understood her impatience.</p><br/><p>I pulled Novem into the house. As we passed by Lockwarde-san, I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re departing tomorrow morning. If you happen to catch sight of a group on standby outside the entrance, that\u2019s the bandit subjugation force. Do whatever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I entered the house, taking Novem by the hand.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The morning of the next day.</p><br/><p>I looked at the gathered carts, wooden poles, and boards, and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s this, there\u2019ll be no misunderstandings when seen from afar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eFumu, I\u2019m surprised you got this much together with so little time. The merchants seemed to be quite wary of it as well.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh looked at those packed into the carts and confirmed the completion of our preparations.</p><br/><p>These were the gathered adventurers\u2026 with all one hundred and thirty spread out, it looked like an army from afar.</p><br/><p>(There are a few others here too.)</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 That Aria girl\u2019s here too.\u300f</p><br/><p>I shifted my eyes and found the red-haired Lockwarde-san.</p><br/><p>Seeing her, Novem didn\u2019t say a word. She didn\u2019t say anything, but she seemed a little relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure it wouldn\u2019t be best for her sake if she didn\u2019t come?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, Novem shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe had that sort of personality from the start. I think she began to feel regret. From that regret, perhaps she lost went down the wrong path\u2026 though it\u2019s just my arbitrary predictions.\u201d</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t have any work for a majority of the personnel. We seriously just hired them to head to the destination point. Those with actual work were less than ten percent of those present.</p><br/><p>It was a job where they truly just had to stand there. I advertised it as such, and that was why they gathered en masse.</p><br/><p>Naturally, we didn\u2019t have time, so the numbers we gathered were smaller than I thought.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou understand, right, Lyle? The war has already begun.\u300f</p><br/><p>On the Seventh Generation\u2019s words, I silently nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s depart.\u201d</p><br/><p>And on my words, Novem nodded as well.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>An abandoned mine near Dalien\u2026</p><br/><p>There, with his gathered treasure to his back, a single man sat on top of a wooden box.</p><br/><p>In his hand was a red gem.</p><br/><p>Gazing at the treasure in his right hand, the man smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten my hands on something nice. Because of this, I was able to cleanly sweep out all the monsters that had stuck themselves to this area.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had grown a scraggly beard, and he was a largely built man, whose height had surpassed two meters.</p><br/><p>His twenty three subordinates looked at their leader and laughed to themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of our leader. Even so, I never thought a pampered noble brat would come at us head on.\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of his men said that, the large man let out some hearty laughter.</p><br/><p>In front of the twenty three, he informed them of the subjugation force.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter he\u2019d made such a grand show at the guild, of course they\u2019d come. What\u2019s more, without even knowing some of our men had infiltrated their ranks. Let them struggle all they want with their troops of clay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The information about Lyle\u2019s group had gotten through to them.</p><br/><p>Altogether, the man had twenty six men. Of them, three were among the adventurers in Dalien.</p><br/><p>They bought necessary supplies in town, and when they were making preparations to take them back to the main force, they got their hands on information about Lyle\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>From that info, they knew that a majority of those coming were adventurers toting cypress sticks and shields of wood\u2026 What\u2019s more, they were seen through as to not even having much skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey may be planning to surprise us with numbers and demand our surrender\u2026 but we can\u2019t have that, can we? We won\u2019t end in a place like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The large man had ambition.</p><br/><p>He wanted to leave behind the status of a bandit and lead a mercenary troupe.</p><br/><p>In the queue of legendary mercenaries who went on to become Feudal Lords, he aspired to stand alongside them.</p><br/><p>He had drifted into Dalien, and even made connections with the city\u2019s inhabitants. He slowly brought his own subordinates in and sold the treasure they collected to amass funds for their next plan.</p><br/><p>The reason they never plundered Dalien was so they could live the lives of mercenaries there from here on.</p><br/><p>And the card they needed to play to grant that desire had descended among them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as we have this gem, there\u2019s nothing to fear. If that green noble brat comes along, then we\u2019ll just take his head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader! The woman the kid has with him\u2019s quite the looker!\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of his subordinates said that, the large man smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see! After I\u2019ve tasted her, I\u2019ll let you guys have a bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, well thanks for that. She\u2019d had my interest since the time I saw her at the guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>The portion of the group that had infiltrated the guild kept themselves informed on Lyle\u2019s activity.</p><br/><p>They planned to use that to make their own names stand out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re practically coming to us to offer us a chance to raise our names. Men, put your spirit into it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bandit brigade boasted high morale.</p><br/><p>The reason was the red gem the man clenched.</p><br/><p>In it, various close-combat-specialized skills were recorded.</p><br/><p>It was the precious treasure handed down through the Lockwarde House for generations.</p><br/><p>\u2026 The brigade prepared, and lay in wait for Lyle to arrive.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

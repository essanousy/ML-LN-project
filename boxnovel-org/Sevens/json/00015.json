In the area map, ther was nothing but a single red dot shining right in front of me.</p><br/><p>The surrounding monsters had disappeared, and the yellow village boys were hurriedly leaving the area.</p><br/><p>The girl in highly exposing clothing had two characteristic horns atop her head.</p><br/><p>And from what I saw in the Fifth\u2019s memory, I surmised this was the quilin, May.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I tried to make an intimidating voice, she touched her short hair without showing much interest. She looked between me and the Jewel around my neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing really? A threat, at most. Despite how energetic they were, the second they met a strong foe, the contracted and huddled themselves into balls. With a bit of threatening, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll quiet down for a little while. And that\u2019s our job, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Job.</p><br/><p>As she said that word, May shrugged her shoulders, and gave a restrained smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m being serious here. I didn\u2019t have any mind to eat or kill them or anything. Even as I am, I\u2019m on the gentler side of my herd.\u201d</p><br/><p>While calling herself gentle, she continued to direct hostility at me. She didn\u2019t seem to think anything of having a weapon pointed her way.</p><br/><p>She put her right hand to her chest, and kept it there a while.</p><br/><p>Her left hand was brought to her hip, and she spoke as if proud of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes even like this, I\u2019m an ally of humanity, after all. I mean, I\u2019m quite indebt to them\u2026 now then, if you happen to know anything about it, I\u2019d appreciate you answered. Why is it my dear benefactor\u2019s presence is emanating from the blue gem you hang from your neck? And at the same time, slight as it may be, you give off a similar air as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lowering both her hands, she glared at me with narrowed eyes.</p><br/><p>As not to let any of my movements pass, her expression was serious.</p><br/><p>So I started by introducing myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Lyle Walt\u2026 Fredricks Walt\u2019s descendent. And this gem has recorded the Skill of the Fifth Generation Head of the house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps unsatisfied with my answer, she widened her legs, bent forward a little, and let a strong voice from her stomach.</p><br/><p>All she did was yell, but my body convulsed in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie! That\u2019s no \u3010Gem\u3011! There\u2019s no way a simple gem could let off such an elaborate presence. Right, you\u2026 you all must have locked Fredricks in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem my words were getting through, so I gripped the Jewel.</p><br/><p>The Fifth.</p><br/><p>\u300eMay, I wasn\u2019t sealed anywhere. I\u2019m already dead. You should already understand that\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>On the Fifth\u2019s strained voice, May responded.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, as I thought, it\u2019s Fredricks. He\u2019s grieving. That\u2019s why it\u2019s my turn to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she raised her right arm to the side, her clothing receded to reveal her hand. And as it appeared, a quilin horn sprouted from her palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy! You just heard his voice, didn\u2019t you!? Then if you can hear him, can\u2019t you\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, so it talks. I\u2019m starting to want it more and more. I mean, it\u2019s been a few decades since we last talked\u2026 back then, I didn\u2019t know that humans only lived a lifespan of fifty to sixty years. I was sure I could meet him again\u2026 but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her form instantly disappeared from my vision, and I immediately found myself staunched over.</p><br/><p>I was sent into the air by her right leg swiping at me from the air, and as I was falling towards the ground, her left leg sent me crashing into it.</p><br/><p>I rolled to gain distance, stood at once, and took a stance with the dagger.</p><br/><p>Despite my base specs being elevated by Skills, a strong enough blow could still knock me off my feet.</p><br/><p>With the horn growing from her right arm, May appeared right in front of me again, and slashed as if to cut me down.</p><br/><p>(This one\u2019s fighting style\u2026 is a bit like our house\u2019s.)</p><br/><p>Sparks flew from my dagger, and I felt an ominous sensation from it, so I leapt backward as she swung her right hand at me horizontally.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, you don\u2019t call yourself Fredricks\u2019 descendent for nothing. The way you move your body is reminiscent of his.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the dagger in my left hand, the part it had received the attack had chipped, with cracks spreading across the blade.</p><br/><p>If I had taken that blow, the dagger would have shattered, and I\u2019ll bet I\u2019d have been killed.</p><br/><p>From within the Jewel, the Third.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, don\u2019t her movements look\u2026 a bit like ours?\u300f</p><br/><p>To the Fifth, the Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300eCould it be you\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>He was quite upfront about it.</p><br/><p>\u300eI taught her. By the way, she knows full well the sorts of Skills I had. And I used the First\u2019s, Second\u2019s Third\u2019s, and Fourth\u2019s Skills to at least their primary levels.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou never properly taught me anything\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh sounded tired, but he did call out for my attention.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, it\u2019s that\u2026 it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t bring Novem or any of the others along.\u300f</p><br/><p>If I had, then past problems would just be brought up again. What\u2019s more, May seems to be under some sort of misunderstanding, so it\u2019s quite possible some strange topics would have been brought up.</p><br/><p>I returned my dagger to its sheath at my waist, and pulled my spare sabre.</p><br/><p>With a sabre in both hands, I slowly moved to use the forest terrain as best as I could.</p><br/><p>(She has me beat in power output? Though I think I\u2019ll be able to overwhelm her for a brief moment if I use the First\u2019s Full Burst\u2026)</p><br/><p>If I defeated this girl, I\u2019m sure the Fifth would fly into a fit of rage. No, there\u2019s no helping it, right? I really don\u2019t know how this fight will go.</p><br/><p>And I don\u2019t even want to fight a divine beast like a quilin.</p><br/><p>Even if they didn\u2019t contain magic stones, their flesh, blood, horns and scales went for a tremendous fortune, though.</p><br/><p>As May rushed in, I tried reading her movements, and parried her horn with a blade.</p><br/><p>(Maybe\u2026!)</p><br/><p>Both her speed and power were over mine. But May was weaker than Celes.</p><br/><p>Based on how I approached it, she was within the scope of enemies I could hold my ground against.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t seem aggravated at having her strike turned aside, merely coming to slash again.</p><br/><p>When I parried that one, she suddenly stopped in front of me, leaned forward, and did a handstand on only her left.</p><br/><p>She spread her legs out and spun, and taken aback, I instinctively used my arm to block it, and was sent flying backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you find that one interesting? When I did it on Fredricks, he dodged it quite easily\u2026 you\u2019re weak, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood, and felt a numbness in my arm as I took a stance.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a little growing up, and a child\u2019s speed and reach shoot straight up!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I refuted it, she looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hm~ so you know what form I took when I was with Fredricks. Did you hear the stories? No, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying it wasn\u2019t it, she jumped at me, and this time she used the trees and branches to maneuver around.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you see~ I\u2019m a quilin, right? Did you not think it possible I was more accustomed to the forest than you?\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned, and held my blades in a cross to block and turn aside her thrust.</p><br/><p>She had circled around, and aimed right at my heart. It doesn\u2019t seem she had any intentiions of going easy on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou react fast. You power\u2019s also something up there. Your Skills\u2026 nine? Ten? Seriously, what\u2019s up with that false gem of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>She jumped back and escaped into the foliage, I confirmed her position with Skills.</p><br/><p>She was running circles around, and if I showed an opening, I\u2019m sure she would take it.</p><br/><p>From the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, go tell him the weakness of a quilin already.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third was pressing the Fifth.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Weakness? There was something like that? Even if she\u2019s not up to Celes\u2019 level, that\u2019s a flippin\u2019 quilin, you know? Even like this, I think she\u2019s probably holding back over there.\u300f</p><br/><p>She\u2019s holding back? Why would she do that?</p><br/><p>Thinking that, I stuck my right sabre into the ground, and put that hand around the Jewel.</p><br/><p>The movements I had been tracing with Skills suddenly became duller.</p><br/><p>(So she\u2019s after the jewel after all. I don\u2019t think anything would come of her getting it.)</p><br/><p>But even if I told her, she didn\u2019t seem to believe it. That\u2019s why it was so troubling.</p><br/><p>While I tried thinking up a means to get the message across, the Fourth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, isn\u2019t this the place to use your Skill?\u300f</p><br/><p>I shook my head.</p><br/><p>(Fool! The condition for that one\u2019s a deep kiss! You think that\u2019s possible!?)</p><br/><p>There, the Fifth as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, that one sounds nice. Lyle, you\u2019ve never tested it, so I think there\u2019s some worth in trying it out.\u300f</p><br/><p>Why do these guys sound so laid back?</p><br/><p>Well sure, in order to take the Jewel, she wouldn\u2019t break it. That\u2019s likely why she wasn\u2019t giving it her all.</p><br/><p>But I was the same. I wasn\u2019t trying to kill her, and I wanted to solve the misunderstanding as well.</p><br/><p>The Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re still reluctant when she\u2019s in human form? Then how about you just have her take up quilin form?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right! If your opponent\u2019s an animal, then it\u2019s just something of a greeting!\u300f</p><br/><p>Um, please don\u2019t just write it off like that.</p><br/><p>But I do get the feeling it\u2019s the option with the greatest amount of possibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you listening? How about we talk a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>May jumped down from a branch, and looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to hand it over, I don\u2019t mind letting you go. But I\u2019ll be having you answer a few questions first.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, just listen to what I have to say for a bit. First change into your quilin form, then kiss me\u2026 no wait! I don\u2019t have the slightest bit of impure motives here! This is a necessity! It\u2019s just a momentary contact of mucous membranes! It\u2019ll be over if the tongue slips in for just a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 The look she sent me turned unbelievably cold.</p><br/><p>Eyes even colder than what she sent to those three boys were falling on me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I never thought Fredricks\u2019 descendent would wind up so\u2026 awful. It really is irritating.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the Jewel, the Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300eIdiot! Why are you angering her!?\u300f</p><br/><p>Even if you tell me that, I can\u2019t really imagine the sort of happenings that lead up to a kiss. We were in the middle of battle, and I was panicked, so failing to explain the crucial portions was my mistake, though.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Listen here, this is my Skill. If we kiss, then a line will be formed, and\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, and? Why is it I have to follow your orders? If you\u2019re trying to win through trickery, I\u2019d prefer you think up a better excuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s not an excuse! It\u2019s not, but even I\u2019m beginning to doubt it at this point.)</p><br/><p>To make a line between bodies, and allow for ideas to be transferred: Connection.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t the initial condition too cruel?</p><br/><p>The Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, even I can\u2019t follow up whatever you just spewed. You\u2019re the worst. But if you want to look at it from a best Lyle perspective, I have to say, it\u2019s not bad at all.\u300f</p><br/><p>The third as well.</p><br/><p>\u300ePick a time and place, why don\u2019t you. Good grief\u2026 so we\u2019re all good on having him kiss her in quilin form, right? Now then, it\u2019s restarting. See, she\u2019s coming!\u300f</p><br/><p>The aloof Third raised his voice, so I unhanded the Jewel, took the grounded sabre in hand, and cut at her incoming fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a horn?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fist was wrapped in cloth, and my sabre\u2019s edge didn\u2019t slice through. I had a hunch those weren\u2019t normal clothes, but as I thought, they had some sort of special power.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh so you\u2019d prefer being impaled on my horn? In that case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She moved to hit her right elbow into my flank, and I tried to jump back to avoid it, but the Fifth screamed out.</p><br/><p>\u300eJump further!\u300f</p><br/><p>With those words, not just by a little, I jumped with all my might, to find my clothing torn.</p><br/><p>At May\u2019s elbow, the cloth had been penetrated to reveal a large horn.</p><br/><p>When it retracted, her clothing wasn\u2019t damaged.</p><br/><p>I understood it was a wondrous material, but I was more relieved that my flank hadn\u2019t been cut through.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s no time to hold back.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, her eyebrows twitched in response?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you please not joke around? I\u2019m the one holding back over here. If I just wanted you to disappear, it would be over in an instant. You understand that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I stuck both my sabres into the ground, took the Jewel in my right hand, and plucked it off my neck as if to tear the chain. The chain wrapped around my arm, the silver ornaments expanded, and the giant sword took shape.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, May\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, that\u2019s no normal gem. You humans have gone and made more bizarre contraptions\u2026 but\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>She leapt right at me.</p><br/><p>But this time I matched her, and clashed.</p><br/><p>The sword let of sparks as it collided with the horn protruding from her left hand. This time without chipping, the edge remained intact.</p><br/><p>When I started attacking on my own, May jumped back as she eluded my swings.</p><br/><p>A Skill to temporarily increase one\u2019s abilities several times over.</p><br/><p>I used \u3010Full Burst\u3011 to push her back.</p><br/><p>Our standings had changed from before, and I made sure not to let her gain any ground. If she jumped back, I followed, if she tread in, I retreated.</p><br/><p>We both swung our weapons of choice as we maintained such a distance. And again the blades met and competed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, you\u2019re similar. You learned from the Fifth, did you? Well so did I!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she knew my movements, I also knew hers.</p><br/><p>Our relation was like pupils under the same master, and after I grasped the characteristics of her weapons, I could fight her normally.</p><br/><p>Even if she had the power and the speed, she was just like me in that she didn\u2019t match up to my predecessors. This was probably the limits of her human form.</p><br/><p>Impatiently, she let off a pale blue ling of light from her body.</p><br/><p>Emitting electricity, she forcefully opened some space between us.</p><br/><p>I jumped back.</p><br/><p>And before me stood her quilin form.</p><br/><p>She kicked the ground, and glared.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Now see here, I don\u2019t want to dawdle here too long. I\u2019ll let this end for now. All I need is to get my hands on that Jewel, and I have plenty of time left to spare. Now\u2026 don\u2019t disappear on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She raced off through the narrow forest ways, and I put away the large sword to give chase.</p><br/><p>She was running in zigzags, but regardless of the size of her build, she could run freely between the trees. All I could say was that she was a veteran of the field. She ran without any collisions, at quite a rate.</p><br/><p>Clenching the Jewel as I ran\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth!\u201d</p><br/><p>I called him, found a large tree, and put my back to it.</p><br/><p>When I pointed the Jewel in my right hands at May, the Fifth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eMay\u2026 wait!\u300f</p><br/><p>Those words shouldn\u2019t have reached her, but her body twitched, and she came to a sudden stop. Her hooves gouged out the ground, and stopping a few meters ahead, she tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hey, so you could do it all along.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fifth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eAnd what were you planning if she didn\u2019t stop!? In the first place, you should\u2019ve met up and discussed this sort of thing beforehand with me, or something like that! Use your head!\u300f</p><br/><p>Like a dog restraining itself from a treat before its eyes, May was watching me with heavy breath. But at the same time, she had regained some composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, so you still remember the time you spent together so faithfully. How many decades ago was that.\u201d</p><br/><p>And May\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 To me, they were happy memories. Won\u2019t you refrain from mocking them? But I see. Fredricks wants to protect you, does he? Then I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(So she felt the Fifth\u2019s sentiment to protect me?)</p><br/><p>When May walked closer, I pressed my clenched fist to her face.</p><br/><p>To be more precise, I put the Jewel to her. When I showed her the Jewel in the palm of my hand, she narrowed her eyes.</p><br/><p>The Fifth.</p><br/><p>\u300eMay, don\u2019t attack Lyle anymore. He\u2019s my descendant. So you don\u2019t have to\u2026 anymore\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry Fredricks. I think I can tell what you\u2019re saying, but your voice won\u2019t reach me. I\u2019m sorry. I only wanted to hear you again. I wanted you to pat my head again. So\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>She retracted her horn and put her forehead to the Jewel, so I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Continuing on from before. I have a certain Skill. \u3010Connection\u3011\u2026 it\u2019s a Skill that transmits thoughts. The conditions for that are a kiss. If you use me as a medium, you may be able to talk with the Fifth.\u201d</p><br/><p>May nodded, and turned her mouth towards me.</p><br/><p>Kissing an animal\u2026 I thought only a dog would ever lick your mouth. I had a bit of hesitation, but I kissed her.</p><br/><p>(Never thought my third kiss would be to an animal\u2026 right, come to think of it, Monica took that one. My first kiss, huh?)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I ended up thinking.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

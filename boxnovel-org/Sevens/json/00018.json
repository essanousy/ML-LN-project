Or could it be you found it an impossible request?\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps already aware we had completed it, she joked around as she motioned us to sit.</p><br/><p>I handed over the necessary documents. She inspected the envelope before delicately unsealing it and checking the papers within.</p><br/><p>She read through them before our eyes, and with the papers in her left hand, she put her right to her chin and nodded a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Evaluation is a\u300eB\u300f. But it\u2019s written here You were quite thorough with your work. Let me hand over the designated reward as promised.\u201d</p><br/><p>I presented my guild card. She took it and finished up the paperwork.</p><br/><p>Nimbly filling out the forms, she confirmed some things with me without stopping her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the contents of this report, your transportation time clocks at about five to six days one way. That\u2019s quite fast, you know. Did you use horses? Adventurers registered with the guild can borrow them quite cheaply if they fill out the necessary forms. Did you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at me. Judging by her smile, it seems she had looked up some things beforehand.</p><br/><p>It was a service that hadn\u2019t be present in anywhere besides Beim, but I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to use them next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, Tanya-san let out a light sigh, and returned her eyes to the papers. The top of her desk surely existed, but it was too loaded for me to confirm that fact.</p><br/><p>The sound of something like a seal being stamped rung out.</p><br/><p>After handing back my card with the paperwork, she left her seat. Likely to bring back my reward for the request.</p><br/><p>Clara\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWas that alright? Could that question not have affected the examination?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We were able to finish our job within the allotted timeframe. And our evaluation wasn\u2019t bad. If we\u2019re too competent, that\u2019ll be abused, and we don\u2019t currently have the ability to refute such an abuse. If we stretch too far and get too high an evaluation, it\u2019ll get hard to move around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing my opinion, Clara looked relieved. But being relied on by the guild was also a sort of honor.</p><br/><p>Your customer service gets put on a higher priority, it seems, and more than all else, your popularity rises. But I don\u2019t want to be burnt to ash by the guild.</p><br/><p>Especially in Beim, where a huge amount of requests flood in. There were enough to make processing them impossible, so a party as usable as ours may be something in high enough demand to warrant begging.</p><br/><p>Movements speed, and ability to deal with problems.</p><br/><p>Each of our members was competent, and able to accomplish an extent of tasks on their own. That\u2019s why I thought we should restrict our evaluations a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was an adventurer of Arumsaas for a considerable amount of time, but as I thought, Beim is different. The atmosphere aside, the quality of their receptionists is different.\u201d</p><br/><p>I agreed with her as I nodded at the horrid treatment from Arumsaas\u2019 guild. And we smiled a little as we waited.</p><br/><p>Tanya brought over a metal tray with the reward on it, and placed it on the counter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, please confirm the amount. And I think you understand the matters of the east branch, but from here on, you\u2019ll have to periodically carry out requests. When you have free time, we mind not if you go challenge a labyrinth or deal with some of the monsters around the city. But please uphold the proper manners in both fields.\u201d</p><br/><p>I checked over the monetary sum, and accepted it before confirming something with Tanya-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be troublesome if we\u2019re left with no freedom at all. About how often would we have to complete a request?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking out a faint metallic board with characters carved onto it, Tanya-san began giving us an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt depends on the contents and difficulty of the requests themselves, but if it\u2019s something like this time\u2019s, then at least once per month. Easier ones may warrant two to three within a single month.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was something as simple as a two day trip for minor monster slaying, it may take two to three times a month, it seems.</p><br/><p>From within the Jewel, I heard a voice. It was the Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300eThey don\u2019t have knights, so they have to have the adventurers do all the monsters slaying. Meaning they have soldiers that maintain themselves and earn money of their own accord\u2026 Gimme.\u300f</p><br/><p>No need for maintenance cost, what\u2019s more, as long as you put out an adequate reward when there was work to be done, they\u2019d go off and do it. I could see what the Fourth saw in it.</p><br/><p>The Seventh refuted that point.</p><br/><p>\u300eI don\u2019t need such soldiers. Using groups you can\u2019t ensure the competency of\u2026 there\u2019s enough of that risk in using mercenaries in war. Not that I\u2019d ever use that lot again.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh\u2019s adventurer hatred was considerable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the penalty if we fail to do so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara asked, and Tanya-san smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s fine if you think we won\u2019t do a thing on our side of the table.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at her smile, and thought.</p><br/><p>(So if they won\u2019t do anything at all, they won\u2019t do anything special either. They won\u2019t offer any special labyrinth subjugation services, I guess.)</p><br/><p>Rather than forcing adventurers to work, the guild likely prioritized finding powerful adventurers that worked.</p><br/><p>They had not the time to spend on an unmotivated lot. In the end, the guild was an organization that had control over the rights to Magic Stones.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t say managing adventurers was just an extra, but perhaps it wasn\u2019t their main interest.</p><br/><p>It was necessary to organize the adventurers that did the collection of the magic stones, but from their point of view, providing favorable customer service to us was just a freebee.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd by completing requests, you can be exempt from some taxes. If you haven\u2019t heard, doing them counts as sufficient service to the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you complete requests, the city of Beim will profit.</p><br/><p>The selling of magic stones wasn\u2019t taxed either. That was Beim\u2019s policy.</p><br/><p>Clara sounded tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever the case, most of the money adventurers make will be put to the City\u2019s use eventually. In this city without a feudal lord, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the important point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tanya-san smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re sharp. But I don\u2019t recommend you say it too often. You never know when a \u3010Sweeper\u3011 is listening in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wholesome cleaning company that\u2019s existence was fully admitted by the guild, but never came out on the surface. That was the Sweepers. Dealing with adventurers that had more power than the common man, they had to be skilled lest the occupation be in vain.</p><br/><p>In Clara\u2019s place, I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll watch ourselves. Of course, I doubt they\u2019d be quick tempered enough to set their aim for something as trifling as that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tanya-san spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh I wonder. Now then, congratulations for completing your first job in Beim. We\u2019ll be placing our expectations on you from here on, Lyle-kun. And Clara-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>I accepted what I was meant to, and learned I wouldn\u2019t have to do a request until next month. Planning May\u2019s adventurer registration for the following day, I stood from my seat, and exited the guild with Clara.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Having accepted the reward, Clara and I stopped by a food stall on the way to the inn.</p><br/><p>Rather than being hungry myself, I wanted to bring back a souvenir for May given the amount she ate. Of course, Aria and Shannon would likely dig in as well.</p><br/><p>While walking down the street lined with stalls, me and Clara picked out a few items.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeat skewers, is it? I\u2019m sure May-san and Aria-san will be delighted, but Shannon-chan is a bit questionable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, really? Doesn\u2019t she eat everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, Clara looked at me, and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do think there\u2019s something wrong with that image you have of her. While she does eat a lot, she\u2019s actually quite picky, and likes sweet things in particular.\u201d</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, that was quite true. But I still don\u2019t doubt she\u2019d be happy at receiving a meat skewer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we get her some molded candy? No, rather than candy, perhaps some grilled sweet potato would be nice? How about you, Clara?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? No, I don\u2019t require any food apart from at meal times.\u201d</p><br/><p>As an adventurer, she did eat her share, but compared to the other members, she was quite a light eater.</p><br/><p>I remembered that sweets were supposed to help when you used your head, so I used a large copper to buy some sweet confectionaries from a nearby stand.</p><br/><p>I handed the bag over.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s candy, it\u2019ll last a while, and all you have to do is keep it in your mouth as you read. It won\u2019t restrict your hands or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara nodded stiffly, as she accepted, and looked down a little.</p><br/><p>From the Jewel came the Third\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eOh, Lyle\u2019s finally moved to raise Clara\u2019s affection level!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u300eHm, if you take Shannon out of the picture- you bought her a pendent a while ago anyways- you\u2019ve got seven left to please\u2026 you sure have it rough, boy!\u300f</p><br/><p>I got the urge to hit my ancestors as they laughed over the matter, but as of now, I\u2019ve still yet to get a single blow in.</p><br/><p>Perhaps today will be my lucky day.</p><br/><p>And I heard a voice.</p><br/><p>It was the voice of disputing adventurers. More specifically, as if a fight had broken out among comrades.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying it\u2019s my fault!?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned my eyes to it, I saw Erhart with his large sword over his back. As always, he wore nothing but a tank top above. I really can\u2019t understand that one.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t he get cold like that?</p><br/><p>Clara put the brown paper bag of candies under her arm as she looked over at Erhart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like they\u2019ve just came back from a request.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had the same sort of envelope I had received, and it was getting quite ruffled in his clenched fist. Before him were his comrades, or should I say lackeys, staring him down with unpleasant expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it is! In the first place, saying one day without even looking it up\u2026 it took four whole days to reach, did it not!? And when we got there, you went and pissed the requester off, so we\u2019re sure to get a low evaluation for it! We barely have any money on us, so what are you trying to do by reducing our income!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems he angered the client and dropped their evaluation.</p><br/><p>I confirmed their actions from afar, and decided to keep a set distance. I was just a little curious as to why they would pick a place like this for a fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll I did was buy a single freakin\u2019 skewer from the stand, and this is what I get!? You\u2019re way too high strung. If a worthy request comes along, we\u2019ll be earning like there\u2019s no tomorrow, so for now, shut it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Within all their monetary dissatisfaction, it seems he went off and bought a meat skewer for himself.</p><br/><p>From within the Jewel, the Sixth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo matter how you look at it, that\u2019s no good.\u300f</p><br/><p>Erhart seemed quite fed up, but the Third laughed as he\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eYeah~ everyone has their own way of leading people, but that one\u2019s no good. He isn\u2019t the type to lead with charisma, so just telling people to follow him is\u2026 did he already forget how he lost to Lyle? Well, it\u2019s an interesting performance he puts on, but getting caught up in it will be a pain. Lyle, how about you leave as soon as you can?\u300f</p><br/><p>If he spotted me, perhaps he\u2019d ask for a rematch here and now. That\u2019s got to be bad, or how should I put it, more a pain, so took Clara\u2019s hand, and led her away.</p><br/><p>The Fifth let a few-up voice from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eOblivious, and reckless. Well, he may grow a bit if he adventures for a while. If I had to say, then Lyle\u2019s too well-mannered for his position.\u300f</p><br/><p>To succeed, a certain level of reckless was necessary, said the Fifth. I do admit that such a side may prove essential.</p><br/><p>But one step in the wrong direction, and it\u2019s self-destruction.</p><br/><p>If all goes well, it\u2019s a success story, but the future really depends on the individual\u2019s disposition.</p><br/><p>Crawling up, and establishing his own style of life as an adventurer isn\u2019t completely impossible.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m technically his senior, but here we\u2019re both newbies.</p><br/><p>(I had Novem and the ancestors to advise me\u2026 otherwise, I may have been the one being laughed at right around now.)</p><br/><p>Around Erhart, the troubled city dwellers. And the smiling places of adventurers among them.</p><br/><p>The ones concerned continued on loudly without paying mind to such things.</p><br/><p>Looking at Erhart, I honestly saw a possibility I shouldn\u2019t be playing around with.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 A room of the guild.</p><br/><p>There, Tanya gave her report on the adventurers to her superior.</p><br/><p>She had submitted a number of forms, with her own evaluations on them.</p><br/><p>The higher-up looked through the documents on the new adventurers enlisting in the east branch, as he sipped his tea.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a former adventurer, but a type more proficient in managing magic stones. But he still had to hear of adventurer matters from those involved, and he was a superior highly regarded by his subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your opinion on the matter, \u3010Tahnia\u3011? IS there any shining ray of talent in these files?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her name stressed strangely, Tahnia did not offer a correction. Because she accepted them as two separate names.</p><br/><p>Tanya was the name of a guild employee.</p><br/><p>While Tahnia was that of a sweeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I think there are a number of parties that could turn up a profit. And it\u2019s about the party headed by Lyle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her superior searched for the papers, took it in hand, and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s attained a high evaluation quite splendidly. It\u2019s not anything extraordinary, but not bad either. At this rate, it won\u2019t be long until he enters a labyrinth.\u201d</p><br/><p>While nodding, Tahnia\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the finest evaluation. But I can\u2019t help but think he was aiming for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her superior looked at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnsatisfied with something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, proficient adventurers are the guild\u2019s precious assets. I do think that he, his party, will become a valuable asset for the eastern branch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking Tahnia had found something shady on the boy, the higher-up took a sip of tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t that fine? We need only support them. If they moderately complete requests such as this, then offer them a place in labyrinth subjugation. If you do nothing but use them, they\u2019ll flow somewhere else before you know it. You need a moderate level of bait on the table.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Tahnia nodded, and continued on with her report.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd next up is one on the worse side of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>The superior turned his eyes to a pile of documents he had been avoiding. But as it wasn\u2019t a rare occurrence, he didn\u2019t seem all that interested. These sorts of folks popped up every year without fail.</p><br/><p>A ruckus over a duel, by young\u2019uns who\u2019d become adventurers oblivious to the point of the trade.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do the usual. If they look to be useful to the guild, then guide them on, and if not, then leave them be. And if in the process, they end up wandering elsewhere, it\u2019ll actually be a blessing for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guild liked to keep problematic adventurers at a distance.</p><br/><p>And Erhart and co were just such adventurers. But it\u2019s not like they\u2019d give up on them right away. There was always a fixed level of adventurers like them, and there were plenty of cases where such adventurers matured and grew.</p><br/><p>The guild had their ways to turn them into the proper adventurers they imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh right\u2026 Tahnia, you\u2019re too competent a woman. Let\u2019s put a broad-minded receptionist in charge of them. And with this matter, let\u2019s make her their exclusive receptionist and call it a penalty.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s just how many receptionists they had under their control. Such treatments were possible.</p><br/><p>A single beautiful receptionist could be set to come into contact with a number of parties, and motivate them. You could also call it a way to use them however it seemed convenient.</p><br/><p>When the beauty who welcomed them to the guild so warmly sounded troubled over how no one would take up a request, what would they do? Perhaps they\u2019d feel a sense of debt, or courtesy. Adventurers with such sentiment may take the initiative and complete such unfavorable requests splendidly.</p><br/><p>Adventurers who\u2019d stacked up some ability in another land would avoid such requests if they knew it would put them at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s why, there always had to be a set amount of Erharts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething something scissors are all about how you use them, was it? If he becomes a first-rate adventurer, the guild will benefit. And he\u2019ll also benefit greatly himself. No~ we all should be a relation where no one loses out, you know. Both the guild, and its adventurers.\u201d</p><br/><p>(TL: The phrase he\u2019s going here is, \u2019Idiots and scissors are all about how you use them.\u2019 A Japanese idiom of which you can pretty much guess the meaning. The scissor part is on how even blunt scissors can cut if you use them right. This is also the Japanese title for the series Dog &amp; Scissors, if you replace the idiot part with dog.)</p><br/><p>Before her grinning superior, Tahnia nodded, collected up the documents over his desk, and tidily put them together.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, she left the room. Her superior:</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd good luck with the receptions desk, Tanya.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Please stop!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the Jewel\u2019s conference room, I was curled up on the floor with both hands over my ears.</p><br/><p>No matter how much I screamed or submitted, there was no sign of it stopping.</p><br/><p>The villainy of these six.</p><br/><p>No, five.</p><br/><p>The Fifth was just looked over the others with a fed-up look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u300eAs I thought, the best one has to be the \u300eKiss the Sleeping Beauty\u300f, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third was standing in front of a blackboard, picking out the interesting events from my recent Growth.</p><br/><p>Gathered around it were the Second through Seventh, and they were arguing and exchanging opinions to decide what was this times greatest achievement.</p><br/><p>The Fourth agreed with that proposal.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Lyle\u2019s actions this time around of giving his first kiss to an automaton win this race by a landslide.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second brought up an objection.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s hard to rule out his words of love to Novem-chan. That questionable expression she had on her face as she tried to calm him down\u2026 don\u2019t you think it was wonderful?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eI think him scaling the wall, and crashing and burning posed with bug in hand was quite a splendid piece too.\u300f</p><br/><p>Remembering the scene, the Third burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis time was a plentiful harvest. What was that about not making the same mistake twice? At this rate, how about we just hold a \u300eBest Lyle Award\u300f each time?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh looked at me, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, those with the outstanding talent to make others laugh with their Growths to this extent are quite hard to come by, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sure he was trying to console me, but it wasn\u2019t working at all.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sure all these guys were sitting back, and watching the scene in laughter.</p><br/><p>Why did I give such a consecutive stream of failures\u2026 even if I try thinking hard about it, I can\u2019t reach an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go on. I\u2019m never going out again. Ever!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, a fed up Fifth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re making too big a deal of simple laughter. More importantly, can we get into the main topic now?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u300ePlease wait! Just a little more time to decide Best Lyle please!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth spoke, while having his glasses catch the light.</p><br/><p>I hate these guys.</p><br/><p>\u300eI don\u2019t think his emphasis on eating Shannon up at the end should be ignored too easily. Well, there\u2019s also the fact that the Fifth and Sixth were too conscious about it.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth\u2019s eye shifted to the Fifth and Sixth.</p><br/><p>The Fifth remained calm, and the Sixth folded his arms with a foul expression on his face.</p><br/><p>After Miranda-san returned, there weren\u2019t any notable changes.</p><br/><p>Regarding Shannon, she requested that we leave it to her.</p><br/><p>With the understanding that there would be a heated sister to sister talk, we entrusted her to it.</p><br/><p>From my point of view, it seems I didn\u2019t have to do something like smashing her eyes, so there wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy eat, I didn\u2019t mean it in such a suggestive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I resisted, the Second and Third\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eHmm, so what sort of feelings did you have then?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019d like to hear it, just how you felt at that time.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u300eNow, out with it, Lyle!!\u300f\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are the worst! If you know what\u2019s going on, then stop me! And wait, please stop me, grandfather! No, gramps!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked over at the Seventh, I found him covering his mouth, and hitting against the table.</p><br/><p>Did I say something funny? Just looking at him is irritating.</p><br/><p>But these recent actions were none other than my own, so I have nothing to say about them.</p><br/><p>Letting out a sigh, the Fifth finally stepped in to end the flow.</p><br/><p>(And wait, hasn\u2019t it been a bit too long? I get the feeling these guys have been at it for at least two hours\u2026)</p><br/><p>While thinking he should have stopped them early, I turned to face him.</p><br/><p>\u300eAre you satisfied yet? Well, decide your Best Lyle Award or whatever on your own time. First, let\u2019s talk about that automaton.\u300f</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>The one I kissed to register myself as its master. The bad mouthed maid Automaton.</p><br/><p>At Damien\u2019s laboratory, she\u2019s currently being asked, and investigated on for various things.</p><br/><p>If you\u2019re asking what I don\u2019t like about that, it\u2019s that she elaborately recorded the details of my conversation, and she was treating them as an official record.</p><br/><p>Damien, you bastard\u2026 not letting a single phrase past, he was passionately intending to use my conversation with the automaton in his thesis and further experiments.</p><br/><p>And the high-spirited me gave permission for that.</p><br/><p>By this point, there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s gathered all the necessary data.</p><br/><p>(If I tell him it\u2019s no good tomorrow, it definitely won\u2019t get through his head.)</p><br/><p>The number gathered students and professors in the laboratory wasn\u2019t to be laughed at.</p><br/><p>To Damien, it was nothing but a means for him to increase his funding, but if you think carefully about it, it was a revolutionary breakthrough.</p><br/><p>I had been thinking too lightly about the fact that an ancient automaton had awoken.</p><br/><p>Damien Valle\u2026 he may be a pervert, but he\u2019s truly a genius.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, it\u2019s not good to just leave her to Novem, but if you just think of it as having our number of helpers increase, there\u2019s no real problem. The main issue is how to maintain it.\u300f</p><br/><p>I asked Damien, and apparently, we would generally get maintenance free of charge.</p><br/><p>But that \u2018generally\u2019 part made me curious.</p><br/><p>And having returned to his serious expression, the Seventh informed me.</p><br/><p>(You\u2019re late, gramps.)</p><br/><p>\u300eThe truth is, Lyle\u2026 your Mana is being robbed by a source apart from us. Apart from the Mana used to charge the First\u2019s \u3010Full Burst\u3011 Skill, it seems that a new line has been created.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cA new line?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the fact that my Mana was being taken, I tilted my head.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t feel anything like that.</p><br/><p>The Second spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eYour Mana has increased as a whole, so that\u2019s good and all\u2026 but you\u2019re constantly having a fixed amount extracted from you. The burden on your shoulders has increased. And so, we\u2019ve done a bit of thinking on our part.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third took over.</p><br/><p>\u300eWe\u2019ve reached the conclusion that the toxic maid is definitely suspicious! No~ for you to have gotten something that sucks it the moment your Mana increased, I guess you\u2019ve got a talent of sorts, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhile you may be able to use a greater amount of Mana than before, if you use it too frequently, you\u2019ll run dry before you know it.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth brought it together.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s always a fixed sum drained out, or this is just the average\u2026 it will be messy from here on.\u300f</p><br/><p>It seems I may have picked up quite an extraordinary toxic maid.</p><br/><p>The Mana that had finally increased was going towards maintaining that automaton\u2019s function?</p><br/><p>(No, perhaps it\u2019s the Mana that\u2019s being maintained? By that thing?)</p><br/><p>I\u2019m suspicious about whether or not she will do her work properly, but the Mana steal is the greater problem.</p><br/><p>I thought I would finally be able to fight freely with magic, but that plan has gone amiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo does that mean I just have to fight with the same style as always? After going through such an embarrassing Growth, the restrictions on my magic haven\u2019t even been lifted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was getting depressed, the Fifth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, let me add this on, but Lyle\u2026 your use of Skills will be restricted for a while.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I lifted my face to match his.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem to be joking.</p><br/><p>The Sixth continued on.</p><br/><p>\u300eYour Skill \u3010Experience\u3011is perpetually active, so there\u2019s no helping it, but the other Skills will be completely restricted.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Seventh agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eWe\u2019ll be personally restricting them, so you really will be unable to use them in the truest sense. Please act with that in mind. Oh, the Firsts as well. That large sword is\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re forbidden from using that sword. For a while, you should persevere as an adventurer with your own power.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cU-um, I\u2019m really not sure what\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was unsure of what was happening, the Third continued on.</p><br/><p>They were the conditions for me to be able to use Skills.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf you defeat the thirtieth basement floor\u2019s boss, and return to the guild\u2026 if you\u2019re able to do that, then we will let you use Skills once more. Oh, we\u2019ll still offer advice, so don\u2019t worry.\u300f</p><br/><p>Rather than you guys\u2019 advice, the Skill usage is\u2026 I swallowed those words, and looked around.</p><br/><p>Everyone had earnest expressions.</p><br/><p>The Fourth explained.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo matter how you look at it, with just the Skills, your current state would be able to transcend the ranks of first rate adventurers. With them, you were able to conquer the fortieth floor of a labyrinth with only six.\u300f</p><br/><p>Normally, a party of fifty would challenge it, and barely get by, but we were able to do it with six.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Seventh went ahead and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eThere\u2019s no problem with using Skills. It\u2019s not bad to use what talent you have on hand. Up to a point, that is.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second told me.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou haven\u2019t grown in the slightest on our own. Not that sort of Growth, but growth in the truest sense. Whenever something happens, you turn to rely on the Skills. If you continue on like that, your Mana will run out, or perhaps a Growth will happen again, and you\u2019ll be forced to retire from the front lines. When that happens, what will you do?\u300f</p><br/><p>I could imagine it quite simply.</p><br/><p>The moment I became unable to move, the party would cease functioning.</p><br/><p>In the worst case, we would be annihilated while waiting for me to recover.</p><br/><p>A party that relied on my Skills could birth such dangers merely through my absence.</p><br/><p>The Third talked on.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s completely fine to use Skills. But with this many, there will definitely be a problem at some point. When you accept a request beyond your own ability, your troubles will merely increase. Before something like that happens, you and Novem-chan and Aria-chan have to polish yourselves. I think this is the time for that.\u300f</p><br/><p>The ancestors that had been teasing my up to now were all seriously thinking for my sake.</p><br/><p>(So this is what Damien was talking about.)</p><br/><p>I nodded, and swore to clear the thirtieth level without Skills.</p><br/><p>Until then, I would be limited to what I had on myself.</p><br/><p>And the Third\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then, that\u2019s out of the way, so the next pressing matter is\u2026 The Best Lyle goes to kissing the sleeping beauty! Any objections?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u300eObjection! You\u2019re forgetting her ignoring his words of love!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s hard to say which of the two is better, but I\u2019m leaning towards the sleeping beauty.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eThat one had quite a bit of impact. Surpassing it is going to be difficult.\u300f</p><br/><p>Sixth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eSliding posed with a bug in hand. It would be troublesome if you forgot that!\u300f</p><br/><p>Damn gramps\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eAs expected of the Walt House\u2019s child prodigy\u2026 for him to trouble us to this extent!\u300f</p><br/><p>All of them\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u300e\u300eI\u2019ll be waiting for your next growth, Walt House wonder child!!\u300f\u300f\u300f</p><br/><p>They said that with smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop finding entertainment in this!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I definitely don\u2019t think I\u2019m at fault for screaming there.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Late at night.</p><br/><p>Having been released from the depths of the Jewel, I exited to the yard, sat in a bench, and looked up at the night sky.</p><br/><p>When I got some water in the kitchen, the face that was reflected in the mirror was quite haggard.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ve pressed me this far\u2026 god dammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The past I wanted to forget had become important research data for the academy.</p><br/><p>I thought I had fallen for myself time and again. Just what sort of wind could have driven me to think in such a way?</p><br/><p>Thinking about it didn\u2019t produce an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be nice if I could go back to the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I let that out of my mouth, I saw Novem approaching the bench.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lyle-sama? Are you having trouble sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>A worried Novem was in her pajamas.</p><br/><p>I thought she was cute, but at the same time, I was forced to remember my kiss with that toxic maid.</p><br/><p>I wanted my first kiss to be Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to disappear already\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~ is it about today? There was no helping it. Everyone feels that uplifting sensation. It\u2019s just that it came out quite remarkably for you, Lyle-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if she tries consoling me, it doesn\u2019t change the facts that my lips were stolen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will never come back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy first kiss will never come back to me! I want to beat the crap out of the me of that time!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, Novem\u2019s face became troubled.</p><br/><p>Why must Novem be troubled? Am I not enough, I thought as I got myself even more unnecessarily depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we not count it? I mean, I heard it was to a doll.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s ridiculously human, so I can\u2019 bring myself to think of it that way, and that toxicity is definitely going to break my heart. If I wasn\u2019t in such high tensions, I would have definitely had my heart fold in onto itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even remembering it now, it was a fearsome ancient automaton.</p><br/><p>Why would the people of old create such a malicious maid?</p><br/><p>(Did those ancients have a pervert surpassing Damien\u2019s level? \u2026 I don\u2019t really want to think about it.)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso I\u2026 won\u2019t be able to use Skills for a while. It\u2019s kinda like everything is happening to me at once, and I don\u2019t think my heart can take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, Novem sat down beside me, and gripped my hand.</p><br/><p>Looking up at the sky, she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I ask why you can\u2019t use Skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, ah well\u2026 at this rate, I\u2019ll become no good, and I want to become able to defeat the thirtieth floor\u2019s boss with my own ability at least once.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like the ancestors ever actually told me I would become no good.</p><br/><p>A worried Novem could take my foolish notions to be an illness, fasten me to a bed, and nurse me\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that be fine?</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s no good. I have to become the breadearner, and let Novem live a quiet life\u2026 it would be nice if I could do that.</p><br/><p>Seeing me become faint hearted, Novem spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a little. I\u2019ve become a little jealous. Hearing that Lyle-sama\u2019s first kiss was taken by an automaton\u2026 is that strange of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I stood up, and grasped both of her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s not strange at all! I\u2019m happy! I\u2019m delighted, Novem!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-is that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing me in high spirits, Novem looked puzzled.</p><br/><p>The fact that she became jealous for me must mean that she was a little interested in me, or so I reassured myself.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s fine\u2026 Novem hasn\u2019t given up on me yet, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 want to kiss Novem.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, her face was flushed red.</p><br/><p>She quietly closed her eyes, lifted her chin a little, and assumed a pose exceedingly easy to kiss.</p><br/><p>My heart let out a thumping sound in my chest.</p><br/><p>Under the beautiful moonlit night sky, me and Novem\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m delighted, Novem!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eMy heart will break~\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eMy first kiss will never come back to me!!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Pff\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI wish I could return to the past was the defining factor.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSo he\u2019s even at that level when he\u2019s in his normal state\u2026 I think you\u2019re taking a turn for the worse, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite screwing with me, you guys!!\u201d</p><br/><p>And on another day, the words from that time were reliable used as fuel to tease me. By these ancestors, my psych was being beaten black and blue.</p><br/><p>What should I do\u2026 I think it\u2019s about time to toss this Jewel away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

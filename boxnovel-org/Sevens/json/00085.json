Note, Lyle is \u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30eb, and mr. lyle is \u3089\u3044\u3048\u308b\u3055\u3093.</p><br/><p>TL: The new semester started, and I was trying to find time in my new schedule to trans\u2026 no, let me be honest here, there\u2019s that too, but I decided to take basic Japanese for credit, and because of that, I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with the language in my free time. My new schedule doesn\u2019t really change my workload, but it quadruples my commute time.</p><br/><p>Prologue</p><br/><p>Clad in robes, seven, me included, were passing through the gates of Centralle.</p><br/><p>I, \u3010Lyle Walt\u3011, was observing the surroundings from the center of that group.</p><br/><p>Around, there were travelers and merchants and adventurers lined up, set for the capital, and among them, there was even a troupe of performers.</p><br/><p>The cold had become even more severe, and looking up, the clouded sky seemed as if it could pour out snow at any moment.</p><br/><p>I gazed up high, and thought over the reason we had separated from the group and gone ahead to the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Infiltrate the Capital first, and spread rumor of the expeditionary corps. How frightfully brilliant if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nearby, the red-haired Aria had her violet eyes clouded over as she held both hands to her ears.</p><br/><p>Recently she\u2019d been polishing her manly side, but when you look at her like this, she sure is cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, dear Aria? If your ears are cold, I\u2019ll lend you my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He\u2019s a stranger\u2026 the current Lyle\u2019s a stranger\u2026 given the time, he\u2019ll become the comrade we know and love again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She gave a muffled reply in a low voice, and I think her bashfulness was simply adorable.</p><br/><p>There, the pale verdant haired Miranda-san was staring at the ground with eyes that had lost their highlights.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t seem in the best of moods either, Miranda-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, Miranda-san issued a voice as if she was forcefully wringing it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Lyle\u2026 please take off the -san. Also don\u2019t talk so much. I don\u2019t want to remember it right now. I\u2019m begging you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, Miranda! Oh? I get the feeling the distance between our hearts just shrunk by that much! Also\u2026 if you want to be a bird flying free in the skies, then I\u2019ll be your\u2026 no! I\u2019ll become all of your roosts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just a little while back, both Aria and Miranda had stated their desire to become birds.</p><br/><p>And Miranda of wanting me to be her cage, I believe.</p><br/><p>As I said that, Miranda\u2019s face turned bright red, and she made a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>Aria crouched down on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you know. I\u2019m happy, but\u2026 I\u2019m begging you, right now\u2026 now alone is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, your face is bright red, you know? Haha, let me guess\u2026 You\u2019ve fallen for me, haven\u2019t you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eBffffffff!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The blue Jewel hanging at my neck was bestowed with silver craftsmanship of rare metal.</p><br/><p>The voice that came from it was that of the Sixth Generation Head, \u3010Fiennes Walt\u3011.</p><br/><p>From a glance, he looked quite rebellious, but in truth, he couldn\u2019t raise his head to the Fifth Generation Head.</p><br/><p>The Sixth\u2019s time period was a dark age of Bahnseim history, and the Capital was rotten with bribery left and right.</p><br/><p>For that sake, the man had no choice but to stick his hands in various things.</p><br/><p>Like that, he had a dark image stuck onto him, and the Sixth was later evaluated as the greatest scoundrel of the Walt House.</p><br/><p>In all actuality, he inherited the foundation the fifth had built, challenged surrounding territories, attained victory, and greatly expanded the House\u2019s land.</p><br/><p>He did dabble in quite a bit, given the times, but it\u2019s also fact that he wouldn\u2019t have survived if he hadn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>That Sixth contained a laugh, and holding their stomachs, the other ancestors also burst out.</p><br/><p>The Third.</p><br/><p>\u300eAlready three candidates lined up! Frighteningly brilliant, becoming a roost. Ah, and falling for you!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth was also laughing.</p><br/><p>\u300eBest Lyllllee! It looks like we\u2019ll have quite a harvest this time.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Lyle, you haven\u2019t learned a single thing from last time.\u300f</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what he says, but all I\u2019ve done is speak the truth. There\u2019s no helping it.</p><br/><p>I flipped my hair, and looked at Monica carrying a loading tray.</p><br/><p>On it was the form of the Gryphon in its coffin of ice.</p><br/><p>We were purposely showing it off, and those around were brimming with curiosity.</p><br/><p>Easily carrying such heavy-looking luggage, she had leisurely draped a loose robe over her maid uniform, and looked at me with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Making such a happy face?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, Monica\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could go without a smile. The chicken dickhead I awoke to has finally returned! Back then, you said you would fly through the sky, but for it to be through physical means was something even I didn\u2019t anticipate. I was sure you meant to make it bigger in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I went up against the Gryphon, I rode on its back, and soared through the sky.</p><br/><p>It was quite a thrilling and enjoyable experience, I believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t praise me so. It\u2019s fine if you want to promote me to flying chicken dickhead, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo long, rejected. Chicken dickhead it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her acting joyously bashful, I felt surrounding eyes collect on us.</p><br/><p>Well well well, I thought, as I waited for the gatekeeper to issue us permission to pass.</p><br/><p>Even more apologetic than usual, Clara held up her large staff. Her ruffled deep-blue hair hung over her face.</p><br/><p>From within the gaps in it, her red eyes were watching me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I do want to apologize for my behavior the other day, but at the moment, I really don\u2019t want to get involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing such a complex Clara, I shot her a smile. Yeah, it\u2019s okay to feel sad sometimes.</p><br/><p>She pulled her hood down lower, as if trying to run from my field of vision.</p><br/><p>Nearby, Miranda\u2019s pale violet-haired sister Shannon looked at me with pitiful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are the worst case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, are you at that age where you come to tease the boy you like? Unfortunately, if you want to catch my eye, you\u2019ll have to build up a few more years first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No, we\u2019re only two apart, aren\u2019t we? Are you an idiot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd how should I shut the mouth saying such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I brought my face closer, she hurriedly covered her mouth with her hands.</p><br/><p>I lightly flicked her forehead with my finger, and spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019Tis but a joke. I\u2019ll put that on hold until you\u2019re a bonifide lady. Become a splendid one, you hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Seventh let out his voice from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis time\u2019s missing that explosive something. Even when he\u2019s creating happenings left and right\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>He seemed truly mortified, but I\u2019m not a man who\u2019ll keep on adding to a past I want to forget.</p><br/><p>Shannon spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Novem, I think this man\u2019s lost it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSaying it with your face so red\u2026 I see! You\u2019re hiding your embarrassment. You sure are cute, Shannon.\u201d</p><br/><p>With her long brown hair tied into a single side ponytail, and violet eyes, Novem looked at me and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, let\u2019s book an inn at once. Any more of this may truly become dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>She truly did seem worried, and thinking that I may be the only one out there to make her this concerned, I felt a little blessed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, if you say so, we\u2019ll find an inn somewhere or another\u2026 a twin room is fine as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s keep it at personal rooms. I\u2019m sure that would be for the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>While marveling over the cuteness of Novem\u2019s embarrassed face, it finally came our turn to pass.</p><br/><p>She spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow any more is dangerous, so let\u2019s quickly proceed to the inn.\u201d</p><br/><p>While watching Novem frantically give out orders, I finally passed under the gate of Centralle.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Noon had passed when we arrived at the inn, and in order to carry out our plan, I tried to go out again.</p><br/><p>But Novem and the others stopped me.</p><br/><p>In the end, the only ones to remain in the inn were me, Monica, and Shannon.</p><br/><p>We had separate rooms prepared, and the inn was one where each had a shower and toilet equipped.</p><br/><p>The first floor was built as a dining hall. It was quite a standard establishment in Centralle, and thinking back to the start of my journey, it was a class of inn I could only now stay at without giving too much mind to the cost.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite moving a sentiment. I\u2019ve really been through a lot since then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Driven from the Walt House I called home, I became an adventurer with my former fianc\u00e9e Novem.</p><br/><p>Not knowing left from right, I listened in to the ancestors words, and used their Skills, relying on the Jewel.</p><br/><p>In the city of Dalien, I had an encounter with Aria, and after moving to the City of Scholars, I met Miranda, Shannon, Monica and Clara.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t say our recruiting went all too favorable, but I can definitely sense a bond with my current comrades.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Even when I already have Novem\u2026 how sinful a man\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, looking into the mirror in the room, the Fourth agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eExactly. How about considering your current situation for a moment? You\u2019ll get a knife to the back at this rate. Well, Novem\u2019s there, so it\u2019ll probably turn out alright.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cJealousy? On the contrary, I\u2019m actually quite comfortable here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, the third interjected.</p><br/><p>\u300emr. lyle best Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing him, I became a little embarrassed from his praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you praise me so, I\u2019ve nothing to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, I heard a knock at the door.</p><br/><p>With a tray in hand, Shannon entered accompanied by Monica.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle, it\u2019s time for lunch. It would be a pain for us all if you went and caused some problems outside, so we took the liberty of purchasing sandwiches at the dining hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>On a small and circular table in the room, she lined up two portions of food.</p><br/><p>As an automaton of ancient make, Monica was able to live on even without eating.</p><br/><p>Of course, she had a line built connecting her to me, and she arbitrarily lived on my Mana.</p><br/><p>It was as if we were connected by the string of fate.</p><br/><p>Shannon took her seat, and began munching on her sandwich.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dry and tasteless.\u201d</p><br/><p>While she blatantly expressing such impressions, Monica offered me some seasonings.</p><br/><p>\u201cChicken dick, here I have mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. Use it as you will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon stared at her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why is it Lyle. Normally, wouldn\u2019t you be offering it to me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon shouted out quite angrily, but Monica was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh how late you are to the table, little girl! My number one is this chicken dickhead, regardless of how pitiful a state he\u2019s in. You get it? It\u2019s because there\u2019s love. Love!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn automaton\u2026 well, so be it. Lyle, I\u2019ll be borrowing this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Shannon spread several layers of mayonnaise in the gap between the breads.</p><br/><p>Of the seasonings Monica produced, a large majority were exceedingly tasty.</p><br/><p>They were ancient flavors I doubt you\u2019d ever find in stores.</p><br/><p>It appears she knew the recipes, so she made them in advance.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, girly! That\u2019s the prized possession of that Chicken!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon ignored it, and stuffed her cheeks with the sandwich, and continued on with her meal.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how the girl acted now, but none too long ago, she was a woman who played the part of an unseeing maiden.</p><br/><p>She was reformed through Miranda, and now served as our comrade.</p><br/><p>According to the ancestors in the Jewel, she had Demon Eyes, or something like that.</p><br/><p>(If I had eyes like hers\u2026)</p><br/><p>I was just a little jealous.</p><br/><p>When I brought my sandwich to my own mouth, I found it truly was quite dry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is tasteless. If it\u2019s like this, than Novem\u2019s or Monica\u2019s cooking would be leagues ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, Monica delightedly lifted the ends of her golden twin tails as she\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally! I loathe being compared to that damn vixen, but my love is stuffed full of love, I tell you. Having been made custom to your tongue, it\u2019ll never fall short of any of the rabble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that much, I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for everything, Monica\u2026 I really do like your cooking. Tonight, I\u2019d like to eat something you\u2019ve made for once. It\u2019s been quite a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica stiffened for a moment, before turning to me with creaking movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-s-s-s-s-so you mean..! You mean you wish to eat my cooking? You\u2019re saying you wish to eat up my love!? Of course I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll pack in enough love to make it lethal!!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a smile, I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 with an extra-large serving of love, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, she promptly exited the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the preparations right away! Calculate the required time, and assemble the ingredients\u2026 in that case why not use up all my secret stash to make the supreme..!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The loud voice she let out as she ran away was surely audible from outside the inn.</p><br/><p>Shannon gnommed her first sandwich to its end, and began spreading ketchup over the second one.</p><br/><p>I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, she sure is a cute one.\u201d</p><br/><p>And from within the Jewel, the Seventh\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 And that\u2019s all she wrote. With an extra-large serving of love. Is that really all we\u2019ll get this time around?\u300f</p><br/><p>And on his query, the Sixth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eNot yet! There\u2019s still time. The Walt House\u2019s Wonder Child has yet to show his mettle!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eI think, \u2018Jealousy? On the contrary, I\u2019m quite comfortable,\u2019 wasn\u2019t bad!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eWe must be patient, men! This atmosphere\u2026 right now, it\u2019s just mr. lyle and Shannon-chan alone! It will come. Hope will definitely arrive!\u300f</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry for those overly-exited ancestors of mine, but this is already the third time for me. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d make the same mistakes thrice.</p><br/><p>(Sorry, but I can\u2019t live up to your expectations.)</p><br/><p>Shannon was looking over at my sandwich.</p><br/><p>I had used the mustard on mine, so perhaps that made her curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t need it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while saying that, she continued taking fleeting glances, so I brought the consumable over to her mouth.</p><br/><p>There, her small mouth opened, and clamped down into the bread.</p><br/><p>Mustard flowed out onto the area around her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this one isn\u2019t bad either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo in the end, you still went and ate it. Not that I really mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I moved to wipe off her mouth, she tossed the remains of the sandwich into her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~ I\u2019m stuffed. Can\u2019t eat another bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>And to the girl saying such things, I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019ve barely had any. I guess I\u2019ll save my appetite for tonight\u2026 ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She rested her chin on the table, and I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was just wonder how long it\u2019d take until you\u2019d be ripe for the picking. At present, it feels like a distant future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I shook my head. Shannon rose from her seat, and took some distance from me.</p><br/><p>From the Jewel, the Fifth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Ripe for the picking? Isn\u2019t that enough?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eExtra servings of love. I won\u2019t give up that one yet!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth casually joined in.</p><br/><p>(Good grief, just what are these people doing?)</p><br/><p>Pondering over my ancestors, I continued to play along with Shannon\u2019s retreat.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 On the main road.</p><br/><p>The group proceeding down it was centered around an extravagant carriage, with knights and soldiers marching in file by its side.</p><br/><p>Judging from their equipment and the quality of the men, they had received considerable training, and to avoid any involvement with them, the other parties on the road would preemptively move themselves out of the way.</p><br/><p>Surmising they would attain safe travels free of charge if they followed such a carriage, a flock of travelers and adventurer, as well as merchants were following while maintaining a fixed distance from it.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, \u3010Maizel Walt\u3011 seemed quite amused.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! Because the safety of these roads is so bad, the amount of groups following us like that simply keeps increasing. We\u2019re raising our speed to shake them off.\u201d</p><br/><p>In regards to the ill-humored father, the mother \u3010Claire\u3011 voiced her agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen our precious Celes is in such a hurry to get to Centralle, for them to slow us like this! How could it be\u2026 such a thing would be unthinkable in the Walt House\u2019s territory!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one to sooth such a sullen couple was a lovely young lady.</p><br/><p>An elegant air drifted about her, and even when her age was still immature, every one of her gestures held a sort of captivating charm.</p><br/><p>Her blond hair was tidy, and its long waves let off a fine luster.</p><br/><p>Atop her white dress, she draped a white pelt coat, and the smile on her face held true innocence.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Celes?\u201d</p><br/><p>As her parents seemed to find satisfaction in the smile directed at them, Celes spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am terribly bored.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mother, Claire, began to panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do? We\u2019ve no new toy to give you\u2026 what game do you want to play, Celes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Celes looked at the groups trailing behind the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see the forms of our knights and soldiers saving the people in fear of monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she said that, Maizel smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. As expected a daughter of the Walt House. But if there are no monsters to be found\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To his troubled expression, Celes spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Is it truly no good? Are the knights and soldiers of the Walt House really so unreliable?\u201d</p><br/><p>On her voice that seemed to simply invite in spoiling, Claire glared at Maizel.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear! Do you not feel sorry for Celes!? Can the Walt House\u2019s knights not grant a request as simple as this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I apologize. It\u2019s a request of our dear daughter. I\u2019ll make the preparations at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maizel called out to a mounted knight near the carriage.</p><br/><p>When he opened the vehicle\u2019s window, the knight approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the matter, Maizel-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I get the feeling the group behind us will be attacked by monsters. Celes says she wishes to witness the gallantry of the knights. You understand my intent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the knight\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It will be prepared at once! Alfred!\u201d</p><br/><p>With his long silky black hair swaying, another mounted youth approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresent!\u201d</p><br/><p>What hung at his waist was a sabre, and the manerisms of the young male knight felt quite refined.</p><br/><p>\u3010Alfred Virden\u3011 was his name.</p><br/><p>In swordsmanship, he was Lyle\u2019s senior apprentice, and a man of a clan serviced to the Walt House from its early days.</p><br/><p>The knight issued the youth some orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that monsters may assail the group behind. You are to remain vigilant of our surroundings\u2026 Celes-sama wishes to see our service. Go find a big one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Alfred urged on his horse, and promptly separated from the group.</p><br/><p>Find a monster, and set it on the group behind.</p><br/><p>\u2026 That was Maizel\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>Seeing Alfred disappear in the distance, Celes smiled in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, you sure are a troublesome girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Claire smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all for our precious child isn\u2019t it? Admiring the tales of gallant knights is something all girls are to go through once in their lives. But if they perform well, we\u2019ll have to bestow a reward you know, Celes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire told Celes they\u2019d have to grant a reward to the knights.</p><br/><p>After digging through the things stuffed into the carriage, the girl produced a single dagger.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t look all too expensive, but it was a dagger made of Rare Metal, and bestowed with a Skill.</p><br/><p>A perfect article for such a task.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let it be so!\u201d</p><br/><p>Maizel spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh they\u2019d be delighted with such a dagger. As I thought, you really do understand a knight\u2019s heart, Celes. But just where did you acquire such an item?

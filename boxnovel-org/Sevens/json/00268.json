We have to know just how Agrissa was defeated\u2026 no one here really cares about the Bahnseims, right?\u300f</p><br/><p>His discouraged expression was a surprise for both me and Milleia-san. No, to that man, perhaps that was the correct way.</p><br/><p>The Fifth seated himself on the table, and looked up at the ceiling as he folded his arms.</p><br/><p>\u300eGet close and strike, huh? Meaning the ancestor of the Walt House managed to pull that off. If the Forxuz ancestor who specialized in magic was operating separately, perhaps that witch was specialized against magic. Is that why she was recorded on a Yellow Jewel specialized to Rearguard?\u300f</p><br/><p>But the Seventh touched his chin, speaking with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf that\u2019s how it is, I must remark that Celes in a monster in close quarters as well. I can\u2019t say for sure this makes for good reference. But I really could care less, or should I say, it\u2019s a dubious tale.\u300f</p><br/><p>All three of them showed some doubt at the tale of the Walt House\u2019s predecessor. When I was so mindful of the Forxuz House\u2019s side of it, none of them seemed to pay it any mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, about the Forxuz House\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eHmm? Isn\u2019t that fine? It\u2019s a bit of a heavy reason, but we\u2019ve identified why they\u2019ve served the Walt House all these years. Well, Novem-chan is a memory holder, and her sentiment towards the Walt House is so strong I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s actually looking at you, Lyle, but that\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have to resolve yourself. Rather, our ancestor really was too na\u00efve.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh agreed with him.</p><br/><p>\u300eEven if we spread that the Walt house defeated Agrissa at this point in time, if we can\u2019t prove its truth, it will just be a lie. Even if you prove it, \u2018and so?\u2019 is the reaction you should expect.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth made a conflicted expression as he looked at me and Milleia-san.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m sure our ancestor had his regrets, and I do want to do something for him, but\u2026 if Lyle conquers the continent, and makes it so Bahnseim was the bad guy to recover his honor, that\u2019s the best we can do. But if we do something like that, you know\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The three looked at one another, and nodded. As a representative, the Third opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300eTo be frank, it will be thought of as propaganda to make you look important. Well, all rulers, to a greater or lesser extent, do it to put on airs, and I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s important. But why so late? Is the feeling it gives. In truth, even if we bring ruin to Bahnseim, it\u2019s not like it won\u2019t weigh on our conscience. I mean look, that was three hundred years ago.\u300f</p><br/><p>Once upon a time, it would have been able to take it back and restore our ancestor\u2019s honor. We could\u2019ve worked towards it. But at this point Bahnseim was too terrible to advocate for. And the Walt House was also terrible. Even if we could call it the Walt House\u2019s just cause, Celes\u2019 actions had ruined it.</p><br/><p>The Seventh let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u300eAt the end of the end, if you ask whether it\u2019ll be any use, that dubious conclusion is\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The three of them were disappointed, and seeing them like that, Milleia-san was shaking.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat\u2019s with you all! You got to learn of the Walt house\u2019s legitimate claim, and of the Forxuz House! Just think about it a bit. The Bahnseim House stole your ancestor\u2019s achievements, causing the continent to split and lead to where we are now!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third\u2019s opinion was cool-headed.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo, it\u2019s not like Bahnseim\u2019s the only reason it split. I\u2019m sure they wanted to go independent to begin with, and they should\u2019ve had their dissatisfactions. And just because they were unified, that doesn\u2019t guarantee they would be happy.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, it\u2019s that. Lyle\u2026 to clear our ancestor\u2019s lingering regret, there\u2019s no helping it but to destroy the Bahnseim house. Think of it like that, and it\u2019ll be a load off your mind. And isn\u2019t that fine for now? Rather, could it be the name Lyle is\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh hit his hands together as if remembering something.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhen my son and his wife were troubled over thinking up a name, they went to consult with the Forxuz House! Well, isn\u2019t that fine. In such a long history, there are sure to be some name overlaps somewhere.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third smile.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right, but\u2026 heavy. You\u2019re heavy, Forxuz House! But you did look after us, so we should at least overlook that much. Lyle, that\u2019s how it is, so look after Novem-chan, won\u2019t you?\u300f</p><br/><p>What is this, I don\u2019t even. Not just in a lifetime, their treatment of a clan that spent every generation serving the Walt Hosue was way too light.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, just what should I say next I see Novem?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fifth to me.</p><br/><p>\u300eThink over it yourself. Rather, if you love her, accept her. Though if she\u2019s looking at you, or through you to the Walt House, and that hero of the past, who can say.\u300f</p><br/><p>When you put it like that, it\u2019s true Novem permitted a harem, and some parts of her sense of values were different. No, if she was truly looked at me as a royal line\u2026 then I\u2019m curious to how she sees me as an individual.</p><br/><p>The Third sighed.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh~ I really thought we\u2019d learn Agrissa\u2019s weakness from that you know. Just the right moment for it to avoid the question. What\u2019s this, when I had my expectations up.\u300f</p><br/><p>Shaking in rage, Milleia-san moved, instantly drew a gun, and discharged it. The bullet hit the Third head on\u2026 or not. The bullet embedded into the chair he had been sitting in, and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Within the Jewel. In the round table room, only his voice was audible.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, don\u2019t be so angry. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re saying Milleia-\u2018chan\u2019 is useless or anything like that. Just looking at the result, you weren\u2019t any use, but you\u2019re cute, so I\u2019ll forgive it. C\u2019mon, my dear granddaughter.\u300f</p><br/><p>As he riled, Milleia-san directed a vexed expression around.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 The Randbergh House.</p><br/><p>A lineage that had become a knight House during the Walt Third Generation Head\u2019s time.</p><br/><p>They had served as vassal knights to the Walts generation after generation, and had even gotten a daughter of it married in. A firm house, even in the Walt\u2019s territory, enough that once the Walt House had moved its manor to manage its expanded territory, they were left to look after what was left.</p><br/><p>A knight Lyle admired, \u3010Vail Randbergh\u3011 was the second son of the present head of the House. Right now, he was serving at the Walt House Manor, under Celes\u2019 influence.</p><br/><p>To the current head, Novem spoke.</p><br/><p>This was a vital land to the Forxuz House, one that even Celes was too wary to lay hand upon.</p><br/><p>The head wasn\u2019t under her influence.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That is the present situation, Randbergh-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man passed his fifties had conspicuous wounds over his body. Many from war, and perhaps his body would no longer moved as he willed it, as he carried a staff.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t keep me company when I came by the mansion, but I never thought it would have gone so bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Covering his face with both hands, the Randbergh House head looked dispirited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true the state of the mansion was strange. I\u2019ve confirmed it as well. But with my younger brother by their side, I never thought it would\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To Novem, the Randbergh House was a trustworthy one with high loyalty. Worthy of sheltering Lyle, and managing the land once raised by the First.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Novem had dropped by this land. To confirm Celes had done as promised, and not lain a hand on it.</p><br/><p>Novem lowered her head towards the head.</p><br/><p>\u201cRadbergh-sama, could you lend some soldiers for Lyle-sama\u2019s sake? At present, the force he can move himself is much too small.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Randbergh House head nodded. But at the same time, he called a youth to the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. We Randberghs have a debt to the Walt House. If it will help Lyle-sama stand, I will send troops. But my body no longer listens to me. Baldoir, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>A youth called Baldoir entered the room. He was tall in stature, his tidy brown hair silkily extending to his back.</p><br/><p>His emerald eyes were sharp, while his body was trained.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaldoir, you heard our conversation, right? Go serve under Lyle-sama. I\u2019ll send people from the territory. Take at least three hundred with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the Randbergh House head\u2019s words, the man called Baldoir looked a little surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree hundred? Father, at present, even two hundred and the territory\u2019s management will be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His father raised his staff a little, before hitting it into the floor. There, Baldoir closed his mouth.</p><br/><p>To Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy apologies. It seems he doesn\u2019t understand the severity of the matter. But Baldoir has gone through his first campaign, and from the eyes of a parent, he\u2019s a skilled one. He\u2019s a little inexperienced, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be useful. It\u2019s just, for us, three hundred is the limit. We\u2019ll do our best to prepare some youths with power, but with me alone, I can\u2019t send out any more troops.\u201d</p><br/><p>From Novem\u2019s point of view, she was counting on around two hundred. Even that was more than a tenth of the military force of the territory. With three hundred, it was a number that would bring problems to the rule.</p><br/><p>But now, she wanted as many troops as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy deepest gratitude. Then we will be heading south. There, we\u2019ll enter Djanpear, and take a ship to South Beim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baldoir was a little surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom Djanpear to Beim? The eastern front has grown flurried, and a war is starting there, correct? Understood. I shall prepare at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>With brisk movements, he left the room.</p><br/><p>Novem watched off his back, and recalled the Fifth\u2019s daughter once sent to this house as a bride.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 All is for Lyle-sama\u2019s sake.)</p><br/><p>But no one could tell which Lyle she spoke of\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Adele heard the report from the Valkyries she\u2019s brought alone, and held her head.</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s party had gotten cooperation from Faunbeux, and had even taken in the Margrave of Resno managing the border.</p><br/><p>Novem\u2019s unit had attained Djanpear\u2019s cooperation, and the surrounding countries were currently negotiationg with Jules.</p><br/><p>And yet, Adele side was small, one that could crumble at any moment. She hadn\u2019t gotten any significant results.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I should have attempted larger houses.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one comforting a depressed Adele was Maksim.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilady, it isn\u2019t all bad things. Looking to results, we have gotten several thousand troops on our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those several thousand, to be precise, fell short of five thousand. If things went poorly, there was a fear it would drop below three thousand.</p><br/><p>Adele didn\u2019t know just how much assistance the feudal lords would offer. Perhaps there were some thinking to betray as well.</p><br/><p>When she reported as such to Lyle, the Valkyries expressionless relayed his response.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that fine? You\u2019ve handed the item in question to the trustworthy lord. Even if a traitor comes out, there isn\u2019t a problem. Lyle-sama is delighted the preparations are getting together. Hah, why wasn\u2019t I stationed closer to Lyle-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking that last bit was unnecessary, Adele prepared to return to South Beim. These days, she had it rough consulting on the worries and complaints of small-time feudal lords.</p><br/><p>Understanding the reason Lyle had got his hands on such a large-time lord, Adele discussed with Maksim on what was to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaksim, seeing the rise in the cost of living, and the gathering of troops in the east, what do you think? By the time they flow into Beim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The harvest will be over, and it will be winter. A little longer, they\u2019ll be ready to make their march on Beim. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t even be two months before they arrive at Fortress Redant.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Maksim said it with confidence, Adele nodded in relief. With that much time, she could move to Djanpear, take a ship from there, and return to South Beim.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo how long will the fortress hold? From my point of view, I\u2019m sure Beim has reinforced it, and their military force has increased, so over two months is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After she\u2019d said that much, Maksim spoke to her with a serious face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Milady, Fortress Redant will only hold a few weeks. At soonest, it will be breached within a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t believe those words.</p><br/><p>But Maksim had much experience in war, and he was a man proficient as a knight. On these sorts of fields, she trusted his words. And she trusted the man as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve reinforced, and the troops stationed will be much greater than when we were there. Even so, a few weeks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. If it were Lyle-dono, perhaps he\u2019d be able to turn them back, but the possibility the pain would be split both ways would be high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele wanted to know the reason. Simply because Beim had strong adventurers. If those adventurers were stationed, they should be able to fight to a certain extent. Adele had watched Lyle, so she thought as such.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard they\u2019ve plenty of skilled adventurers to spare, though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the hard part. Skilled in that sense means skilled in small platoons, and not skilled under the banner of a large legion. And it\u2019s hard to say they could establish uniformity. Even if a low-level general of Bahnseim led the army, I think they\u2019ll be able to breach in a few weeks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Lyle-san\u2019s time, a pain as it was, they annihilated a legion of monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maksim looked troubled, as he scratched his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s true a monster army is a threat, and they have simple strength in numbers, but\u2026 well, it just goes to show humans are more troublesome. And you seem to be mistaken, so let me offer a revision. When Lyle-dono is leading an army, it becomes frightfully strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his Skills. The Walt House\u2019s head have left such Skills in that blue gem of his, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Maksim smiled. And he shook his head at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his talent to pull them off that\u2019s a threat. And he\u2019s unthinkably calm for his age, disinterestedly moving to solidify his surroundings. At times holding sentiment, at times cruel and cold\u2026 I don\u2019t know another teen who\u2019d move to that level to accomplish his goal. He holds the air of an old general, and he\u2019s a foe I\u2019d rather not fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lyle Maksim evaluated. But if you said that to the man in question, he\u2019d surely make a dubious expression. And the ancestors in the Jewel would definitely rain praise on Maksim. Because it would be as if he were evaluating them.</p><br/><p>Adele could only take in the words of Maksim\u2019s explanation. But it seems she couldn\u2019t understand the deeper essence.</p><br/><p>However, if that\u2019s what Maksim said, that\u2019s how it was, she agreed, and stood.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, in that case, we must hurry and prepare. It shall become busy. Maksim. I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that from Adele, Maksim\u2019s face turned red, as he lightly rubbed beneath his nose with a fingertip.</p><br/><p>\u201cL-leave it to me, milady.\u201d</p><br/><p>Around, the Valkyries looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a waste. That serious air of his.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t there be a problem with their age gap?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a damn chicken that neither exceeds nor falls short of our master. We\u2019ve left the two of them alone so many times, yet let alone laid a hand on her, he hasn\u2019t even confessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Though if he did, at this point, it would feel like a death flag.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele and Maksim, not listening to the surrounding voices, smiled as they discussed their future plans\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

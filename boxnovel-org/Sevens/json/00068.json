I can\u2019t understand Novem\u2019s supremacy in this relationship. He\u2019s not of the right caliber to make a Harem.</p><br/><p>A: Lyle ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cAgreement. But I can\u2019t really hate Novem after she\u2019s done so much, and even if you say I\u2019m no good, I just love Novem. Harem? I have absolutely no intentions of making one. What of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Shouldn\u2019t you start with training personal ability from the start? The ancestors\u2019 actions are all over the place.</p><br/><p>A: Fourth Generation ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cWe thought he was a technique type, but it was only in Part Two did we realize he just took a long time to experience Growth. I agree that area was definitely a strange one, but he was able to master the Skills several times quicker than we imagined, so we kinda just figured, \u2018hey, shouldn\u2019t we kinda put a restriction on him\u2019 at some point. There was no helping it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Lyle\u2019s reputation among the adventurers and the guild is way too low.</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation (\u00b4\u30fb\u0434\u30fb\uff40): \u201cIn this world, placing a correct evaluation on something is not an easy task. It\u2019s because feelings exist as well. Even if you say there\u2019s no gap between male and female adventurers, try imagining Lyle being carried out by a legion of beauties\u2026 don\u2019t you find that irritating? It\u2019s something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: You guys rely too much on those poor Forxuzes. Yet the Fifth suddenly turned them into a vassal house. Is he an idiot?</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation \uff08 \u309c\u0434\u309c\uff09: \u201cOy, yes, I\u2019m an idiot\u2026 there were lots of circumstances going on around the time! There\u2019s also the fact the Fourth Generation had screwed up too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Generation ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201c\u2026 No, but they did raise me up when I was a child, and I became head around ten, right? What\u2019s more, the Third died, and I had to inherit various things, so\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help but rely on them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I have a premonition a Quilin\u2019s going to come out as a heroine. Could it be Novem\u2019s true form is a\u2026</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation \u03a3(\u309c\u0414\u309c\uff1b): \u201cYou think I wouldn\u2019t have noticed dat fluff!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I want to see Poyopoyo\u2019s backstory.</p><br/><p>A: Monica\u03a3\uff42( \uff40\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4)GUH: \u201cHow splendid. But unfortunately\u2026 I was first started up when I met that chicken dickhead. Please think of me as being zero years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: You won\u2019t make your swords of the same material as Porter?</p><br/><p>A: Monica (\u00b4\u30fb\u0434\u30fb\uff40): \u201cWell, it\u2019s armor scraps, so if we were to put it to full use, I guess it would be as protective equipment\u2026 if we\u2019re going that far, then I guess buying a normal high-priced sword may be the safer option. If it\u2019s drills, I can prepare them at a moment\u2019 notice, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle DO NOT (\u309c\u22bf\u309c) WANT</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Can the First\u2019s Skill, and the large sword be used freely?</p><br/><p>A: Lyle (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb`): \u201cI could have used them if I wanted to, but due to the tasks, I had them sealed off myself. Because the moment I used them, I would have failed the task anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About Arumsaas\u2019 guild\u2019s treatment, and the punishments. It\u2019s not enough!</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation (\u00b4\u30fb\u2200\u30fb\uff40 ): \u201c\u2026 The guild is currying favor with the Academy, and he\u2019s Damien\u2019s friend. If I say that much, you get it, right? Arumsaas\u2019 guild sees that academy they can\u2019t go against as Lyles ally. So what would happen to a staff member who sold out information knowing it would lead to a raid against him\u2026 there\u2019s also the injured adventures he saved, and others he helped in town, so\u2026 oh, that\u2019s enough of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I\u2019m tired of stories about the resolve to kill. Get over it!</p><br/><p>A: Seventh Generation (\u30fb\u2200\u30fb): \u201cThe resolve to kill? Do you understand why so many such scenes exist? Without that, what would you empathize with\u2026 wait, you\u2019re\u2019 serious about this? Well, if you want to consider this world\u2019s sense of values\u2026 they\u2019re been adventurers for little over half a year\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lyle ( \u309c\u0414\u309c): \u201cShould I bring back the attackers\u2019 ***** with me? It\u2019ll serve as a nice threat. Or perhapt their ***** ****** would be better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem (\u00b4\u30fb\u2200\u30fb\uff40 ): \u201cThat\u2019s heavy, so how about we settle for their ****** or ****? Ah, of course, we\u2019re collecting their guild cards, and valuables.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria (\u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cI\u2019ll definitely never forgive that guild receptionist! Let\u2019s make an example of him. We\u2019re hanging up his *******, alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda (\uff40\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cIf it\u2019s *******, then I happen to be an expert on the subject! I\u2019ll take out his ************* alive, and soak it in his ****!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon (\u00b4\u3045\u03c9\u30fb\uff40): \u201cThat\u2019ll be noisy, so make sure you stuff his mouth first. You\u2019ll disturb the neighbors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara (\u00b4-\u03c9-\uff40): \u201cDo you want to sell off the families of the ones that sold information as slaves? The men to the mines, and the women to the streets. For the children, there are some people with\u2026 special hobbies out there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica \u03a3(\u309c\u0414\u309c\uff1b): \u201cHumans are scarrrryy!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heads of History: \u201dOh my, you kids are still much too soft\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation ( \u309c\u0414\u309c): \u201c\u2026 See? Not a millimeter of empathy, right? If they could do it, that would be scary in itself. If you go to too high of an extreme, it becomes like that. At present, Lyle, Novem, and Aria would still kill in revenge if one of their comrades were killed off. Miranda and Shannon would be a little hesitant to do it personally. Clara has a certain extent of experience as an adventurer, so she may be used to it. There was a need to keep it mildly mild, so it ended up like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation (\u30fb\u2200\u30fb): \u201cTo add onto that, Lyle set it up so they would get annihilated regardless. He was more than resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Despite being a group with considerable competence in using Skills, they entered the labyrinth without adequate preparations, and they were in a situation where it would\u2019ve been possible for them do die off without Lyle even doing anything. Why not put a little more thought into it?</p><br/><p>A: Second Generation (\u00b4\u30fb\u0434\u30fb\uff40): \u201cIf the attacking squad was just a little more careful, it would be Lyle\u2019s group that was annihilated. Story ends there. Thanks for reading.\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation (\u00b4\u30fb\u2200\u30fb\uff40 ): \u201cAnd so what if they had Skills? There\u2019s no meaning if they don\u2019t master them, and we used our powers to put those conceited SOBs in their places. But is that something strange? They seemed to be reliant on Skills, and Lyle was in a state without them up to recently. In order for him not to become like that, we put the restrictions up, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Generation ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cThe enemy had their preparations in place. It\u2019s just that it was insufficient to aim for the Thirtieth floor. By the way, they were taking measures to annihilate Lyle\u2019s party, and on top of that\u2026 we stuck a \u300cDouble Standards\u300d tag onto the story\u2019s genre, so we should be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: You wrote there were some who could stomach magic water out there, so I can\u2019t imagine all of them being wiped out. The ancestors\u2019 stance that it was absolutely impossible is questionable.</p><br/><p>A: Lyle(\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb`): \u201c\u2026 If their remnants would have been able to safely return in that state, I would never have created Porter in the first place. Would a group that was known to have attacked those of their same trade actually cooperate with one another with their limited supply of consumables to aim for the surface? If all that was possible, we wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

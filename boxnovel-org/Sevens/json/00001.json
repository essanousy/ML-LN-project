The tip of it was shaking.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just fatigue. The emotion of fear was also apparent in the blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, hah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sabre in my hands was real. My sister\u2019s rapier was real as well. For us to be seriously going at each other with weapons, I never would have thought it sane.</p><br/><p>However, the one to propose this duel was, undoubtedly, her.</p><br/><p>Wearing a dress, she spoke as she looked at me without any interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still going to continue this, onii-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>While she called me onii-sama now, she usually doesn\u2019t even call my name. \u2018You,\u2019 \u2018that thing,\u2019 and other such phrases were how she usually referred to me.</p><br/><p>But no one in the surroundings ever found fault in that.</p><br/><p>She wore an ivory-colored dress and red shoes. Even though we were both exchanging slashes, unlike me, she wasn\u2019t sweating at all.</p><br/><p>As if she was going to head off somewhere formal, her outfit was well in order. The rapier that sister held in her hands was an article made by a skilled craftsman.</p><br/><p>It was adorned with ornaments, and the hilt was inlaid with a yellow orb. The gem that couldn\u2019t be made anymore in the current era was a special tool that brings forth special Skills.</p><br/><p>The rapier it had been inserted into was a Magic Item, a weapon called a Magic Sword. It was a rare good that couldn\u2019t be bought even with a hundred gold coins.</p><br/><p>With the sword in hand as a mismatch with her appearance, my sister\u2019s standing figure was in a mess.</p><br/><p>This year, she was to turn thirteen. Flowing, golden hair waved on her head. Her figure was, unbefitting of her age, quite voluptuous.</p><br/><p>Her blue eyes stared at me coldly.</p><br/><p>Chills raced down my spine.</p><br/><p>Scary. I wanted to run. But I could not.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. We\u2019re not done yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>I forcefully contained my fear and stepped forward.</p><br/><p>I had faith in my well-trained sword skills. I was confident that I wouldn\u2019t even lose to adults.</p><br/><p>The Walt Family\u2026 in order to succeed our noble household, I received severe training from a young age. I was confident in my blade.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, you sure are slow.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, I was also a prodigy. A wonder child. They always showered me with praise. In order to answer to my parents and my family\u2019s expectations, I desperately put in all my effort.</p><br/><p>But that effort, before the sister two years younger than me, was useless.</p><br/><p>Obviously, my sister was a girl. As swordsmanship was thought of as unnecessary for her, she didn\u2019t pick it up over the passage of years. She was just taught the basics, and all she should know was how to hold it and swing it.</p><br/><p>Even so, I couldn\u2019t win against her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha!\u201d</p><br/><p>We clashed for an unknown amount of times, and my body was covered in numerous shallow cuts. Even when I slashed at her, she easily dodged with minimal movements.</p><br/><p>At the same time, her whip-like rapier blade came down on my face, arms, and stomach.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust then, I could have given you three fatal wounds, Lyle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The name of the girl who said my name with a smile on her face was Celes Walt.</p><br/><p>If there ever was one loved by the heavens, anyone would think it was the sister before me. The only one to truly hate her was me.</p><br/><p>Having my attack dodged, my legs buckled, and I fell over on the lawn.</p><br/><p>My body was covered in blood. My clothes were sticking to me from my sweat.</p><br/><p>My blue hair was also sticking to me, but I didn\u2019t pay it any mind. When I tried to stand, I saw those red shoes coming at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuh!\u201d</p><br/><p>I blocked with my arms, but I couldn\u2019t kill the momentum. My body floated a little before I rolled across the ground once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unsightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, truly\u2026 to think that this was our son, it\u2019s much too pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Where I collapsed were my mother and father.</p><br/><p>We were surrounded by a majority of the retainers, but not a single one directed any encouragement at me.</p><br/><p>(Father\u2026 mother\u2026 why\u2026)</p><br/><p>I wanted to cry. I bore the pain to stand up, and turned to find Celes\u2019s smile awaiting me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could be the problem? Is that all you were, Lyle?\u201d</p><br/><p>She purposely called out my name to provoke me.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. Even when Celes only learned the bare minimum of swordsmanship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really should be Celes succeeding the Walt House.\u201d</p><br/><p>My parent\u2019s words were directed at my back.</p><br/><p>Even when they\u2019re ones who\u2019ll say things like this, they were once kind to me. The Sabre I held in my hands was an item they had prepared for me long ago.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, you\u2019re also a man of House Welt. Only the best of weapons are fitting for your hand.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eIt suits you, Lyle. As expected of our son.\u300f</p><br/><p>They had continued directing a kind smile at me until around the time I turned ten.</p><br/><p>After that, my parents came to dote on my sister Celes. It was around then that they had lost interest in someone like me.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t something limited to this family.</p><br/><p>The retainers, who had always treated me in a way fitting the future head of the household started treating Celes as their lord.</p><br/><p>They spoke ill of me behind my back, and kept saying I wasn\u2019t fit to succeed.</p><br/><p>Until I was ten, the household, and the populace had been expectantly waiting for me to take over.</p><br/><p>But now was different. This was the reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, Celes is the successor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, even if they didn\u2019t do something like this, all we had to do was drive the boy out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when there\u2019s no way he\u2019d ever win against Celes-sama. What a fool.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so mortifying that tears began to come out.</p><br/><p>(Just what did I ever do. Why must I be so hated!?)</p><br/><p>Even Celes was my sister. It\u2019s not like I had hated her. I had treated her as a brother should.</p><br/><p>Did Celes find something to hate in that?</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, you\u2019re going to cry? You truly are unsightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>She began laughing to herself. She looked like she\u2019s truly having fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this! What did I ever do to you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I raised my voice, Celes\u2019s expression changed from smiling to expressionless.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How loud. It doesn\u2019t matter to you. It doesn\u2019t really matter to me whether you\u2019re there or not. But since you became an eyesore, I\u2019ll have you out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what are you saying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She raised her left hand at me, and pointed her finger.</p><br/><p>(She intends to use magic!?)</p><br/><p>Looking behind, I saw that my parents and the rest of the household had noticed her actions and moved out of the way.</p><br/><p>They had given silent approval of her attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Ice Wall!\u201d</p><br/><p>A wall of ice manifested in front of me.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a water attribute magic, and it\u2019s property is \u2018Shield\u2019. In order to be praised\u2026 in order to make my parents turn my way, I had lost myself in training myself.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just in the sword. Magic, and horse riding, and even knowledge\u2026 but in front of the existence in front of me, it was all worthless.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Bullet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Showing her superiority, Celes started chanting magic after I had finished my preparations.</p><br/><p>In contrast to me, it was a fire-attribute spell, and its level was among the basics of the basics. It was also quite a user-friendly one that merely produced a ball of fire.</p><br/><p>The wall of ice I had created was chipped away by the fire all too easily.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just a single shot.</p><br/><p>From Celes\u2019s fingertip, she shot several hundred repetitions of the same spell. Each and every one\u2019s output was quite high, and while my magic was supposed to triumph over it attribute-wise, I couldn\u2019t even win against Celes\u2019s elementary-level spells.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh, Earth Hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>From the ground around me, grew four arms made of earth. Each of them obeyed my will to attack her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes smiled as she used the rapier in her hand to cut them all down. A rapier is, essentially, a weapon specialized in stabbing. With it, she used magic to easily cut them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth Bullet.\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to win with versatility, I activated my next magic. Rocks shot up from the ground like cannon balls and tore up the lawn.</p><br/><p>But I have no time to think about anything like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cShield.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a change in expression, she casted it with a smile. A simple wall made of pure mana completely blocked my Earth Bullet.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t on Celes\u2019s level, but I had shot several dozen shots. Still, not a single one got through.</p><br/><p>(I don\u2019t have any Mana left. I\u2019ll have to end it here\u2026)</p><br/><p>Even I could understand I had no prospects of victory. But I had to fight her no matter what.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, I would be driven out of the house without having done anything.</p><br/><p>What started this all was, as I thought, Celes\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, Father. This year, onii-sama will turn fifteen and become an adult. Is this not the time to hold a match to determine the future head of the Walt House?\u300f</p><br/><p>Normally, males would be the ones to succeed.</p><br/><p>But my parents said she was correct. They acknowledged our match.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe loser will leave the house. That\u2019s alright with you, right oniisama?\u300f</p><br/><p>She hated me, or perhaps she simply found me unpleasant. Like that, my fight with Celes had started.</p><br/><p>Originally, it wasn\u2019t something that would ever have happened.</p><br/><p>Having a girl succeed a household wasn\u2019t something that never happened. But in those cases, there were certain circumstances, such as the basic principles of the family.</p><br/><p>House Walt has had a male successor for generations. From the founding first generation head, a direct line of males have handed down the family to one another.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a household with over two hundred years of history.</p><br/><p>Even so, father and mother obeyed Celes\u2019s words and had the match with me, the eldest son, approved.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles, never, to someone like you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I stepped in, I slashed at Celes with all my might. At my sister, who had the appearance of a frail girl, I cut down at full force.</p><br/><p>From a third party perspective, I would definitely be the one at fault here. But somewhere in my heart, I understood it. My hundreds, my thousands, my hundreds of thousands of practice swings went into this blow.</p><br/><p>The attack with all power behind it would cleave her in two if it landed.</p><br/><p>\u2026 If it landed, that is.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s good that I was able to close in. The attack was the strongest I could muster at the moment.</p><br/><p>But my stroke never reached her.</p><br/><p>Turning half of her body to dodge the vertical slash, she swung up the rapier to deliver an attack at me. As if to torment me, she continued to carve light cuts into my body.</p><br/><p>At this rate, it\u2019s never going to end.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>As my dodged sword dug into the ground, I released my left hand from it and swung up with my right. With the first sword stroke, it traced a V into the air.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Celes\u2019s eyes opened wide.</p><br/><p>It was my last resort.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a skill I had practiced in secret, but still, it didn\u2019t reach her. The blade cut close to her dress.</p><br/><p>(She could even react to that?)</p><br/><p>It was my special trump card, but Celes\u2019s reflexes had exceeded that. However, if you count the cut along her dress, it actually worked.</p><br/><p>(It reached. My sword reached Celes!)</p><br/><p>Looking from the sidelines, the sight of a brother getting pissed off against his younger sister must be repulsing. But as my opponent was Celes, there\u2019s no meaning to that.</p><br/><p>Just see her pretty face be twisted in pain for a brief moment, made it all worth it. We both took a step back, and while out of breath, I raised the corners of my lips.</p><br/><p>This was the most resistance I could offer. Right now, this was all I could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Celes?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked down on me with an expressionless face, shaking. She must be feeling humiliated. How many times have I ever seen my sister Celes truly embarrassed before?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t call my name, filth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time I noticed it, she had disappeared from my view. Her voice came from behind me.</p><br/><p>As I turned around, her fist entered my sight.</p><br/><p>(W-what?)</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any pain. By the time I noticed it, the sabre had left my hands, and I was sent sprawling in the air. Within my vision that seemed to see everything moving in slow motion, it seemed that Celes was the only one moving normally.</p><br/><p>She approached and kicked me with those red shoes this time.</p><br/><p>I looked up at her as I flew through the air and saw her preparing to fire off magic.</p><br/><p>(This is bad, I\u2019ll die!)</p><br/><p>I tried to muster up magic defenses immediately, but the magic Celes fired was a high-class one. It was a magic that required a considerable amount of skill as a magician.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s really coming at me to kill me.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I heard her disinterested voice, I also chanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater Ball!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wrung out my remaining power, and deployed my own magic around myself. A tempest of flames engulfed me and tried to burn me to death.</p><br/><p>I had also activated magic, but I don\u2019t know if this will block it.</p><br/><p>All I understood was that the magic she just used was fired in an honest attempt to kill me.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-am I really that much of a hindrance to you, Celes!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I called out, I flopped onto the ground. The impact rocked my body and pain raced all around it.</p><br/><p>Coupled onto the pain I hadn\u2019t been feeling up until now, the impact caused me to writhe on the ground. And my own Sabre fell beside me.</p><br/><p>The tip pierced the earth, and its metal had turned a dull red from the heat.</p><br/><p>If I grasped it I would definitely be burned, but still, I reached out my hand.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not thinking of anything anymore, but I simply didn\u2019t want to part with it. To me, the blade in front of my eyes was my final bond with my parents.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The surroundings watched me. Without even thinking about saving me, they looked upon me. Looking at me miserably crawling towards it, there were even those that laughed.</p><br/><p>The only one to walk to me was the one with a vulgar smile on her face, Celes.</p><br/><p>\u201cServes you right. Although I\u2019m a bit surprised you still managed to cling to life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, she broke the sword in front of my eyes. Perhaps because of the heat, or her own skill, the sabre was cut through as if it were made of not metal, but paper.</p><br/><p>My extended hand fell to the ground in vain.</p><br/><p>It grabbed onto the grass; I looked up with tears in my eyes. Using her left hand to fiddle with her hair, Celes had a full smile on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that was your favorite one, right? How unfortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked like she was having fun as she happily looked down on me. However, hearing my parent\u2019s words, she turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles, that\u2019s enough, isn\u2019t it? Your clothes were ruined. How about we spend the day buying you a new dress?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that sounds nice, dear.\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a single soul to look at the beaten and burnt up me. They were already treating me as if I wasn\u2019t there.</p><br/><p>\u201cP-please wait! Father, mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>I strained my voice and reached out my hand. But they merely turned their eyes to me once. Their gaze were still one where they were looking at something filthy.</p><br/><p>And like that, I let my head fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>I let out my voice and cried out without regards to the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>I wonder just how much time had passed, but it shouldn\u2019t have taken that long for me to have lost consciousness. I remember myself bawling on top of the lawn, but by the time I noticed it, I was on a bed.</p><br/><p>Bandages were wrapped around my body, and it appeared that I had received some treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust who\u2026 Father? No, that wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not sure if I should be saying this, but father would never save me. There\u2019s the attitude he had when he left me, but more importantly, this place wasn\u2019t inside the manor.</p><br/><p>I looked up at the wood grains on the ceiling, and understood this wasn\u2019t the inside of my own home.</p><br/><p>I wonder who saved me. It hurt to move, so I turned just my head to look over the surroundings.</p><br/><p>I was in a wooden house, no, more like a hut. My eyes turned back to the ceiling. I had woken up, but my body still felt like it needed some sleep.</p><br/><p>Also, I don\u2019t want to think of anything right now.</p><br/><p>(So I was abandoned\u2026)</p><br/><p>Having been abandoned by my family, Celes\u2019s face floated into my mind. Her vulgar smile as she ridiculed me.</p><br/><p>At that time\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026? Who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Around me, the sound of someone speaking\u2026 no more like the feeling that someone was making a speech. I was assaulted by a strange sensation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I feel no presences around me. Thinking that I was mistaken, I closed my eyes.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know by whom, but I had been treated. I\u2019ll sleep for a bit, and recover my stamina. My body felt heavy, and I wanted to close my eyes.</p><br/><p>(Right now, I don\u2019t want to think about anything\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>It probably happened a little after I had closed my eyes. I heard a voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, oy, that means it came, right? It definitely came!\u300f</p><br/><p>Rather than cheerful, the voice sounded violent. It was loud, and it laughed hardily.</p><br/><p>(W-who? Could it be the person that saved me?)</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t looked like my voice reached him. What\u2019s more, for some reason, I feel quite tired. It\u2019s as if my Mana was being sucked out\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eFather, please shut up for a bit.\u300f</p><br/><p>This time, it was a worn out voice of a young man.</p><br/><p>(There are multiple people? Even so, what\u2019s with this uneasy feeling\u2026)</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t let out my voice. My thoughts aren\u2019t getting through to them.</p><br/><p>\u300eTry understanding what grandpa\u2019s trying to say, dad. I mean, it\u2019s our first conversation. And I can feel that a direct descendant is nearby. He definitely carries our blood.\u300f</p><br/><p>This time, it really was a cheery voice.</p><br/><p>(Three? No, there may be more.)</p><br/><p>More than a voice, perhaps a presence. I couldn\u2019t think that there were only three.</p><br/><p>\u300eI get what grandpa\u2019s saying~. First, let\u2019s calm down and confirm it.\u300f</p><br/><p>I heard a new one. Since he said grandpa, was it a family? But all of their voices sounded young, or at the very least, they don\u2019t seem aged.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, it\u2019s our first conversation, you see. But, you know, there are things we wont notice at this rate, I think, you see.\u300f</p><br/><p>(Again. With this, is that the fifth voice?)</p><br/><p>Another one rang out.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re too pessimistic, pops. More importantly, I want to know what became of him. It would be nice if he noticed, but\u2026 what\u2019s up, Brod?\u300f</p><br/><p>The name Brod came out, shocking me.</p><br/><p>I mean, Brod was the name of my own grandfather.</p><br/><p>(This is\u2026 this might mean that I\u2019m dead.)</p><br/><p>Are you alright with that? My inner thoughts screamed, as I strained to hear the voices.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s my grandson! It\u2019s Lyle! There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s my grandson!\u300f</p><br/><p>It was so reminiscent of my grandfather\u2019s voice, it made me want to give a bitter smile. He was one who was a tad bit too soft on his grandson, but even those emotions could be felt through his voice.</p><br/><p>Still, he sounded a little younger. It didn\u2019t have the hoarse tones of an older man.</p><br/><p>Just what was the meaning of this? I thought, as silence spread for a while.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u300e\u300eFor real!?\u300f\u300f\u300f</p><br/><p>What a noisy bunch. All their voices seemed shocked.</p><br/><p>(\u2026\u2026\u2026Just what sort of situation am I in?)</p><br/><p>On that day, my fate began to turn.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

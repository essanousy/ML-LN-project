As Lyle panicked that he wouldn\u2019t be able to enter it like that, Miranda let out a light sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle, at the end of the day, this is a break room, is it not? Why are you calling it, \u2018my room\u2019? The inner palace was built to be your room. You can\u2019t sleep in the break room forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>She called it a break room, but from Lyle\u2019s point of view, it was his own splendid living space. Its make was luxurious enough, and when all was said and done, he could call it nothing but his own room.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no, that\u2019s\u2026 A-a man needs his own place of refuge! Yeah, that\u2019s why, you should just take off these locks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no good. It\u2019s because you keep using this place that you never come to the inner palace, right? And I hear Monica\u2019s teaching you various things in that room.\u201d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s just giving my basic sex ed, or so Lyle couldn\u2019t say. He averted his eyes from Miranda, gave a vague answer and played if off.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, look, that\u2019s, you see\u2026 r-right! Where\u2019s Monica!? She promised to help out with my work\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There, one of the Valkyries accompanying Miranda gave an immediate reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour work for the day should be over already. Recently, you have gotten even better at paperwork, master. Well, from our point of view, we feel a bit unsatisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>His work was already long over. Hearing that, Lyle\u2019s eyes swam around as he thought up an excuse.</p><br/><p>But Miranda was smiling a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so wary. From our point of view, if you don\u2019t come to the inner palace, various rumors will come about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I am sorry for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing they were troubled as well, Lyle repented. There, Miranda looked at him with a bit of worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you properly eating? I\u2019ve less opportunities to see you these days, so I\u2019m worried. It\u2019s harder to get out of there than you\u2019d think, so just show your face and give us some relief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Lyle scratched his head.</p><br/><p>(I made her worry. That really is a problem. I guess I\u2019ll have to head over today.)</p><br/><p>It was growing dark beyond the window. He had finished his work, and thought he\u2019d be able to take it easy for now, but heading to the inner palace and seeing everyone\u2019s face didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll head to the inner palace. You\u2019re exactly right, Miranda.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Then I\u2019ll prepare you a meal too, so take a bath at my mansion. While you\u2019re doing that, I\u2019ll call out to the others, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle was delighted at Miranda\u2019s mindfulness.</p><br/><p>Now that the inner palace\u2019s done, get right to child making! Telling him that just made Lyle more timid, but now he felt a little embarrassed that he was being too mindful of it all.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s right. I just have to go with everyone\u2019s pace, and do my best in these sorts of things. First, just like back when we were adventurers, let\u2019s get used to sleeping in the same room.)</p><br/><p>Feeling a sense of relief, Lyle smiled and nodded to Miranda.</p><br/><p>A storehouse in the castle.</p><br/><p>There, with a special wire wrapped around her many times over, Monica was surrounded by Valkyries. She was made to bite into a special gag, and she couldn\u2019t even cry out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhfff! Mhffffff!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Valkyries were all armed, looking down over her expressionlessly. To make sure she wouldn\u2019t run away, four of them had been put on surveillance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou traitor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGiving our master sexual education, just the two of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow far did you go? Say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat our master was driven so far to rely on this hunk of scrapmetal\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all envious of, and worried for Lyle\u2019s sexual education from Monica. For that sake, they bridged the gap of factions, and offered their cooperation to Miranda.</p><br/><p>Monica cried out in her heart.</p><br/><p>(I-it\u2019s a trap! It\u2019s a trap, my dear chicken!! Run away! Run away at once! You have to get away!)</p><br/><p>Her thoughts for her master were interrupted by a jamming magic tool nearby, and they wouldn\u2019t\u2019 reach Lyle.</p><br/><p>This was all thoroughly prepared.</p><br/><p>Mirranda was showing her serious face.</p><br/><p>For that sake, Monica could only worry for the safety of Lyle\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Monica worried for Lyle\u2026</p><br/><p>(Damn it allll! If things went on like that, that damn chicken\u2019s virginity would be mine, all miiiine!!)</p><br/><p>\u2026 No, she was smeared in lust, and whatever the case, Lyle was in a very dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>Miranda\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>Having taken a bath, in the middle of his meal Lyle looked around.</p><br/><p>The newly built mansion was neat and tidy, the ornaments none too gaudy. But Lyle and Miranda were the only ones in the mansion.</p><br/><p>There were Valkyries stationed outside, and Lyle was worried that they were a bit too numerous.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more.</p><br/><p>(What is it, the food was real thick, or how should I put it\u2026)</p><br/><p>There were lines of things to build his stamina, and Lyle felt a silent pressure from Miranda. He thought he\u2019d bring up some tale of the past, but there he noticed something else.</p><br/><p>He looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t tell them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle stopped eating, looking at Miranda\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? But\u2026 rather, don\u2019t you think the security\u2019s too strict around here? This is the inner palace inside the castle, so you don\u2019t have to station so many Valkyries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, they\u2019re there to make sure you don\u2019t run away. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re guards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle dropped the knife and fork in his hands onto the table.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda stood, removed the clothes on her body, and extended a hand to Lyle. Lyle was coiled in the strings produced by her Skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-wait a second! Miranda? Miranda-san!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda hoisted Lyle up and headed straight for her room. There was a large bed prepared in her room, and Miranda tossed Lyle straight onto it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can call me whatever you want. You can even call me big sis. Even just, \u2018you\u2019 is acceptable. Now let\u2019s do what we came here to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle wriggled, but Miranda\u2019s strings were too sturdy for him to flee. It was a surprise attack. He never thought he\u2019d be deceived so.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Miranda reached a hand for his undergarments, she sent him a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Just count the number of stains on the ceiling and it\u2019ll be over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMonica told me that\u2019s what the man\u2019s supposed to say! And wait, this place is newly built!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Miranda hopped onto him, Lyle raised a scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoooooo!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA man shouldn\u2019t cry like that. And even if you scream, no one\u2019s going to come. My sound proofing measure are perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he\u2019d been enraptured in the spider\u2019s web that day, Lyle\u2026 lost his virginity, they say.</p><br/><p>Sixth Generation Head (\uff1b \u30fb`\u0434\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cL-LYYYYLLEE!! T-to think Miranda would use such forceful means.\u201d</p><br/><p>Milleia \u3002\u309c(\u309c^\u2200^\u309c)\u309c\u3002: \u201cAs expected of my great grandchild!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Head ( \u309c\u0434\u309c): \u201cI knew she\u2019d do it. (Rather, the Sixth has a terrible eye for women. He does have a talent for drawing landmines to him).\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

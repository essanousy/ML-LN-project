Of course, there was a reason.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s for the guild to keep tabs on where adventurers were and what they were doing. At the same time, in cases where one didn\u2019t return far past the designated time, they would take action based on the assumption that something had happened to you.</p><br/><p>We met up with Zelphy-san, but instead of her usual easy-to-move-in clothes, she was wearing a leather-based armor.</p><br/><p>She held a sword and shield she seem accustomed to, and based on appearance, she looked like a knight.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight on time, or perhaps a little early\u2026 well, so be it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san praised us and accompanied us to the guild\u2019s second floor. We filled out a blank form and took it over to the receptions desk.</p><br/><p>The one in charge of our counter was Hawkins-san.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Accepted. Make sure you come back in a timely manner. If there\u2019s a change in your plans\u2026 well, that probably won\u2019t happen, but if you\u2019re too late, the guild may send out a search party for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hawkins looked worried, but we had Zelphy-san accompanying us. It was out of the question for us to become negligent through our peace of mind, but still, we had an adviser with us.</p><br/><p>We probably won\u2019t get into too serious a situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, we\u2019ll just get them to grasp the flow of things. Havin\u2019 you two return alive is written in my contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdventurers must always adhere to contracts, was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, she nodded.</p><br/><p>Adventurers were one thing, but that tendency was strong among mercenaries. I mean, having one that breaks contracts creates quite a great problem of trust.</p><br/><p>For that, Zelphy-san taught us to carefully confirm the contents of our requests.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an important thing as a human. Don\u2019t break your promises, kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, Hawkins-san let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s troubling for us because there are quite a lot of people who fail to do so. Now then, please try your best. As an adventurer, for one to live by the trade, it has to be monster hunting, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, we departed from the guild.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Outside of Dalien.</p><br/><p>We exited through the walls which were about four meters high and walked along the highway.</p><br/><p>We made sure not to get in the way of the carts and merchants going to and fro, and we occasionally exchanged greetings with those we passed by.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou both have more than enough medicine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I nodded, Zelphy called out to a slightly dirty traveler on the road.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? You\u2019ve got yourself quite muddied up there.\u201d</p><br/><p>When asked, the traveler explained his circumstances.</p><br/><p>\u201cI dunno, man. I went off the path for a bit to do my business, and a slime went and attacked me. I was able to block with my robe, but I got a bit burnt up.\u201d</p><br/><p>A slime was a type of monster that existed as a nucleus and liquid within a transparent membrane. It jumped at living things and preyed upon them by dissolving them into its liquid.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t possess much intelligence, so if you approached it, it would attack, but if you didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>They appear en masse, and they were a troublesome sort of monster that brought harm to merchants, horses that pull the carts of travelers, and the like.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Here, use this.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the traveler who showed off his burnt robe and reddened arms, Zelphy-san tossed some medicine. It was a cheap one, but I wonder if it was alright to part with it so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry \u2018bout that. Distance-wise, it\u2019s about two kilos down the road, and from this direction, they were in a thicket on the right. I guess there were quite a few in the area?\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving the information, Zelphy-san waved her hand and parted with the adventurer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFolks who are used to travel understand our circumstances, kid. So as compensation, he paid me with information. I\u2019ll bet there are some who would lie as well, but it\u2019s a road they use for themselves, so they\u2019ll give quite a bit of information to an adventurer out monster hunting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then wouldn\u2019t he have just told you free of charge? I thought that, but Zelphy gave a broad grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle, remember this. Humans work more when there\u2019s a reward. The amount of info you get is the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs\u2026 that so? It\u2019s for their own profit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>From my point of view, I don\u2019t get why they\u2019d be stingy with information even when it would benefit them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, there are some who think that way as well. But as with everything, that\u2019s not everyone. You\u2019ve got to study more about the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, we started heading towards the place we were pointed to.</p><br/><p>I had the reserve sabre I bought on me as well, so I wasn\u2019t worried about my equipment. Also, today\u2019s opponent was a slime.</p><br/><p>If they had the necessary know-how, it was an opponent even a civilian could dispatch.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Just at the right time. Both of you, see those three adventurers over there? Look at them while you walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I turned my head to see a three-man party wielding knives and wearing light-weight\u2026 civilian clothes.</p><br/><p>Even if their opponent was a slime, their mismatched movements showed they had no coordination.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre those men novices?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Novem\u2019s question, Zelphy offered a slight correction.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovices they are. Their equipment\u2019s no good. But it\u2019s not rare to be havin\u2019 trouble with a slime. Even if it\u2019s wide-spread that as long as they had a weapon, anyone could beat one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Within that, the First Generation inserted himself into the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300eI just took them on with the branches lying around, though. If I brought over the magic stones in their skin and core, the old man at the guild would give me candy. Back when I was small, that\u2019s how I would get my snacks, you know? Well, it\u2019s probably impossible for a frail kid like you.\u300f</p><br/><p>It seemed like he was trying to provoke me, but all I thought was\u2026</p><br/><p>(You were being cheated there, you know, First Generation.)</p><br/><p>I found it a little pitiful. Probably because he was too young to notice, they sure made good use of him.</p><br/><p>(And wait, defeating monsters at a young age; just how much of a savage are you?)</p><br/><p>But unable to restrain himself, the Second raised a loud laugh as he paraded around the fact.</p><br/><p>Just when I had decided to keep it to myself, it looks like my kindness had no meaning.</p><br/><p>\u300eGyahahaha! Candy in exchange for monster materials, you say? Just how much were they ripping you off!? Ah, my stomach\u2019s starting to hurt~.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eW-what!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eEven in my time, it was several coppers. You could have bags worth of candy with that.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second Generation truly seemed to be having fun as he mocked the first.</p><br/><p>(Just what happened between those two?)</p><br/><p>Among the Walt House ancestors, the Second Generation was remarkably plain. But there was definitely something deep rooted between those two.</p><br/><p>Of course, I do have a general idea of it.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat damn geezer! He\u2019s got a good whopping coming to \u2018im!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s already dead.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third Generation called quits, and the conversation ended there. That wasn\u2019t the case on my side, though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hey, Lyle, are you even listening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had given too much attention to the ancestors\u2019 conversation, and I had forgotten Zelphy-san. With a tired bearing, she let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, then here it is again. No matter how weak they are, if you get hit, it\u2019ll hurt. Also, that\u2019s even more so when they\u2019re usin\u2019 a short reach weapon like a knife. That\u2019s why their hips are buckling in fear. If they surrounded it to attack, it\u2019d be much more efficient, but they\u2019re so confused they haven\u2019t noticed that; another of their problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem looked over at the party of three as she posed a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to notify them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m you guys\u2019 advisor. I\u2019ve already received the money, the responsibility, and the obligation. I\u2019ve got nothin\u2019 towards those guys over there. Will you go tell them, Novem? If you do, I won\u2019t stop you. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust that?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was curious as to what she was going to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose three should take this opportunity to learn it. Learn pain. Unlike you guys, they haven\u2019t realized they need someone to teach them, and that their assets weren\u2019t enough to put together good enough equipment. All the more so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem seemed satisfied with that answer.</p><br/><p>But she turned her head multiple times to look at the three. They looked injured, but they had safely beaten the slime.</p><br/><p>While complaining about the pain, they collected the Slime\u2019s materials.</p><br/><p>I also looked at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think we were cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, well\u2026 a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I gave an honest answer, Zelphy-san smiled. \u2018How honest,\u2019 she said, as she offered an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if an adventurer challenges a monster and dies, it\u2019s his own responsibility. More so if they idiotically over assess their own strengths, and go against a stronger one. Idiots like that\u2019ll just repeat the same thin\u2019 if you save them. Even if you stop them from fightin\u2019 monsters, they\u2019ll still be idiots.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idiots like that were scary, she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, if you keep bein\u2019 sweet on them, there are many who become conceited. Especially in a lower-class job like adventurin\u2019, it\u2019s not rare at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>(Like they\u2019ll say not to stick your nose into other people\u2019s business?)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if they\u2019re not all like that, there\u2019s no way we can extend our hand to all of them either, is what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem voiced her understanding, Zelphy-san told her she was half correct.</p><br/><p>\u201cSavin\u2019 them is easy. But can you look after someone you\u2019ve saved forever? Even if we saved them back there, they could just launch a repeat of the exact same thing. If they were of a little worse disposition, they may even delude themselves to thinkin\u2019 someone nearby would save them when something dangerous happened\u2026 and so, when they\u2019re not goin\u2019 to die or anything, it\u2019s best to get them to know pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, the Second Generation approved.</p><br/><p>\u300eRather than giving them bread, teach them how to cultivate wheat. Truly, there are plenty who would become rotten themselves if all they did was receive bread.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if you want me to put it simply, you guys are amateurs. You\u2019re not on the savin\u2019 side, but on the saved side\u2026 no, you\u2019re on the side that\u2019s still being saved. If you want to save them, then you\u2019ve got to become first class as soon as you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Zelphy-san quieted up and continued to walk towards our destination.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>When we arrived at the place the traveler spoke of, we definitely found some slimes.</p><br/><p>Based on what I could see alone, I was able to confirm five of them.</p><br/><p>Their muddy, pea-green, wobbling fluid sloshed around as their bodies creeped across the ground. Within their masses, a core-like, red, spherical item was vaguely visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, he said it was a thicket, but it\u2019s closer to a forest. We don\u2019t want to chase them too far, so\u2026 ah, there\u2019s one.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, Zelphy-san picked up a rock littered around the ground.</p><br/><p>After tossing it upwards a few times, she lobbed it at a slime.</p><br/><p>The slime it hit\u2019s movements became flurried.</p><br/><p>It started heading in our direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised it can tell where we are without eyes or ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took out my sabre, and Zelphy-san took a stance with her sword and shield. Novem held her staff aloft.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both quite nervous. Aren\u2019t your bodies a bit too stiff? I\u2019ll show you the basics, so watch closely.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Zelphy-san went at the slime that was heading towards her\u2026 no, that had been heading towards her.</p><br/><p>From the spot she had thrown the stone, she moved ever-so-slightly. But with just that motion, the slime propelled itself at the space she had occupied before.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all that happened, but with ample leisure, Zelphy-san cut through it as it came.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you approach it, it can\u2019t sense footsteps or vibrations, but still, it\u2019ll notice you, so make sure to take it out in a single hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the sword pierced the slime\u2019s flesh, liquid started to burst out of it.</p><br/><p>After a while, the creature\u2019s movement\u2019s stopped, and she called Novem over.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem, come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down. Take out the cask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem handed over the small barrel that was being sold on the guild\u2019s first floor.</p><br/><p>Taking out a knife, Zelphy-san discarded the muddy liquid, and used her knife to open up the skin.</p><br/><p>From it, the core and other magic stones fall, and she put those in a separate bag.</p><br/><p>Into the barrel, she put the skin, and something sticky that was over its surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how ya\u2019 do it. Generally, you got to keep wary of your surroundings when you collect materials. Or the other members are supposed to keep watch for you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked towards me, so I hurriedly offered an apology. But she grinned, and told me not to mind it too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful next time. You saw what you\u2019re supposed to collect, right? You\u2019ll be doing that later, but make sure you don\u2019t use the gloves you use for collection for anything else.</p><br/><p>Hearing her warning, we went to imitate Zelphy-san by picking up rocks.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem should use a knife or borrow a sabre from Lyle. If you beat them with blunt force, they\u2019ll burst, so that\u2019d be a pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Lyle-sama, could I borrow a sabre?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Novem had just finished saying that, Zelphy-san suddenly raised her voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of you, fall back!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had suddenly shouted at us, but I heard a voice from the Jewel as well.</p><br/><p>It was the First Generation\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eGet behind the lady adventurer immediately! No, make sure you protect Novem-chan too! It\u2019s goblins!\u300f</p><br/><p>Goblin.</p><br/><p>A monster boasting a large face and green skin. Their height was less than two thirds a grown man\u2019s, but unbefitting their slender frame and limbs, they were relatively strong.</p><br/><p>Among monsters, they were one of the weaker ones, but they were categorized as a troublesome race.</p><br/><p>The reason being, they were weak when standing alone, but in groups\u2026 in legions\u2026 what was more, they held weapons.</p><br/><p>A certain scholar once wrote that if Goblins just had a little more wisdom, then the world would have fallen to their reign long ago.</p><br/><p>From the thicket\u2026</p><br/><p>A goblin came equipped with a bow, and another leapt out with a make-shift blunt weapon consisting of a branch with a rock fastened to the end.</p><br/><p>Before the rear one could fire an arrow, Zelphy-san swiftly rushed in and blocked it. She shouted for us to fall back.</p><br/><p>The First\u2019s opinion was the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of you retreat and await further orders! I\u2019ll take these buggers out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eYou won\u2019t be able to win. Just shut it and listen to the lady. These guys don\u2019t have too much brute strength, but they push through with numbers.\u300f</p><br/><p>It was just as the First said.</p><br/><p>From the thicket, seven more goblins emerged.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat are you talking about? Show them how it\u2019s done, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>Having been told by the Seventh, I directed the tip of my blade at the goblin brigade. Zelphy-san was there as well, so I called out to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cZelphy-san, don\u2019t move for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Zelphy-san was dealing with them, I prepared to use magic.</p><br/><p>Right now, the Jewel was stealing away my Mana.</p><br/><p>Considering my mana, and the amount of enemies, one spell was my limit here. Truly, there was no helping it if they tell me this wasn\u2019t at a level where I could use it in real combat.</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, idiot! It\u2019s impossible for\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The First shouted, but I still chanted.</p><br/><p>(If I want to take out these numbers all at once, then\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lightning attribute magic rained down on the goblins rushing at Zelphy-san.</p><br/><p>Time to activate, scope, and output.</p><br/><p>Considering all of those, it really wasn\u2019t at a level to put to practical use, I guess.</p><br/><p>The goblins were electrocuted, and sparks flew around them. I took distance into account in my calculations, so Zelphy-san wasn\u2019t drawn into it.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI failed to kill one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking a look at me, one of the goblins in front of Zelphy-san fled.</p><br/><p>It appears the magic did hit it, but it was only grazed. Its arms were charred black.</p><br/><p>Thinking me a threat, the goblin ran in despair.</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san was mildly dumbfound, but seeing its movements, she immediately reacted.</p><br/><p>With a single stroke, she finished it off.</p><br/><p>As I thought, she has skill fitting for her to be a guild adviser.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Oy, oy, was that lightning attribute? So you were a magician?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did report that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, well, you did. Still, magic like that one from before was outside of my expectations. Even I can use a few spells, but if someone asked if I could shoot one at that level, I\u2019d reply \u2018no\u2019 immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>After confirming that the surroundings were safe, Zelphy-san came and asked me that. Looking at my magic, it seems she was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice work, Lyle-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem released her vigilance and approached me.</p><br/><p>Making a prickling sound, the sight of a hoard of goblins lying on the ground while discharging electricity wasn\u2019t a nice one to look at.</p><br/><p>(Come to think of it, that was the first time I\u2019ve fought a monster.)</p><br/><p>The smell was also quite something.</p><br/><p>I grimaced.</p><br/><p>The scene was one thing, but there was also a group of people depleting my Mana as we spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s impossible for you! Was it? \u2026 Pu. Fwha. FWHAHAHA! Did you see that!? That\u2019s Lyle\u2019s ability level! Don\u2019t underestimate the Walt House\u2019s little child prodigy!\u300f</p><br/><p>(Grandfather, that\u2019s embarrassing, so please stop.)</p><br/><p>\u300eYou guys underestimate Lyle way too much. He\u2019s still a magician who carries the blood of royalty, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh gave a crude impression of the First, and the Sixth Generation spoke with a fed up tone to the rest of the group.</p><br/><p>\u300eN-no\u2026 but aren\u2019t magicians those things, right? I get the feeling it was a lot less convenient back then.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second was also a little shocked, but the Third gave some honest admiration.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s quite amazing. It really isn\u2019t at a practical level yet, but if you meet the conditions, you can make some simple magic. I\u2019ve gotten a slightly better impression of you, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>The fourth was also pleasantly surprised, and he was overjoyed that his family had produced a magician.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe results of me pushing myself to get a bride from a viscount house are finally showing themselves! Now the Walt House is a noble family in the truest sense of the word.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth generation was more fed up with everyone else.</p><br/><p>\u300eIs that much really something to rejoice over? Well, being able to use that much at your age is quite skillful. I do see a need to adjust my evaluation of you.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The First Generation was speechless.</p><br/><p>He was silent\u2026 but that was only after he saw my magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Lyle-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! What\u2019s wrong!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I heard Novem and Zelphy-san\u2019s voices call out to me, I fell to my knees on the spot. I was out of breath, and I screamed out inside of my head.</p><br/><p>(You guys should be have more self awarenessss! I just used magic, so I\u2019m quite tired, you know! I beg of you, please shut up!)</p><br/><p>With a simpler magic, three times.</p><br/><p>With one of a little higher difficulty, once was my limit.</p><br/><p>That was my current ability pertaining to magic. If I raise the level just a little bit more, I understood from this case that I wouldn\u2019t be able to activate it.</p><br/><p>(Is it just me, or is this Jewel dragging me down quite a bit?)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

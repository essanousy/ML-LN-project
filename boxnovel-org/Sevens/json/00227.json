Sorry, but I\u2019ll be quarantining you a while.\u300f</p><br/><p>As LYLE said that, I suddenly found myself in the Seventh\u2019s room of memories. It seems I had been transported in an instant, but could that just be how strong an authority LYLE held over the Jewel, I wonder?</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh had been sitting in a chair of the room. He stood and stared in surprise at my abrupt appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t stopped by the Seventh\u2019s room too often. Only ever when we fought, perhaps?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I looked over the Seventh\u2019s\u2026 my grandfather\u2019s room with nostalgic sentiment. Is this how it used to look?</p><br/><p>Whenever we fought, it would usually be in the yard\u2019s drilling grounds, so I tilted my head. I had the feeling he had let me play in this room long ago.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou, even at a time like this\u2026 no, you\u2019re in a mr. lyle state right now, are you? Still, thinking back, you do have a point. I don\u2019t have as thick a past among the other ancestors, after all.\u300f</p><br/><p>As the Seventh sat in his seat, he told me to sit as well. We sat with a small, round table in between us, and on it, a cup manifested out of nothingness.</p><br/><p>The Seventh spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt won\u2019t fill your stomach, but this is a matter of feelings. Have a drink.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cThen drink I shall. It even has a scent.\u201d</p><br/><p>I reminisced over the nostalgic flavor. Even within my vague and hazy memory, I could remember that I\u2019d drunken this tea before.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I haven\u2019t had the chance for a leisurely talk with you. Perhaps we\u2019ll get more chances hereon, but that\u2019s yet another sad tale. It\u2019s because our ancestors have faded away.\u300f</p><br/><p>First, Second, Sixth\u2026 and the Fourth had left the Skills to me, and vanished from the Jewel. Their roles had ended.</p><br/><p>The role of the ancestors in the Jewel was to entrust their Skills to the Jewel\u2019s owner. In this case, me. To teach the Skills\u2019 uses as well, they were existences awoken from the records of the time\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve been making light of your or anything, grandfather. It\u2019s true that I respect you. And some vague memories of you doting on me still remain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Seventh gave a lonesome laugh.</p><br/><p>\u300eI see. Right\u2026 but you see, Lyle. Was I really ever that great?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Growing weak at the knees?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Seventh folded his hands, and gazed out the window. Out the pane was the scene of the two birds flying away.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I\u2019ve tried quite hard. I worked hard not to fall short of our ancestors. But what I succeeded in was only because of the groundwork they laid. Lyle, have you figured out why I\u2019m so particular about guns?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re the future? I also think that as long as the money problem is dealt with, mass production will become the key to victory. Though it\u2019s also true they\u2019re short of a decisive blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Seventh nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Being so close to the ancestors, I felt, and I thought. The real reason I chose the gun\u2026 Is it not because I didn\u2019t want to be compared to them?\u300f</p><br/><p>I sipped the tea, and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat foolish words are those? You manifested Box, and Warp, such incredible Skills, didn\u2019t you? You should have more confidence. I was even wrung dry of this and that by Celes, but I still think I\u2019m definitely going to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Seventh turned a different kind smile than usual at me. It didn\u2019t feel like he was mocking.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf you\u2019ll say that much, it gives me some confidence. Now then, your memory that calls himself Lyle came out, so what are you going to do? Even if you want to leave this room, it seems it\u2019s been locked.\u300f</p><br/><p>It seems the door of memories was tightly sealed shut. Then there\u2019s no helping he be panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just take it easy. It seems he wanted to talk to Novem about something. I\u2019ll have to ask about it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>To me, the Seventh spoke. He wasn\u2019t particularly supportive of her. Of all else, the Forxuz House was something of a vassal house. She was only their daughter\u2026 what\u2019s more, nothing but the second daughter.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle\u2026 are you sure you don\u2019t trust Novem a little too much?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 It was LYLE\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>As Novem was led in, she looked around, and realized at once that it was different from Lyle\u2019s room of old. It had been reproduced by the Jewel, but it was subtly different.</p><br/><p>Those differences stemmed from the existence called LYLE, she concluded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bookshelf on the right. The order of the books on the third shelf from the top is different. Lyle-sama barely read those ones. The placement of other books is also slightly off. On top of that, the room was much dustier than this. Because the servants shirked off on cleaning it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without preparing a chair for his guest, LYLE sat himself on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 It\u2019s because you say things like that, that normal people take distance from you. But no matter what little \u2018Broken Novem\u2019 says this late in the game, I doubt it will make a difference.\u300f</p><br/><p>LYLE understood Novem\u2019s personality. And he didn\u2019t particularly hate her or anything. He only had discontentments at her treatment of Lyle.</p><br/><p>The Forxuz House\u2026 among the clan that carried down memories of the goddess turned evil god Novem, the one whose memories were most vivid, and who inherited an outrageous amount of information was Novem.</p><br/><p>At first, LYLE hadn\u2019t been knowledgeable about that field, but it was something he came to figure out after opening his eyes in the Jewel.</p><br/><p>LYLE began talking.</p><br/><p>\u300eMemories are a large factor that influence one\u2019s character. With happy memories, based on the person, the individual may wish to feel more happiness, crushing others underfoot in the conquest for more. It all varies by person, but it\u2019s a fact that it has influence. So here\u2019s the question\u2026 Novem, do you think of yourself as the goddess, or as Novem the evil god? Or are you Novem, second daughter of the Forxuz House? Which is it?\u300f</p><br/><p>Inheriting memories. Simple in words, but if one were to think of it as akin to their own experiences, then who exactly would they be? Would it influence their establishment of self?</p><br/><p>\u300eBecause of the self-loathing she inherited from Septem, Septem-san sealed her ability to be loved by humans, and served herself out for their sake. She served too much and failed them, but even now, her lesson lives on. So how about you, Novem?\u300f</p><br/><p>Novem couldn\u2019t answer. She was smiling, but she didn\u2019t make an attempt to answer. With something important out of place, and something unnecessary shoved in its space. That was the girl called Novem.</p><br/><p>LYLE knew that. And he even thought she had purposely overlooked Celes\u2019 actions.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo answer, huh? I\u2019m fine with that too.\u300f</p><br/><p>To a fed-up LYLE, it was Novem\u2019s turn to question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you were Lyle-sama\u2019s memories, LYLE-sama. Could it be you plan on reviving Lyle-sama\u2019s memories? In that case, the current Lyle-sama will be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>LYLE noticed it was an important matter to Novem. And if he properly returned the memories, Novem might shatter the Jewel out of anger.</p><br/><p>What was important to Novem was the current Lyle.</p><br/><p>The LYLE of the past was of low priority.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 It\u2019s a sad thing, but I share your opinion. I won\u2019t give the memories to Lyle. But I\u2019ll at least rile him up and pick some fights. There are a number of things I\u2019ve no choice but to teach him. Also, I have to transmit the important stuff. Irrelevant to the will of the Jewel.\u300f</p><br/><p>There, Novem looked extremely delighted. Her expression was no lie.</p><br/><p>LYLE could only look upon that expression of Novem with disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cA splendid decision. Not the memory, grant him your wisdom and technique, and dissapear. Fitting of LYLE-sama, a wonderful conclusion. This Novem is proud of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>And she spoke with a horridly dark smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I think of what would be if humanity were able to make such judgement all those myriads ago, or perhaps even longer, it saddens me.\u201d</p><br/><p>LYLE spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt ain\u2019t for your sake. It\u2019s for Lyle\u2019s. His memories stolen, Lyle was nothing but an infant in a body too large. All I could do was leave him the memories of being loved\u2026 so even if everything was lost, and he was isolated away, I could leave the possibility he would stand up and look straight. He the little brother I\u2019ve left to clean up my mess.\u300f</p><br/><p>Novem raised the hem of her skirt with a smile, giving a light bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this Novem shall be there to help him. LYLE-sama, please hold no need for concern.\u201d</p><br/><p>And LYLE spoke. The largest reason he held dissatisfaction towards the girl.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Novem, that love of yours isn\u2019t something for a lover. That is what a mother directs her child. It isn\u2019t what Lyle is looking for.\u300f</p><br/><p>As a mother, she gave Lyle unconditional love. As a mother, she could put up, even with other women. As a mother, she wouldn\u2019t abandon Lyle to the end.</p><br/><p>\u300eI understand your personality. Though the others haven\u2019t noticed it in the slightest\u2026 a ten-year-old robbed of his memories, nothing more than a toddler\u2026 with a mental age of three, five tops, Lyle was a child even younger than he looked. I don\u2019t think you aimed for that. But as he was, you\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Novem corrected her posture.</p><br/><p>\u201cLove is love, LYLE-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Miranda stuck her knees, and her hand into the ground.</p><br/><p>She held her right shoulder with her left hand, the end of her upturned eyes, a woman like the average of she and Shannon holding up the grip of her gun, loading a bullet.</p><br/><p>She used a number of one-shot flintlocks, handling them quite skillfully. When told to come at her, Miranda thought she would be able to take her down easily, but she couldn\u2019t match up at all.</p><br/><p>The Jewel\u2019s round table room.</p><br/><p>The round table extended out, making a space like an arena. Glaring at Milleia, Miranda vexingly stood to her feet.</p><br/><p>The moment she took her left hand from her shoulder, she used her Skill to produce a number of nets\u2026 a large spider web\u2026 before her. The stitching was tight, and the gaps were narrow. They were sticky and made to disperse force, so if a round hit them, it was sure to stop.</p><br/><p>But the bullet Milleia fired accurately travelled down the gaps in the numerous nets, hitting Miranda\u2019s left thigh on the mark.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh!</p><br/><p>As Miranda fell to her knees once more, Shannon looked on quivering. To her, Milleia spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, don\u2019t shake so much. In this space you get out with only the pain. Or have you come to understand it yet, Shannon? Your eyes are capable of more than this. If you were up to it.\u300f</p><br/><p>Walking forward, Milleia used the bayonet on her gun to easily cut apart the sticky mesh of threads.</p><br/><p>Miranda looked on with surprise. In real combat it had been able to tangle up and render a Land Dragon immobile, threads made of her prided Skill.</p><br/><p>And they were easily cut down.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Did you plan to win against Novem-chan at that level? You\u2019re too sweet, Miranda.\u300f</p><br/><p>As Milleia said that with a shrug of her shoulders, Miranda pulled three daggers from behind her hip. She threw the first one, and following behind it, she sliced with a dagger in each hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s close combat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Milleia grinned, shooting the dagger down. The dagger in Miranda\u2019s hand that is. And with her stance destroyed, Miranda hit a foot into the ground, grabbed the thrown dagger, and tried for close quarters again.</p><br/><p>Physical strength, and damage output, Miranda excelled in every field. She had rapidly stacked up Growths, and she cut forward. Knees and hands, flank and shoulders, she carved her daggers into numerous places.</p><br/><p>And yet none of Miranda\u2019s attacks grazed anything solid.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf it\u2019s close combat, you can win? That\u2019s no good, Miranda\u2026 personally, I\u2019m rooting for you, but you should at least be able to measure an opponent\u2019s strength properly.\u300f</p><br/><p>Kicked away by Milleia, Miranda rolled across the floor.</p><br/><p>Since Shannon\u2019s sister was one-sidedly taken one, she turned to Milleia, and tried to use her demon eyes to touch her psyche\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKyah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 And failed.</p><br/><p>\u300eTouching an opponent\u2019s heart, huh. Shannon, you used that to commit mischief, did you? Wouldn\u2019t you say that naughty children need some punishment?\u300f</p><br/><p>Milleia took a step towards Shannon, and instantly leapt from the spot.</p><br/><p>With her wounds healed up., Miranda threw a few knives.</p><br/><p>She thought over a way to defeat such an unfair opponent. Her Skill was easily nullified. But she hadn\u2019t yet the mind to admit loss.</p><br/><p>Seeing Miranda\u2019s eyes, Milleia smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eCome with me. You\u2019ve got to get used to fighting someone stronger than yourself.\u300f</p><br/><p>Miranda took a large stepped forward, threw in a feint, and closed in on Milleia. She was precisely shot through with a gun\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cDone talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was sipping tea, this time I was suddenly summoned to LYLE\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>I was exchanging some idle banter with the Sevenths, and as I thought, there were plenty of interesting stories of failure when it came to grandmother Zenoire. I ended up laughing grandly as well.</p><br/><p>Especially when towards his majesty, she\u2026 as I was thinking that, LYLE looked away from me on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eHmph, Novem said the current you was best, and that I was no good. It irritated me, so that\u2019s all for today. And you\u2019re definitely never getting your memories back.\u300f</p><br/><p>Seeing him sulk like a child, I spoke triumphantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well! Now then, if I\u2019m going to return now\u2026 could you have my memories ready by my next visit? No take-overs included?\u201d</p><br/><p>LYLE looked at me, and scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe world isn\u2019t so convenient. I\u2019m definitely never handing them over. If you want them so bad, why not take them by force? The current you\u2026 maybe you\u2019ll even be able to trouble me.\u300f</p><br/><p>I laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I shall assemble the conditions for my victory. I\u2019ll mobilize my future wives to surround you and beat you to the ground! As a show of mercy, I don\u2019t mind having them wear short skirts for the occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, LYLE started thinking with a blank expression. And hanging his head, and crossing his arms\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 H-how about garters?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite the greedy one. But garters, huh\u2026 why not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eFor real! Hoorayyy!! I can\u2019t wait for such a joyous occasion.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you better wait! Then I have to go persuade them, so I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I doubt it\u2019ll work out though.\u300f</p><br/><p>LYLE gave a delightful laugh as he saw me off.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

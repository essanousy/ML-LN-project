But the one before my eyes looked to be in her mid-twenties.</p><br/><p>\u300eCorrect, Lyle. But as you\u2019ve seen me in my youth, your reaction is a little slow. After seeing someone\u2019s face for the first time, remember their name alongside it. Weren\u2019t you taught that?\u300f</p><br/><p>I did learn that skill. But I didn\u2019t have the chance to put it to practice in my childhood.</p><br/><p>Hearing those words for the first in a while, I looked at the Fifth in confusion.</p><br/><p>Rising from his seat, he lowered himself onto the round table, and let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhy is Milleia here, you ask? Like hell we know. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so confused. According to the girl himself, there\u2019s a need for you to learn everything, she says.\u300f</p><br/><p>A need for me to learn everything?</p><br/><p>Curious about what that everything would indicate, I sent a look to Milleia-san. Her light violet, wavy hair and golden eyes reminded me of Shannon.</p><br/><p>But her facial features and atmosphere were more Miranda. Body structure also Miranda\u2026</p><br/><p>(Feels like someone took out the good points of those two?)</p><br/><p>If her insides were like Miranda\u2019s, it would be troublesome. If they were like Shannon\u2019s, I would have nothing but pity. Of course, I haven\u2019t the slightest idea what sort of person she is.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, you never entered your own room of memories, so it ended up that I came out here to act as a guide.\u300f</p><br/><p>I looked at the door behind my seat.</p><br/><p>My door was different to those of the ancestors. It didn\u2019t just replicate memories. It had become a different sort of something.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t necessary to our present situation in reality, so I had ignored it.</p><br/><p>(The Jewel won\u2019t permit me to ignore, I guess?)</p><br/><p>But there was another reason I didn\u2019t enter as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m busy right now, so is it possible to put it off to a later date?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a troubled expression Milleia-san looked at the surrounding ancestors.</p><br/><p>The Third spoke with his usual manner.</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, you\u2019ve got a point. We\u2019re busy, so is it alright we put it on hold? At this point, even if you tell us it\u2019s \u2018everything,\u2019 that\u2019s a bit troubling.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth corrected the positioning of his glasses.</p><br/><p>\u300eI do want to listen to the wishes of my granddaughter, but it\u2019s low on the priority list.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh, slightly bothered.</p><br/><p>\u300eEven if it\u2019s auntie\u2019s request, that\u2019s impossible. Because we\u2019re busy.\u300f</p><br/><p>I just realized that would make her the Seventh\u2019s aunt. Milleia-san looked at the Fifth.</p><br/><p>He scratched his head.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you want to get Lyle to do. If it benefits our side, I will prioritize it.\u300f</p><br/><p>There, Milleia-san smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eAs I thought, you sure are kind, father. Even so, these memories of the heads of history are truly troubling. It\u2019s a little sad how you\u2019ve twisted the meek Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>And how exactly should I react to that?</p><br/><p>(If you\u2019re dealing with these ancestors, you\u2019d get twisted whether you like it or not.)</p><br/><p>Milleia-san stood, and walked all the way to my side. She kindly held up both of my hands.</p><br/><p>My heart was beating, but it wasn\u2019t in regards to the opposite gender. It more like\u2026 a motherly impression.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, there is a need for you to know everything about Skills. Why the Walt House\u2019s blue gem became a Jewel\u2026 and what gems were originally supposed to be.\u300f</p><br/><p>I recalled back to what Monica\u2019s sisters had once put to words in the Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMemories, was it? I believe I heard something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right. Gems and Jewels are nothing more than memory storage mediums. The records of our lives, and even our personalities were recorded\u2026 the recording of Skills was just a byproduct.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing her words, the Third\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eAs I thought. I did think it strange. A situation where we taught Lyle our Skills can\u2019t be called efficient. Then should there originally have been another purpose? \u2026 For example, transferring personality to another?\u300f</p><br/><p>Not in his aloof bearing, he and the other ancestors sent sharp looks towards Milleia-san.</p><br/><p>While I was troubled by them, Milleia-san shook her head with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s also wrong. That is why there is a need for us to have Lyle know everything. At present, many gems have been lost. The appearance of Magic Tools also meant the decline of gems, after all.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh took her words with wonder.</p><br/><p>\u300eMeaning if things went their natural course, gems wouldn\u2019t have been discarded? Could someone be pulling the strings out back?\u300f</p><br/><p>Without answering those words, Milleia-san pulled my hand, and started off towards the door.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, learn it all. Otherwise, your story will surely be left incomplete.\u300f</p><br/><p>Led by the hand, I didn\u2019t put up a resistance, as I opened and entered the door with her.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>When I entered my own room of memories, the surroundings were too bright.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. Milleia-san called out.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is your room of memories\u2026 as well as the memories of the Jewel. The Jewel wanted you to know. That\u2019s why it has reproduced such an unnatural sight.\u300f</p><br/><p>I slowly opened my eyes, and there spread out a town I had absolutely no memory of. No, perhaps a metropolis?</p><br/><p>Looking around, the people were downing drinks and making merry regardless of the height of the sun in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 It started out as kindness. This is the capital of a country of the distant past. A country that fell some thousands of years ago. You know it too, don\u2019t you? The magician\u2019s village?\u300f</p><br/><p>It looked as if they weren\u2019t living any differently from how we lived now, but now that you mention it, there was a bit of an olden feel to it.</p><br/><p>The clothes the people wore, their shoes\u2026</p><br/><p>The ale they drunk was of one single type. The food lined up was all simple stuff. Perhaps I should call it frugal in contrast with its scale?</p><br/><p>(But if it were the past, would it be possible? And why does the Jewel have records this old? The First bought his gem two to three hundred years ago, didn\u2019t he?)</p><br/><p>In the capital that was neither of Bahnseim or Sentras, I followed behind Milleia-san.</p><br/><p>The voices I could hear led me to believe everyone was in festive spirits.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it some sort of holiday?\u201d</p><br/><p>The merry adults. And the playing children.</p><br/><p>But Milleia-san\u2019s answer was difference.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 This a a normal week day for this country. Lyle, can you see that building?\u300f</p><br/><p>In the direction her finger pointed was a building still under construction.</p><br/><p>There, I could see the figures of mud-made dolls working.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking closely, there were many golems working around. But it didn\u2019t look as if there was a magician nearby.</p><br/><p>I walked on with Milleia. We walked straight ahead, and a building comparatively simple in construction to the rest of the metropolis came into sight.</p><br/><p>\u300eYes it\u2019s magic. And the one maintaining this city is but a single magician.\u300f</p><br/><p>I noticed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what became the base for the Magician\u2019s Village story was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 This country. And this country\u2019s magician is \u3010Septem\u3011. The Seventh Goddess.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing Septem, I remembered Celes\u2019 Jewel.</p><br/><p>In front of the simple building, the golems acted as gatekeepers. And as we approached, they opened the road, and let us through.</p><br/><p>That modest estate, while stationed in the center of the city, was small enough to call out of place.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t feel the slightest presence of people within. The only ones working were golems.</p><br/><p>Led by Milleia-san, I entered a certain room.</p><br/><p>There, on a small bed, an old woman lay.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Oh my, how rare. For guests to come for me.\u300f</p><br/><p>The kind-looking old woman lay down with a weakened figure. Even so, she looked at us with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? She can see us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Milleia-san nodded, and brought over two chairs from the other side of the room</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, if you don\u2019t sit, Septem-sama won\u2019t be able to calm down.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, no, um\u2026 Septem-sama? H-huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I had thought Septem was the one behind the curtains. Thought I wasn\u2019t sure whether she was manipulating her, or an accomplice. But I couldn\u2019t imagine this kind-looking person as Celes.</p><br/><p>\u300eCould you please sit? You\u2019re making me feel sorry.\u300f</p><br/><p>A withered slenderness, her hair was white, and there was a glimmer in her violet eyes. But perhaps her body couldn\u2019t keep up with that glimmer, as she wasn\u2019t moving.</p><br/><p>A golem entered the room, and fiddled with the old woman\u2026 Septem\u2019s bed, raising the upper half of her body so she could talk with us.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t understand anything yet. I am Septem\u2026 no, one who inherited her memories. I carried on the memories of a goddess.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that only deepened my confusion. Milleia-san gave an explanation for my sake.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, you know the stories of goddesses and evil gods, don\u2019t you? Of them, who is it that is the most revered?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber seven\u2026 the last goddess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Both magic and Skills were something the Seventh Goddess granted to humans. And gems were developed by this Septem-sama over here.\u300f</p><br/><p>I looked at Septem with surprise. Her grinning face definitely didn\u2019t look like that of a person who would do evil.</p><br/><p>Milleia-san continued on.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe Walt House\u2019s gem. It\u2019s an original she made. Many others are just imitations made by Agrissa\u2026 no, perhaps she copied the original to make something more complete. Such is the Jewel Celes holds. For that sake, she produced countless gems, so they ended up catching on three hundred years ago.\u300f</p><br/><p>Septem looked at me apologetically.</p><br/><p>\u300eI never thought the gems I made were to be used like that in the future. I\u2019m sorry, Lyle. It seems those girls were right.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cThose girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen I responded, Septem spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Nihil, Octo, and Novem\u2026 one isn\u2019t spoke of, and the others were made evil gods of. \u300f</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Novem\u2026 and even Nihil. So you mean to say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Milleia-san spoke to me.</p><br/><p>\u300eNovem is the same as Septem-sama. She should have carried on the memories of a goddess. Of course, from the world\u2019s point of view, that would be an evil god.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that truth, I received a light shock.</p><br/><p>(No, if you know this and that, then say it, Novem.)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Inside the Jewel.</p><br/><p>When I exited the door with Milleia-san, the Ancestors were waiting for us.</p><br/><p>The Fifth looked at my expression.</p><br/><p>\u300eSo did you learn something?\u300f</p><br/><p>I nodded, but it\u2019s not like I learned everything. It seems there was more she wanted to tell me, but Milleia called for a pause.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis and that. Like how Novem carries on a goddess\u2019 memories. Of how Novem\u2019s clan carries the blood of a goddess, and how the Walt House\u2019s Jewel is an original. Stuff like that. And it seems the one who made the gem was Septem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 No, if you don\u2019t explain it properly, we won\u2019t understand it, you know?\u300f</p><br/><p>Milleia-san looked over the ancestors.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, return to reality. I\u2019ll explain the rest.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll leave it to you. And wait, it\u2019s a bit too much of a shock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Milleia-san looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m sure Novem has her circumstances. So don\u2019t blame her for it. I\u2019m sure that girl will serve you, even if you reject her. But that would be much too pitiful to watch.\u300f</p><br/><p>I immediately\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate her, you know? But when I think of who she is, does that mean I\u2019m actually loved by a goddess\u2026 that sort of thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Milleia-san\u2019s eyes opened wide, and she put both hands to her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Lyle, you\u2019re being corrupted too much by your ancestors.\u300f</p><br/><p>The seventh, perhaps protesting against that opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat are you talking about, auntie? This is just how men of the Walt House are.\u300f</p><br/><p>The ancestors gave some, \u2018Right, right\u2019 s before laughing amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>When I opened my eyes, I was in an inn at the harbor.</p><br/><p>Opening my eyes in our rented room, I saw that night had already come to a close. Nearby, by my awakening, Monica activated.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve gotten up faster than usual today. Good grief, please think of the troubles of your maid. What a bothersome chicken dickwad you are. But I love that part of you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her behave as usual, I felt a little relieves.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry about that. Today\u2019s our departure, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica moved, took up a bucket, began producing tools from between her apron and skirt, and began filling the bucket with hot water.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ve confirmed it with Vera-san, so there is no doubt about it. It seems there is a lot of cargo to carry to Beim on this voyage. They\u2019re quite busy. Because of that, they were unable to meet the queen of Cartaffs, or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by or something? Well, I can understand them being busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeither side could make time for the other. This country\u2019s queen is quite busy as well\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be you\u2019re thinking of adding her to the harem? I\u2019ll follow you no matter how much a scumbag you may be, but going after a queen will make even I question your preferences. Damn masochist!\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt I was being made fun of, so I stood, and refuted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong! No, I just thought it would be nice if I could meet her.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had thought to ask for cooperation against Celes. I didn\u2019t have any other goals.</p><br/><p>Having been dispatched from Beim to Cartaffs on a Guild request, the Land Dragons subjugated, we were going to return right back to Beim.</p><br/><p>We had to go a considerable distance, and by the time we returned to the port, the ship we planned to board was to depart in a few days.</p><br/><p>We did the job in time, but there were other things that bothered me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Those attackers. \u3010Larc Maillarde\u3011, was it? According to the rumors, it seems his actions are so varied it\u2019s hard to get a hold on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>We identified their identity and aim. But without evidence, we couldn\u2019t take legal action against them; what\u2019s more, we couldn\u2019t even find out where they\u2019d disappeared to.</p><br/><p>The information we gathered- \u2018incorrigible,\u2019 \u2018sociable,\u2019 \u2018good tempered,\u2019 \u2018garbage,\u2019 \u2018the adventurer I want to grow up to be\u2019- were just as varied.</p><br/><p>From the consistently high evaluations he received from woman, it could be concluded he had a Skill that worked on the opposite gender.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something we could deal with in the few days before we left Cartaffs. It left some lingering regret, but if we didn\u2019t go to Beim, we wouldn\u2019t get a reward for our work.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the time to care for Larc, I guess. There are plenty of problems we\u2019ll have to resolve once we get back as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica carried out the morning preparations as she answered to my opinion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe money problem is a major one. But I, Monica, am willing to work without wages, I won\u2019t abandon you like those other bitches out there. It\u2019s fine if you praise me more, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 can\u2019t even move if you don\u2019t get Mana from me, right\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Our usual morning conversations ended, and I washed my face, and accepted a towel from her.</p><br/><p>Outside the window, the morning sun was quite pretty.</p><br/><p>A large number of boats were lined at the harbor, and a magnificent view spread out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, once we get back, it will get bust again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem\u2019s case, and Septem, and Jewels\u2026</p><br/><p>There\u2019s quite a bit going on, but can\u2019t fixate myself on those for now.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019ll have to learn a lot of things. And I\u2019ll ask Novem once I learn them\u2026 there are plenty of things to do until then.)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

A few screws in his head were just a tad bit loose, but that\u2019s what made him a Great, after all.</p><br/><p>The other members of the Seven Great, dispersed through history, were all geniuses, but individuals with problems here and there. Damien wanted to create his perfect ideal woman, or so the pervert said, as he pressed on in his research.</p><br/><p>In the research laboratory, maids with the same faces and clothing were carrying out cleaning, and they prepared tea for the two knights.</p><br/><p>Damien sat on his sofa, took the letter, and extracted a small black board from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that one was for the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>A maid\u2026 an automaton accepted it, and put the board in her pocket. Suddenly, her red eyes began to flicker\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It contains data left behind by our sisters captive in the Labyrinths. The corruption is severe, and it is impossible to analyze all of it. Master, it seems that useless Monica managed to lay hands on one of the world\u2019s secrets in a Labyrinth of Beim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the knights made surprised expressions. But Damien calmly sipped his tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019m not really interested in that anymore. I mean, it\u2019s irrelevant to my research. But this truly is troubling.\u201d</p><br/><p>With surprise and amazement, the knights confirmed with Damien.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, troubled? You mean to say you cannot pass on Porter\u2019s craft to us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Damien removed his glasses, and rubbed the inner corners of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll teach you. It\u2019s a bygone art already. If you drop some money by the academy, I think they\u2019ll kind and gently teach you too. Of course, the one who formed the base for it was Lyle. It would\u2019ve just been faster to get it from Lyle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two knights exchanged glances. They seemed quite troubled. It was never even considered that Lyle was the developer.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo then what is it that\u2019s troubling you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Damien put the glasses back on, and smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle\u2019s little sister Celes, you see. She\u2019s coming to Arumsaas in the near future. No, it truly is troubling. Troublingly enough\u2026 it seems that her target is me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Lyle\u2019s letter, he had detailed the threat of Celes. He wrote it as a warning, but there really wasn\u2019t anything that Damien could do.</p><br/><p>So Damien stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be easier to procure the necessary materials in Beim than here, right? And the academy hasn\u2019t been feeling too great as of late. Come to think of it, maybe it\u2019s because all the important members left for Centralle? Ahahaha, it\u2019s just as Lyle said.\u201d</p><br/><p>After bursting into laughter, Damien addressed the two knights once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re running. No. 1, No. 2, No. 3\u2026 pack up my things, we\u2019re going to Beim. Those two are our guards.\u201d</p><br/><p>The maids grabbed the hems of their skirts, and lightly lifted them to curtsy.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, Master. With that, we\u2019ll be able to fulfill Monica\u2019s request.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damien tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cRequest? What did she ask for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The maid named No. 1 spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cA design for a humanoid golem for combat, as well as the development of a golem that makes use of automaton cores. The reward is ancient technology\u2026 option slots for us. That incompetent. She said she\u2019d toss over whatever she had duplicates of, so we had to assist her. We shall pummel her into the ground with our newly polished teamwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damien touched his hand to his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Lyle. He\u2019s doing interesting things, I see. Right. Let\u2019s have him take care of us. Okay, prepare to leave at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Damien said that, the maids quickly began to rush about the research lab.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one\u2019ll go on the large-scale transport Porter\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to show our power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, leave the golem\u2019s preliminary design to us. Master can develop the device to incorporate the cores\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two knights who had come all the way to Arumsaas were dumbfounded by Damien\u2019s prompt decision to leave, and all they could do was watch\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Beim\u2019s Eastern Guild Branch.</p><br/><p>In it stood a robed group of two.</p><br/><p>One of them let her light-blue hair show from under her hood.</p><br/><p>The small and slender girl\u2019s name was \u3010Adele Belgi\u3011. The girl of seventeen had drifted from Dalien in Bahnseim to Arumsaas, to Centralle, and all the way to Beim.</p><br/><p>The one standing to protect her from the waves of people was a tall young man. He carried his spear wrapped in a cloth, and he had a sword at his waist as well.</p><br/><p>His weapons and build made him out as a warrior at a glance, and those around tried to avoid brushing up against hum.</p><br/><p>His name was \u3010Maksim Danhel\u3011\u2026 twenty seven years old, and a former vassal knight, he had followed his feudal lord\u2019s daughter Adele for protections sake, and come with her to Beim.</p><br/><p>The two of them took in the scenery around the East Branch.</p><br/><p>Adele\u2019s green eyes watched the passing adventurers. When she couldn\u2019t find the one she was looking for among them, she sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, it\u2019s impossible. There are too many people in Beim.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Adele gave up, Maksim spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only just arrived. Giving up won\u2019t get us anywhere, Adele-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Adele nodded to him, and smiled. Maksim\u2019s face reddened a bit, and he scratched it with his fingertip.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s no doubt he is somewhere here. We have to locate him at all costs\u2026 Mr. Lyle Walt, former Wonder Child of the Walt House.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>Maksim\u2019s brow also moved a bit. His long brown hair was pushed all back at the forehead, and his red eyes took in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cDalien, Arumsaas, Centralle\u2026 there\u2019s no lack of stories about him. Perhaps he\u2019s become famous here as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maksim spoke as he looked around, and Adele touched her thumb to her mouth, and looked down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping. Eradicating a bandit brigade in Dalien, and breaching the fortieth floor of Arumsaas\u2019 Labyrinth with the lowest recorded numbers. The battle of brother and sister in Centralle\u2026 I really do pray he\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Maksim\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are plenty of strange rumors around him. But it\u2019s thinkable that he came to Beim in order to flee. What could you be expecting of such a man, milady?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele looked up at the sky. She took off her hood, and let her light-blue hair out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, is it\u2026 no, well, I\u2019ll follow you to the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maksim sounded tired, but Adele spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy family turned strange after meeting Celes. They should have been protesting in Centralle, but when I returned home, they suddenly wished to take part in its civil war. It\u2019s clearly strange. I thought it would be dangerous to meet her directly. That\u2019s why I grasped for the clues, and came all the way here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele turned her face to Maksim.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe knights you\u2019ve called your best of friends have been struck dead as well. Those that were once the prominent knights of Bahnseim are of no match at all. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re in the fairy tales of three hundred years passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele who spoke of fairy tales let out a sigh towards the East Branch, and began walking off. Matching her small stride, Maksim followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do feel sorry, Maksim, but let\u2019s become adventurers of Beim. Here, we can probe for information on Lyle Walt.\u201d</p><br/><p>To knights, at least in Bahnseim, becoming an adventurer pretty much indicated you failed in life. But Maksim smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is your wish, milady.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said that with a smile\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026 what the hell is \u3010Holy Knight of Judgement\u3011 supposed to mean!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the temple of Zayin\u2019s capital, in the room I had been afforded, I slammed both my hands on the table a number of times.</p><br/><p>I took down the knight captain, and was waiting for the war to come to an end. That\u2019s how it should have been, when Eva suddenly came up to me with a smile.</p><br/><p>Eva the singer informed me of the stories she\u2019d been telling around the capital.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also the \u3010Blue Holy Knight\u3011, the \u3010Holy Knight of Love\u3011, and the \u3010Guardian of Miracles\u3011. By the way, the story has two different routes for Thelma-san and Aura-san as heroines. An immoral love that crosses the boundary of age! A huge hit among middle aged woman! In Aura-san\u2019s case, it\u2019s just mainstream, so it\u2019s plainly popular. I mean, the war started with only a hundred managed to take down twenty thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>I watched her make a peace hand sign in delight as I pressed both my hands against my head. And the one to enter next was Clara.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-san, the truth is there was something I wanted to ask you about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned to her with an enervated expression, she took a memo pad in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sentiment when you decided to recapture Zayin, and the story of where you snapped your fingers in your negotiations with Lorphys, because you knew the messenger was coming\u2026 It can\u2019t help but feel fictional to me no matter how I write it, so I\u2019d like some more details on the matter. Also, I\u2019d also like the reason you cast aside the fortress you nabbed, and decided to assault the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes were sparkling, and she asked those questions with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>But Eva.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey wait! What do you mean they sound fictional! There\u2019s a splendid reason! In order to save a troubled Holy Maiden, and the people of Lorphys, he stood to his feet! Just because it sounds shady, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to twist the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eva drew closer, and Clara raised her glasses so they caught the light. It was a little scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all to leave records for the world to come! If you don\u2019t make proper records, then people like you will pick, choose, and modify, and come out with a completely different story in the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it!? It\u2019s fine for a Hero to move without it being for his own self-interest! It\u2019s fine if they\u2019re a fool who can\u2019t calculate loss and gain! That\u2019s a true hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s definitely wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>I extended my right hand, and mulled over whether to intervene in their argument, when I heard a burst of laughter from my ancestors.</p><br/><p>The Third sounded quite pleased with my new moniker.</p><br/><p>\u300eHoly Knight of Judgggeeement!! How cooooool!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth even\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eThe Blue Holy Knight, and the Holy Knight of Love\u2026 so you can\u2019t help but be bound to Holy Knight. Isn\u2019t that nice, Lyle\u2026 with this, you\u2019re officially a famous adventurer with a splendid moniker. The work will be rolling in in no time!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026 He was delighted over the money we could earn.</p><br/><p>The Fifth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s better than the Idiot Son and Lyle the Burden names you got before, isn\u2019t it? But Judgement, huh\u2026 why is it that monikers that sound too proper end up ringing out as no-good instead.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh held in his laughter.</p><br/><p>\u300eI-it\u2019s fine, isn\u2019t it\u2026 pff! But Guardian of Miracles, you say? Even when it wasn\u2019t a miracle, but something closer to the preparations you built up. Well, it\u2019s interesting, so approved.\u300f</p><br/><p>(They\u2019re enjoying this. The usual pattern, is it!?)</p><br/><p>With those irritated feelings, I breathed out a sigh, and sat in my chair. There, both Eva and Clara turned to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eva spoke in a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Lyle\u2026 which moniker do you want? I want to tell my tribe to spread it with that as the center. If there are a number of them, it\u2019ll get confusing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara was much the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cUniformity is important. Lyle-san, there\u2019s \u3010Blue Holy Knight\u3011, \u3010Holy Knight of Judgement\u3011, \u3010Holy Knight of Love\u3011, \u3010Guardian of Miracles\u3011\u2026 I think I\u2019ve heard \u3010The Holy Maiden\u2019s Holy Knight\u3011 as well. The last one comes out more in tales with romance themes. You\u2019re paired up with either Thelma-san or Aura-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at their faces, and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll rejected! None are to my liking! If you can come up with one I\u2019m satisfied with, then use that!\u201d</p><br/><p>There, the Third let his voice from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou sure are stupid, Lyle\u2026 these sorts of things are decided by what other people want to call you. You should pick a safe one while you still can.\u300f</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Even when there\u2019s not a single safe one among them?)</p><br/><p>I watched Eva and Clara argue over which moniker was best, as I held my head.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Inside Zayin\u2019s temple.</p><br/><p>In it stood the final goddess\u2026 a statue of the seventh goddess. Looking up at the goddess\u2019 image her followers had arbitrarily shaped was Novem.</p><br/><p>Shannon was assisting beside her, while Miranda, Aria, and Monica were working on different jobs.</p><br/><p>May had gone to deliver a letter to Lorphys, so Shannon was the only one who could help her.</p><br/><p>They were in an important spot, and consecrated virgins were dispatched as well to clean the place.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why am I cleaning? Just when I thought I was being used as bait, I was shoved into Porter, and the moment they let me out, they tell me to clean the sacred temple\u2026 no matter how hard I protest this harsh treatment I get, don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she voiced her complaints, Shannon used a dust cloth to wipe down a bench. Novem wanted to caution her that her hands had stopped, but as Novem had already finished all of her own work, she couldn\u2019t really say anything about it.</p><br/><p>When Shannon turned to Novem as she looked up at the statue of the Goddess, she was a little surprised. It wasn\u2019t even comparable to when she was with Lyle, but there was a slight fluctuation in her Mana.</p><br/><p>Her Mana that was ever stagnant.</p><br/><p>Shannon\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t see, but they were fashioned with a special Skill that let her see Mana. By that, Shannon could act as if she saw just fine</p><br/><p>(Is she angry about something? No, that\u2019s sorrow\u2026)</p><br/><p>And as she watched her, Novem\u2019s lips moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cThings like us as\u2026 gods\u2026 why did humans\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon found herself afraid of that broken voice, and she restarted her work. That moment, Novem called over to her.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, before she knew it, Novem was right beside her, leaning down to match her eye level.</p><br/><p>\u201cShannon-chan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon let out a panicked voice, gathering the stares of the virgins around. But thinking she was just being scolded again, the women quickly resumed their work.</p><br/><p>Novem was smiling. As always, her Mana was unmoving. Too little of anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce this is over, we\u2019ll have lunch, so please do your best until then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 S-sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon could only nod.</p><br/><p>(She didn\u2019t notice? Thank the Goddess.)</p><br/><p>When she thought that, Novem offered a line.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd please forget the words you\u2019ve just heard from me. They didn\u2019t particularly hold any meaning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last nail of the coffin was hammered in, and Shannon nodded again, and again, and again\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Lorphys\u2019 royal castle.</p><br/><p>May met with Alette and Lonbolt in one of its rooms.</p><br/><p>When she handed over the letter in her possession, Lonbolt put his hand to his mouth in surprise. Perhaps Alette was curious, as she sought an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrime minister, how fares Zayin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lonbolt wiped off his sweat, and handed off the letter to Alette. When she took it, she looked over its contents, and opened her eyes wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith only\u2026 with only a hundred men, he reclaimed Zayin, you say? He really did it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked between May and the letter a few times, so May spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I said it. That Lyle brought Zayin down. So he told me to come here and see if you were moving as you\u2019d promised.\u201d</p><br/><p>May didn\u2019t sound too interested, as she munched on the snacks on top of the table.</p><br/><p>Lonbolt spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Attack and overthrow Selva? If it\u2019s now, then even if forcefully, we can form the international alliance we promised. It\u2019s not as if we have to go as far as to bring ruin to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>On that statement, May stuffed the final snack into her mouth, and swallowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was the plan from the start, wasn\u2019t it? And the one that started this was Selva. While I\u2019m at it, the ones who attacked Lyle were people of Selva, weren\u2019t they? Honor your promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>May spoke in a childish voice, but Alette.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what that means? To overthrow is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>May tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwapping out the boss, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>May was a quilin, and you couldn\u2019t say her thoughts were too close to humans. She only thought of wars as something of turf dispute level.</p><br/><p>And Lyle\u2019s opinion was the Fifth, Fredricks\u2019 opinion. May owed Fredricks the debt of having saved her life.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you cannot move, then perhaps Lyle will move on his own. But in that case, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even alone, he would be able to conquer Selva. That\u2019s how she made it sound to the two of them. And in truth, with minimal manpower, Lyle had won over Zayin.</p><br/><p>Lonbolt found that ability of his to be dreadful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hold a meeting. We can\u2019t give a response immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>May stood, and headed for the window. They were on quite a high point of the castle, but regardless of that, she climbed onto it with a calm expression, before turning around.</p><br/><p>Finally\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go tell Lyle you\u2019ll have a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, she leapt out.</p><br/><p>The two watching her back thought about how they never knew how she did it, no matter how many times they watched\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 As Monica cleaned, she looked at the space around her.</p><br/><p>Destruction via magic, and a stained floor.</p><br/><p>As she cleaned it all, a few days had already passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m not even taking care of that Chicken Dickwad, why is it that I have to put so much of my effort in? Recently, I haven\u2019t been able to look after him at all. I\u2019m losing my motivation\u201d</p><br/><p>As unmotivated as her cleaning was, she was still a high-spec automaton maid.</p><br/><p>Her surroundings rapidly grew cleaner and cleaner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI worked hard. I worked really hard this time, and yet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A displeased Monica was quite disappointed that she couldn\u2019t stay at Lyle\u2019s side. There, she saw Aura walking down the hallway.</p><br/><p>She was surrounded by temple virgins, and taking the Holy Knight Vice-Captain Creit along.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood day, Monica. The weather sure is nice today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Creit\u2019s sweltering smile showed that this very moment was the epitome of happiness, as he gave his greeting. There, a virgin cautioned him.</p><br/><p>\u201cVice-captain, you cannot greet people as we move. Because others are meant to open a path for the Holy Maiden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that how it is? Now that\u2019s a pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>And letting out a sigh, Aura waved her hand dismissively.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re not having any of that from here on. If we\u2019re going to break it all down, and make it up anew, we\u2019ll need some new rules. I\u2019ll start writing up the necessary ones later.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she ordered the consecrated virgins, tone aside, she was the Holy Maiden. As for clothing she was still wearing the outfit Monica made, that showed off the lines of her body.</p><br/><p>Behind her walked Remis in handcuffs.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, are you already leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aura nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She\u2019s already dead in Zayin, so it\u2019s deportation for her. She\u2019ll be allowed to carry an extent of her assets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aura hadn\u2019t killed Remis, but Thelma was the same. The Holy Maiden was a decoration and a puppet. And knowing that, neither of them could take drastic measures.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t leave her in Zayin.</p><br/><p>The opposing faction had already been crushed, but there was no saying Remis wouldn\u2019t try a rebellion of her own. So deportation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure are kind. Though I doubt the Chicken Dickwad would kill her either. He\u2019s kind on women\u2026 if only he would be kind to me as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aura looked fed-up as Monica unraveled her true feelings. And a single virgin\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not allow you to speak such rude words of Knight Captain Lyle-sama\u2026 of the Holy Knight of Love!\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica looked delighted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? I\u2019d like to hear more of that in detail. The Chicken Dickhead is a Holy Knight of Love? Should I call it fitting of him, or a bit more than that\u2026 won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Monica as she drew closer, Aura walked off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Remis spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely make you regret this. I hated the country of Lorphys for killing my father, but now is different. Now, you\u2019re the one I hate most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aura answered her words with an unconcerned attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>And cut it short at two words\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Inside the Jewel.</p><br/><p>The Third looked at the Three weapons floating above the round table.</p><br/><p>The first was a giant sword.</p><br/><p>Then a bow.</p><br/><p>And finally a halberd.</p><br/><p>He extended his hand towards those silver weapons, but the Third wasn\u2019t able to touch them. It was as if they knew who their master was.</p><br/><p>The Fourth looked at the empty chairs around the table.</p><br/><p>\u300eOur numbers have gone down.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth hung his head.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh looked at the doors on the walls of the room. The entrance to the rooms of memories. There were now five of them.</p><br/><p>\u300eWe only have five doors now. They\u2019ve gone down yet ag\u2026 wait, what?\u300f</p><br/><p>Five\u2026</p><br/><p>The Third stood from his seat, and looked at the new door that had manifested. The chair in front of it was Lyle\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u300eAfter this long\u2026 no, it\u2019s already been a year. It\u2019s not strange if it came out, I guess.\u300f</p><br/><p>The formation of Lyle\u2019s room of memories caused an outbreak of silence within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>And the Third\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Want to take a peek?\u300f</p><br/><p>There, the Fourth, stood, and pushed up his glasses with a finger.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re that curious? Then there\u2019s no helping it.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth stood as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo, you look like you\u2019re all for it.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh\u2019s seat was closest to the door, so he took the head of the charge.</p><br/><p>\u300eFirst.\u300f</p><br/><p>There, the Third.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, a cheap shot!\u300f</p><br/><p>As he scrambled forward to overtake him, the Seventh opened the door, and closed it at once. When the Third approached it in wonder, the Seventh shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u300eThere\u2019s no such thing as fatigue here, but\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth approached the door.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat are you doing? Good grief\u2026 see, there\u2019s nothing\u2026 hmm? What the hell!!?\u300f</p><br/><p>When the Fourth opened the door with a smile, his breathing grew rough as he slammed it shut. And quietly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eThat isn\u2019t possible. Why? And this is supposed to be Lyle\u2019s room of memories. There\u2019s no way he ever met her.\u300f</p><br/><p>Curious, the Fifth opened the door. And he slowly closed it, and tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u300eHow strange. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t my room, but\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third couldn\u2019t understand. So he opened it himself.</p><br/><p>There, he found a scene of the mansion he had lived in his time expanding out.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Eh?\u300f</p><br/><p>And noticing him at the doorway, a single young boy waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u300eSleigh, today we\u2019re having grandma\u2019s stew. It\u2019s a bit over seasoned, but make sure you drink it all down without complaint. Say it\u2019s bad, and you\u2019ll make your grandma cry.\u300f</p><br/><p>Seeing the small boy\u2019s smile, the Third slammed the door shut.</p><br/><p>His breathing was a mess.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Why is Dewey\u2026 here\u2026 this isn\u2019t my room. And I don\u2019t have a memory like that\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have one.\u300f</p><br/><p>The one that appeared was the Third\u2019s deceased elder brother, a young \u3010Dewey\u3011.</p><br/><p>And he had moved before him as if he were truly alive. It wasn\u2019t the set movement pattern of a simple memory.</p><br/><p>The Third retreated back a few steps, and looked at the door.</p><br/><p>Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh\u2026 the four men stood dumbfounded before Lyle\u2019s room of memories\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

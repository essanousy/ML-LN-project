Taking her favorite dress in her hands, she prepared to receive her father who was coming to Centralle.</p><br/><p>But on the words of the maid who entered the room, Celes froze. Celes\u2019s mother Claire who had been selecting out a dress beside her touched both hands to her mouth in surprise.</p><br/><p>Celes, with the dress still in both her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What did you say? What did you just say!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her favorite clothes ripped, and she took her own rapier-concealing staff from automaton Bert, who stood nearby. The Yellow Jewel buried in its hilt let off a faint light.</p><br/><p>The maid spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-by the reports, the Walt Army invaded Beim. But\u2026 the Walt House Head, Count Maizel was killed in action. The army has surrendered, and faced d\u2026 defeat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the kneeling maid, Celes\u2019 body began to shake.</p><br/><p>(It couldn\u2019t be\u2026 why\u2026 I mean, father is strong. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d lose to leftovers like him. There\u2019s no way that small fry could\u2026 Novem. I see, Novem did it. That damn bitch!)</p><br/><p>Clenching her molars, the force she used to grip her staff increased. There, she heard Agrissa\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Poor girl. You lost your dear father? But you can\u2019t just stay angry. Shall I guess what you\u2019re thinking? Let\u2019s see\u2026 Novem did it. That\u2019s what\u2019re on your mind.\u300f</p><br/><p>Celes hit the maid who delivered such detestable news away with her staff. She dragged the dresses left around the room with her, flying all the way to the wall.</p><br/><p>While she barely survived, she was at death\u2019s door. Celes\u2019 breath was out of orders, her eyes open wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Maizel was\u2026 that man can\u2019t have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her mother crumbling at the knees and hiding her face with both eyes as she wept, Celes embraced her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother. I\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mother Clair clung to Celes. And the two of them shed tears. Watching over them, Bert issued orders around.</p><br/><p>\u201cCarry the injured off and treat her. And vacate the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>The maids moved just as ordered, while the quilin in the room, Rummel just stated absentmindedly at the ceiling as she sat on the floor.</p><br/><p>Agrissa spoke to Celes.</p><br/><p>\u300eUnfortunately, I doubt Novem laid a hand on Maizel. While she may have been indirectly related, that thing wouldn\u2019t lay a hand on him. In that case, the one who defeated Maizel was\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Celes lost the light in her clear clue eyes, a wrinkle gracing her brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damn bastard. I even spared him because Novem told me to. He went and killed my father\u2026 when he\u2019s just washed up leftover\u2026 mere kitchen waste\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Agrissa contained her urge to laugh as she called out to Celes.</p><br/><p>\u300eDo you detest him, Celes? Then why not grant him all the pain of the world? But before that\u2026 you\u2019ll have to carry out your dear father\u2019s funeral. You need to prepare a splendid grave for your beloved father. Right\u2026 to make sure your father isn\u2019t lonely, you should bury quite a few with him. Let\u2019s bury ten thousand people together. If you do, your father will never be lonely.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that statement she couldn\u2019t think sane, Celes noticed.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-that\u2019s right. I have to hold a memorial service for father. I have to keep a grip or else\u2026 mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a minute, Celes. A little is enough. Let me cry for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her mother like that, Celes took action that would surprise any other.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I understand. I\u2019ll wait. Celes will wait as long as you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>If anyone beside her parents told Celes to wait, it would become something terrible. And she felt no discomfort being told that by her mother.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Why was that?</p><br/><p>It was simple. The existence called Celes had a tendency to adhere to its parents. It was the same for Agrissa. But with Agrissa and Celes colored by madness, their thoughts diverged from the common man.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Celes, do you want to be with your mother forever?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do. If we\u2019re not together forever\u2026 I, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Agrissa laughed in the Jewel. Her mouth warping, she spoke to Celes.</p><br/><p>\u300eThen just keep her by your side forever. Maizel didn\u2019t make it in time, but as long as you collect up his corpse, there won\u2019t be a problem. You\u2019ve already gotten full control over, \u2018that skill\u2019. If you use it, you\u2019ll be with your mother forever. I\u2019m envious, Celes.\u300f</p><br/><p>Agrissa, who really did feel jealous, was obsessed with the thing called parents as well. It wasn\u2019t as if Septem alone had an abnormal adherence.</p><br/><p>Celes looked at her mother embracing her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I see. Eureka! That\u2019s right! Mother, with this, we\u2019ll be together forever! Father will be back in no time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles, what are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes made sure not to cause her mother any pain as she pulled her rapier and sliced through her neck. Clinging to her mother\u2019s head, she let the blood pouring from her neck dye her body as she made a delighted face.</p><br/><p>\u201cTogether forever. Forever\u2026 ah, I see. We have to collect my father\u2019s remains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eThen should we put the funeral on hold? No, I haven\u2019t seen one of those in a long time. Celes, reclaiming Maizel\u2019s remains is important, but could you proceed the preparations on the funeral for me? I\u2026 have an urge to see ten thousand humans in pain.\u300f</p><br/><p>Bathed in her mother\u2019s blood, Celes tapered her mouth. She wanted to complain to Agrissa, but she was a foe Celes couldn\u2019t go against too strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, got it. I\u2019ll do it, jeez. Well, reclaiming a portion of father\u2019s corpse comes first. I\u2019d like the three of us to get together for a party soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eA party, eh? I never get tired of you.\u300f</p><br/><p>Celes preciously held her mother\u2019s head as she activated a Skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother\u2026 now come back to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mother\u2019s head floated through the air, her own body and blood nearby recycling itself and reverting. No, it couldn\u2019t be called a reversion. She wasn\u2019t alive any longer.</p><br/><p>But Clair regained her former form.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles, why are you so dirty? Oh, there\u2019s no helping you. Let\u2019s go to the baths together and get you all cleaned up.\u201d</p><br/><p>There stood her mother, the same as in her life. Celes smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mother. But with this, we can see father at once. I\u2019m so relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire smiled as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s a relief, Celes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Agrissa let her voice out from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt sure feels nice to do a good thing. I\u2019ve a longing for some cries of death and agony, Celes. And\u2026 Lyle, was it? For him to climb up from there, as I thought, he\u2019s got something to him.\u300f</p><br/><p>Celes pretended she didn\u2019t hear Agrissa\u2019s voice\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cYour feelings won\u2019t change?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the underground dungeons of Rhuvenns castle, I faced Beil. An individual I once admired as a knight, but now he had thinned down a bit.</p><br/><p>In his cell, he kneeled towards me with proper posture.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This body of mine can no longer serve you. I cannot forget anything and pretend not to know as I work under my liege. The Randbergh House pledges its devotion for life. I\u2019m sure Baldoir will serve you well.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems his resolve wouldn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>He spoke of everything pertaining to Bahnseim\u2019s internal affairs, and left loads of info with me. But when I proposed he change his name and serve me, he refused.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaldoir does do good work. I have considerable good will for the Randbergh House, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary! And with your current position, if you don\u2019t hand judgement to those responsible, you\u2019ll sow seeds of discord. I cannot trouble you any further. By all means!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was he so hurried to rush to his grave?</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t he live a little easier?</p><br/><p>The Third let out a voice from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Good grief, the Randbergh House is way too earnest. He should live his life just a little bit easier.\u300f</p><br/><p>He sounded a little sadder than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I have no grudge against you as an individual. That\u2019s simply how great a threat Celes was. And that one is my sister. A person of the Walt House. I think you\u2019ve only been troubled by our affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beil spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words are wasted on me. I am already resolved. Whether it be torture, or an incredibly brutal execution\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re different, but in the end are we the same? I always held such a question in my mind. I held it, but even so, I thought to challenge Celes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t save you. It\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not as if my life was the only one twisted by Celes. Starting with Beil before my eyes, many humans were driven mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly apologize, Lyle-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>Beil let his tears flow, letting sobs leak out.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Going out to the terrace of my room, I looked up at the sky.</p><br/><p>The morning air was cold, but right now, I wanted the pain it stung into my skin. Normally, I would\u2019ve shivered at this temperature, but I didn\u2019t feel anything right now.</p><br/><p>I felt some warmth behind me. A coat had been draped over my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s just you, Monica.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that without turning around, Monica sounded all high and mighty.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to look cool, immersed in your sentimental shit isn\u2019t fitting of a chicken like you. For covering you up before you exposed all your bad points to the world to the extent you\u2019d catch a cold, I don\u2019t mind if you offer me some more words of love, you know. I love you, is enough. I\u2019ll answer your call with all I have! This Monica will answer a Chicken dickwad\u2019s love at full force.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shut it. It\u2019s because you keep asking me to say I love you that I never get to say it. Why don\u2019t you learn the subtlety that comes with that field.\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Monica\u2019s twin tails swayed in the wind as she looked at me with a serious dace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dere. The chicken dickwad has finally shown his dere! I won! As I thought, this Monica will be the one to win in the end after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Spreading her arms out wide, Monica happily raced around the terrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe winner? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Monica acted bashful.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh surely you jest. I\u2019m talking about the chicks. Who you\u2019ll love the most, and who\u2019ll you\u2019ll entrust the first chick to. The Valkyries are having a factional dispute, quite an intense quarrel over who\u2019s going to look after them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third in the Jewel was surprised, and I covered my face with my left hand as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eEh~ the automatons have faction wars as well? What a pain.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can you guys stop calling my children chicks? Or rather, why did it come to that? If I touch anyone right now, everything will take a turn for the worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica jumped for joy as she spoke to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a road you can\u2019t go down by going around. Well, since I\u2019m your number one, your first night and looking after your chicks should obviously be left to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica\u2019s words left me staring blankly, but it truly was a road I couldn\u2019t avoid. However, I wanted to evade the carnage. I gripped the Jewel.</p><br/><p>It seems the Third inferred my feelings as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u300eSorry, I\u2019ve got no advice. I finally noticed it you know\u2026 your harem\u2019s already exceeded the maximum permissible dosage. You should see a doctor.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u2026 Isn\u2019t it considerably bad that he\u2019s only noticing that now? When I was sensing my limits long ago, it\u2019s no joke if he\u2019s just looking back now.</p><br/><p>The Third spoke as if reading me.</p><br/><p>\u300eI opened my eyes. As I thought, rather than a harem, I\u2019d rather love a single woman. Laying hands on numerous women is a brute\u2019s path.\u300f</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the one who pushed the harem onto me! I endured shouting that out as I calmed down my heart.</p><br/><p>Calm down, it isn\u2019t anything I can turn back. I can\u2019t change this flow anymore. Innis-san told me. It\u2019s impossible to avoid the carnage. The important thing is to make it as small as possible.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Dangit! No matter what I do, nothing but carnage awaits, what a life!</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>I had an awfully bad premonition. This sort of\u2026 feeling of loss I felt with my father\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t feel anything as I looked around. The Skills showed no reaction either. Monica looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Ah! If you\u2019re worried about your first night, then rest at ease. This Monica was initialized with various\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around. No, I feel this sort of sense of loss. Perhaps I\u2019m feeling a little sad with my father\u2019s death. I\u2019m going to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I returned to my room. Monica hung her head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Treating me as a joke? Not lusting after me as he keeps me by his side? This is the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing as she was as tenacious as ever, I looked out the terrace. Exactly what was that sensation?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

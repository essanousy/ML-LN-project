But looking at the names written over the paperwork, she began to shake her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re half right. I taught you our official stance, but in truth, it\u2019s more of an investigation into why the party in question vanished. \u201dCriminals and monsters, or perhaps a labyrinth. There are as many reasons out there as you can think of. It\u2019s to make sure the next ones who take their path don\u2019t fall prey to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Half right.</p><br/><p>The intention wasn\u2019t to save them, but to investigate why they had exceeded their duration.</p><br/><p>If you wanted to rephrase it, sending aid to the lost party was the second priority.</p><br/><p>Novem looked at the request formed, confirmed the party members\u2019 ages, and seemed to have noticed something.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid these people perhaps hire a guild advisor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san silently nodded, before letting out some toxic words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I told him. That he should just go retire already\u2026 after coming this far, there\u2019s no point if you die, is there.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the names on the form had a red line running through it.</p><br/><p>That was a sign that the one whose name had been carved on the guild card had received injuries leading to the ceasing of prolonged life activity.</p><br/><p>\u2026 So summarize, death.</p><br/><p>Perhaps out of luck, or because they were covered for\u2026 the five young adventurers seemed to be alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-hey\u2026 someone\u2019s going to go save them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria said that and looked around, but while the adventurers passed their eyes over the emergency request, they didn\u2019t seem to have the intentions of accepting it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The veteran adventurer that died was a strong one among those in Dalien. While it may be a town of newbies, he would\u2019ve been considered relatively strong even within the main force. A man like that has died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 To put it shortly, it would be difficult.</p><br/><p>Dalien had an abundance of odd jobs to be found, but the feudal lord himself took the initiative to subjugate dangerous monsters and clear labyrinths.</p><br/><p>While it may be convenient for those that had just joined the trade, there was some dissatisfaction to be had once they graduated from newbie status.</p><br/><p>Should I put it as their focus on local interest? Of course, there are some that continue to work in Dalien as adventurers, but a large majority of them leave, and head for a town or city more suited for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad. The guild was just requiting skilled adventurers for the labyrinth that manifested not too long ago. The feudal lords troops have yet to return either.\u201d</p><br/><p>A labyrinth emerged, and the guild solicited help in subjugating it.</p><br/><p>For that sake, a majority of battle-oriented parties had ventured off from the city.</p><br/><p>(Come to think of it, I did hear something like that.)</p><br/><p>Remembering the rumors I heard circulating around the guild, I looked around</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably not that there wasn\u2019t a single skilled adventurer here. But since they\u2019re trying to recruit people for the request in this fashion, I guess there wasn\u2019t any that could take on the job.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I heard that if you take on an emergency dispatch, the guild puts out quite a reward as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem seemed surprised that none of the other adventurers wanted to participate.</p><br/><p>There, Zelphy-san spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurvival over loot. There may be some out there who\u2019ll take the challenge to raise their names, but\u2026 this is troublesome. The place they headed was a dangerous one. If played poorly, whole parties can get annihilated.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like the entire landmass of Dalien was safe.</p><br/><p>For places outside of human inhabitation, there isn\u2019t much of an opportunity for soldiers to head forth and suppress dangerous elements.</p><br/><p>As we were looking at the request form close the counter, Hawkins-san called out to use.</p><br/><p>\u201cZelphy-san, can I have a little of your time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hawkins-san was letting off a sterner atmosphere than usual, as he called Zelphy-san over.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see the request?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, saw it. But from the contents, I get the feelin\u2019 it should have been posted up quite a while ago. Did somethin\u2019 happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was much too far past the point where it would be strange if they hadn\u2019t returned.</p><br/><p>Even so, today was the first time the urgent request hade made an appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It was a blunder on our side. I deeply apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn apology doesn\u2019t clear up the matter, though. It probably wasn\u2019t your slip up, boss, but we\u2019re all putting our lives on the line here. Has anyone set out the request\u2019s location yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Permission to head off to the designated point hadn\u2019t been granted yet.</p><br/><p>But since the news came late, there may have been adventurers who had set out for the dangerous area unaware.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps our luck was good this time. The parties that usually used the area as their hunting ground have headed off to the labyrinth. It\u2019s just that, that being the case, we can\u2019t find any adventurers willing to head over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fine if you went, boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Zelphy-san\u2019s joke, Hawkins-san didn\u2019t really return an answer.</p><br/><p>(Both of them are a little angry.)</p><br/><p>From what I can hear from their conversation, it might have been an acquaintance.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Hawkins-san. So what was the reason you called Zelphy-san over then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem sought confirmation, and Hawkins-san started apologizing to us.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an urgent dispatch from the guild. We might be temporarily borrowing Zelphy-san. For that time period, the guild will personally cover the expenses.\u201d</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s counting us in as a plausible fighting force.</p><br/><p>(But that may be natural.)</p><br/><p>As I thought that, I heard the Second\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eDo the measures taken by the guild in times like these change by the city? From what I remember, I get the feeling I heard of them forcefully sending out people against their wills.\u300f</p><br/><p>The one who answered was the Sixth.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe times change, and the guilds structure changes with it, but\u2026 Dalien\u2019s adventurers aren\u2019t of the best quality, so perhaps this sort of thing happens often.\u300f</p><br/><p>The ancestors sounded quite calm.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a need to panic, but I feel their reactions are a little too dry.</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san was making a reluctant face, but she sighed and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a request from boss, I can\u2019t really decline. It\u2019s just that I also want to know what sort of actions the guild is taking on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hawkins-san closed his eyes, and after a while of silence, he opened them and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe opinion of the higher-ups is\u2026 it was the mistake of a staff member, but they concluded that it was something that could happen to the best of us. In this instance, I doubt any punishment sil be handed down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Boss, in that case, none of us\u2019ll be satisfied. I hated that man for his mouth, but there are plenty of adventurers who\u2019ve been saved by him. While I loathed him, he\u2019s helped me out twice or thrice. Are you tellin\u2019 me to accept this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The talks seem to have started down a different direction.</p><br/><p>The three of us were being left behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cZelphy-san is dropping out of our party to fulfill an urgent request, it seems. In that case, what should we do today?\u201d</p><br/><p>I began to ponder today\u2019s plans.</p><br/><p>Odd jobs were fine, but since we had a party of three, I wanted to go out to fight monsters if possible.</p><br/><p>I wanted to experience Growth soon, and more importantly, I\u2019ll becoming needlessly specialized at physical labor at this rate.</p><br/><p>(I mean, they\u2019ve even started trying to lure me over.)</p><br/><p>The site foreman offered that I quite being an adventurer, and come work for him. I had to give a bitter smile, and refuse.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not that I hated it, but the earnings from it wouldn\u2019t support two, so it wasn\u2019t plausible.</p><br/><p>Aria looked at Zelphy as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if Zelphy will be fine. I mean, a skilled adventurer of Dalien perished, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem tried to calm her down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may not have been a monster or foe. It\u2019s not unthinkable that it was an accident. I also doubt that they\u2019ll be sending Zelphy-san out alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a party of six, one died, and the rest were missing in action.</p><br/><p>The possibility it was an accident was actually quite high.</p><br/><p>As I thought that, the First called out to me.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, you participate as well.\u300f</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this, all of a sudden? I thought, but the First probably had his reasons.</p><br/><p>The Third was of the same opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300ePerhaps that\u2019s for the best. And wait, in a request like this, the efficiency will generally rise if Lyle joins in.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth also agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf it\u2019s mine and the old man\u2019s (Fifth Generation) Skills, then finding them will be simple, and you\u2019ll be able to avoid danger.\u300f</p><br/><p>(I see. So if I use the ancestors\u2019 Skills, the efficiency will be on another level.)</p><br/><p>Especially the Fifth and Sixth. When used together, they were quite an amazing one.</p><br/><p>I can put up a map of my surroundings in my head, and enemy and ally\u2026 monster locations and traps can be known to me for a certain extent of distance.</p><br/><p>But if I said I wanted to participate, would Hawkins-san accept that?</p><br/><p>The Second was the same as me.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf Lyle said he wanted to join, would they permit it?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat are the merits of him going out for that? They\u2019re a group completely irrelevant to Lyle. Also, if he starts making himself stand out, then the reputation we worked so hard to lower in Dalien would be pointless.\u300f</p><br/><p>After hearing all their opinions, the First spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eMerits? Like hell I know. It\u2019s just that if he sees them off, and the adventurer called Zelphy dies, he\u2019ll have trouble sleeping at night.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh let out a fed up response.</p><br/><p>\u300eCould it be this is for that Aria\u2019s sake again? I doubt there\u2019s a need to go that far. If she died here, that means that was the extent of her ability.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth put a close on the disjointed opinions, and posed a question to me.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell then, like that, the opinions on the matter are divided\u2026 Lyle, what do you want to do?\u300f</p><br/><p>Having been asked for my opinion, I promptly put my hand on the Jewel-turned-necklace.</p><br/><p>There really isn\u2019t much merit in it, but if the First is saying this much about it, the perhaps it really is that dangerous.</p><br/><p>His sharpness of instinct is something I recognize.</p><br/><p>(Am I really able to resolve this problem?)</p><br/><p>If I used my Skills, the chances of success would certainly improve.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s just how useful the Skills I held were.</p><br/><p>But in order to participate, I have a need to persuade them. Hawkins-san and Zelphy-san. I\u2019ll have to let Novem and Aria stay behind as well.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a while, I came to my conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem, can you wait with Aria in Dalien for a while? I think I\u2019ll take up the urgent request with Zelphy-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, get a grip on yourself\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eNot happening. After you did so much posing, for you to be thrown in this situation\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou even left the convincing to Novem-chan\u2026 Lyle\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThere must have been a slightly better way out there. I mean, how could you draw back there?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eIt looks like there\u2019s a need for you to steadily build up your negotiation skills.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, with all things taken into account, I guess that\u2019s just how it goes.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou guys\u2026 that\u2019s all you have to say to my grandson!? Lyle was trying his hardest! He opposed Novem\u2019s participation up until the end of it, and in the end, he\u2019s still right here participating in the urgent request, isn\u2019t he!?\u300f</p><br/><p>(Stop it! Please don\u2019t stick up for me any more than that, Grandfather(Seventh Generation)!!)</p><br/><p>On top of the horse-drawn cart, I used both hands to cover my face. It had turned red all the way up to my ears, as I listened in on the Jewel\u2019s remarks, First Generation up.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve gradually become aware of it, but even if I cover my ears, I can still hear their voices quite clearly.</p><br/><p>From how the surroundings couldn\u2019t hear them, I had a hunch they weren\u2019t operating by sond, but\u2026 it\u2019s really a bother.</p><br/><p>The ancestors\u2019 voices I could hear even if I blocked up my ears\u2026</p><br/><p>The reason they were somplaining so much was because of the current situation.</p><br/><p>The guild sent out two carts, and they provided money for the necessary equipment. We were put in a temporary party, and sent off to investigate.</p><br/><p>Starting with Zelphy-san it was my same old party. Novem and Aria included.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Rondo-san\u2019s three were included in today\u2019s members.</p><br/><p>The guild also hired a single coachman.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-oy, are you alright, Lyle-kun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rondo-san called out to me in worry, and Novem, who was sitting next to me, also sounded worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, could it be a cold? You were fine until just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>In comparison to Novem\u2019s flustered state, Aria seemed extremely nervous. She tightly gripped the red gem over her chest.</p><br/><p>To her, Rachel-san started up a conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of those gems with Skills in it, right? A rare find in these times. How many do you have in it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cU-um, mine included, there are five.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Aria nervously gave an answer, Rachel-san\u2019s eyes began to sparkle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing! If you made is a Magic Item, it\u2019d fetch a price of one to two hundred gold coins. Since it\u2019s red, it\u2019s Vanguard Class, right? Is the compatibility alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Skill compatibility is an important factor.</p><br/><p>If you look at the Skills in my possession, the Fifth\u2019s and Sixth\u2019s become something quite amazing when used simultaneously.</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s not like the gem was set to make these sorts of combinations.</p><br/><p>For those that it was passed down through, it recorded their Skills without discrimination.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t really know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Aria seemed apologetic, Rachel-san hurriedly tried to console her.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t mind it! I\u2019ve heard that people with gems can\u2019t choose the Skills in them. Even so, if you have five on you, then you have quite a bit of fighting potential there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having been told that, Aria hung her head down even further.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t use them all yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the spear weilder, Rahu-san let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cRead the mood, Rachel. That aside, your party\u2019s the inverse of ours. It\u2019s quite a pain if you have more men on you. For me, Rondo and Rachel let off a pink aura, so I\u2019m left feeling lonely on the side\u2026 So, which one\u2019s your girlfriend, Lyle? I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s Novem-chan, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a time-consuming trip, so Rahu-san tried changing to a topic to ease our mental tension.</p><br/><p>(I-I\u2019m thankful. Rather than hearing the ancestors\u2019 persistant rants, a conversation like this is\u2026)</p><br/><p>As I thought that, Novem spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, both of us are Lyle-sama\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I hurried to cut her off, but I didn\u2019t make it in time. Aria\u2019s downcast face also turned red.</p><br/><p>Rachel\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? That\u2019s a joke, right, Aria-chan?\u201d</p><br/><p>There, Aria\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHe returned my heirloom for me, and when I was about to be disposed of, he went as far as to help me\u2026 and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay is clearly! You\u2019re inviting in plenty a misunderstanding, so you have to be clear at times like these!\u201d</p><br/><p>I hurriedly turned to Aria, but that liberated Novem\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is no misunderstanding. Aria-san received salvation from Lyle-sama, and right now, the three of us are living under the same roof.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem said that with a smile, and Rondo-san had a cramped smile as he confirmed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, so this a so-called harem-like occurrence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem, quite clearly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no so-called harem, it\u2019s a true harem. For now, we only have two, but from here on, I expect the numbers will expand considerably.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Novem let all that out with a bright smile, I opened and closed my mouth in silence.</p><br/><p>I doubt she was unable to read the mood, but there\u2019s no doubt she\u2019s being completely serious here.</p><br/><p>Rahu-san placed his hand on my shoulder.</p><br/><p>While his mouth was definitely curved into a smile, his eyes were smiling by no means.</p><br/><p>Similarily, the shoulder on my other side received Rondo-san\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you go a little into the details, Lyle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rondo-san was the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow enviable that sounds, Lyle-kun. I definitely want to hear just how you brought that to fruition, but before that, I think I need to have a little talk with you on how a man must treasure the woman he loves most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rahu-san coincided.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It wasn\u2019t a good idea for me to have started thinking of how to kill time until we arrived. I\u2019m definitely giving you an earful, so prepare yourself, Lyle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem continued to go on about her future harem expansion plans with a smile, and Aria and Rachel-san listened on with reddened faces\u2026</p><br/><p>It looks like there isn\u2019t a single savior on this cart.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Zelphy-san, who was driving the cart, heard the voices of young adventurers from behind her.</p><br/><p>She did try shouting at Lyle\u2019s group after they had suddenly stated their desires to take up the urgent request, but having been persuaded by Novem, she finally voiced her consent.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, she couldn\u2019t offer Aria any special treatment, so the girl was going to be participating as well.</p><br/><p>If it was about competence, her personal strength was high.</p><br/><p>And in this time, three other strong adventurers were also participating.</p><br/><p>They probably wouldn\u2019t fail through some reckless actions, but still, she was anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, what fun they\u2019re having\u2026 this isn\u2019t a picnic, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>She heard the voices of kids enjoying themselves from behind, and remembered how the lines she voiced were directed at herself, some long time ago.</p><br/><p>They were the words of the departed adventurer.</p><br/><p>\u300eZelphy-chan, this isn\u2019t a picnic, so how about we calm down a little?\u300f</p><br/><p>He taunted her when she was nervous, it was only later that she realized he was trying to ease her.</p><br/><p>He was wild, and his mouth wasn\u2019t the finest, but he was an adventurer good at looking after others.</p><br/><p>Whenever they met at the guild, they would throw around insults, and they had held drinking contests against one another at the bar as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to think of it, he lost his bet, so he owes me a drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zelphy looked up at the sky, as she mourned the loss of her colleague, who had served many years alongside her as an adventurer of Dalien.</p><br/><p>She really did mean it when she said he should have retired already.</p><br/><p>It was a dangerous job. If you could get out of it, it\u2019s best to do so as soon as you can.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, there\u2019s no point if you die. Weren\u2019t you the one that said that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if they were quick to fight whenever they met, Zelphy still recognized him as a comrade.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because she recognized him, that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely settle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zelphy\u2019s eyes were giving off a sharp light\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

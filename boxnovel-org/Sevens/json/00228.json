He boasted curling, short brown hair, and while he had an atmosphere from which one wouldn\u2019t feel much motivation, he had the caliber to be promoted to general at the very heart of Bahnseim.</p><br/><p>The contents plaguing him was the negotiations with their new neighbor Beim.</p><br/><p>Looking over the documents, Blois put his eyes through the report he had just received.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it may be temporary, a four-country alliance was formed. Did they think there wouldn\u2019t be many wars for a while, or are they turning their coffers to Bahnseim this time\u2026 those merchants of death sure are scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zayin, Lorphys, Galleria, and Rusworth\u2026 from Bahnseim\u2019s point of view, they were just small countries. But having gotten together, they had formed an alliance on a scale that couldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><br/><p>Here and there on all the pages, the name \u3010Lyle Walt\u3011 was written in.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I had heard there had been a driven-out brother, but he sure moves flashily. Even if he were irrelevant, I wonder how those merchants will use him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking over all that, Blois felt his head was going to ache. The reason he\u2019d gone through all the trouble of volunteering to be stationed at such a remote place, spending day after day chased after by work, was merely because he had noticed abnormalities at the capital, and had headed for the hills.</p><br/><p>But what would the queen-to-be say if she caught wind of this information?</p><br/><p>Neglect?</p><br/><p>Or assassination?</p><br/><p>His inability to predict it was because Blois knew of Celes\u2019 whimsy. For every time she would cut down the opposition without mercy, there were times where she\u2019d spend long months getting them to yield to her.</p><br/><p>At present with the king, queen, the crown prince, and the powerful Walt House behind her, there wasn\u2019t a soul who could go against her.</p><br/><p>If you opposed, your territory would be trampled down. With the example kindly demonstrated, the feudal lords kept their mouthes shut.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a detestable time. I\u2019m starting to see some relative truth in those tales of that beautiful courtesan all those years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Troubled as he was, Blois still had the obligation to report.</p><br/><p>Leaving the reports and such on his desk, he looked up at the ceiling, and rubbed the corners of his eye with a fingertip.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt Bahnseim\u2019s main territory\u2026 negotiations in Centralle, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beim was attempting to begin full-blown negotiations with Bahnseim\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In a room of the mansion in Beim, I covered a cover up past my head, wriggling on the bed in agony.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s not my fault\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason I was cowering to such an extent lay in how a four-country treaty was officially tied, formally forming an alliance. Without an official name, it was currently an agreement passed on a business relations level, but perhaps it would be fitting to say things were going favorably.</p><br/><p>Galleria and Rusworth asserted the formation of an engagement between me and their representatives.</p><br/><p>Zayin and Lorphys delivered documents requesting an explanation.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the main problem.</p><br/><p>It was also a problem, but it was already a fact, so it couldn\u2019t be undone. What I was focusing on most was the Jewel.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t near the bed, but on the desk. And yet, I could hear the voice up-close.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I\u2026 wanna see garters.\u300f</p><br/><p>LYLE spoke. Following his words, the post-Growth me had told everyone to prepare garters. What\u2019s more, I even put out the condition that they be ones that excited me.</p><br/><p>Just how much better would it have been if they had gotten angry at me there? If it ended with their anger at that point, that would have been the end of the matter.</p><br/><p>From the Jewel, I heard Milleia-san\u2019s bubbly voice. That woman was still holding a grudge at how she couldn\u2019t see my post-Growth state.</p><br/><p>I think she\u2019s definitely the type that gets vindictive if you make her mad.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, you must keep you promises. Look, let\u2019s go and see the undergarments everyone bought for you already. Don\u2019t be embarrassed. Some of them were custom ordered, oh I just can\u2019t wait~.\u300f</p><br/><p>They could\u2019ve just angrily refused, but instead, they all gathered together, discussed it a bit, returned to Beim, and put in requests to Monica and the other automatons.</p><br/><p>When shopping, they were told to put in as much zeal as if they were specially ordered\u2026 definitely to spite me.</p><br/><p>Because he never thought they would accept, there was no helping that LYLE\u2019s tensions were especially high.</p><br/><p>\u300eI also think stockings are nice.\u300f</p><br/><p>That opinion was approved by the Third.</p><br/><p>\u300ePreach it.\u300f</p><br/><p>I felt a presence before the door\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEeek!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 I cried out.</p><br/><p>Aria was on the other side of the door. Did she plan to get back for having to run all over the battlefield looking for me?</p><br/><p>\u300eNow get out there, Lyle. You want to see undergarments, don\u2019t you? They went to the trouble of preparing, so go look at it for them. On with it~.\u300f</p><br/><p>Knowing I would run away, Aria was going to gleefully drive me into a corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m not quite up for it today, so how about tomorrow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>From the Jewel, the ancestors talked smack about Aria\u2019s course of action. The Third even\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eShe just doesn\u2019t get it. It\u2019s the embarrassment that\u2019s key here. Aria-chan, you may be trying to get back at him, but you\u2019re not enticing in the slightest.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth sounded uninterested, however\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Rather than undergarments, can\u2019t we get some more clothing for May?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is why adventurers are\u2026 learn some shame, why don\u2019t you?\u300f</p><br/><p>And I was the one who wanted to run from the embarrassment. Knowing it would come to this, everyone had purposely prepared for this day.</p><br/><p>Aria was going on a strong offense, knowing I wouldn\u2019t hazard a glance down. It was vexing, but from my embarrassment, she was probably right.</p><br/><p>The usual Aria aside, when it came to the other members\u2026 imagining it turned my face red, and I began feeling annoyed at Aria, coming to rile me up on the other side of the door.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhen she went so far to prepare them? I see, so you don\u2019t wanna see. You spoke of your love for undergarments with such zeal, yet it was but a lie~.\u300f</p><br/><p>The one so zealous about them was the post-Growth me.</p><br/><p>He had ordered everyone to wear ones that would make him want to see. Getting embarrassed about it later, I became conscious of it, but using it as a reason, the female camp was incessantly attacking me.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why\u2026 it wasn\u2019t my fault. Yet LYLE\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eWoohoo! But after she\u2019s insisting so hard for you to look, I want to stare straight at her, scoff, and make her embarrassed instead! The flushed face of the usually violent Aria\u2026 I think it\u2019s a yes!\u300f</p><br/><p>He was all on board.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Fidel Tr\u0113s was happily reading a document in his estate.</p><br/><p>He put his eyes through the paper that had come to his office, and thinking of his incoming income, he felt as if he couldn\u2019t turn off his smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice. I was reluctant to invest in that gigolo, but the formation of a four-country alliance will give more meaning to the ports. Constructing them will take time and money, but when they\u2019re done, considering a usage fee\u2026 I\u2019ll be able to reclaim my investment within ten years. It was a good thing I ordered those new ship models. The Tr\u0113s House is sure to grow even larger in my generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Preparing ports on two countries with coasts, his monopolization of their use was already recognized.</p><br/><p>The authority of the Tr\u0113s House in Beim, the city of merchants, was sure to rise. And even if the formation of an alliance decreased the need for war, it made it so he could make it by on other enterprises.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a problem to the Tr\u0113s House at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damn gigolo, his ability is splendid, if nothing else. I don\u2019t want to admit it, but he\u2019s capable. If only he didn\u2019t trick Vera, we would\u2019ve made great partners\u2026 wait!? What was I just\u2026! Damn, this must also be his trap or something!\u201d</p><br/><p>If his daughter hadn\u2019t been involved, he would be perfect, of so Fidel said as he returned to his work\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Somewhere in Beim.</p><br/><p>There, the merchants and Guild executives gathered to talk.</p><br/><p>They were the ones profiting off of war, and had gathered together for the profits of all parties.</p><br/><p>In a narrow room, different from usual. The representative merchants and the guild top brass discussed.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Tr\u0113s House monopoly on the ports of two countries? It will get even more difficult for we, their opposition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA four-way alliance\u2026 it would be troublesome if war went down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just sell them to the adventurers. The adventurers will buy the weapons. But the problem is the mercenaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they\u2019ve no work, can\u2019t they just defeat monsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat level isn\u2019t enough to maintain a brigade. About that Labyrinth Subjugation we sent around to them, it didn\u2019t create much of a profit at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>While one party had benefited greatly from Lyle, there were others who had not. There were plenty of mercenary brigades who would be troubled by the lack of war nearby.</p><br/><p>Because they would need to change their base of operations. If they thought they couldn\u2019t earn money in Beim, they would immediately leave the city. But there was a reason Beim wanted to detain the brigades there.</p><br/><p>Beim was a special territory.</p><br/><p>A majority of its war potential came from its adventurers and mercenaries. In such a situation, having the mercenary numbers go down was a troubling story. And it wasn\u2019t just a tale of ten or twenty percent.</p><br/><p>If played poorly, only ten or twenty percent may remain. In that case, the number of people who would issue requests would go down, so it was an issue the Adventurer Guild South Branch couldn\u2019t let be.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lyle. I don\u2019t think leaving that brat to his own devices would be the best course of actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I hate to admit it, but he\u2019s a national hero. Putting hands on him will become an international problem. And before we could do anything, the talks of that defensive battle spread around. If something happens, they\u2019ll think we did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat brat! Spreading rumors, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s making us out as the villains! He\u2019s the one who said he\u2019s take on the job! And he only brought up talks for reinforcements once. He returned without even trying to negotiate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so the rumors have come that we abandoned him. But fact is fact. The rumors hold no lies.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gathered members thought of Lyle with detestable sentiment. There was no doubt in the fact Lyle was the hero who saved the city of Beim, so doing something to him would raise a problem.</p><br/><p>Within all that, a single Guild executive.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one in Bahnseim backed by her House, Celes Walt\u2026 future queen of the crown prince, but it seems she\u2019s considerably cruel. Civil wars continue to rage on within the country of Bahnseim. And she\u2019s the blood sister of that very Lyle Walt. Can we not make use of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, everyone showed light reactions only akin to a brief, \u2018you\u2019re not wrong\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHappens sometimes. Well, it\u2019s also the time for us to earn some money. Weapons fly off the shelves, and other things sell as well. But can we use him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mercenaries are already starting off towards Bahnseim. Is there no way to stop them? At this rate, there will be a chip in Beim\u2019s military might.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Guild executive. Head of the South Branch gave a slight smile as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because Lyle\u2019s here that Bahnseim is glaring at us. That\u2019s all you have to say. Let\u2019s leak some rumors. And present Lyle to Celes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other faces gathered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve thought over that before, but the boy was exiled. Does presenting him at this point truly hold any meaning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need only say he has the intentions to oppose. If you tell them the alliance in question was forged for that purpose, there\u2019s no way Bahnseim can leave him be.\u201d</p><br/><p>The alliance was a gathering of small countries. But brought together, they had as large a power as the addition of their parts. It was true he could move a force of twenty to thirty thousand troops, and if he pushed it, he could mobilize some times that amount.</p><br/><p>Those there looked around, and nodded amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He\u2019s a gotten a little too high on his horse, is how it is. But starting with the Tr\u0113s House, a large number of merchants have come to invest in him as well. If they put up opposition, forcing this talk passed will be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s possible. About the Tr\u0113s House, they\u2019ve been overdoing themselves a little as of late. Even increasing their lineup of new-model ships, on top of pouring quite some aid into the last war of Galleria and Rusworth. The Tr\u0113s House head is soft on his family, so he wouldn\u2019t think his daughter would move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, everyone\u2019s eyes turned to the South Branch head for further explanation.</p><br/><p>There was a possibility it would lead to large movements throughout Beim.</p><br/><p>The South Branch executive spoke delightedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Gina Tr\u0113s. She said if it would make her lover the head, she wouldn\u2019t mind jumping on board, and driving out the father. Good grief, merchant daughters sure are scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, upon hearing that name, knew only of rumors of a love across status. And thinking over whether she would really go that far, on the contrary, they started making delighted faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well. If that\u2019s the extent to which she uses her head, taking control of her should be a simple task.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConvenient daughters are quite an asset to us. We must give our blessings to her wedding. Shall we send some congratulatory gifts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also nice, but make the preparations. Given the occasion. Let\u2019s use this chance to drive the Tr\u0113s House\u2019s faction out of Beim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Talks proceeded forward.</p><br/><p>Lyle was on the verge of losing a large backer in Beim\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

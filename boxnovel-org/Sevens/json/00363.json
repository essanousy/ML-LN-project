In the town prepared within the castle\u2026 she walked through the inner palace, but it truly felt as if she walked through a small town.</p><br/><p>There were small children walking along the paths before her eyes.</p><br/><p>In their hands they held books and writing implements, and they were likely off to study in a different mansion. Rather, the only kids on the block who did that were Shannon\u2019s children.</p><br/><p>Generally, there was a time period where everyone got together and studied. But if that was insufficient, they\u2019d either call a tutor to the mansion, or go to the castle for some extra study time.</p><br/><p>That being the case, at Shannon\u2019s place, since she never got a proper education herself, their learning was completely left up to Miranda.</p><br/><p>Three young children.</p><br/><p>As they walked on, a Valkyrie stood to block their way, a toy in her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, you could at least play with us today. We are eternally devoting ourselves to the development and recreation of toys, and we can say you shall enjoy them with certainty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie recommended toys to the children who were going off to study, but all three kids shook their heads.</p><br/><p>The smallest one, a young girl with golden eyes, spoke to the Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnit Ninety Two, we\u2019re going off to study at auntie\u2019s mansion, so we can\u2019t play with you. We\u2019ll play once we get back, so until then, could you look after mom for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words coming from such a young child, Unit Ninety Two collapsed at the knees. The toy fell to the ground, but she didn\u2019t even try to retrieve it.</p><br/><p>Vera was impressed at how focused, those still-small children had grown to be.</p><br/><p>(Are they really Shannon\u2019s kids?)</p><br/><p>One of the kids retrieved the toy, and after handing it to Unit Ninety Two, the group took their leave.</p><br/><p>Ninety Two burst into tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cannot beeeee! This has to be a liiiiieeeee! I mean, there is no way the hybrid chicks of our master and that hopeless Shannon could be so upstanding! They should have taken some of the more useless parts, and not want to study, and just want to spend their days in ease\u2026 then we come in and say, \u2018oh there\u2019s no helping you cute little things,\u2019 and play with them\u2026 what happened to my dreeeeaaaammmm!!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the breaking down Unit Ninety Two, Vera stood fed-up.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Unit Eleven- who stood to her side- scoffed. In her hands, she held the baby that was Vera\u2019s child.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, how unsightly. When you boasted of having the largest faction of them all, this is where you end up? I\u2019ll show you how useless I can raise the chick at our place.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Valkyrie said that to the child with a smile on her face, Vera felt true fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that as a joke, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleven tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? I\u2019m quite serious. We plan to make out of them existences who would not be able to live on without us. Do not worry. With regular maintenance and overhauls, we brag that we can operate for several tens of thousands of years.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a sense, the Valkyries were scary existences.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I tell you you\u2019re wasting your abilities? Or should I rejoice you\u2019re pouring your efforts towards us\u2026 rather, what were the ancients thinking when they made you, I have to wonder.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of Ninety Two\u2019s eyes, Eleven lulled the baby as if to show off.</p><br/><p>Unit Ninety One looked on it with envy.</p><br/><p>They were quite a handful when they were babies. And the Valkyries couldn\u2019t get enough of that, apparently.</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufu, your big brother chick grew up to be a splendid human being, but as long as this Unit Eleven is here, I shall show you just how hopelessly we can raise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>For any servant who said that, a normal master would drive them out at once. But this was the inner palace, and the Valkyries were overly proficient as maids.</p><br/><p>Driving them out was impossible, and there was no intent to do so.</p><br/><p>For these Valkyries\u2026 as long as they were Lyle\u2019s children, the automatons would protect them unconditionally. They treated them as targets to guard, so no assassinations ever took place within the factional wars.</p><br/><p>More than that, if anyone tried, the information would leak, and the mother would be the one cornered.</p><br/><p>That they put a fixed brake on the factional disputes was something everyone was well aware of.</p><br/><p>They had no choice but to rely on them.</p><br/><p>As Vera took her walk, she looked up at the sky.</p><br/><p>Unit Eleven looked at her. Gently poking the baby\u2019s face, she seemed to be in bliss.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? What seems to be the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vera spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, you see. He said he wanted my second child to take over the Tr\u0113s House. He\u2019s using this hand and that to get me to approve of it, and it\u2019s getting to be a right up nuisance.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Fidel frequently commuted to the capital over the cuteness of his grandchildren, he was trying his best to get them out of the inner palace.</p><br/><p>Unit Eleven laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not happening. The Tr\u0113s House\u2019s heir was already decided to be the child of your sister Gina-san. If you wish, you could leave this matter to us. We cannot bear to have a chick snatched away, so we could find a truth or two he would not want found out and threaten him to obedience\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Eleven started into something scary, Vera cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course that\u2019s no good! Ah, goddess! I\u2019m going to bring this matter up with Lyle, so none of you lay a hand on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unit Eleven seemed quite disappointed.</p><br/><p>Night.</p><br/><p>Having dropped by Vera\u2019s mansion, Lyle looked at the baby in Monica\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Monica\u2019s right hand was properly cradling the baby. Her left was grasping Unit Eleven\u2019s head and pushing it down.</p><br/><p>\u201cG-give her back! That child is my chick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica made a triumphant smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unfortunate. As the Chicken Dickwad\u2019s exclusive maid, I can brag that the care of all his chicks fall under my jurisdiction. You degraded defects and mass produced lot can just stand down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Irk! Said Eleven as she played around with Monica. Lyle watched over it absentmindedly. A look at his figure, and it seemed that he was thinking over something.</p><br/><p>Vera looked at Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, were you listening? My father is genuinely trying to gain custody of his grandchildren, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle seemed taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Oh, I see. That\u2019s right. Those grandchildren are quite cute, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Lyle hang his head, Vera shrugged her shoulders. There, Monica burst into joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, it seems the chick is asleep. This Monica shall sing a lullaby. To sleep to my beautiful voice, you\u2019re quite the lucky one. The only one beside the Chicken Dickwad allowed to listen to it are his chicks.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Monica headed to the depths of the room, Unit Eleven gave chase.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou get out of here already!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the two automatons were gone, Vera placed a hand on Lyle\u2019s shoulder. Lyle raised his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this really isn\u2019t a good environment for them, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vera laughed a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Valkyries? But they\u2019re convenient. Since we have them, we never have to see blood in the faction wars. The children alone will always be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Lyle saw that as unnatural.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want them around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. They seem to be having their fun, and personally, I think they\u2019re a big help. But you see, their time is quite different from ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vera spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said they could remain operational a thousand, even ten thousand years. Isn\u2019t that secure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s eyes were serious, and Vera could understand that wasn\u2019t what he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they got serious, I\u2019m sure this empire could last thousands of years, maybe more. But you see, do you think that\u2019s the right thing? These days, it\u2019s been on my mind a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s sense of values was something he formed on his travels with advice from his ancestors. To Lyle, an ever eternal empire felt unnatural and unneeded.</p><br/><p>Vera agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may have a point. But if you take the children from the Valkyries now, won\u2019t they get angry? And the faction wars will intensify.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were only remaining peaceful because there was no worry of harm to their children, and if the possibility came out, there were many of the women there who would become demons.</p><br/><p>In truth, if Vera saw her own child might be in harm, she\u2019d do all in her power to protect them.</p><br/><p>Lyle held his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Why do they have to fight so much? I said it to Novem and Miranda as well. When I did, they laugh and say, \u2018the other one started it\u2019. Now that\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it? Ludmilla looks like the sort who\u2019d really do it. Why do they have to be so bloodthirsty? I\u2019d really like some slack here. I want to at least take it easy as I sleep. Learn a bit from Shannon. That one actually worries me because she never comes out of her mansion. Those two should learn to enjoy the great indoors.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lyle spilled his complaints, Vera embraced him and consoled him.</p><br/><p>Fourth Generation Head ( \uff20\u0434\uff20): \u201cEven when Vera-chan\u2019s so kind, her nickname in the comment section was, \u2018Wallet-san\u2019, popular as she was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica ( \u309c\u2200\u309c)o\u00b0: \u201cAnd I was popular too! \u2026 And!

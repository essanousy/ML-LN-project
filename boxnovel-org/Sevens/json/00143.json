Now it was night, and things had yet to die down.</p><br/><p>I listened to the hustle and bustle around as I proceeded preparations towards our withdrawal tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Eva was singing songs alongside her elven brethren.</p><br/><p>May seemed more busy than usual with the festival food stands.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Clara was exhausted from the enthusiasm, as she was lying flat in Porter.</p><br/><p>Aria was conversing with the new adventurers she\u2019d gotten to know over the trip.</p><br/><p>Miranda was bothered by something, and I saw her take Shannon along in the direction of Alette-san\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>Monica was maintaining her tools, and cleaning the area.</p><br/><p>On the wooden crate I was using in place of a desk, she placed a tray with light food on it. She left a drink, and some paper alongside it.</p><br/><p>I had to calculate our net gains, and of how we were going to use the peridot.</p><br/><p>Within the Labyrinth, we were able to find eight pieces of it in total.</p><br/><p>It was exceedingly noisy around, but I didn\u2019t find it particularly annoying.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is how a festival is supposed to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Up to now, I\u2019d only ever really seen them from afar. It was my first time joining in on one.</p><br/><p>From the Jewel, I heard the Third\u2019s curious voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eHuh? But wasn\u2019t there the harvest festival and all the other ones back at our place? They had them running in my generation, at least.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth explained in regards to that.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, after climbing all the way to counthood, I doubt they\u2019d be participating. At the big festivals, I\u2019d return to the mansion after I went out to give my greetings, after all.\u300f</p><br/><p>I never thought I\u2019d have a chance to go \u2018round a festival with friends. When I was small, my father would bring me along to give the opening address, and after seeing that nothing was wrong, we\u2019d return at once.</p><br/><p>The Fifth.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 If we were there, the folks that wanted to make noise would be too mindful.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth alone seemed to be having fun.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf you were a bit more of an adult, I\u2019d teach you more the joys of drink and slot, but\u2026 while we\u2019re at it, should I teach you of women for the times to come?\u300f</p><br/><p>Gahahaha, he laughed, as the Seventh drove the nail in.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhen someone who failed with female relations as much as yourself says it, you\u2019ve not the slightest fragment of persuasive power. Lyle, there are plenty who destroy themselves for a spot of fun. You should be careful yourself.\u300f</p><br/><p>Smiling a little, I reached out a hand to the food on the table.</p><br/><p>Potato cut slim, and fried in oil, alongside sausage fried in much the same way. The grease made my hands all sticky, but it tasted delicious.</p><br/><p>When I rose to wipe off my hands, Novem presented a wet towel to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go out and make merry?\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the towel, wiped off my hands, and placed it on the desk.</p><br/><p>As Novem looked at the memo paper in front of me, I explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to finish this up first. Best to save the fun for the end. I\u2019ve given everyone enough of the reward to play around. You should go out and enjoy yourself too, Novem.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the town was in festive spirits, there was no point if you didn\u2019t have any money.</p><br/><p>If it was just to play around, I had given out enough money. Of course, I informed them it was a deduction from the total reward they\u2019d receive.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo are you calculating the earnings? What will you do with the gemstones?\u201d</p><br/><p>Asked by Novem, I spoke in regards to the precious stones.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have them investigated once we return. Perhaps it would be best to keep them around as liquidable assets. We were able to bring in a lot this time regardless, so maybe I should leave them if they ever prove necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>If examination of the price proved it best we sold them, then that\u2019s what I\u2019d do.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t a bad idea to keep them close at hand, either.</p><br/><p>On the memo was how many times each member had challenged the Labyrinth, and on what evaluations I would use to distribute the reward.</p><br/><p>I had thought of splitting it up evenly, but in that case, Shannon- who barely did a thing- would profit more than anyone else.</p><br/><p>I would be handing Shannon\u2019s share to Miranda, but I doubt she would be satisfied with it either.</p><br/><p>So I was currently working towards a base reward evenly split, and a pay on top of that based on efforts.</p><br/><p>(It really is a pain.)</p><br/><p>While I thought that, the Fourth picked up on what was going through my mind.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, you have to be firm when it comes to money, or it will trouble you when it counts. Rewarding too much is no good, but too less is just as bad. There\u2019s your future goal to consider, but repaying work with money is an important thing among comrades.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth told me not to be too light about it. Perhaps the other ancestors held the same opinion, as there were no objections.</p><br/><p>Before I handed over the money, I\u2019d have to explain what the party\u2019s shared funds would be going towards.</p><br/><p>And tell them our total earnings, on top of how pay was decided.</p><br/><p>It was busy even after it was over.</p><br/><p>(No, this is just because I hadn\u2019t thought up the finer details yet. This time has been quite a good learning experience.)</p><br/><p>If you looked at us as a party, we were too few in numbers.</p><br/><p>But even mobilizing that amount was troublesome for the current me.</p><br/><p>Novem looked at me with an expression as if she wanted to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You really won\u2019t ask? About me and Oct\u014d? And Septem\u2026 about Celes-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>I extended a hand to my drink, opened my mouth to speak. I get the feeling the wind rose to rock the light of the lantern on the table.</p><br/><p>That didn\u2019t happen. But I couldn\u2019t help but feel it.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 To say my sincere feelings, I\u2019m absurdly curious. I really want to ask, but\u2026)</p><br/><p>I wanted to ask, but the party\u2019s dissatisfaction had just been resolved to an extent. I got the feeling that I didn\u2019t want to reheat it for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, she made a troubled expression, and hung her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it can come after you\u2019ve gotten the mind to speak. Right, I have only one thing to confirm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Novem.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem, for whose sake do you move?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, she pinched her skirt with the tips of her fingers, and lightly raised it to give a tidy curtsy.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 For Lyle-sama\u2019s sake. Those words hold no lies or fabrication.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then so be it. Quite a bit happened this time around, and I have secrets of my own. Right\u2026 I\u2019ll have to properly talk about that one as well. But for now, shall we enjoy the festive air a bit more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Drink and make merry\u2026 could I do the same? And of the matter\u2026. Of the problems that stemmed from my Growth highs, could I drink them away?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll never forget them, though.</p><br/><p>(And wait, with all that\u2019s going on, I\u2019m exhausted. I don\u2019t have any free time anymore.)</p><br/><p>I thought of the nearer future, as I turned my eyes to the paper.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Beim\u2019s Eastern Guild Branch.</p><br/><p>After a horse came with the notification, an emergency meeting was opened up in the guild.</p><br/><p>All the staff members they could gather were gathered, and with such a hole being made in their normal duties, the personnel looked quite worried.</p><br/><p>They had heard it was going favorably, but could a problem have surfaced?</p><br/><p>After everyone challenged the meeting with such an expression on their faces, the person in charge came in.</p><br/><p>Perhaps in a panic, the senior officer\u2019s usual seven-to-three parted hair was in a mess, as he announced the success of this time\u2019s Labyrinth Subjugation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, I must apologize for taking time from your busy schedules. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all anxious, so I\u2019ll put this out there. This time\u2019s Labyrinth Subjugation was a huge success. A low amount of casualties, alongside a comparatively large amount of treasures and stones for the Labyrinth\u2019s scale. The Guild should be nothing but happy for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The receptionists calmed down.</p><br/><p>Tanya, who recommended Lyle\u2019s party was the same.</p><br/><p>But the senior officer didn\u2019t look all too happy about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the same time, there was a report in regards to the treasure found in the innermost chamber. The one to acquire it was the party led by Alette Baillet. That in itself isn\u2019t an issue. However, the treasure discovered was a considerable amount of mithril.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mithril.</p><br/><p>Even among Rare Metals, it was a rare one. Normally, it would be discovered in Labyrinths twenty to thirty floors deep in scale.</p><br/><p>But such a thing had come out in one of only ten.</p><br/><p>Tanya corrected her glasses with her fingertips as she waited for the officer\u2019s explanation. The surroundings personnel began conversing with the others around, but the noise eventually died down.</p><br/><p>If it were a twenty floor Labyrinth, there was a chance of finding mithril. But just because there was a chance, it\u2019s not like you could suddenly find a mountain of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure many of you know of Alette Baillet\u2019s situation. Once she returns to her country, she goes back to being a knight. Naturally, she cannot go against the will of her country. If they say they have not the mind to sell it to us, then that\u2019s the end of the matter, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that what Alette\u2019s party had found was mithril was a large problem.</p><br/><p>Normally, it was something the guild and its affiliated merchants would give everything to buy, but if the other party didn\u2019t feel like selling, they\u2019d have to back off.</p><br/><p>The rights to it lay with the adventurers who beat the final boss of the Labyrinth. Going out of your way to obtain it would mean raising problems with capable adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The knight brigade she is a member of. Meaning her country has its own circumstances. It\u2019s going to become a bit of a problem. With that in mind\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The country her knight brigade was in service to was classified as a small one by those around it.</p><br/><p>But a small country as it was, its knights trained and built up experience as adventurers, making for a proficient fighting force that centered on actual combat.</p><br/><p>With all the surrounding countries being bigger than their own, they compensated for their small numbers with quality.</p><br/><p>Now about that country\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, it would all be well and good if any adventurer besides Alette Baillet had found it.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words from the senior officers, the guild staff dispersed.</p><br/><p>Tanya recalled the circumstances of Alette\u2019s country.</p><br/><p>(Of all things, for it to be the country seeking out mithril for the Saint Succession.)</p><br/><p>Alette\u2019s country \u3010Lorphys\u3011, was stationed in the neighborhood of the theocracy of dubious diplomatic relations, \u3010Zayin\u3011.</p><br/><p>And at present, the symbol of Zayin- the Holy Maiden- was changing generations, and they were scraping up mithril from wherever they could find it.</p><br/><p>While its diplomatic relations were quite sensitive, Zayim was also a country that had gone through repeated wars with the country of Lorphys.</p><br/><p>Things had calmed down at present, but it was the sort of place where the slightest problem couldn\u2019t help but ignite the gunpowder storehouse.</p><br/><p>And the mithril that Alette had found. What\u2019s more, in considerable quantities\u2026</p><br/><p>(I do hope it ends diplomatically.)</p><br/><p>While she followed the dispersing receptionists to her own station, Tanya had such a thing on her mind.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>The center room had turned back from an arena to a conference room, and the ancestors sat around the round table.</p><br/><p>This time\u2019s Labyrinth Subjugation had held good prospects for those ancestors as well.</p><br/><p>The Fourth stood, took out a blackboard, and began scribbling the main points over it.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then, I\u2019m sure everyone has their own take on the matter, but let\u2019s get it all together for now. Lyle is still quite depressed, so I doubt he\u2019ll be moving much for a while, after all.\u300f</p><br/><p>Unfortunately enough, a Lyle that wasn\u2019t mr. lyle suffered a large chip to his assertiveness.</p><br/><p>And this time\u2019s matter made it more than clear there was something up with Novem.</p><br/><p>The Third.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Novem-chan is a good kid. At least that part is no mistake.\u300f</p><br/><p>He obstinately refused to condemn Novem.</p><br/><p>The fourth didn\u2019t want to chastise her either. The daughter of the house who\u2019d practically raised him, and Lyle\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e.</p><br/><p>And all she had done for Lyle up to now.</p><br/><p>\u300eBut we can\u2019t just go about closing our eyes to all the issues. I\u2019ll have you all say your frank opinions on the matter here.\u300f</p><br/><p>Within that dubious air, the Fifth with his elbow stuck into the table opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300eOct\u014d, was it? Denoting number eight, and a something that dwells in the depths of the Labyrinths. No matter how you think about it, we won\u2019t go off to meet here, but there\u2019s one existence I know of that overlaps with hers.\u300f</p><br/><p>The one to endorse his opinion was the Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eExactly my thoughts. Rather than the eight part, her residence in the Labyrinth\u2019s depths. Meaning if you\u2019ll remember who creates the Labyrinth, there\u2019s one individual that comes to mind. The birther of Labyrinths, the evil god who became the enemy of mankind.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth looked up at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>\u300eSeven goddesses, and two evil gods. Nine if you count them up. If it\u2019s as the automatons say, then it\u2019s starting in zero, and ending in nine. Ten gods, is it?\u300f</p><br/><p>At the start, there was nothing in the world.</p><br/><p>There, the goddesses descended. They created the sky, the earth, the forests, living beings, humans, and finally, they granted wisdom, or so was left in myth.</p><br/><p>The reason any god worshipped henceforth were women must be because this world was created by goddesses.</p><br/><p>The Third put his hand on his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u300eOnce again, that\u2019s quite a large-scale story we\u2019re bringing up here. Well, of course\u2026 none of that is relevant to us.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Enlarging the problem won\u2019t bring about a resolution. And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re part of a tale to alter the direction of the world.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Our goal is to take down Celes, who\u2019s hijacked the country of Bahnseim. What\u2019s more, in a way that will bring about a good result to Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt will be troublesome if goddesses start coming out here. They\u2019re gods because they lay their hands off, stand back, and watch after all. I\u2019d appreciate they continued along that trend.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eBut making entreaties to them is quite important. It changes how well you can command soldiers. Ah, we were talking about the Novem problem, weren\u2019t we?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth removed his glasses, and began rubbing them against a cloth.</p><br/><p>\u300eHonestly, when an evil god is telling us to trust Novem, that puts her on the dark side regardless of how you slice it. Yep, quite a cute evil god we\u2019ve got there. Personally, Celes seems more cut out to the job.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth proceeded conversations, a little fed-up.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt really gets troublesome when you start calling them gods. When he gets the time, let\u2019s just get Lyle to look into it. Though I doubt anyone will be left here when the time comes.\u300f</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s face looked unusually lonely.</p><br/><p>The Sixth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 We\u2019ve gotten a little too involved, have we?\u300f</p><br/><p>The usually-aloof Third put his hand to his chin.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Originally, it would have been the end once we taught him how to use the Skills. But personally, I\u2019d like to think that there was some meaning to our meeting.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t be so faint-hearted. If there\u2019s no meaning to it, you need only make one yourself. Say that we\u2019re here to make Lyle win.\u300f</p><br/><p>Seeing the Seventh say that brimming with confidence, the Third gave a, \u2018right you are,\u2019 and smiled.</p><br/><p>And he stretched his arms.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then, we\u2019ve gathered some considerable funds. If we\u2019re putting that towards collecting information, he\u2019ll have to get an army strong enough to fight on a national level. Otherwise, it won\u2019t even be a battle.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe Walt House knights and soldiers are on the other side. How hard it shall be. We\u2019ve turned our own tempered elites against us, after all.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the Fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s\u2026 you know\u2026 you can say you know their weaknesses, or something.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth.</p><br/><p>\u300eSimply having high quality troops doesn\u2019t win wars. The side that carries out the preparations to win, and carries them out to the end are the victors. He\u2019ll have to do at least that much.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eAt the very least, it\u2019d be a different story if he could use the soldiers of some country out there. If he\u2019s going to be building everything up from scratch, then Lyle lacks the time.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll throw this on top, but you can\u2019t just solve everything with money, either. It\u2019s best you don\u2019t borrow soldiers from an idiot who\u2019d lend them out for money in the first place. I really don\u2019t want to borrow anything from a guy like that. No~ how troublesome. After saying we\u2019d make him win so boldly, we don\u2019t have the slightest of ideas.\u300f</p><br/><p>Seeing the Third raise his hands in submission, the Sixth spoke tiredly.</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, don\u2019t just go giving up all of a sudden. It will take some time, but there\u2019s still the option of building up a mercenary brigade, and taking over a country.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth.</p><br/><p>\u300eNah, not happening.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eMercenaries have no credibility.\u300f</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Fourth corrected his glasses, and spoke in jest.</p><br/><p>\u300eAt this point, how about we just get Lyle to seduce some princess out there already? If we can only prove his lineage, his face is on the better side, so take a girl or two, and the country while he\u2019s at it? Or something like that~.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth had said that as a joke, only to find himself taken aback.</p><br/><p>All the faces surrounding the round table had serious expressions as they thought to themselves.</p><br/><p>The Sixth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Huh? Isn\u2019t that just what we need? And wait, I get the feeling if he was up to it, then using Skills and stuff will make it more than possible.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo, no, what does that say of him as a person? I get the feeling he could do it, but that\u2019s just as if Celes had become a guy. No different. He\u2019d be doing the same thing.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s an emergency, so if it comes down to it, just wife them all\u2026 no, I do think it\u2019s quite impossible.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Dammit, if it were mr. lyle, then perhaps that Faunbeax princess would\u2019ve been seduced already. We\u2019ve let a huge chance slip by.\u300f</p><br/><p>After saying that much, everyone exchanged some glances.</p><br/><p>They had done the thought, but they didn\u2019t think such a thing possible.</p><br/><p>The Seventh spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eI-its not happening. Though I\u2019m sure he could do it.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Sixth as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. If he did such a thing, his head would be on the cutting block of all the countries he nabbed up.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth wiped off his cold sweat.</p><br/><p>\u300eI-I know, right? It\u2019s impossible, right?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth corrected the positioning of his glasses, wiped off his own sweat, and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eOf course. Lyle fundamentally can\u2019t do anything like that. And he\u2019s usually a late bloomer. Well, let\u2019s start by collecting information, and see what we can do about it from there.\u300f</p><br/><p>In that strange atmosphere, everyone forced themselves to laugh, while the Third spoke in an earnest expression.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 If he were mr. lyle, it would definitely be happening.\u300f</p><br/><p>He spoke with conviction\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I aimed for the skull.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t sent airborne, but after falling back, the Large Man\u2019s body was unsteady, having taken a hit to the head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a convenient Skill you have there. I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, the man took a stance with his axe.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if it was because of the effects of another Skill, or because the man himself was strong against physical impacts. It could be either, or neither.</p><br/><p>He continued to swing his axe left and right while attacking me. For some reason, he was raising a loud voice.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t a sound to threaten an enemy.</p><br/><p>He probably understood that in that moment, my body\u2019s movements had changed. At the same time, the strike he had been saving to finish me was ineffective.</p><br/><p>Discovering that his trump card didn\u2019t work, perhaps he became impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou monsteeerr!!\u201d</p><br/><p>While thinking of how cruel it was to call anyone you couldn\u2019t beat a monster, I used my two sabres to parry again and drove in a kick.</p><br/><p>One of them felt like it was going to break.</p><br/><p>(The effect of a Skill\u2026 amazing.)</p><br/><p>This time, the kick was sent to his stomach.</p><br/><p>Having fallen to his knees, the man looked at me with a face as if he had seen something unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I have enhanced speed and power. Against a delicate girly guy like you, why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He definitely had the Skill effects and greater power.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m pretty sure my speed was the higher of us, though.</p><br/><p>Of course, as long as you could control Mana, you could raise your power as high as you wanted. Since I also had that sort of training hammered into me, I couldn\u2019t really call him all too powerful.</p><br/><p>He was just temporarily raising his strength.</p><br/><p>There was an overwhelming deficiency in technique.</p><br/><p>I identified the surrounding presences with Skills and felt the rest of the bandits had already been apprehended.</p><br/><p>All that was left was the large man before my eyes.</p><br/><p>As I approached, he discarded his axe and raised his hands. And to me, he petitioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-wait! I-I\u2019ve taken a liking to you! If it\u2019s with you, I think I\u2019ll be able to dream big! So, so how about taking me as your subordinate? If so, I don\u2019t care if you use my men as soldiers, or anything you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did a complete flip of personality, and he started to display a weak manner.</p><br/><p>Looking at the axe, it wasn\u2019t within range of his hands.</p><br/><p>But the First spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, this is a crafty one. Those guys that have a cowardly face often\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Perhaps because he noticed me shifting my eyes for a moment, he took out a concealed knife and entered a position to use a Skill.</p><br/><p>The Gem in his left hand let off a faint light.</p><br/><p>He directed a vulgar smile in my direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDumbass!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Have a weapon or two hidden somewhere on their person.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth Generation let out a fed up voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eCouldn\u2019t you have said that a little earlier?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAre you a fool? This is more than enough time for Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>By the time I heard the First\u2019s voice, I was already launching a flying kick on the enemy.</p><br/><p>Because I hit his jaw with a rising kick, the Skill ended in a misfire.</p><br/><p>When I looked around, I was surrounded by adventurers.</p><br/><p>Based on their looks of relief, it looks like they thought I would fall victim to a surprise attack.</p><br/><p>I thought I was being careful, but perhaps I wasn\u2019t paying enough attention.</p><br/><p>(I was saved by the First\u2019s Skill. And wait, this Limit Burst\u2026 It\u2019s also an extraordinary one.)</p><br/><p>There was a limit to consecutive usage, and they all had their quirks, but they were all useful.</p><br/><p>I released the Skill and looked at the unconscious man.</p><br/><p>\u300eI guess that\u2019s about it. Lyle, before you turn him in, his left hand\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>On the Fifth\u2019s words, I released the Skill, went up to the unconscious man, and forcefully ripped away the cloth wrapped around his left hand before retrieving the gem.</p><br/><p>The red gem gave off a faint glitter.</p><br/><p>(Somehow, I get the feeling this one is much more useful.)</p><br/><p>Looking at it, I turned my head to the blue Jewel shimmering on my chest.</p><br/><p>The Jewel that constantly complained and even put restrictions on my Skill use.</p><br/><p>In contrast, this gem didn\u2019t select its wielder, taught one how to use Skills, and let them use them freely.</p><br/><p>If you asked which one I wanted to choose, I have a strong inclination to choose the latter.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Oy, that kinda hurts.\u300f</p><br/><p>Maybe the First sensed what I wanted to say with his feral instincts, as he let out a soft voice.</p><br/><p>Novem and Lockwarde-san rushed to my side.</p><br/><p>The bandit troupe\u2019s boss was surrounded and tied up by the adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama\u2026 splendid performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem\u2019s eyes were a little teary, but she still directed a smile at me.</p><br/><p>Lockwarde-san looked over me hastily.</p><br/><p>She probably wanted to say something, looking at the red gem in my possession, but because she didn\u2019t really do anything herself, she couldn\u2019t work herself up to say it.</p><br/><p>(An awkward person she is.)</p><br/><p>As I thought that, I heard voices from the adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, this is quite serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood\u2019s coming out of his body. Is this the recoil of his Skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no problem long as he\u2019s alive. Oy, we\u2019re carrying him off.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I turned around, I saw blood spurting out of the bandit leader\u2019s body. On the large man, the adventurers applied medicine to heal the wounds.</p><br/><p>(Well, yeah, it would be troublesome if he dies.)</p><br/><p>Overuse of Skills. It looks like his body couldn\u2019t keep up with them</p><br/><p>(I understand when I look at that, but there\u2019s reasons the ancestors put usage restrictions on my Skills.)</p><br/><p>Looking at the bleeding man, I reminded myself to be careful with that in times to come.</p><br/><p>And this time, Lockwarde-san called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cU-um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With an exceedingly troubled expression, She shifted her eyes to and from the gem and my face.</p><br/><p>Looking at that, Novem spoke to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, it\u2019s time for you to fulfill your objective.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I handed over the gem in my hand. I wanted to toss it over, but when I thought about it, it was a precious family heirloom.</p><br/><p>It was better to give it by hand.</p><br/><p>Lockwarde-san received it by clenching both of her hands around mine and the gem. She looked at my face and burst into tears.</p><br/><p>With her bright red face, she looked like she wanted to offer her thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, well, I didn\u2019t really do much, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As her words weren\u2019t coming out, Novem spoke to her kindly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease accept it. That was Lyle-sama\u2019s desire. That\u2019s right, right Lyle-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>She laughed to herself as she sought confirmation from me, and I scratched my finger in embarrassment and averted my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, how should I put this\u2026 I\u2019ve accomplished my objective. So there\u2019s no problem. More importantly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-thank\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lockwarde-san tried to squeeze out some thanks, but she couldn\u2019t get it all out.</p><br/><p>An adventurer approached us, so I turned towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for getting in the way. But this\u2019s also our job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, thank you. We\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve been helped here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, he took off his hood.</p><br/><p>He was a male with sharp eyes and an atmosphere that indicated he wasn\u2019t one to be trifled with.</p><br/><p>Rather than bounty hunting, this was an adventurer with a friendly attitude towards their feudal lord.</p><br/><p>Based on ability and character, he was a dependable adventurer.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t one of Dalien.</p><br/><p>I asked Zelphy-san and received their cooperation.</p><br/><p>For that sake, I confirmed with the Guild whether or not that would become a problem. Hawkins-san made a difficult face before saying I couldn\u2019t do it openly.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s like giving tacit consent, right? More importantly, I was worried about whether or not they would really assist us.</p><br/><p>(If Zelphy-san truly wanted to save Lockwarde-san, I thought she would assertively ask for their cooperation, and it looks like I was right.)</p><br/><p>The adventurer made a relieved face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo we\u2019ve also been helped plenty. With this, these guys will be judged on our land. The feudal lord will likely rejoice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, they were from the lands where these bandits ran rampant. Skilled adventurers from those parts took place in our bandit subjugation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the treasure they\u2019ve piled up, we\u2019d like to look for the items we\u2019re searching for as well. I\u2019m sorry for a rush, but I\u2019d like you to bear witness of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight, right, at times like this, you have to move quickly. It\u2019s because the job\u2019s not over yet. Let\u2019s explain the situation to the adventurers from Dalien as well. There may be some who go after the treasure of their own desire otherwise.\u300f</p><br/><p>I heard the cheerful Third Generation\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Since I was supposed to bear witness, I asked the adventurer for an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u300eFor us to be relying on adventurers..\u300f</p><br/><p>It looks like the Seventh didn\u2019t rely on them in his time.</p><br/><p>The Third answered him in a tired tone.</p><br/><p>\u300eEven I had a few adventurers I was on good terms with\u2026 Well, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t get where you\u2019re coming from. They have their best and their worst.\u300f</p><br/><p>We weren\u2019t lacking in skilled men for our job.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat axe as well. It belonged to one of the Feudal Lord\u2019s mistress\u2019s sons. His relatives were looking for it. I know you have the right to it, so they should give out quite a price for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the battle axe the large man used.</p><br/><p>It definitely was a splendid piece.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t need it, so I left the pricing to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. We\u2019ll go with whatever sum they present. Now then, shall we go confirm the rest of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re so understanding. But are you sure? I\u2019m pretty sure they said it was something like a precious inherited heirloom, you know? It would be possible to inflate the price quite a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I turned my eyes to Lockwarde-san, startling her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not in that sort of mood (I\u2019ve already fulfilled what I set out to do. I don\u2019t have a reason exhibit any more desire).\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then this way. We haven\u2019t touched it yet, so it\u2019s still in the mines. Also, I\u2019ll tell the client about the axe memento. They\u2019ll definitely be overjoyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so\u2026 well, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s best if I didn\u2019t say anything unnecessary, right? That\u2019s what I thought, so I just left it all to the other side\u2019s good will.</p><br/><p>I headed into the mines with the adventurer.</p><br/><p>Novem followed me. Lockwarde-san saw me off.</p><br/><p>More than that, she was probably frozen, unsure of what she wanted to say.</p><br/><p>Perhaps she was spacing out from relief.</p><br/><p>\u300eSplendid. Truly splendid. To Alice-san\u2019s descendants, I returned Alice-san\u2019s gem\u2026 god dammit, the tears are coming out.\u300f</p><br/><p>It sounds like the First Generation was crying.</p><br/><p>Looking at that, the Second fired off a line.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhy is it that the sight of a middle aged man crying is so unsightly? Does it look like that precisely because you\u2019re our founder?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou bastard! What do you think your saying when I\u2019m over here feeling it!? Let\u2019s take this outside!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAnd as I was saying, we\u2019re stuck here! Why don\u2019t you learn a bit, you barbarian!?\u300f</p><br/><p>It was their usual exchange, but\u2026</p><br/><p>(Oy, stop! I\u2019m tired after finishing a battle\u2026 ah, the dizziness is\u2026)</p><br/><p>As I swayed a little, Novem immediately supported my body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, oy, you alright? Well, you did work that hard. You could rest a little\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no\u2026 I can hang on for a little longer (You both need to learn!!)\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t shut up until the end.</p><br/><p>This was my usual pattern, but I\u2019m starting to hate it.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>On top of a rattling cart\u2026</p><br/><p>Locked up in iron bars, the bandits were thrust onto three narrow-looking carts.</p><br/><p>Leaving the territory of Dalien, they had no idea they were being sent off to the lands where they were notorious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit all, we didn\u2019t even do anything yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight! We haven\u2019t done anything in this territory!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get released soon enough! And steal it all back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bandits let out some selfish lines, but the adventurers around them were all smiles.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem they were laughing at the lines the bandits were selfishly throwing out. It looked like they knew what was in store for them.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, the large man felt a sense of discomfort.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, these guys are Dalien adventurers, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He rubbed his aching chin as he asked one of his subordinates. It was one of the ones who gathered information in Dalien as an adventurer.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever seen him before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being told that, the large man surveyed his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Just where are we headed? For us to have been taken beyond Dalien\u2019s borders, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, one of the adventurers approached the iron bars.</p><br/><p>Atop a horse, he observed the bandits as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did we ever say we were from Dalien? You guys are going to receive proper judgement in the territories you made a mess of.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bandit troupe\u2019s faces suddenly went pale.</p><br/><p>A country where the feudal lords held great power. That was the Bahnseim Kingdom.</p><br/><p>While they all shared a connection, each land was shaped by its lord\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>For that reason, criminals that crossed borders were often regretfully left at large.</p><br/><p>Though if they went too far, some famous bounty hunter or another would come for their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what do you mean!? We were in Dalien! There\u2019s no reason you should be taking us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at their confused leader, his surrounding subordinates became even more panicked.</p><br/><p>The adventurers\u2019 smiles widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe merely happened to capture you all after you coincidentally crossed over to our territory. Because Dalien\u2019s adventurers coincidentally drove you all the way here, we who were coincidentally in the area took the initiative, and arrested you. Good grief, this is troubling. Those guys in Dalien\u2026 we\u2019ve gotten ourselves in quite a debt.\u201d</p><br/><p>The adventurers had each taken on varied requests.</p><br/><p>I want you to return my valuables stolen by the bandit troupe.</p><br/><p>I want you to take down my family\u2019s enemy.</p><br/><p>They had taken on those various requests all at once, and rushed over to Dalien to participate in the Bandit Subjugation mission.</p><br/><p>The one who got in contact with those adventurers linked to the feudal lord was Zelphy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t screw with me! Why did it turn out like this!? Because we\u2019re the villains here? Then there should be greater bastards out there for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just as the large man said.</p><br/><p>The bandits\u2019 sins amounted to nothing but light crimes in the eyes of a true villain.</p><br/><p>Of course, compared to true villains, that was.</p><br/><p>Their sins were still quite heavy.</p><br/><p>They assaulted villages and even burned them to the ground. They launched attacks on the mansions of the lords governing the villages. To the women, they\u2026</p><br/><p>They had piled up various crimes.</p><br/><p>But the lord of the land where they did such things was unable to lay hands on them once they fled. At this rate, the lord\u2019s honor was being crushed.</p><br/><p>The dissatisfaction of the fief would pile up, at their unreliable lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if I know. Your luck was bad this time. Also, even if you tell me that after you\u2019ve rampaged for so long\u2026 We even have adventurers here from the villages you guys raided, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the large man looked around.</p><br/><p>Among the smiling faces, there were a few who weren\u2019t smiling at all.</p><br/><p>They were holding up the weapons in their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-we\u2019re going to be judged, right? If you kill us here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah? The hell you talking about? \u2026 Even if there\u2019s one or two less, if you\u2019re tried, it\u2019ll be group execution, right? We just have to keep a reasonable number of you alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 All of the bandits\u2019 faces went pale.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Having returned to Dalien, we released the personnel we had gathered up and returned the tools and carts we borrowed to the appropriate merchants.</p><br/><p>Of the treasure the bandits hoarded up, we returned a majority of them, so if you discount the payments, we have what would amount to around sixty gold coins.</p><br/><p>(Normally, we\u2019d be deep in the red. Even if we subjugated them, if you think of all the various problems that\u2019ll crop up, the lord here\u2019s head must be hurting.)</p><br/><p>In case the requested assistance fell through, we did hire some skilled adventurers from Dalien as well, just in case.</p><br/><p>For that, we expended quite a bit of money.</p><br/><p>It was a pain to search for the place the bandits liquidated their stolen assets, so I left most of that to the adventurers.</p><br/><p>Everything ended, and all that was left was to report to the guild.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, we can finally put a period on the matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stretched my body.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood job, Lyle-sama. Even so, just what was your real goal there?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem asked, I was troubled over just what it was I should respond.</p><br/><p>Should I divulge the truth of my ancestors\u2019 wills in the Jewel, or should I stay silent?</p><br/><p>(No, I should take the opportunity to tell her. She already saw me use those Skills in that previous battle, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m lacking in persuasive evidence\u2026)</p><br/><p>Then, pulling a horse, Zelphy-san appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice work, you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-thank you for your work, Zelphy-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem said that, I also gave a light reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s go hit the baths before dropping by the guild. Boss Hawkins is definitely waitin\u2019 in worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Zelphy-san said that, an image of a worried-looking Hawkins-san floated up in my head.</p><br/><p>We hadn\u2019t known each other for long, but he truly was a good person.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s. Also, Zelphy-san, you have some business with us as well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>On my words, Zelphy-san widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>She scratched her hair and averted her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Well, well, I thought you were a weak brat, but you turned out to be quite the amazin\u2019 kid, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Letting out a sigh, she spoke to us.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter droppin\u2019 by the Guild, let\u2019s go to the lord\u2019s manor together. There are some things you guys\u2019re better off knowin\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, she corrected her position on the horse and left.</p><br/><p>Novem directed a smile at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you notice it? That Zelphy-san was an adventurer affiliated with Dalien\u2019s feudal lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her words, I raised both of my hands to signal my surrender.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably later than you, Novem. Also, I didn\u2019t notice it by my own ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eRight, I\u2019m the one who noticed it. No, I mean, she was skilled, and she was able to gather information in the blink of an eye. It was only around the, \u2018hey, isn\u2019t this girl just a bit suspicious?\u2019 level, but when that Aria girl came out, it became gradually clearer\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s enough. This conversation isn\u2019t getting anywhere.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third started to brag, but the Fourth stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just thought she was a little suspicious. From the time that Hawkins-san recommended her as our advisor. Of course, I think we would have gotten Zelphy-san even if we paid a smaller fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou suspected her from the beginning!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, they recommended us an advisor when we clearly had some peculiar circumstances surrounding us. Also, while the system existed, they didn\u2019t openly recommend it to the other applicants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at her laughing to herself, I began to question why she paid such a high fee in that case.</p><br/><p>Having sensed that, Novem offered an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I thought that advisers would advise their best when money was involved.

It was just like the sounds of nature. Good lyrics, good music, good voice, good zither skills. It was worth coming to the prime minister\u2019s residence today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stood on the rock and jumped down. Her dress fluttered like a fairy and she landed in front of Duanmu Yi Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Duanmu, it\u2019s your turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t know why, but Duanmu Yi Yi felt that it seemed as though Murong Qi Qi had changed into another person. The light exuding from her (MQQ) body was so dazzling, making her (DYY) heart feel timid.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t lose! Duanmu Yi Yi gritted her teeth and sat in front of the guqin. Her hands stroked the strings, but her fingers slightly trembled.</p><br/><p>Originally, she was thinking that after Murong Qi Qi played a song, she would know the ability of the other party and pick a good song to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat. She didn\u2019t expect Murong Qi Qi to be so good. If she lost to this rubbish Murong Qi Qi, how would she be able face people in the future!</p><br/><p>\u2018Beng\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>A shrill sound sounded. Duanmu Yi Yi paled. Her lips also began to quiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked coldly at Duanmu Yi Yi. Playing the zither and actually made a broken sound. Anyone who heard this would say that she had lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis lake, are you going to jump on your own or do I need to give you a ride?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t seem like she is joking. Duanmu Yi Yi knew she had lost, but she never expected that Murong Qi Qi would mention the bet at this moment. Making her the dignified Duanmu family\u2019s miss jump in the lake, she might as well kill her!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi looked pitifully at Duanmu Hong Chen. If today she really jumped into the lake, how could she continue to live in the future?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAy\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his little sister\u2019s pitiful expression, Duanmu Hong Chen sighed. Although today Duanmu Yi Yi was really too much, but making him see his little sister jump into the lake, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, can you give me some face and spare her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Hong Chen thought that because of his identity, no matter what Murong Qi Qi would concede. He didn\u2019t expect that the other party would say such a sentence: \u201cAre we very familiar with each other? Who do you think you are? If you can\u2019t afford to gamble, then don\u2019t play!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Hong Chen\u2019s face stiffened. He being the young master of Duanmu family, when had his face ever been swept like this?</p><br/><p>A handsome face, because of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words, had twisted like rope.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I need to do for third miss to let my little sister go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi acted as though she had heard the biggest joke in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the one who had lost today was me, would she have let me go? Would young master Duanmu plead for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s questioning made Duanmu Hong Chen speechless. Indeed, if it had been Murong Qi Qi who had lost, according to Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s unwillingness-to-forgive personality, she would absolutely not let it go. She would have certainly made Murong Qi Qi jump into the lake. This matter, after all, was Duanmu Yi Yi who had provoked it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, it was just a joke, is it necessary to be so serious?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The silent Murong Jun, at this time, put out a posture of big brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter should be forgotten like this! You won. All the things are yours. What more do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun\u2019s words made Murong Qi Qi sneer: \u201cBig brother, you finally open your mouth to speak. It was just, you saying this, I would think your surname is Duanmu! When other people suffer, there would immediately be a big brother who protected her. I get bullied, I don\u2019t see you, big brother,come out, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s sarcasm made Murong Jun\u2019s expression immediately turn black.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, don\u2019t go overboard! Who do you think you are?! You are just a rub\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish the word \u2018rubbish\u2019. A green light flashed. A wisp of black hair near Murong Jun\u2019s ear fell down. Looking again, the thing that cut Murong Jun\u2019s hair was actually a thin leaf. The one who shot it was Li Yun Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Yun Qing, what are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun jumped up. Fortunately, that leaf only cut his hair. If it was a little closer, his carotid artery would have been severed.</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing didn\u2019t bother with Murong Jun. Instead, he smiled at Murong Qi Qi. Because of this smile, his handsome features became more charming.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, didn\u2019t little cousin sister complain that there is no big brother who protects you? From today onwards, I\u2019ll protect you, good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing offering a helping hand was outside of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expectation. The thing this big cousin brother liked the most was watching a play. Now he is offering her a helping hand and also making a promise, which made Murong Qi Qi become really surprised. He would protect her? Did this mean that in the future, if anyone wants to bully her, they need to see if Li Yun Qing would agree or not?</p><br/><p>Having such a big tree to rely on, Murong Qi Qi is naturally willing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig cousin brother, you must honor your promise. If in the future someone wants to bully me, I\u2019ll directly put out your name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, if I do anything, or if something happened and I did wrong, there\u2019s big cousin brother to carry the blame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when Murong Qi Qi moved her body behind Duanmu Yi Yi. She raised a foot and kicked her into the lake.</p><br/><p>\u2018Putong\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi fell in and made a huge spray of water. All of this happened so fast, making people unable to stop it. When everyone came out from the daze, Duanmu Yi Yi had already thumped straight into the water. While struggling, she shouted \u2018help\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Hong Chen glared once angrily at Murong Qi Qi. He jumped into the water and pulled Duanmu Yi Yi out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, ah\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing totally didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi had said so much so she could use such a \u2018kick\u2019 in the end. But since he put her under him, naturally he would protect her. Presumably, Murong Qi Qi wanted to do that, that\u2019s why she had deliberately acted like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle demon girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing\u2019s voice had a taste of indulgence in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Murong Qi Qi, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being Duanmu family\u2019s eldest miss, when had Duanmu Yi Yi received such humiliation like today? She didn\u2019t care about the fact that her whole body was dripping water, she pulled out the sword from Duanmu Hong Chen\u2019s waist and directly stabbed it in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bitch! Go die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Wu Ji shouted, but he was too far away from Murong Qi Qi and had no time to approach her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi grabbed the dagger of Shangguan Wu Ji in \u2018panic\u2019. She closed her eyes, screamed and didn\u2019t dare to look at Duanmu Yi Yi.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s sword was about to pierce Murong Qi Qi\u2019s chest, she (MQQ) moved slightly. The sword brushed past her body. The wrist of the hand of Duanmu Yi Yi holding the sword happened to touch the dagger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuang\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s wrist felt pain, the sword fell on the ground. On her wrist, there\u2019s immediately a bright red color.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill me! Big cousin brother, save me, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi screamed and jumped behind Li Yun Qing.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi held her wrist and screamed: \u201cMy hand\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Hong Chen immediately went forward to inspect and found that Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s tendons on her right wrist had been neatly cut by the dagger. Red blood was flowing out. If this right wrist was not treated immediately, he was afraid that in the future, it could no longer be lifted, let alone play the zither or hold a sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, endure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Hong Chen glared fiercely once again at Murong Qi Qi. He picked up Duanmu Yi Yi and flew out of the pavilion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird big sister, you\u2019re in trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>At one side, Murong Qing Lian smirked while taking joy in the misfortune of others.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually cut miss Duanmu\u2019s tendons. This time, you are in big trouble! Duanmu family will certainly not let you off easily!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He immediately retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang stared at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes. Her eyes were so beautiful and weren\u2019t lesser than the stars in the sky. At first, it was this pair of eyes that had made his spirit and soul upside down, made him fall so deep that he couldn\u2019t free himself.</p><br/><p>Spirit and soul upside down: infatuated and head over heels in love</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, what you said earlier today, does that still count?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s hands supported his body. His long hair fell on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body. His eyes were full of eager desire, waiting for Murong Qi Qi\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I say during the day?\u201d How could Murong Qi Qi remember that Feng Cang meant that sentence?</p><br/><p>Seeing that until this point, this little woman was still confused, Feng Cang laughed bitterly. Suddenly, he leaned over and kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips. His tongue pried her lips open and wantonly plundered her fragrance as if by doing this sacred ceremony, he would let her mouth be infected with his taste.</p><br/><p>Different from the usual gentleness, today\u2019s Feng Cang was like a hungry wolf; crazy and passionate.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring the day, you said to make me surrender\u2026Qing Qing, I want to ask you, is this true\u2026,\u201d After a long time, Feng Cang let go of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips. His nose and her nose touched. With such a short distance, his eyes quietly looked at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang saying it so straightforwardly, how could Murong Qi Qi not understand? Immediately, blood rushed to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s brain. Her face got fever and her eyes showed shyness.</p><br/><p>It turned out that he wanted\u2026Just the thought of what was about to happen, made Murong Qi Qi immediately feel like a lost deer, wandering in a vast forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, can you? I want you! Wanting so much\u2026I nearly went crazy! Qing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang didn\u2019t hide his desire for Murong Qi Qi. For a long time, he felt stuffed to death.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang wanted to be a gentleman, but he had overestimated his own strength! The woman he loved was at his side and in his arms. Seeing her every day and hugging her every night. Smelling the green apple fragrance from her body and feeling the warmth from her body; if he was indifferent, then he wasn\u2019t a normal man.</p><br/><p>It was very silent inside the room. Murong Qi Qi could clearly hear her own heartbeat, \u201cBoom, boom, boom\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Feng Cang so closely, Murong Qi Qi could see the thick eyelashes on his deep eyes. One by one, they slightly trembled. Obviously, Feng Cang was restraining himself. She could feel it.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t speak. Feng Cang supported his body with his hand. The two maintained this position and looked at each other, face to face. Although his expression didn\u2019t change, but inside Feng Cang\u2019s heart, he was afraid. Afraid that Murong Qi Qi would refuse! Although he couldn\u2019t be a gentleman, but he also couldn\u2019t become a villain and use the forceful way.</p><br/><p>He wanted her to give herself willingly and not forced.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, if you\u2019re not ready, I can wait. Truly!\u201d Although, the tremble in Feng Cang\u2019s voice was very slight, but Murong Qi Qi still heard it. This man, ah\u2026Murong Qi Qi was touched and put her hands around Feng Cang\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, I am willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>This \u2018I\u2019m willing\u2019 let Feng Cang hold his breath for a long time. He didn\u2019t dare to believe his ears. He could only look blankly at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi hooked Feng Cang\u2019s neck and let him get closer to her. She took the initiative to kiss Feng Cang\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019m willing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang just said the two words \u2018Qing Qing\u2019, but it was drowned in their hot kiss.</p><br/><p>At this point, Feng Cang\u2019s hands were also slightly trembling. He somewhat couldn\u2019t believe his ears! She\u2019s willing! She loves him! She\u2019s about to become his!</p><br/><p>An unprecedented sense of happiness and satisfaction filled Feng Cang\u2019s heart. His Qing Qing was finally about to become his.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026\u201d After the kiss, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cheeks were bright and red like blood, \u201cThat\u2026I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said this, Murong Qi Qi lowered her eyes from shyness and didn\u2019t dare to look at Feng Cang. Although she was a time-travelled girl, but in the previous life, she hadn\u2019t experienced the things of love. She only knew the theory that was worse than useless in practice. To Murong Qi Qi, the things about love were completely a blank paper. (Author\u2019s note: A pure female character, ah-)</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s shy expression made Feng Cang chuckle. She didn\u2019t know, he also didn\u2019t know. The first time he dated was with Murong Qi Qi. His first love was also Murong Qi Qi. He also only heard about the thing she didn\u2019t know about. How could he not be clean? (Author\u2019s note: A pure male character, ah-)</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I also don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>After those words fell, Feng Cang also got a big red face. It was reasonable to say, at his age, he should have had a large number of wives and concubines and a bunch of children.</p><br/><p>If people knew that the famous Nan Lin wang1 Feng Cang was a pure little virgin, anyone would laugh till their teeth fell off.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang had finally summoned the courage to confess; Murong Qi Qi was surprised for a moment and looked startled at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, allowing you to be pure and faultless and I can\u2019t remain chaste?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing \u2018disbelief\u2019 flash in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes, Feng Cang bit Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips, \u201cI have been waiting for you, my little bride!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, how to begin\u2026\u201d After she asked this, Murong Qi Qi almost bit her tongue. She\u2019s so stupid! She actually asked such a question!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s shyness, Feng Cang kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s earlobe, \u201cQing Qing, why don\u2019t we start from listening to words of love?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, do you know, before I met you, I thought this world was black and white, that I would never meet someone I would love and would never get loved; until I met you. My treasure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s lips gently touched Murong Qi Qi\u2019s earlobe. The breath he exhaled lingered around Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ear. Heat like a warm flow wrapped around Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ear, stimulating her hearing and her sense of touch.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou made my life turn colorful. You let me understand that the world\u2019s sweetest thing is nothing more than love. You let me fall deeply in love with your everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along Murong Qi Qi\u2019s beautiful jaw, Feng Cang\u2019s kiss arrived at her small chin. That kind of numb feeling followed Feng Cang\u2019s lips. Feng Cang\u2019s hands also grabbed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s waist to press her closer to him.</p><br/><p>Afraid that Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t bear his weight, Feng Cang\u2019s right arm supported him near Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hair. His fingers slowly combed her black hair. His pair of affectionate eyes didn\u2019t leave Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s voice was like magic and let Murong Qi Qi gradually put down her shyness. She was also no longer so nervous and only infatuatedly entangled with his affectionate eyes. Her eyes only had him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how anxious I was when Shangguan Wu Ji took you away!\u201d Feng Cang untied the bow on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s dress. Layer by layer, like a cocoon. Careful and meticulous in fear that he would brutally ruin this tranquillity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was not sure if you would go with me, but I still insisted on chasing you. To tell you the truth, I feel that, that time was one of my most wise and handsome moments. Qing Qing, do you know how worried I felt while I was chasing you?! I was so afraid that you will go with him! I said to myself, if by chance you went with Shangguan Wu Ji, I should show my generosity. I needed to support you and take care of the aftermath for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When saying this, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s dress had been taken off, revealing a snow-white arm. Under the light, that blood-red gecko cinnabar mark laid silently on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s arm as if it was waiting for someone to take it off.</p><br/><p>When he saw that white small clothes which was different from normal undergarments on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body, Feng Cang froze. A moment of short-circuit appeared in his brain. He also forgot the words he wanted to say and only stared at those small white clothes.</p><br/><p>These clothes were different from undergarments. One, because the color was white. Two, because the shape was very strange. Two thin straps wrapped around the shoulders. Following, was two palm-sized fabrics.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, what is this?\u201d Feng Cang pulled at the thin straps. Murong Qi Qi blushed. \u201cThis is the underwear I designed, it\u2019s called a bra.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIll omen? Why don\u2019t you call it lucky omen?\u201d</p><br/><p>(xi\u014dngzh\u00e0o): ill omen, (xi\u014dngzh\u00e0o): bra; are homophones.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026,\u201d Seeing Feng Cang like that, Murong Qi Qi laughed. She had forgotten that this could be the first bra in this world. Originally, she wanted to produce it and put it in Jue Se Fang. However, now she didn\u2019t have the time. So, she\u2019d made it first for her own use. She didn\u2019t expect that the first time she wore it, Feng Cang would meet it.</p><br/><p>Looking at the trembling white shoulders and peacefully moving clouds because of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s laughter, Feng Cang\u2019s breathing became heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang suddenly stopped and didn\u2019t dare to move. She was just like that, lying perfectly in the red bedding. The red silk made her skin appear snow white. Her exquisite figure plus her beautiful and moving eyes, made Feng Cang feel somewhat suffocated. He didn\u2019t know what the right thing to do was.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang being so \u2018cautious\u2019 made Murong Qi Qi laugh. She got up and her hand hooked on Feng Cang\u2019s belt.</p><br/><p>No matter what dynasty, men\u2019s clothing was simple to take off. For example, Feng Cang\u2019s clothes. They were exquisite and gorgeous, but it was just a matter of a few ropes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, your figure is as charming as your personality.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the man with the broad shoulders and thin waist in front of her, in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes appeared infatuation. Such abs, such arc; putting him in the modern world, matched with this devilishly beautiful face, he would definitely be the world\u2019s top model.</p><br/><p>Learning from what Feng Cang just did, Murong Qi Qi climbed on Feng Cang\u2019s shoulder, sat on him and faced him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang was a bit nervous. Just now, he was very courageous. But now, meeting the last line of defense and after seeing that strange little clothes, Feng Cang was somewhat timid. He didn\u2019t know how to start.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi tied her long hair together. She turned. Her back faced Feng Cang. Only now did he see the mystery behind this. He reached out and gently unlocked the final seal. A complete beauty appeared like this in front of Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi was full of spring and let her long hair fall on her left side. She turned slightly and looked at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>That long hair covered her beauty like a piece of black clothes. It was hard to tell if it was real or a sham. It revealed a bit, making Feng Cang\u2019s throat become swollen. Every time he took a breath, his throat would swell badly, making it very hard to breathe.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I beautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi got off the bed. Barefooted, she stepped on the ground. On her whole body, from the top to bottom, was only clothes made from black hair. The graceful posture was faintly discerning through the black hair. All were highlighting the beauty of this woman.</p><br/><p>Beautiful, really beautiful. So beautiful that Feng Cang was afraid to go touch her. He was afraid that he, such a commoner, would taint the beauty of this woman in front of him.</p><br/><p>Originally, it should be a warm passion, but now, a layer of pure light surrounded it. Feng Cang didn\u2019t have any fanciful (dirty) thoughts. He only quietly looked at Murong Qi Qi as if she was a fairy who had descended from heaven and that he could only worship her.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a long time, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t get Feng Cang\u2019s initiative. Ay.. She sighed in her heart. Why was Feng Cang, an ancient man, was more of a gentleman than a modern man?! It seemed that only she could be the seductive one!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi went forward and pushed Feng Cang down at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang was started, but he felt a burst of warmth from his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cSmooch, smooch\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi was like a baby. While sucking, she kept repeating, \u201cDrink milk, ah. Drink milk, ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, Feng Cang blushed. Murong Qi Qi laid on his chest. That appearance was no difference from a baby\u2019s. Plus her behavior and the words from her mouth were like that of a baby.</p><br/><p>In just a moment, Feng Cang sensed his full vitality. Her kisses seemed to swept away all his worries, all the things that bound him, all his cautiousness and all his nervousness away. What was only left was the deep love for her.</p><br/><p>That kind of numb feeling spread over his whole body, making every one of his capillary blood vessels begin to have increased blood flow. Plus, it made him restless, making him immediately turn from a pure gentleman to a big bad wolf.</p><br/><p>After trying for a while, the other side was still \u2018indifferent\u2019, making Murong Qi Qi feel frustrated. She buried her head against Feng Cang\u2019s ear. Murong Qi Qi began to sob, \u201cCang, do you really love me? Why can\u2019t I feel your love?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tears of the beauty made Feng Cang startle. He quickly put his arms around her, but he didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t have any clothes on her. When his hands touched that smooth as satin skin, his fingers couldn\u2019t help but tremble slightly. He liked it and enjoyed this touch.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I love you! My heart only has you! Now, it\u2019s like this. In the future, it will also be like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why don\u2019t you want me?!\u201d Murong Qi Qi raised her head. Inside the beautiful phoenix eyes, two big tears were wandering. They wanted to jump out, but had been forced back by Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s tears completely swept Feng Cang\u2019s worries away.</p><br/><p>What was he doing?! He actually made her in tears!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Qing Qing. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Feng Cang kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face and felt heartache over her sadness, \u201cQing Qing, you\u2019re too beautiful, making me not dare\u2026to pick you! Qing Qing, forgive me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when Feng Cang kissed Murong Qi Qi, the two were pasted together. A fullness filled Feng Cang\u2019s heart out of midair. This kind of never before satisfaction made him unable to extricate himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang growled and threw himself on Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing! I love you!\u201d Feng Cang stared at Murong Qi Qi and said it in a serious tone. Go to hell, being a gentleman; go to hell, those dog fart feelings. He only wants her and only loves her! He\u2019s not a god. He\u2019s only a mortal. Even if she was an immortal who fell in the mortal realm; to be loved by him, he would also use every way to let her stay!</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang spat out his love declaration and kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>This kiss was complete and filled with enthusiastic satisfaction, making the two\u2019s hearts become closer and adjust intimately to each other\u2019s. Her tears opened the door in his heart. His kiss untied her seal.</p><br/><p>With the long kiss, his hand moved along her beautiful curves and explored the mystery of a woman for the first time. Although in the beginning, his hands were trembling a bit, but with their kiss becoming more intense, his modesty soon disappeared. He just wanted to grasp her and let her become his.</p><br/><p>Because of practicing martial arts, on Feng Cang\u2019s finger was a thin layer of callus. This callus wasn\u2019t rough, but it triggered Murong Qi Qi\u2019s sensitivity. Now, it became her turn to be slightly trembling; like the flowers in the wind, from the weakness revealing strength.</p><br/><p>The two kissed like the earth was shattering. Feng Cang\u2019s kiss moved along her chin and came to her white and elegant as a swan neck. He gently sucked her throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026,\u201d A wobble appeared in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice. Aside from being feminine, it had a husky taste. It was unlike her usual crispiness, but it tempted people even more.</p><br/><p>Feeling the fiery power, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s whole body burned. Her eyes, because of their (FC &amp; MQQ) closeness, were plated with a layer of haziness, full of colors.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Feng raised his head and looked deeply at Murong Qi Qi. \u201cQing Qing, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also love you!\u201d Murong Qi Qi somewhat wanted to cry, but it was wanting to cry from happiness. What adopted father had said, follow your heart, presumably it was this!</p><br/><p>All the love piled up. Feng Cang\u2019s breathing became both heavy and rapid. His voice suddenly became a bit urgent, \u201cQing Qing, can I? Really, can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that it had come to this moment, Murong Qi Qi nodded while blushing. Her hands were on Feng Cang\u2019s shoulders. She heard that the first time would hurt. She had never experienced it and didn\u2019t know how it would be.</p><br/><p>Seeing the tension in Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang wasn\u2019t impulsive. He once again kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s pink lips, \u201cI love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Probably in this world, there wouldn\u2019t be a man gentler than the man in front of her! Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart filled with something called moved. She took the initiative to meet Feng Cang\u2019s kiss. Her initiative was the greatest encouragement for Feng Cang. With the gratefulness towards god, with the love for the woman in his arms, Feng Cang kissed Murong Qi Qi deeply. Their fingers entangled together\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurt!\u201d Murong Qi Qi whispered a cry and bit her lips. In her eyes appeared two crystal clear tears. Sure enough, this wasn\u2019t an easy task\u2026</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s slightly crying voice, Feng Cang stopped. Enduring made a thin layer of sweat appear on his nose and forehead. One by one, they were big as sesame seeds and gradually became the size of beans.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, if you\u2019re hurting, then bite me!\u201d Feng Cang reached out his arms and put it in front of Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi was hurting, he also didn\u2019t feel good. That kind of feeling he\u2019d never had before wrapped around him, letting him indulge in it and feel pain and happiness at the same time.</p><br/><p>Really a kind of torture and happiness which was difficult to describe.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was like this, Murong Qi Qi had no trace of politeness. She bit Feng Cang\u2019s shoulder. The taste of blood in her mouth seemed to shift her pain. When the discomfort of her body gradually eased, Murong Qi Qi loosened, \u201cCang, love me!\u201d</p><br/><p>This \u2018love me\u2019 was like it had opened a gate and made the whole world sunny.</p><br/><p>It was also like a military command. After Feng Cang got this command, he threw all the people and things to the clouds\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

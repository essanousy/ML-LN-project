He has always been cold, but now he smiled at her. This means, after he watched her dance he likes it! Murong Xin Lian was very happy. She walked back and sat down next to Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cCe wangfei1, this is what empress niangniang2 awards you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A palace maid appeared in front of Murong Xin Lian. She put down a plate of dessert and a glass of wine down. Then she quietly retreated.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian raised her head and saw Longze Jing Tian nod at her. She knows that she just performed well. She has been praised by the emperor. This is the same as a reasurement for him. Thinking till here, Murong Xin Lian was even happier. The heat made her feel somewhat thirsty. She tasted the dessert and drank the wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor uncle, at Nan Feng, Xin er3 heard that Xi Qi\u2019s imperial noble consort and Jing wang\u2019s4 cefei are sisters. The two are number one beauties and also have numerous talents. Just now, seeing cefei\u2019s dance, Xin er couldn\u2019t help but admire from the bottom of my heart. It seems that all misses from Murong fu5 are exceptional. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know if Murong third miss is also as remarkable as her two sisters\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin\u2019s words once again let everyone\u2019s gaze fell on Murong Qi Qi. Knowing the other party\u2019s intention, Murong Qi Qi lowered her head. She played with her fingers as if there was no one around. As if she didn\u2019t hear Ming Yue Xin and she doesn\u2019t seem to know that Ming Yue Xin is waiting for her to make a fool out of herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expression, he was somewhat embarrassed and helpless.</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi is Murong fu\u2019s third miss, but now she has another identity. That\u2019s Bei Zhou\u2019s Nan Lin wang\u2019s wangfei6. And just now everyone saw the attitude of Feng Cang towards Murong Qi Qi. Even if Longze Yu was muddle headed, he won\u2019t go look for trouble at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>At this time, the one who is the happiest can\u2019t be anyone but Longze Yu Er. Having Ming Yue Xin\u2019s at the head, she can just put a bit of firewood. She doesn\u2019t believe that it won\u2019t burn up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, since it\u2019s a palace banquet, everyone is just planning to have fun. Princess Xin and Xin Lian imperial sister in law has danced a dance. Why don\u2019t you also let us open our eyes, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Having Longze Yu Er join, this matter became even more interesting. Murong Qi Qi finally raised her head and revealed an innocent smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan it be that the edict emperor made known to the world is false? Why does everyone not know that bengong7 is already princess Zhao Yang? Or is it that a princess title bestowed by emperor less noble than a princess from the imperial family, so that why I need to be like a geisha and please the crowd to let them have fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Ming Yue Xin and Murong Xin Lian\u2019s expression change dramatically. What does she mean? Is it making fun of their action for being like a geisha? The two glared fiercely at Murong Qi Qi, but the other party still has a \u2018I\u2019m innocent\u2019 expression which immediately made anger rose in the two\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, a rubbish is just a rubbish. Even if you let her wear a princess hat, she will still be a rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking advantage that Feng Cang isn\u2019t here, Longze Yu Er continued to attack Murong Qi Qi with vicious words.</p><br/><p>Anyway, the other party has information that can be used against her (MQQ) in her (LYE) hand. If it becomes a big deal, she can just make those scandals of Murong Qi Qi public. Presumably Feng Cang won\u2019t marry a wangfei full of misdeeds, not to mention that she isn\u2019t a virgin anymore! These pasts of Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang certainly doesn\u2019t know them!</p><br/><p>Nobody spoke against Longze Yu Er\u2019s words. Longze Yu, Duanmu Qing and Murong Xue Lian only listened, nobody stopped her.</p><br/><p>Seeing all of these people with the appearance of spectators, Murong Qi Qi sneered in her heart. Just now when Feng Cang was here, they were like mouse seeing cat. They didn\u2019t even dare to breath loudly. Now they didn\u2019t have any care and said what they wanted. Really dog eyes who looked down at people!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Murong Qi Qi was about to counter attack, when a soft voce ringed in her ears. Feng Cang came back after changing into clean clothes.</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang, Longze Yu Er\u2019s expression changed. She didn\u2019t know if Feng Cang heard those sarcastic words or not\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, you finally came back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked up with a face full of grievances. Two sparkling tears rolled in those black and white eyes for a long time, before they finally rolled down her face and fell onto Feng Cang\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi cry, Feng Cang felt that his heart was also in pain. The aura of hostility on his body also broke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, who bullied you? After you tell benwang, benwang 8 will give you justice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words made Longze Yu\u2019s heart tremble.</p><br/><p>This Feng Cang is someone who says something and will definitely do it. Even if he is at Xi Qi country now, if he wants to kill someone, as an emperor Longze Yu is also unable to prevent it. Although Feng Cang only came with thousand eagle guards, but those thousand eagle guards are elites; one can kill hundred. It\u2019s not impossible if Feng Cang wants his palace to meet its demise.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s fingers circled around the entire banquet. She included everyone who wanted to watch a play, making Longze Yu\u2019s little e heart shook badly</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang pulled Murong Qi Qi into his embrace and gently wiped the tears for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that Xi Qi country already healed from the scar of fifteen years ago. That\u2019s why in everyone\u2019s eyes, Bei Zhou is nothing. Feng Cang is also nothing. So, that\u2019s why you dare to insult benwang\u2019s beloved consort\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang said those words very slowly and also extremely gently as if he was just telling something and didn\u2019t seem to have any lethal energy. But the people who heard those words, began to worry in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Everyone knows that Bei Zhou is the strongest amongst the four countries. Their military force is also the strongest and Bei Zhou\u2019s emperor Wanyan Lie is very ambitious. He likes the war very much and Feng Cang is a rare genius at war. Plus, the fact that this Nan Lin wang\u2019s personality is strange. If he really uses this as an excuse to declare war, the consequences will simply be disastrous!</p><br/><p>\u201cMisunderstanding, all was a misunderstanding!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu quickly tried to save everything and also continued to send signals at Murong Qi Qi to let her explain.</p><br/><p>Just now he has an expression that it\u2019s not related to him and now he is begging her? Is she Murong Qi Qi so good to speak to? Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mouth lifted. Her tears continued to spread, making Feng Cang anxious. He continued to wiped her tears. The cold aura on his body became more intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, they say I\u2019m rubbish and laughed at me that I can\u2019t do anything. I argued, but no one believed. Everyone bet that princess Xin and princess Ping Yang will win. No one believed in me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi voice was very soft full of innocence and grievances, making people who just listen to the sound will willingly protect this little poor thing.</p><br/><p>After hearing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words, Longze Yu almost vomited blood. What is called add oil and vinegar? What is called pour oil on the fire? How can Murong Qi Qi make up those words to have said it so smoothly? Not only was Longze Yu surprised, the other people who heard those words also almost fainted.</p><br/><p>Add oil and vinegar: exaggerate things</p><br/><p>Pour oil on the fire: enrage people and make matters worse</p><br/><p>It seems that this princess Zhao Yang can also invert the right and wrong! Ming Yue Cheng at a side revealed a meaningful smile. Just now he was worried that she will be insulted by people. Now it seems that his concerns are superfluous. This woman is a master at playing games!</p><br/><p>And seeing Murong Qi Qi act \u2018spoiled\u2019 to Feng Cang, Longze Jing Tian felt strange in his heart. If he had insisted, then will the one embracing her now be him?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I\u2019m not a rubbish. If you don\u2019t believe me, I can go compete with them! Really, I won\u2019t let you lose face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ce wangfei/ cefei: second ranked wife of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Niangniang: used to call a female of the imperial family by someon of lower rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>Er: term of endearment \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wang/ wangye: prince of the first rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>Fu: residence/ mansion \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wangfei: main wife of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family \u21a9</p><br/><p>Benwang: I, used by a wangye</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi returned to the wangfu, immediately there were people who cheered. Then, housekeeper Feng Qi led people to bow at Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, \u201cCongratulations wangye2! Congratulations wangfei3!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDispense with curtsying\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi like a princess and rushed into Tingsong building, leaving the dumbfounded people who looked at the just disappeared gust of wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that we have to prepare,\u201d Feng Qi laughed. The people didn\u2019t understand what Feng Qi meant. They looked at him puzzled. Feng Qi knocked on the heads of the few people behind him. \u201cFools! Wangye is in such a rush\u2026haha\u2026of course we must prepare to receive the young master, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026,\u201d Hearing Feng Qi say that, they suddenly came to the realization. That\u2019s right, ah! Nan Lin wangfu had been quiet for so long. If there\u2019s a young master, how great would that be?! Everyone was imagining a beautiful picture. Each one of them giggled foolishly.</p><br/><p>Inside Tingsong building, Feng Cang entered the wedding room. He put Murong Qi Qi down and sat opposite her. He looked at her and laughed foolishly.</p><br/><p>If an ordinary person laughed foolishly, he/she would appear honest. However, Feng Cang\u2019s foolish laughter was very adorable. Not speaking and without body language, he only sat there and looked foolishly at Murong Qi Qi. He didn\u2019t move a bit. On his face hung a bright smile. His phoenix eyes carefully gazed Murong Qi Qi. His whole person seemed to beam and he was happy as if he ate honey.</p><br/><p>After being stared for long time by Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi finally yielded under the deep love in his eyes. Her face got red.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi discovered that since getting to know Feng Cang, no matter if it was flirting or passing current with their eyes, in the end the one who would be defeated was always her. When would she regain one win?! She really looked forward to that day, ah!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was dressed very festively. Plus with her shyness, her face became rouge, making Feng Cang\u2019s heart beat very fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, you\u2019re so beautiful\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang pulled Murong Qi Qi into his arms. Soft lips fell on her forehead. His eyes were filled with tenderness and love.</p><br/><p>This kiss crushed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s fantasy world, making her wake up.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the matter with her? She was actually greedy for Feng Cang\u2019s gentleness and embrace?</p><br/><p>If she didn\u2019t get to know that matter, then she would continue to enjoy and spent her wedding night happily and shyly.</p><br/><p>However, now there\u2019s a possibility that she\u2019s Feng Cang\u2019s little sister. This person in front of her who she deeply loves and he also deeply loves her may be blood related with her. If she let her own feelings take over and eagerly enjoy the intimacy; if they\u2019re truly biological siblings, then in the future it\u2019s two people who will suffer. She couldn\u2019t be so selfish and also couldn\u2019t make the decision for Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Feng Cang keenly caught on that Murong Qi Qi was \u2018absentminded\u2019. \u201cQing Qing, are you not feeling well? Why does your face look so bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know how to say it.</p><br/><p>The most direct way is to take of the Water Moon Mirror and tell Feng Cang she may be his little sister. The result is Feng Cang would be surprised, sad and hurt. However, if she doesn\u2019t do it like that, then what should she do later when it\u2019s time to spend the wedding night? Could it be\u2026no can\u2019t! She looked for seventy, eighty percent like Wanyan Ming Yue. If by chance she\u2019s Feng Xie\u2019s daughter, Feng Cang\u2019s little sister, then wouldn\u2019t they be truly in a mess?!</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s change so many expression, Feng Cang chuckled. He took her into his embrace. \u201cQing Qing, are you afraid? Is it that you aren\u2019t prepared yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d Murong Qi Qi was surprised for a moment and didn\u2019t understand what Feng Cang meant.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi was so innocent, Feng Cang sighed. He gently hugged her. His clean chin was on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead, \u201cI heard, when a girl becomes a woman, the first time would be very painful. Is Qing Qing afraid? If it\u2019s like that, I can wait; wait till you\u2019re ready to accept me before we do the wedding night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi finally understood after Feng Cang\u2019s words. This man is really\u2026she didn\u2019t know what to say. So considerate, so thoughtful and so gentle; if they didn\u2019t have any blood relation, how happy would she be?!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t say anything. She only cried. She nestled in Feng Cang\u2019s arms like a well-behaved cat. Her being like this made Feng Cang feel more that she was afraid of the wedding night and that her heart had fear. So, he pitied her even more. He didn\u2019t want to force her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let you become mine when you don\u2019t allow it. I love you. I love everything about you. I\u2019m willing to wait! Qing Qing being like this maybe it\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t good enough. Maybe if our feelings were deeper then Qing Qing would be able to let go and accept me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang gently kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s tears. Like comforting a child, he gently patted Murong Qi Qi\u2019s back. \u201cBe good! Don\u2019t be afraid! It was I who was too anxious! I\u2019m willing to wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was being so considerate and so gently made Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but cry out loudly. She rushed into Feng Cang\u2019s arm and cried loudly like a child who suffered grievances. She wanted to release all the gloominess in her heart.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang panicked after seeing Murong Qi Qi cry. He quickly comforted, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s the matter? Did someone bully you? Qing Qing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Murong Qi Qi hugged Feng Cang\u2019s neck. Her tears fell on Feng Cang\u2019s black hair. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid! I\u2019m so afraid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018afraid\u2019 made Feng Cang\u2019s heart tremble a bit. Could it be that she\u2019s worried about that her fate would be the same as those women? Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small body trembled slightly because of sobbing. Feng Cang tightly hugged her and felt much ache in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault! It\u2019s me who let you be afraid\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang felt much pain for the small person in his arms. It seemed that she always had been strong and optimistic. No matter if it was laziness or slyness, no matter if she was kind or scheming; he had seen it all. However, this was the first time Feng Cang saw such a her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s apology made Murong Qi Qi sadder. She shook her head and cried stronger, \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s not you! It\u2019s me who is worried, who is afraid. I\u2019m afraid that we would separate. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll leave me! Woo, woo, woo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi cried helplessly like a child making Feng Cang panic. He repeatedly comforted, \u201cHow would that be?! We\u2019ll be together forever. I won\u2019t leave you and you also won\u2019t leave me! When alive we\u2019ll sleep in the same bed, when we die, we\u2019ll lie in the same tomb. We will always be together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was so optimistic made the bitterness in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart become stronger. How could she have the heart to hurt such a Feng Cang?! If he knew she\u2019s his little sister, what kind of blow would he receive?!</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Qi Qi made a decision. She would hide the truth and won\u2019t tell Feng Cang. No matter what the result is, let her be the one to endure everything.</p><br/><p>She would give him a complete love till they avenged their parents, till she leaves, she needs to keep this matter a secret. By then, she would ask senior brother Jin Mo to help her, saying she got a weird disease and needs to recuperate alone. When she left, she would let Jin Mo tell Feng Cang she died. This way, she gave Feng Cang a love and also retain the most beautiful image in Feng Cang\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>After making this decision, Murong Qi Qi gradually stopped crying. She nestled in Feng Cang\u2019s arms. Her small face was close to his chest and listened to his heartbeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle cat isn\u2019t crying anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Murong Qi Qi who was crying earth-shatteringly, now calmed down. Feng Cang\u2019s heart also calmed down because of Murong Qi Qi. He didn\u2019t expect this girl to be so sensitive and cried like this because she was afraid they\u2019ll separate! This little woman, ah, should he say she\u2019s sensitive or foolish?! Since he took her hand, he would not let go for this whole life even if it\u2019s through mountains of daggers and seas of flames. He wouldn\u2019t care even if the blue sea turned into mulberry fields!</p><br/><p>Mountains of dagger and seas of flames: extreme danger</p><br/><p>The blue sea turned into mulberry fields: the transformation of the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a little cat!\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s nose was red and her face still had tears. Because her voice was choked, the words she said was low and muffled like as if she was acting cute. Feng Cang couldn\u2019t help but pinch her red nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle cat, are you hungry? What do you want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s reminder made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s stomach grumble very cooperatively. Immediately, Murong Qi Qi was ashamed and buried her head in Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d The appearance of the little person in his arms made Feng Cang laugh loudly. Immediately he let people serve Murong Qi Qi a bath and after bathing a meal.</p><br/><p>When a fresh Feng Cang appeared, Murong Qi Qi was already sitting in front of a rich dinner. She also finished taking a bath. Aside from the somewhat red eyes which showed that she cried, Murong Qi Qi changed into a pink pajama. She was fresh like lotus coming out of water, beautiful and moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, you\u2019ve arrived!\u201d Murong Qi Qi raised her head and revealed a smile, \u201cCome quickly. I\u2019m so hungry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang sat beside Murong Qi Qi and once again kissed her forehead, \u201cYou should eat first if you\u2019re hungry! Don\u2019t wait for me! If you go hungry, I will feel bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words of affection coming out of Feng Cang was so natural as if he was born for Murong Qi Qi\u2019s love. Murong Qi Qi smiled while putting dishes on Feng Cang\u2019s plate, \u201cWithout wangye here, the dishes won\u2019t taste good!\u201d</p><br/><p>This little woman is now joking with him which meant her mood is now better. Feng Cang\u2019s heart finally eased down. He personally poured wine and gave it to Murong Qi Qi. \u201cAfter formally exchanging cups of wine, we\u2019ll officially be husband and wife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the wine inside the jade cup, Murong Qi Qi paused. Inside her heart a voice was screaming, \u201cDrink! After drinking it, you\u2019ll be husband and wife! Even if you can\u2019t be real husband and wife, but like this, you should also be contended!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi took the cup of wine and drank with Feng Cang while crossing their arms.</p><br/><p>After drinking the wine, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips was red like rose petals. On her lips were drops of wine emitting a sweet scent. Feng Cang stared at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s red lips. His throat moved. Very hard, he pressed his desire down.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t be like this! Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart hasn\u2019t eased down yet. He couldn\u2019t let her be afraid. He couldn\u2019t scare her!</p><br/><p>To divert his attention, Feng Cang put dishes into Murong Qi Qi\u2019s plate, \u201cEat slowly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Because she was hungry for a long time, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s stomach had been grumbling. Now with these foods here, of course she needed to fill her stomach first.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi was eating a warm dinner in Tingsong building. Under Long Autumn palace, Yue Lan Zhi already fainted from the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Wanyan Lie quickly took out the whistle and blew. From the whistle came a sound humans couldn\u2019t understand, but it triggered the mother gu in Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Two \u2018googoo\u2019 sounds came from Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s body. The original sleeping mother gu had been awakened. Because it\u2019s beautiful dream was disturbed by force, the mother gu seemed very unhappy. Inside Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s belly, it became grumpy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d The pain from her belly made Yue Lan Zhi wake up from the fainting. Her originally flat belly seemed to have stirred. Something the size of a ping-pong ball appeared at her navel. It turned very fast.</p><br/><p>Because someone disturbed that mother gu from its sleep, its temper was particularly irritable. It bared it fangs and teared the insides of Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s belly. It swallowed Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s belly, leaving only a thin layer of human skin.</p><br/><p>Across the human skin, you can clearly see the mother gu\u2019s red body. It seemed to vent its anger inside Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s body. While it was at it, it ate Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s meat to meet it nutritional needs.</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi swore that she never had experienced this kind of pain before. Even when Wanyan Lie cut her arms just now, it was cut fast and neatly. Although she felt pain, but it wasn\u2019t torture.</p><br/><p>And this, this was endless pain. Her insides were eaten bit by bit by the mother gu. The sounds its teeth made, made people feel afraid from deep inside their bones.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t the first time eunuch Jing De, who was standing at a side saw this. However, when the tragedy once again played, he still didn\u2019t dare to look. He only could lower his head and frown. His lips were in a tight line. He tried his best to not let himself go look at that miserable scene.</p><br/><p>At the other side, when the substitute of Wanyan Ming Yue who had been brought her by Jing De saw this scene, she was overwhelmed by fear and went limply on the ground. She had never seen such a horrifying scene. It\u2019s so scary! That red worm was pasted on Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s skin as if it wanted to look at her through that skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026,\u201d Yue Lan Zhi didn\u2019t scream. It was this young girl who screamed first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er4, don\u2019t be afraid! Zhen5 is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the whole dungeon, Wanyan Lie\u2019s expression was the calmest. He was so calm that it was somewhat sick. He helped the young girl stand up. He tightly embraced her waist to avoid her fall on the ground once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, what is that? So frightening!\u201d The young girl raised her head and looked pitifully at Wanyan Lie. She had never thought that she would experience such a thing. What kind of frightening thing is that? Why is it inside that woman\u2019s body?</p><br/><p>The fear of the young girl made Wanyan Lie in a good mood. He liked to see the fear in people\u2019s eyes. He particularly like that kind of fear and panic. \u201cYue er, be good. Don\u2019t be afraid! She wasn\u2019t good, so zhen used this worm to torture her. As long as you listen well to zhen, zhen would certainly pamper you! And would definitely not let you suffer any bitterness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s voice had a magic to it. Seeing the sincerity and respect in the eyes of this emperor, the young girl\u2019s heart slightly trembled. She nestled into Wanyan Lie\u2019s embrace, \u201cEmperor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl\u2019s throwing herself in his arms made a trace of disgust appear and disappear in Wanyan Lie\u2019s face. His Yue er definitely wouldn\u2019t have yield so easily in front of a man. No matter how much this woman looked like Yue er, but in the end, she couldn\u2019t be compared to her!</p><br/><p>The young girl didn\u2019t know that her actions had left a shadow in Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart. And this shadow may accompany her later life and also determine her life and death.</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi only had one breath left. She had fainted many times and every time had she been woken up by the pain.</p><br/><p>That mother gu went along Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s body and climbed up. It tore off her internal organs and eat them. Her eyes had been turned hazy by sweat. She could only see a few shadows of the people in front of her. Her voice also became hoarse because of the continued shouting. Now she could only make a low \u2018ah\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026,\u201d While appeasing the young girl in his arms, Wanyan Lie looked smilingly at Yue Lan Zhi.</p><br/><p>At this time, Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s abdomen and back had almost been fully eaten by the mother gu. Only a thin layer of skin was left. The skin was bright. From this side of skin, you would be able to look to the other side of the skin. The mother gu continued to climb up along Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s vertebra. It arrived at her chest and climbed on her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d When the mother gu fiercely bit down, Yue Lan Zhi could feel the intense convulsion from her heart.</p><br/><p>Painful! Pain that even words was unable to describe. She fiercely bit on her lips. Her hair was wet from sweat. The hair lay wet on her forehead. The original beautiful facial features distorted from pain. She finally realized the feeling of death. Unspeakable, living was more painful than death.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmp\u2026emperor\u2026\u201d Probably because she knew she was about to die, Yue Lan Zhi raised her head and looked at the man not far away. Once, he treated her gently and pampered her like never before. He let her become the most envious golden canary inside this golden cage. Those were her beautiful memories, \u201cEmperor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, niangniang6 seemed to have something to say to you,\u201d Jing De said in a low voice after he came to Wanyan Lie\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Wanyan Lie held the young girl and came to Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s side. On his face was not a bit of pity, \u201cYou called zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor\u2026did, did you ever\u2026like me\u2026even a bit\u2026\u201d This sentence, Yue Lan Zhi said it after a few breaths and it took a long time to finished.</p><br/><p>Looking at that face of Yue Lan Zhi which was similar to the one in his memories, Wanyan Lie sneered. His thin lips went near Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s ear, \u201cZhen had never liked you, never ever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Yue Lan Zhi didn\u2019t finish laughing when she turned her head. She bit on Wanyan Lie\u2019s left ear. She bit fiercely and used the strength of her whole body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d This time the one who screamed was Wanyan Lie. He wanted to struggle, but unfortunately Yue Lan Zhi bit fiercely. If he struggled, the ear would certainly tear. \u201cQuickly, quickly, kill her!\u201d Wanyan Lie was in much pain and quickly ordered Jing De.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

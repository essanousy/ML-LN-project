Especially the last \u2018crown prince\u2019 made Duanmu Qing feel really good. She stroked her belly as if she\u2019ll immediately be able to conceive a boy and the moment he is born, he\u2019ll inherit the empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter bengong1 gives birth to the crown prince, the first one to reward is you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after Duanmu Qing went back to Qing Luan Palace, Longze Yu came over. Duanmu Qing was very surprised at seeing Longze Yu. Could it be that he already knew of the matter with Jin Mo? She hadn\u2019t thought of a good explanation yet! The emperor already didn\u2019t love her. If he used that excuse and put the blame on Duanmu family for colluding with Bei Zhou, then what should she do? In just one moment, Duanmu Qing\u2019s mind had already turned thousands times. Her palms had become wet because she was so tense.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress, zhen2 has come today to tell you something.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing that Duanmu Qing expected didn\u2019t happen. Longze Yu changed his normal attitude and sat beside her. He put her hands into his palm. Such intimate action made Duanmu Qing startled. How long had it been since they had such intimate action? One year, three years or has it been five years? Even Duanmu Qing herself didn\u2019t remember anymore.</p><br/><p>Longze Yu was unaware of the difference in Duanmu Qing. He was just still angry about the thing from a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, zhen received a marriage proposal from Bei Zhou. Wanyan Lie wants zhen to marry a princess over! You also know, our national forces simply can\u2019t compete with that of Bei Zhou\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWanyan Lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not what she thought, Duanmu Qing immediately felt relaxed. But the moment she thought about the princesses who were at a marriageable age, only her daughter Longze Yu Er was at a marriageable age, Duanmu Qing immediately panicked.</p><br/><p>Looking at the frown on this man in front of her who has accompanied her for many years, Duanmu Qing spoke carefully: \u201cEmperor, you are not thinking of marrying Yu Er over, right? But Wanyan Lie\u2019s age, he could already be her father!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu pulled Duanmu Qing in his embrace. His chin was against Duanmu Qing\u2019s hair. His voice also became sad: \u201cWanyan Lie is asking marriage for Nan Lin wang 3 Feng Cang! I heard that Feng Cang\u2019s body has always not been good. Wanyan Lie wants to let a princess marry over for the peace and tochongxi for Feng Cang\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chongxi: arrange a wedding for a very ill young man with the hope that the \u2019event of great joy\u2019 will drive away his bad luck and hasten his recovery</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the words Nan Lin wang Feng Cang, Duanmu Qing\u2019s heart went into her throat once again.</p><br/><p>Connecting the matter of now and that of before, Duanmu Qing finally understood why today Jin Mo took such a big risk to go see her. Could it be that it was because she is the future mother-in-law of his master? So it was like that, ah! So it was like that, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, this cannot happen! In this world, who doesn\u2019t know that Nan Lin wang has a violent personality, is cursed and caused the death of eight wives. Now Wanyan Lie wants our Yu Er to marry over, isn\u2019t that pushing her into a pit of fire?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just thinking about those rumors of Feng Cang, Duanmu Qing couldn\u2019t help but shudder. Bloodthirsty, cold, without love\u2026\u2026Making her daughter marry such a demon, even if she dies, she wouldn\u2019t agree!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing\u2019s reaction was in the expectation of Longze Yu, but he couldn\u2019t help it! Bei Zhou has strong soldiers and sturdy horses and Nan Lin wang Feng Cang commanded the army like a god. If he doesn\u2019t agree and angered Bei Zhou, the consequences were simply unimaginably disastrous!</p><br/><p>Strong soldiers and sturdy horses: a well-trained and powerful army.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress, zhen also doesn\u2019t want it to be like this. The war at Yandang Mountain of that year, Xi Qi lost 400,000 men. Although fifteen years had passed, our country had only just recovered our strength. We don\u2019t have the ability to fight with the powerful Bei Zhou, ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time, Longze Yu felt failure. He was not a qualified father. Even if he knew that it\u2019s a pit of fire, he still had to send over his own daughter, because he was incompetent and he couldn\u2019t say no to Wanyan Lie\u2019s proposal.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress, zhen is sorry to you, sorry to Yu Er\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>A figure in yellow rushed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father, empress mother, daughter doesn\u2019t want to marry demon wang! Don\u2019t want to marry him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her daughter\u2019s face full of tears, Duanmu Qing\u2019s heart felt very painful. She immediately moved away from Longze Yu\u2019s embrace and pulled Longze Yu Er into her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er, empress mother won\u2019t let you marry him! Won\u2019t let you go chongxi for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMuddleheaded!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Duanmu Qing\u2019s muddleheaded words, Longze Yu opened his mouth to reprimand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you want to let go of the citizens of Xi Qi country because of Yu Er?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father, why is it daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Longze Yu\u2019s words, Longze Yu Er, immediately stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father can bestow the title of princess on a daughter of an official and let her marry in the place of daughter! Weren\u2019t there such examples in the past? Why must daughter marry over?! Bei Zhou only said they wanted a princess. They didn\u2019t say it must be a princess from the royal bloodline!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s words made the original troubled heart of Longze Yu brighten up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, ah! It can be like that! How come zhen has forgotten?! It was zhen who panicked!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Longze Yu said that, Duanmu Qing was immediately aware that there\u2019s a turning point. She must strike the iron while it\u2019s hot and consolidate his ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho should become princess?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Longze Yu was thinking about this problem, Duanmu Qing was also thinking about it. Searching through the four great families as well as officials with high posts; to find a suitable candidate was really not easy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly in Duanmu Qing\u2019s mind emerged a figure, Murong Qi Qi. After thinking it through, Duanmu Qing finally decided to push Murong Qi Qi as the \u2018scapegoat\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, this subject consort has one candidate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing waved at Longze Yu Er to let her excuse herself. She went to Longze Yu\u2019s side and told him everything that had happened today, but she concealed the fact that Murong Qi Qi gave her a \u2018having children\u2019 pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing Tian wrote a letter of breaking the engagement?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that Longze Jing Tian broke off the engagement with Murong Qi Qi, Longze Yu was somewhat surprised. In the surprise, he also understood the reason. He understood his son. He was such a proud and arrogant person, how could he accept a rubbish as wife?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright that he broke it! Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reputation doesn\u2019t seem that good. If we let her marry over, zhen is afraid that they will not accept\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, if it really cannot be helped, we can give her more dowry. Beside the mountain is high and the road is far, by the time the rumors here spread over to Bei Zhou, she had long married over. Whether she can or cannot survive the wedding night is still a question!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing took the initiative and held Longze Yu. Her voice was surprisingly gentle. Although her mouth was saying that but in her heart, she had another idea.</p><br/><p>She was eager for Murong Qi Qi\u2019s bad reputation to be spread far and wide and to let Fang Cang know the truth quickly, that Murong Qi Qi was just a woman to warm the bed. By that time, if Bei Zhou came to demand an explanation, then she could say that they all have been lied to by Murong family. By that time, she wanted to see how much longer Longze Yu could protect Murong family! If Murong family was ruined, she\u2019d like to see how Murong Xue Lian, that bitch, coudl still show off in the palace!</p><br/><p>After hearing Duanmu Qing, Longze Yu was in a good mood. Just now, the tough problems, which made him get a headache, has been solved so easily. Now Longze Yu had completely accepted Duanmu Qing\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing er4, you really are zhen\u2019s good empress, ah! Tonight, zhen will rest here!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Bengong: this palace, I used by the females of the imperial family</p><br/><p>2. Zhen: I, used by the emperor </p><br/><p>3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>4. Er: term of endearment</p><br/>\n</div>"}

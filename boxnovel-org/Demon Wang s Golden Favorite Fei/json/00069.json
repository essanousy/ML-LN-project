That night, you played \u2018A glance at the mundane world\u2019 under the moonlight. It\u2019s at that time when your self-confidence and pride was engraved in my heart. Like a warm day, it lightened up my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about those memories, Feng Cang\u2019s voice became exceptionally gentle. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s describing the best thing he had ever encountered in his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, you were accidentally bestowed the title of princess Zhao Yang and had to become my wife. The moment I got that news, I was so excited. I won\u2019t hide this from Qing Qing. In fact, I was planning to use some means to let you marry me. But I didn\u2019t expect that everything would be destined by heaven; that you would become the princess to form a marriage alliance. Qing Qing, you say, is this not fate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing this Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words unlocked all of the doubts that were in her heart. No wonder he let Feng Yu and Nalan Xin go to Murong fu to teach her those things. No wonder he couldn\u2019t wait to move the entire wangfu2. No wonder he protected her like that at the banquet. No wonder\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that Murong Qi Qi doesn\u2019t know how to face Feng Cang\u2019s adoring confession. Such an excellent and affectionate Feng Cang made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart become timid. She was somewhat afraid; afraid that Feng Cang had too high expectations of her and that she would disappoint him.</p><br/><p>Looking at her own image inside Feng Cang\u2019s black eyes, Murong Qi Qi wanted to back down, but Feng Cang trapped her in his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Qing Qing afraid of me or does Qing Qing loathe me? Is it that Qing Qing also heard those rumors and became scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s injured voice sounded once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice was like the wind chiming under the eaves. The moment the wind breeze passed by, sad music would play. In the end, Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer and also embraced Feng Cang. Why is this man\u2019s smile so warm, but his body is so cold? Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart gave birth to pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye3, I\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t understand love. I\u2019ve never experienced such a thing. I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Murong Qi Qi has bared her own heart. She also didn\u2019t know why she was able to reveal this. Maybe it\u2019s because she felt trust from Feng Cang. Maybe it\u2019s because she also wanted to get a taste of love\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Such frank words coming from Murong Qi Qi made Feng Cang\u2019s heart beat very fast.</p><br/><p>Does this mean that in her heart, there\u2019s now a small bit of trust for him? Does this mean that she\u2019s slowly beginning to open her heart to him? So, the barrier of her heart is this. She is worried that she will not do well. This little wangfei4, ah. Really silly, na\u00efve and cute!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can teach you, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside Feng Cang\u2019s voice, there was a trace of laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we slowly learn together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlowly learn together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s first reaction was to verify carefully.</p><br/><p>This seemed to be a good way. Adopted father didn\u2019t teach her this, so maybe Feng Cang can teach her. It\u2019s just that why did she see some pride and some small calculation in Feng Cang\u2019s eyes? Why does she have a feeling like she\u2019s a sheep falling into a tiger\u2019s mouth?</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, this is the first time you threw yourself into my arms!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi was in a daze again, the laughter in Feng Cang\u2019s eyes became stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, I thought that Xi Qi\u2019s women are reserved. Only now do I know that Qing Qing is so hot and passionate. Really\u2026\u2026 very charming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d Only now did Murong Qi Qi remember that she\u2019s still embracing Feng Cang. Immediately, she pushed him away. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too late. Feng Cang had already circled her into his arms. Strong arms trapped her; not letting Murong Qi Qi get away.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang, let me go. Everyone is watching!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the laughter around them, Murong Qi Qi discovered that they had become the focus of everyone. Immediately, her cheeks became red. Even her ears became red.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot letting go. Not letting go for a whole lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s pinkish face let Feng Cang\u2019s mood become very good. Once again, he laughed out loud. That radiant look made every woman nearby lose their soul. Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die\u2019s faces both have looks of infatuation.</p><br/><p>From Feng Cang\u2019s embrace, Murong Qi Qi saw the infatuation of those women. Inexplicably, she felt a bit unhappy and there was a block in her heart. Since she had just opened her mind and told Feng Cang her feelings, the seal between them had separated. Murong Qi Qi was no longer acting cautious.</p><br/><p>Adopted father said to follow your heart. He was probably speaking about expressing her true feelings to let the other person know. So, now Murong Qi Qi was feeling unhappy. She immediately reached out and grabbed Feng Cang\u2019s face to let him look at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, you are too able at fondling flowers and trampling grass! This makes me very unhappy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fondling flowers and trampling grass: to womanize.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s angry small face with the pinkish blush on her cheeks matched the burning small flame in her eyes, and it made Feng Cang lose his soul. So, it turned out that she\u2019s so beautiful when angry!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to understand, she felt something warm at her forehead. Feng Cang gently kissed her forehead in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>Pupupu\u2026\u2026 Murong Qi Qi could hear her heart beating; it\u2019s fast like a small pony running. She didn\u2019t move and didn\u2019t dare to move. She only foolishly opened her eyes widely.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reaction made Feng Cang want to dote on her even more. Although he only kissed her forehead, but her smooth skin which exuded a fragrance of green apple, made him unable to stop.</p><br/><p>No, he can\u2019t! Only just now, his little wangfei opened her heart to him. He can\u2019t force her too much lest she would flee.</p><br/><p>Thinking till her, Feng Cang\u2019s lips left Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead. He had known that her taste is sweet, but he hadn\u2019t expected that with a simple kiss, she could let him become bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, my heart only has you. My eyes also only have you. You must believe in me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand to his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it: there are so many potential lovers to choose from, but you only pick one from among those potential lovers.</p><br/><p>Li: Chinese mile: 500 meters</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang said \u2018Ruo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it\u2019, the dance in Taiji Hall stopped right at that moment. It was so quiet that the silence highlighted Feng Cang\u2019s voice even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said! A very well \u2018Ruo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it\u2019,\u201d Wanyan Lie praised. The intimate interaction between Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Lie saw very well from above. Now that Feng Cang had said such an oath, it could be seen that the feelings between the two were excellent.</p><br/><p>The feelings of his nephew have found an owner; he, as an uncle, was naturally happy. However, to unlock empress dowager\u2019s heart, it was not a simple matter. This was a big problem.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi having a good relation was something that both Li Bing and Lin Ke Xin agreed on. Who didn\u2019t know that in Nan Lin wang\u2019s hands, there\u2019s military power and he also had the favor of Wanyan Lie? If it wasn\u2019t because his body was weak which made Wanyan Lie dispel the idea of passing the throne to him, the dynasty would have long changed surnames and become Feng Cang\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Now, Feng Cang liked Murong Qi Qi. This let Li Bing and Lin Ke Xin feel relieved.</p><br/><p>The previous wangfei of Feng Cang were all rich and noble. If they had formed an alliance, they would have become his powerful allies. By then, even if their sons ascended the throne, Feng Cang would have been a danger. Fortunately, those women didn\u2019t have a long life. Don\u2019t know if they had bad luck or Feng Cang\u2019s life was too hard. In short, they all died.</p><br/><p>Now, Feng Cang was forming a marriage alliance with Murong Qi Qi, the rumored rubbish; this made the empress and consort De very happy.</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi was a princess, but behind her was Xi Qi, was Murong Tai! Although Xi Qi and Bei Zhou acted amiably on the surface, but thanks to Wanyan Lie\u2019s ambition, sooner or later there would be a battle with Xi Qi.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s really a battle, then Murong Qi Qi being in the middle as well as Feng Cang being Xi Qi\u2019s prime minister\u2019s son-in-law would certainly gain criticism. Maybe at that time, they take away the military from Feng Cang. Not to mention that the empress dowager really disliked Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s future days didn\u2019t look good.</p><br/><p>So, although these two people were always on the opposite side on other things, but regarding the matter of Feng Cang marrying Murong Qi Qi, they were absolutely on the same page.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, chenqie5 sees that princess Zhao Yang is someone who will arouse love and affection from people. Why don\u2019t chenqie take her for a walk around the palace! Our Bei Zhou\u2019s scenery is different from Xi Qi\u2019s. Presumably, princess hasn\u2019t seen it yet! What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin being understanding made Wanyan Lie very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Consort De, you take Qi Qi out for a walk. Let her become familiar with the environment. In the future, come to play frequently at the palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Chenqie obeys emperor\u2019s command!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father! I also wants to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu saw that Consort De wanted to take Murong Qi Qi for a walk at the palace, so she immediately stood up.</p><br/><p>Just now, Feng Cang\u2019s doting towards Murong Qi Qi made Wanyan Bao Zhu so jealous that her eyes almost fell out. It would not be easy to find another opportunity to be alone with Murong Qi Qi; how can she let it go? She must let Murong Qi Qi be in shame! This was what Wanyan Bao Zhu was thinking in her heart.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu acting like a spoiled little daughter amused Wanyan Lie so much that he laughed out loud. Being Wanyan Lie\u2019s only daughter and also because she had lost her mother at a young age, Wanyan Lie loved this princess Bao Zhu very much. Seeing that his daughter was willing to take the initiative to get along with Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Lie felt very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! All can go, all can go! Girls must have many topics to talk about! Crown princess, you also go! Yu Die, you also go. All the girls go! Young people should get together more often!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Wanyan Lie said those words, even if Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t want to go, she could only stand up. Being in someone else\u2019s territory, even if there\u2019s Feng Cang at her side, but Wanyan Lie was this country\u2019s biggest boss. She couldn\u2019t make things difficult for Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was somewhat worried. Although Murong Qi Qi was indeed smart, but now they were in Bei Zhou and not in Xi Qi. Would she be able to handle it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, rest assured!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi chuckled and gave Feng Cang an \u2018I\u2019m alright\u2019 gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s wangye\u2019s turn to wait for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words let Feng Cang remember Xi Qi\u2019s palace banquet. That day, one \u2018I\u2019ll wait for you\u2019 from Murong Qi Qi made his heart warm for a long time. Now, it\u2019s his turn to wait for her. This was not a bad thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cTroubling consort De!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang stood up and slightly bowed at Lin Ke Xin. Although he bowed, but it\u2019s also a warning. I put this person in your hands. If something happens to her, then don\u2019t blame me!</p><br/><p>How could the clever Consort De not understand the meaning behind Feng Cang\u2019s words?! It seemed that this time, Feng Cang really cared about princess Zhao Yang which was also what she wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNan Lin wang, rest assured! Bengong6 will definitely take good care of princess Zhao Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang personally put a light green hooded cloak on Murong Qi Qi and also carefully tied the strap for her. Only after putting a heater in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s arms did he let her go.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye really dotes on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin personally held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand with a kind smile. Under the empress\u2019s lead, a line of women left Taiji Hall.</p><br/><p>After leaving Taiji Hall, Lin Ke Xin first led Murong Qi Qi to her Jingxin palace. Later, Wanyan Bao Zhu proposed to go take a walk outside. Lin Ke Xin, because of the wind, got some headache, and asked crown princess Yu Shi Shi to take care of Murong Qi Qi. She (LKX) stayed inside Jingxin palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cNiangniang,7 seeing princess Bao Zhu\u2019s expression; it doesn\u2019t seem she has given up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin\u2019s old maid handed her a cup of hot ginseng tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, Nan Lin wang handed princess Zhao Yang to you. If princess Bao Zhu does something, then what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do? Humph! Bengong handed her over to crown princess. You say, if something really happens, old and new love, who would Nan Lin wang choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin\u2019s words made old maid Du cover her mouth to snicker.</p><br/><p>\u201cNiangniang still remembers such an old matter. The way I see it; there isn\u2019t a man who doesn\u2019t forgot the old and love the new. Not to mention Nan Lin wang, even emperor\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking till here, Du mama suddenly paused. She realized that she was too blunt and actually mentioned the thorn in Lin Ke Xin\u2019s heart. Not waiting for Lin Ke Xin to say anything, Du mama knelt in front of her and fiercely gave herself two slaps.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall you for being old and confused! Call you for saying the wrong thing! Call you for not remembering!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally Lin Ke Xin was somewhat angry, but seeing Du mama like that, the anger in her heart slightly subsided. Only after Du mama\u2019s old face turned red, did Lin Ke Xin open her mouth again: \u201cEnough, mama, in the future, don\u2019t say such words again. If this gets to the ears of the emperor, even bengong will not be able to protect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Thanks, niangniang! Thanks, niangniang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only when Lin Ke Xin nodded, did old maid Du stand up.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just the originally happy mood had been ruined by old maid Du words. Now, Lin Ke Xin\u2019s expression was somewhat ugly: \u201cHow is that one of Changqui palace doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering niangniang, after noble consort Yue got a miscarriage, she became sickly. Now, she lost a lot of weight and looks just like a sick beauty. The emperor still goes there every day. It\u2019s just that a string is stuck in noble consort\u2019s heart. Every day, she eats very little. I heard that now only thin bones are left on her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Even if she is skinny, the emperor still loves her,\u201d after hearing those words from old maid Du, Lin Ke Xin\u2019s voice couldn\u2019t help but get louder, making old maid Du hurriedly rush towards her and cover her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy niangniang, these words can only be said privately. If the emperor gets to know this, it\u2019ll be very troublesome! Could it be that you forgot beautiful lady Zhou\u2019s ending!\u201d</p><br/><p>Beautiful here doesn\u2019t mean beautiful. It\u2019s a rank. On a side note, every women in the palace is beautiful</p><br/><p>Old maid Du\u2019s words made Lin Ke Xin shudder.</p><br/><p>That beautiful lady Zhao only said one bad sentence about Yue Lan Zhi. When that had reached to Wanyan Lie\u2019s ears, her tongue was pulled out. Before she was a water-like beauty. Now, not only had she become a mute, but her legs had also been crippled. She could only pass the rest of her days in the cold palace. Really pitiful.</p><br/><p>However, just the thought of that one in Changqui palace would make an inexplicable anger rise in Lin Ke Xin\u2019s heart. That Yue Lan Zhi had only entered the palace for half a year, but had already jumped from a talented lady to the position of a noble consort. Such a speedy upgrade was unprecedented within the palace.</p><br/><p>Talented lady is one of the lowest ranks in the Chinese imperial harem. From low to high: talented ladies, beautiful ladies, noble ladies, ladies of bright countenance, ladies of bright deportment, ladies of handsome fairness, imperial concubines, consorts, noble consorts, imperial noble consorts and finally the empress. So, she jumped 7 ranks in half a year.</p><br/><p>Not only that, Wanyan Lie also bestowed her Changqui palace, which had always been the living place of the empress. Every month, most of the time he spent with her (YLZ). That\u2019s why she got pregnant quickly even though she had only lived in the palace for such a short time.</p><br/><p>Although in the end, Yue Lan Zhi couldn\u2019t protect the child, but it\u2019s obvious to all that Wanyan Lie doted on her. How can the once favored consort De accept this? No need to even mention the many women in the imperial harem waiting for the favor of the emperor.</p><br/><p>In this meat more than wolves, porridge more than monks harem, which piece of meat doesn\u2019t want to be eaten by the wolf? Which porridge was not begging the monk to eat it? However, this Yue Lan Zhi occupied Wanyan Lie and became the most favored of the harem. This let her inadvertently become the thorn in the women of the harem\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cServe her right! According to bengong, she miscarriaged because she accumulated too much resentment. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t keep the child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old maid Du got more frightened seeing that the more Lin Ke Xin talked, the angrier she (LKX) got. She quickly looked around. Only when she saw that there was no one around, did she let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cNiangniang, now she\u2019s favored. She\u2019s the meat for the emperor. You can\u2019t touch her. Bear with it a while longer! In this palace, there are many people who hate her. Naturally, there will be people who will deal with her. You should just protect the two princes, why bother with her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When old maid Du mentioned the princes, Lin Ke Xin\u2019s mood turned a lot better. Just the thought of her second son, the second prince Wanyan Yi of this dynasty, Lin Ke Xin finally revealed a smile.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie had five sons. She had given birth to two. That\u2019s why she was able to become Consort De. Lin Ke Xin was very proud of that. Although Wanyan Kang was a bit unruly, but Wanyan Yi was perfect and also the strongest competitor against the crown prince.</p><br/><p>Three forces hold the court. The literary officials are divided in two groups. The group led by the state head support the crown prince. The group led by the prime minister support Wanyan Yi.</p><br/><p>I searched for a translation for ?? (guozhang), but couldn\u2019t find one, so I decided to use state head. Guozhang is usually a position held by the emperor\u2019s father in law e.g the empress\u2019s father. It\u2019s a very high position.</p><br/><p>The military officials see Feng Cang as their leader, but they are loyal and support the emperor. Whoever gets Feng Cang\u2019s support would become the future emperor. It\u2019s just that Feng Cang wouldn\u2019t accept salt nor oil and has now become a candidate for the crown prince\u2019s position. This let Lin Ke Xin become somewhat worried. How to draw Feng Cang to their side and how to control him were the questions that consort De and empress were both thinking about\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He said that he would give up on Murong Qi Qi. Why would he come look for him now in private? Could it be to persuade him?</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Feng Cang to think it through, Ming Yue Cheng stepped on the clogs and came to him, \u201cNan Lin wang1 seemed very surprised at seeing me! It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t welcome me, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang wanted to deny, but the result was that he couldn\u2019t help but nod. Seeing Feng Cang being so direct, Ming Yue Cheng laughed, \u201cNan Lin wang is really a straightforward person. No wonder, she would like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng mentioned the woman they both love in common made Feng Cang\u2019s mood loosen slightly, \u201cYour majesty, this way please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you like, you can call me by my name. I also want to call you Feng Cang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s temper made Feng Cang began to understand why Murong Qi Qi would become friends with this person. He\u2019s indeed a frank and straightforward person,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang led Ming Yue to the study. Ming Yue Cheng didn\u2019t expect that there was one more person here\u2026Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>When she saw Ming Yue Cheng behind Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi nodded with a smile, \u201cTake a seat! When I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll come over!\u201d Murong Qi Qi was checking Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai\u2019s accounts. In front of her was an abacus made from pure gold. It made crackling knocking sound accompanied with a shining golden light, making Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s eyes almost dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, is it that you think I\u2019m too luxurious?\u201d While Murong Qi Qi fiddled with the beads of the abacus, she chatted with Ming Yue Cheng. \u201cEarning money is for spending it. These accounts are too complicated. Looking at it will make me get a headache. Using a gold abacus can stimulate my brain. Speaking of it, inside here there\u2019s your twenty percent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi said everything clear and logically. Ming Yue Cheng could only shake his head helplessly. This woman was always justified. He couldn\u2019t win from her!</p><br/><p>After sitting for a moment, Ming Yue Cheng said the reason why he came, \u201cI came today is because I want to understand one matter with Feng Cang. Do you have a gu inside of you? Is it that it had been a long time? That day on the palace banquet, I saw that your complexion wasn\u2019t right, so I paid a little attention to it. You also know that Nan Feng\u2019s Tibetan ethic group are specialized in using gu. My empress mother is a member of Tibetan ethnic group, so, I also know about some of the gu. I hope it would be some help for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The arrival of Ming Yue Cheng was beyond Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expectations. His purpose was even more surprising to the two. Before, Murong Qi Qi was thinking to look for an opportunity to go find Ming Yue Cheng and see if he could provide some information about the gu poison. She didn\u2019t expect that he actually came today for that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue, you have a way, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Murong Qi Qi stood up excitedly. She walked in two or three steps to Ming Yue Cheng. Her beautiful eyes looked at his face, making Ming Yue Cheng almost lose his soul.</p><br/><p>The woman in front of him is the one he loves, but her every happiness, every anger, every smile and every annoyance wasn\u2019t because of him but it was for another man. This made Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s heart very sad.</p><br/><p>Although he was sad, but while facing Murong Qi Qi, Ming Yue Cheng still smiled, \u201cIf I can cure Feng Cang, how will you repay me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s words let Feng Cang frown. He reached out and pulled Murong Qi Qi into his arms, \u201cWhat do you want? As long as it\u2019s within my ability, I will certainly satisfy you. If you want to set your thoughts on her, even if I die, I will not accept (the treatment)!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang showed his overbearing and strong attachment to Murong Qi Qi, making Ming Yue Cheng understand that the man in front of him, had the same heart as him towards Murong Qi Qi. Suddenly, the concern he had, lessened a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous! I only want her to increase my twenty percent of the profits of the Nan four states a bit. For example, forty percent, what do you think? I can\u2019t get the person, you can\u2019t let me not get the person, not get the money and be empty-handed, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng showed a frivolous attitude, making Feng Cang\u2019s relax a bit. When Murong Qi Qi heard the conditions Ming Yue Cheng proposed, she immediately nodded and accepted, \u201cAs long as you can cure him, I will give fifty percent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s attitude was like this, it made Ming Yue Cheng laugh. Their feelings for each other must be very deep. That was why they would consider for each other like this! It seemed, that even if he wanted to stick a needle in the gap, he couldn\u2019t stick inside\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAsking Feng Cang to please answer me first. When did you get the gu? Usually, when will it act? What are the symptoms when the poison is acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s expression turned serious. Feng Cang told him truthfully about the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let me check for you!\u201d Ming Yue Cheng put his hand on Feng Cang\u2019s wrists. After a long while did Ming Yue Cheng release his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a gu. It\u2019s the mother-child gu! You already have the child gu for ten years in you. To be able to lift the child gu, you must find the mother gu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter finding the mother gu, use the mother gu to lead the child gu out. Then, use hot oil to burn the mother and child gu to ashes at the same time. The gu poison will be eliminated. Then, slowly nurse back your body to health. Your body will get better.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Ming Yue Cheng said was something Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi already know. \u201cNow, the only thing we\u2019re not certain about is the mother gu. We don\u2019t know where the mother gu is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi, Ming Yue Cheng frowned. He recalled the appearance of Wanyan Lie when he saw him. Ming Yue Cheng got a bold assumption, \u201cWhen I arrived, I discovered that your emperor Wanyan Lie also has gu in his body. I don\u2019t know if the gu in his body is the mother gu you\u2019re searching for. If it is, then it would be very simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang exchanged a glance. If the mother gu they\u2019re searching for is really in Wanyan Lie\u2019s body, then Wanyan Lie truly is a sicko! He actually put the mother gu in his own body. Could it be that he really hated Feng Cang so much?</p><br/><p>The expressions on these two people\u2019s face made Ming Yue Cheng guess out some things. It seemed that Nan Lin wang wasn\u2019t as favored by Bei Zhou\u2019s emperor as he outside world thought. It turned out that no matter which country, the things of an imperial family were not as beautiful as seen on the surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mother gu will absorb the nutrients of the body. An adult mother gu will suck all the nutrients of the body in about half year and would need to change a host. If the mother gu is really in Wanyan Lie\u2019s body, it hasn\u2019t been there for a long time. Besides the former hosts of the mother gu should be dead now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that gu\u2019s were such scary creatures! Murong Qi Qi was fearful. They really had little understanding of the mother gu. Now, after hearing Ming Yue Cheng explain in detail, did they understand what kind of creatures gu\u2019s were.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue, how to lead the mother gu out? How to use the mother gu to lead out the child gu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who put the gu would use a special whistle to control the gu. As long as we can find this whistle, everything would be solved. However, a whistle is not used universally. One whistle could only control one gu. If you\u2019re certain that the gu in Wanyan Lie\u2019s body is the mother gu, then you must find the whistle that controls the mother gu. Otherwise, even if you kill Wanyan Lie, it won\u2019t be of any use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before, Murong Qi Qi thought that as long they find the mother gu and kill it, they would be able to solve the child gu in Feng Cang\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t expect that the mother-child gu is so different from the gu\u2019s she came in contact with. It was actually so complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Feng Cang thanked Ming Yue Cheng. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to find the whistle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s answer affirmed the doubts in Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s heart. It seemed that the gu on Wanyan Lie\u2019s body was indeed the mother gu. However, to determine where the mother gu is, the first thing to do was to find the whistle that controlled the mother gu. This matter shouldn\u2019t be difficult for Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, I\u2019m not busy. I can stay and help you. When you find the mother gu, I know how to control it. Why don\u2019t you hand me the task of destroying the mother-child gu? I mean if\u2026you believe in me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s voice just fell when Murong Qi Qi nodded and accepted. She looked at Feng Cang, \u201cCang, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing believes in Ming Yue, I believe in Qing Qing!\u201d Feng Cang smiled and held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand. All speech was left in what was not said.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang\u2019s relationship made Ming Yue Cheng envious. Perhaps, he wouldn\u2019t have such a love in this lifetime. Although, he was very regretful, but when Murong Qi Qi said that word \u2018good\u2019, Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s heart was very wide and open. Everything was worth for this word \u2018good\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your trust! If there\u2019s need of my help, I\u2019m available any time.\u201d Ming Yue Cheng said this Murong Qi Qi. No matter what, this woman gave him this world\u2019s most precious trust. He also need to be able to live up to it.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ming Yue Cheng had many questions. He wanted to ask Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi in person. For example, they are siblings; could it be that they aren\u2019t afraid of the constraints of morals. Are they not worried that their romance would get out and that it would cause a great uproar?</p><br/><p>These questions hovered in Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s heart for a long time. However, when he saw that the look in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s and Feng Cang\u2019s eyes when looking at each other were so firm, Ming Yue Cheng swallowed the questions that were on his lips. If it was true love, why care about those norms and constraints?!</p><br/><p>The three reached an agreement on the matter of the mother-child gu. Feng Cang personally sent Ming Yue Cheng out.</p><br/><p>Without anyone around, the two walked very slowly. No one spoke. It was unusually quiet. Only the clogs on Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s feet made \u2018kaka\u2019 sounds.</p><br/><p>After a very long time, Feng Cang opened his mouth first, \u201cI know that you helped me because of her, but I still want to thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng only chuckled at Feng Cang\u2019s gratitude. The purple hairband hung on the ear and lightly went with the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy empress mother once said, the highest state of loving someone is not about giving her happiness, but be able to walk away when seeing that she\u2019s happy. My empress mother\u2019s whole life was full of tragedies. I don\u2019t want the woman I love be like my empress mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking till here, Ming Yue Cheng suddenly stopped. He faced Feng Cang and looked at him with a serious expression, \u201cYou were right. Everything I did is because of Qi Qi. I only wish that she can be happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you die young because of the gu poison, although I can have one rival less and can take your stead to care for her, but I don\u2019t want her heart, her memories to be full of your shadow in her future days. Like that, I will lose my mind and go mad! Instead of hurting her because of jealousy, it\u2019s better to let you live well and take care of her for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Ming Yue Cheng suddenly turned around. With his back facing Feng Cang, he freely waved to Feng Cang, \u201cGo back! Don\u2019t need to send me! It would be alright if you reward be heavily afterwards! I like old wine the most. Remember to prepare a hundred jar for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s purple figure disappear, Feng Cang was finally certain that this person was like how Murong Qi Qi described. He\u2019s a real man. He (FC) didn\u2019t expect that he (MYC) was actually so easygoing!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! What I have here the most is wine! By then, I\u2019ll personally drink wine with you. Not going home if we aren\u2019t drunk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice spread to the far away Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s ear. Although, he (FC) was talking about wine, but Ming Yue Cheng knows that this was Feng Cang\u2019s promise to him. He (FC) will certainly take care of Murong Qi Qi this whole lifetime. This was enough\u2026</p><br/><p>At the palace, after Wanyan Yi died, Wanyan Lie was a bit down.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong was disposed and imprisoned at the South Mansion. Wanyan Yi died at Xia Yun X\u2019s hands. Now, he couldn\u2019t count on two sons. Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart suddenly got a lot older.</p><br/><p>Without Wanyan Yi, some officials supported to free Wanyan Hong and let him continue be the crown prince. However, how could Wanyan Lie not know what kind of character Wanyan Hong was? The crown prince is the future emperor. Wanyan Hong wasn\u2019t competent for this position. He didn\u2019t want Bei Zhou\u2019s citizen to sink into fire because of his decision.</p><br/><p>The crown prince\u2019s position being vacant was not a good thing. Because of Wanyan Yi\u2019s matter, Xia Yun Xi died at Bei Zhou. This made Wanyan Lie worry very much. If Dong Lu was unwilling to forgive and even start a war, then it would be a laborious matter.</p><br/><p>Outside, there were many rumors about this matter. It was nothing more than saying that the one behind it was Feng Cang. He didn\u2019t want to marry Xia Yun Xi. It happened that he could use Wanyan Yi and kill two birds with one stone, getting rid of these two people.</p><br/><p>Without Wanyan Yi as competitor, Feng Cang was one step closer to the throne. If Dong Lu wants to launch war because of Xia Yun Xi\u2019s matter, Feng Cang can lead the troops and go to battle. With his grip on the power, even if Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t want to make him the crown prince, he could also lead the army to revolt\u2026</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie heard these, but he didn\u2019t put it in his heart.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang revolt? Wanyan Lie wouldn\u2019t believe it. A few years ago, he had given Feng Cang the opportunity to revolt. He gave Bei Zhou\u2019s military power to Feng Cang. It was to stir up contradiction between his princes and Feng Cang, but Feng Cang had been smooth and steady. He didn\u2019t have any thoughts to offend the prestige of a monarch. This was much better than his sons.</p><br/><p>If Feng Cang wanted to seize the throne, the entire Bei Zhou\u2019s military power is in his hands; seizing the throne was just an easy matter. He didn\u2019t need to wait till the opportunity of Dong Lu sending the troops. Feng Cang didn\u2019t have any greed or desire. It was because he (WL) knew this, that was why Wanyan Lie was so at ease. At one side, he put the gu, at the other side, he put him in an important position. At one side he beat him, at the other side, he gave him candy.</p><br/><p>However, recently Feng Cang really was a bit unusual. It seemed that since Murong Qi Qi appeared, his no greed and no desire changed. The Feng Cang who had never put any things or people in his heart, after encountering Murong Qi Qi, he began to particularly care about her.</p><br/><p>Although, this thing seemed unimaginable to outsiders; they\u2019re blood related siblings, but in Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart, he gave them the biggest recognition and support.</p><br/><p>If he could, letting Feng Cang inherit the throne was not bad. Wanyan Lie had such thoughts, but he didn\u2019t tell anyone. He needed to deliberate this matter carefully. After all, if he wanted to let Feng Cang inherit, he still need to have to face those old school of the court. What\u2019s the best way to do it?</p><br/><p>Taking advantage that Murong Qi Qi was absent, Wanyan Lie went to Long Autumn palace. He went to the underground to see Wanyan Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know if it was because he didn\u2019t come for a long time, but Wanyan Lie discovered that Wanyan Ming Yue was more beautiful than before. In the past, she lay on the warm jade bed and always had a cold appearance. The expression of the Wanyan Ming Yue of now, softened a lot. There was also more gloss on her skin. She appeared more and more like before she went into a deep sleep.</p><br/><p>Could this be related to Murong Qi Qi? Could it be that Wanyan Ming Yue heard Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice at the top and knew that her daughter returned? That was why gradually signs of her about to wake up appeared? It seemed that Murong Qi Qi really was Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s blessing! It was really well that this -lost and then regained- child returned!</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er, are you about to wake up? Did you forgive big brother?\u201d Wanyan Lie grabbed Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hand excitedly.</p><br/><p>Her hand had temperature! This news shocked Wanyan Lie once again! Although, there was the warm jade bed and Wanyan Ming Yue had been in a sleeping state, but her temperature had been lower than ordinary people. Now, Wanyan Lie felt a temperature ordinary people should have on Wanyan Ming Yue. How could he not be excited?!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo great! So great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie shouted excitedly. Sensing the there was some moisture on his face, Wanyan Lie reached out and touched. Only then, did he discover that tears came out of his eyes. He waited for so many years, longed for so many years; finally, he felt Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s response. This was simply so great!</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial physician. Jing De, go summon the imperial physician!\u201d Because of excitement, Wanyan Lie let Jing De go find an imperial physician to check Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s pulse. Fortunately, Jing De maintained his rationality. He quickly stopped Wanyan Lie. \u201cEmperor, which imperial physician to you plan on to summon to come do a diagnosis? If the imperial physician knew that princess Ming Yue is still alive, what do you plan to do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jing De\u2019s words were like a bucket of cold water poured over Wanyan Lie making him wake up from the excitement.</p><br/><p>That was right, ah! In Bei Zhou, everyone knew that Wanyan Ming Yue was a dead person. If she reappears in front of everyone, what kind of thing will happen? Firstly, Jinxuan palace\u2019s empress dowager Dongfang Lan wouldn\u2019t let him off. She would surely investigate the matter of that years till the water recedes and the rocks appear!</p><br/><p>The water recedes, the rocks appear: the truth come to light</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Can\u2019t!\u201d Because of Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s matter, he already killed a lot of people. Now, Wanyan Ming Yue was about to wake up, he couldn\u2019t kill more people! He needed to accumulate merit and pray for blessings for Wanyan Ming Yue! She was willing to wake up. At least, it proved that she didn\u2019t hate him as much as before!</p><br/><p>The thought that he may be forgiven by Wanyan Ming Yue, the heavy stone that pressed Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart for sixteen years, finally became a lot lighter. The mood that was impacted by Wanyan Hong\u2019s and Wanyan Yi\u2019s matters also improved a lot.</p><br/><p>Looking at the glowing Wanyan Ming Yue, Wanyan lie felt even more that Murong Qi Qi was someone who brought prosperity to the parents. Although, her father Feng Xie was no longer here, but Wanyan Ming Yue significantly improved a lot. It seemed that Murong Qi Qi was her lucky star!</p><br/><p>Before, Wanyan Lie had some hesitation about the throne. Now, he set it down in his heart; Feng Cang as the emperor, Murong Qi Qi as the empress. This was the best match. And he, he will wait till Wanyan Ming Yue wake up and then leave here with her to start a new life.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

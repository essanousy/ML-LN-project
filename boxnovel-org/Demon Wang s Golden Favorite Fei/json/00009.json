If it wasn\u2019t because second miss remembered you, this third miss, do you think that I\u2019d want to make this trip on this hot day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui talked so much but had been directly rejected by Murong Qi Qi, making her lose face. At this time, Fei Cui was so angry that her cheeks had turned red. Her lips poured out a lot of nasty words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go look at who you are? You really think you are someone important? Speaking frankly, you are just rubbish. You actually dared to show colors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Fei Cui was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s head maid. Because she looked down on third miss\u2019s incompetence, she went to rely on Murong Xin Lian. Now, she is her confidante. If it wasn\u2019t because she knew that today Murong Qi Qi needed to come, Fei Cui would\u2019ve been too lazy to talk so much with this rubbish.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi narrowed her eyes and looked at Fei Cui\u2019s mouth. She didn\u2019t even calculate yet with Fei Cui for the things of the past. She didn\u2019t expect that Fei Cui\u2019s attitude had turned for the worst. One after another \u2018rubbish\u2019 coming out of her mouth, really made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart grow hairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice became very cold. Su Mei and Su Yue, who were familiar with her, understood that this was the foreshadow of miss\u2019s anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, I can\u2019t even talk? Who in the capital doesn\u2019t know that Murong third miss can\u2019t practice martial arts? Could it be that you are afraid that people will talk about it, ah?! You\u2019re so dull, that even the people around you have the same stupid look as you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui seemed to have not noticed that the surroundings have turned cold. In the end, she also criticized Su Mei and Su Yue who were standing behind Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>With extreme annoyance, Murong Qi Qi coldly said one sentence: \u201cSlap her mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Fei Cui to hear clearly, Su Mei had already appeared in front of her. \u2018Pa pa\u2019 two slaps on her face.</p><br/><p>These past few days had bored Su Mei to death. Seeing Fei Cui \u2018bullying\u2019 miss like this, her hands had long itched. So, just as the command left Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mouth, Su Mei rushed forward. The speed was fast. Fei Cui had no time to dodge.</p><br/><p>Su Mei was someone who practiced martial arts. The strength of her hand was great. With just two slaps, Fei Cui became confused and disoriented. Her eyes were seeing stars and two rows of red blood flew out of her nose.</p><br/><p>After Fei Cui came to, she saw the smiling Su Mei and she touched her nose. Her hands were full of warm blood. Fei Cui immediately screamed: \u201cYou! You dare to hit me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it? The one I hit is you, this darn thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei raised her eyes and rolled her wrists.</p><br/><p>\u201cThing that doesn\u2019t have eyes. Actually dare to bully our miss. Beating you is already light!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ah, ah, ah! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>When had Fei Cui suffered like this? Seeing the maid around Murong Qi Qi being so \u2018arrogant\u2019, fire pounced in her head. With her head bowed, she rushed directly at Su Mei\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Fei Cui to touch Su Mei, Su Yue at one side stuck out her foot, hit Fei Cui\u2019s chest and directly sent Fei Cui flying out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Peng\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know if it was Su Yue who did it intentionally or if it\u2019s Fei Cui who was unlucky, but when she fell, her head hid the back of the rockery. She immediately felt dizzy. She touched again. Her hand was full of blood. Fei Cui cried and screamed: \u201cIncredible, killing people, ah! Come quickly. Ah! Third miss wants to kill someone, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of Fei Cui\u2019s loud voice, not a moment had passed before it attracted a group of people watching. When Murong Xin Lian heard the news, she also hurried over.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui, what happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw Fei Cui\u2019s swollen cheeks and the face full of bloodstains, Murong Xin Lian almost didn\u2019t recognize her. If it wasn\u2019t because she saw Fei Cui\u2019s clothes, Murong Xin Lian wouldn\u2019t have thought that this person with the pig face was actually Fei Cui!</p><br/><p>\u201cWoo woo woo, second miss, you must seek justice for this slave, ah! This slave came with second miss\u2019s invitation to invite third miss, but third miss didn\u2019t even say something and let them beat this slave. This slave came with good intentions but has been beaten like this. Third miss also said that she wants to kill me. Second miss must save me, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui was a person who\u2019s good at reversing the black and the white. Today, she had suffered at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s, no matter what, she couldn\u2019t swallow this anger. Fortunately, Murong Xin Lian was now here, she might as well make the matter big. After all, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reputation was already very bad, a bit more wouldn\u2019t do it much harm.</p><br/><p>Hearing Fei Cui\u2019s words, Murong Xin Lian was full of doubts. Hadn\u2019t Murong Qi Qi always been weak and incompetent? When had her gut turned so big?</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t look as though Fei Cui was lying and the wound on her face was truly there. It really existed. It seemed that something must have happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird little sister, is what Fei Cui said the truth? Was it really you who hit her? It was I who had told her to come invite you to admire the moon tonight. Even if you didn\u2019t want to go, there\u2019s no need to vent on a maid, ah! What did Fei Cui do so wrong that you had used such a ruthless hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s reputation in Murong fu1 had always been very good. She was beautiful and more approachable than Murong Qing Lian. She didn\u2019t have the arrogance of a miss, so everyone in the fu really liked this second miss.</p><br/><p>At this time, hearing Murong Xin Lian say that Murong Qi Qi had hit Fei Cui without any reason, everyone began to whisper. The things they whispered about were all about how bad third miss was.</p><br/><p>She was indeed the goddess of pretending, ah! Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but clap in her heart. It seemed that Murong Xin Lian was really popular in the fu. Everyone was speaking up for Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister, the matter is not like that\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi opened her mouth and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Fei Cui who said that I am a rubbish and that I didn\u2019t even deserve to admire the moon with second big sister. She also said that I\u2019m an ugly duckling, second big sister is the white swan. I don\u2019t even deserve to clean second big sister\u2019s shoes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words left her mouth, Murong Xin Lian froze. She knew very well what kind of person Fei Cui was. These words being said by Fei Cui was somewhat believable. After all, she usually said the same in front of Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe also forced me to give the position of Jing wangfei2 to second big sister. She said that only a beauty like second big sister is worthy to be standing by Jing wang\u2019s side. She also said that you are a match made from heaven, a perfect match. And I am just a rubbish who can\u2019t practice martial arts. I should just disappear early to not hinder your road\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi sobbed. Her small shoulders shrugged. Coupled with that pair of watery eyes, she seemed particularly delicate and pitiful. The people who\u2019d just now denounced Murong Qi Qi, after hearing that, the way they looked at Murong Xin Lian and Fei cui began to change.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking that second big sister is usually such a good person, how can such this slave have been taught by you? This is simply a discredit to second big sister reputation. So I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said a few words to her. But then she slapped herself two times and also slammed her head against the stone. Later, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense! The one who hit me is obviously her! Don\u2019t believe her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ability to turn the truth around was even better than hers, Fei Cui became anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the slap on my face was done by me, how could the fingerprints be like this?! Don\u2019t listen to this rubbish\u2019s nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Fu: residence/household </p><br/><p>2. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

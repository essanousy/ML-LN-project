She, more or less, had an understanding of it. So she cannot let the other party find a thorn in her etiquette!</p><br/><p>\u201cEn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s etiquette was at its place. The gestures were generous without losing nobility. Dongfang Lan couldn\u2019t pick any faults. Therefore, she nodded slightly so as to show her satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a child who knows etiquette. You\u2019ve been trained well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking empress dowager!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she couldn\u2019t pick out any faults, but this didn\u2019t mean that Dongfang Lan would let Murong Qi Qi off. However, she\u2019s an empress dowager. If she really made matters difficult for Murong Qi Qi, not only would she offend Xi Qi, but also let people make a controversy of it and say she is small-minded. Fortunately, she prepared earlier. That\u2019s why she brought along these two beauties.</p><br/><p>Among these two beauties, Murong Qi Qi has seen one. It\u2019s Wanyan Bao Zhu, Bei Zhou\u2019s princess and Bei Zhou\u2019s flower. The other is the prime minister\u2019s granddaughter. People call her the most talented woman of Bei Zhou, Mu Yu Die.</p><br/><p>The two both have good feelings towards Feng Cang. Mu Yu Die was twenty years old and hadn\u2019t married yet. She was bent on waiting for Feng Cang. Since Dongfang Lan brought them here, it\u2019s apparent that she didn\u2019t want to make Murong Qi Qi look good.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that princess came from a scholarly family. Don\u2019t know what kind of books princess usually reads?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one asking is Mu Yu Die. She has a white face, dignified features. Her body has a scholarly aura. Plus, the fact that she was wearing white, she looked like an orchid on a mountain stream. Very elegant.</p><br/><p>However, relying on the fact that her grandfather is the prime minister, Mu Yu Die\u2019s eyes has a hint of harsh aristocratic pride, ruining her overall beauty and making it her flaw.</p><br/><p>The other party was acting so aggressive in front of so many people. The empress dowager must\u2019ve given her permission. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know which rumors about her these people know. But in a situation where she doesn\u2019t know the other party\u2019s bottom line, going head to head isn\u2019t a good idea.</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi answered somewhat \u2018cowardly\u2019: \u201cWoman with no talent is virtuous. I only know a few words.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words fell, there was laughter. The one who laughed is none other than Mu Yu Die. She had long heard that this Murong Qi Qi was a rubbish of ignorance. Originally, she wanted to embarrass her today; let her become a fool in public. She didn\u2019t expect that she (MQQ) would admit it all on her own.</p><br/><p>Know only a few words? Then, doesn\u2019t this mean that she is no different from farmers?! How can such a person be worthy of Feng Cang? She is not even worthy to clean Feng Cang\u2019s shoes!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, does this lady feel that what I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the sarcasm in the other party\u2019s eyes, Murong Qi Qi acted as if she didn\u2019t understand. Her eyes were clear and her smile was like rainbow. It\u2019s so clean, it\u2019s refreshing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore the departure, my mother repeatedly told me that women without talent were virtuous. Instead of reading those poetry and literature, it\u2019s better to learn how to manage the house, how to be a qualified wife and how to obey the husband and teach the children. After marrying, obey the husband. Only husband is my sky. Should listen to husband in every way. Can it be that you think this isn\u2019t right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Dongfang Lan feel very comfortable. Three obeys and four virtues are the essential qualities of a woman. Of course, women must see their husband as the sky. Why does she need to understand so much? It\u2019s more practical and reliable to be good to the husband and teach the children! It seemed that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mother isn\u2019t a befuddled person and taught her well.</p><br/><p>Three obeys and four virtues: Confucian moral injunctions for woman. Obey three men: father, husband and son. Plus, they need to have four virtues: morality, physical charm, proper in speech and efficiency in needlework.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s very strange. When Dongfang Lan was young, she was a sloppy woman. She was not bound by etiquette. But now that she is old, she began to put importance on these and also asked the same from others. That\u2019s why she was quite satisfied with Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words. It could be considered that she passed on the virtues.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said! Indeed, needs to be like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan nodded. Seeing Murong Qi Qi standing well-behaved there; her facial features are very common without a fox beauty, the dissatisfaction in Dongfang Lan\u2019s heart calmed a bit.</p><br/><p>Her looks are ordinary. She looked like she knew her place well. These are alright. If she wasn\u2019t Murong Tai\u2019s daughter, she might have nodded at this marriage.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang felt somewhat surprised with Murong Qi Qi\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>With his understanding of Murong Qi Qi, she wasn\u2019t simply as someone who only knew a few words\u2026\u2026Looking at her again, Murong Qi Qi looked humble and full of humility. Feng Cang almost laughed out loud. He was worried that she wouldn\u2019t pass, how could he forget that his little wangfei1 is someone who eats people?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that Mu Yu Die provoking Murong Qi Qi at such an occasion made him very unhappy.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he needs to go have a hearty talk with prime minister Mu. A woman staying at home at such an old age, she might have forgotten the etiquette. It\u2019s time to find a husband for her!</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s appreciation made Mu Yu Die\u2019s heart alarmed. She was thinking of poetry and wanted to show off her talents, but she had forgotten that empress dowager was most compliant with these \u2018traditional virtues\u2019.</p><br/><p>No wonder, the empress dowager knew that sh liked Feng Cang, but she never nodded. Could it be that this was the reason? Before, she was thinking of how to show off her literary grace and definitely suppress Murong Qi Qi. She didn\u2019t expect that she moved a stone to stub her own feet! It seemed that she needs to hide her talent and be respectful. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be able to enter Nan Lin wangfu2 in this life, not to mention to be together with Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>Moved a stone to stub her own feet: make a move which turned bad for oneself</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was very happy seeing Mu Yu Die suffer defeat.</p><br/><p>Everyone in Yanjing capital knew that she and Mu Yu Die were competitors. Both liked Feng Cang. Although she\u2019s a princess, but Mu Yu Die was always on top of her because of her virtues and talents. This made Wanyan Bao Zhu very unhappy. She bore with it for a long time. Now she finally saw Mu Yu Die become embarrassed. Naturally, Wanyan Bao Zhu was happy.</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die was tactfully retorted by Murong Qi Qi, so Wanyan Bao Zhu came up with another question. She isn\u2019t mindless as Mu Yu Die. These past few days, Wanyan Bao Zhu has been reading information about Murong Qi Qi. She thought for a long time before coming up with this question. It will surely embarrass Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be able to break the rule and be bestowed the title of princess, big sister must\u2019ve extraordinary talents. Don\u2019t know which level of martial arts did big sister reach?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial arts. I don\u2019t know martial arts,\u201d Murong Qi Qi answered honestly.</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wanyan Bao Zhu pretended to be surprised and put her hand before her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t have any martial arts? Then, isn\u2019t that a rubbish? Aiya, bengong3 is straightforward, big sister don\u2019t take it too hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang couldn\u2019t help but frown at Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s words. He has never had other ideas just because Murong Qi Qi doesn\u2019t have martial arts. He loves Murong Qi Qi. He loves her for being her and not because of the benefits she can bring him. Those are just added values!</p><br/><p>Love shouldn\u2019t be a bargain and also doesn\u2019t need those added gorgeous adornments.</p><br/><p>Having this person at his side is better than anything! Besides, he is a man. Protecting his wife and children is something he should do. As long as he loves her, even if Murong Qi Qi doesn\u2019t know anything, he wouldn\u2019t mind. He decided that his marriage is not the goddamn business of others!</p><br/><p>Some of the rumors about Murong Qi Qi had long spread to Yanjing. Now that Murong Qi Qi admitted in public that she didn\u2019t know any martial arts, the officials below couldn\u2019t help but begin to murmur.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t have martial arts, doesn\u2019t have literary talent; she doesn\u2019t have anything, but has been promised to Feng Cang. Dongfang Lan was very unsatisfied. Plus, the fact that she saw Feng Cang protectiveness towards Murong Qi Qi and also let her live inside Tingsong Building, the package in her heart was already as big as the sea. She bore with it for a few days just to embarrass Murong Qi Qi today. That\u2019s why Dongfang Lan didn\u2019t stop Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>Since Murong Qi Qi admitted in public that she didn\u2019t have any martial arts, Wanyan Bao Zhu raised her chin proudly.</p><br/><p>She is already a level four martial artist. Soon, she will enter the blue level five. No matter if it\u2019s ability, family background or appearance, no one could be compared to her. Only she is worthy to be next to Feng Cang. As for Murong Qi Qi who doesn\u2019t have anything, she can only be a rubbish to warm the bed. Where is she eligible to be Nan Lin wangfei?!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s provocation is like a child\u2019s grudge in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes. No matter how beautiful this butterfly is, it also needs the flower to be willing to bloom, ah! What\u2019s the meaning of having an unrequited love? It\u2019s simply a journey where an idiot goddess will grow.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s proud face, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s brain moved and thought of a way to make her angry, but it needed Feng Cang\u2019s coordination.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye4, aside from female work, cooking, taking care of the household and a loyal heart, Qi Qi doesn\u2019t know any other thing and also doesn\u2019t have any other thing, will you be dissatisfied with Qi Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t directly answer Wanyan Bao Zhu, instead she looked pale-faced at Feng Cang, acting as if Feng Cang said a \u2018no\u2019, she would be completely disheartened. That delicate and pitiful appearance made people couldn\u2019t help but love!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, how can benwang5 be dissatisfied with you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang immediately showed his attitude. He come to her side and lovingly grabbed her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan it be that Qing Qing forgot about the assassination night? If it wasn\u2019t because of Qing Qing took care of benwang without resting, how would benwang recover so fast?! The whole journey, Qing Qing took care of benwang\u2019s necessities of life. Every day, you did it full of dedication and didn\u2019t slack off for a moment. All of this, benwang took in my eyes and remembers in my heart. How is benwang a superficial person?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Murong Qi Qi listened to this, her whole body got a layer of goose bumps, but her face showed a look of happiness.</p><br/><p>Say she could act, now she feels that Feng Cang can act even more. What is taking care of him without resting? What is taking care of his necessities of life, full of dedication during the whole journey? How come those words, no matter how you listen to them, would make people think they had an affair\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Just a few words from Feng Cang directly put Wanyan Bao Zhu into the category of \u2018superficial\u2019. Hearing that they were so intimate on the journey made Wanyan Bao Zhu so angry that she stomped her feet. She turned and pulled Dongfang Lan\u2019s sleeves.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, see how Cang gege6 is talking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCang er7, what did you just say? Did somebody go to assassinate you? When? Did you get injured?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan didn\u2019t pay attention to the unhappiness of her granddaughter. Now she is most concerned about Feng Cang\u2019s safety. Once she heard that the only blood left by her beloved daughter had encountered an assassination attempt, Dongfang Lan became anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress mother, it\u2019s like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Emperor Wanyan Lie saw that his empress mother got angry, and worried that she would hurt her body from anger, quickly told her what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhen8 already sent people to investigate this matter. Empress mother, be assured. Zhen will definitely find the culprit!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Lie said \u2018culprit\u2019, Murong Qi Qi obviously sensed the coldness in Feng Cang. Could it be that he already knew who the culprit was? Why didn\u2019t he say it in public? Or was there another hidden motive?</p><br/><p>Previously, Murong Qi Qi had looked at some information about Feng Cang. The information said that because Feng Cang was especially liked by Wanyan Lie, he once had the idea of dethroning the crown prince and let Feng Cang become the crown prince instead.</p><br/><p>Although in the end that matter hadn\u2019t succeeded, but the relationship between crown prince Wanyan Hong and Feng Cang became very awkward. It was also said that Wanyan Hong has a deep-rooted hatred towards this Nan Lin wang who took his emperor father\u2019s love. Could this matter be done by the crown prince? But, second prince Wanyan Yi is also a popular contender for the crown prince\u2019s possiton. Maybe he wanted to frame the crown prince\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It seemed that Feng Cang wasn\u2019t as bright as he looked like. Raised in the imperial family and being in such a sensitive position must\u2019ve been really hard on him.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s fingertips gently tapped Feng Cang\u2019s palm to let him not think too much. Sensing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s concern, Feng Cang\u2019s heart felt warm. He squeezed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand to let her not worry, but the words coming out of his mouth were cornier.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s all thank to princess Zhao Yang taking care of me the whole journey. Speaking of it, she is my lucky star. Since the assassination attempt, benwang was safe after going to live in her tent. No other accidents happened after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only now did Dongfang Lan see where the problem lay. Originally, she thought that the two were clear as water. She didn\u2019t think that they had actually lived in the same carriage and tent.</p><br/><p>Now it\u2019s impossible to return Murong Qi Qi or promise her to another. Besides, Feng Cang already has feelings for Murong Qi Qi. If she forcefully breaks them apart, she fears that Feng Cang wouldn\u2019t agree.</p><br/><p>At this point, Dongfang Lan is in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>If she agrees, her heart will be troubled because of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity. If she opposes, then she will get the name of being a betrayer. After all, Murong Qi Qi came to form a marriage alliance. Said it uglier, she came to chongxi for Feng Cang. She can\u2019t go too overboard. This involves the politics of the two countries.</p><br/><p>Chongxi: arrange a wedding for a very ill young man with the hope that the \u2019event of great joy\u2019 will drive away his bad luck and hasten his recovery</p><br/><p>Moreover, something happened to all of the former women sent to Feng Cang. This time, Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang stayed together for so long, but she is unscathed. Maybe her bazi can suppress the killing in Feng Cang\u2019s bazi\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Bazi: eight characters representing the year, month, day and hour of one\u2019s birth. Every one of them has two characters which form eight characters. A bazi is used in fortune telling.</p><br/><p>Could it be that this is fate? Dongfang Lan is not happy and not willing to resign to this fate.</p><br/><p>However, Feng family\u2019s bloodline needs to continue. Feng Cang is already twenty-five. Other men at his age already have sons and daughters. Only Feng Cang, while marrying one, he would curse one, making it now that nobody dares to marry him. Could it be that she really needs to let Murong Qi Qi enter Feng family? Let the future children of Feng family have the enemy\u2019s blood in them?</p><br/><p>In just a moment, Dongfang Lan thought about a lot. The grandson in front of her, is the grandchild she loves the most. This child lost his parents at ten and also suffered from calculations of others which ruined his body. Very hard, he became an adult, but getting a granddaughter-in-law is so difficult\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Looking at Murong Qi Qi again; her skin is ordinary, her ability is ordinary, everything is ordinary. No matter how she looked at it, Murong Qi Qi is not worthy of Feng Cang. But she has entered Feng Cang\u2019s eyes and also nothing happened to her when she stayed beside Feng Cang. Could it be that it\u2019s enemies who will fall in love with each other?</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan hesitated and was silent for a long time. Only when Wanyan Bao Zhu called her, did she come out of a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, princess said you have a loyal heart. Did aijia9?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan looked at Murong Qi Qi with sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen aijia asks you, are you now Xi Qi\u2019s citizen or are you Bei Zhou\u2019s citizen? If there\u2019s conflict between the two countries, on which side will you stand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s words were very aggressive. Everyone could see that shes making things difficult for Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering empress dowager, no matter if it\u2019s Xi Qi or Bei Zhou, they have nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s magnanimous answer made people breath out loudly. Have nothing to do with her? What does this mean? Dongfang Lan frowned, but unexpectedly, Murong Qi Qi has more to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only stand by wangye\u2019s side. What wangye choose, I\u2019ll choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>A perfect answer, throwing the ball at Feng Cang. Now Feng Cang couldn\u2019t help but love this little woman more! She knows how to stand in the shade of the big tree and throw all the problems to him, let him face them. Does this woman believe in him or does she only find them too troubling?</p><br/><p>\u201cEn,\u201d Dongfang Lan nodded. No matter if Murong Qi Qi answered Xi Qi or Bei Zhou, she will leave something for people to use against her. Only answering like this is the best. It seems that she isn\u2019t so stupid after all.</p><br/><p>If her heart is really thinking like that and sees Feng Cang as the sky, then Dongfang Lan will be at ease. It\u2019s just that she (DL) doesn\u2019t know if her (MQQ) mouth is saying something, but her heart is thinking otherwise.</p><br/><p>She is not a stubborn old lady. She spent one day to get to know about Murong Qi Qi. She (MQQ) is also a pitiful child! It\u2019s just that no matter what, Murong Qi Qi is Murong Tai\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s also a fact that Feng Xie was defeated at Murong Tai\u2019s hands!</p><br/><p>For so many years, Dongfang Lan often dreamed about Wanyan Ming Yue. Dreaming about her with Feng Xie carrying their child while standing full of blood in front of her and saying: \u201cEmpress mother needs to get revenge for Ming Yue! Needs to get revenge for Ming Yue!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

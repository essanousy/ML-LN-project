Everything about her is better than Murong Qi Qi, but her humble origin is a thorn inserted deep in her heart. Moving slightly, the pain would make her unable to breath, really uncomfortable!</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister could it be that you are jealous of third big sister?! I heard that you really admire Jing wangye1, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian grinned with a face full of innocence.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a pity, ah! Jing wangye and third big sister already have an arranged marriage. This is probably the so called fools have fool\u2019s luck! Second big sister, you and I don\u2019t have that life. We might as well take the time to upgrade ourselves and become the champion at the competition between the four countries. Maybe you will then get an ideal husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian had an innocent face, but every word coming out of her mouth was like a thorn. These words seemed like they were consoling Murong Xin Lian, but actually they were fanning the fire. They only lacked oil to put on the fire.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the women from great families were not easy to deal with!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi continued to put an innocent expression and did as if she didn\u2019t understand Murong Qing Lian\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Being stimulated like that by Murong Qing Lian, Murong Xin Lian\u2019s resentment was like a snowball; the more you roll it, the bigger it got. She also knew that Murong Qing Lian was waiting for her to make a joke of herself, but what the other party has said was the truth. The future Jing wangfei2 was standing in front of her. This was something that no matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t ignore.</p><br/><p>But even though her heart was uncomfortable, she couldn\u2019t afford to lose to Murong Qing Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way fourth little sister speaks is really interesting. Jing wang is good at everything. The feelings I have for him is like worshipping a hero! Third little sister have such blessing is her good fortune, isn\u2019t that right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u2026,\u201d Murong Qing Lian chuckled loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister, if you really like Jing wangye, you might as beg third big sister to let her speak good things of you and make Jing wang take you in. Although a cefei3 couldn\u2019t be compared to a main wife, but it was still more decent than a concubine. Little sister\u2019s planning wholeheartedly for you, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>While bullying Murong Qi Qi, these two sisters were one mind, but privately these two people were not satisfied with each other.</p><br/><p>The reason was very simple. Although Murong Tai had seven concubines, but the ones he pampered the most were these two\u2019s mothers and that was why they were born. And their mothers were also rivals of each other. The two\u2019s struggle would of course continue on the next generation.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian saw that Murong Qing Lian was ridiculing her in front of Murong Qi Qi, her expression immediately fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth little sister, what do you mean? Are you bullying me because I\u2019m from the illegitimate line? Don\u2019t forget, you are also from the illegitimate line! Later when you get married, you will also only be a concubine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister don\u2019t have to worry about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to Murong Xin Lian\u2019s words, Murong Qin Lian snorted. She had long hated Murong Xin Lian\u2019s actions. Now she (MXL) was talking words with thorns, Murong Qing Lian was also not easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy said as long as I can get a place in the athletics tournaments, he will find me a good husband. But second big sister, you have trained so hard, but you are still only at the third level. If I were you, I will hide my face in my sleeves in shame and wouldn\u2019t come out to meet with people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian knew that her talent in martial arts was not as high as Murong Qing Lian\u2019s. This was also exactly why when they fought, Murong Tai would be biased towards Murong Qing Lian. Now Murong Qing Lian was obviously humiliating her, how could Murong Xin Lian accept this?</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Xin Lian grit her teeth, Murong Qing Lian was in a good mood. She put her hand on her mouth and snickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, I\u2019ve forgotten, second big sister is now the number one beauty of the capital, how can this face be hidden? You should let people see it more often! Maybe someone will fancy your beauty and directly carry you into a room. Then you can tell daddy about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian had Murong Tai\u2019s love, so she was used to being arrogant. While talking she wouldn\u2019t go easy on people. In contrast, it was Murong Xin Lian who always wanted to protect her \u2018virtuous\u2019 image. Faced with the eloquent Murong Qing Lian, Murong Xin Lian could only face defeat.</p><br/><p>Cool! Really cool! Seeing these two sisters fighting each other, Murong Qi Qi was the happiest person on the scene. What was this called? Cats and dogs! The more they fight, the happier she woudl be!</p><br/><p>They came with the intention to humiliate Murong Qi Qi, but in the end she was humiliated by Murong Qing Lian. How could Murong Xin Lian accept this? No matter what, Murong Qing Lian let her lost face in front of the rubbish Murong Qi Qi. This was something she absolutely couldn\u2019t accept.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse your whip to paint her face!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Murong Xin Lian was really furious, a voice reached her ears. Not waiting for Murong Xin Lian to understand where these words came from, her hands began to move. She raised the whip and whipped Murong Qing Lian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one, who just now was as proud as a peacock, immediately covered her face and screamed. She stared at the whip in Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hand. Her eyes were full of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond bid sister, you actually wanted to ruin my looks? Murong Xin Lian, shame on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qin Lian pulled out a sword and pointed it at Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth little sister, don\u2019t be impulsive, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian like this, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart almost lost breath because of laughing, but she put an anxious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister didn\u2019t do it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of my way! This is none of your business!\u201d</p><br/><p>How would the furious Murong Qing Lian listen to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018persuasion\u2019? The sword in her hand stabbed Murong Xin Lian at her soft spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, be careful, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s maid Fei Cui anxiously warned Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhen Zhu, beat that maid to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian couldn\u2019t take Fei Cui\u2019s expression. She immediately gave her head maid Zhen Zhu an order.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat her fiercely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Receiving miss\u2019s command, Zhen Zhu also didn\u2019t think much, rushed and slapped Fei Cui twice in the face. Her action was fierce and skillful. After a moment, she left five fingerprints on Fei Cui\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to slap me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui was now seeing stars because of Zhen Zhu. She followed Murong Xin Lian and has always been a head maid, when had she been bullied like this? She immediately went into a fight with Zhen Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight anymore! Second big sister, fourth little sister, if you have something to say, talk, don\u2019t fight anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi hid in the corner. From time to time, she would shout. While she was tired from shouting, Su Mei handed her a slice of melon to soothe her throat.</p><br/><p>While Murong Xin Lan\u2019s whip shot out once again, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice once again came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth little sister, your face is bleeding. If you don\u2019t treat it, it\u2019ll leave scars!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hand flicked once again and the whip went to Murong Qing Lian\u2019s face. The whip left a print on both side, very symmetrical.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, second big sister, how can you be so cruel?! Even if you\u2019re jealous of Fourth little sister, you don\u2019t need to be like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi \u2018exclaimed\u2019 in surprise.</p><br/><p>With Murong Qi Qi fanning the flames, Murong Qing Lian\u2019s anger rose. The sword went to Murong Xin Lian\u2019s body mercilessly. A thin hole was left in Murong Xin Lian\u2019s left arm. Finally the sword crossed Murong Xin Lian\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>1.

Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji exchanged a glance. They retreated to one side. Arrows immediately fired at Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>This was bad\u2026\u2026Jin Mo smiled helplessly. He is now regretting very much that he didn\u2019t practice martial arts well. Although his martial arts were not bad, but the thing that he is good at, is the art of healing. Master said that although people need to have skills, but they also need to have the ability to protect themselves. At that time, he didn\u2019t put those words in his heart. Today he understood those words, but it seemed that it was a bit too late.</p><br/><p>Now seeing this dark mass of shiny arrows in front of him, Jin Mo once again looked at Murong Qi Qi, who is looking at this play in the shadows. His heart felt bitter and obscure. Could it be that his legendary reputation would be destroyed at the hand of this little woman Murong Qi Qi? Should he really send out a signal for help? Then wouldn\u2019t it let people laugh till they lose their teeth?!</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuang\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>At this time, an iron umbrella opened in front of Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuang kuang kuang\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The arrows landed on the ground. Jin Mo clearly saw the people who came. Happiness immediately went into his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cJi Xiang, Ru Yi, how come it\u2019s you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWang [Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank] said with mister\u2019s IQ, you will definitely not win wangfei1, so he let us come save you. Wang was right, mister really is wounded!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang eyes are like crescent moon and both sides of his cheeks have a little dimple. Seeing Jin Mo\u2019s blood-red abdomen, Ji Xiang chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is not our wangfei yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo said it with gritted teeth, but in his heart, he couldn\u2019t help but admire that woman who looked ordinary and weak on the outside. Her wisdom was her most powerful weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang said she is wangfei, then she is wangfei. Mister shouldn\u2019t disagree!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ru Yi and Ji Xiang are twins of mixed sex. The two looked alike. When they are laughing, their eyes are like crescent moons. The only difference was that Ru Yi doesn\u2019t have dimples.</p><br/><p>They grabbed Jin Mo at both sides. The three people jumped over the fence and disappeared in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cChase! Chase them faster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Lei was sweating profusely because of anxiousness. Jin Mo appeared in Xi Qi, then what about Feng Cang? Where was he? Could it be that he also came to Xi Qi? But wasn\u2019t the tournament of the four countries still a few months away? This year\u2019s location is Bei Zhou, ah? Why did he come to Xi Qi? There haven\u2019t been any signs, ah!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing\u2019s face color was also not much better. After the people went after Jin Mo, she called Murong Qi Qi alone in a room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you expose his identity before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing looked at Murong Qi Qi sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering empress, the moment your subject\u2019s daughter entered, your subject\u2019s daughter had been seized by him. Your subject\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t know martial arts. I have no means to fight him. Besides empress is here, your subject\u2019s daughter was worried that he will do something bad to empress. That was why I didn\u2019t expose him in the room.\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t look like Murong Qi Qi was lying. Duanmu Qing recalled the scene that had happened earlier. Indeed, it seemed like Murong Qi Qi had been pulled by Jin Mo the moment she had entered. It looked like an intimate act, but after reflecting on it, it did seem strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how did you find out that he is Jin Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing was not an idiot. Although Murong Qi Qi passed this round, but in her heart she still has many questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe empress doesn\u2019t know, according to seniority, Lian gongzi 2 is Jin Mo\u2019s little junior brother. That year when your subject\u2019s daughter was living at Jing Xin An, your subject\u2019s daughter passed some time with Lian gongzi. He has mentioned this senior brother to your subjec\u2019s daughter. Lian gongzi is the disciple of the holy doctor. The two of them practiced under the holy doctor. It was just that Lian gongzi became an apprentice later. At that time, Jin Mo has already mastered the medical skills for many years. So, Jin Mo didn\u2019t know the existence of this little junior brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s explanation, Duanmu Qing seemed to understand the reason. But today\u2019s matter made her very embarrassed. If they\u2019ve killed Jin Mo then it\u2019s alright, but now Jin Mo has escaped!</p><br/><p>Although her being infertile was something that many people know, but after all, there\u2019s no clear proof, so nobody said it on the surface, they also didn\u2019t dare. If this thing was spread out by Jin Mo, with his medical skills, people would certainly believe it. By that time, it was not so simple with only facing a \u2018not able to have children\u2019, the saliva of the women from the harem would be able to drown her, not to mention Longze Yu who already didn\u2019t have any feelings for her.</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Duanmu Qing began to hate Murong Qi Qi. If it wasn\u2019t because she cut Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s tendons, Duanmu Qing will not have forced her to find Lian gongzi and would also not have been taken advantage by Bei Zhou\u2019s Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>Feeling Duanmu Qing\u2019s hatred, Murong Qi Qi quickly took out a small box and raised it with both hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing didn\u2019t take it. She only looked coldly at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands. She didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi with such ordinary looks will have a pair of such beautiful hands. White like jade. Smooth like silk without any flaws. It was like they have been finely carved out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering empress this is Lian gongzi\u2019s \u2018having children\u2019 pill. Your subject daughter\u2019s body is on the cool side, it\u2019s the winter cold, so Lian gongzi aside from the Xue Fu pill also gave your subject\u2019s daughter a \u2018having children\u2019 pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Winter cold? Was it not the same thing that Jin Mo said that she had? It was very hard for people who have winter cold to get pregnant. Duanmu Qing\u2019s mind moved. She took over the box and opened it. Inside, there was a pill as red as blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, your subject\u2019s daughter wanted to save it and use it after the wedding, but\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice choked.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now Jing wang has written a letter of breaking the engagement to your subject\u2019s daughter. Your subject\u2019s daughter will no longer be able to use it, so to present the Buddha with borrowed flowers, your subject\u2019s daughter will give it to empress, hoping that empress will give birth to a crown prince soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>To present the Buddha with borrowed flowers: to win favor using someone else\u2019s property.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing wang has written a letter to break the engagement?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing has already heard of this matter, but she still showed a surprised look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can he? Do you want bengong 3 to persuade him and let him take back the letter of breaking the engagement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi shook her head helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour subject\u2019s daughter has self-knowledge. It\u2019s your subject\u2019s daughter who is not worthy for him. The sooner the marriage is dissolved, the better it will be for both of us. Your subject\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t want to delay Jing wang\u2019s future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s bleak expression fell into Duanmu Qing\u2019s eyes. It let her hard heart have a trace of pity.</p><br/><p>She also has heard some things about Murong Qi Qi and she also knew that just now, Longze Jing Tian wrote a blood letter in front of everyone without any mercy. It was clear that Longze Jing Tian hadn\u2019t set Murong Qi Qi into his eyes. In the end, she is just a pitiful person!</p><br/><p>Thinking about her own experience, Duanmu Qing\u2019s tone became gentler: \u201cGood child! You don\u2019t need to be sad. In this world, there\u2019s always a person who will belong to you. Bengong will accept this \u2018having children\u2019 pill. If it\u2019s really effective, bengong will heavily thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heavily thank? Murong Qi Qi was not so stupid to really believe Duanmu Qing\u2019s words. Her biological sister Murong Xue Lian has bad relations with Duanmu Qing in the palace. If Duanmu Qing didn\u2019t come to harm her, that is already good!</p><br/><p>But even if she knew it clearly in her heart, Murong Qi Qi still showed an uneasy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking the burden from empress is something that your subject\u2019s daughter should do. Empress saying that will make your subject\u2019s daughter embarrassed. Your subject\u2019s daughter wish that empress will give birth to a crown prince for my Xi Qi as soon as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer a famous unmarried man</p><br/><p>3. Bengong: this palace, I used by the females of the imperial family</p><br/>\n</div>"}

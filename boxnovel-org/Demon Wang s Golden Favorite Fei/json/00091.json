Su Mei looked up. It turned out to be Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk. Xi Qi\u2019s people are very bold; daring to teach this highness\u2019s person on Bei Zhou\u2019s territory. Very great, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>On Wanyan Kang\u2019s mouth hung a naughty smile, but his gaze swept sharply over Murong Qing Lian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know who gave you the right to beat this person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s appearance was outside Su Mei\u2019s expectations, but it was inside Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expectations. Seeing Wanyan Kang being \u2018a knight saving the beauty\u2019, Murong Qi Qi remained silent and continued to bandage Bai Yi Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she not my third big sister\u2019s maid? As long as she came from my Murong fu1, I can beat her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian gritted her teeth. Her right hand wanted to be free from Wanyan Kang\u2019s \u2018shackles\u2019. However, unexpectedly, the other party\u2019s strength was great. It almost crushed her bones.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian like this, Wanyan Kang sneered. He threw her hand away, making Murong Qing Lian fall onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, why does Murong fu have such a woman without brains? Is she really your sister who came from the same mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s born by a concubine. Originally, concubine Liu was a maid at my mother\u2019s side in charge of the rough work\u2026\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi answered Wanyan Kang very cooperatively.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang made an expression as if he had suddenly realized something.</p><br/><p>\u201cBorn by a concubine? No wonder she doesn\u2019t have any manners! Seeing cousin-in-law\u2019s every gesture, that\u2019s what a model of ladies should be like. This highness thought that every miss of Murong fu was like that. Ah, in the end, she came from a concubine. The person is already ugly, I didn\u2019t expect the brain also to be filled with poop. The true master hasn\u2019t spoken yet, but a little silly girl by a servant pretended to be the lady. Really don\u2019t know what kind of teaching that is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only now did Murong Qi Qi truly gain an insight on Wanyan Kang\u2019s \u2018viciousness\u2019. Although, she had a poisonous tongue, but she needed to take many things into consideration and also needed to maintain her image. So, she couldn\u2019t be unrestrained like him. This Wanyan Kang is really funny! How come there\u2019s such a weird prince in Bei Zhou\u2019s imperial family!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian was so angry that her teeth grinded against each other and made \u2018keke\u2019 sounds.</p><br/><p>Because of her outstanding ability, she got Murong Tai\u2019s favors at Murong fu. The servants also saw the wind and set the helm. They saw that she got the prime minister\u2019s love, so they all respected her. Never did they treat her differently because she\u2019s from the illegitimate line. Instead, it was Murong Qi Qi, the legitimate miss, who was bullied at the fu. Over time, Murong Qing Lian gradually forgot her origin.</p><br/><p>Saw the wind and set the helm: to act pragmatically</p><br/><p>Now, Wanyan Kang repeatedly saying \u2018born by a concubine\u2019, \u2018illegitimate\u2019, \u2018a little silly girl by a servant\u2019, made her feel embarrassed like never before. Her face also changed from red to pale, from pale to black. In front of this prince from another country, her pride was trampled on by his foot. Especially, that \u2018ugly\u2019, made Murong Qing Lian so angry that tears rolled in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Two number one beauties of the capital came from Murong family. Now, she had been nicknamed \u2018little beauty\u2019. How come, she became \u2018ugly\u2019 from Wanyan Kang\u2019s point of view?!</p><br/><p>Hearing Wanyan Kang say that Murong Qing Lian was an \u2018ugly\u2019 thing, Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but think back to the first time she had met him. At that time, he had also called her \u2018ugly thing\u2019 and pushed her away. This prince truly relied on his identity of being a member of the imperial family to do whatever he pleases, ah! However, such a personality is not bad!</p><br/><p>Seeing the smile on Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qing Lian truly got angry. Wanyan Kang was the fifth prince of Bei Zhou, she couldn\u2019t afford to offend him. However, Murong Qi Qi, who she had been bullying for so many years; now, being laughed at by this rubbish, Murong Qing Lian had no way of accepting it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird big sister, there\u2019s an outsider who is bullying your little sister like this, don\u2019t you need to help? After all, I was born by the same father. He\u2019s talking like this about Murong family\u2019s daughters, could he not also be talking about third big sister, you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian pointed the gun at her, Murong Qi Qi only smiled. She stuffed the New Lotus in Bai Yi Yue\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Yue, take this medicine. It\u2019s inevitable that in the tournament, there will be bumps and scratches. It\u2019s not good for a girl to leave scars! If you used all, let people come get more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue was very touched by Murong Qi Qi\u2019s treatment.</p><br/><p>Now, their relationship was obviously that of competitors. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t care about that and also gave her such a valuable medicine. Immediately, Bai Yi Yue bowed at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking princess! Like princess said, knives have no eyes. Princess also needs to be careful! When princess and Nan Lin wang2 marries, we, Bai fu, will certainly send a big gift to repay princess\u2019s kindness of today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Yue, you saying it like that, is like you don\u2019t take me as friend! Good friends don\u2019t need to be like that! When I was being bullied, Yi Yue didn\u2019t look down on me because I\u2019m a rubbish. You didn\u2019t look at me with different eyes. This is already very rare. Between you and me, there\u2019s no need to be so courteous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi simply ignored her and also treated Bai Yi Yue, who isn\u2019t even her real sister, so well, Murong Qing Lian got furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, how come your elbow turns the wrong way?! I\u2019m your real little sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elbow turns the wrong way: favor an outsider instead of someone on one\u2019s own side.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi turned and snapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong3 took into consideration that you\u2019re bengong\u2019s illegitimate sister. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t pursue the matter of you being disrespectful. Today, you\u2019ve slandered me like this. If it wasn\u2019t because your surname is still Murong, bengong would\u2019ve long not been so polite towards you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qing Lian, listen well. From the point of view of relationship, bengong is your legitimate elder sister. There\u2019s order between seniority, there\u2019s difference between legitimate and illegitimate! You\u2019re just an illegitimate daughter born by a concubine. Talking to me like this is already disrespectful. From the point of view of the law, bengong is princess Zhao Yang personally bestowed by the emperor. In front of bengong, you didn\u2019t use the honorific terms, also pointed your fingers at bengong and scolded bengong; all of these actions are very disrespectful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong took into consideration that you\u2019re young and didn\u2019t bother about it. If you continue to take advantage of that and me giving you face; then if you don\u2019t want face, bengong doesn\u2019t have such a little sister like you! As for those words fifth highness said just now, bengong felt that the lesson was well taught. You should listen well and remember them very well. Don\u2019t go outside the country and let Murong family lose face. Here\u2019s Bei Zhou. There\u2019s no one who will protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice revealed a killing intent. The eyes looking at Murong Qing Lian were also cold. Looking at Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qing Lian suddenly shuddered. When did she begin to have such an aura? Since when did this rubbish dare to use such a tone to speak?</p><br/><p>Looking at Wanyan Kang and Su Mei\u2019s eyes once again, Murong Qing Lian immediately understood. No wonder this pair of master and servant dared to be so bold. The master seduced Nan Lin wang; the servant tempted the prince\u2019s heart. Behind them, there are people. No wonder they were so full of confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, you have capability. Are you not only relying on Feng Cang\u2019s love? You\u2019re nothing but a lowly thing who seduces men. Even the maid at your side is very coquettish. She even hooked on a prince\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qing Lian to finish, a slap fell on her face very hard. The slap was so hard, it made Murong Qing Lian\u2019s head buzz and made her eyes see only stars.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian opened her mouth. A tooth tainted with red blood was spat out. She raised her head. The one who slapped her was actually Longze Jing Tian. At this time, Longze Jing Tian was clenching his fists and glaring at her fiercely. That gaze looked like it wanted to kill her, making Murong Qing Lian freeze on spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s our contestant who was disrespectful. Asking fifth prince and princess Zhao Yang not to get angry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian bowed at Wanyan Kang and Murong Qi Qi. Him taking action and slapping Murong Qing Lian was because he couldn\u2019t stand Murong Qing Lian slandering Murong Qi Qi like this; secondly, he was also saving Murong Qing Lian.</p><br/><p>Just now, he saw very clearly. If Murong Qing Lian had said one more word, the sword in Wanyan Kang\u2019s hand would\u2019ve definitely cut off her head. Although Murong Qing Lian indeed went overboard, but now it\u2019s the critical period of the tournament. If they killed Murong Qing Lian now, then the strength of Xi Qi would decline.</p><br/><p>This pagoda that drove away evil spirits was very strange. They didn\u2019t know what was above yet. One more person meant one more helper and also one more chance. So, no matter how Murong Qing Lian acted, Longze Jing Tian would protect her.</p><br/><p>After all, this time\u2019s tournament of the four countries was very important to Longze Jing Tian. Although the voices wanting him to become crown prince of Xi Qi were the highest, but as long as Longze Yu didn\u2019t appoint a crown prince, then his heart wouldn\u2019t be at ease. So, he must further improve his reputation, making Longze Yu couldn\u2019t help but \u2018comply with the public opinion\u2019 and pass the throne to him! Only when he\u2019s at the highest place, having the empire in his grip, could he get what he wants. For example\u2026\u2026the beauty in his heart!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Murong Qi Qi not know Longze Jing Tian\u2019s thoughts. He\u2019s advancing by retreating. It looked like he punished Murong Qing Lian, but in fact he had saved her life and retained the strength of Xi Qi. Have to say, this Jing wang is not an easy person to deal with!</p><br/><p>Advancing by retreating: compromising</p><br/><p>\u201cCount it as if you were lucky. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was too lazy to continue bother with these things. She stepped on the stone stairs to the second floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why benwang4 slapped you?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the others left, Longze Jing Tian turned and looked sternly at Murong Qing Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsking your highness to explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The previously proud Murong Qing Lian was now with her head down humbly. She swallowed all the blood in her mouth into her stomach.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenwang needs to get the first place. Otherwise, benwang would\u2019ve let them killed you and wouldn\u2019t have saved you. Benwang thinks highly of you. Don\u2019t let benwang be disappointed. By then, don\u2019t end up with the head separated from the body\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian heard the threat in Longze Jing Tian\u2019s voice very well. She also knew that just now, Wanyan Kang had the intention to kill her. If she had continued to speak, today, she would\u2019ve definitely died here. Moreover, even if she had died, no one would\u2019ve held Wanyan Kang responsible. Then, she could only be a ghost, full of vengeance.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just, she was now being taught a lesson in public by Longze Jing Tian. Even if they got the first place, the face she lost wouldn\u2019t come back because of that. Murong Qi Qi is to blame for all of this! All of this were the good things that bitch Murong Qi Qi did!</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking wangye! Your subject\u2019s daughter will put in my utmost effort!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s figure disappear up the stairs, Murong Qing Lian gritted her teeth. She picked up the fallen tooth and hid it close against her body. Murong Qi Qi, you and I can\u2019t exist together!</p><br/><p>The second floor was very quiet. There were no people nor any sounds. The stairs to the third floor was located on the other side. At the top, in the middle, a glowing pearl was placed. It was very bright, making this floor very clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anybody here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi carefully looked around once. Here, there wasn\u2019t even a place for people to hide. Could the second level be so simple?</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, young master Helan, what you said is strange. Could it be that we\u2019re not anybody?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang laughed and it was Helan Lian Yi who had a face full of embarrassment after hearing those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. What I meant was that no one is hiding in this place. Don\u2019t know if there are any traps or hidden weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>After experiencing the attack of Dong Lu\u2019s people on the first floor, Bei Zhou still had four people. Xi Qi also still had four people. Three people of Nan Feng had died. Now, they also had four people. Along with the six people of Dong Lu who begged for mercy before, the second floor of this pagoda had a total of eighteen people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether or not there are traps or hidden weapons, won\u2019t we know if we try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian pushed forward an unlucky Dong Lu person who was standing in the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The miserable voice didn\u2019t completely finish speaking, as the whole body had already been divided into tens of pieces and fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue closed her eyes and couldn\u2019t bear to watch such a scene. The others were truly stunned.</p><br/><p>In the air, one after another golden threads appeared in front of everyone because they were now stained with blood. Wanyan Kang wanted to reach out and touch them, but has been stopped by Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. These are golden silk threads. Don\u2019t touch them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden silk threads!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi said that, everyone was stunned again.</p><br/><p>Golden silk thread, as the name suggest, was silk spat out by the golden silkworm. The silk was as sharp as blade. Fire couldn\u2019t burn the silk, sword couldn\u2019t cut the silk. It\u2019s very tough and also extremely sharp. That person of just now, was split into meat pieces because of these gold silk threads.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo shameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Duo began to scold with his peculiar voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Lu is truly too despicable. This time, they actually used such lowly means! Too shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scolding wouldn\u2019t solve the problem. Li Yun Qing squatted on the ground. He looked carefully at those golden silk thread hanging in the air. He shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot able to cross over. The whole second floor is layered with golden silk threads.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Li Yun Qing say that they couldn\u2019t cross over, Helan Lian Yi became anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should we do? If we can\u2019t cross over, then wouldn\u2019t we be trapped in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Murong Qing Lian\u2019s mood was already not good. Now, hearing that, she got very angry. The next moment, she wrapped her soft sword around one of the heads of those Dong Lu\u2019s people.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, who came up with such a bad idea! Why is your Dong Lu so despicable?! What more are there upstairs?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, ah. I really don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/><p>This person shook his head very hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sir Jia Lan who came up with the problem. We only found out after we came in! What more are there upstairs, we truly don\u2019t know, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Qing Lian heard that, she got angry. She wanted to kill this person, but was stopped by Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian glared at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, I already said. No one knows what is upstairs. Leaving them, we can only use them as test subjects. If you kill him, then there will be one less. Could it be that you want to personally go test the top floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi said that, Murong Qing Lian stopped. Indeed, these Dong Lu\u2019 s people were still useful. Thinking till here, Murong Qing Lian retrieved her soft sword. However, her heart still felt unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saying so, could it be that you have a way to cross to the other side? If we can\u2019t cross, then everyone loses!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA way\u2026\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi smirked. \u201cOf course, I have a way! It\u2019s just, why should I tell you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>A breath choked in Murong Qing Lian\u2019s throat. She couldn\u2019t spit it out and also couldn\u2019t swallow it. In the end, she still felt angry but swallowed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t only know how to talk! If you have the ability, then cross over for all of us to see!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi chuckled and didn\u2019t bother anymore with Murong Qing Lian. Instead, she looked carefully at those golden silk threads in the air. The more she looked, the more the smile on her mouth got bigger. Are they not very much like the infrared rays of the future?!</p><br/><p>In the past, she had tried them many times while on training. The most powerful one was when she had stolen the empress\u2019 crown of the Qin palace from the underground treasury of the City Bank. She had passed through three lines of defense. In the end, the alarm didn\u2019t ring.</p><br/><p>Now these, to her, these were just child\u2019s play! It\u2019s just that the infrared rays had been replaced by golden silk threads. If she\u2019s not careful, it wouldn\u2019t be as simple as only being wounded on the surface. She needed to be very careful.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t say a word for half a day, Wanyan Kang couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. He came to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, did you see any tricks to be used? How should we cross over, ah? Could it be that we use qinggong5? However, the roofs are also full of golden silk threads! Moreover, there\u2019s no place around that can be used as a foothold. Even qinggong wouldn\u2019t be easy to use, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHush\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei made a gesture for him to be silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, is my miss not thinking of a way right now?! Could you please not be so noisy?! How come such a big man is acting like a sparrow? Chattering endlessly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, Mei er6, could you not treat me in a more amiable manner?! Just now, I was like a hero saving the beauty, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei! Who wanted that?! This miss could also settle it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMei er, women need to be more gentle! Look at how gentle and pleasant your miss is. You should learn more from her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang leaned towards Su Mei and asked in a low voice: \u201cSay, does cousin-in-law really have a way to cross over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei raised her chin proudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy miss can do anything. In this world, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s difficult for my miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue to brag! Even a feather of a chicken was blown to the sky by you! Not even afraid that if the leather broke, it\u2019ll be embarrassing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Lian couldn\u2019t understand why protective Su Mei is towards Murong Qi Qi and she whispered those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

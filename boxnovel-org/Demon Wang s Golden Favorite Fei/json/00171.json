It was just that he couldn\u2019t accept it. He wasn\u2019t inferior to Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>It was just, no matter how unwilling Misha was in his heart, but it was a fact that he\u2019d lost to Feng Cang today.</p><br/><p>At the mainland, there was still such a deeply hidden skillful person. He had been too careless and made an error in judgement. The pain from his left shoulder stimulated Misha\u2019s brain. The red blood dyed the commoner\u2019s clothes on his body. At this time, Misha was thinking about how to get out of this predicament.</p><br/><p>If he were to meet force with force against Feng Cang, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to win. Feng Cang had so many people. He was at a disadvantage. Not to mention that his legs were disabled and he had also lost his opportunity. Looking at Feng Qi Qi\u2019s expression, she didn\u2019t have the intention of talking and making up with him. If he was caught by Feng Cang, Feng Cang would certainly kill him.</p><br/><p>No matter what, he couldn\u2019t die in such a sorry state today! He still had many things to do. He still hadn\u2019t gotten the person he liked yet\u2026So, he must escape!</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Xue, do you see that river?! Do you still remember how I taught you to breathe in water! In a moment, when I say \u201cRun\u201d, you carry me on your back and jump in the river.\u201d Misha whispered orders in Xia Xue\u2019s ear in a tone that only the two of them could hear.</p><br/><p>One of Xia Xue\u2019s legs was fractured. Now, she could only kneel with one leg on the ground to adjust the pain coming from her ankles.</p><br/><p>At Feng Cang\u2019s side, he had many hands that provided a great strength. At their side, Jia Lan and Jin Yu were captured. Only she and Misha were left. If they met force with force, Feng Cang\u2019s eagle troop wouldn\u2019t be easy to deal with. She and Misha had suffered serious injuries. If they wanted to live, the only way was to use the Red River to escape!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, I get it!\u201d</p><br/><p>After coming to the same point of view with Xia Xue, Misha tried hard to make his state look better.</p><br/><p>He laughingly called out Feng Qi Qi\u2019s name. His voice was soft like a gentle cow\u2019s milk. It was full of temptation, \u201cYi Lian, I didn\u2019t expect that you\u2019re Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Feng Qi Qi! I had searched so long for you but couldn\u2019t find you. Instead, I was first found by you! Tell me, don\u2019t you think this is fate?! Could it be that you don\u2019t want to know why I came here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha looked pale, but it didn\u2019t ruin his handsome face. Even though there was a layer of sweat on his forehead, but he still maintained excellent manners and had an innocent smile, acting as if his left shoulder was intact and he hadn\u2019t suffered any injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no interest in your affairs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, it\u2019s not that you aren\u2019t interested. You\u2019re afraid! You\u2019re afraid of seeing me, because I am the only witness to your past. You don\u2019t want to face the past. You\u2019re afraid to face my affection. You\u2019re afraid that you wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it!\u201d Misha coughed twice. Although his face was very pale, but the smile on his mouth kept expanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Lian, do you know, after killing you, I held you and kept you company for three days and three nights. Originally, I wanted to put you in the crystal coffin. Like that, you would belong to me forever. However, later I discovered something fishy! As\u2026the temperature of your body disappeared, I realized that your soul had left your body. I didn\u2019t want a body without a soul! So, I committed suicide!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPa\u2026,\u201d Mish made a sound of gunshot. His hand pulled out a black thing from his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cGun!\u201d After Feng Qi Qi saw that object in Misha\u2019s hand, she shouted. She immediately moved in front of Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s behaviour let Misha thoroughly understand that she really had fallen in love with this man and that she really didn\u2019t belong to him (M). In the future, there wouldn\u2019t be even a tiny bit of thought about him (M)! Because another man had entered her heart. He didn\u2019t have a chance anymore!</p><br/><p>His heart felt very sore. Misha felt the twitching pain of his heart. The kind of pain that would make one unable to breathe. The feeling was actually so uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Even in the past life, after he\u2019d killed Yi Lian, he wasn\u2019t hurt as much. Because the Yi Lian of that time didn\u2019t have a man around her. Her heart also wasn\u2019t hiding someone else. So, whether it was her body or heart, in the end, it all belonged to him, Lian Sheng\u2019s. Even if the thing he got was her body, but everything till death about her was clean and pure.</p><br/><p>Now, she had put down her life and death to stop the bullet for another man. It could be seen how important this man was in her heart.</p><br/><p>Yi Lian, could it be that you had really never had loved me for a little bit? Even if it was only a little bit? Even a little bit was good\u2026</p><br/><p>Xia Xue obviously felt the slight trembling of Misha on her back. Perhaps, it was because of the loss of too much blood; he must be feeling cold. Perhaps, it was because of Yi Lian, who\u2019s dressed like a man in front of her. The slight sadness emitting from Misha\u2019s body shrouded Misha and let her feel heartache for him.</p><br/><p>Young master, Xia Xue is willing to stay with you for her whole life! Young master, don\u2019t be sad for an unworthy woman, alright?</p><br/><p>These words settled in Xia Xue\u2019s heart for a long time. She had long wanted to say these words to Misha, but she didn\u2019t dare to. Even now, Misha\u2019s sadness let her feel so much pain for him that she wanted to hug and comfort him, but she still couldn\u2019t say those words. Because, she didn\u2019t dare to\u2026She was afraid that if she said it, she would be driven away by Misha.</p><br/><p>This man, no matter if he was asleep or awake, the one he\u2019d kept in mind constantly was Yi Lian. If she wanted to substitute and take Yi Lian\u2019s place, Misha would certainly get angry! So, it was better to stay with him like this. When he needed it, piggyback him like this and do things to the best of her ability. To be able to stay with Misha like this was her happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Lian\u2026,\u201d Misha took a breath and aimed the gun at his head. His smile was bright like the sunshine, \u201cThat time, I ended my life like this! Killing you, I repaid you a life. I thought that you would forgive me now\u2026Yi Lian, do you really not want to give me a chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will never forgive you. Lian Sheng, when you killed adoptive father, we\u2019d already broken all ties. Adoptive father brought me up and treated me like a biological daughter. You\u2019d actually killed adoptive father, who\u2019d worked hard to educate us. I definitely won\u2019t forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>In Feng Qi Qi\u2019s eyes, Misha was a crazy madman. She didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him! However, Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t expect that Misha, this madman, had actually made a gun! If he produced the modern destructive weapon in massive scale, wouldn\u2019t this world be in a mess? No, she couldn\u2019t let Misha, this madman, destroy the world!</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Hearing Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words, Misha laughed till his tears came out. Two rows of clear tears rolled down along Misha\u2019s cheeks, making Misha\u2019s eyes become two deep pools of water.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shua\u2026\u2019 Misha changed his soft appearance of before. He looked malevolently at Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang. His uninjured hand raised the gun and pointed it at Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you hate me so much; since you will never forgive me; since you will never fall in love with me\u2026Then, I don\u2019t mind using the previous way to treat you! Since, you won\u2019t be mine alive, then, I want to let you die in my arms!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha was so crazy. Feng Qi Qi pulled Feng Cang down. Su Mei and Su Yue also got down.</p><br/><p>It was now!</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Misha issued an order. Xia Xue gritted her teeth, dragged her broken foot and ran while carrying Misha to the Red River.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, they want to escape!\u201d Su Mei wanted to pursue Misha urgently, but was stopped by Feng Qi Qi. Whether the gun in Misha\u2019s hand was real or fake, she couldn\u2019t let her people risk themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thump\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xia Xue jumped with Misha into the billowing Red River\u2019s water. The flow of the river was smooth. Soon, they surfaced.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Lian, I won\u2019t let go! I will return!\u201d Misha hugged Xia Xue\u2019s neck and looked at Feng Qi Qi standing on the shore. \u201cYi Lian, you belong to me! I will not give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s words made Feng Cang furious. He didn\u2019t care about those worries of Feng Qi Qi. Feng Cang stood up and reached out, \u201cBring me the bow and arrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Immediately, the eagle troop\u2019s soldiers brought a big bow. Feng Cang jumped on the horse. Travelling along the river, he nearly caught up with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang! Watch out for the weapon in his hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang being like this made Feng Qi Qi anxious. She grabbed a horse and chased after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, they came. What should we do?\u201d Xia Xue swam very hard, but unfortunately, the river was calm. Not a moment later, Feng Cang had almost caught up to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid!\u201d Misha clenched his teeth. His injured left hand clutched Xia Xue tightly. The gun in his right aimed at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026,\u201d Feng Qi Qi, who was chasing after him, screamed. Feng Cang immediately stopped. The slender bow was pulled fully by Feng Cang. The sunlight spread over Feng Cang\u2019s body. His expression was serious. He looked like an immortal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sou\u2026\u2019 The sharp arrow flew straight towards Misha.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the arrow come closer, Xia Xue instinctively blocked in front of Misha.</p><br/><p>\u2018Poo\u2026\u2019 The arrow stabbed into Xia Xue\u2019s right shoulder, making her bite her lip from pain. \u201cBastard!\u201d Seeing that Feng Cang had hurt Xia Xue, Misha was very angry. If the weapon in his hand was real, he certainly would have taken Feng Cang\u2019s life with a bullet.</p><br/><p>At this time, Feng Qi Qi had reached Feng Cang\u2019s side. The situation she was expecting didn\u2019t happen, making Feng Qi Qi feel very surprised. By Misha\u2019s personality, he certainly would have shot Feng Cang and killed him. Why didn\u2019t he do it? Could it be that the weapon was fake?!</p><br/><p>Seeing Misha\u2019s sullen face that was full of hatred, Feng Qi Qi affirmed her thought, \u201cCang, the weapon is fake! Kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it!\u201d Feng Cang pulled the bow twice. Wind blew past his face. The black hair on his forehead swayed. \u201cLaunch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, you go\u2026,\u201d Xia Xue pushed Misha away. She wanted to let him go first, but this time, Misha grabbed her tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t abandon you! You said that you wanted to serve me for life. You\u2019re not allowed to lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s voice just fell, when the sharp arrow was already in front of them. \u201cAh\u2026\u201d Only a scream was heard. The arrow stabbed Misha straight into his left eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master!\u201d Xia Xue screamed when she saw that. \u201cYoung master! Young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Lian\u2026Misha deeply looked at Feng Qi Qi once. In his eyes, there was too much unwillingness!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two sank in the river. The surface of the water was contaminated with red blood.</p><br/><p>They waited for a long time, but no one came to the surface. Feng Cang put down the bow in his hand. The eagle troop also came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, take a thousand people and search along the riverside! I need to see the body if he\u2019s alive. See the corpse if he\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The miserable state of Misha and the unwillingness in his eyes made Feng Qi Qi silent for a long time. Only when Feng Cang came over and held her did she recover, \u201cQing Qing, I\u2019m sorry! Originally, I could\u2019ve taken his life. I didn\u2019t think I would miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words held a deep guilt. Now, he\u2019d only hurt Misha\u2019s eyes. If he could escape this calamity, he would definitely come back and counterattack madly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine! Nothing will happen to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi nestled in Feng Cang\u2019s arms and sighed softly. She hoped that Misha wouldn\u2019t have the chance to turn around his fortune. Otherwise, she didn\u2019t know what would happen in the future.</p><br/><p>When they went back to the ferry crossing, Feng Qi Qi let Su Mei feed Jia Lan and Jin Yu a pill. Then, she let Su Mei untie them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you let us eat?\u201d Jin Yu put his finger in his throat and wanted to throw it up, but that pill had melted the moment it\u2019d entered the mouth. He couldn\u2019t throw it up.</p><br/><p>\u201cFree and Unfettered pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian gongzi\u2019s1 Free and Unfettered pill?\u201d Jia Lan had heard about the Free and Unfettered pill. It was said that the one who took the Free and unfettered pill would need to take an antidote every month. Otherwise, he would slowly begin to decay, starting from the internal organs. Finally, this person would rot into yellow water. Although it was called Free and Unfettered pill, but the meaning was the contrary of its name. Those who took the Free and Unfettered pill won\u2019t have a free and unfettered life anymore. So, this name was a complete irony.</p><br/><p>After mentioning Lian gongzi, Jia Lan suddenly linked him with Yi Lian. The way he looked at Feng Qi Qi began to deepen, \u201cYou\u2019re Yi Lian and Lian gongzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do? I don\u2019t know what kind of grudge is between you and Misha, but you\u2019ve hurt someone from Penglai Island, you\u2019re my enemy! I won\u2019t follow you obediently just because I took a Free and Unfettered pill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan said so much in one go. Feng Qi Qi simply crossed her arms and let Jia Lan finish venting all his discontent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you finished? If you\u2019re finished, look at someone for me!\u201d Feng Qi Qi grabbed Feng Cang\u2019s left hand and put it in front of Jia Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Aren\u2019t your medical skills very high?! What, is there a disease in this world that you can\u2019t cure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking nonsense!\u201d Su Mei put a sword on Jia Lan\u2019s neck. \u201cJust listen to whatever miss say! Talking so much nonsense like a girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being scolded by Su Mei, Jia Lan\u2019s face turned black. He ignored Feng Qi Qi, but was dragged by Su Mei to Feng Qi Qi, \u201cLetting you treat our guye2 is an honor to you! Don\u2019t say that a disciple of Penglai Island doesn\u2019t know how to check a pulse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Jia Lan wanted to be hard-hearted, but he also knew the common saying: a wise man knows better than to fight when the odds are against him. Unwillingly, he put his hand on Feng Cang\u2019s wrist. It didn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t check, but the moment he checked the pulse, Jia Lan suddenly raised his head and looked with surprise at Feng Cang. But, no matter how, he couldn\u2019t see this person\u2019s relationship with Penglai Island.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you get Forget Love? Forget Love is only found at Penglai Island. When did you go to Penglai Island? Or is it that you have a relationship with Penglai Island?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget Love?\u201d This name was very unfamiliar. Everyone looked at Jia Lan. They waited for his explanation, but Jia Lan had to ask for Feng Cang\u2019s past. Forget Love was a knockout drop from Penglai Island. Why did Feng Cang\u2019s body have it? Could it be that he was a disciple of Penglai Island and had a secret mission in the mainland? Why hadn\u2019t he heard of Feng Cang?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mother had this poison in her. Later, when I was in her womb, the poison was passed onto me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang simply explained the origin of this poison.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat relation did your mother have with Penglai Island? Always, it had only been, it had only been\u2026.\u201d Jia Lan swallowed the words he wanted to say. Always, it had only been Penglai\u2019s female disciples who\u2019d married outsiders\u2026Dong Lu\u2019s empress, who had been poisoned with Forget Love. However, Feng Cang is Bei Zhou\u2019s wangye.3 When had he formed a relationship with Dong Lu?</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain clearly, ah! Really making people anxious! To hum and haw, is it that your Penglai Island had done things that are shameful?!\u201d Su Mei got furious at Jia Lan for only partially explaining. The sword in her hand got closer to Jia Lan, \u201cTalk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, put down the sword. You all retreat. Everyone, retreat twenty meters!\u201d Feng Qi Qi ordered Su Mei to put down the sword. Everyone retreated. At the scene, only Jia Lan, Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi were left.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you can tell us. What is Forget Love?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi had an attitude that she wouldn\u2019t give up until she knew the answer. Jia Lan laughed bitterly and told them the secret of Forget Love.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget Love, as the name implies, made people forget their feelings. Penglai Island were on friendly terms with Dong Lu. Always, the empresses of Dong Lu had been Penglai\u2019s female disciples. However, Penglai Island was worried that after the female disciples had married, they would no longer be loyal to Penglai Island and also took preventative measures about the female disciples joining hands with Dong Lu\u2019s emperor and dealing with Penglai Island. So, after they select the female disciple, the masters would give the female disciple who was about to become Dong Lu\u2019s empress \u2018Forget Love\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who took \u2018Forget Love\u2019, if they fall in love, within three years, they would completely forget the person they fell in love with. Ever since then, they would cleanse their heart and limit their desires. They would no longer long for love between man and woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he talked to her, Jia Lan looked once at Feng Cang, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t guess wrongly, the poison on your body is \u2018Forget Love\u2019. Although I don\u2019t know what relationship your mother had with Penglai Island, but I\u2019ve never heard of Forget Love being a fetal poison and passed onto the next generation. If it really could be passed down, then wouldn\u2019t every emperor of Dong Lu have \u2018Forget Love\u2019 in their bodies? This is impossible! Unless, your mother took it during the pregnancy. This is the only justification.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was just, Forget Love is very harmful to a woman\u2019s body. If it was taken during pregnancy, not only will it harm the mother, it would also implicate the fetus. Your mother didn\u2019t love you, so she took Forget Love; or, your mother took Forget Love unknowingly\u2026forgive me for being presumptuous, but who was your mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Wan Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the name Xia Wan Ying from Feng Cang, Jia Lan was very surprised, \u201cXia Wan Ying was Dong Lu\u2019s princess and was betrothed to former Qin\u2019s crown prince, but was robbed by former Qin\u2019s emperor\u2026Then, your maternal grandmother is Penglai Island\u2019s female disciple Jun Lan Mei. This indeed has something to do with Penglai Island. But this is not right, ah! The masters would only give the poison to Dong Lu\u2019s empress. How did Forget Love get taken by a princess? There is no relationship here, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we should ask Dong Lu\u2019s current empress dowager Jun Lan Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words let Jia Lan understand this problem. Before Jun Lan Xin had become the empress, Dong Lu\u2019s empress was Jun Lan Mei. Later, after Jun Lan Mei had died from an illness, Penglai Island had selected Jun Lan Mei\u2019s little sister Jun Lan Xin and sent her over. Could it be that Jun Lan Xin hid Forget Love and later let princess Xia Wan Ying take it? What a mess!</p><br/><p>1. Gongzi: young master</p><br/><p>2.

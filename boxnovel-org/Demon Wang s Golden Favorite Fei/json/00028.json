He didn\u2019t think that Longze Yu would grant her the status of princess and let her marry Bei Zhou country\u2019s Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Thinking about Feng Cang\u2019s deceased father Feng Xie, Murong Tai\u2019s heart tasted bad like it had spilled a bottle of bitter seasoning. From beginning to end, this man has occupied the heart of the woman he deeply loves. Even after his death, she preferred to stay at the temple praying. She refused to take one step outside the temple to take a look at Murong Tai and their two daughters.</p><br/><p>In his heart, Murong Tai isn\u2019t willing to let Murong Qi Qi marry Feng Cang. Although she is rubbish but after all, she is his own flesh and blood.</p><br/><p>His wife Li Qui Shui, throughout her whole life, the only one she thinks of and misses is Feng Cang\u2019s father, Feng Xie. Now, his daughter has to marry Feng Cang to chongxi. No matter how you see it, it\u2019s the Feng family who\u2019s receiving the advantage. This is something that Murong Tai\u2019s pride and dignity as a man could not allow.</p><br/><p>Chongxi: arrange a wedding for a very ill young man with the hope that the \u2019event of great joy\u2019 will drive away his bad luck and hasten his recovery</p><br/><p>But if Murong Qi Qi\u2019s marriage to Feng Cang can return Li Qui Shui\u2019s smile; if sacrificing Murong Qi Qi would make Li Qui Shui step out of the temple she has stayed at for the past fifteen years and come take a look at him, even if it\u2019s only one glance, he will abandon Murong Qi Qi\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>With that thought, just now in front of the emperor, Murong Tai accepted this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that prime minister did not understand bengong\u2019s1 words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi jerked back and looked coldly at Murong Tai. That glance is as cold as ice, making Murong Tai\u2019s whole body suddenly feel chilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong is princess Zhao Yang, the future Nan Lin wangfei2; asking prime minister to please remember your status. The charge of offending your superior is not something prime minister can afford!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuang\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The door slammed as if it\u2019s showing its owner\u2019s anger. Murong Tai looked at the door with a dark face, but because it\u2019s he who pushed Murong Qi Qi into the pit of fire, he suppressed his anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t get angry. Maybe, little sister is too happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian cleverly came to Murong Tai\u2019s side and comforted him in a soft voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. What Xin er3 said is right. She is happy, is happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Murong Xin Lian giving him a way out of an embarrassing moment, Murong Tai returned to normal quickly. But after seeing the traces of a whip on Murong Xin Lian\u2019s face, Murong Tai frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s third little sister who wanted to learn martial arts and let me teach her. It\u2019s daughter who didn\u2019t know how to teach, so, so\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian covered her face. She only said half, the other half she left it to Murong Tai\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! She is just like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>After knowing that the scars on Murong Xin Lian\u2019s face were made by Murong Qi Qi, the guilt that Murong Tai had felt for third daughter decreased.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it\u2019s not a bad thing to have a rubbish married off. Staying at home would take up place and also stir up trouble. Moreover, such a person like Feng Cang marrying a rubbish; in the future, Feng family\u2019s bloodline will have half of his Murong family\u2019s blood. This let Murong Tai feel a small amount of pleasure from revenge.</p><br/><p>Feng Xie, you took away Shui er\u2019s heart. Laofu will let this rubbish scourge the whole Feng clan!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Tai\u2019s mood is excellent. And after seeing Murong Xin Lian look at Longze Jing Tian with a pair of eyes that were full of feelings, Murong Tai\u2019s brain turned and got a good idea. Therefore, he didn\u2019t care that Murong Xin Lian\u2019s looks were currently damaged and took her to Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, this is this prime minister\u2019s second daughter Murong Xin Lian. Xin Lian, quickly pay respect to wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour subject\u2019s daughter greets wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>The handsome man in front of her is the one she\u2019s fancied for a long time, Jing wang. Murong Xin Lian\u2019s little heart suddenly began to thump hard. Her face is also burning really hot.</p><br/><p>Definitely must leave a good impression on Longze Jing Tian. Definitely must use my beauty to keep him!</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lain paid her respect shyly but unexpectedly, the moment her knees bent, the clothes on her body tore open like snowflakes. Even her undergarments turned into patches of red petals flying away. When Murong Xin Lian got up, she was standing without anything on her body in front of Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian turned red from shyness. Her hands immediately covered her chest. After that, she felt that it\u2019s still not right. She immediately turned around and is now facing Longze Jing Tian with her back. But as soon as she turned around, standing in front of her was a eunuch. Murong Xin Lian wanted to die and fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin Lian, Xin Lian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai suddenly shouted, but he didn\u2019t have any intention to step forward and support her.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the red-faced Murong Xin Lian was stiffly falling onto him, Longze Jing Tian felt that no matter if he caught her or not, it wouldn\u2019t be right, so he can only take off his outer garments and quickly wrap it around Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know if Murong Xin Lian really fainted or had pretended to faint. She let Longze Jing Tian shout and didn\u2019t make a sound and continued to nestle in his embrace, making it so that he had no way out of this dilemma.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei and Su Yue exchanged a glance. The two dragged Fei Cui away.</p><br/><p>Only after Murong Tai and the others had left did Murong Qi Qi come out of the room. To her surprise, Murong Jun hadn\u2019t left and was still in Cui Zhu yuan4. The words he said were even more surprising.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird little sister, are you really going to marry Nan Lin wang? His image isn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, the decree has been sent, what can I do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi smiled faintly. This brother\u2019s performance today let her have some admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, thanks big brother for helping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and I are biological siblings, no need to be polite. Moreover, third little sister also helped me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun\u2019s words were right to the point, he didn\u2019t say any more or less.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the offences of the past, asking third little sister to please forgive me. Although I\u2019m playful and unruly, it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t distinguish between the good and the bad. What happened today is what I had to do. Third little sister doesn\u2019t need to put it in your heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>The siblings made eye contact and understood each other\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>Murong Jun stayed for a moment longer and then left. When he reached the door, he suddenly turned: \u201cThird little sister, in the future, if fourth little sister goes overboard and offends you, please spare her.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it turned out that Murong Jun knew that Su Mei did something to Murong Xin Lian\u2019s clothes. Murong Qi Qi only chuckled: \u201cBig brother, my motto has always been \u2018if people don\u2019t bother me, I don\u2019t bother them\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun sighed heavily. Murong Qi Qi said it so straightforwardly; he could only hope that his little sister would behave a little. This third little sister is not as weak as she seemed. He\u2019s afraid that she is the best out of the whole Murong clan\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>In just one night, the wind changed. Murong Qi Qi transformed into an imperial princess &amp; Nan Lin wangfei while Murong Xin Lian has become Jing wang\u2019s cefei5.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I didn\u2019t expect that I ruined her clothes only to have her achieve her dream! But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already let out rumors. Now the whole capital knows that Jing wang broke off the engagement for Murong Xin Lian. They have long had an affair. Murong Xin Lian stole her little sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Now her reputation really stinks. Of course, Longze Jing Tian is also no better! Humph! Who let them bully miss?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Footnotes:</p><br/><p>1. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family?</p><br/><p>2. Wangye/wang: prince of the first rank?</p><br/><p>3.

Murong Qi Qi, as your big siter, today I\u2019ll teach you what sense of shame is!\u201d</p><br/><p>While her mouth is saying that, the whip in Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hand flew mercilessly towards Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face. Seeing the whip getting closer to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s placid face, Murong Xin Lian\u2019s smile became more and more vicious. Mom, today, daughter will kill this rubbish to avenge you!</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>While Murong Xin Lian is dreaming, her face felt pain. A trail of blood under her left eye reached down to the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>What?! The whip actually went around a circle and hit her own face! What\u2019s going on? Murong Xin Lian reached for the burning pain on her face with an astonished expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei covered her mouth and shouted in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, didn\u2019t think you have masochistic tendencies and likes to whip yourself. Could it be that you like S&amp;M (sadomasochism)? Then your future husband will be really happy, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018S&amp;M\u2019? In Murong Qi Qi\u2019s head, an image immediately appeared of Murong Xin Lian tying up Longze Jing Tian like a rice dumpling. A foot on his back and a whip waving in her hand. Her mouth is shouting \u2018call me queen\u2019\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Su Mei being so sarcastic, Murong Xin knows for certain that they have tampered with this whip. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have fallen on her own body.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian once again waved the whip towards Murong Qi Qi. The soft whip is like a snake dancing in the air and heading towards Murong Qi Qi. When the whip is an inch away from Murong Qi Qi, suddenly it\u2019s like it encountered a transparent wall and once again bounced back.</p><br/><p>This time, Murong Xin Lian used more force. The result is also more miserable than before. How much effort she used, all went to her own body. \u2018Pa\u2019, once again sounded. On Murong Xin Lian\u2019s right face appeared a whip scar completely symmetrical to the left cheek. Looking at it, it\u2019s like an upside down \u2018eight\u2019 (?).</p><br/><p>\u201cZeze ze, second big sister, didn\u2019t you always really care about your looks? What stimulus did you receive to so \u2018not want face\u2019?\u201d (a pun for calling MXL shameless)</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018not want face\u2019 finally incensed Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish, you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t want face! The matter of you and Lian gongzi 1 has long spread throughout the capital. I\u2019d like to see how you\u2019ll face people in the future! Why don\u2019t you just die? If you\u2019re afraid to die, I don\u2019t mind giving you a ride!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi held her hand out while laughing. Su Yue immediately rubbed her fingers, which were contaminated with juice, clean with a wet tissue. Then she (SY) carefully wiped a white cream evenly on her (MQQ) hand.</p><br/><p>Su Yue\u2019s action made Murong Xin Lian couldn\u2019t help but compare her to her own maids. With just a comparison, she hated Murong Qi Qi even more. She didn\u2019t expect that the people under this rubbish would treat her so well. What can she do or what does she have to let people serve her like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister, by comparing, it seems that the person who tried to frame her biological brother and sister doesn\u2019t want face more (is even more shameless)! Or should we put up a stall in the capital to let the people of the capital judge who doesn\u2019t want face more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s face became livid.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, everything happened because Murong Qi Qi tampered with them. She (MQQ) has long known her (MXL) plan. So she grafted flowers onto a treeand changed the person into Zheng Min.</p><br/><p>Graft flowers onto a tree: substitute one thing for another.</p><br/><p>Just thinking about the horrifying way Zheng Min died and the series of consequences that it brought along, Murong Xin Lian wanted to tear Murong Qi Qi into pieces and throw her to feed the dogs. Her mother is gone. The image she maintained is gone. Her good destiny is gone. All of this is because of this damn Murong Qi Qi in front of her!</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The furious Murong Xin Lian couldn\u2019t hold it anymore. She waved the whip towards Murong Qi Qi. Now she isn\u2019t as \u2018subtle as before\u2019. She used the inner energy of her body. Her whole body is shrouded in a golden light. This is the symbol of a level three martial artist.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly level three?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi yawned. Su Mei and Su Yue even more didn\u2019t put this into their eyes. Just a small level three and she dared to show arrogance in front of miss? Murong Xin Lian\u2019s head must\u2019ve been struck by lightning!</p><br/><p>In this world, martial arts are split into nine levels. The different colors of the inner energy are to distinguish the levels. Level one to level seven correspond to the colors red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue and purple. Level eight is white. The supreme level nine is black.</p><br/><p>Normally, people will cherish their inner energy and won\u2019t easily show it. Even last time, Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian only fought with their hands and feet. Since the after-effects of using the inner energy is a weak body and they need to rest for a long time before recovering. So, unless it\u2019s a duel or to protect his/her own life, otherwise nobody will use it easily under normal circumstances because that\u2019s simply wasting it.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian apparently knew the truth, but she received deep stimulation and exposed the yellow inner energy to kill Murong Qi Qi. Now in her head, there\u2019s only one thought. That\u2019s to kill Murong Qi Qi to avenge Zheng Min.</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian in golden light revealed a bloodthirsty smile. Although she is less than Murong Qing Lian, but she\u2019s still a level three martial artist. Killing a rubbish, is that not an easy thing to do? Murong Xin Lian is completely immersed in her own thoughts and didn\u2019t see the mockery in Su Mei and Su Yue\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThousand snake dance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s body is shrouded by a dancing whip. This is her ability to kill. Murong Xin Lian is sure, just this one attack will be able to remove Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018dog head\u2019. She is confident in this killer move like how she is confident in her looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cChild\u2019s play\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that poop has entered Murong Xin Lian\u2019s head, Su Mei has already take a long jump. Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to open her mouth, she directly stands in front of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, this slave hasn\u2019t used my muscles and bones for a long time. Can you donubi a favor and reward this opportunity to this slave?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the bright eyes on Su Mei\u2019s oval face are full of playful desire, Murong Qi Qi poked her forehead while smiling: \u201cAlright! Remember, don\u2019t hurt my flower jade-like second big sister\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes miss, this slave will surely take care of her,\u201d Su Mei said while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi \u2018push\u2019 Su Mei forward as the \u2018scapegoat\u2019, Murong Xin Lian smiled viciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to die? This miss will help you accomplish it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian has long thought well of it. If one comes, she\u2019ll kill a pair. If two comes, she\u2019ll kill two pairs. Today, she is determined to take Murong Qi Qi\u2019s head. It\u2019s the best if these two maids are also solved!</p><br/><p>In the air, a snake is dancing. Murong Xin Lian incarnated golden arrows that headed straight to Su Mei\u2019s face. The silver whip immediately turned into a sharp weapon as if it wants to devour this little maid.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei sneered. On that small oval face, the almond eyes sparkled. She stood straight. She doesn\u2019t move even with the wind, as if she doesn\u2019t fear the arrogant Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>Footnotes:</p><br/><p>1.

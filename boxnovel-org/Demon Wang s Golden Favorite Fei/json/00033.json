For a time, the citizens of the whole capital stood at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side without second thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this song really made by Murong Qi Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Longze Jing Tian heard people play \u2018A glance at the mundane world\u2019, he was surprised.

Regretting to so easily gave her freedom\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian\u2019s expression fell into Murong Xin Lian\u2019s eyes making her heart become grimmer. This Murong Qi Qi still hasn\u2019t dispersed!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t need to guess the happening of the outside. It must\u2019ve surely been done by her (MQQ)! What should she (MXL) do? If wangye gets interested in Murong Qi Qi, by then will her position not be affected? Although she wants to kill Murong Qi Qi, but Murong Xin Lian still hasn\u2019t recovered from using her inner energy that time. Using martial arts, won\u2019t be able to do it\u2026\u2026However Murong Xin Lian grew up playing schemes. Just slightly moving her brains, she thought of a way to deal with Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, this song is really made by third little sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lain still maintained her loving and gentle appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, chenqie 3 really wants to invite two little sisters to tour on the lake.

After going on board, Murong Qi Qi met some acquaintances. She nodded at Li Yun Qing, Shangguan Wu Ji and Bai Mu Fei. Murong Qi Qi sat down on a ventilated place</p><br/><p>As Jing wang\u2019s cefei, 4 Murong Xin Lian is dressed very grandiosely. She is Longze Jing Tian\u2019s first consort. Even if it\u2019s only a cefei, but the other princes are still young and hasn\u2019t married. Moreover, Jing wangfu 5 doesn\u2019t have a wangfei6, so Murong Xin Lian\u2019s status can be considered very high. Now she completely looks like the hostess and made the arrangements.</p><br/><p>On the boat the men sat at a side drinking wine. The women sat at the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs miss Bai\u2019s hairpin made by Guang Hua gongzi7? How beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Duanmu Yi Yi saw the lifelike begonia flower, the envy in her eyes became apparent.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it\u2019s like how Murong Qi Qi predicted. Bai Yi Yue really suits such begonia flower.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi smiled at Bai Yi Yue. It\u2019s seems that her taste is very good.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you also know it\u2019s beautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Duanmu Yi Yi saw Murong Qi Qi she thought back about that night her tendons were cut. The eyes looking at Murong Qi Qi are becoming more hostile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you don\u2019t understand anything and is an idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Su Yue behind Murong Qi Qi rushed forward. She raised her hand and gave Duanmu Yi Yi a resounding slap on the face. The boat turned quiet. Everyone looked at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you dare to hit me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi turned frantic. One hand is covering her cheek, the other is pointing at Murong Qi Qi and Su Yue. Her finger is trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one I hit is you,\u201d Su Yue humphed. \u201cMy family\u2019s miss is personally bestowed the title of princess Zhao Yang by the emperor, is Bei Zhou country\u2019s Nan Lin wangfei. If you still dare to speak so presumptuous then it won\u2019t be as simple as just slapping, you!\u201d</p><br/><p>People couldn\u2019t pick thorns from Su Yue\u2019s words. When Duanmu Yi Yi is mocking Murong Qi Qi, her voice was very loud. Everyone on the boat heard it. If Murong Qi Qi really pursue the matter, then the one who will have to take the consequences will be Duanmu Yi Yi.</p><br/><p>But being taught by such a girl, no matter what, Duanmu Yi Yi can\u2019t swallow this anger. She withdrew her sword and wanted to fight, but her ears heard Murong Qi Qi cold and leisurely voice: \u201cCan it be that miss Duanmu is feeling hot and want to go into the lake for a bath?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know why, but this voice made Duanmu Yi Yi shiver. The weather is obviously very hot, why is she feeling so cold?!</p><br/><p>A storm has been resolved by Murong Qi Qi, made Murong Xin Lian feel a bit cold. She immediately stood up and greeted everyone with a smile. But unexpectedly Longze Yu Er at a side opened her mouth gloomily: \u201cPrincess Zhao Yang\u2019s temper is really big. Your maid even dare to hit the empress\u2019s niece!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her relationship with Duanmu Yi Yi has always been good. Since the moment she knows that Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s hand has been hurt, she complained for her. Now she saw that Murong Qi Qi is so arrogant; hitting Duanmu Yi Yi in front of her, Longze Yu Er totally thinks that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t give her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for your praise! Bengong\u2019s 8 people are naturally different!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi did as if she didn\u2019t hear the anger in Longze Yu Er\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Longze Yu Er didn\u2019t expect Murong Qi Qi to have such a thick face.</p><br/><p>\u201cServants, drag this cheap maid out and give her twenty slaps with the wooden stick,\u201d said Longze Yu Er suddenly pointing at Su Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi is still leaning softly on the cushion with one hand propping her chin. She looked pollution free white rabbit and doesn\u2019t seem to be nervous for her maid.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong is unhappy seeing her. She hinders bengong\u2019s eyes, affects bengong\u2019s mood and made bengong lose appetite. You say, do these count as reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Longze Yu Er\u2019s voice fell, a grin appeared on Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s red and swollen face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs still princess who is the best! Still not coming to drag this cheap maid down?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for the people to move, Murong Qi Qi laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cA few days ago, the aunt who came to teach me etiquettes said wangye\u2019s body is not good. If chongxi,9 it\u2019s the best to come in pairs and asked if bengong has a suitable candidate. Today, bengong saw princess Ping Yang and miss Duanmu. I feel one of the two of you are a suitable candidate. Who should I tell wangye to choose? This is really giving me headache\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>1.

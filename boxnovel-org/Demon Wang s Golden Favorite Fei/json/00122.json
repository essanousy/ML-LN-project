The woman he selected was indeed different.</p><br/><p>He saw too many women who were more obsessed than men, with the thrill power brought them. And also to get to that place, they would do anything; harming others and harming themselves. From being simple-minded, they would turn into complex people. From being good-hearted, they would become vicious. He was worried that Murong Qi Qi liked power. He didn\u2019t expect, like Murong Qi Qi, he also thought too much. His woman should of course be a match with him!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow talking about it, it also wouldn\u2019t be good if we don\u2019t have anything and are like commoners, don\u2019t you think so, wangye?!\u201d1 Murong Qi Qi smiled and her bright eyes flashed slyness. \u201cBesides, Wanyan Lie is our enemy. Even if we want to put it down, someone may not be willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue are my parents and their death had something to do with Wanyan Lie; no matter what, I must get revenge for them! Besides, the two of them have the grace for saving your life and also the grace for bringing you up. There is a saying that said, the grace of bringing someone up is greater than the grace of giving birth. On the account of these, we can\u2019t let Wanyan Lie off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words once again coincided with Feng Cang\u2019s thoughts. Feng Cang looked, full of disbelief, at this little woman in front of him. She truly was a gift from the gods to him. She could even guess his mind.</p><br/><p>No matter what his identity is, no matter what happened to Long Yu and Xia Wan Ying; in his memories, those people and things were a blank paper. He could only imagine the stories from what Feng Xie told him. However, Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue were true existences in his life. They gave him unlimited care and infinite warmth. They replaced Long Yu and Xia Wan Ying, gave him the love of a father and mother and let him feel the warmth of a family.</p><br/><p>So, he could let go of restoring the country and let go of revenge, but he couldn\u2019t put down Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s vengeance. Those people who let him lose the warmth of a family he\u2019d gotten with difficulty and who let the woman he loves lose her parents, he wouldn\u2019t let go of even one!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, how could I not love you?!\u201d Before, he\u2019d already loved this woman very much. Now, after getting to know that she\u2019s Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s daughter, he is willing to love her deep to his bones. He is willing to use his whole life to love her!</p><br/><p>Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue were also his parents. They gave him too much, too many things. During helpless times, they were separated like yin and yang. He couldn\u2019t repay the love they gave him. He could only double the repayment on their only daughter Murong Qi Qi. He wanted to let her become the happiest person in this world! To never need to worry about anything!</p><br/><p>Within a day, Bei Zhou\u2019s Yan capital experienced two turbulences.</p><br/><p>The first one was that Murong Qi Qi survived the wedding night, making more than half of the capital lose money.</p><br/><p>When those people were forced to count money to give to the gambling dens and were weeping sorrowfully to the heavens, another explosive news exploded all their grief away\u2026Murong Qi Qi is actually great general Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s daughter and is Feng Cang\u2019s little sister!</p><br/><p>When this news swept the capital, everyone was stunned. If Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity is Feng clan\u2019s daughter, then last night, wouldn\u2019t she and Feng Cang be\u2026oh god, a total mess!</p><br/><p>When everyone\u2019s imagination was running wild and even fantasizing about how hot the scene between a pair of sibling was, someone released news.</p><br/><p>It turned out, that year at Yandang mountain, Li Qiu Shui kidnapped princess Ming Yue\u2019s daughter i.e. Murong Qi Qi. She raised her at the prime minister\u2019s as her own daughter. Her purpose was to take revenge on Wanyan Ming Yue and Feng Xie.</p><br/><p>And before the marriage, the wise Murong Qi Qi learned about Li Qiu Shui\u2019s plan. She, along with her big brother, staged a fake play to lure Li Qiu Shui. In the end, the truth was revealed. In fact, nothing happened between them last night!</p><br/><p>With this \u2018truthful\u2019 news released from the palace, the commoners came to a conclusion. So, it turned out that they\u2019re siblings. No wonder there was no curse. It turned out that they didn\u2019t consummate the marriage. So, once again, the people began to mourn for the money they lost. Tears flooded the whole capital.</p><br/><p>The only one who benefitted from this bet was Guanghua gongzi.2 Although, the other mysterious person\u2019s ten million had also multiplied ten times, but Guanghua gongzi had bet with one hundred thousand golden teals, ah!</p><br/><p>I think the other person bet with silver, while GH bet with gold.</p><br/><p>One hundred thousand golden teals multiplied ten times is one million golden teals! Thinking of one million golden teals, those bosses behind the gambling dens were anxious like ants on a wok pan. What should they do, what should they do? Even if you kill them and sell their meat, they wouldn\u2019t be able to raise one million golden teals, ah!</p><br/><p>In any case, since it\u2019s a gamble, there would be winning and losing. The bosses of the whole street of gambling dens sacrificed everything and scraped five hundred thousand golden teals together.</p><br/><p>Still five hundred thousand golden teals short. Guanghua gongzi sent people to sign an agreement with them. This bet transformed Guanghua gongzi into a part owner of the whole street. Every gambling den needed to hand over thirty percent of their profits to Guanghua gongzi till they paid off the remaining five hundred thousand golden teals. And also the interest during this repayment period was very scary.</p><br/><p>However, whatever the outcome, they still kept their gambling dens and didn\u2019t need to live on the streets. Although those bosses of the gambling den felt that Guanghua gongzi went overboard, but in their heart, they still felt grateful. At least, he didn\u2019t let them close their doors and didn\u2019t break their way of income.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, Wu Qing has already put away the golden teals safely. One part was shipped to the world\u2019s first place of business. Another part was stored as funds.\u201d After Su Mei got these done, she reported everything to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Not bad! First, don\u2019t force them too much. Wait till the right time to swallow them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had recovered from the matter of being siblings. Her mood was very good. After Feng Cang confessed his background to her, he\u2019d hurriedly left. Although he didn\u2019t say anything, but Murong Qi Qi knew he went to quell those rumors.</p><br/><p>After all, yesterday she was still a wangfei.3 Today, she\u2019d become princess Zhen Guo, making people feel incredible. If someone with a hidden motive spread some rumors first, then gossip would be a fearful thing. Feng Cang, as Nan Lin wang, must have his own means to make propaganda. Murong Qi Qi was very assured at letting him go put down the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, are you really Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s daughter? Then, then are guye4 and you not\u2026\u201d Seeing the tranquility on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face, Su Mei could no longer remain calm.</p><br/><p>Ever since Wanyan Lie\u2019s edict had arrived at the wangfu,5 this matter almost made Su Mei faint. In the end, she was able to retain her calmness and deal with the matter of the bet. However, confusion pressed in Su Mei\u2019s heart, making her unable to hold it in any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we what?\u201d Murong Qi Qi put down the things in her hand and looked calmly at Su Mei. The concern for her from this girl, who\u2019d followed her for six years, was real. Her worry was also real. Su Mei and Su Yue were people she trusted. It was just, Feng Cang\u2019s identity was too special. Now, she had to keep it from them.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi so calm, Su Mei was even more sure that Murong Qi Qi had received a big blow. Following Murong Qi Qi for so long, Su Mei knew that the more Murong Qi Qi\u2019s emotions fluctuated, the more calmer she would be on the surface. She must be so sad. That was why on the outside, she looked so serene.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, cry out if you\u2019re sad! There\u2019s me, there\u2019s Su Yue. We will stay by your side. Don\u2019t hold it in your heart and let yourself be sad alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei\u2019s heart ached for such Murong Qi Qi. Although Du Xian Er\u2019s name was very famous, but Su Mei knew Murong Qi Qi was just a simple person. Sometimes, she\u2019s even very childish.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s relationship with Feng Cang was so good. This matter must be a big blow to her! If Murong Qi Qi cried and made a fuss or committed murder and arson, Su Mei would\u2019ve felt that that was normal. However, now she didn\u2019t do anything and was so silent. It was as if nothing had happened. This really was not normal and made people feel surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to finish, Su Mei pulled Murong Qi Qi into her embrace, \u201cMiss, although you\u2019re the miss, but I always saw you as my little sister! Encountering such a thing, miss must feel very sad and feel very painful! Miss, don\u2019t pretend to be strong. Cry out! Pretend that I\u2019m your big sister and cry in my arms!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know whether she should laugh or cry at Su Mei being like this. This silly girl, ah! Hearing in Su Mei\u2019s voice that she was about to cry from anxiousness, Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but let go of Su Mei, \u201cSu Mei, it\u2019s not like what you think. I\u2019m indeed Feng Xie\u2019s biological daughter. This is true. However, it\u2019s also true that I like wangye and wouldn\u2019t give up because of this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said!\u201d A voice came in. Wanyan Kang stood at the door. The moment, he saw Murong Qi Qi, he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ah, ah! Are you cousin-in-law? Are you really cousin-in-law? Are you certainly definitely my cousin-in-law? Why is your appearance completely changed? Could it be that in the past, you wore a human skin mask? Cousin-in-law, this little brother had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai, ah! I actually called you an ugly thing. My eyes must\u2019ve been blocked by gums.\u201d</p><br/><p>Had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai: fail to recognize someone important or someone with great talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come here for?\u201d Miss was already so sad, Wanyan Kang still came to make fun. This made Su Mei\u2019s mood take a turn for the worse, \u201cDid you come to watch a bustling scene?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I really didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei\u2019s unstable mood made Wanyan Kang unable to make heads or tails out of it. \u201cI only heard the matter of cousin-in-law and specifically came here to support cousin-in-law. Although, I know that now, I should call you little cousin sister, but I feel that cousin-in-law is more to my taste\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, no matter who you are, what your identity is, I will support you and cousin brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t finish speaking, when his head suffered a chestnut from Su Mei, \u201cAiyaya, small pepper, what are you doing?! It really hurts, do you know?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho let you talk nonsense, ah! Miss is wangye\u2019s little sister. Siblings being together, do you want my miss to be scolded by everyone?! What kind of brains do you have? How could you let our miss do such a thing?!\u201d The originally locked emotions in Su Mei were now released.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?! As long as they truly love each other, why the need to bother with other people\u2019s views?! Could it be that love shouldn\u2019t break through all obstacles? If everything you do, you need to take other people\u2019s views into consideration, then what meaning does living have?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s words illuminated Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart like a lamp. That\u2019s right, ah! Thinking about it now, those hesitations, indecisiveness and concerns were all a display of not being confident. She, a person who\u2019d time-travelled, couldn\u2019t even compare to Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, thank you!\u201d Murong Qi Qi sincerely thanked Wanyan Kang for knocking her awake. It would be wrong if she continued to be embarrassed! Why was it that the moment she encounters situations related to Feng Cang, she would lose her usual pride and personality?! Even if Feng Cang was her biological big brother, since she already fell in love, then she would even love in death! Not to mention that Feng Cang and her didn\u2019t have any blood relations. They should love each other even more without any scruples!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s gratitude stupefied Wanyan Kang. Then, he revealed a hearty smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s to thank?! No need to thank a big grace! But, when we\u2019re outside, I still need to call you little cousin sister to avoid those censors catching my language and then pray (nag) about me in front of emperor father. I can\u2019t stand those censors! It\u2019s just, suddenly getting a delicate as flower and refined as precious jade little cousin sister, I really can\u2019t get used to it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Delicate as flower and refined as precious jade: exquisite</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s arrival made the whole atmosphere become lighter. Looking at Wanyan Kang who was flirting and bickering with Su Mei, Murong Qi Qi thought about Wanyan Lie. If one day, she and Feng Cang stood opposite of Wanyan Lie, then would it be very difficult on Wanyan Kang as their friend?</p><br/><p>\u201cToda,y you come to look for our miss, it couldn\u2019t be so simple as to see our miss, right?!\u201d Su Mei saw that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mood was a lot better, and she also became happier. All this was because of those few words from Wanyan Kang. Although, those words didn\u2019t have any reasoning, but it\u2019s alright since miss liked them and miss was happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. If you didn\u2019t say it, I would\u2019ve forgotten the main reason. Cousin-in-law, my consort mother wants to invite you for tea at Jingxin hall\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying this, Wanyan Kang\u2019s expression was a bit awkward. It seemed that he had a trace of disgust towards consort De. Although it was fleeting, but Murong Qi Qi keenly captured this.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor tea?\u201d Murong Qi Qi felt that her relationship with Lin Ke Xin wasn\u2019t that deep. Just when her identity was revealed, Lin Ke Xin had already clung to her. What intention did she have?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tell you honestly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang admired Murong Qi Qi from the bottom of his heart. Although he calls her cousin-in-law, but the admiration inside it was true. Now, his consort mother wanted to calculate Murong Qi Qi. Wanyan Kang couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019re princess Zhen Guo. Your status is even above emperor father\u2019s biological daughter. So, those women in the palace are beginning to have ideas about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about how consort De hurriedly called him into the palace and said those words to him, Wanyan Kang couldn\u2019t help but sneer. Because of the tournament of the four countries this time, Wanyan Kang became very familiar with Murong Qi Qi. So, Lin Ke Xin found Wanyan Kang to let him come forward and invite Murong Qi Qi. Like that, Murong Qi Qi wouldn\u2019t refuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Have ideas about our miss? Then, is miss in danger?\u201d The moment Su Mei heard that, she stood up and wished she could rush into the palace and kill all those women with bad intentions.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang smiled at how Su Mei didn\u2019t understood the true meaning of his words.</p><br/><p>This girl was innocent and also simpleminded. Perhaps, it was because of this hot temper and innocence that attracted him! He felt tired and disgusted at those fighting and calculative women in the palace. Only when he was next to Su Mei did Wanyan Kang feel physically and mentally relaxed. A girl without any schemes and who was clean was very good!</p><br/><p>Seeing that Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t explain and only giggled foolishly at her, Su Mei got angry. A chestnut fell on Wanyan Kang\u2019s forehead, \u201cQuickly talk, ah! who wanted to calculate our miss, ah? Is it your consort mother? Say, on which side do you stand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei\u2019s chestnut made Wanyan Kang grimace in pain. He clutched his head and pretended to scream, \u201cAiyaya, so painful! Aiyaya, murdering husband, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMurder, your head, ah!\u201d Although she was saying that, Su Mei still couldn\u2019t help but go over to look, \u201cIs it really painful? Let me look!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook\u2026\u201d Wanyan Kang pouted full of grievances and showed the small bump on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Wanyan Kang was injured by her, Su Mei felt vexed. She forgot that she had great strength and didn\u2019t take that into consideration. Thinking that Wanyan Kang was a soft skinned and tender fleshed prince, where would he have ever suffered such a knock?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose!\u201d Su Mei immediately took out medicine for Wanyan Kang. \u201cQuickly tell me! What\u2019s going on?! You only said half the matter, truly making people anxious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang knew that the relationship between Murong Qi Qi and Su Mei was deep. Seeing Su Mei being so anxious about the matter of Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Kang simply explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThrough generations, only the most favored princess from the imperial family was qualified to be princess Zhen Guo. Princess Zhen Guo could enjoy the right to participate in politics and had military power. It\u2019s a supreme glory and also the symbol of power.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father bestowed cousin-in-law with the title of princess Zhen Guo. Presumably, in his heart, he loves cousin-in-law very much. In the future, don\u2019t know what kind of rewards he would give cousin-in-law. Now, the empress and consort mother are having ideas about cousin-in-law. With such a noble and powerful daughter-in-law, their son\u2019s status would be consolidated!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t very easy for Wanyan Kang to explain everything so clearly. On one side was Murong Qi Qi, the other side was his birth mother. That he could point out the ideas of those women in the palace and tell her, Murong Qi Qi knew that Wanyan Kang truly was helping her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, ah Kang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019re welcome!\u201d Wanyan Kang gestured with his hand, but the next moment, his expression turned serious. \u201cIn fact, it was I who should apologize. My consort mother truly went overboard. It was just, she\u2019s my consort mother; I could do nothing to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, I know your personality is that you would take revenge on what needed to be avenged. Today, I told you these so frankly, I also had my selfishness. I want to ask you for a request. If in the future, my consort mother does something wrong against you, please give me some face and leave her a way out. Take it as me begging you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s honesty make Murong Qi Qi think back about the test on the sixth floor of the pagoda. Wanyan Kang held the mirror and all the words he cried out were mother consort. It seemed that Wanyan Kang put a lot of weight on this mother. It was just, Lin Ke Xin had been immersed in power and ignored the love between mother and son\u2026</p><br/><p>Speaking of it, Wanyan Kang\u2019s playfulness were all a pretense. This prince looked bright, but he was only someone who wished for motherly love.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Murong Qi Qi answering so straightforwardly made Wanyan Kang let out a sigh of relief. As long as Lin Ke Xin doesn\u2019t go overboard, Murong Qi Qi wouldn\u2019t take action against her. He wished his consort mother would behave and not calculate too much!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, my consort mother wants to match you with my second big brother. However, you have cousin brother. Of course, your heart wouldn\u2019t fancy another. In fact, my second big brother is deep-minded. Cousin-in-law must be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was very grateful at Wanyan Kang\u2019s repeated reminders. This prince really is the weirdo of Bei Zhou\u2019s imperial family. Growing up in the imperial family, but he was still able to retain his personality and integrity. Wanyan Kang truly was someone not bad!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi looked at Su Mei. These two really matched each other. If they could be together, it would become a great story!</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, the imperial\u2019s edict arrived!\u201d At this moment, Feng Qi stepped with respectful step to Murong Qi Qi, \u201cPlease move to the front hall!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Feng, I couldn\u2019t bear you being so polite. Treat me like you usually does! Letting an elder like you be like this, would let my life be shortened!\u201d Murong Qi Qi could feel the respect of Feng Qi towards her. That was a respect of an elder from family towards a master of Feng family.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

For her, the emperor wished he could get the stars from the sky.</p><br/><p>However, the sexual desire Wanyan Lie had was a bit too strong. The old imperial physician didn\u2019t know just how many times, after Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s miscarriage, he had been woken up and dragged to Long Autumn palace to save the life of this imperial noble consort. The old imperial physician saw today\u2019s situation clearly. That bed and white clothes stained with blood had startled him a lot.</p><br/><p>If Wanyan Lie continued to \u2018pamper\u2019 like this, he was afraid that this niangniang1 would be like those past niangniang of this Long Autumn palace and won\u2019t live for much longer.</p><br/><p>The old imperial physician felt sympathy for Yue Lan Zhi. Not every person could bear an emperor\u2019s love. It was just, he\u2019s also just a subject. Besides, he\u2019s already so old. He should enjoy his old age. If he carelessly said something wrong and angered Wanyan Lie, making his head become separated from his body, then it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie narrowed his eyes. He looked at the old imperial physician\u2019s wrinkles on his face. His (WL) gaze followed along his (physician) chin till the cold sweat on his beard. He finally laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhen2 understands. You should just treat her. Zhen promises you that I would not touch her! As long as it\u2019s good for her body and this palace has it, you can go take it! If you heal imperial noble consort, zhen will reward you heavily!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! This subject accepts the command!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old imperial physician sighed from relief. He could be considered to have passed this calamity. He hoped that Yue Lan Zhi would get well and be safe after eating his medicine. He\u2019s already old. He could no longer take these shocks.</p><br/><p>After the old imperial physician retreated, Wanyan Lie entered to take a look at Yue Lan Zhi. Under the light, her face was very pale. Her face, as small as a handpalm, didn\u2019t have a single trace of blood. Even the usually soft like flower petals lips were also pale.</p><br/><p>The quietness made Yue Lan Zhi feel scared. She opened her eyes. Seeing Wanyan Lie staring at her, she struggled to sit up: \u201cEmp\u2026emperor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort, you lie down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie stepped forward and gently let her lay back down. He personally covered her with the bedding.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort, the imperial physician already said that your body is too weak. You should rest well and nurse yourself back to health. You can relax. What you want, what you need, you just need to say it. Zhen will bring it to you. As long as you get better, zhen is willing to do everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, just now, it was zhen who was wrong! Zhen loves you too much! Every time, zhen couldn\u2019t control myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie held Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s slender and cold hand and put it gently on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because zhen loves you too much, that\u2019s why zhen wants to keep you forever at zhen\u2019s side. Sorry Yue er,3 zhen is truly wrong, zhen truly knows that zhen is wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s doing it again and again! Feeling the wet feeling of tears in her hand, Yue Lan Zhi was scared.</p><br/><p>Every time, after treating her rudely like that, he would be like this. It was like he completely changes to someone else. He becomes so gentle. In the end, which one is the real him? In the end, what was he truly thinking? Although the time she was at Wanyan Lie\u2019s side was not short, she still couldn\u2019t see through him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort, touch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie put Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s hand on his chest to let her feel his heartbeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you feel it? This whole heart is beating for you. It\u2019s because zhen has you that makes zhen continue to persist. Yue er, you must be fine. If you die, what should zhen do? How could zhen endure the days without you? Zhen will certainly follow you (in death); not being able to be born on the same day, will definitely die on the same day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi covered Wanyan Lie\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, how could you say such words again? You are the one who will live ten thousand, ten thousand years. Chenqie4 is just your slave. Chenqie couldn\u2019t afford to bear what you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er, you\u2019ve forgiven zhen, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Yue Lan Zhi open her mouth to speak, Wanyan Lie was exceptionally excited. The eyes looking at her were also like shining crystal tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er, do you still love zhen? Like how zhen loves you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi felt bitter after hearing Wanyan Lie. Why was it like this every time? Could it be that he didn\u2019t realize that acting like this would hurt people very much? Trampling her without the slightest scruple like that, and now he\u2019s crying like this\u2026If he truly and sincerely felt repentance, why did he continue to repeatedly hurt her? Why?</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi didn\u2019t speak for a long time. Wanyan Lie\u2019s tears fell on Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhen knows that Yue er doesn\u2019t want to forgive zhen, no matter what! It was zhen who caused our child to die! Everything is zhen\u2019s fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s fists hit his face, making Yue Lan Zhi flustered. She quickly grabbed Wanyan Lie\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, chenqie, chenqie has never blamed you! Your love is chenqie\u2019s blessing! Chenqie was willing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wanyan Lie\u2019s hands finally stopped. The raised-up head still had traces of crying, but no more tears fell out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er, do you mean it? You truly love zhen? You won\u2019t leave zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, chenqie will stay by your side forever! Until\u2026you\u2019re tired of chenqie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this sentence, Wanyan Lie finally exposed the first smile since he\u2019d entered this room. And this gentle laughter couldn\u2019t help but let Yue Lan Zhi shudder.</p><br/><p>Was it her imagination? Why was Wanyan Lie\u2019s laughter not the same this time? There seemed to be something else inside that laughter. It was just, she couldn\u2019t catch what it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would zhen get tired of you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s big hand followed the pattern of Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s white undergarment and probed into it. He seized that cloud and didn\u2019t take into account the coldness of Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s body. His big hand grabbed it. The callus of his palm rubbed it until Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s face became pinkish.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, chenqie really can\u2019t, really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi shook her head and bit her lips. Her tears came up. She actually forgot that he\u2019s a demon. Just now, she almost indulged herself in the demon\u2019s lies.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Zhen is just telling you that zhen will love you forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the fear in Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s eyes, Wanyan Lie smiled while retrieving his hand. He once again tucked Yue Lan Zhi in.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest well! Recover quickly! Zhen truly loves the wonderful moments with beloved consort! Don\u2019t let zhen wait for too long, yo!\u201d</p><br/><p>He bent over. Wanyan Lie\u2019s warm lips fell on the corner of Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s eye and sucked the tears away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er, I love you! Forever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Yue Lan Zhi closed her eyes. Her tears rolled out again. She knew that those words were not said to her. It was just like what Wanyan Lie had previously said. No matter how much she imitated, she couldn\u2019t be compared to that woman in the underground tunnel. And the \u2018Yue er\u2019 he always called was in fact calling for that woman and not her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, your tears fell into zhen\u2019s heart. Zhen hurts, really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s deep and magnetic voice, coupled with the ambergris fragrance of his body, made people almost indulge in his pampering and gentleness. It was just, it was not the first time that she had fallen for it. This time, she absolutely won\u2019t fall for it!</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s tears fell, one by one. Every one of them entered Wanyan Lie\u2019s mouth and then these bitter tears were fed into her mouth. Acting differently from the rude and arrogant behavior of before, Wanyan Lie\u2019s kiss was now gentle. Careful and full of magic, making people couldn\u2019t help but indulge in that kiss. If it wasn\u2019t because of the pain on her body reminding her, she would\u2019ve been deceived by him once again.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Yue Lan Zhi finally stopped crying, Wanyan Lie stood up satisfied. He called Jing De: \u201cPass zhen\u2019s decree. Long Autumn palace\u2019s imperial noble consort Yue is truly to zhen\u2019s taste. Especially rewarding her with a pair of gold and jade jewelries, a peacock feather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When all those rewards from Wanyan Lie were brought into Long Autumn palace, Yue Lan Zhi had long turned numb. At first, she was grateful towards these rewards from Wanyan Lie. Now, she\u2019s already so numb to these that she wouldn\u2019t even want to thank the emperor for this grace.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know how many times Wanyan Lie used this tactic. The things he rewarded were always more extravagant and more gorgeous than the previous time, but each time, she had been injured even more than the previous time. She really didn\u2019t know when such a life would end. Is it that only when she dies will he let go of her and give her freedom?!</p><br/><p>\u201cChenqie thanks the dragon\u2019s (emperor) grace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only when Wanyan Lie left Long Autumn palace did Yue Lan Zhi slowly thank for this grace. It was just, Wanyan Lie had already walked far away.</p><br/><p>After he came out of Long Autumn palace, Wanyan Lie put his hands behind his back. He walked slowly and was in a very good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, the candidate for the replacement has been found.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jing De followed behind Wanyan Lie at the right pace. Not far nor near, just three steps away.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee when you have free time to go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? So quickly, she was found?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s voice revealed a trace of interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, take zhen there!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jing De brought a woman in white to Wanyan Lie, Wanyan Lie went wooden for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He stood up and walked to the girl. He stroked the girl\u2019s smooth face. Wanyan Lie pinched her chin and forced her to look at him.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie was very satisfied with the girl\u2019s appearance. She was about fifteen or sixteen years old. She looked like Wanyan Ming Yue before she had married. This time, the person Jing De found looked the most like Wanyan Ming Yue. It was just, he didn\u2019t know if the other parts were also like her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay something to let zhen listen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis slave greets emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s voice was melodious like an oriole of the mountain. However, just with one sentence, Wanyan Lie frowned and let go of her chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot the same! Yue er\u2019s voice is not so giddy. Your voice is too flamboyant. It needs to change!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl had become frightened of Wanyan Lie and quickly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, you can be considered lovable and clever! Retreat now! Jing De, let people take good care of her. Train her for few more days. When Feng Cang marries, bring her to Long Autumn palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jing De gave a hand gesture. Immediately, two palace maids came and escorted the girl away. When the girl left, Jing De came to Wanyan Lie\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, Murong Qi Qi is a princess from Xi Qi who came for a marriage alliance. If something happens to her on the wedding night, presumably Xi Qi won\u2019t leave the matter like that. Besides, Xi Qi\u2019s people are still in Yan Capital, if\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie raised his hand and interrupted Jing De.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no if. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s title is just a bestowed one. Besides, Feng Cang has those rumors. If she doesn\u2019t die, then people would feel surprised. No need to worry about this. In case if Xi Qi truly doesn\u2019t let the matter go, at worst, zhen will give them one princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, do you mean princess Bao Zhu?\u201d</p><br/><p>After remembering that Wanyan Bao Zhu had come to look for Wanyan Lie earlier today, Jing De suddenly understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cBao Zhu took a liking to Longze Jing Tian and came to beg zhen. Hehe, she\u2019s finally no longer obsessed with Feng Cang. Zhen is very pleased about this. Zhen had heard about that Longze Jing Tian. He is not bad! In the future, he is certainly Xi Qi\u2019s emperor! If marrying Bao Zhu to him, that means that the future empress of Xi Qi is zhen\u2019s daughter. Zhen can\u2019t be happier! When there\u2019s time, zhen will talk about this matter with Longze Jing Tian and see what his attitude is towards this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there still need to ask? Of course, this is what he is seeking, ah! To be able to marry princess Bao Zhu is a blessing he accumulated in eight lifetimes!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Jing De\u2019s words, Wanyan Lie was very happy. He only has this one daughter. Before, she was so obsessed with Feng Cang that she forgot what her name and surname were, giving him many headaches. He didn\u2019t expect that after she went to the tournament of the four countries, she took a fancy to Longze Jing Tian. This is very good, ah! As long as it\u2019s not Feng Cang, no matter who she wanted to marry, Wanyan Lie would agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Xi Qi still doesn\u2019t give up, then the responsibility is on Feng Cang and doesn\u2019t have anything to do with zhen. Zhen could just use this opportunity to let Feng Cang lead the army and destroy Xi Qi. This is a perfect excuse. If other countries want to hold someone accountable, then it\u2019s Feng Cang who is in the wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie thought about everything beautifully. Jing De repeatedly praised him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, this is an excellent plan, excellent plan! No matter what, Feng Cang wouldn\u2019t be able to overturn emperor\u2019s palm! Emperor is wise!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Wanyan Lie laughed, princess Bao Zhu was now at the East palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, what\u2019s the matter? It\u2019s already so late; why did little sister came to this crown prince\u2019s palace? Could it be to talk about the sibling love between us?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong yawned with a look full of sleepiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial big brother, Zhao Lang is dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Wanyan Bao Zhu opened her mouth, it let the fatigue on Wanyan Hong\u2019s face disappear immediately. Hearing her talk about Zhao Lang, Wanyan Hong sat up and let the others retreat. When looking at Wanyan Bao Zhu again, Wanyan Hong\u2019s eyes turned darker.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did little sister found out the relationship between Zhao Lang and this crown prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m Chou er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu took down the human skin mask on her face, revealing her original face. Wanyan Hong was startled for a moment. After that, Wanyan Bao Zhu told Wanyan Hong all the things that had happened before Zhao Lang\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Hong heard that in the end, Zhao Lang\u2019s head was cut off and put on a snowman, Wanyan Hong\u2019s fist hit the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards! No wonder Zhao Lang didn\u2019t get in contact with this crown prince for so long. The people this crown prince had sent also couldn\u2019t find Zhao Lang. It turned out to be like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness the crown prince, please get revenge for Zhao Lang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu knelt down. Her head knocked on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease get revenge for Zhao Lang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, stand up to speak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong let Wanyan Bao Zhu stand up. His face fixed on hers, making Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart shiver. This man\u2019s gaze was very frightening, filled with a dark and gloomy atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was now somewhat uncertain. Did she do the right thing by coming to tell Wanyan Hong the truth?!</p><br/><p>\u201cPut the human skin mask on and let this crown prince take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong walked step by step to Wanyan Bao Zhu. He watched Wanyan Bao Zhu put the human skin mask on and turn back into Bei Zhou\u2019s princess.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong reached out and gently pinched Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlike, indeed very alike! The skin feels very soft like that of a real human! If you didn\u2019t tell me the truth, this crown prince would\u2019ve thought that you\u2019re truly Wanyan Bao Zhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know why, Wanyan Bao Zhu saw an unbridled desire in Wanyan Hong\u2019s eyes, making her feel frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, Zhao Lang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing but a dead man, why mention him?! Useless thing; he couldn\u2019t even do such a simple matter well. He deserved to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong interrupted Wanyan Bao Zhu. His gaze swept smilingly over Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat this crown prince is interested in is you, my beloved little sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu didn\u2019t understand the matter yet, when she was pulled by his big hand into Wanyan Hong\u2019s embrace. Both of his hands clutched her waist. His strength was big, so that Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t break free.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, I\u2019m not the princess! I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, this crown prince knows you\u2019re not! You\u2019re so loud, could it be that you want to call everyone here?! Or is it that you wish to call this crown prince\u2019s imperial father over and let him know that you\u2019re a fake princess? Mm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong\u2019s tone finally let Wanyan Bao Zhu realize that she made a mistake coming here today!</p><br/><p>Originally, she wanted to use Wanyan Hong\u2019s hands to get rid of those people she despised. She didn\u2019t expect to have brought herself to Wanyan Hong\u2019s mouth and also let him use this matter to threaten her. Now, no matter how stupid she was, she could see his thoughts from the great desire in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu suppressed the trembling in her voice and strived to make herself look calmer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crown prince likes it more when you call this crown prince imperial big brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong\u2019s hand loosened the ends of her waistband.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good, let me hear you call this crown prince once!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial, imperial big brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One \u2018imperial brother\u2019 made Wanyan Hong excited. His big hand entered and grabbed Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s soft cloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crown prince had tried men, had tried women, but hadn\u2019t tried little sister yet. Hehe, although you\u2019re not this crown prince\u2019s biological little sister, but this face would do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was stunned. She completely didn\u2019t think Wanyan Hong would have such perverted thoughts. He simply is not a human!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is it that you want to say this crown prince is not a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Wanyan Bao Zhu to say something, Wanyan Hong already said Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s thoughts out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, this crown prince is not human. This crown prince is the future son of heaven, is the son heaven is proud of, how would this crown prince be an ordinary human?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu just called one \u2018your highness\u2019, Wanyan Hong used strength to pinch her cloud, making Wanyan Bao Zhu feel so much pain that her tears almost fell out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot well-behaved, oh! This crown prince is your imperial big brother! Be good, call this crown prince imperial big brother! Or, this crown prince will send you to the palace to let imperial father recognize this fake daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial big brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu wanted to cry but didn\u2019t have the tears.</p><br/><p>In the end, what happened to her? Poop must\u2019ve filled her brain! In order to get rid of Murong Qi Qi, she actually delivered her secret to this person and also suffered insult because of this! If she hadn\u2019t say anything, continued to be princess Bao Zhu and then married Longze Jing Tian, becoming his wangfei5 and later becoming Xi Qi\u2019s empress, how good would that have been?! Why was she so stupid?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

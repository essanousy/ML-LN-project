It moved with an imposing manner towards Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>When it nearly reached Feng Cang, Misha pushed the small button on the handle. A thick black smoke emanated from the nine-section whip.</p><br/><p>Yi Lian, you want him to live, want to be sweet and happy together, I won\u2019t allow it! In the past life, you belong to me. This life, you should also belong to me!</p><br/><p>Misha was fast, but Feng Cang was faster. He had long known from Feng Qi Qi that Misha was a \u2018treacherous &amp; vile person\u2019. Even when he\u2019d ruined his whip, Feng Cang didn\u2019t lower his guard.</p><br/><p>The moment the black fog appeared, Feng Cang back-rolled and dodged the black mist that was coming at him. His body was like a dragon; he moved closer to the ground and then attacked Misha.</p><br/><p>The black fog spread. The surrounding area was enveloped in a black smoke and wrapped around Feng Cang\u2019s and Misha\u2019s bodies, making the people on the outside unable to see what was happening inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang! Cang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, the smoke is not poisonous!\u201d Su Mei and Su Yue, one at the right and one at the left had their arms around Feng Qi Qi\u2019s arms so that she didn\u2019t feel worried.</p><br/><p>From inside the black fog came the sounds of fighting. The collision of weapons became more and more intense. Feng Qi Qi also became more and more nervous. Although Feng Cang let her not be worried and told her that he would deal with everything, but now in front of her was a black fog. She couldn\u2019t see what was happening inside. How could Feng Qi Qi not be worried?</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang, I won\u2019t let you get Yi Lian! She\u2019s mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the black fog, Misha screamed. Since his legs were disabled, he had been looking for more suitable ways to fight. The wheelchair couldn\u2019t replace his legs and couldn\u2019t be as flexible as his legs. Therefore, he could only change to something else.</p><br/><p>For example, lead the enemy into his own circle. Let him and the other party be enveloped in the black fog. This fog was made from special ingredients created by him. It could condense into small pieces in the air and let outsiders unable to clearly see the situation in the inside.</p><br/><p>Even such a high skilled person like Feng Cang also needed time to adapt. He (M) didn\u2019t need that. Because of his previous trainings, Misha already let himself be shrouded in this darkness. This blackness was his cover.</p><br/><p>Without a healthy body, he had to use other ways to prevail over the enemy.</p><br/><p>Like now, Feng Cang, who was in the black fog, couldn\u2019t see anything, but he had already discovered Feng Cang\u2019s position.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding, ding, ding\u2026\u2019 The daggers on the nine-section whip made crispy sounds in the air. That centipede-like nine-section whip quietly attacked the motionless Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Go to hell\u2026Misha\u2019s face revealed a cruel smile. Yi Lian is mine! No one could steal her! \u201cFeng Cang! Go to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the nine-section whip was about to be entangled on Feng Cang\u2019s neck, the darkness on Misha\u2019s face continued to expand. He wanted to cut off Feng Cang\u2019s head!</p><br/><p>\u2018Dang\u2026\u2019Just when Misha\u2019s smile increased to the maximum, the sword in Feng Cang\u2019s left hand blocked the attack of the nine-section whip. \u2018Hualala!\u2019 The nine-section whip wrapped around the sword like a snake. Because of the collision, the daggers on the interface made crispy sounds.</p><br/><p>That his attack didn\u2019t hurt Feng Cang made Misha surprised. Not waiting for him to understand, Feng Cang flew in the sky. His left hand rotated and let the nine-section whip be tightly wrapped on the sword, making Misha unable to retrieve the nine-section whip.</p><br/><p>A wind condensed in Feng Cang\u2019s right palm and attacked Misha. \u201cNot good!\u201d Misha was shocked. He couldn\u2019t care any longer. His right hand let go of the nine-section whip. His hands slammed on the handle of the wheelchair. His body soared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Boom!\u2019 Feng Cang\u2019s right palm crushed Misha\u2019s wheelchair.</p><br/><p>Without the wheelchair, Misha fell and rolled on the ground. He was in a very sorry state. \u201cYoung master!\u201d At this moment, Xia Xue\u2019s voice spread over. \u201cYoung master, climb on my back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue reached out and carried Misha on her back. \u201cYoung master, use my weapon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue\u2019s sudden appearance was like a timely assistance on a rainy day, solving Misha\u2019s crisis. Misha\u2019s left hand held Xia Xue\u2019s neck, but unexpectedly, he\u2019d touched the wounds on Xia Xue\u2019s neck, making her tremble in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026,\u201d Misha hadn\u2019t finished apologizing yet, when Feng Cang\u2019s next round of attacks came.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ping, ping, pang, pang,\u2019 sword collided with sword and made some sparks.</p><br/><p>Xia Xue carried Misha on her back and moved in the black fog. The two coordinated flawlessly. It was as if Xia Xue was Misha\u2019s legs. She was able to escape danger with him and also deal with Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, hold well!\u201d The pain on her neck stimulated Xia Xue. However, compared to her bleeding wounds, protecting Misha was Xia Xue\u2019s most important task. Fortunately, when she and Misha were at Penglai Island, they once had many similar training sessions. Had to say, Misha was someone who prepared for a rainy day. He had put enough effort to overcome the shortcoming of not being able to move. Otherwise, now, without the wheelchair, he would\u2019ve died at Feng Cang\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>With Xia Xue, Misha was like a normal person. His left hand tightly held Xia Xue\u2019s neck. The sword in his right hand pierced fiercely at Feng Cang\u2019s key points.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang had long known that Misha wasn\u2019t easy to deal with. He (FC) didn\u2019t think that he (M) had a lot of contingency plans. This pair of master and servant coordinated so well with each other, it seemed that they had done training in this area before. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have coordinated so well now.</p><br/><p>\u201cMisha, Misha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At a side, Jia Lan and Jin Yu, who\u2019d fainted earlier, gradually woke up. Originally, Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t want to take the lives of the innocent. She only let Yanzhi add some drugs that would let people fall asleep in the dishes.</p><br/><p>The fact that they woke up so quickly was because firstly, Misha had discovered that there was something fishy about the three men. They were in a hurry to leave and didn\u2019t get to eat much. Secondly, it was because they had a strong resistance to these types of drugs. So, they woke up not long after.</p><br/><p>When Jia Lan saw the black fog in the open space and heard the sounds of fighting from inside it, he was very worried. He was so anxious that he wanted to go inside and help Misha. However, he hadn\u2019t taken a step inside yet, when two golden threads flew over and blocked the way in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you?!\u201d Seeing Feng Qi Qi once again, Jia Lan was very surprised. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to explain to you why I am here. However, I need to remind you, this is a grudge between me and Lian Sheng. It\u2019s better if you don\u2019t intervene; otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words made Jia Lan understand everything thoroughly. With a face of disbelief, he said, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re the Yi Lian Misha was talking about? But aren\u2019t you Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Zhen Guo Feng Qi Qi? How could you be Yi Lian?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan had many questions, but Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t have time to explain so much to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to discuss that with you! In short, don\u2019t intervene in the fight between me and him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi not explaining made Jia Lan angry. \u201cCan\u2019t! I don\u2019t care what is between you two, but Misha is my Penglai Island\u2019s people. He\u2019s my senior brother. I can\u2019t not help him when he\u2019s in trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJia Lan, don\u2019t be someone who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you!\u201d Feng Qi Qi was also annoyed. \u201cBefore, when you\u2019d rescued Murong Qing Lian from my hand, I\u2019d already warned you! Since you want to be like this, then don\u2019t blame me for not having mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two golden threads in Feng Qi Qi\u2019s hands emitted a dazzling glow in the sunlight, making the other\u2019s eyes blur in response. After a moment of hesitation, the golden thread was wrapped around Jia Lan tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, release me!\u201d Jia Lan struggled, but he simply couldn\u2019t get rid of the golden threads.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t struggle! This is golden silk. You can\u2019t break free!\u201d Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t want to kill Jia Lan because she didn\u2019t want to become enemies with Penglai Island. The fetal poison in Feng Cang came from Penglai. She happened to have helped Jia Lan and wanted to see if she could help Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the more strength Jia Lan used, the tighter the golden threads on his body became. In the end, he couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of our sir!\u201d Jin Yu saw that Jia Lan was caught. He anxiously chopped at Feng Qi Qi, but Su Mei and Su Yue weren\u2019t easy to deal with. The two fought with Jin Yu. It was just, Su Mei and Su Yue didn\u2019t like to fight. The two were experts in poisons. They directly used poison. In a short time, they had dealt with Jin Yu and tied him up tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Qi Qi, are you going to provoke Penglai Island and become enemies with Penglai Island?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yu was caught. Misha was in the black fog. He himself was tied. All this made Jia Lan couldn\u2019t help but raise his tone and bring out Penglai Island.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026,\u201d Feng Qi Qi laughed. She turned and looked at Jia Lan. \u201cHadn\u2019t Penglai Island long been dissatisfied with our Bei Zhou? Otherwise, why would you instigate Xia Jin to send the army?! It was your Penglai Island that was heartless first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan thought that Feng Qi Qi had misunderstood Misha and thought that he (M) sowed discord behind their back, making Xia Jin send the army. He immediately explained for Misha\u2019s sake, \u201cMisha didn\u2019t do it! We only just found about this matter recently. Eldest senior and I are rushing back to resolve this matter. We also don\u2019t want for a war to break! This was certainly done by second senior brother Duyi! You\u2019ve misunderstood Misha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t expect that the words would actually reveal the one behind Dong Lu, \u201cDuyi? You said that it was done by him? However, why would Xi Qi and the Jurchen tribe also send their armies? Could this also be done by Duyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe also don\u2019t know about this. When we go back, it will become clear after an investigation. Duyi had long refused to accept Misha. He definitely took advantage of senior Misha\u2019s absence this time to do such a thing! This truly has nothing to do with eldest senior brother! Don\u2019t aim at Misha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Jia Lan\u2019s expression that was anxious for Misha, Feng Qi Qi could determine that this person didn\u2019t lie. Indeed, the matter of Dong Lu had nothing to do with Misha. It seemed that they should let someone go investigate this person called Duyi. Who was it that contacted everyone behind their backs and let Bei Zhou be attacked by enemies from three sides?</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for providing me with information! But the problem between me and Misha has nothing to do with Dong Lu sending the army! This is our private grudge. He must die today!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the two were talking, the black fog on the open space had almost disappeared. Xia Xue was piggybacking Misha. She was in a very sorry state. She was kneeling on the ground. Xia Xue took big mouthfuls of air. The hair on her forehead was messy. Misha was also not much better. Misha\u2019s left shoulder had received a cut. The wound was very deep. The capped bone could be seen.</p><br/><p>In contrast, Feng Cang stood at the other side. His left hand was still holding the sword in reverse. The blood on the edge of the sword dropped on the yellow land. In just a moment, it was absorbed by the soil and became a black area.</p><br/><p>Compared to the sorry states of Misha and Xia Xue, Feng Cang\u2019s white clothes were still spotless. If it wasn\u2019t because the edge of the blade was still bleeding, others simply couldn\u2019t see any traces of fighting on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Lian, your man is very good!\u201d Misha endured the pain and looked at Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Just now, he had heard the dialogue between Feng Qi Qi and Jia Lan. Feng Qi Qi\u2026this was Yi Lian\u2019s name of this life. Sure enough, the one who broke the seven-level pagoda was her! Feng Qi Qi was the person he had been looking for!</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t look at Misha. Instead, she went to Feng Cang, \u201cCang, are you still alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very fine!\u201d Feng Cang smiled gently, but inadvertently hid the slightly trembling right hand into his sleeve to not let Feng Qi Qi see it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She is just a humble little girl, but the cold aura coming from her actually made Murong Xin Lian feel terrified. It\u2019s just that she can\u2019t lose. She can\u2019t back off. She can\u2019t be looked down by Murong Qi Qi this rubbish. She can\u2019t even more not avenge Zheng Min!</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi hid leisurely behind Su Mei, Murong Xin Lian looked down on her even more. When something happens push a servant out to block everything, she Murong Qi Qi is not some good bird!</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian has completely forgotten that the reason all this happened is because the evil in her heart. In the end it caused today\u2019s consequences. She put the blame of all what happened to her on Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you go to hell\u2026\u2026,\u201d Murong Xin Lian screamed. The beautiful facial features contorted because of hatred.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ka\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Just as Murong Xin Lian is fantasizing about how the whip will hook around Su Mei\u2019s slender neck and strangle the life out of her, a sound can be heard. The whip has been clamped by Su Mei\u2019s index and middle finger. The whip can\u2019t be moved anymore.</p><br/><p>Impossible! Murong Xin Lian\u2019s expression stiffened. She can\u2019t believe what is happening in front of her. The other party only used two fingers and easily resolved her level three inner energy.</p><br/><p>No, this is impossible! Murong Xin Lian pulled the whip wildly. She wanted to pull it from Su Mei\u2019s fingers. But despite that she used all her energy, the whip still didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Who is this maid? She is obviously just a cheap maid. Why does she know martial arts? And her martial arts are far above hers!</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian looked at the leisurely Murong Qi Qi with a look full of unbelievableness. No wonder she can be so arrogant. At her side, there\u2019s actually a maid with such capability! In the end in what kind of luck did she walk on!</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian thought that Su Mei is just an ordinary maid. She can just bribe her. She immediately changed to a soft expression and threw out the temptation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss really have good capabilities, ah! You are so capable; why do you need to stay by her side?! A fine bird chooses a tree to nest in, as long as you leave that rubbish and come to serve me, I assure you, the moment you come, I\u2019ll let you be the head maid and I\u2019ll pay you five liang a month! Moreover, if I marry, you can follow me as a dowry maid! What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang: chinese currency (chinese coins). Teals: chinese currency only available in gold and silver</p><br/><p> A fine bird chooses a tree to nest in: a talented person chooses a patron of integrity.</p><br/><p> A dowry maid is someone who follow their owner when they marry. They have the chance to become the concubine of their master\u2019s husband. It\u2019s consider a honor because then they can get rid of their status as maid.</p><br/><p>Using gain as lure? Murong Qi Qi lazily changed position. With only five liang, she wants to get the allegiance of Su Mei, Moyu\u2019s killer of the fourth rank? Poop must\u2019ve really entered Murong Xin Lian\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Su Mei didn\u2019t speak, Murong Xin Lian thought she is moved, so she continued to \u2018guide patiently and systematically\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see; this rubbish\u2019s reputation is so bad. If you follow her, you won\u2019t have good days in the future. People walk to the higher path, water flows to the downward path. You are still so young. How can you waste your youth on this rubbish? Follow me, I\u2019ll surely give you a whole new life! If you don\u2019t mind, you can call me big sister. In the future we can be sister, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian is calculating with a smile. Having such an expert to follow her, her waist won\u2019t be sour and her legs won\u2019t hurt. Walking will also have more vigor. If she encounters Murong Qing Lian, she doesn\u2019t need to be humble anymore! What is Murong Qi Qi? What this rubbish can give, she can also give. Moreover the conditions are more generous than Murong Qi Qi\u2019s! She doesn\u2019t believe that throwing such a \u2018generous\u2019 treatment, Su Mei will not be tempted.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s \u2018believing in herself infallible\u2019 once again reached a high level. Su Mei saw her beautiful face, her (SM) mouth revealed a mocking smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive liang? Dowry maid? Sisters? Murong Xin Lian, why don\u2019t you look at the mirror! Who do you think you are?! I\u2019ll tell you, even a strand of your hair can\u2019t be compared to our miss! Even if you give me ten thousand golden taels, I won\u2019t be following you. Because, you don\u2019t deserve\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Being rejected by Su Mei and the words are so ugly to hear, it\u2019s like she has been slapped in the face in public. Moreover, it\u2019s in front of this rubbish Murong Qi Qi. Murong Xin Lian\u2019s face immediately turned black.</p><br/><p>\u201cBitch, don\u2019t be unable to tell the good from the bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who can\u2019t tell good from bad is you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei contemplated coldly. She grabbed the whip and threw Murong Xin Lian in the air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa, pa, pa\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The whip broke into parts long like a thumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Su Mei\u2019s light command, the broken parts of the whip flew into the air like rain and hit hard on Murong Xin Lian\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian felt pain. She lost balance. She fell from the air and smashed straight onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, miss how are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui heard sounds, she immediately rushed to Murong Xin Lian\u2019s side and helped her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, are you injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian has never been so embarrassed. The other party is just a cheap maid. She actually dares to humiliate her like this!</p><br/><p>Looking a Fei Cui in front of her and thinking about the maid beside Murong Qi Qi, comparing them, Fei Cui is just a useless thing. Thinking till here, Murong Xin Lian got a towering rage. She slapped Fei Cui\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Receiving a slap in the face without reason, Fei Cui felt very wronged. She didn\u2019t do anything, why did miss slap her?</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sisteryou yourself are useless. Why take it out on the people by your side?! After all, Fei Cui is someone who came from my side. You slapping her, is it not like slapping my face?! Yo, look, this small face is so aggrieved. Really pitiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know when, Murong Qi Qi also has come to ground. Seeing the scene of Fei Cui being slapped, Murong Qi Qi chuckled loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui, why don\u2019t you come back at my side?! I\u2019ll let you be the head maid. Your salary will rise to five liang a month. When I get married, you will be my dowry maid. When you go over with me, you can be a concubine, won\u2019t it be really good?! People walk to a higher path, water flow to the downward path. If you come back, I can let bygones be bygones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui knows that Murong Qi Qi is trying to drive a wedge. She immediately looked at Murong Xin Lan. She hoped that Murong Xin Lian will understand that she never has such a thought. But the furious Murong Xin Lian, although knowing that Murong Qi Qi is just giving her back the words she said, but the anger in her heart still can\u2019t be quelled. She need to vent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa pa!\u2019</p><br/><p>Again two slaps. Fei Cui\u2019s cheek immediately turned red. Seeing that blood appeared on her mouth, presumably some teeth must\u2019ve been broken. No wonder, Murong Xin Lian is still in the stage where she is using her inner energy. The force of the slap is ten times from that of usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cZeze ze! Second big sister has a really hard heart, ah! Fei Cui, you must feel wronged! If it wasn\u2019t because you told me second big sister\u2019s plan, the one who is causing hysteria today will be me. Don\u2019t worry, I know how to pay the debt of gratitude. Fei Cui, as long as you nod, even if I have an acrimonious falling out, I will get you back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked with sympathy at Fei Cui. That expression looked like she is really feeling heartache for Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, what, what are you talking about\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui shook her head and looked with a look of disbelief. What telling her second miss\u2019s plan? She didn\u2019t say anything, ah! Murong Qi Qi obviously wants to borrow somebody\u2019s else\u2019s sword to kill!</p><br/><p>After Fei Cui understood this, her face paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, this slave didn\u2019t betray you. You must believe this slave!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

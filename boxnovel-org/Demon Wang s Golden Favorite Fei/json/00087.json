Because she was busy dodging and because of the broken rib wasn\u2019t treated, now the rib seems to have dislocated. It stabbed in her chest; so painful that it made her whole body full of cold sweats. Obviously, she saw the red muslin in front of her, but she wasn\u2019t able to dodge it.</p><br/><p>The red muslin wrapped around Guli\u2019s left and right hand. Guli couldn\u2019t unwrap it. Twice there was a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound. Guli\u2019s wrist has been broken by the red muslin.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026,\u201d a shrill scream almost made the people became deaf. Those who were timid simply covered their eyes and only peeked through their fingers.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was not satisfied with only breaking Guli\u2019s hands. The red muslin wrapped around Guli\u2019s feet. Again a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound was heard twice. Guli\u2019s ankles have been crushed by the red muslin.</p><br/><p>Broken\u2026\u2026Long Duo\u2019s heart trembled. Guli\u2019s limbs could be considered a waste now. From the sound, the bones were crushed into small pieces of bones. Even if they find the best doctor, he won\u2019t be able to treat her.</p><br/><p>Looking the horror on Guli\u2019s face and the cold sweats on her forehead, Long Duo shook his head. Although this woman is domineering and have a bit of a vicious heart, but after all she\u2019s Nan Feng\u2019s citizen. Now, she became like this. Long Duo could only say Guli didn\u2019t have eyes to have messed with a seemingly unremarkable, but in fact is hidden very deep woman.</p><br/><p>However, the shock Murong Qi Qi brought Long Duo was bigger. Just now, he has been watching Murong Qi Qi and didn\u2019t let go of any fragment. This Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t use any inner energy, but the moves she put out were so vicious. Every one of them was deadly.</p><br/><p>Long Duo was keenly aware that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t want to take Guli\u2019s life so quick. No matter if it was the cat and mouse game at the beginning or the eye-catching dance later, if Murong Qi Qi really wanted Guli\u2019s life, then the red muslin won\u2019t fell on the slab next to Guli every time.</p><br/><p>With her control over the strength of the red muslin, her accuracy should also be very good. This Murong Qi Qi wanted to continue play with Guli, exhaust her and then torture her.</p><br/><p>Having these made clear, Long Duo couldn\u2019t help but shudder. The eyes looking at Murong Qi Qi have a trace of fear. In his heart, he already determined that Guli lost and she lost very miserably. No matter if it was Murong Qi Qi who retreated first to stimulate Guli, made Guli sign the life and death agreement or the play of latter, she had Guli eating out of her palms. It\u2019s just till now Guli still hasn\u2019t woken up. Really sad\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Although in his mind, he made these things clear, but Long Duo didn\u2019t intend to help. This is Guli and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s life and death agreement. If he intervened, would It not be like offending Nan Lin wang? Moreover, they are both contestants. Without a Guli, is the same as one less competitor.</p><br/><p>This time the imperial noble concubine took the tournament between the four countries very seriously. The reward is also very high. If they really win, would this not mean one more person to split the reward? Thinking till here, Long Duo continued to watch the play at a side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have the guts, then kill me! If you have the guts, then kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Big drops of cold sweat rolled from Guli\u2019s forehead, but her eyes didn\u2019t show cowardice because of this. Instead, she was like a poisonous snake full of hate.</p><br/><p>\u201cLetting me live, I\u2019ll surely not let you off! I took a fancy on your man and won\u2019t let go! Kill me, otherwise you\u2019ll die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guli\u2019s sharp voice sounded extraordinary mournful on this cold duel site.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Guli Nigula vow in the name of the ancestors, if I stay alive, I\u2019ll definitely let this woman feel that living is more painful than death! Living is more painful than death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Death is near at hand, you still have such a resolute mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi humphed once and the red muslin in her hand was like a red snake wrapping around Guli\u2019s neck. She was just about to make her move, when she heard a shout \u201cplease spare the person!\u201d followed by three plum dart going straight at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang shouted and then a big cloak protected Murong Qi. The cloak waved once, a strong wind came and go, the plum darts were knocked to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuli! Guli, how are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>A man in green raised Guli\u2019s head. Only now, did he see that Guli\u2019s wrists and ankles were broke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung\u2026\u2026young master, Guli fears that I won\u2019t be able to participate in the tournament anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guli took big mouthfuls of breath. Blood gushed from her mouth making her chest red.</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi came, Long Duo of course couldn\u2019t continue to hide. So, he also stepped forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis miss, why did you need to use such a heavy hand on my people?\u201d</p><br/><p>After handing Guli over to Long Duo, Helan Lian Yi stood up. He turned and looked at Murong Qi Qi inside of Feng Cang\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cSelf-defense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s answer was very frank. Her eyes have been scanning Helan Lian Yi.</p><br/><p>Handsome. He looked like a clean and refreshing man. It\u2019s just, don\u2019t know how his personality is. Helan Lian Yi is Nan Feng\u2019s imperial noble concubine Helan Min\u2019s nephew. The special access pass of Nan Feng\u2019s You Yun states is in this person\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>From Xi Qi came the news that Ming Yue Chen disguised himself and hid among Nan Feng\u2019s missionaries. He followed them back to Nan Feng. Presumably, he\u2019ll take action one of these days.</p><br/><p>\u201cSelf-defense?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi said that, Helan Lian Yi sneered once.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss said it so high-sounding! It\u2019s obviously you who hurt her, how could there be talk of self-defense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her skills who is less than others! That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi being so rude, Helan Lian Yi still wanted to seek justice for Guli. Long Duo told him quickly what happened today.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgreement between life and death? Duel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Helan Lian Yi finally understood everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Just now I didn\u2019t investigate the reason and blamed miss. I was too rash. I apologize to miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Helan Lian Yi was talking, he cupped his hands at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, Guli is already seriously injured. In the future, she\u2019ll also be a rubbish. Asking miss to have mercy and let Guli go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi chuckled. Her fingers played with the red muslin. Her mouth revealed a devilish beautiful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Helan should care about yourself. Just now, you attacked bengong. What kind of punishment should you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s claim made Helan Lian Yi frown. He didn\u2019t know what kind of superior person Murong Qi Qi is. Long Duo quickly told him everything he (LD) inquired about Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Princess Zhao Yang?! Xi Qi\u2019s princes to form a marriage alliance with Feng Cang! Now that Helan Lian Yi understood, he somewhat regretted he took action. Even a fool could see Feng Cang\u2019s protectiveness towards Murong Qi Qi. Even though, he didn\u2019t hurt Murong Qi Qi, but after all, he attacked her. This is a troublesome matter\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGuli signed an agreement between life and death with bengong. How forceful she was before, is how bengong pays her an eye for an eye back. So, this duel hasn\u2019t ended yet. Asking young master Helan to back off. That\u2019s first. Secondly, just now, young master Helan attacked me in public. Don\u2019t know what the reason behind for that is? Between bengong young master Helan are no ill feelings, but young master used such vicious attacks on me; could it be that Nan Feng wants to destroy the marriage alliance between Xi Qi and Bei Zhou? Is that why you wanted to kill bengong? To block the matter? Or is it that young master has another motive for this trip?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyi at a side wanted to shout and applaud. Before, Jin Mo said this wangfei is a master at playing politics. He didn\u2019t expect that with only a few words, she involved Nan Feng in this matter. Really a genius, ah!</p><br/><p>At this point, Longze Jing Tian regretted so much, his intestines turned blue! Why, why did he let Murong Qi Qi go? Just now, those attacks of Murong Qi Qi; how could those be just learned a few tricks? To be able to turn a soft red muslin into a fierce weapon; how is this as simple as learned a thing or two from a master?!</p><br/><p>Moreover, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s performance and her communication skills showed that she\u2019s a woman born for power! If he could get such a woman as wife, he\u2019ll be more powerful than heaving an army! Longze Jing Tian now completely regretted! Therefore, the desire to get Murong Qi Qi became more intense!</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi, Helan Lian Yi almost vomited blood. Obviously, it was a simple \u2018saving person\u2019, from Murong Qi Qi it became a problem between countries! This woman looked petite and demure, but she let people unable to belittle her.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess! Just now, I was indeed rude. However, all what happened was because of my anxiousness to save people and didn\u2019t find out the reason before taking action. It has nothing to do with Nan Feng and definitely doesn\u2019t have the intention to break the marriage alliance between Xi Qi and Bei Zhou. Now princess didn\u2019t suffer any loss and I know I was wrong. Asking princess to let this matter go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi bowed once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t let the matter go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi played with her jade like hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that young master Helan do business in the sixteen states of You Yun and the business is going very well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi didn\u2019t understand why Murong Qi Qi suddenly pulled his business into this. So, he could only smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just all because of the mighty imperial grace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Helan said this matter doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Nan Feng. Bengong doesn\u2019t believe it. Why doesn\u2019t young master Helan think for a moment and let bengong see your sincerity? Maybe then bengong will believe this matter has nothing to do with Nan Feng and that it is a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shameless, ah! Ruyi bit his lips. He almost shouted.</p><br/><p>Who said wangfei is gentle and pleasant, charming and virtuous?! Who said that?! That person\u2019s eyes definitely have a problem! Their wangfei extorted Helan Lian Yi in front of so many people and is obviously threatening him. Very outrageous!</p><br/><p>Ruyi finally understood that him always being respectful towards Murong Qi Qi was a right decision. Its\u2019 difficult to raise a woman and vile character. Offending wangfei, such a little woman is the most frightening thing.</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi became speechless. He has never seen a woman so shameless and who pester you so much. Is this not obviously intimidating him? Need to use money to seal her mouth, otherwise today\u2019s matter will rise and become a matter between countries! Then it\u2019s a diplomatic affair!</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, wangye, my chest hurt so badly! Certainly, it\u2019s because I was frightened just now. I was so frightened I got heart disease!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Helan Lian Yi hesitate, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s legs suddenly lost strength. With one hand on her chest, she fell into Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Haha\u2026\u2026Feng Cang\u2019s mouth twitched, but he still played along.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, what\u2019s the matter? Servants, summon the doctor! Quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>From Feng Cang\u2019s point of view, if his woman wants to play, then let\u2019s play! Even if she played till the other party dies, it doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s him to cover up. It\u2019s the best for a woman to be arrogant and rude. If she\u2019s obedient in front of other people, is that not obvious that she\u2019ll get bullied?!</p><br/><p>Now, Feng Cang simply loved Murong Qi Qi very much. He likes such a personality from her very much! In front of him, she has always been a white rabbit. In front of other, she\u2019ll become a leopard who\u2019ll bully others without blinking an eye. How come the more he looked at this woman, the more he likes her from the bottom of his heart?!</p><br/><p>Although in his heart, he loved Murong Qi Qi very much, but his expression was very tense.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, how do feel? Does it hurt very much? Rest assured, benwang will definitely let the culprit disappear without trace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking till here, Feng Cang\u2019s eyes swept coldly over Helan Lian Yi\u2019s neck. A burst of coldness!</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi swallowed his saliva with difficulty. In the past, he heard those stories about Feng Cang, but he himself didn\u2019t know much about this demon wang. Now meeting him, only a gaze from the other party was enough to let his heart give birth to rush of cowardice. It seems that today, he must loss money to prevent a disaster.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, my chest hurts so much. To be able to cure this disease, not having hundred thousand golden teals, I fear it won\u2019t do. Cough, cough\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi continued to act. The cough make her face red. Eyes brimming with tears, looking very pitiful completely different from how she looked when she destroyed Guli.</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred thousand,\u201d Helan Lian Yi yelled. He knew this matter won\u2019t pass easily, but he didn\u2019t expect that the other party will have the appetite of a lion and wanted hundred thousand golden teals! This is not a small sum. This woman really dared to open her mouth to ask that!</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u2026I fear that if delaying a bit more, even hundred thousand won\u2019t be enough to cure\u2026\u2026. cough, cough\u2026\u2026wangye, if something happens to me, you must not let Nan Feng off. You must get revenge for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi rolled her eyes and fainted in Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing! Qing Qing, how are you?! Why hasn\u2019t the doctor arrived yet?! Servants, put all of them in jail! If something happens to benwang\u2019s beloved consort, benwang will let Nan Feng go accompany her!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Helan Lian Yi completely fainted. And the eagle troop outside, immediately rushed in and surrounded Helan Lian Yi\u2019s group of people. They looked like they wanted to take them down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was reckless and frightened princess. Before dark, a hundred thousand golden teals will definitely be send. Asking princess to accept it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mouth, who was pretending to have fainted, revealed a smile of success. Oh, attack her? You dare to attack then I\u2019ll let you bleed! Murong Qi Qi slightly squinted her eyes to threw a glance at Ruyi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no proof with only talking. Asking young master Helan to sign an IOU!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyi was very willing to do errands for Murong Qi Qi. He put ink, brush and paper in front of Helan Lian Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that in front of so many people, I can back off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the other party being like that, Helan Lian Yi\u2019s temper also came. He didn\u2019t expect that the moment he finished speaking, at the other side Feng Cang will again shout: \u201cQing Qing, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Forget it! Today, he was too reckless and lost in in front of this couple! Helan Lian Yi didn\u2019t want to let people expand this matter infinitely. Everyone knows Bei Zhou\u2019s \u2018ambition of a wolf\u2019. If Feng Cang take this matter as excuse to send troops to Nan Feng, then won\u2019t he be the condemned one in Nan Feng\u2019s history!</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi put the brush in the ink and wrote the IOU. He put his fingerprint on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this alright?! Can I take Guli away now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said you can take her away?\u201d</p><br/><p>An elegant voice went through everyone\u2019s ears. The Murong Qi Qi who fainted in Feng Cang\u2019s arms, stood up. Ruyi immediately gave her the IOU to please little wangfei. Murong Qi Qi carefully looked at it once. When there was no problem with it, she let the ink dry. She carefully put away the IOU Helan Lian Yi wrote.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou played me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi was speechless. Although in his heart, he knew Murong Qi Qi was acting, but the other party didn\u2019t bother with that. Now, she\u2019s standing very fine in front of him, making him lose hundred thousand golden teals for nothing and also let him become a joke in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat young master Helan said isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s obviously you who attacked first. How is it bengong played you?! Bengong is helping you, ah. With only a hundred thousand golden teals, you let Nan Feng avoid disaster. Young master Helan is a big hero of Nan Feng, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi laughed and slowly walked to Helan Lian Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Helan Lian Yi is now afraid of Murong Qi Qi; afraid that the other party will feel pain here and there and put all of them on him. Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to be near him, he flashed to a side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi saw Helan Lian Yi like that, she chuckled. She came to Guli\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you dead yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you this poisonous woman, what do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bloodstain on Guli\u2019s mouth already became a bloodstream. After every word she said, she needed to pause for a long time. When she opens her mouth, blood will flow out. It seemed that her life won\u2019t be long.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong came to tell you; you like men, bengong has nothing against it. Men can have three wives and four concubines and frequent brothels. Why should women keep their purity? Why should they abide to those morals and ettiquettes\u2026\u2026However, you were wrong for liking bengong\u2019s man. Everything that bengong cares about, even if it\u2019s a clothing or a hairpin, bengong won\u2019t let anyone take them away, let alone bengong\u2019s man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026\u2026haha\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Guli heard Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018men can have three wives and four concubines and frequent brothels. Why should women keep their purity?\u2019, she laughed. She had a feeling she encountered an intimate friend. But unfortunately, it\u2019s at such a place and such a time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s I who got my hopes high\u2026\u2026got my hopes high\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guli\u2019s chest went up and down fiercer, but she struggled to stand up with the help of her hand. Her eyes looked at the far away Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>That man is white as jade, cold as frost. Only when looking at Murong Qi Qi, his gaze would transform into a gentle spring.</p><br/><p>So, it turned out that when two people are in love is like this. Guli laughed bitterly once. Although she has many men, but those men being with her, either they were indulged in her beauty and wanted to have pleasure on beds, or they have been pressured by her. There was never a person who looked at her with such infatuated and gentle eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I take back that curse of before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guli\u2019s chest has been dyed red by the blood from her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang, you, you are the first man I couldn\u2019t get\u2026\u2026Today, dying at her hands, I deserve it. However, I don\u2019t regret\u2026\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026\u2026if in the future, you betray her, even in death I won\u2019t let you off, this traitor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need you to worry about that. My woman, I will use every effort to protect and love her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang went forward and took Murong Qi Qi in his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this last word, Guli slowly fell onto the ground. Tears slid from her cheeks onto the ground. Her beautiful eyes were wide open. Even dying she looked infatuated at Feng Cang as if she had many regrets she couldn\u2019t say.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

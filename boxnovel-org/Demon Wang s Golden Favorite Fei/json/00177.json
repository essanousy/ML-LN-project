A good diversionary tactic. Only a hundred people scared away Tian Zhi Xin\u2019s five thousand men! If Feng Qi Qi\u2019s strategies and tactics were spread out, they would surely be recorded and passed down through generations. He hadn\u2019t seen her for six years, and it seemed that his Yi Lian grew up!</p><br/><p>\u201cOur princess invites you!\u201d One person stepped forward and beckoned with a hand. When Misha saw this, he laughed bitterly. It seemed that today, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get away!</p><br/><p>After Misha and Xia Xue entered Min province, they were sent under escort to Feng Qi Qi. From the first glance, Misha saw the slightly bulged belly of Feng Qi Qi. A sad feeling spread through his heart. His Yi Lian became someone else\u2019s wife and is expecting his child! Misha clenched his fist. His nails dug deep into the palm of his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Lian, long time no see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he had the status of \u2018prisoner\u2019, Misha still maintained an innocent smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say my name! Disgusting!\u201d Misha\u2019s smile was particularly a thorn in Feng Qi Qi\u2019s eyes. In the past life, this person used this smiling face to deceive adoptive father and her. How could he not feel even the slightest bit of guilt now and still smile heartlessly like this? Could it be that he had never regretted the matters of the past?</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words hurt Misha greatly. Yesterday, he really thought that she had forgiven him and gave him the opportunity to shake hands and make peace. He didn\u2019t expect that she really did hate him to the extreme.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past life, I committed suicide and repaid you with a life. Now, I\u2019m here. Take away my life as repayment for adoptive father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha closed his eyes, raised his head and revealed a smooth neck. He had the look of facing death with equanimity. This time, he embraced being defeated at Feng Qi Qi\u2019s hands. Earlier, Misha had thought that he needed to get Feng Qi Qi and use whatever ways to let her stay at his side. If he couldn\u2019t do that, then, be like this and let him die at her hands to offset the deep hatred in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Seeing Misha like this, Xia Xue hugged Misha and protected him in her arms. \u201cMiss Yi Lian, although I don\u2019t know what kind of grudges there are between you and my young master, but my young master truly loves you! I beg you to let my young master go. If you want to kill, then kill me! I will die in the place of my young master! I beg you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*** off!\u201d Misha pushed Xia Xue away. \u201cThis is between me and her. It has nothing to do with you, a lowly slave. Yi Lian, everything is my fault. Just kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*** off\u2026The further you f*** off, the better! It was because of you that I was caught. Useless thing!\u201d Misha scolded Xia Xue fiercely, making Xia Xue dumbfounded. \u201cYoung master, are you driving me away? Young master doesn\u2019t need Xia Xue to serve you anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want such a good-for-nothing like you! Useless rubbish! F*** off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s words were very ugly. Xia Xue\u2019s heart tore from pain. \u201cEven if young master doesn\u2019t like me and hates me, but I\u2019m young master\u2019s slave. Protecting young master is my duty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue knelt in front of Feng Qi Qi, kowtowed and begged, \u201cMiss Yi Lian, even if it is to accumulate virtues for the baby in your womb, let go of my young master, alright?! He loves you with his whole heart. Perhaps, he used the wrong methods, but there is nothing wrong with loving someone! Miss Yi Lian, I beg you! I beg you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*** off! I don\u2019t need your begging\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa, pa\u2026\u2019 Seeing such a scene, Feng Qi Qi gently clapped. \u201cSure enough, the master and the servant have deep feelings for one another. Lian Sheng, you have the desire to save her, why use such vicious language to hurt her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>His thoughts being pointed out by Feng Qi Qi made Misha\u2019s face become red. He immediately defended himself, \u201cThat\u2019s not it! I really hate her! Yi Lian, the one you want to kill is me. Everything she did was instructed by me. Don\u2019t make things difficult for her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMake things difficult? Haha, if you didn\u2019t say it, I wouldn\u2019t have had such thoughts. Now that you\u2019ve mentioned it, I really want to make things difficult for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi threw a small bottle at Misha. \u201cYour life is what you owe me. I can consider letting her go, but you must take this pill. Lian Sheng, you owe me too much. I don\u2019t want you to die so easily. That would be too good for you. Eat this pill. I will watch you slowly die in front of me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! I will eat it!\u201d Misha laughed bitterly. She really did hate him to the bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t!\u201d Xia Xue wanted to stop him but was held back by Su Mei and Su Yue. She could only watch Misha eat the poison.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the red blood in his palm, Misha laughed cheerfully, \u201cY Lian, I feel very happy to be able to die by your hand. If time could be turned back and return to the past, how great would that be?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, no\u2026,\u201d Looking at Misha\u2019s pale face and the way he vomited blood, Xia Xue broke free from Su Mei and Su Yue. She ran to Misha. \u201cYoung master, how could you be so silly?! She doesn\u2019t love you, but I love you, ah! Young master, why didn\u2019t you want to look at me? I was always by your side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Xue\u2026,\u201d Misha\u2019s view became blurry. He couldn\u2019t see Xia Xue\u2019s appearance clearly. He could only reach out and touch Xia Xue\u2019s face. \u201cGo! I did you wrong! However, in my heart, there\u2019s only Yi Lian. You couldn\u2019t enter it! Go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I want to stay with young master! No matter where young master goes, I want to stay with young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly woman!\u201d Misha laughed. His mouth was full of blood. It turned out that death was like this! Let him die slowly and drain the blood in his body\u2026Yi Lian, you really hate me so much? Why can you not forgive me?</p><br/><p>Misha felt that his body was turning cold. The pain in his chest was becoming more severe. It was a kind of pain that was hard to describe. It seemed that as though his soul was abruptly separated from the flesh and bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Lian\u2026,\u201d Misha struggled and looked in Feng Qi Qi\u2019s direction. It was just, at this time, his eyes were muddled. He could only see a cloudy white mist. He couldn\u2019t see anything\u2026 \u201cYi Lian\u2026when I\u2019m dead, can you let go of the hatred\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Lian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He called out several times, but no one answered. Xia Xue sobbed beside Misha, \u201cYoung master, miss Yi Lian has already left\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Left? Didn\u2019t she hate him very much and wanted to watch him die slowly with her own eyes? Why couldn\u2019t she look any longer? It must be because he looked very ugly now. So, she felt disgusted looking at him!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know after how long, but Misha\u2019s body gradually cooled down in Xia Xue\u2019s arms. \u201cYoung master!\u201d Xia Xue cried like her heart was torn and her lungs cracked. Her tears fell on Misha\u2019s face. \u201cYoung master, wait a bit. Xia Xue will immediately come to accompany you! Young master, Xia Xue wouldn\u2019t let you be lonely on the way to the netherworld!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xia Xue\u2019s dagger was about to stab her abdomen, a stone hit the dagger in her hand.</p><br/><p>Looking at Feng Qi Qi walking over, Xia Xue\u2019s eyes saw only redness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you return for? Did you want to see if he was dead yet? Young master died! He died! Are you satisfied now? I\u2019ve never seen such a heartless woman like you! What fault did young master have? His only fault was that he shouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with you. He shouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with such a stone-hearted and cold-blooded woman like you! Yi Lian, I hate you! Even if I turn into a ghost, I won\u2019t let you off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Xia Xue to cry out all the grief in her heart, Su Mei punched Xia Xue\u2019s neck. Xia Xue was startled for a moment, then she slowly fell to the ground while holding Misha. Even til the end, her hands were always tightly holding Misha and never loosened.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, did you think it through? Really letting them go? If we let the tiger return to the mountain, it would be troublesome in the future,\u201d Su Yue said softly while looking at Xia Xue and Misha on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Xue was right. Take it as accumulating virtues for my child! Moreover\u2026he would never remember me again. Send them away!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xia Xue woke up, she found herself in a common house. She wasn\u2019t dead? She thought that she\u2019s dead!</p><br/><p>She\u2019d just gotten out of bed when she remembered the last scene before she closed her eyes. \u201cYoung master! Young master!\u201d Xia Xue rushed out and saw a familiar figure sitting there. \u201cYoung master\u2026\u201d Xia Xue somewhat didn\u2019t dare to believe her eyes. When she approached, she found out that this person was real. He was Misha.</p><br/><p>At this time, Misha was leaning in the wheelchair with his eyes closed. The blood on the corners of his mouth had already dried up. The blood on his body also turned black. It seemed that the person was already dead for a long time. \u201cYoung master, young master!\u201d Seeing Misha\u2019s appearance, Xia Xue was very sad. She climbed on Misha\u2019s legs and cried!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, it\u2019s Xia Xue\u2019s fault. Xia Xue didn\u2019t take good care of you! Young master, don\u2019t leave Xia Xue, alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue cried sadly. Suddenly, a hand touched Xia Xue\u2019s face. \u201cXia Xue, why are you crying? What has happened? Why do I feel so bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the familiar voice, Xia Xue didn\u2019t react for a while and remained frozen. After looking again, Misha had opened his right eye and looked at her. This made Xia Xue shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, you didn\u2019t die? So great! Young master didn\u2019t die?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Xue, what silly things are you talking about? Why do I have to be death?\u201d Misha looked puzzled. When he touched the corner of his mouth and also saw the blood traces on his body, Misha screamed, \u201cWhat is up? Why did I bleed? Xia Xue, where is here? Why are we here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha asked so many questions at once, making Xia Xue didn\u2019t know where to start. At this time, Xia Xue\u2019s heart was fully filled with something called happiness. Her young master didn\u2019t die. Misha was still alive!</p><br/><p>Xia Xue couldn\u2019t guess why they were in such a strange place, but she was sure that Feng Qi Qi let them go.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, it\u2019s miss Yi Lian. She\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Lian? Who is Yi Lian?\u201d Hearing this name, Misha frowned. \u201cXia Xue, I asked you why we are here. Why are you talking about irrelevant people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s answer left Xia Xue completely dumbfounded, \u201cYoung master, you don\u2019t remember miss Yi Lian anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d Misha shook his head. \u201cIs this person important?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not important. She has nothing to do with us\u2026,\u201d Xia Xue bit hard on her lips and fought back the tears in her eyes. She finally understood the matter. Feng Qi Qi let them go, but she let Misha forget her forever. Perhaps, this was the best outcome for the two of them (FQQ &amp; M)!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, are you hungry? I will cook for you!\u201d Xia Xue wiped the corners of her eyes. Her heart burst from excitement. Before, she hated Feng Qi Qi for occupying the place in Misha\u2019s heart. Now she was full of gratitude towards that generous woman. Not only did Feng Qi Qi give Misha a new life, she also gave her (XX) a fresh start!</p><br/><p>\u201cHungry. Xia Xue, I want to eat noodles\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good! I will make noodles for young master!\u201d Xia Xue happily went to the kitchen. Misha pushed the wheelchair and followed her. When the cooked noodles were put in front of Misha, Misha didn\u2019t want to use chopsticks and insisted on Xia Xue feeding him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master seemed more and more like a child!\u201d Although, Xia Xue was complaining, but she felt very sweet in her heart. No matter what Misha is like, as long as he could forget Feng Qi Qi, even if he became a fool, she would be willing to stay with him!</p><br/><p>Su Mei looked at the two people in the courtyard and slowly retreated. When she returned to the city of Min province and told everything of Misha and Xia Xue to Feng Qi Qi, Feng Qi Qi sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, are you not happy? If you\u2019re unhappy, this subordinate will go and kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Hearing Su Mei say that, Feng Qi Qi shook her head. \u201cLike Lian Sheng said. In the past life, he repaid me a life. Before, he took the poison and died one time. He also repaid adoptive father a life. Moreover, after eating my pill, Lian Sheng\u2019s mind would gradually degenerate. In the end, he would become and innocent child and wouldn\u2019t have the ability to hurt people anymore. We are even now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi raised her head and looked at the distant sky. Adoptive father, was I right by doing this? Although, I really wanted to kill him to avenge you, but the you in heaven wouldn\u2019t want us to massacre one another!</p><br/><p>After dealing with Misha\u2019s matter, Feng Qi Qi felt that the gloominess in her heart was gone. Misha become someone of the past. With such a loyal person like Xia Xue at Misha\u2019s side, they would have a fresh start.</p><br/><p>With the disappearance of the danger and Misha\u2019s grudges, Feng Qi Qi slept very well and deeply this night.</p><br/><p>It was a very quiet night. A silver moonlight penetrated and spread over Feng Qi Qi\u2019s body and plated her with a layer of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Su Yue who kept the watch, heard someone approach. She immediately came out to check. When she saw the person who jumped down, Su Yue was very surprised, \u201cGu\u2026guye?!\u201d1</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Feng Cang at the south of ten thousand miles away? Why did Feng Cang appear here? After the surprise, Su Yue was very excited. She was just about to go tell Feng Qi Qi but was stopped by Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d Feng Cang covered in dust appearance looked a bit sorry. However, the chaotic hair on his forehead didn\u2019t let his appearance lose points. Instead, it added some heroic spirit on him. \u201cWhere is Qing Qing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss is already asleep\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Let me! You can go rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang lightly entered the room. When he saw the person on the bed who let his soul be entrapped, and his dreams be troubled, Feng Cang almost couldn\u2019t help himself from wanting to kiss her. It was just, looking at Feng Qi Qi sleeping so sweetly, Feng Cang carefully took of the armor and also carefully walked to the bed.</p><br/><p>1.

Su Mei had gone inside to notify. In the end, she still hadn\u2019t returned, making her (XYX) anxious from waiting.</p><br/><p>Although Xia Yun Xi wanted to go in directly, but this was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s place. In any case, she should leave a good impression on her future sister-in-law. After all, there were some things that she needed Murong Qi Qi to do. She couldn\u2019t treat her like Ruyi and go overboard.</p><br/><p>Just as Xia Yun Xi had become a bit impatient from waiting, a man in silver clothes arrived.</p><br/><p>Originally, Wanyan Kang had wanted to come play with Murong Qi Qi. He didn\u2019t expect that the moment he arrived at Long Autumn palace\u2019s entrance, he would encounter Xia Yun Xi. Previously, Wanyan Kang had seen Xia Yun Xi at White Cloud Restaurant. He knew this woman was very good at pretending. Now, seeing her wait at Long Autumn palace, Wanyan Kang became vigilant. Could it be that Xia Yun Xi had come looking for trouble with Murong Qi Qi?</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t know Wanyan Kang, but after seeing the silver dragon on his clothes, she guessed that he was a prince. However, she wasn\u2019t sure which one he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at, ugly thing?!\u201d Wanyan Kang saw Xia Yun Xi smiling at him, and he humphed lightly. He raised his head, stepped into Long Autumn palace and didn\u2019t bother with Xia Yun Xi anymore.</p><br/><p>After being called an \u2018ugly thing\u2019 by the other party, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s smile froze on her face. Her nose got sore. She almost cried.</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t a national grace and divine fragrance, but in any case, she\u2019s sweet and lovable. When people saw her, they would love her. When flowers saw her, they would blossom. At Dong Lu, the men who fell for her could take up a whole row from the east to the west. She didn\u2019t expect that after coming here, she would be called an \u2018ugly thing\u2019. How could Xia Yun Xi accept this?</p><br/><p>National grace and divine fragrance: outstanding beauty</p><br/><p>Women, regardless of being beautiful or ugly, all cared about their appearance. Not to mention, a \u2018cut above others\u2019 princess like Xia Yun Xi. How could she allow others to say such a thing about her? She followed with big steps and grabbed Wanyan Kang, \u201cWho did you call an ugly thing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBah, bah!\u201d Wanyan Kang jumped and broke free from Xia Yun Xi\u2019s hands. \u201cAside from you, who else could be so ugly? Really didn\u2019t see someone who\u2019s so unaware of themselves like you before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Earlier, Xia Yun Xi thought that maybe Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t know her, maybe he was in a bad mood. That\u2019s why he had said such words. But now, the other party was even more certain that she was the ugly thing, making Xia Yun Xi anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026how am I ugly?! Say! How am I ugly?!\u201d Although she usually pretended to be weak, but now it\u2019s the problem of protecting her \u2018face\u2019. Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t want to let Wanyan Kang off the hook like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, miss, being a girl, you should at least have some self-awareness, alright? Look at you, the eyebrows are deformed, the eyes are slanted, the nose is drooped and the mouth is crooked. You already look like this and still come out to disturb the city with your appearance. Being ugly is not your fault, but coming out to scare people is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Xia Yun Xi raised her hand towards Wanyan Kang. She didn\u2019t expect that, just as she\u2019s about to touch his face, the other party would flash and disappear in front of Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person is ugly; the temper is not good. It seems that no one would want you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang was in a very good mood after making Xia Yun Xi furious. Too lazy to bother with Xia Yun Xi, Wanyan Kang unhurriedly went to look for Murong Qi Qi. \u201cLittle cousin sister! Little cousin sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had long seen Wanyan Kang and also heard the dialogue between him and Xia Yun Xi. He really wished for the whole world to be in chaos. He had humiliated Dong Lu\u2019s princess like this. Now, after seeing the crying appearance of Xia Yun Xi, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s boredom from before was swept away. She directly went out to meet Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, you came, ah! You\u2019re too mean. I\u2019ve already moved in here for two days. But you only came to see me now! I thought that you would come yesterday to congratulate on my house-moving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice let Xia Yun Xi wake up from Wanyan Kang\u2019s humiliation, grief and indignation. That\u2019s right, it was this voice, this woman who\u2019d humiliated her at White Cloud Restaurant\u2019s arena\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but look at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Never mind that it was just one look, but it made Xia Yun Xi freeze in place. That girl was so pure, like a fairy who had fallen into the mortal realm. A faint smile was in her beautiful eyes. White jade-like nose. Petal-like lips. Between her eyebrows was a blood red cinnabar mole, making her originally perfect face even more breathtaking.</p><br/><p>Looking again, the attitude Wanyan Kang spoke with Murong Qi Qi was completely different from his attitude towards her. Xia Yun Xi finally understood why Wanyan Kang would call her an ugly thing. Because, in front of Murong Qi Qi, she really can only be regarded as such.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a sense of humiliation entered her heart! Accompanied by complex emotions like envy, jealousy and hate; all these feelings filled Xia Yun Xi\u2019s heart. No wonder the world spread rumors that Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Zhen Guo was the number one beauty of the world. This number one title was well-deserved.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I come today?!\u201d Wanyan Kang acted as though he was performing magic. He took out a bright case and handed it to Murong Qi Qi, \u201cThis is my gift for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi opened the bright case. Inside laid an egg-sized colorful stone. The sunlight fell on the stone and it emitted colors like the rainbow, dazzling people\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo beautiful!\u201d Murong Qi Qi took out the colorful stone and looked at it while facing the son, \u201cCousin brother, there\u2019s a rainbow inside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi liked it, Wanyan Kang was very happy. He moved closer to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cLittle cousin sister, using this as dowry for Su Mei, do you think it would work?\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that he had brought over this colorful stone to please her (MQQ). It was because of Su Mei, ah! She glanced once at Su Mei behind her. Murong Qi Qi chuckled, \u201cWould work! This gift is original. I like it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then, that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s brow wrinkled slightly and she pretended to be in a very difficult position, \u201cYou need to ask the opinion of the involved party, ah! You didn\u2019t even propose; how do you know if she\u2019s willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice was very small. Only the few people surrounding her could hear her words. Su Mei saw that Murong Qi Qi was making fun of her, she stomped, \u201cMiss, if you\u2019re like this, I will ignore you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Murong Qi Qi put away the bright case. \u201cI can only say, you passed my bar. The rest is on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi and Wanyan Kang\u2019s talking and laughing appearance made Xia Yun Xi\u2019s heart feel even more uneven. Why did this man directly curse her as an \u2018ugly thing\u2019 and also treating Murong Qi Qi so good? Could it be that he was attracted by Murong Qi Qi\u2019s appearance?</p><br/><p>Then, what kind of feelings does Feng Cang have for Murong Qi Qi? He wouldn\u2019t forget the appropriate ways of conduct and their identity of siblings because of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s appearance, right?!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Xia Yun Xi went forward and smiled at Murong Qi Qi, \u201cPrincess Zhen Guo let bengong1 wait for a long time, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi looked at Xia Yun Xi as if she had never seen this person before. Her expression was so real that even Xia Yun Xi began to doubt if that person at White Cloud Restaurant that day was really Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, princess, this slave forgot to tell you! This is Dong Lu\u2019s princess Yun. She came just now to ask to see princess. It was just\u2026the moment fifth highness appeared, this slave forgot to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei directly pushed this matter to Wanyan Kang. Wanyan Kang looked once at Xia Yun Xi. His nose was raised to the sky once again, \u201cLittle cousin sister, you know her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Murong Qi Qi shook her head very cooperatively.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have dealings with people you don\u2019t know. Who knows how the character of the other party is?! Little cousin sister is so pure. What to do if you come in contact with people of unknown origin, proximity to pitch makes you black, and become bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Proximity to pitch makes you black: different environments provide different influence</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang had long been aware of Xia Yun Xi pestering Feng Cang. Towards such a smelly fly who wanted to destroy Feng Cang and Murong Q Qi, Wanyan Kang would have no mercy. He immediately saw her as the object of attack and fried her madly and violently.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s poisonous tongue made Murong Qi Qi want to laugh, but she had to pretend and looked innocently at Xia Yun Xi. Then she looked at Wanyan Kang, \u201cCousin brother, is it really like that? She doesn\u2019t seem like a bad person, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne may know a person for a long time without understanding his true nature. Little cousin sister, you can\u2019t judge a person by appearance. I\u2019m a few years older than you and ate a little more salt than you. That is why my eyes are a bit brighter than yours. In short, if you can\u2019t determine the character of the other person, don\u2019t have any dealings with him/her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026I know.\u201d Murong Qi Qi nodded, acting well-behaved. The echoes of the two people made Xia Yun Xi so angry, she almost fainted.</p><br/><p>What is calling a person of unknown origin and the character is not determined? She, a dignified Dong Lu princess, had actually been talked about like this by Wanyan Kang! If this place was Dong Lu, even if Wanyan Kang had ten heads, he would\u2019ve long been dragged out and beheaded.</p><br/><p>Although Xia Yun Xi wished she could chop down Wanyan Kang\u2019s head and kick it as a ball, but she couldn\u2019t in front of Murong Qi Qi; besides, Wanyan Kang was a prince of Bei Zhou and these two people have a deep relation with Feng Cang, she couldn\u2019t destroy her image and therefore, must endure.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong is not the bad guy. Presumably, fifth highness and princess Zhen Guo still don\u2019t know me. Bengong is Dong Lu\u2019s princess Yun, Xia Yun Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026,\u201d hearing Xia Yun Xi introduce herself like this, Wanyan Kang seemed like he had suddenly realized something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the princess Yun who recently moved into Nan Lin wangfu,2 ah? Haha, that, sorry for just now, ah. I thought you\u2019re a concubine from the palace! You don\u2019t know, my emperor father really loves princess Zhen Guo. So, there are always some concubines who want to worm their way into being friends with princess Zhen Guo. They wanted to get the opportunity of my emperor father\u2019s view in a new light through princess Zhen Guo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, if you didn\u2019t say it just now, I would\u2019ve thought that you\u2019re like those jealous women of the harem! I\u2019m sorry, ah. It seemed that I misunderstood! I\u2019m sorry, ah, that\u2026what kind of princess again?! Aiya, my memory isn\u2019t good and I can\u2019t remember. Troubling you to repeat it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s ingratiatingly naughty smile made Xia Yun Xi wish that she could rush to him and give him a slap. What does he mean? Is he ridiculing her? Patience, patience; for Feng Cang, she needed to endure this. Take revenge in the future!</p><br/><p>Forcing down the anger in her heart, Xia Yun Xi smiled slightly, \u201cBengong is Dong Lu\u2019s princess Yun, Xia Yun Xi. Troubling your highness to remember it. Bengong doesn\u2019t like to repeat the second time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, she put on the airs of a princess! A corner of Wanyan Kang\u2019s mouth raised. His smile was full of mocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing, standing here?\u201d Just as a strange atmosphere appeared, Wanyan Yi\u2019s voice floated over. Ever since he\u2019d discussed with Lin Ke Xin, he had been wanting to create a false amorous impression with Murong Qi Qi for the crowd, so Wanyan Yi decided to come every day to Long Autumn palace.</p><br/><p>Today was the first time. He didn\u2019t expect that he would meet Xia Yun Xi here. Plus, the fact that her expression looked as though she\u2019d suffered much, making Wanyan Yi couldn\u2019t help but look at Murong Qi Qi and Wanyan Kang. In the end, which one of them had bullied this little poor thing?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi quickly captured the questioning look in Wanyan Yi\u2019s eyes. Then, she saw the way that Wanyan Yi looked at Xia Yun Xi was very different, making Murong Qi Qi suddenly realise something. Could it be that Wanyan Yi has feelings for Xia Yun Xi? A slag man with a slag woman, really a match made in heaven!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, we didn\u2019t do anything! I came looking for little cousin sister to celebrate her house-moving. Big brother, did you also come for this? Did you bring a gift?\u201d Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t like the way Wanyan Yi had looked at him. He didn\u2019t do anything, so why was Wanyan Yi\u2019s eyes full of accusation?</p><br/><p>After Wanyan Kang said that, Wanyan Yi took out a long box and handed it to Murong Qi Qi, \u201cCongratulations, little cousin sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei took the box and opened it. Inside laid a gold embedded jade. It was very valuable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, cousin brother! Second cousin brother, please come inside! Princess Yun, please come inside!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party had already come to her door. Plus, there were the two Wanyan brothers. Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t drive Xia Yun Xi away. She simply let the three come inside.</p><br/><p>This was the first time in more than ten years that Wanyan Yi had entered Long Autumn palace. Ever since this Long Autumn palace had become Wanyan Lie\u2019s pampered consort\u2019s exclusive ground; aside from Wanyan Lie, Jing De and Jing De\u2019s people, he (WL) didn\u2019t allow others to come inside this palace.</p><br/><p>From the moment Wanyan Yi entered, he looked directly at the furnishings.</p><br/><p>With one look, it made Wanyan Yi surprised. Presumably, all the treasures had been brought here by Wanyan Lie. The whole chamber, no matter if it was the cups to drink tea or the chairs, not to mention those decorations, which one wasn\u2019t a premium product?</p><br/><p>With only one glance, Wanyan Yi affirmed that Murong Qi Qi held a very high position in Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart. So much that she\u2019d surpassed Feng Cang. The empress didn\u2019t even enjoy the treatment of here.</p><br/><p>It seemed that consort mother was right. As long as he gets Murong Qi Qi, he would be able to get the throne!</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because he had personally come to Long Autumn palace, Wanyan Yi wouldn\u2019t have known the luxury of this place and also wouldn\u2019t have been so willing to pursue Murong Qi Qi. Now, after seeing Wanyan Lie\u2019s pampering, Wanyan Yi finally became determined to fight for the throne.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi was a royal princess. She had grown up in the palace and had seen many treasures. So, after she swept her gaze over the treasures here, she was also surprised. It seemed that the rumors from outside weren\u2019t false. This princess Zhen Guo really had gotten the favor of Bei Zhou\u2019s emperor.</p><br/><p>Originally, Xia Yun Xi wanted to come and have a talk between girls with Murong Qi Qi and worm her way into being friends with her (MQQ). Then, she could get closer to Murong Qi Qi and let her (MQQ) support her (XYX) in becoming Nan Lin wangfei!3 Then, give her some benefits, which would tempt Murong Qi Qi and she would have to help her (XYX). However, Wanyan Kang and Wanyan Yi suddenly appeared, ruining her plan completely and making Xia Yun Xi very angry.</p><br/><p>These two people are really hateful! The way Xia Yun Xi looked at Wanyan Kang was full of disgust. She also passed this sentiment to Wanyan Yi, making Wanyan Yi bewildered. When had he offended Xia Yun Xi?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi and Xia Yun Xi sat opposite of Wanyan Yi. He compared the two for half a day and felt that Lin Ke Xin was right. Although Xia Yun Xi could evoke the sense of protection from men, but Murong Qi Qi let people want to conquer her even more. Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t have the aura to be the mother of a country, but Murong Qi Qi had it.</p><br/><p>Although in Wanyan Yi\u2019s heart, he liked Murong Qi Qi more, but he didn\u2019t want to give up on Xia Yun Xi like this. Not to mention her identity and the Dong Lu behind her, her delicate face alone would make a heroic feeling rise in his heart.</p><br/><p>When he gets the throne, he must prove to Xia Yun Xi that he is a thousand, ten thousand times better than Feng Cang; make her become hell bent in love with him and surrender under his body.</p><br/><p>The originally liveliness became awkward because of Wanyan Yi\u2019s appearance. Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t have anything to do other than stare at Su Mei and give her winks. From Wanyan Yi\u2019s perspective, Wanyan Kang was giving Murong Qi Qi flirtatious winks.</p><br/><p>Hateful! Inside his sleeves, Wanyan Yi clenched his fists tightly. Wanyan Kang really got the thought of fighting for the throne with him. This brother is not worthy of having!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was too lazy to dispel this awkwardness. She\u2019d rather drink tea leisurely so she also didn\u2019t speak to break this dull atmosphere. Soon, Xia Yun Xi couldn\u2019t sit any longer, so she got up and left. Wanyan Yi also followed after her. When only Wanyan Kang was left, Murong Qi Qi let a long sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, did the same mother really give birth to you and Wanyan Yi? Why do I feel that the gaze of this big brother of yours is very gloomy!\u201d Remembering once again how Lin Ke Xin looked at Wanyan Kang at the previous banquet, Murong Qi Qi was somewhat worried for Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>Although this fifth prince trifled without respect, but he put importance on relationships and friendships. He\u2019s many times better than that hypocritical Wanyan Yi. Everyone knew that Lin Ke Xin was biased in love towards her eldest son. If she hurt Wanyan Kang due to helping her eldest son get the throne, then as Wanyan Kang\u2019s friend, Murong Qi Qi wouldn\u2019t leave the matter at that.</p><br/><p>Knowing that Murong Qi Qi was worried for him, Wanyan Kang smiled naughtily, \u201cCousin-in-law, instead of worrying about me, you better think of how to deal with Xia Yun Xi! The pestering skills of this woman is the strongest that I\u2019ve ever seen. If she plays dirty tricks, what should you and cousin brother do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t mind about what Wanyan Kang said. The quickest way to solve a problem was to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots. Her most important task now was to let Wanyan Ming Yue wake up. She didn\u2019t have the energy to deal with Xia Yun Xi. When Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s problem gets solved, then that would be Xia Yun Xi\u2019s time of death.</p><br/><p>1.

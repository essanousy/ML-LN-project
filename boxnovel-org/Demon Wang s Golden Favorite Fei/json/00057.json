Wangye1, you have to believe me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the hatred in Longze Jing Tian\u2019s eyes, Murong Xin Lian hastened to defend herself.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Xin Lian\u2019s outstretched hand to touch his sleeve, Longze Jing Tian waved and pushed her away.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet away\u2026\u2026don\u2019t disgust benwang2!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How can Murong Xin Lian accept that the man who just smiled gently at her is now looking at her full of disgust?</p><br/><p>No! This is all Murong Qi Qi\u2019s trick. Murong Qi Qi hates her for entering Jing wangfu3. Now she wants to sabotage her and Longze Jing Tian! She can\u2019t let Murong Qi Qi\u2019s evilness succeed!</p><br/><p>Not being able to move Longze Jing Tian, Murong Xin Lian can only put all her anger on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s accomplice\u2026\u2026Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui, I treated you well. Why did you go along with Murong Qi Qi to frame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, what are you saying? You did so many things against the conscience, can it be that you aren\u2019t afraid of lightening or retribution?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui\u2019s eyes were red and swollen. She cried very pitifully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day, you wanted to kill me. Eldest young master was also there. If princess doesn\u2019t believe, you can ask eldest young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally Murong Tai didn\u2019t believe in these. He firmly believed that it\u2019s just Murong Qi Qi wanting to take Murong Xin Lian down. He wanted to help his second daughter, but Fei Cui mentioned his eldest son. He was a bit hesitant and couldn\u2019t help but look at Murong Jun next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Fei Cui said is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun stood up and told everything that happened that day.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian totally didn\u2019t expect that Murong Jun who normally looked down at Murong Qi Qi the most, at this time will stood at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side and bite herself in the back. Why is it like that? Why does Murong Jun want to help that rubbish Murong Qi Qi?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all making trouble for me? Why are you slandering me? Murong Qi Qi what motive do you have? Why is even big brother being bribed by you and help you lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian still didn\u2019t forget to attack her. Murong Qi Qi sighed: \u201cSecond big sister, we don\u2019t have injustice or animosity between us. Why do you hate me so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words brought back all the memories in Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>Why? Why! No matter what the reason is, she just hates Murong Qi Qi. Hate her for obviously being a rubbish, but because of her noble birth, she can get a good marriage. That\u2019s why she hates everything about Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>Now, her beautiful dream is about to come true, but before Murong Qi Qi left she made such a scene. Why does this Murong Qi Qi always ruin her matters? Can it be that the heavens send Murong Qi Qi to strain her?</p><br/><p>Seeing Longze Jing Tian\u2019s frost like eyes, Murong Xin Lian\u2019s last string of reasoning collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I just despise you! I hate you! Aside from having a mother from a noble birth who gave you a noble identity, you are nothing. You are obviously a rubbish, but because of your noble blood, you can become Jing wangfei4. What do you have to get that position? I let Fei Cui spread those rumors. I also told princess many bad things about you. All of these are done by me! I had a hard time, I\u2019ll also let you have a hard time!\u201d</p><br/><p>People were stunned by Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hysteria.</p><br/><p>The truth came out. No matter how stupid Longze Yu Er is, she understood the whole story. If it wasn\u2019t because Murong Xin Lian inciting, confusing the right and the wrong to let her believe those rumors about Murong Qi Qi, she wouldn\u2019t have become such a big joke today!</p><br/><p>A country\u2019s princess was being played by a woman from the illegitimate line. Being used and also lost face in front of the envoys of the three countries. Even more, she let Longze Yu lost the Tai Sui. Because of this she also became the laughing stock of the high society. All of these are things Longze Yu Er couldn\u2019t accept.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Xin Lian, bengong5 will kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The just humiliated Longze Yu Er drew out a sword and rushed in Murong Xin Lian\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>The sword\u2019s silver glance stimulated Murong Xin Lian\u2019s nerves and also let her woke up. Heavens! What did she just say? How come she confessed? Why is it that when her eyes met Murong Qi Qi\u2019s, her mind became blank?</p><br/><p>Having no time to think all of these through, Murong Xin Lian dodged the oncoming sword. Seeing Murong Xin Lian dodge, Longze Yu Er became angrier. She immediately pushed her inner energy. Her body was immediately surrounded by orange color.</p><br/><p>The other has the intention to kill. For self-protection, Murong Xin Lian was also forced to use her inner energy. She was immediately wrapped b a circle of yellow light.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ping, Ping!\u2019</p><br/><p>Sword and whip clashed in the air. Two graceful figures were also intertwined in the air. The places where they touch were be ruined. Others screamed and dodged, afraid to being hurt by those two. For a time, the imperial garden was a chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cRebel, rebel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu\u2019s beard shook in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop them for zhen6! Quickly!</p><br/><p>Longze Yu\u2019s words just fell, the two figures rushed towards the royal concubines. Then a scream was heard. Murong Xue Lian knelt on the ground, holding her belly. Under her legs was bright red.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmp, emperor, save chenqie\u2019s7 child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu was also anxious. He hastily rushed to Murong Xue Lian and held her hand tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial physician! Get the imperial physician!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian\u2019s face was pale. Her slender left hand clutched her gown. Feeling the warm flow moving in the lower part of her body, Murong Xue Lian was in horror. This child is the root for her to settle down, ah! Nothing must happen!</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, save our child! I beg you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The beauty\u2019s cry and the unstoppable bleeding, made Longze Yu\u2019s expression became livid.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarn! Tie them up for zhen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before people could separate Murong Xin Lian and Longze Yu Er, they heard a loud noise. Longze Yu Er felt straight to the ground. Her face color was purple. Around her neck was Murong Xin Lian\u2019s whip.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing stumbled to Longze Yu Er, but found out that she already passed away!</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Dong\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>At the other side, Murong Xin Lian also knelt on the ground. Blood stained her lower part of the body, but the blood has already become black.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy child! My child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian grabbed the dress on her belly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy child!\u201d</p><br/><p>For a time, the court was in chaos. All the imperial physicians rushed to the imperial garden. The other people stood at a distance. They didn\u2019t even dare to breath loudly, because Longze Yu\u2019s expression is already very very bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, pardon us. The prince couldn\u2019t be kept\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, pardon us, princess is gone\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, pardon us. Ce wangfei 8 had a miscarriage\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One after another bad news hit Longze Yu. When she heard that the unborn child couldn\u2019t be kept, Murong Xue Lian exclaimed and then fainted. The imperial physician immediately rushed forward and let her swallow ginseng tablets. After a long time, Murong Xue Lian slowly woke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu was very sad for losing the child. He really looked forward for this child to come into this world. He hadn\u2019t thought that the child will be lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian heartbrokenly leaned against Longze Yu\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, you must definitely take revenge for our child!

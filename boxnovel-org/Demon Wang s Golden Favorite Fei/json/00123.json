When he found out that Murong Qi Qi was great general and princess\u2019s daughter, Feng Qi was the most excited one out of everyone.</p><br/><p>As one of the few people who knew Feng Cang\u2019s true identity, Feng clan\u2019s only blood Murong Qi Qi being found; to this Feng clan\u2019s elder, this was the happiest and also most exciting thing.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s emergence meant that the originally cut off Feng clan\u2019s bloodline could continue. Feng family has a descendant! How could this not let a person, who was born in Feng family, grow up in Feng family and was loyal to Feng family generation after generation, not be happy?!</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Feng\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi knew the hearts of these people and also didn\u2019t reject them anymore. Under Feng Qi\u2019s escort, she arrived at the front hall.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s Jing De was respectfully waiting there. Seeing Murong Qi Qi come out and looking at her stunning face, Jing De almost lost his soul. After just a moment, Jing De became aware of his disrespect. He quickly lowered his head and held out the imperial edict.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor said, this is princess\u2019s. You don\u2019t need to bow and this slave also doesn\u2019t need to read it out. Princess can open it directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi opened the imperial edict. On it was nothing more than rewards and also the recovery of her surname. Wanyan Lie seemed to respect Murong Qi Qi\u2019s thoughts very much. He personally asked in the imperial edict for her opinion; asking her what name she wanted to be called by.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince mother struggled to give birth to me on the seventh of the seventh month, I will still be called Qi Qi!\u201d Feng Qi Qi, this name is not bad! Murong Qi Qi was thinking in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Jing De quickly wrote it down.</p><br/><p>Looking once more, Wanyan Lie bestowed her the Long Autumn palace. Murong Qi Qi softly read it,\u201d Long Autumn palace? Didn\u2019t consort Yue live there? I won\u2019t live there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang, who was at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side, when he heard emperor father rewarded Long Autumn palace to Murong Qi Qi, his heart skipped a beat. Through generations, Long Autumn palace had been the residence of the empress. It\u2019s the place which received the most imperial grace in the harem. What did emperor father mean by doing this? Could it be that emperor father wanted to hold Murong Qi Qi in a high light\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, consort Yue is already gone. The emperor let people clean up Long Autumn palace as the residence of princess\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want!\u201d Murong Qi Qi shook her head. \u201cI want to live at Nan Lin wangfu!1 I won\u2019t live elsewhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it was like how emperor guessed it; Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t want to live in the palace and wanted to stay at Nan Lin wangfu. However, the emperor\u2019s meaning is\u2026Jing De swallowed, \u201cPrincess, emperor\u2019s meaning is that you can occasionally stay at the palace for a while and can then rest at Long Autumn palace. Long Autumn palace is honorable and glorious. It\u2019s the most beautiful wing in the palace and is most suitable for princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStaying for a while in the palace, I can stay at grandmother\u2019s. Go back and tell emperor uncle, I don\u2019t want Long Autumn palace! A place where people had died, bad luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words scared Jing De; he almost bit his tongue. Which woman doesn\u2019t want to live in Long Autumn palace and become the mistress of Long Autumn palace? It so happened that this princess used a \u2018go back\u2019 to make him leave.</p><br/><p>When Jing De returned to the palace, inside the imperial study, he repeated Murong Qi Qi\u2019s exact words back to Wanyan Lie. Also, his heart was disturbed. He was worried that Wanyan Lie would flip out. He didn\u2019t expect that after he waited for a long time, he would hear Wanyan Lie\u2019s laughter, \u201cHahahaha! Indeed Ming Yue\u2019s daughter! Indeed zhen\u2019s2 niece! Great! Great!\u201d</p><br/><p>After following Wanyan Lie for so long, Jing De could distinguish when his master was happy and when his master was angry. Hearing his laughter, Wanyan Lie must really like that princess Zhen Guo. It seemed that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s days of wealth is yet to come!</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, then this Long Autumn palace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep it! Let people clean both the inside and the outside. Send a group of new people to take care of it. They need to be well-behaved and obedient! Zhen is the son of heaven, I opened my golden mouth and spoke jade words. Long Autumn palace is Murong Qi Qi\u2019s home of her mother\u2019s side. She can come anytime she wants!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t know why, but from Wanyan Lie\u2019s voice, Jing De heard a never before pampering. It was just, it was the thought of the emperor, he didn\u2019t dare to guess it. It would be good if he only did his job.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie rewarding Murong Qi Qi with Long Autumn palace, was immediately like a bomb, causing a great commotion among the women of the harem.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! His majesty gave Long Autumn palace to Murong Qi Qi?\u201d When Lin Ke Xin heard this news, she was stunned. Originally, she thought that since Yue Lan Zhi died, this Long Autumn palace would fall into her hands. She didn\u2019t expect that Wanyan Lie would change hands and give it to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cNiangniang,3 princess Zhen Guo has already restored her original surname. Now, she\u2019s Feng Qi Qi!\u201d Wet nurse Yu stood next to Lin Ke Xin. She quickly massaged her (LKX) back to let her calm down.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang\u2026\u2019 Lin Ke Xin threw the teacup on the ground, \u201cBengong4 doesn\u2019t care who or what she is. Wet nurse, what kind of place is Long Autumn palace? That\u2019s the place where the empress lives since the beginning of the history, ah! Tell me, what does the emperor mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin\u2019s anger was in the expectation of wet nurse Yu. She quickly said, \u201cThis slave doesn\u2019t dare guess the emperor\u2019s meaning.\u201d However, in her heart she was thinking, since you know this is the place where only the empress can live, why should you be concerned about it?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Lin Ke Xin gritted her teeth. The handkerchief in her hand had already been twisted into a rope. \u201cWet nurse, tell me, is the emperor telling everyone that the next emperor\u2019s empress is Feng Qi Qi and that there\u2019s no need to doubt it? In other words, the one who gets Feng Qi Qi is the next emperor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Lin Ke Xin say that, wet nurse Yu thought for a while and then nodded, \u201cNiangniang, you\u2019re right! Perhaps, this truly is the emperor\u2019s meaning! It\u2019s niangniang who\u2019s thoughtful and could understand the emperor\u2019s meaning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wet nurse Yu\u2019s bootlicking let Lin Ke Xin\u2019s mood got a bit better, \u201cSend someone to ask fifth prince if princess accepted the invitation. Then, let someone invite second prince into the palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>In Jingxin Hall, Lin Ke Xin was calculating how to let Wanyan Yi get Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart. Inside Jingde palace, Li Bing also threw over the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Autumn palace? Is that a place where a little girl can afford to live in?! Why doesn\u2019t she ponder her own weight?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNiangniang, it\u2019s said, princess Zhen Guo rejected. Princess said, people died at that place and it\u2019s unlucky. She won\u2019t live there!\u201d Li Bing\u2019s maid Chun Tao reported every news she inquired to Li Bing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor didn\u2019t get angry?\u201d After Li Bing heard this, she quickly asked what happened after.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Chun Tao shook her head, \u201cAfter hearing it, emperor was very happy. He also said that princess is very like princess Ming Yue. Then, he also insisted on leaving Long Autumn palace for her. He said that in the future, Long Autumn palace is princess Zhen Guo\u2019s maternal home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaternal home, maternal home\u2026,\u201d Li Bing muttered these two words. Suddenly, Li Bing\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cBengong understands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that her master had a face full of excitement, Chun Tao was puzzled, \u201cNiangniang, what did you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor wants to cement old ties by marriage. He wants to let princess Zhen Guo become his daughter-in-law\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Li Bing thought about it, the more feasible was it. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s already at a marriageable age. Naturally, she should get married. Wanyan Lie pampers Murong Qi Qi so much; he certainly wishes for his son marry her. Then, who is the most suitable candidate?</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Autumn palace, Long Autumn palace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Bing muttered twice. Suddenly, she realized, \u201cLong Autumn palace is the symbol of the main palace of the harem. Feng Qi Qi entered the main palace of the harem, then this means, her husband is the new emperor! It must be like this! In the past, emperor loved princess Ming Yue very much. Now, he also loves the house and its crow. Naturally, he loves Feng Qi Qi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Love the house and its crow: love everyone/everything connected to the one you love. Love me, love my dog</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, didn\u2019t he always say that he wished to have a daughter like princess Ming Yue and would give her the best things in the world? Now, princes Zhen Guo is found. The emperor would certainly pamper her to the extreme. For a woman, in this world, the noblest place is the position of the empress. That must be it! That must be it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Tao looked at the empress\u2019s spirited looks. She (CT) probably guessed the meaning behind it. \u201cNiangniang, Jingxin hall over there entrusted fifth prince to invite princess Zhen Gu for tea!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTea?\u201d Hearing Lin Ke Xin\u2019s doings, Li Bing sneered, \u201cFeng Qi Qi got the emperor\u2019s favor. She would be extremely honorable, why would she care for a cup of tea?!</p><br/><p>Li Bing called Chun Tao to her side. She whispered a few words in her ears. Chun Tao nodded and left Jingde palace immediately.</p><br/><p>Inside Jinxuan palace, after Dongfang Lan heard Wanyan Lie\u2019s decision, she said \u2018muddleheaded\u2019 two times. She could understand Wanyan Lie\u2019s love for Murong Qi Qi, but like this, is it not letting Murong Qi Qi become a delicious cake everyone wanted to covet?</p><br/><p>\u201cCould the emperor not know that him doing this will deepen the contradiction between the princes?! Besides, aijia5 doesn\u2019t want her to enter the imperial family. Aijia only want her to be happy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Dongfang Lan talk till here, Qing Gu sent the other palace maids away. She came to Dongfang Lan\u2019s side, \u201cMiss, there is something this slave doesn\u2019t know if this slave should say it or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Gu being like this, Dongfang Lan guessed that is must be something important. She immediately nodded, \u201cTell me, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Gu gestured with her hand and led a quick-witted little palace maid to Dongfang Lan. When the little palace saw Dongfang Lan, she immediately kowtowed, \u201cEmpress dowager, our niangniang is innocent! Our niangniang didn\u2019t attack the emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is\u2026\u201d Seeing this unfamiliar palace maid in front of her eyes, Dongfang Lan was somewhat puzzled. Who is this palace maid? Why did she cry out grievances the moment she came?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, she\u2019s palace maid Chun Xing from Long Autumn palace\u2019s\u2026who served noble consort Yue.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that yesterday, when Qing Gu went to visit the injured Wanyan Lie, she saw a girl who looked like Wanyan Ming Yue. Although the girl was killed by Jing De, but this let a suspicion grew in Qing Gu\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, in the morning, when Wanyan Lie woke up, he ordered the death of all people of Long Autumn palace. Qing Gu saw that the situation was far from good. In the end, she played a small trick and saved Chun Xing. Now, she brought her to Dongfang Lan.</p><br/><p>Chun Xing\u2019s eyes were red like apricots. Her voice was choked and her eyes were full of fright. Seeing the pitiful state of the little palace maid, Dongfang Lan let her stand up to answer her questions. However, Chun Xing refused to get up and only shouted innocence for Yue Lan Zhi.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur niangniang was good-tempered. Usually, she was never willing to punish a servant. Even if this slave does something wrong, niangniang was still pleasant and wouldn\u2019t even say some harsh words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, now, suddenly there isn\u2019t even a shadow of niangniang. Outside, everyone is searching to catch niangniang and said that she attacked the emperor, but this slave doesn\u2019t believe it! Empress dowager, this slave is willing to use this slave\u2019s life to guarantee that imperial noble consort is certainly not such a person! Every time, when she saw the emperor, she was like a mouse seeing a cat; how would she have the guts to attack the emperor?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dead Yue Lan Zhi would never have thought that the little palace maid, who only followed her not long ago would want to get justice for her in front of Dongfang Lan.</p><br/><p>After listening to Chun Xing, Dongfang Lan frowned. She had never seen Yue Lan Zhi. She only knew that recently she was the most favored consort in the palace.</p><br/><p>Since Wanyan Ming Yue and Feng Xie died, Dongfang Lan put her heart in Buddha teachings and didn\u2019t bother with the matters of the harem.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan also heard some things of the harem. It was nothing more than that Wanyan Lie would favor a new girl after some time and let the harem overflow with vinegar. But, she couldn\u2019t control these things and her heart didn\u2019t have someone she wanted to care about.</p><br/><p>Those matters of those women of the harem had nothing to do with her, an elder woman. So, no matter who Wanyan Lie favored, pampered or loved, Dongfang Lan was indifferent. Even if those consorts fiddle in front of her, she wouldn\u2019t intervene. Over time, those consorts didn\u2019t come to her for justice anymore and her ears got a lot quieter.</p><br/><p>Not to mention Yue Lan Zhi, even those other women Wanyan Lie pampered at Long Autumn palace, Dongfang Lan had seen none of them.</p><br/><p>Most of the time, she\u2019s at the temple. When she returns, she also likes it quiet. Moreover, Wanyan Lie seemed to particularly favor sickly beauties. All the mistresses of Long Autumn palace had been too weak to even stand up the wind. On hot days, they even wore a veil when coming out. So delicate, making Dongfang Lan dislike them even more. So, she was simply too lazy to summon those consorts lest those consorts have a weak body and became sick, making their feelings of mother and son separate.</p><br/><p>Now, hearing Chun Xing seek justice for Yue Lan Zhi and her demeanor didn\u2019t seem to be lying, Dongfang Lan nodded. She motioned for her to go on.</p><br/><p>Chun Xing choked and told Dongfang Lan one by one how afraid usually Yue Lan Zhi was of Wanyan Lie, how he humiliated her, how she had miscarriage and how every time Wanyan Lie would torture Yue Lan Zhi.</p><br/><p>When she heard Chun Xing say that Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s miscarriage was caused by Wanyan Lie\u2019s forced intercourse and besides, after the miscarriage, Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t bother with Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s physical discomfort and still had intercourse, Dongfang Lan was stunned. It was as if it was not the Wanyan Lie she knew. \u201cHow could the emperor do such a thing? How could this be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering empress dowager, ever word this slave said is the truth! The old imperial physician who had been treating niangniang can testify!\u201d Seeing Dongfang Lan doubting her words, Chun Xing got anxious and immediately kowtowed hard on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress dowager, imperial noble consort is really innocent! That day, after the emperor entered Long Autumn palace, this slave was worried that niangniang would call this slave, so I waited outside. However, imperial noble consort didn\u2019t come out again. Such a weak person like niangniang and also because the miscarriage her body was weak, how could she leave the palace on her own?! Even more, she couldn\u2019t have attacked the emperor. Asking empress dowager to inspect this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Xing wholeheartedly wanted to seek justice for her master. Her head knocked heavily on the ground. It didn\u2019t take long for her forehead to swollen. The skin broke. Blood streamed along Chun Xing\u2019s nose. Drop by drop, it fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Gu!\u201d Dongfang Lan gestured at Qing Gu. Qing Gu quickly pulled Chun Xing. She wanted to pull her up, but she didn\u2019t expect Chun Xing to be a stubborn girl. \u201cIf empress dowager doesn\u2019t accept Chun Xing\u2019s request, Chun Xing won\u2019t stand up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you rebelling now?!\u201d Dongfang Lan\u2019s palm slammed on the table, \u201cDo you want to threaten aijia? Aijia hates being threatened the most! Servants, drag this insensible palace maid out and beat her to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress dowager, imperial noble consort is really innocent! Asking empress dowager to please investigate! Empress dowager, why don\u2019t you think why in ten years, Long Autumn palace changed nine imperial noble consorts? Where did those women went to? Empress dowager, human life is beyond value, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Xing\u2019s plead didn\u2019t get Dongfang Lan\u2019s mercy. Although Qing Gu wanted to help Chun Xing, but the empress dowager issued an order; Qing Gu could only let people drag Chun Xing out. After a while, someone came to report that Chun Xing had been beaten to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cBury her!\u201d Dongfang Lan turned the Buddha beads in her hands. Her head was lowered for a long time. Qing Gu returned and nodded at Dongfang Lan. Only then, was she relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that child still well? Were you able to keep it a secret from everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only wound of the surface. After taking care of it for a while, she would get well. How did empress dowager know that our Jinxuan palace have the emperor\u2019s people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, under the whole heaven, every spot is the emperor\u2019s ground; to the borders of land, every individual is the emperor\u2019s minister. Everywhere is the emperor\u2019s, not to mention this palace!\u201d Dongfang Lan\u2019s hand paused at rolling the beads. \u201cQing Gu, you go and personally take care of Chun Xing. Don\u2019t let anyone find her. After this thing passed, aijia will personally ask her about Long Autumn palace\u2019s matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the imperial study, Jing De whispered a few words in Wanyan Lie\u2019s ears. Wanyan Lie put down the brush in his hand, \u201cOh? Empress dowager personally killed Chun Xing? Didn\u2019t see it wrongly? Are you sure she died?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering emperor, she has already died and stopped breathing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, it\u2019s good! Haha, didn\u2019t expect this girl to have a strong temper and actually reported at the empress dowager\u2019s\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, although empress dowager isn\u2019t your birth mother, but she treats you not badly! Besides, she never asks about the matters of the palace.\u201d After hearing Jing De\u2019s words, Wanyan Lie laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Empress mother is indeed not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Xing\u2019s matter, along with Wanyan Lie\u2019s words, had been forgotten by everyone. No one would remember that once in Long Autumn palace, there was such a palace maid. Also, no one would reprimand the empress dowager for sentencing a palace maid to death\u2026</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity was known, unexpectedly, there were no rumors and there was also no news against her. The public opinion was more against Li Qiu Shui. For a time, the battle of fifteen years ago at Yandang mountain was once again stirred. More people began to explore the deep reason behind Feng Xie\u2019s defeat. Of course, these were effectively initiated by the hidden initiator\u2026Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Inside Tingsong building, Murong Qi Qi leaned lazily against Feng Cang\u2019s arms. She looked for a comfortable position and laid down like a lazy cat.</p><br/><p>Although before, she\u2019d experienced those painful tangling, but after getting to know Feng Cang\u2019s true identity, Murong Qi Qi had the feeling of having pushed away all clouds and now able to see the moon. Her mood became cheerful. Plus, she won a bowl full of gold and silver from the gambling dens, of course her mood was good. She had been mumbling songs.</p><br/><p>Compared to Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang had been worried about one thing. That is the reason behind Wanyan Lie giving Murong Qi Qi Long Autumn palace. Especially the way Longze Jing Tian and Wanyan Hong looked at Murong Qi Qi in the hall, such possessiveness made him unhappy. He wished he could dig out those two\u2019s eyes!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye,6 what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seeing that Feng Cang hadn\u2019t spoken for half a day, Murong Qi Qi raised her head. Her hand pinched Feng Cang\u2019s chin, \u201cWhat are you thinking about, ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand and put it on his lips. He bit her fingers lightly, \u201cI\u2019m worried\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWorried?\u201d The moment she heard Feng Cang\u2019s words, her expression turned serious. She sat up and looked at Feng Cang, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

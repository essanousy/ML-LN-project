The sword in Xia Yun Xi\u2019s hand once again stabbed Wanyan Yi\u2019s lower body and cut down his **. It was this dirty thing that had brought calamity to her. It was he who had brought calamity to her!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Before Wanyan Yi died, he screamed tragically. \u2018Dong\u2026\u2019 Wanyan Yi knelt on the floor, full of blood. His forehead was sweaty. That kind of pain was a hundred, a thousand times more painful than the pain coming from his chest.</p><br/><p>At this time, Wanyan Yi finally understood that Xia Yun Xi truly hated him, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have been so cruel.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi er!\u201d1 Lin Ke Xin rushed over when her son fell. She pulled the brocade from her body and covered Wanyan Yi\u2019s body, \u201cYi er, don\u2019t be afraid. Consort mother is here. Consort mother is here! Imperial physician! Quickly summon the imperial physician!</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin\u2019s hands clutched Wanyan Yi\u2019s chest and wanted to block the hole to not let blood come out. However, this method had no effect. A short while later, her hands were covered red with blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort mother, it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s useless\u2026\u201d Blood flowed along Wanyan Yi\u2019s chin. His young life following the loss of this blood was also lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort mother, this subject son is not filial, can\u2019t\u2026be filial to you anymore\u2026this subject son regretted not listening to you\u2026consort mother\u2026\u201d Wanyan Yi\u2019s excitement made the blood flow faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk. Consort mother will certainly cure you! Don\u2019t talk, Yi er! Imperial physician! Imperial physician!\u201d Lin Ke Xin wiped her tears, but she stained her white face with blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort mother\u2026this subject son truly\u2026loves her\u2026asking consort mother\u2026don\u2019t make things difficult for Yun er\u2026it\u2019s this subject son who was wrong\u2026and took her innocence\u2026this subject son wronged her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end of life, Wanyan Yi actually pleaded for Xia Yun Xi. He knew that Xia Yun Xi assassinated him. Even if she\u2019s a Dong Lu\u2019s princess, Wanyan Lie would not let her off easily. Wanyan Yi didn\u2019t want anything to happen to Xia Yun Xi. After all, she got angry because of him.</p><br/><p>Seeing that till the end, Wanyan Yi still spoke for Xia Yun Xi, Lin Ke Xin\u2019s heart did more pain, \u201cYi er, don\u2019t talk anymore. Nothing will happen to you. Consort mother begs you! Don\u2019t talk, hold on. The imperial physician will arrive soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Yi\u2019s mouth twitched twice. His eyes tried hard to look at Xia Yun Xi. Her eyes only had hate. It seemed that this time, he really did wrong.</p><br/><p>The last impression that this world left Wanyan Yi was those eyes full of hate of Xia Yun Xi. Although, Wanyan Yi really wanted to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d to Xia Yun Xi, but his mouth tried hard to open, but not a sound came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi er, Yi er! Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding Wanyan Yi\u2019s body, Lin Ke Xin screamed painfully as if she eanted to shout all her grievances and feelings of oppression out.</p><br/><p>Just a short while, the things had undergone a dramatic turnaround, making those officials dumbfounded. Bei Zhou\u2019s prince raped Dong Lu\u2019s princess. In the end, he died at the hand of Dong Lu\u2019s princess. How should this matter be judged?</p><br/><p>Everyone was calculating if Wanyan Lie would held Xia Yun Xi responsible for Wanyan Yi\u2019s death or not. If he held her responsible, would Dong Lu\u2019s emperor Xia Jin agree? If by chance, this matter gets big, the two countries launched war, then what?</p><br/><p>The original beautiful marriage alliance in the end became a drama and a tragedy, making people couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the fickleness of the affairs of life.</p><br/><p>While everyone was worrying about if Xia Yun Xi could keep the head on her body, this involved party still looked full of hatred at Wanyan Yi\u2019s body. Even if he died, he still couldn\u2019t make up for the harm he caused her. If she could, Xia Yun Xi wished to eat his flesh to vent her anger.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere, because of Wanyan Yi\u2019s death become strangely quiet. The officials lowered their head or looked at their fingertips or looked at the belt of the person standing in front of them. No one spoke and no one dare to make a sound at this moment.</p><br/><p>A long period after Wanyan Yi\u2019s death, Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t spoke. The silence of the emperor let these officials who mixed in the court for many years became more scared and on edge. The royal scandal was seen by the officials; what would Wanyan Lie do. Was it to silence them or something else?</p><br/><p>The imperial garden had never been so quiet as today. Aside from Lin Ke Xin\u2019s sometimes loud and sometimes low crying, there was no other sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird senior brother, I\u2019m tired. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Finally, it was Xia Yun Xi who broke this piece of quietness. Although she wanted to go beg Feng Cang and explain that everything wasn\u2019t like what he saw, but Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s mind was blank. She couldn\u2019t think of why the matter would become like this! Obviously, it should be Feng Cang; why did it become Wanyan Yi? She didn\u2019t think that Wanyan Yi was so despicable and shameless. Even if he died ten thousand times is not enough to make up from her inner pain!</p><br/><p>Although her body still hurt very much, but now Xia Yun Xi only wanted to leave this place that made her feel so much shame. She didn\u2019t have the face to look at Feng Cang and didn\u2019t have even more face to stay at Bei Zhou. She wanted to leave here. The sooner the better.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jia Lan never imagined that things would turn out like this. In such a short period of time, such a big change happened. It seemed that he should sent Dong Lu a letter quickly. If this matter isn\u2019t dissolved, then it would become a national problem. After all, it was Xia Yun Xi who personally killed Wanyan Yi.</p><br/><p>Jia Lan was in the front. Xia Yun Xi was behind him. The two intended to leave the imperial garden.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026,\u201d Lin Ke Xin who was originally holding Wanyan Yi stood up. She stared at Xia Yun Xi\u2019s back and laughed coldly. In just a moment, Lin Ke Xin rushed to Xia Yun Xi like the wind. Don\u2019t know when, a dagger appeared in her hand. When Xia Yun Xi sensed something strange and turned around, Lin Ke Xin\u2019s dagger already entered Xia Yun Xi\u2019s abdomen.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Yi er likes you so much, then go down to keep him company!\u201d Lin Ke Xin revealed a crazy smile. She frantically pushed the dagger repeatedly in and then pulled it out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2019 Jia Lan\u2019s palm hit Lin Ke Xin\u2019s shoulder. Lin Ke Xin felt pain. The dagger in her hand fell on the ground. Jia Lan immediately stopped the bleeding for Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird senior brother, so cold\u2026,\u201d Xia Yun Xi was pale-faced and her lips trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>Jia Lan exercised his inner energy, wanting to heal Xia Yun Xi\u2019s injury, but he discovered that it was useless. Lin Ke Xin seemed to have used all the strength from her body on those few cuts. Even if god was here, he wouldn\u2019t be able to save Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng\u2026Cang\u2026,\u201d Xia Yun Xi wanted to look at Feng Cang, but she discovered that her eyelids were heavy and she was unable to open them. After saying Feng Cang\u2019s name for the last time, Xia Yun Xi closed her eyes. Her head fell in Jia Lan\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The body of the person in his arms was cold. Although Xia Yun Xi was a Penglai Island\u2019s disciple only by name, but after all she had to call him \u2018senior brother\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Seeing Xia Yun Xi like this, Lin Ke Xin laughed loudly. \u201cYi er, consort mother is afraid that you\u2019ll be lonely and sent her to you! Yi er, are you happy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin\u2019s hair was scattered. The blood and tears merged together on her face. Her eyes were full of sadness. Coupled with these sad words, it made people unable to hate this person.</p><br/><p>A life for a life. Wanyan Yi died at Xia Yun Xi\u2019s hands. Xia Yun Xi died at Lin Ke Xin\u2019s hands. All hatred should end with Xia Yun Xi\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, I want to take her back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan carried Xia Yun Xi and stood up. No matter what the outcome of this matter would be, now, Jia Lan only wanted to leave with Xia Yun Xi. At least, she should be buried at Dong Lu and not at Bei Zhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie gestured with his hands. So many things happened at a palace banquet making Wanyan Lie suddenly seem to be a lot older.</p><br/><p>Originally, Xia Yun Xi came to form a marriage alliance. It was a good thing. He didn\u2019t expect that in the end, it would end with two corpses. Wanyan Yi was indeed hateful, but his crime shouldn\u2019t have been punished with the death. Xia Yun Xi was indeed impulsive, but to take revenge for her son, wasn\u2019t Lin Ke Xin also an impulsive demon?!</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave, everyone, leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the mad Lin Ke Xin, Wanyan Lie gestured at the crowd, \u201cEveryone, leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long time, Wanyan Lie finally spoke, making the officials let out a sigh of relief. Emperor said to leave. Naturally everyone wished that a pair of wings could grow on their back and quickly leave.</p><br/><p>In just a moment, only a handful of people was left in the imperial garden.</p><br/><p>Those palace maids who had been humiliated by Wanyan Yi, at this time, they were dressed and stood in a row. Seeing that Wanyan Lie was looking at them, these palace maids shivered from being scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t say more nonsense. The next moment after his order, a person in black appeared. In a flash, these seven to eight palace maids didn\u2019t have a chance to scream, they fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>Looking at the redness spread on the ground, Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart was particularly heavy. Today, too many things had happened, making his mind somewhat blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing De, escort consort De back to Jingxin hall. Burry second prince. Zhen 2 is tired and want to rest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jing De let people support Lin Ke Xin to Jingxin hall. No matter what, she wouldn\u2019t let go of Wanyan Yi in her arms, \u201cYi er, don\u2019t be afraid. Consort mother is at your side. Consort mother will protect you! Yi er, sleep obediently. Don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor\u2026,\u201d The crazy Lin Ke Xin was a bit difficult for Jing De. He could only look at Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet her! Find someone to look over her. When she\u2019s tired, send her back to Jingxin hall!\u201d Wanyan Lie gestured with his hand, turned and left the imperial garden. His heart felt very heavy. Everything piled together and he had no way to digest it. It was as if something was struck in his throat, making him unbale to breath.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie slowly left. Jing De arranged everything and followed behind Wanyan Lie with small steps, \u201cEmperor, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhen wants to go to Long Autumn palace and see Ming Yue.\u201d Now, Wanyan Lie only wanted to see Wanyan Ming Yue as if only at her side, his heart would calm down.</p><br/><p>The moment Jing De heard that Wanyan Lie wanted to go to Long Autumn palace, he got anxious, \u201cEmperor, princess Zhen Guo lives at Long Autumn palace. If you go now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jing De\u2019s reminder made Wanyan Lie wake up. That\u2019s right, ah! Murong Qi Qi is living there. If he goes during the day, wouldn\u2019t it let people suspect? Forget it! Forget it! Wanyan Lie shook his head. Even if he wanted to find comfort at Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s, but now was not the right time. \u201cGo back! Zhen will go to the imperial study\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A palace banquet ended with Wanyan Yi\u2019s and Xia Yun Xi\u2019s death. Everyone was more concerned about what had happened at the imperial garden. No one paid attention to where Misha who appeared at the hall before, went to.</p><br/><p>When Jia Lan returned with Xia Yun Xi\u2019s body to the mansion where they were temporarily staying, Misha was carefully cutting Murong Qing Lian\u2019s nails. He bought a maid to help Murong Qing Lian bath. He also let the maid apply medicine on Murong Qing Lian\u2019s body and let her change Murong Qing Lian in new clothes. Now, Murong Qing Lian looked like a complete different person from the one from before. Finally, her original appearance could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian, don\u2019t be afraid! Big brother will protect you!\u201d Misha held a small scissor and cut the nails of Murong Qing Lian in a perfect arc. \u201cWhen you\u2019re better, big brother will help you take revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>This whole way, Murong Qing Lian had been held by Misha. Just now, after soaking in the warm water, Murong Qing Lian\u2019s confused mind gradually sobered up.</p><br/><p>Who was this person? Why would he use \u2018Lian\u2019 to address her? Murong Qing Lian looked motionless at the beautiful boy in front of her. Why couldn\u2019t she remember when she had seen this person? \u201cI only have one big brother, but he isn\u2019t you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian\u2019s words made Misha surprised for a moment. Then, he revealed a pure smile, \u201cLian, you only have one big brother and that is me, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy big brother is not as great as you!\u201d Murong Qing Lian shook her head, \u201cSo, you\u2019re not him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian, what happened in the past was my fault! But, please believe that this time, I won\u2019t treat you like before! I already regretted. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha didn\u2019t finish, when the door was opened. Jia Lan appeared in front of them while carrying Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, Yun Xi died.\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha looked at Xia Yun Xi in Jia Lan\u2019s arms. He revealed a strange smile, \u201cPeople are always going to die. You and I will also die one day. Don\u2019t need to be sad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s answer was outside of Jia Lan\u2019s expectations. Although Xia Yun Xi wasn\u2019t likeable, but after all, they could be considered to have come from the same master. Misha\u2019s answer was too cold and didn\u2019t have a human touch.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian, come, big brother will cut your nails for you!\u201d Leaving aside, Jia Lan and Xia Yun Xi, Misha continued to cut Murong Qing Lian\u2019s nails as if in his world, Murong Qing Lian was the most important.</p><br/><p>Seeing Misha like this, Jia Lan opened his mouth, but in the end, he still swallowed his words. The interaction of the two was caught by Murong Qing Lian\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Before, she had seen Jia Lan. At that time, Jia Lan saved her once at the tournament of the four countries from Murong Qi Qi. Besides, he said that he did it for someone else. Now, Jia Lan was together with Misha. Besides Misha said such inexplicable things; could it be that the person Jia Lan was referring to was Misha?</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian was certainly, definitely sure that she had never seen this person called Misha. She couldn\u2019t have any intersection with him. Misha had certainly mistaken her for the wrong person.</p><br/><p>Seeing Misha\u2019s beautiful face and the sincere smile on his face, Murong Qing Lian had some hesitation. This person was so good to her. Should she tell him that she\u2019s not the person he was looking for?</p><br/><p>If she told Misha that she\u2019s not his \u2018Lian\u2019, would he still take care of her with such gentleness?</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, in front of Murong Qing Lian\u2019s eyes suddenly appeared the situation in prison. Those whips beat her till her flesh lacerated. The old scars weren\u2019t healed yet, when new scars were added.</p><br/><p>If Misha knew that she wasn\u2019t \u2018Lian\u2019 and throws her back in prison, then what should she do? No! She didn\u2019t want it to be like that! She didn\u2019t want to live in that darkness anymore. She didn\u2019t want to live like an animal anymore!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although they didn\u2019t come from the same mother, but towards this little sister, normally Longze Jing Tian still spoil and love her. He has never been so stern with her. At this time, seeing a complete strange Longze Jing Tian, Longze Yu Er totally couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, benwang\u2019s1 imperial little sister talked irresponsibly. Asking Nan Lin wang2 and princess Zhao Yang for forgiveness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian turned around and apologized to Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi. He was hoping from the bottom of his heart that Feng Cang didn\u2019t hear those \u2018darn words\u2019 of Longze Yu Er. If Feng Cang believed those words and doesn\u2019t recognize this marriage, then Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reputation will be so bad that she will become the joke of everyone for the rest of her life!</p><br/><p>Now, Longze Jing Tian felt very remorseful. If he didn\u2019t break off the engagement, Murong Qi Qi wouldn\u2019t have to marry faraway and also won\u2019t cause her so much trouble because of the broken engagement. Thinking till here, the way Longze Jing Tian looked at Murong Qi Qi turned more remorseful.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang chuckled loudly. He reveled a beautiful smile. \u201cSince princess said there was, benwang thinks is better to investigate lest to let another slander benwang\u2019s wangfei3 again in the future. Today, taking this opportunity to let everything become clear!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Feng Cang\u2019s words, Longze Yu Er\u2019s spine also straightened. After all, what man doesn\u2019t care about that kind of thing? Losing chastity before marriage, this is a big scandal, ah! No one will be so stupid to want a second hand good! Longze Yu Er began to admire her own cleverness.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui is already dead. The dead can\u2019t testify. That matter can\u2019t be let go. As for is she is or isn\u2019t a broken shoe, just take a look at the Shou Gong Sha and we will know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shou Gong Sha</p><br/><p>Shou Gong Sha</p><br/><p>Shou Gong Sha: gecko cinnabar/ protector of the palace. In ancient China there should be blood on the bed when a woman has intercourse for the first time. Another way to check if they were a virgin was with the gecko cinnabar. The gecko cinnabar is a red colored powder made of dried gecko fed on cinnabar. It is said to leave a red mark on a woman\u2019s body, most of the time the upper arm. Supposedly, the mark will fade away once the woman had intercourse.</p><br/><p>Check the Shou Gong Sha? This is not a bad idea! Murong Qi Qi revealed a cold smile. Having watched Longze Yu Er performing alone for so long, she this involved part also needed to appear.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, what are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the smile on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face, Longze Yu Er froze for a moment. Then she taunted: \u201cNow you still have the face to smile? Wait a while and you won\u2019t even be able to cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Longze Yu Er like that, the hand Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands was somewhat chilly. His voice also turned cold: \u201cLongze Yu Er, don\u2019t go too far!\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing beside Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi clearly felt the chill on this man\u2019s body. If it wasn\u2019t because he was still talking in soft and gentle words to her, Murong Qi Qi would\u2019ve thought the person next to her was changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang squeezed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s soft hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how you are, you are still the wangfei benwang wants!\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning of Feng Cang\u2019s words were very clear. No matter what Murong Qi Qi chose, he will protect her and he also doesn\u2019t need for Murong Qi Qi to use such way to prove herself, because he believes her.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s protectiveness let Murong Qi Qi be very moved.</p><br/><p>To a woman, verifying the Shou Gong Sha is a very humiliating thing. But her reputation being publicly insulted, if she didn\u2019t prove it then it\u2019ll be like a scar on her body and she will be bearing an ugly reputation for the rest of her life. For her whole life, she wouldn\u2019t be able to raise her head again.</p><br/><p>After all, here isn\u2019t the twenty first century. This is a traditional society. Since she came here, she must follow the rules of this world and she can\u2019t let people slander her!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I\u2019m fine since princess Ping Yang questions bengong\u2019s4 innocence, bengong is willing to be investigated. But if bengong is clean as ice and clear as jade, then all of these will be princess Ping Yang slandering and vilifying me. Then how should we punish princess\u2019s slander?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clean as ice and clear as jade: spotless</p><br/><p>\u201cIf what bengong said is false, bengong is willing to accept any punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er wasn\u2019t afraid. Murong Xin Lian told her all of these. She doesn\u2019t have a reason to lie to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! If it\u2019s slander, bengong wants the head on princess\u2019s body as the price for humiliating bengong today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi said those words chopping the nail and slicing the iron, making Longze Yu Er flustered. But thinking about those rumors and everything Murong Xin Lian told her, Longze Yu Er got her strength back. Besides she is Xi Qi country\u2019s princess, Murong Qi Qi is just an official\u2019s daughter. Wanting her head, can it be that Murong Qi Qi wants to offend her superior?</p><br/><p>Chopping the nail and slicing the iron: resolute and decisive</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem! But if you are not a virgin, bengong wants you to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>The things happened too suddenly, so sudden Duanmu Qing hadn\u2019t had the time to stop her daughter. That day she was present. There wasn\u2019t Lian gongzi5 and there wasn\u2019t the so called affair. All of these are rumors. She didn\u2019t think that her foolish daughter will believe them!</p><br/><p>Since the bet has already been put, what can she do now? What can she do? Should she let the old maid who will do the examination commit fraud?</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing\u2019s anxiousness went into Murong Xue Lian\u2019s eyes. Just thinking once, she understood the situation. Such a good chance to hit the empress, how can Murong Xue Lian let it pass?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, princess Zhao Yang is the future Nan Lin wangfei. Her body is precious. How can servants touch her body? Besides, girls have thin face. If you let her be examined in the crowd, how will she be able to face people in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian had some fatigue. Her body slightly tilted and nestled in Longze Yu\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian\u2019s words went into Longze Yu\u2019s heart. Longze Yu Er really has a pig\u2019s brain. No matter if Murong Qi Qi is or isn\u2019t a virgin, in the end Feng Cang will get angry. The one who will suffer damage is still Xi Qi! Longze Yu really wanted to strangle this daughter!</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort, what do you think we should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fragrant jade in his arms, Longze Yu\u2019s mood became slightly better. It\u2019s still this little woman in his arms who is the most understanding and understands his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we look for a few misses from the great families with the same status. Everyone is the same age and wouldn\u2019t have that awkwardness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian proposal made Longze Yu couldn\u2019t help but clap. Then he asked Murong Qi Qi\u2019s opinion. Murong Qi Qi has nothing to say. No matter what, today\u2019s shame, she must get it back!</p><br/><p>Misses from the great families with same status, there are only two\u2026\u2026Bai Yi Yue and Duanmu Yi Yi. They have been called forward. Then the palace maids pulled down a two-meter-high white cloth. In the middle of the imperial garden, the cloth held up like a barrier box. The three entered.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the first time that Duanmu Yi Yi encountered such a thing. She was a little nervous. After all, the empress is her paternal aunt. Longze Yu Er is her cousin. Their relation is not so general.</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation Duanmu Yi Yi is in, Murong Qi Qi was calm and generous. She took off her outer layer of the gown and exposed a snow white arm. A bright red as blood and been sized Shou Gong Sha lay quietly on that piece of whiteness. The truth is exposed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess has suffered!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue saw the Shou Gong Sha and nodded at Murong Qi Qi. She personally helped her put the dress back on.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoping that the two of you will give bengong\u2019s innocent back!\u201d</p><br/><p>After being dressed, Murong Qi Qi went out of the barrier.</p><br/><p>What should she do? What should she do?! Duanmu Yi Yi was very hesitant. What should she do if she said the truth and Murong Qi Qi really kills Longze Yu Er? Then if empress aunt wants to find who is accountable for, she will definitely come calculate with her!</p><br/><p>But to let her slander Muong Qi Qi, not mentioning that there\u2019s still a Bai Yi Yue as witness, she can\u2019t even pass her own conscience. Duanmu Yi Yi knows very well how important reputation is to a woman!</p><br/><p>As Duanmu Yi Yi was still being hesitant, Bai Yi Yue said some words which made her decide completely.</p><br/><p>TLNote: I moved the special and history over to volare.

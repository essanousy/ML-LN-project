He shouted, \u201cFire dragon flag!\u201d The main hall was in uproar again. \u201cWhat?! There is a war again! What is going on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, ah! This is too fishy! What had happened?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for the discussion to end, a soldier appeared in front of everyone. Because being contaminated with dust, the fire dragon flag had become somewhat dirty. Only the golden dragon embroidered on the fire dragon flag could vaguely be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnounce! Jurchin ethic tribe\u2019s hundred thousand men went from north to south and attacked Yushui gate. General Li Yi died on the battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the arrival of three fire dragon flags in one day, the peaceful Bei Zhou fell into a state of tension. Feng Cang and Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t hide anything about the war. They announced it while they stabilized the citizens.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Bei Zhou had always been united and the entire nation was brought to arms. The citizens didn\u2019t go much in panic.</p><br/><p>Inside the study, Wanyan Jie was so tired that he fell asleep in the dragon chair. Feng Cang, Wanyan Kang and a few generals were still studying the military situation. Dong Lu, Xi Qi, Jurchen, why did the three parties launch an attack without any warning? Could it be that someone threaded a needle between? Who on earth was it?</p><br/><p>To thread a needle: to act as a go-between</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Zhen Guo has arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shout \u2018princess Zhen Guo\u2019 let Feng Cang look up. Only now did he discover that the sky was already dark. The night fell. In the sky was a lot more stars. They had spent the whole day in the imperial study.</p><br/><p>Su Mei, Su Yue and a few palace maids carrying a food box followed behind Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you guys would be too busy to eat. So, I let people prepare something to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Feng Qi Qi spoke, Wanyan Kang\u2019s stomach coordinated well and made sounds. He touched his head embarrassingly, \u201cCousin in law, you\u2019ve arrived in time. I\u2019m really so hungry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t finish speaking when he saw Su Mei behind Feng Qi Qi. He immediately put the things in his hands down and came to Su Mei, \u201cLittle Mei er, I finally saw you! I missed you so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s explicit confession made Su Mei blush, \u201cYou want to die?! There are others here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing someone laugh from behind, did Wanyan Kang understood that they were at the imperial study. He immediately put on a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Su Mei and Su Yu put the food on the table. Feng Qi Qi called everyone over to eat, \u201cOne can\u2019t function properly on an empty stomach. Everyone, eat before going to work again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although, those generals had also seen Feng Qi Qi in the past, but being in such a close contact with princess Zheng Guo who had the title of the number one beauty of the word and not to mention that she was so approachable, they felt shy. Originally, they intended to be polite. After all, here was the emperor\u2019s imperial study, but Wanyan Kang directly pulled the people to sit down, \u201cCousin in law is right! First eat. After eating, let\u2019s go beat those f***** dogs!\u201d</p><br/><p>The personality of the generals was bold and unconstrained. They saw that Xiaoyao wang1 was being like this, they no longer acted shy. They saw that Feng Cang, the head didn\u2019t object. Everyone sat around the table. They had been hungry for a day. These strong man\u2019s stomachs rumbled with hunger. They no longer cared that here was the imperial study and took big mouthfuls of meat and soup.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t eat immediately. He came to Feng Qi Qi and helped her sit down. \u201cWhy did you come in person? It would be fine if you sent Su Mei and Su Yue to bring it over! You\u2019re someone pregnant. You need to take care of yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, my husband the lord!\u201d Seeing that Feng Cang was so wordy, Feng Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but stuck her tongue out, \u201cDon\u2019t forget I\u2019m a doctor. I\u2019m fine. You go eat first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang\u2019s bloodshot eyes, Feng Qi Qi felt heartache. Enemy on the three sides was really too surprising. This time, Feng Cang would be busy.</p><br/><p>The people eating here woke Wanyan Jie up. Wanyan Jie rubbed his eyes, sat up and saw Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunty!\u201d Wanyan Jie happily ran to Feng Qi Qi. He liked this little aunty. So, every time, when Feng Qi Qi came to the palace, Wanyan Jie would be around her for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cJie er2, are you hungry? Come, eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew that these big men were careless. They certainly forgot that there was still a child here. Feng Qi Qi specially prepared a nutritional meal for children for Wanyan Jie. Sure enough, Wanyan Jie was very hungry. He sat beside Feng Qi Qi. One of his hand had to hold Feng Qi Qi\u2019s before he was willing to eat obediently.</p><br/><p>Although he had many things to say to Feng Qi Qi, but Dongfang Lan taught him not to speak during a meal. So, when he ate, Wanyan Jie was very well-mannered. Plus, the fact that Su Mei\u2019s skills were very good. Wanyan Jie ate very much.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo delicious!\u201d Wanyan Jie sat next to Feng Qi Qi. He laughed and exposed a missing front tooth. \u201cLittle aunty, the food you brought is more delicious than those of the imperial kitchen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJie er is so well-behaved!\u201d Feng Qi Qi lovingly touched Wanyan Jie\u2019s head. \u201cDid you like the toy aunty gave you before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like it very much! I like little aunty the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>Usually, he was demanded to have the demeanor and appearance of an emperor. So, no matter if Wanyan Jie was attending the court or not attending the court, he always was like a little adult. Only in front of Feng Qi Qi would he reveal the innocence of a child. This beautiful aunt was a good person. This already formed a conclusion in Wanyan Jie\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi had always liked children. Plus, the fact that Wanyan Jie\u2019s life was so pitiful, so, she cared more about him. Wanyan Kang and the others were still eating. Feng Qi Qi held Wanyan Jie\u2019s small hand and led him to the map on the table.</p><br/><p>Because Wanyan Jie wasn\u2019t tall enough, Feng Qi Qi held him and let him stand on the chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cJie er, look. This is Bei Zhou\u2019s dynasty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi carefully introduces Bei Zhou\u2019s situation to Wanyan Jie. Moreover, she referred Yan gate, Shi gate, Yushui gate plus Dong Lu, Xi Qi and Jurchin tribe to him. \u201cThis is Bei Zhou\u2019s territory. Now, it had been invaded. Bei Zhou\u2019s citizen are oppressed by the foreign enemies. Jie er, what do you think needs to be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFight!\u201d Under Feng Qi Qi\u2019s guidance, Wanyan Jie clenched his fists. \u201cDrive them away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Jie\u2019s lofty ideals made Feng Qi Qi appreciate it very much, \u201cJie er, you have to remember. As a monarch, you need to be the guardian angel of the citizens. You must guard your country! The purpose of an emperor is to change the country into a clenched fist and let the whole country be in unison. Like that, the country would be strong, the people would be blessed and Bei Zhou would become the king of mainland. Others wouldn\u2019t dare to bully us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAunty, I know! I will be a good emperor and won\u2019t let anyone bully my people!\u201d Wanyan Jie\u2019s small face had a firm expression. His small hand had also became a fist.</p><br/><p>In a few words Feng Qi Qi let Wanyan Jie understand the general principle, making the others surprised.</p><br/><p>After they finished eating, Feng Qi Qi gave a lot of talk to Wanyan Jie. Her voice was gentle. Her language was easy to understand. Through storytelling she taught knowledge and let Wanyan Jie understand it by hearing it for the first time. \u201cAunty, you teach better than the teacher! The moment, you said it, I fully understood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Jie childish words amused Su Mei and Su Yue, making them laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? Then, aunty will come often to the palace and tell you stories, alright?\u201d Feng Qi Qi pulled Wanyan Jie\u2019s small nose.</p><br/><p>The moment he heard that Feng Qi Qi would come see him often, of course Wanyan Jie clapped and cheered, \u201cGood, ah! I like aunty the most! Aunty has to come often!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d After Feng Qi Qi and Wanyan Jie hooked their pinky in promise, she let Shan Xi bring Wanyan Jie back to Jinxuan palace to rest. When he was leaving, Wanyan Jie was very reluctant to part with her. He turned many times. \u201cAunty must come visit me more often!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Feng Qi Qi gestured with her hand and promised once again. Wanyan Jie left the imperial study reluctantly.</p><br/><p>The bowls and chopsticks had already been cleaned from the table. It seemed that Feng Cang and Wanyan Kang would stay in the palace tonight, \u201cGo back and rest earlier. You don\u2019t need to wait for me!\u201d Feng Cang sent Feng Qi Qi to the door, \u201cTake care of yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d Feng Qi Qi knew that the situation was critical. It was not the time for love and affection. She tiptoed and kissed Feng Cang\u2019s lips. Accompanied by Su Mei and Su Yue, she left the palace.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the regent\u2019s residence, Feng Qi Qi let Su Mei and Su Yue stay and also called over Nalan Xin and Jin Mo. When they came over, Feng Qi Qi\u2019s expression turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cNalan Xin, how is the situation in Dong Lu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangfei, 3it was too sudden. Many intelligences hadn\u2019t arrived yet. However, from the information we already have, Dong Lu\u2019s Xia Jin is persecuting in the name of revenge for Xia Yun Xi and let great general Hu Xue Shen lead a total of hundred fifty men to attack Yan gate. Now, Yan gate had been seized. Hu Xue Shen already invaded three provinces at the east of Bei Zhou. However, he encountered great resistance and had been detained at the three places, Pingyi, Gaoyang and Jinyuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t our army notice anything when hundred thousand men attacked? Is there a spy or\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangfei, you have something you don\u2019t know about. Bei Zhou and Dong Lu always had a good relation. There had never been war between the two countries. Near Yan gate is Dong Lu\u2019s second largest city, Yu gate. Since ancient times, Yu gate had been populous and affluent. Since the former Qin, Dong Lu had been worried that Yu gate would become other countries\u2019 prey. It had always been heavily guarded. This habit had become their surprise. Our army didn\u2019t have any reason to take precautions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin\u2019s explanation made Feng Qi Qi understand the reason. Fo Sheng Men\u2019s forces were mostly in Bei Zhou and Dong Lu. So, the information they found were highly authentic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yue, what\u2019s the matter with Xi Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, ten days ago, Longze Yu decreed Longze Jing Tian the crown prince. The war was proposed by Longze Jing Tian. Longze Jing Tian\u2019s proposal received great family Shangguan and great family Duanmu\u2019s support. Great family Shangguan had long wanted to take revenge for what had happened at Yandang mountain. This time, that Longze Jing Tian was able to become the crown prince was also because of great family Shangguan\u2019s support. It could be said that Longze Jing Tian was able to become the crown prince because he got the military\u2019s support!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Longze Jing Tian\u2019s name, Feng Qi Qi frowned. This person was ambitious. She had long known this. It was just, she didn\u2019t think that Longze Jing Tian would use attacking Bei Zhou as a springboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the one that is leading the army?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, the one who is leading Xi Qi\u2019s army is general Shangguan Wu Ji\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Wu Ji? For a while, Feng Qi Qi was silent. She and Shangguan Wu Ji were friends. She didn\u2019t expect that in the end, the two would become enemies because of the interests of both countries. It seemed, in this world there was no feast that wouldn\u2019t end. Many things were not to one\u2019s own volition.</p><br/><p>However, between Bei Zhou and Xi Qi, between Feng Cang and Shangguan Wu Ji, Feng Qi Qi would certainly choose the first one.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about Jurchin tribe? Ten years ago, wasn\u2019t Jurchin beaten by Feng Cang into the desert? Why did Jurchin tribe gather this time in the north?\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Er: term of endearment</p><br/><p>3. Wangfei: the main wife of the prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Everyone was busy preparing for Wanyan Kang\u2019s wedding.</p><br/><p>Ever since the wedding was set, Murong Qi Qi had hidden Su Mei and didn\u2019t let Wanyan Kang see her. Every time Wanyan Kang went to the regent\u2019s residence, he was driven out by Murong Qi Qi. Every time, she would say that his character was not good. If she faces Wanyan Kang for a long time, it would affect the child in her belly.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi used the excuse that everything was for the well-being of the baby. Feng Cang also stood at his beloved wife\u2019s side. Although he obviously knew that Murong Qi Qi was making things difficult for Wanyan Kang, Feng Cang was still biased towards Murong Qi Qi and supported her. You had to know, brothers are like hands and feet, beloved wife is like clothes. Clothing could keep one warm. This feature was far beyond brothers.</p><br/><p>The expression- brothers are like hands and feet and wives are like clothes- was usually used to describe that brothers are indispensable, and women could be changed like clothes, meaning friends/family are more important than lovers. Only FC would change it to clothes could keep warm which means that MQQ is more important than WK. </p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, you pamper cousin-in-law too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the study, Wanyan Kang put on a miserable look and looked with resentment and indignation at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Every day in the past, he had noisily played with Su Mei. He\u2019d never experienced the pain of being separated. Now, it was great (sarcasm). For a few days, let alone see Su Mei, he couldn\u2019t even hear Su Mei\u2019s voice. To Wanyan Kang, this was definitely a type of torment and torture.</p><br/><p>In the morning, he\u2019d originally intended to break into Tingsong building, but he didn\u2019t expect that that pair of brother and sister, Ruyi and Jixiang, would be guarding Tingsong building. They had a unanimous -against outsiders- expression, making him feel very cold.</p><br/><p>Fight one, he would only be up to the fight. Fight two, moreover, it was this pair of twins, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.</p><br/><p>In the end, Wanyan Kang could only suck it in and came gleaming with tears to beg Feng Cang. He didn\u2019t expect that the moment he opened his mouth, Feng Cang would put Murong Qi Qi out and say things like, \u201cQing Qing said the prenatal influence is very important. You being like this, will affect the baby\u2019s mental health\u201d, making Wanyan Kang wish he could turn over Feng Cang\u2019s table if he had the guts.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, my woman is to be loved and to be pampered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, do you have humanity?! You and cousin-in-law are lovey dovey every day. I and little Mei er3 can\u2019t even see each other. Do you want us to be together or are you trying to break us up, ah?!\u201d Wanyan Kang pretended to be sad, but he had used this move many times before. Feng Cang would no longer be moved by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better if you just act well-behaved for the wedding! When it\u2019s the wedding night, you can see Su Mei. Previously, didn\u2019t a certain someone want to wander the horizon?! If you can\u2019t stand it, then you can go play for three or five years and then come back, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s light tone had a hint of teasing, making Wanyan Kang\u2019s face become red, \u201cCousin brother, don\u2019t make fun of me! Look at cousin-in-law, it\u2019s better that I marry little Mei er before going. Even if I go, I will take her with me! Lest cousin-in-law seduce her away from me when I\u2019m not here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without being able to find a breakthrough from Feng Cang, Wanyan Kang could only return to Xiaoyao wangfu in dismay.</p><br/><p>Shortly after Wanyan Kang had left, Murong Qi Qi entered the study. \u201cDid ah Kang come to bother you again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlow down, slow down!\u201d Ever since Murong Qi Qi got pregnant, Feng Cang was even more nervous than her. The moment he saw Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang immediately put down the documents and walked quickly to Murong Qi Qi. He escorted her cautiously, \u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang being like this prompted Su Yue, who was behind Murong Qi Qi, to laugh, \u201cGuye4 really loves miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, come, come, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi sat down, Feng Cang let out a sigh of relief. He was so nervous, making Murong Qi Qi shook her head laughingly, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, but you\u2019re more nervous than me. Then, when it\u2019s time for the birth and the baby hasn\u2019t been born yet, will you faint first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s teasing made Feng Cang blush. This was the first time that he would be a father. He didn\u2019t know what would happen and since Murong Qi Qi had the gu, so naturally, he was even more nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t need to be so nervous. Let nature take its course. You being this nervous will also make me afraid. It won\u2019t be good if it affects the baby by chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the words were said like that, but the worry in Feng Cang was unable to be eliminated even a little bit. Not to mention that he thought Murong Qi Qi was comforting him on purpose. So, he intended to go ask Jin Mo how to be an expectant father.</p><br/><p>The one who came with Su Yue was her husband Nalan Xin. These two had long loved the affection between Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi. Seeing his master treat his beloved wife like this, Nalan Xin glanced once at Su Yue\u2019s belly. It seemed that he needed to work harder to let a little baby come out earlier!</p><br/><p>\u201cGuye, miss, we have some progress on who attacked Bai Yi Yue before.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Su Yue put the information she\u2019d found in front of Feng Cang and also told him the result of the investigation, \u201cThe prints left behind the tree should be from the wheels of a wheelchair. There are only few people in Yan capital who use a wheelchair. The most suspicious person is the one, who\u2019d come not long ago from Penglai Island and who\u2019d also saved Murong Qing Lian, called Misha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the observation of our people, Misha and Jia Lan are living in a house at the east.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue pointed at the map of the capital. Red sand marked the specific location, \u201cThe maid at Misha\u2019s side is called Xia Xue. The guard at Jia Lan\u2019s side is called Jin Yu. Aside from the four of them, in the house, there are a cook and two servants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome time ago, Xia Xue looked for Moyu and Fo Sheng Men. She wanted to hear from us about Bai Yi Yue. However, she was rejected by us. Recently, Xia Xue spent heavily for Su Mei\u2019s information. However, we hid it intentionally. So, she didn\u2019t find much useful information.\u201d</p><br/><p>The information from Nalan Xin interested Murong Qi Qi, \u201cXia Xue is Misha\u2019s people. Naturally, she did that because Misha asked. However, why did Misha look for Bai Yi Yue and Su Mei?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Nalan Xin shook his head. \u201cMisha is the great disciple of Penglai Island. Penglai Island has always been a mysterious existence. So, we have no way of knowing about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking till here, Su Yue thought of one thing, \u201cMiss, our people found a female corpse at the outskirts ten days ago. It had been determined that the person is Murong Qing Lian. She had been killed and it was by one stroke. When Murong Qing Lian died, she was two months pregnant. At her side were ten naked men. They\u2019d also died with one stroke. The way they were killed was fast. The wound was small but fatal.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Su Yue said that, Nalan Xin frowned, \u201cI saw the corpses at Jingting mountain. They\u2019d also died with one stroke. The weapon is a thin sword. The murderer was fast and the wound was very subtle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, these two matters may have be done by the same person. Whether it was Murong Qing Lian\u2019s or Jingting mountain\u2019s matter, were they done by the same person?\u201d Murong Qi Qi nodded thoughtfully. \u201cMisha sat in a wheelchair. Even if he wanted to kill someone, it wouldn\u2019t be so neatly done. A thin sword is suitable for women. Reasoning like this, the one who did it should be Xia Xue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone agreed on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s analysis. Why did Xia Xue kill Murong Qing Lian? Also, why did she find people to attack Bai Yi Yue?</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember, when Misha took Murong Qing Lian away in the hall, his demeanor was very gentle. He also once called her \u2018little sister\u2019. Why did he kill Murong Qing Lian in a blink of an eye?\u201d Feng Cang recalled the first time he had seen that innocent handsome boy. That person\u2019s smile was so clean and could be compared to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qing Lian, Bai Yi Yue, Su Mei\u2026,\u201d Su Yue bit her lips. She tried hard to find the common ground of these three people. She thought for a long time, but didn\u2019t find any relation between them.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Feng Cang stood up. His expression was serious as never before, \u201cI know what is the common ground of these three people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he looked at Murong Qi Qi. After a short silence, he said the answer, \u201cQing Qing, including you, all four of you participated in the tournament of the four countries.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Feng Cang said that, a light flashed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s brain. She always felt that there was something strange at the tournament of the four countries. However, she\u2019d thought for a long while, but she didn\u2019t find the problem. Now that Feng Cang had said this, she suddenly remembered the seven-floor pagoda.</p><br/><p>A distant memory seemed to have been turned on. Why did she feel that the seven-floor pagoda was strange? Could it be that because the tests of the seven-floor pagoda were similar to the training of her previous life? Who is Misha? He killed Murong Qing Lian, attacked Bai Yi Yue and was now inquiring about Su Mei. Then, would she be the next?</p><br/><p>Previously, Jia Lan had said that he was the one who made the tests, but now, it seemed that Misha was likely the one who\u2019d made the tests of the seven-floor pagoda. If it really was Misha, then who is Misha? Could it be him? Adoptive father had created such a training program specifically for the two of them. Why did it appear at the seven-floor pagoda? Could it be that he\u2019d also time-travelled\u2026?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was exceptionally quiet. So quiet that it was somewhat frightening. At this time, her expression was very grave. An uneasiness appeared in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart. The once asleep intuition of before burst out. Recalling the cold muzzle of the gun that was against her in the past life, Murong Qi Qi shivered.</p><br/><p>What had happened? Why did Murong Qi Qi have such an expression? When he saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face, a pain appeared in Feng Cang\u2019s heart. Such a Murong Qi Qi was so vulnerable that it made other people\u2019s heart ache.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang held Murong qi Qi\u2019s hand. He wanted to warm her up. \u201cQing Qing, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi raised her head. The desolateness in her eyes startled Feng Cang. He immediately reached out and pulled Murong Qi Qi in his embrace. \u201cWhat happened, Qing Qing? Tell me what happened. Don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m at your side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCang!\u201d Murong Qi Qi hugged Feng Cang tightly. Her body shivered slightly. \u201cHe has come! He certainly has come!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if the information was not yet complete, but the uneasiness in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart gradually expanded. When Misha took Murong Qing Lian away, he called her \u2018little sister\u2019. Could this not explain the problem? If it is really Lian Sheng who had come, then what should she do?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s brain was in chaos. All the memories of the previous life opened at this time. Adoptive father had died at Lian Sheng\u2019s hand. She\u2019d also died at Lian Sheng\u2019s hands. If Misha really was Lian Sheng, she must take revenge for adoptive father! Must!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi being like this made Su Yue and Nalan Xin very worried. Su Yue didn\u2019t know what \u2018he came\u2019 meant. She wanted to go forward, but was stopped by Nalan Xin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out!\u201d Nalan Xin pointed at Murong Qi Qi who was hugging Feng Cang tightly. He gestured at Su Yue. This time belonged to the young couple. It\u2019s better if others didn\u2019t disturb them.</p><br/><p>Su Yue obediently followed Nalan Xin and left the study. Now, inside the study, only Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang were left.</p><br/><p>Looking at the two rows of tears on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face, Feng Cang didn\u2019t know what Murong Qi Qi was afraid of. He reached out and held her small face. His fingers gently wiped Murong Qi Qi\u2019s tears, \u201cQing Qing, what happened? Who is the \u2018he\u2019 you talked about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe killed adoptive father. Killed me!\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s chest was very stuffy. She panted. That person, the one she had been regarding as her elder brother; she didn\u2019t expect that he would kill her beloved adoptive father. In the end, he had also hurt her severely! She will not forgive him! She will not\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a demon. He\u2019s a devil!\u201d Don\u2019t know if it was because she was too emotional or what, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s breath didn\u2019t catch up with her. She fainted.</p><br/><p>That Murong Qi Qi fainted made Feng Cang lose his self-control, \u201cQing Qing!\u201d Feng Cang roared. He held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s soft body and rushed out of the study like the wind. \u201cPeople! Quickly call Jin Mo over! Quickly go call Jin Mo!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jin Mo arrived at Tingsong building, he was dragged inside by Feng Cang, \u201cJin Mo, quickly look. How is she? Why is she like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have the time to bother with the pain from Feng Cang\u2019s grip. Jin Mo checked Murong Qi Qi\u2019s pulse, \u201cWangye, keep calm, don\u2019t get excited. Princess only got too stirred up. That was why she had fainted temporarily. There are no serious problems with her body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo said that Murong Qi Qi was fine. But Feng Cang was still a bit worried, \u201cWas really nothing affected?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess is fine. She only needs some rest. However, now, princess is pregnant, and coupled with the fact that her body is weak, naturally she couldn\u2019t be compared with those healthy pregnant women. Asking wangye to please pay more attention!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Feng Cang didn\u2019t expect that such a thing would happen. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s final stirred-up look constantly replayed in his mind. Is the \u2018he\u2019 Murong Qi Qi talked about Misha? When did she get to know Misha?</p><br/><p>\u201cNalan Xin, send people to observe Misha\u2019s every move! In addition, don\u2019t let Su Mei out of the wangfu. Send a letter to miss Bai. Let her also be careful and pay attention to her safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>A person that made Murong Qi Qi guard herself against, naturally isn\u2019t someone ordinary. Misha, Misha\u2026Feng Cang severely carved this name in his heart. You hurt my beloved wife, I will take your life!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi slowly woke up. It was already in the middle the night. When she slowly opened her eyes, Feng Cang looked at her with a worried look. His handsome brow was now frowning. Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but reach out and touch Feng Cang\u2019s face, \u201cDon\u2019t frown. Frowning is not handsome! It will affect your image!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that there was really nothing serious with Murong Qi Qi like Jin Mo said, the stone pressing in Feng Cang\u2019s heart was finally released, \u201cQing Qing, it\u2019s alright that you\u2019re fine! It\u2019s alright that you\u2019re fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a time when Murong Qi Qi was asleep which made Feng Cang feel very worried. He was terrified that she would be in a deep sleep and wouldn\u2019t wake up like Wanyan Ming Yue. However, he was afraid to wake her up; afraid that he would disturb her rest. It wouldn\u2019t be good for her and the child. So, while Murong Qi Qi was asleep, Feng Cang sat at her bedside and didn\u2019t dare to leave. He wanted to be the first person she saw when she woke up.</p><br/><p>That pair of long and devilish beautiful eyes of Feng Cang was full of concern at this time. Murong Qi Qi knew that just now, she must\u2019ve really frightened this man. \u201cI\u2019m fine. The baby is also very fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi say that, Feng Cang let out a sigh of relief. He lowered his head and gently kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead, \u201cQing Qing, you must be hungry. I will feed you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang let people bring the meal that had long been warming at a side. He helped Murong Qi Qi up and personally fed her. After her nap, Murong Qi Qi was very hungry. She ate a lot in one go.</p><br/><p>Throughout the whole meal, Feng Cang didn\u2019t mention Misha for fear that he would stir up Murong Qi Qi. Only when they took a walk after the meal did Murong Qi Qi take the initiative to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, do you want to know who Misha is?\u201d Murong Qi Qi leaned against Feng Cang\u2019s shoulder. The peace of mind this man gave her couldn\u2019t be matched by anyone. At this time, leaning against him and recalling the past, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart was a lot more settled.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, don\u2019t think about him! Since he makes you unhappy, then we\u2019ll kill him!\u201d Feng Cang narrowed his eyes. His voice was gentle, but the murderous intent in his eyes got more intense. He had never wanted to kill someone so much! Even if there was Penglai Island behind Misha, what about it?! He\u2019d offended his woman. There\u2019s only death for him!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Misha is really the person I\u2019m talking about, then he indeed deserves to die! Even dying one hundred, one thousand times wouldn\u2019t be enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>It had been so many years, but whenever she thought about how adoptive father had died at Lian Sheng\u2019s hand, Murong Qi Qi wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive. That was the person who\u2019d taken them to his house and gave them a home. Moreover, he gave them a warm and kind-hearted elder. He was the person Murong Qi Qi had respected the most.</p><br/><p>She could not bothered about the grudge between her and Lian Sheng, but Lian Sheng had killed adoptive father. She will not forgive this!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut before you get rid of him, I should tell you about the real me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had never told anyone about her real identity. Originally, she intended to conceal it forever like this and live with her current identity. She had a man she loved. In the future, she would have a bunch of cute children. She would always live happily ever after.</p><br/><p>However, now, an unexpected matter such as Misha appeared. This let Murong Qi Qi feel that she needed to let Feng Cang know the real her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang, perhaps the things I\u2019m about to say will be unimaginable to you, but I swear, every word I say is the truth. You must believe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Wangfu: residence of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>3. Er: term of endearment</p><br/><p>4.

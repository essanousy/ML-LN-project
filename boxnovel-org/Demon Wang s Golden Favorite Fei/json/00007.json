He didn\u2019t expect that, after not seeing her for five years, she had learned to complain. Li Yun Qing saying this, could it be that she had said something in front of Li family?</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi maintaining her timid appearance, anger swelled up in Murong Tai\u2019s heart. If it wasn\u2019t because of Li Yun Qing\u2019s presence, he would have kicked this rubbish. Want beauty, have no beauty. Want ability, have no ability. How did he, Murong Tai, give birth to such a thing?! It really was a disgrace!</p><br/><p>After Murong Xin Lian listened to Li Yun Qing\u2019s words, she was somewhat afraid and thought that the things she\u2019d let Fei Cui do had been discovered. But she waited for a long time \u2013 Li Yun Qing didn\u2019t speak and Murong Tai also didn\u2019t pursue the matter. Murong Xin Lian let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>It seemed that father really didn\u2019t care about Murong Qi Qi! In the end, rubbish was still rubbish and was no use to the family. No wonder father had turned his back on her!</p><br/><p>Before Murong Tai could say which side he stood after Li Yun Qing\u2019s words, they heard a cry that could shake the heaven and earth. Two women dressed in flirtatious clothing cried \u2018my child\u2019 one after another and directly charged into Cui Zhu yuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing er2, how come your face is like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yan Zhi shook her head which was full of gold and silver jewelleries. She put Murong Qing Lian\u2019s face in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho has such a black heart and used such a hard method, wanting to ruin my child\u2019s face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yan Zhi\u2019s tearful voice just fell, Zheng Min also began to wail: \u201cXin er, my Xin er, how come you\u2019re hurt like this? The most important thing of a girl is her looks. Who is it that hates your beauty and wanted to destroy you so viciously?! My pitiful Xin er, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because these two people came, Cui Zhu yuan became lively. Liu Yan Zhi embraced Murong Qing Lian and came in front of Murong Tai to let him see the traces of whip on Murong Qing Lian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld master, look at our Qing er, ah. She\u2019s someone who needs to attend the athletic race, ah. Now that she is hurt like this, how could she go see people?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yan Zhi was quite a charming woman. Although she had given birth to two children and was already thirty six, but her skin was still soft and tender. Her facial features had a completely seductive appearance. While she was wiping her tears away with a handkerchief, she also looked furiously at Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld master, if something happen to Qing er, this concubine will also not live anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Liu Yan Zhi \u2018being the thief, crying thief\u2019, Zheng Min didn\u2019t spare a minute and grabbed Murong Xin Lian to let Murong Tai see the face which had been ruined by a sword.</p><br/><p>Compared with Liu Yan Zhi\u2019s grace, Zheng Min\u2019s body gave out a more delicate and charming state. In particular, that pair of watery eyes. Just inducing a little, it would make people\u2019s hearts be in so much pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld master, Xin er is the number one beauty of the capital, ah! How many young masters from the official families have a crush on our Xin er? How many rich legitimate sons want to marry her? But now her looks have been destroyed, how should my pitiful Xin er continue to live, ah?! Old master, you should get justice for us, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two women plus two unmarried young maidens; four people crying in a circle, really noisy. Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but frown. If she had known that this would\u2019ve lead to the noises of these women, she would not have let the two begin to fight.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s impatience, falling into Li Yun Qing\u2019s eyes had another meaning. It seems that this little cousin sister really had changed\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Two beloved concubines were crying really hard and wanting him to give them justice, making Murong Tai get a headache. The palm of the hands and the backs of the hands are all meat. Two daughters, one had outstanding ability and one had outstanding looks. Usually, they didn\u2019t have such a state of hostility towards each other. What had happened today that they turned out like this?!</p><br/><p>No matter how much Murong Tai thought, he couldn\u2019t understand the hidden reason plus the women\u2019s cries were really noisy. And Li Yun Qing was still standing with his hands crossed over each other and with an appearance of wanting to watch a good play, making the anger in Murong Tai\u2019s heart immediately rise.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, don\u2019t make any noise! There\u2019s a guest here. Go back to your ownyuans3!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yan Zhi and Zheng Min were surprised by Murong Tai\u2019s shout. They saw that Murong Tai was really angry.</p><br/><p>These two women, who\u2019d followed Murong Tai for so many years, recovered their tempers and wiped their tears. Each one pulled their daughter away and left Cui Zhu yuan.</p><br/><p>When Zheng Min left, she glanced once with resentment at Murong Tai. In contrast, Liu Yan Zhi, with an appearance of calling innocence for her daughter, casted an affectionate glance at Murong Tai.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld master, today this concubine personally boiled chicken soup for master. Tonight, old master must come, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because there were still people next to her, Murong Qi Qi would\u2019ve certainly held the spittoon and vomited. No wonder Liu Yan Zhi\u2019s status at the prime minister\u2019s was greater than the first wife. Such a woman was really a \u2018rarity\u2019.</p><br/><p>After the people had left, Murong Tai looked coldly at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stay here well. Just came back and provoked so many happenings! Punishing you with shutting yourself up for one month and thinking about your mistakes! Don\u2019t be a disgrace! Humph\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With a wave of the sleeves, Murong Tai didn\u2019t care that Li Yun Qing was still here, strode away and left Cui Zhu yuan. The direction he went to was Ou Xiang yuan, the place where Zheng Min lived. At this moment, Murong Tai was most worried about Murong Xin Lian\u2019s looks getting ruined. This daughter was the number one beauty of the capital. Murong Tai was even planning to marry her into the royal family. By that time, he would have two daughter conosrts, who will bring him unlimited glory!</p><br/><p>Murong Tai\u2019s hurried appearance made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart completely turn cold for this family. It seemed that this Murong Tai really had no feeling for this third daughter! If it wasn\u2019t because she\u2019d promised godfather that she would protect that person, she would have gone traveling through the jianghu4 and wouldn\u2019t be staying here to play the role of the useless third miss!</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, Su Yue, troubling you to clean up here. The ones that have no use, throw them away and there\u2019s also no need to purchase them again lest they get destroyed again next time and need to be thrown away once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being disturbed by four women, Murong Qi Qi was somewhat tired. She turned and looked at Li Yun Qing. Murong Qi Qi was even too tired to pretend anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig cousin brother, help yourself. I\u2019m going to make up for my lost sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot pretending anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing was surprised my Murong Qi Qi\u2019s magnanimous. The eyes of this girl showed timid just now, at this moment, she is lazy as a cat. Only occasionally flashing some light, revealing her true nature. This was the real her!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig cousin brother is a smart man. Pretending in front of a smart man, isn\u2019t that really ridiculous?\u201d</p><br/><p>In this world, there are some people who are lucky. The moment they\u2019re born, they\u2019re superior to others and their wisdom is also unparalleled in the world. No matter how people acted in front of them, they knew what kind of face is hidden under the mask.</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing is such a person. Since he saw through her, she could better openly show herself, lest treated as a clown while she\u2019s still feeling triumphant.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf aunt saw the changes of lityle cousin sister, she would be very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing smiled. He really didn\u2019t see wrong. This girl has a pair of lively eyes and an appearance of a lazy cat. Not right, she is as rebellious as a leopard. It seemed that the future will not be so boring!</p><br/><p>1. Fu:residence</p><br/><p>2. Er: term of endearment </p><br/><p>3. Yuan: parts of a residence</p><br/><p>4.

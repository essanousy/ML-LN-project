It\u2019s princess who let this slave do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYong er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu never expected that Yong er would betray her so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYong er, bengong2 doesn\u2019t treat you badly, so why do you frame bengong? If bengong let you do it, why would bengong have to bear with such pain?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because she ate the breakfast this morning, Wanyan Bao Zhu also got diarrhea. Now, her face was terribly pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cServants, detain princess and the palace maid. Ji Xiang, let someone specially look after them. After the tournament is finished, benwang3 will re-trial this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t want to bother with this matter right now. Instead, he let Ji Xiang detain Wanyan Bao Zhu and Yong er separately. Now, he was most concerned about the health of the contestants. The tournament was imminent. The knockout competition would begin tomorrow. It would be very troublesome if the contestants couldn\u2019t participate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye4, I\u2019m afraid they can\u2019t participate in the tournament anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo shook his head. He prescribed a medicine and let people go get the ingredients.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe drug is too heavy. Tomorrow, they won\u2019t have any strength and there\u2019s no way they can participate in the tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, it\u2019s big trouble. From all the contestants, only Wanyan Kang was fine. What should they do?!</p><br/><p>At Meixiang yuan5, Feng Cang stood among the red plum flowers. With a lowered head, he thought about the knockout competition.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang intended to take a few of his people along to participate in the knockout competition. Although this might expose a part of his power, but this was the only way out. If it was a normal tournament, then he wouldn\u2019t have minded the outcome of the competition. However, this was related to his future happiness. Let it all be exposed! After all, he had tolerated for so long. It\u2019s time to expose!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Murong Qi Qi stepped onto the snow and moved towards Feng Cang. Out of habit, she nestled in his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, let me participate in the tournament!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was somewhat surprised at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s request. But aside from the surprise, he somewhat understood Murong Qi Qi\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, the tournament of the four countries is not a usual game. Hand this matter over to me. Don\u2019t worry, I will certainly get the first place of the tournament for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi held Feng Cang\u2019s hand and looked at him seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I sincerely want to participate in the tournament of the four countries! It\u2019s not for getting glory for the country. This has nothing to do with honor. I just want to personally win my happiness!\u201d</p><br/><p>It took only a moment, before Su Mei and Su Yue knew that Murong Qi Qi wanted to participate in the tournament. Seeing that their miss wanted to participate, these two also wanted to participate, but they were stopped by Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, quietly wait for the results. Could it be that you doubt my ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, subordinates don\u2019t dare. It\u2019s just that it has always been where miss goes, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll follow. This time, the tournament of the four countries is no joke. Subordinates are willing to follow at miss\u2019s side. Even if it\u2019s one more person, one more face without having to do anything is also alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Usually, Su Yue was calm and collected. What she usually said at key moments, would make people feel it\u2019s right. However, Murong Qi Qi had already made her decision and would not tolerate Su Mei and Su Yue\u2019s pleas.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told wangye, if I win, he must give me the Wind Chase Cliff as a dowry. Wangye agreed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei suddenly realized that this was the case, that Miss wanted to participate in the tournament for the Wind Chase Cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t need to worry. Nothing will happen to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi said it like that and her ability was also not ordinary, but this time, Su Yue gritted her teeth and adhered to her thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, Su Mei has quick reaction. If you want to go, you must take Su Mei with you. This subordinate will stay outside as backup. If miss doesn\u2019t take Su Mei with you, then Su Yue doesn\u2019t agree! Presumably, the brothers of Moyu will also disagree!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having Su Yue\u2019s words, Su Mei also insisted. In the end, Murong Qi Qi had no choice but to nod and take Su Mei with her.</p><br/><p>Although Feng Cang agreed on Murong Qi Qi participating, but he was also very worried. Only Murong Qi Qi and Wanyan Kang were not enough. After thinking about it, he also let Ruyi go.</p><br/><p>A day before the knockout competition, the contestants of Bei Zhou were finally set\u2026\u2026. Murong Qi Qi, Su Mei, Wanyan Kang and Ruyi. This team was formed at the last moment. Really don\u2019t know what would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, I know. Must certainly protect imperial sister-in-law\u2019s safety; don\u2019t let her lose even a strand of hair! I already know! You\u2019ve said it a hundred of times already!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, on the way to the tournament, when Feng Cang was about to open his mouth, Wanyan Kang immediately expressed all that Feng Cang wished to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy good cousin brother, she\u2019s your wangfei6, but I\u2019m your little cousin brother, ah! Why don\u2019t you care a bit more about me, this little cousin brother, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour life is lucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>One sentence from Feng Cang blocked Wanyan Kang deadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyi, did you see?! He hasn\u2019t even married her yet and he\u2019s already pampering her like this. In the future, if cousin-in-law enters the fu7, then wouldn\u2019t she be the biggest in wangfu8?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang put on a helpless expression. He shrugged his shoulders. His voice was exaggerated. His expression was even more exaggerated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, is fifth highness feeling uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the carriage, Murong Qi Qi heard Wanyan Kang\u2019s voice. She opened the curtain, revealing a lively small face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, fifth highness is not young anymore and needs to get married. It\u2019s time to find someone to control him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Murong Qi Qi said that, Feng Cang immediately pretended to ponder over it.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing is right. When we go back, I\u2019ll go look for uncle\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t! I was wrong! I was wrong, alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang immediately put on a bitter look.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, just now, it\u2019s this little brother\u2019s head which went into water and became confused! This little brother was wrong! This time, this little brother will closely follow behind cousin-in-law and protect cousin-in-law\u2019s safety without taking a single step away! As for the marriage, let\u2019s dismiss it. I haven\u2019t played enough yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the time he had been scammed by Murong Qi Qi in the palace, Wanyan Kang knew that this cousin-in-law was someone who could con people without blinking an eye. In any case, if she whispers in Feng Cang\u2019s ears and let him go ask Wanyan Lie to get a princess consort for him, then his free life would be gone! He didn\u2019t want to marry so early. He didn\u2019t want any women!</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Wanyan Kang say that coupled with his current expression, Su Mei laughed out loud, attracting Wanyan Kang\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang also had seen Su Mei before. However, she\u2019s Murong Qi Qi\u2019s maid. So, Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t carefully take note of her. Now looking at her, he discovered that this little girl was very lively and cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u2019</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang let the horse go to Su Mei\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be what I said was not right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei humphed lightly. She raised her chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur family\u2019s miss naturally has me to protect her. Fifth highness, if you don\u2019t meddle too much and provoke trouble, then we can thank the gods! How can we expect you to help?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The pride in Su Mei\u2019s eyes made Wanyan Kang surprised for a moment. This girl was interesting. Obviously, she\u2019s a maid, but she\u2019s so bold and dared to speak to him like that. She\u2019s more fun than those people from the palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, this little girl, how come you\u2019re so eloquent?! Could it be that if the master is like this, the slave is also like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, my family\u2019s miss is the best. Although, I\u2019m not even a tenth of miss, but compared to fifth highness, I\u2019m more than enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei wasn\u2019t modest. Every word she said, was a praise of Murong Qi Qi, making Wanyan Kang even more curious. Before, Murong Qi Qi beating Guli already made him very shocked. Now, whenever Su Mei mentioned Murong Qi Qi, she\u2019s so proud. What more did this pair of master and servant not shown yet?</p><br/><p>Although in his heart, he was thinking that, but his mouth was saying otherwise: \u201cTsk! Don\u2019t talk big! In the end, who is more powerful, we\u2019ll see at the knockout competition!</p><br/><p>\u201cCompete, then compete! Who is afraid of who?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s provocation directly stimulated Su Mei\u2019s desire to win.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen a certain someone loses, don\u2019t come crying with snot in your nose! Otherwise, the dignified fifth prince will lose face till your grandmother\u2019s home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang pointed at Su Mei. He \u2018you-ed\u2019 for a long time without saying any following words.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s a prince. Who, when seeing him, was not respectful and licked his butt? This only happened when he encountered Murong Qi Qi and her servant. He can accept the master bullying him. After all, next to Murong Qi Qi, there\u2019s the big mountain Feng Cang. He couldn\u2019t afford to offend that mountain. However, why was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s people also \u2018bullying\u2019 him like this? Moreover, why was it, whenever he was bullied, he was still very happy? Could it be that he had the tendency to like being abused?</p><br/><p>Seeing Wanyan Kang was no longer talking, Su Mei smiled proudly. Because of the cold weather, that pretty face was rosy. It looked more attractive. Coupled with that pair of shiny eyes, it made Wanyan Kang lose his soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? Have you never seen a beauty?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei glared at him after seeing Wanyan Kang stare at her, making her look more beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen beauties, but I\u2019ve never seen such a small pepper like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t notice that the sound of his voice had changed a bit. However, just because he didn\u2019t notice, doesn\u2019t mean that the others didn\u2019t hear the change.</p><br/><p>\u201cSmall pepper. Su Mei, this name matches you quite well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had been looking at the two. They\u2019ve been bickering the whole way. How come she felt that the way Wanyan Kang looked at Su Mie was quite not right? Could it be that she\u2019s too sensitive?</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei? Su Mei\u2026\u2026because of laziness, painting the eyebrow (mei). Good name. Good name!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Wanyan Kang say that, Su Mei was so angry her face turned red. Why was it that whenever he said her name, it felt so weird? How come this man was such a smooth talker and at the first look, he looked like a player prince?! A young master who only knows to dally around?! It seems that she needs to give him a little lesson!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Su Mei silently came to Wanyan Kang\u2019s back. With a whip, she whipped Wanyan Kang\u2019s horse\u2019s butt. The war horse became frightened. It spread its hooves and rushed forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, small pepper, you want to murder, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang grabbed the reins tightly. Although he was shouting exaggeratedly, but the actions of his hands were not bad. In just a moment, he controlled the manic horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, if you want to murder, please say it in advance. I\u2019ll clean my neck for you to cut it, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei\u2019s face turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cLecher! Ignoring you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei let the horse come next to the carriage. She talked with Murong Qi Qi in a low voice and didn\u2019t bother anymore with Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>Seeing that little girl\u2019s beautiful face and rosy cheeks, Wanyan Kang shook his head while smiling. In the end, she\u2019s just a little girl and couldn\u2019t stand provocation well. Interesting! Very interesting!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t know that unconsciously, on his mouth hung a naughty smile. And this smile, had been put into Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Without Su Mei\u2019s bickering, Wanyan Kang was a lot quieter. He was somewhat not used to this quietness. From time to time, he would look back at Su Mei. However, the other party ignored him, making Wanyan Kang get the feeling that he had lost face for the first time. He was actually looked down upon by a small maid. It seems that he must show his talent at the knockout competition!</p><br/><p>The venue of the knockout competition was at the pagoda that drove away evil spirits, located outside the city. Because the content was decided by Dong Lu, the location of the knockout competition was also selected by Dong Lu.</p><br/><p>This pagoda that drove away evil spirits was in a Buddha temple. The Buddha temple was made in a golden period during the former Qin. Later, because of the war, the temple was destroyed, leaving only a lonely \u2018drive away evil spirits\u2019 pagoda, which towered in the clouds.</p><br/><p>At this time, the contestants of the four countries have arrived.</p><br/><p>Bei Zhou had two men and two women. Xi Qi had the same as Bei Zhou. Aside from Long Duo and Helan Lian Yi, Nan Feng had five more people. As for Dong Lu, it had the most people.</p><br/><p>Dong Lu arrived last. Moreover, the contestants stayed at the house of embassy without revealing themselves. This time they came out, making Murong Qi Qi gain knowledge. Fifty people! A total of fifty people!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid cousin-in-law see? Dong Lu likes to use the tactic of a sea of people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery time, they are so shameless, wanting to tire people to death. Are the people of Dong Lu so cheap?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Su Mei heard that, she laughed. This person really spoke interestingly!</p><br/><p>\u201cMei er, why are you laughing? Don\u2019t be afraid of them! Rest assured, when I take action in a moment, I\u2019ll immediately take all of them down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Su Mei laugh like a flower, Wanyan Kang couldn\u2019t help himself from teasing her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Don\u2019t need! It\u2019ll be fine if I only follow our miss! Also, you\u2019re not allowed to call me Mei er. Did you hear?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei glared at Wanyan Kang once and stood behind Murong Qi Qi. Her mouth revealed a smile, completely not putting Wanyan Kang in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeihei!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being looked down upon, Wanyan Kang still laughed, making Su Mei feel that this fifth prince\u2019s mind was not so good.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, since the knockout competition is decided by Dong Lu, will they play favoritism?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi looked at Dong Lu\u2019s disposition of forces and then looked at the pagoda that drove away evil, she had some questions. Dong Lu had this many people. If they wanted to cheat, then wouldn\u2019t the other countries lose the decisive opportunity?</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Zhao Yang, please be assured. I can personally guarantee that the thing you worry about, won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Feng Cang to answer, a man\u2019s voice, full of confidence, reached over. A man in blue walked over from not far away.</p><br/><p>This man was wearing blue and liked blue like Jin Mo. However, Jin Mo\u2019s blue was the color of the sky and the blue on this man, was deep like the sea. On the blue clothes was waves embroidered with silver threads. There were also somersaulting koi. It looked very alive.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi raised her head and looked at the man. Long eyebrows, long and narrow phoenix eyes, tightly closed thin lips. He wasn\u2019t such a devilish beauty like Feng Cang and also didn\u2019t have Feng Cang\u2019s cold proudness. Instead, he looked easy going with a warm smile. He looked someone you can get close to.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jia Lan, the person who made the content of the knockout competition. The content of the knockout competition today is this pagoda that drives evil spirits away. Buddha has a seven level pagoda; humans have seven emotions and six desires. Each level of this pagoda has a different test. The ones who safely arrive at the top of the tower will be the finalists for the tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>The seven emotions of human: joy, anger, anxiety, thought, grief, fear and fright.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, there was someone who shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven level, is it then not seven rounds of test? Then, this knockout competition will be competing through seven games, ah?! In case no one passes, then what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one passing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan smiled. His smile was like a blooming Epiphyllum oxypetalum.</p><br/><p>Epiphyllum oxypetalum</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one passed, then there\u2019s no winner. Everyone loses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be like that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Jia Lan say that, everyone began to talk about it. Form outside the pagoda, there\u2019s no way to see inside it. Really made people curious about what kind of competition it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what method is used; no matter if you beat a friend or foe, as long as you can reach the top, then you\u2019re the winner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan\u2019s voice was full of temptation. His \u2018no matter if you beat a friend or foe\u2019 made Murong Qi Qi frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHearing your words, do you mean for us to massacre one another?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi quickly seized the meaning behind his words, Jia Lan couldn\u2019t help but have a deeper understanding of this little woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, you can\u2019t always do as you like. Every secret is inside the pagoda and since princess is a contestant, why don\u2019t you go inside and give it a try?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need you to say that. Naturally, I\u2019ll go!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Murong Qi Qi had an inexplicable feeling towards this pagoda where the knockout competition was being held. This pagoda was emitting a dangerous aura. What was inside there? Aside from this Jia Lan, no one knew. Also, his words of just now, obviously had the feeling of wanting to watch a play. Could it be that he would also watch the contestants of Dong Lu go die?</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter entering the pagoda, the door will be locked. You can only wait till someone passes the seven levels test and appear at the top, before the door will be opened.\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying this, Jia Lan maintained a gentle smile on his face. The smile was like a spring breeze in May. Warm, making people get lost in that smile and almost forget the chill in his words.</p><br/><p>What did this person mean with those words? Longze Jing Tian frowned. If no one passed, then didn\u2019t it mean that the door of this pagoda wouldn\u2019t be opened? Then wouldn\u2019t everyone be trapped inside and be starved to death? Is that what Jia Lan meant?</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who have regrets, there\u2019s still a chance to quit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that there\u2019s some hesitation, Jia Lan continued to smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no one who will quit, then please enter!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Misha\u2019s hands trembled slightly. He didn\u2019t hear wrongly. He\u2019d heard someone call him \u2018Lian Sheng\u2019!</p><br/><p>Misha turned around. He pushed the wheelchair forward slowly and went to the three people waiting. His expression was very excited, \u201cWho\u2019d just spoke? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, ah!\u201d The dark man standing in front laughed. \u201cWhat, is there a problem with what I said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you call me just now? Lian Sheng? How did you know? Who are you? Who\u2019s that old friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, I don\u2019t know.\u201d The dark man hiccuped and rubbed his tummy. \u201cBrothers, let\u2019s go! Let\u2019s find a place to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the dark man wanted to leave, Misha acted. Four plum darts flew from his sleeve and hit the ground in front of the tips of the dark man\u2019s feet. Now, Misha didn\u2019t have the innocence of before. He put on a cold and serious face, \u201cAnswer my question or die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, I\u2019m so scared!\u201d Misha\u2019s sudden action made the dark man surprised. Sure enough, leader (FC) wasn\u2019t wrong. These people were not easy to deal with. However, they were also not easy to deal with. A little plum dart was not enough to frighten them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do? You gave me such a scare, I don\u2019t remember anything anymore! What to do?\u201d The words of the dark man amused the two other people and made them laugh. \u201cBig brother, if you don\u2019t remember, don\u2019t think anymore! It\u2019s more interesting to think about beautiful women! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three people in front of him were obviously playing with him. Misha\u2019s lips trembled slightly. He also frowned, \u201cXia Xue, kill without pardon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s voice had just faded when Xia Xue\u2019s sword was unsheathed. A thin sword went straight to the dark man\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cA very ruthless lady!\u201d The dark man took out his sword and blocked the thin sword. \u201cIf you\u2019d killed your dark man (meaning himself), then you would have no man and would become a widow!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark man was obviously taking advantage of her with words and eat her tofu, making the suppressed anger in Xia Xue\u2019s heart burst out. \u201cLooking for death!\u201d The thin sword bloomed into a brilliant silver light in Xia Xue\u2019s hand. Xia Xue\u2019s figure was shrouded by the silver light of the sword. Every move was to take the life of the dark man.</p><br/><p>Eat tofu: taking advantage of the other in a sexual situation</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyaya, I didn\u2019t expect that this little lady with a cold face is so hot-tempered. It is really quite to this dark man\u2019s taste! I like little ladies whose outside and inside are different! Why don\u2019t you follow me?! Although I\u2019m not a great official, but I\u2019ve some land. It\u2019s just, there is already a shrew. If I bring you home, she would certainly create a big disturbance. So, I can only let you feel wronged and stay at the other house and become my thirteenth concubine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xia Xue\u2019s sword moves were arrogant, but the dark man didn\u2019t show any strenuousness. Instead, he blocked off Xia Xue\u2019s every attack. He still didn\u2019t forget to tease Xia Xue.</p><br/><p>As the great disciple of Penglai Island, Misha was quite respected at Penglai Island. As Misha\u2019s subordinate, at Penglai Island, no one dared to speak like this to Xia Xue. Now, it was great. She\u2019d met such an ugly, loutish, and lowly man who\u2019d said such insulting words. How could Xia Xue not feel hate? Especially since the dark man wanted to let her be the concubine. Moreover, it was the thirteenth. Xia Xue was so angry that she almost vomited blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue was wearing a white dress. The dark man was dressed in black. Two people, one white, one black, fought hard. The two other men watched them fight; they simply crossed their arms and watched the play at a side. They didn\u2019t forget to cheer on the dark man, \u201cBig brother, such a little lady as the sister-in-law, don\u2019t know if you can hold your own! Looking at her thin waist and big butt, she looks very fertile! It\u2019s just, we don\u2019t know who of the two would surrender to the other!\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of the two men made Xia Xue even more furious. She only had Misha in her heart. Compared to Misha, these people were dog shit!</p><br/><p>Xia Xue was being teased. Jin Yu wanted to help her ease her anger. He didn\u2019t wait for Jia Lan to open his mouth. He pulled his sword and jumped onto the two people who were watching the play. The moment the two saw that Jin Yu had made a move, they welcomed him laughingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, do you want to fight one on one or in a group?\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Jin Yu had already made the move to attack. After he heard the words from these two, he was surprised for a moment. \u201cOne on one? In a group?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, you don\u2019t even know this?! Do the people of Penglai Island have problems with their intelligence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! That must be it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two talked like there was no one around. The words they said were enough to make someone die from anger. \u201cListen, we will kindly tell you! A so-called one on one fight is you pick one of the two of us. As for the group fight, we two will fight against you!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were very familiar to Misha. Now, he was even more sure that the three people in front of him must know Yi Lian. Because Yi Lian had once teamed up with him to teach others a lesson. Only Yi Lian could say such words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your master? Is she called Yi Lian? Where is she? Did she let you come find me?\u201d Misha pushed the wheelchair excitedly towards the two big men. He had never expected that when he was looking for Yi Lian, Yi Lian was also looking for him. Could this be the so-called fate?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat one Lian or two Lians? Now, it\u2019s still spring. The lotus blooms only in the summer! Penglai Island\u2019s people have problems with their brains. It\u2019s really like that! Nuts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi is a homophone to \u2018one\u2019. Lian means lotus</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, nuts!\u201d The two were like they were comics cross-talking. Misha lowered his hand. A leather whip appeared in his hand. \u2018Hoo\u2026.\u2019 Misha was extremely fast. The leather whip split the air and made \u2018hoohoo\u2019 sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d One shouted, the other quickly dodged.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019 The two men, who had just been smiling, now looked more serious. Although the whip in Misha\u2019s hand looked like it was only as thick as two fingers, but the ground had been marked by this soft whip.</p><br/><p>\u201cEither tell me the whereabouts of Yi Lian or\u2026go die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Misha sat in a wheelchair, but the motion of his body was very nimble. This wheelchair seemed like it was his legs and it moved to and fro in the small venue. The whip continuously split the air in the sky and chased after the two men, making it so that they could only dodge.</p><br/><p>Danger! The two men exchanged a glance. They had long known that the people of Penglai Island were not ordinary. They didn\u2019t expect that even though Misha was physically disabled, his technique of the whip was so direct and efficient. Besides, it had full strength, making it so that they could only duck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa, pa, pa!\u2019</p><br/><p>The leather whip chased the two big men constantly. It was not far behind them. Every time, it only landed on their heels, so that they had half an inch distance to escape.</p><br/><p>This man did it deliberately! The men understood that Misha was only \u2018playing\u2019 with them and didn\u2019t act real. However, judging from the deep marks on the ground, such a control would let people blush from shame. If he had moved forward just a bit, the heels of both men would\u2019ve surely been broken by the whip.</p><br/><p>Jia Lan was baffled that they\u2019d suddenly began to fight. What Lian Sheng? Jia Lan seemed to have grasped some things, but he couldn\u2019t guess what kind of secret Misha was hiding.</p><br/><p>It was just, now someone had used their hands on Penglai Island\u2019s people. As someone from Penglai Island, he couldn\u2019t watch with folded arms. \u201cJin Yu, help Xia Xue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Jin Yu pulled his sword and came to Xia Xue\u2019s side. Jia Lan pulled his sword and went to Misha.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for your help!\u201d Seeing that Jia Lan wanted to help, Misha frowned. He didn\u2019t have the thoughts of killing these people. He only wanted to deter them and let them reveal the whereabouts of Yi Lian.</p><br/><p>Now, Misha was more than sure that these three certainly had something to do with Yi Lian. Because in this world only Yi Lian knew that he\u2019s called Lian Sheng. Yi Lian certainly let them say those words to him!</p><br/><p>If they were Yi Lian\u2019s people and he hurt them, then, when he meets Yi Lian, wouldn\u2019t it let her look very bad? He didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for Yi Lian. He wanted to have a good start with Yi Lian.</p><br/><p>Originally, Jia Lan wanted to help Misha capture the other parties. Although he didn\u2019t know what kind of secret Misha had, but looking at his expression, these three people must know something very important. Jia Lan wanted to help out. He didn\u2019t expect to be rejected by Misha. His face got red. He retrieved his sword and went to a side.</p><br/><p>Misha blurted those words just now. How could he not know that Jia Lan was helping him? However, he didn\u2019t have the time to apologize now. He only wanted to know who Yi Lain is. Where was Yi Lian?!</p><br/><p>At this side, the dark man dealt with Jin Yu and Xia Xue. At the other side, the two men somehow have no way to escape anymore because of the whip in Misha\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, do you think we should help?\u201d At the entrance of the restaurant, the beautiful lady boss and the servant watched the play with keen interest and pleasure. The servant saw that the fighting had become fierce, he was a bit excited. \u201cAfter all, they are considered one of our own. It would be a bit apologetic not helping, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t help!\u201d The young woman cracked the melon seeds and spit the shell. \u201cMiss married so casually. We still haven\u2019t tested what kind of person guye1 is! This is the opportunity to see the ability of these people. There are no poor soldiers under a good general. If they couldn\u2019t do it, then it means that guye also won\u2019t do! Besides, we\u2019ve already done what miss ordered. We\u2019ve put extra \u2018seasoning\u2019 in their food. Miss didn\u2019t say to let us do something more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that the woman next to him was still brooding about Feng Qi Qi marrying Feng Cang, the servant grinned, \u201cThe one miss has set her eyes on wouldn\u2019t be bad! But, you\u2019re right! We only listen to miss. We will do what miss has said. What miss didn\u2019t say, we should just watch the play.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people from Moyu talked like there was no one around. Their voices weren\u2019t loud, but which one on the scene wasn\u2019t an expert in martial arts? Although they were fighting fiercely on the scene, but all the words of these two people fell into their ears.</p><br/><p>After the dark man blocked Jin Yu\u2019s and Xia Xue\u2019s attack, he couldn\u2019t help himself from looking at the woman who was cracking melon seeds at the entrance. It seemed that these two people must be master\u2019s wife\u2019s people! They obviously said those words for them to hear! This master\u2019s wife was fascinating. She actually had such interesting subordinates.</p><br/><p>At Misha\u2019s side, after he heard \u2018miss\u2019 and \u2018guye\u2019, he immediately retrieved the whip. Who was the miss they\u2019d talked about? Could it be Yi Lian? And who was guye? Yi Lian had married? No! Impossible! Yi Lian wouldn\u2019t marry! Yi Lian was his bride. She\u2019s his!</p><br/><p>\u2018Shua\u2026\u2019 A gust of wind swept over. The servant did a back roll and the lady boss grabbed and gripped Misha\u2019s whip in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! You like to attack in surprise, ah!\u201d The lady boss rolled the leather whip in her hand. She revealed a tempting smile. \u201cLittle brother, I don\u2019t like little boys like you. Too tender! Big sister likes men who\u2019re a bit older. Old grass could match my strength! You ah, don\u2019t have any ideas about big sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the lady boss finished, she pulled with her hand and directly moved Misha and the wheelchair two meters forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I will return this whip to you! Next time, don\u2019t engage in such surprise attacks anymore. Women care the most about their appearance! If you destroy big sister\u2019s countenance of a flower and face like the moon appearance, big sister will kill you and make wine out of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The whip went the same way back. The strength was three times of Misha\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cMisha, careful!\u201d Jia Lan saw that Misha was sitting there blankly, and shouted; he ran forward and grabbed the leather whip.</p><br/><p>\u201cMisha, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Seeing Misha\u2019s blank expression, Jia Lan was startled. Just now, he\u2019d also heard the words of those two people. They put extra \u2018seasoning\u2019 in their food. What is this extra seasoning? Could it be poison? Could it be that the poison on Misha\u2019s body had acted?</p><br/><p>Misha didn\u2019t bother with Jia Lan\u2019s concern. Instead, he had been looking at the woman in front of him, \u201cWho is the miss you talked about? Is it Yi Lian? She\u2026she has married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026,\u201d Hearing Misha ask this, the lady boss smiled and twisted her legs. \u201cHehe, our miss is Yi Lian and she has already married. Miss let me pass a sentence to you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sentence? What does Yi Lian want to tell me?!\u201d Misha\u2019s mood was like the tide of the sea now. Knowing that Yi Lian had come to this era, he should be happy. However, she actually didn\u2019t wait for him. She\u2019d actually married someone else! How could he accept this?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss said, she will never forgive you, Lian Sheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Guye: son-in-law, used by wife\u2019s family</p><br/>\n</div>"}

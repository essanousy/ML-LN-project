Grandma Li in the next room had also been scared and run over here. She repeatedly asked, \u201cWhat had happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the smoke was cleared, Xia Xue saw Misha sitting on the floor. Wasn\u2019t he asleep? When did he get out of bed? Seeing that Misha used his hands to support his body, Xia Xue quickly went over to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, what had happened? Why did you come out of bed? If there was anything, you could\u2019ve called me, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF**** off\u2026,\u201d Misha gestured with his hand. The wind in his right-hand palm hit the unprepared Xia Xue to the ground. \u201cBitch! You actually delayed my time and put Lingyi herb in my medicine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Misha say that, Xia Xue knew that what he and Li Da said just now was heard by Misha. She couldn\u2019t care about wiping the blood from her mouth. Xia Xue immediately knelt in front of Misha, \u201cYoung master, please listen to my explanation! You were seriously injured. If you insisted on going to Dong Lu, if your wound got infected on the road, it would endanger your life, ah! This slave considered from the point of your health and had to come up with this plan. This slave did it for you, young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned you!\u201d The more Misha listened, the angrier he got. It seemed that everything was true. He actually wasted so much time here. He didn\u2019t know how the situation was now in Dong Lu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s this slave\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t be angry! If you want to punish, then punish this slave\u2026,\u201d Xia Xue didn\u2019t finish, when another wave of wind from a hand palm came at her. Xia Xue fell on the ground once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come lie to me with those high-sounding reasons! You just don\u2019t want me to go to Dong Lu. You just don\u2019t want me to see Yi Lian! So, you repeatedly stopped me! Did you think that I don\u2019t know what you are thinking? Want to become my woman? Are you worthy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s whole body trembled. He had never thought that Xia Xue would do such a thing, \u201cSay, what date is it now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s aggressiveness completely stunned grandma Li and Li Da. After hearing Misha did they found out the reason. Xia Xue was not this young handsome man\u2019s wife. She\u2019s his slave! They were lied to by Xia Xue?!</p><br/><p>Seeing that Misha was not to be trifled with, grandma Li quickly answered in Xia Xue\u2019s stead, \u201cIt\u2019s already mid-June\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Misha cold eyes casted her a glance, making grandma Li shiver from fear. She almost fell. It was Li Da who supported her. \u201cSay it once again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, it\u2019s already mid-June\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, very good! Very good!\u201d Misha looked fiercely at Xia Xue. The hatred in his eyes was apparent.</p><br/><p>Xia Xue knew that Misha must hate her to death. She didn\u2019t think that her own \u2018act on her initiative\u2019 would let Misha be so disgusted, \u201cYoung master, I was wrong! I know I\u2019m wrong! Young master, give me one more chance! I really just want you to recuperate well, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue wanted to come forward but had once again been hit to the ground.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xia Xue like this, Li Da couldn\u2019t help but stand up and berated Misha, \u201cNo matter what miss Xia Xue did wrong, it was for your body, it was for your own good! How can you bite the hands that feed you?! When you were in a coma, it was miss Xia Xue who took care of you without rest. Even if you\u2019re angry, you should think about the good things about her. How can you treat her, a girl, like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Da\u2019s berating made Misha\u2019s face got darker. He stared long at Li Da. He suddenly laughed, \u201cSince you want to come up for her so much, then, I will let you see the true face of this woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing speaking, Misha gestured with his finger at Xia Xue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, forgive me!\u201d She couldn\u2019t care less about the pain on her body and crawled to Misha. With a face of begging like a Pekinese dog, she looked at Misha, \u201cYoung master, as long as you forgive me, I\u2019m willing to do anything for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Misha smiled innocently. The black eye-patch on his left eye made him look even more like a rebirthed devil with a na\u00efve smile, but there was a deep coldness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them! Kill them, then, I will forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha pointed at Li Da and grandma Li and smiled gently at Xia Xue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master\u2026,\u201d Xia Xue\u2019s heart shivered. If it wasn\u2019t because of grandma Li and Li Da, they wouldn\u2019t have survived. However, now Misha\u2019s demand was to kill them. How could she do it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, don\u2019t want to part with your accomplice?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Misha\u2019s cold voice with a trace of heartlessness reached Xia Xue\u2019s ears, she couldn\u2019t help but shudder. With her understanding of Misha, if she doesn\u2019t do it, he will kill them himself and also punish her accordingly. She didn\u2019t want to lose Misha\u2019s trust!</p><br/><p>Xia Xue clenched her teeth. She stood up and walked to Li Da, \u201cGrandma Li, Li Da, sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue\u2019s appearance clearly looked like that she wanted to kill them. This made grandma Li and Li Da greatly shocked, \u201cMother, be careful!\u201d Li Da carried grandma Li on his back and run to the outside. However, he didn\u2019t run out of the yard, Xia Xue flashed and was already in front of them.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xia Xue\u2019s gentle look disappeared. She was cold as ice. Her original look returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d A hatchet appeared in Xia Xue\u2019s hands. A light flashed. On Li Da\u2019s neck appeared a smear of blood. The red blood was like a fountain and sprayed all over the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest, eldest\u2026\u201d Li Da\u2019s body slowly fell on the ground. Grandma Li also rolled to the ground. Seeing her son dying tragically, grandma Li began to shout, \u201cCome, ah! Murder! Come ah! Murder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chinese people usually call their sons according to their rank of birth. Since Li Da is the only child, she would call him Eldest</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t shout the second murder yet, when grandma Li had fallen in a pool of blood. Like Li Da, grandma Li was also killed with one stroke.</p><br/><p>Looking at the two people who fell on the ground, thinking about how they lived together these past two months, Xia Xue\u2019s heart hurt very much. However, if she didn\u2019t do it like this, she would lose Misha\u2019s trust. Compared to Misha, Li Da and grandma Li were nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Misha didn\u2019t feel anything about these two people\u2019s death. They lied to him. They deserved to be killed! They delayed his time and he didn\u2019t know the situation of Dong Lu now. Dong Lu can\u2019t lose. He needs to stop Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Xia Xue searched through the house and found some money grandma Li kept including that golden hairpin. She put them away in her chest. She also took some food. Finally, she dragged the two people\u2019s corpses to the room. A fire burned down the place where they lived for two months.</p><br/><p>Behind was a blazing fire. Xia Xue carried Misha on her back and left without looking back.</p><br/><p>On the road, Xia Xue hired a carriage. They rushed for half a month. Early July, they arrived at Dong Lu.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Misha heard many things about Feng Cang. For example, Feng Cang utterly defeated Hu Xue Sen in just half a month. Dong Lu withdraw the troops from Pingyi, Gaoyang and Jinyuan. But Feng Cang wasn\u2019t \u2018satisfied\u2019 with Dong Lu\u2019s withdrawal of the troops. Instead, he pursued the retreating enemy and went all the way to the abdomen of Dong Lu, making it so that Dong Lu could only resist.</p><br/><p>At this time, princess Zhen Guo led two hundred thousand soldiers as reinforcement. Feng Cang captured the city as a leading figure. Feng Qi Qi immediately occupied the territory. The two coordinated perfectly. It seemed like they had the intention to devour Dong Lu. Ever since Feng Cang led the army till now, in just two and a half short months, Dong Lu already lost two thirds of it\u2019s cities.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy! Crazy!\u201d Getting these messages, Misha couldn\u2019t help but curse.</p><br/><p>In two and half month, not only did Feng Cang cut off the heads of Hu Xue Sen and Dong Lu\u2019s emperor Xia Jin, he also occupied more than half the territory of Dong Lu. How crazy was this person to be able to do such a thing?!</p><br/><p>What others couldn\u2019t complete in a year or so, when it came to Feng Cang, it was like a child\u2019s play. It happened that Feng Qi Qi was his partner. He attacked, she occupied and defended the city. This couple was simply a golden combination.</p><br/><p>What was odder was Xi Qi. Now, Longze Yu and Longze Jing Tian was also badly burned about the head. Feng Xie\u2019s \u2018coming back from death\u2019 was unexpected to them. Longze Yu put more than half of the military power on dealing with Bei Zhou and Feng Xie. He didn\u2019t expect that Nan Feng suddenly gave them a surprise attack and caught them unprepared.</p><br/><p>Since most of the military was in the east, dealing with Bei Zhou; when the north was met with Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s three hundred thousand soldiers, Xi Qi\u2019s army could only retreat in defeat. Longze Jing Tian wanted to mobilize the army back to reinforce, he didn\u2019t expect that Feng Xie only used a small amount of the army and let them have no spare time for a separate task. He didn\u2019t dare to retreat. Until now, Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s side almost reached Xi Qi\u2019s capital, Xiliang.</p><br/><p>\u201cA good relieve a besieged ally by attacking the home base of the besiegers! A good threaten the east and strike to the west!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha was now surer that Ming Yue Cheng deployed his army like this because he reached an agreement with Bei Zhou. Looking at Ming Yue Cheng, it seemed that wanted to waste time with Xi Qi. Could it be that Nan Feng and Bei Zhou would like to take this opportunity to divide the mainland and let Dong Lu and Xi Qi become history?</p><br/><p>Misha only cursed Feng Cang for being a war madman. He didn\u2019t know that after Feng Cang got to know that the fetal poison in his body was Forget Love, he wanted to end the war very much. Only after the war is ended, could he go to Penglai Island to cure the poison.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was afraid that if the time was dragged for too long, it would let him forget Feng Qi Qi before he could go to Penglai Island. So, aside from the necessarily rest and to get ready, he would be in combat mode. Quickly take down Dong Lu was the thing Feng Cang wanted to do the most.</p><br/><p>At this point, Feng Cang\u2019s army was getting closer and closer to Dong Lu\u2019s capital, Yuchu.</p><br/><p>Xia Jin already died under Feng Cang\u2019s sword. Without a monarch, Dong Lu was in a great mess. Because when Xia Jin was alive, he didn\u2019t establish a crown prince, so even if Feng Cang\u2019s soldiers were at the city walls and although Dong Lu lost two-third of its territory, Dong Lu\u2019s princes haven\u2019t realized that the danger had come. Instead, they were more concerned who would ascend the throne.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards! Till now, you are still fighting? If you continue to fight like this, you\u2019re all about to become refugees from a destroyed country!\u201d The empress dowager Jun Lan Xin looked at the five princes who refused to accept the other. She shivered from anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo-third of the territory is gone. Soon, Bei Zhou\u2019s army will come to our Yuchu. You are still fighting here over the throne. Don\u2019t you feel ashamed?! Can you have a clear conscience when facing your ancestors, when facing your dead emperor father?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Lan Xin being like this, fourth prince Xia Zheng well-behavedly came to his imperial grandmother and massaged her shoulders, \u201cImperial grandmother, you\u2019re right! Now, it\u2019s time for our brothers to work with a common purpose and deal unanimously against the outsiders! If we continue to fight like this, Dong Lu will be gone! We must unite!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still Zheng er1 who is sensible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all because imperial grandmother taught well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Zheng\u2019s words were very much to Jun Lan Xin\u2019s liking. Besides, this imperial grandson was her favorite. Seeing these two echo one another, eldest prince Xia Qi was not happy, \u201cImperial grandmother, although the words were said like that, but still one person need to be recommended to preside over the overall situation! Otherwise, both sides would claim they\u2019re right, wouldn\u2019t agree with each other and fight till our heads are broken and blood are flowing. Wouldn\u2019t this let the outsiders laugh at us?! I think, we should first determine who is the heir to the throne!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight! Eldest brother is right! After setting the new emperor, the citizens and the generals would be at ease. Everyone would have a pillar to lean on and would also fight against outsiders! By then, not to mention reclaim our cities. Even defeating Bei Zhou is possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Qi\u2019s words received the other three princes\u2019 support. Seeing the other imperial grandson take a different position from her under Xia Qi\u2019s lead, Jun Lan Xin\u2019s expression became dark, \u201cYour words make sense, but who should become the emperor? You fought for so many days and didn\u2019t came with a result. Could it that you want to continue to waste time like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, Dong Lu\u2019s citizens are living between water and fire and are struggling under the iron heel of Bei Zhou! You are unwilling to make concessions, could it be that you want to become prisoners and let Dong Lu become Bei Zhou?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Lan Xin said this, she was emotionally agitated. Even the emerald in the phoenix mouth on the phoenix crown shook.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk\u2026 how come I heard that those citizens in the cities very much welcomed Bei Zhou people? I heard that Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Zhen Guo Feng Qi Qi issued a Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention and was very popular amongst the citizens. Some also said that the citizens weren\u2019t disturbed by the war at all. Feng Qi Qi also promised them a ten-year tax exemption. Those who fled their hometown, now have gone back. Feng Qi Qi had long pacified them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, a military doctrine issued in 1928 by Mao Zedong for the Red Army, which included a number of injunctions demanding high standards of behavior and respect for civilians during wartime</p><br/><p>The one who spoke was second prince Xia Yu. Jun Lan Xin\u2019s lips trembled from anger. Her finger pointed at Xia Yu. She could care less about her identity as empress dowager and scolded.</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Yu, you\u2019re Dong Lu\u2019s prince. How could you speak up for the enemy\u2019s country? Since you say that Bei Zhou was so good, why don\u2019t you go to Bei Zhou? Your attitude is like this, your thoughts is like this, aren\u2019t you selling the country?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial grandmother, words couldn\u2019t be said like this. Who could let the people live well will be supported by the people. Since ancient times, it had been like his. Feng Qi Qi could be like this, I fell that she\u2019s very good. She\u2019s a heroine. She could be e compared favourably with men in terms of ability. She deserves to be admired!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Er: term of endearment</p><br/>\n</div>"}

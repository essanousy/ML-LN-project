Humph, no wonder this person was so proud. He had such an ability! His inner energy was already at the white level eight. This person couldn\u2019t be overlooked. It seemed that it had been a very long time since there was someone with the white level eight inner energy who\u2019d appeared in this mainland. Who was this person?</p><br/><p>This time, it was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s turn to stand there without moving. Before, she made the moves just to test the bottom line of the man in white with the silver mask. Now that she\u2019d discovered the ability of the other party, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t move again. She only stood quietly neither far nor near, just ten meters opposite Feng Cang in the night.</p><br/><p>A duel between experts; the one who makes the first move, would be the one who loses. Feng Cang understood this. Murong Qi Qi also understood this.</p><br/><p>At this time, two powerful airs surrounded the two people and formed a shallow whirlpool. Those people in black who had been originally thrown to the ground by Murong Qi Qi stood up and left the scene. They clearly knew that if at this time, they appeared around these two people, they would become ashes.</p><br/><p>Through the white porcelain mask, Murong Qi Qi looked coldly at the man with the silver mask. She wanted to solve the confusion in her heart. \u201cI want to ask you one thing. Why did you touch my people and burned down my Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang?! I have neither animosity nor hatred with you. Since it\u2019s like this, there must be a reason. I want to know that reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he heard Murong Qi Qi say Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai had been burned, Nalan Xin was startled. He didn\u2019t let people do such a thing. He only let people kidnap the people and didn\u2019t let them do those overboard things. Even though he\u2019d captured Fang Tong, he didn\u2019t torture him for information. He used a civilized and peaceful way. What was Murong Qi Qi talking about?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been tempted by my woman!\u201d Hearing Guanghua gongzi 1 ask, Feng Cang also no longer hid it and said the reason.</p><br/><p>The cold faint words of the other party almost let Murong Qi Qi spurt out blood. Her orientation as a woman had always been very normal. She loves men. She loves Feng Cang. When did the person she loved turn into a woman?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere must be some misunderstanding here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no misunderstanding! My woman has been silently concerned about you. Everyone knows about you and her matter. You still say there isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone from the jianghu2 said that Guanghua gongzi and Du Xian Er were a pair of immortals. Everyone knew about this, yet Guanghua gongzi had actually denied it. He really didn\u2019t shoulder the responsibility! Feng Cang looked down upon the man in red even more. He (FC) thought he (GH) was a coward.</p><br/><p>If Guanghua gongzi had admitted that he loved Murong Qi Qi, that he liked Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang would\u2019ve admired him and would think he had good taste. He didn\u2019t expect that the other party would deny it directly. Wasn\u2019t this failing the affection Murong Qi Qi had for him?!</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi felt completely wronged.</p><br/><p>It was undeniable that whenever she appeared as Guanghua gongzi, she was indeed very popular among women and got the favor of women. However, she was a normal woman and didn\u2019t have a special liking and also didn\u2019t have an alternative orientation. She never had a close contact with any woman. The man in white with a silver mask\u2019s words were extremely absurd and ridiculous in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, did you make a mistake? I admit I am tall, rich and handsome, have money and am charming, but I am not a casual person. If it\u2019s your woman\u2019s wishful thinking, then you couldn\u2019t treat me as a firecracker because of her unrequited love!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tall, rich and handsome: Mr. Perfect. In China, the perfect husband material should be tall, rich and handsome. The importance is also in that order. A husband needs to be tall first.</p><br/><p>Tall, rich and handsome\u2026After this was said, Nalan Xin couldn\u2019t help but cough twice. Guanghua gongzi was indeed very rich. As for the appearance, rumor had it that he was godlike. So, that shouldn\u2019t be bad. As for the height, according to Guanghua gongzi\u2019s small body, this word seemed inappropriate.</p><br/><p>Guanghua gongzi using \u2018wishful thinking\u2019 to describe Murong Qi Qi made Feng Cang explode completely. His woman, the treasure he cares about, the flesh of his heart, in the other party\u2019s eyes, turned out to be so disdainful!</p><br/><p>Thinking about how anxious Murong Qi Qi was after knowing something had happened to Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang, Feng Cang felt that he (GH) was not worthy of Murong Qi Qi. She was so concerned for Guanghua gongzi, but the other party used \u2018unrequited love\u2019 to send her away. Really enough is enough!</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d The figure in white flew like a sword towards Murong Qi Qi. The killing intent in the black eyes behind the silver mask was very strong.</p><br/><p>Just now, Feng Cang had regretted ruining Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai, making Murong Qi Qi sad; but now, after seeing this \u2018bastard\u2019 in red, all the guilt had disappeared. This man deserved a good spanking. He (GH) actually insulted his (FC) treasure. He deserves to be killed!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi returned two sneers to the other party. If you want to condemn someone, then don\u2019t worry about the pretext! Casually find a shabby reason to ruin her efforts and kidnap her people. Could it be that he thinks she\u2019s a dope and could be bullied by anybody?!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding ling ling\u2026\u2019 Feng Cang was in the sky; Murong Qi Qi stood on the ground. One in red, one in white. It was truly beautiful. The dagger in Feng Cang\u2019s hand stabbed mercilessly towards Murong Qi Qi\u2019s neck. But it hadn\u2019t reached her yet, when it was wrapped by the golden silk. With a sound of the bell, a purple smoke sprayed on Feng Cang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Despicable! Feng Cang turned to escape the purple smoke. Guanghua gongzi had actually used poison! As the purple smoke fell on the ground, the stones melted instantly. Feng Cang hated the man in red in front of him even more. Guanghua gongzi\u2019s poison was definitely given to him by Murong Qi Qi. While he enjoyed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s benefits, he trampled Murong Qi Qi\u2019s feelings. This man is despicable!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was also very surprised. That attack with the dagger of just now was with full power. If it wasn\u2019t because she had long prepared against it, even if going head-on, she would\u2019ve gotten injured. This man had the intention to kill? Because of an excuse which she was unable to make heads or tails of it? Really too shameless, really a bastard!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi was also too lazy to say any more nonsense. The golden threads swayed; the golden bells rang and attacked Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>For a time, the people watching were dazzled by the scene in front of them. The left and right hands of the man in red were extremely flexible. Five fingers hooked on the thread as though the fingers had given life to the threads; directing the golden threads to attack their master Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Now, Nalan Xin also put the matter of burning Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai to the back of his head. He didn\u2019t have time to think about who the black-handed master behind it was. His gaze focused on Feng Cang and Guanghua gongzi and watched them fight.</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since he had seen his master fight. Today, this Guanghua gongzi and his master were quite evenly matched. Nalan Xin was somewhat exited. The loneliness of a high-skilled person was a sad thing for Feng Cang. At least, Nalan Xin thought that.</p><br/><p>Although master\u2019s body was weak, but this didn\u2019t mean that he was weak. Otherwise, how could he take charge of the eagle troop at the age of fifteen, swept through the northern nomadic people and let Bei Zhou\u2019s army become the most powerful army in this mainland?</p><br/><p>However, Nalan Xin looked for half a day and discovered that this Guanghua gongzi was also a rare young talent in this world. When he (NX) let himself go all the way, he could take twenty attacks of Feng Cang. However, this Guanghua gongzi actually fought more than a hundred rounds with wangye3 using only two soft silk threads. If it wasn\u2019t because he was not someone ordinary, how could he do it?!</p><br/><p>Speaking of this, the woman was to blame. Two outstanding men fought for an outstanding woman. Naturally, there would be contradiction between them. It was just; he didn\u2019t know who would win. He\u2019d rather Feng Cang wins, but looking at the situation now, it\u2019s possible that they would have a draw.</p><br/><p>In the air, the red and white figure intertwined. While exchanging blows with Guanghua gongzi, Feng Cang suddenly smelled a familiar green apple fragrance. It was just, why would this fragrance appear on Guanghua gongzi\u2019s body? Could it be that their relationship already went so well?</p><br/><p>Thinking about the little woman that he kissed may have been embraced by this despicable man in front of him, the strength in his hand intensified ten times.</p><br/><p>Shameless bastard! Obviously, it was he who was unreasonable and yet, he was still so aggressive!</p><br/><p>Sensing Feng Cang\u2019s outbreak, Murong Qi Qi was also not polite. A black dagger appeared in her hand and cut off Feng Cang\u2019s sleeve. The dagger went close to Feng Cang\u2019s skin and stabbed towards his wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! A big man who is like a woman.\u201d Guanghua gongzi was fast, Feng Cang was faster. He grabbed Guanghua gongzi\u2019s wrist. After touching the other party, Feng Cang discovered that the other party\u2019s wrists were slim like a woman\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Being touched by another man, Murong Qi Qi was furious. She\u2019s Feng Cang\u2019s. How could she allow someone aside from Feng Cang to touch her. This man was really a bastard!</p><br/><p>Because of flying into a rage out of humiliation, Murong Qi Qi also forgot her strokes. Instinctively, she kicked the underbody of the silver masked man. The other party didn\u2019t let go. His other free hand caught Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ankle.</p><br/><p>With a grasp, Feng Cang was puzzled. Where was there a man with such a small skeleton? Even the ankle was so slim like a woman\u2019s\u2026</p><br/><p>A girl? Feng Cang suddenly looked up from surprise. Looking at the beautiful white cat mask in front of him, he didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s other hand would slap him straight on his silver mask, \u201cStinky rogue!\u201d</p><br/><p>A \u2018pa\u2026\u2019 sound made everyone\u2019s mind went blank and also woke Feng Cang up. This voice and also this tone; plus this small hand, if this wasn\u2019t Murong Qi Qi, then who else could it be?!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing?\u201d Feng Cang didn\u2019t know what kind of words he should use to describe his feelings now. Shocked? Foolishly frightened? Surprised? Overflown with happiness\u2026 (Alright, in fact, it\u2019s rabbit who couldn\u2019t describe it).</p><br/><p>\u201cQing your sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party not only controlled her hand and foot. He also used the way Feng Cang called her to call her. This let Murong Qi Qi become angrier. Her leg flew to the man in white\u2019s chest. The other party fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard! I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Looking at the foolish smile on the silver masked man\u2019s face, the golden thread in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand danced and flew towards Feng Cang\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d Nalan Xin looked at the foolish Feng Cang and screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss! Have mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, Su Mei, Su Yue and Fang Tong had also arrived. Su Yue was anxious. The dart in her hand directly interrupted the direction of the golden thread.</p><br/><p>\u2018Boom!\u2019 Only after Feng Cang heard the loud noise, did he wake up. He jumped up like a carp, \u201cQing Qing, you want to murder your husband, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing your\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t finish and looked startled at the man opposite her for a moment. It turned out that, the slap from just now moved Feng Cang\u2019s silver mask a bit and revealed his pair of devilishly beautifully smiling eyes, \u201cCang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, Feng Cang didn\u2019t know what to say. Su Mei and Su Yue rushed to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side. One on the left and the other on the right, both checked her body. \u201cMiss, are you alright?! Miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi also became foolish now. What kind of situation was this? How did the other party become Feng Cang?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Qing Qing!\u201d Feng Cang took down the mask and revealed his face. It was just, on Feng Cang devilishly beautifully face was now a look of disbelief and surprise. He reached out. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t reject and let Feng Cang take down that white porcelain cat mask, revealing the face he was familiar with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be you?!\u201d Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t close her small mouth. She could only look blankly at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Guanghua gongzi?\u201d Although Feng Cang wanted to suppress his excitement, but his trembling voice still betrayed his heart. What exactly was going on? Murong Qi Qi was actually Guanghua gongzi? How could this be? Was Guanghua gongzi not a man\u2026?</p><br/><p>However, with a closer look, Feng Cang discovered the correlation. Since Murong Qi Qi could be Lian gongzi, why couldn\u2019t she be Guanghua gongzi? She liked to cross-dress and disguise as a man. For her, it was more convenient to move in the jianghu and also facilitate her work!</p><br/><p>Looking at Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang suddenly giggled. What was he doing? What kind of vinegar was he eating? Guanghua gongzi and Murong Qi Qi were the same person. He actually almost let the vinegar flood the whole capital for the same person? And also let Nalan Xin do such a ridiculous thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Feng Cang suddenly remembered Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai which had been burned by Nalan Xin\u2026This time, he\u2019s (FC) in big trouble. He destroyed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s effort. How should he compensate this?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was in a daze for a long time. Only when she saw Fang Tong, did Murong Qi Qi recover. \u201cUncle Fang, are you alright?! And the other brothers?! How are they? What happened? Who burned Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi came alone to Lion Ridge to save him, Fang Tong was very excited. Only just now, when his servant and Su Yue came looking for him, did he find out what had happened at Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai. This was really too strange!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, this is the case.\u201d Seeing nothing had happened to Murong Qi Qi, Fang Tong let out a sigh of relief. Then, he reported how the situation was at that time to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>It turned out that today, Tong Bao Zhai had opened like usual. When the morning passed halfway, suddenly a group of people came looking for trouble at Tong Bao Zhai. Talking till here, Fang Tong especially looked once at Feng Cang. \u201cThey weren\u2019t guye\u2019s4 people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong\u2019s \u2018guye\u2019 let Feng Cang\u2019s nervous heart calmed down a bit. It seemed that the personality of this old man wasn\u2019t bad. Although they had brought him over to here, but he didn\u2019t turn right from wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was Wu Ji Gong\u2019s people. The ones who came with them were the guards of the capital. With the excuse of searching for fugitives, they arrested our people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ji Gong? The guards of the capital? Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi narrowed their eyes at the same time. Behind Wu Ji Gong was the crown prince. They knew this. Besides, the army was used. It seemed that there was definitely someone behind this.</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, there was a dispute and we fought. According to miss, when meeting with trouble, protecting the lives of the brothers was the most important. Moreover, ordinary people shouldn\u2019t fight with officials. We hadn\u2019t figured out the matter yet. We couldn\u2019t go head to head with the court. So, this subordinate, according to the usual way, let the brothers retreat.\u201d</p><br/><p>After everyone retreated, Wu Ji Gong\u2019s people found it dull. They smashed and robbed for a while and then left. Not long after, Fang Tong came back to look at the situation. Unexpectedly, he had encountered Nalan Xin. Although, he was strong, but Nalan Xin seemed to be one level higher and captured him to bring him here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation was like this. As for what miss said, Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai being burned, this subordinate indeed doesn\u2019t know who did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying this, Fang Tong looked at Nalan Xin as if wanting him to give an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you do it?\u201d Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to open her mouth, Su Yue came to Nalan Xin and looked at him with disbelief, \u201cThat day, meeting you at Tong Bao Zhai\u2019s entrance wasn\u2019t accidental, was it? You were following me, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026,\u201dFacing Su Yue\u2019s questioning, Nalan Xin didn\u2019t deny.</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit that I followed you. However, I really didn\u2019t let people burn down Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai! When I went, the store was in a mess. At Jue Se Fang, I saw this elder and invited him over. I really didn\u2019t do the other things! Wangye only said to bring the people here and didn\u2019t say to set it on fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>A \u2018wangye\u2019 let Murong Qi Qi\u2019s gaze turn to Feng Cang. She slowly walked to Feng Cang, raised her head and looked seriously at Feng Cang, \u201cCang, don\u2019t you think you should explain this matter? Why do you need to kidnap my people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Feng Cang laughed embarrassingly. How to let him say it? Could he say to Murong Qi Qi: because of you, I\u2019ve eaten your vinegar? Isn\u2019t this a tongue-twister\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk!\u201d Murong Qi Qi snapped. Nalan Xin\u2019s heart almost jumped out.</p><br/><p>Just now, when he got to know that Guanghua gongzi was actually Murong Qi Qi, Nalan Xin wanted to die. What a thing! Wangye ate vinegar for whatever reason and caused him (NX) to offend wangfei.5 How should he spend his days in the future? Why did all unlucky things fall on him?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI was jealous.\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s voice was very small as if he was afraid that others would hear.</p><br/><p>After hearing that the person in red was a woman and that she was the new wife master had taken, the spectating underlings beside Feng Cang all raised their thumbs in their hearts for Murong Qi Qi. Only such a woman was worthy of their master! This hot temper, this powerful personality and also those vicious attacks, all showed that she was the woman heaven had arranged for Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Now, it seemed surging waters flooded the Dragon King Temple, a family member didn\u2019t know the other family member. Now, there\u2019s a good play to watch! These people had forgotten how Murong Qi Qi fiercely taught them a lesson just now. Now, they formed a circle and wanted to see if mistress would \u2018teach a lesson\u2019 to their master.</p><br/><p>Surging waters flooded the Dragon King Temple: a dispute between close people who fail to recognize each other</p><br/><p>\u201cLouder!\u201d Not waiting for Feng Cang to finish, Murong Qi Qi roared again.</p><br/><p>Now, an obscure anger was scurrying everywhere in her body. Feng Cang actually let people kidnap her people? Her shops had been destroyed and now, they still didn\u2019t know who the culprit is? All these things were stacked together and the spearheads pointed at Feng Cang, making Murong Qi Qi unable to not get angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was jealous!\u201d Feng Cang also roared. His eyes stared at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face which had become red from anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment I knew you were Du Xian Er, I began to eat vinegar! The whole jianghu said that Du Xian Er and Guanghua gongzi were a pair of immortals. When you and I married, Guanghua gongzi also bet heavily on you, making me unable to not think about the relationship between you two! You\u2019re my wangfei, who does Guanghua gongzi think he is to steal my wangfei? I was jealous. So jealous, I went crazy and wished that I could kill this rival, alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a long speech, Feng Cang yelled it in one take. After the roar, the image he had in the heart of his underlings, immediately collapsed. It turned out to be like this! Because of eating vinegar, master had actually fought with mistress! Master, ah!</p><br/><p>After a silent while, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s tight face suddenly loosened. With a \u2018puchi\u2026\u2019 sound, she laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! You, this fool! You actually ate vinegar because of me!\u201d The woman in red trembled from laughing under the moonlight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

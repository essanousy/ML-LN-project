Murong Qi Q had said when doing things, you need to use your brains, don\u2019t always go fight and kill. So she also learned these.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi threw a milk white jade dragon at Su Mei.</p><br/><p>\u201cLongze Jing Tian still owes me five hundred thousand silver taels. You go get it. Remember, I only want bank biljets!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei touched the jade and looked at Murong Qi Qi. She had heard from her miss about the encounter with Longze Jing Tian in the forest. Going to collect a debt at this time is most appropriate.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, then I\u2019ll go now!\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving the command, Su Mei left xiang fu 2 cheerfully.</p><br/><p>As Su Mei appeared in front of Jing wangfu, 3</p><br/><p>one of the four great families Baifu 4 also received an unfamiliar guest.</p><br/><p>\u201cTong Bao Zhai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong Bao Zhai is the place where they sell jewelry. It is the jewelry store of Guang Hua gongzi</p><br/><p>Looking at the invitation in his hand, Bai Mu Fei was stunned for a moment. They didn\u2019t have any business going on with Tong Bao Zhai. He didn\u2019t know why the shopkeeper of Tong Bao Zhao had come to visit. But in this world, he\u2019s afraid that there\u2019s no one who would refuse Guang Hua gongzi\u2019s 5 Tong Bao Zhai.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who came in was a forty-something middle-aged man. His face was dark of color and he\u2019s slim. When he saw Bai Mu Fei, he came forward and bowed: \u201cBai gongzi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShopkeeper Fang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei politely bowed back. He immediately let someone pour tea. He didn\u2019t dare to show the slightest neglect.</p><br/><p>Fang Kui sat down. The attendant behind him put a sandalwood box on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi, I will not talk in rounds. Today, I came to your fu because our family\u2019s gongzi\u2019s commanded me to give this box of jewelry to miss Bai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei was even more surprised by Fang Kui\u2019s words. Which jewelry from Tong Bao Zhai was not hard to find and couldn\u2019t even be bought with money? Now he\u2019s giving a full box to Bai Yi Yue. What did Guang Hua gongzi mean by this? Could it be that he took a fancy to little sister?</p><br/><p>The way Bai Mu Fei thought seemed to be within Fang Kui\u2019s expectations. He stroked his beard while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai gongzi doesn\u2019t need to think more of it. It\u2019s just that my family\u2019s gongziowes miss Bai a favor. Now, he\u2019s just repaying a debt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRepaying a debt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Bai Mu Fei didn\u2019t understand it even more. When did little sister help Guang Hua gongzi? Why didn\u2019t he know about it? Even though he thought like this, he still let the servant go call Bai Yi Yue.</p><br/><p>Today, Princess Ping Yang Longze Yu Er also happens to visit Bai fu. Since she did not have to go chongxi for demon wang, Longze Yu Er\u2019s mood was very good. As to why she came to Bai fu, it\u2019s because of Bai Mu Fei.</p><br/><p>Ping Yang is her title as princess. Longze Yu Er is her given name</p><br/><p>The family that Duanmu Qing had taken a fancy to as Longze Yu Er\u2019s husband is the Bai family. The Bai family is really rich, they had plenty of money. If Longze Yu Er become Bai family\u2019s first daughter-in-law, in the future if her (DQ) son got the throne and needs money, she don\u2019t need to be afraid that the Bai family would be stingy!</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I think third miss Murong is very pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing Longze Yu Er\u2019s happiness, Bai Yi Yue said her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter all, there are too many rumors about Feng Cang. A girl marrying to another country is not something that an ordinary woman would be able to bear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi Yue, what do you mean, ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Bai Yi Yue take Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side, Longze Yu Er is unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t go, could it be that you want bengong 6 to marry demon wang?Don\u2019t you know the fate of those women who married demon wang? Do you want bengong to die tragically on the wedding night, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue is already accustomed to Longze Yu Er\u2019s craftiness, but she won\u2019t bow down just because the other party is a princess.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, everyone is born from a mother and father. They didn\u2019t pop out of a stone. Now that third miss is going to Bei Zhou in your place, you should be thankful instead. Yue er7 never had those thoughts that princess said and only described the facts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er was so angry that she gritted her teeth in rage. She is a princess, why did Bai Yi Yue whisk her face everytime like this! Seeing Bai Yi Yue\u2019s calm expression, Longze Yu Er felt her anger rise.</p><br/><p>Humph! For now, bengong will let you be. After bengong marries into Bai family and becomes your sister-in-law, you\u2019ll see!</p><br/><p>Just then, the servant Bai Mu Fei had sent broke the heavy atmosphere. After hearing that Tong Bao Zhai had gifted Bai Yi Yue a box of jewelry, Longze Yu Er immediately put the unhappiness in the back of her mind. Instead, she acted like she is the one who had received the gift: \u201cWhere is it, escort bengong?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she entered the main hall and saw the box next to Fang Kui, she immediately commanded him to open the box.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, our gongzi said that this box of jewelry is for miss Bai. Only miss Bai can personally open it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face being torn in public, immediately made Longze Yu Er\u2019s expression turn dark. Fang Kui\u2019s eyes leaped over the princess in front of him and kindly looked at Bai Yi Yue, who had appeared last.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreeting to miss Bai! To express his gratitude to miss\u2019s helping hand, our family\u2019s gongzi specially designed this set of \u2018Begonia\u2019s spring sleep\u2019 and asked this little one to give it to miss as miss\u2019s sixteenth birthday gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Kui opened the box in front of Bai Yi Yue. Immediately, only the sound of breaths being drawn out could be heard. Stars appeared in the eyes of all the women present. Even Bai Mu Fei as a man had no choice but to admire the superb skills and sophisticated design.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er reached out and wanted to touch, but was stopped by Fang Kui.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, this set of jewelry is very precious!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hidden meaning was, you don\u2019t break it.</p><br/><p>This time, Longze Yu Er got angry: \u201cWhat about bengong taking a look at it? What a bad toy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Kui didn\u2019t get angry because of Longze Yu Er\u2019s inappropriate words. Instead, he put the box in Bai Yi Yue\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cBehind every jewelry, there\u2019s miss\u2019s maiden name engraved on them. Our family\u2019s gongzi said Tong Bao Zhai won\u2019t make a second set of this jewelry. Asking miss Bai to be rest assured. In this world, there won\u2019t ever appear the same set of jewelry. If there is, it will surely be an imitation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Born in the richest family, Bai Yi Yue only lived in brocade garments and jade meals.</p><br/><p>Brocade garments and jade meals: a life of luxury.</p><br/><p>What kind of good things had she not seen? But she still was deeply attracted to this set of \u2018Begonia\u2019s spring sleep\u2019 in front of her. Just with one glance, she knew that this was the highest quality of suet jade. Such a big expense, such fine jewelry, was it really for her? Bai Yi Yue couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs such a precious gift really for me? With all respect, Yue er doesn\u2019t remember having ever seen Guang Hua gongzi. Let alone ever helping him. Could it be that Guang Hua gongzi remembered wrongly? If it\u2019s like this, Yueer cannot accept this gift because it\u2019s really too precious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue\u2019s words were very sincere. Seeing her this way, Fang Kui was very pleased. The way miss sees people was really good. This miss Bai is indeed worthy to become friends with!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, be assured, our family\u2019s gongzi didn\u2019t remember wrongly. It\u2019s just that miss has a good heart and inadvertently did something good and didn\u2019t remember it. But to our family\u2019s gongzi, meeting miss by chance and miss speaking out for justice is the most valuable! Please be assured!\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing Bai Yi Yue inadvertently getting Tong Bao Zhai\u2019s full set of jewelry, Longze Yu Er\u2019s eyes almost fell out from envy. No! She is a princess, why does Bai Yi Yue have it and she doesn\u2019t?</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Longze Yu Er stood in front of Fang Kui. She put one hand on her hip and pointed the other hand at him: \u201cHey, go back and say to your family\u2019s whatever gongzi, bengong also wants a set of jewelry and it also needs to be unique! Let him make it quickly for bengong! By that time,bengong will reward him heavily!\u201d</p><br/><p>Footnotes:</p><br/><p>1. Yuan: wing/part of a residence?</p><br/><p>2.

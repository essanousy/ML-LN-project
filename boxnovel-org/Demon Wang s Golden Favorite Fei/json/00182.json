Wanyan Ming Yue, Su Mei and Su Yue entered Tingsong building.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to Qi Qi! It\u2019s hard on women when they give birth. However, the child was so well-behaved before. This time, he also wouldn\u2019t let it be hard on his mother!\u201d Dongfang Lan saw that Feng Cang was anxious. She comforted Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Cousin brother, heavens will help the worthy! It would be fine! Don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang had just finished speaking when he found that everyone was glaring murderously at him, \u2018scaring\u2019 him that he almost became mute. \u201cIt has nothing to do with me. It really has nothing to do with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The only person on the scene who was excited was Wanyan Jie. \u201cGreat-grandmother, the moment I spoke, little brother was born. Is my mouth not like gold and my words like jade?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mouth like gold, words like jade: what one says will come true, usually used by the emperor.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Jie\u2019s innocent words helped Wanyan Kang get out of trouble and also let the atmosphere become a bit more relaxed.</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Feng Qi Qi laid on the big bed. The hair on her forehead was already wet and sticking to her head. Now, it was just the contraction phase. The pain spread from the lower part of her body. Feng Qi Qi clenched her teeth and didn\u2019t let herself scream. Seeing her daughter like this, Wanyan Ming Yue turned her face to a side and wiped away her tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoowoo, give me something to eat!\u201d After a burst of pain passed, Feng Qi Qi let Su Mei bring out the already steamed egg and fed her. Feng Qi Qi knew that this was only the beginning. The real time-consuming and energy-consuming pain was yet to come.</p><br/><p>Time slowly passed by. The hearts of everyone waiting outside were in their throats. Feng Cang\u2019s expression was grave like never before. From the moment Feng Qi Qi went into the room until now, his lips had been in a straight line. He hadn\u2019t said a word. How scary that appearance could be was how scary that appearance was. It was as if the one giving birth wasn\u2019t Feng Qi Qi but him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that you all don\u2019t have to be so tense. Cousin in law is hurting inside. If all of us are nervous, wouldn\u2019t we be putting more pressure on her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Wanyan Kang\u2019s argument was somewhat far-fetched, but as long it was good to Feng Qi Qi, Feng Cang would try. After hearing him (WK) say this, Feng Cang relaxed a bit. He didn\u2019t stand anymore but sat on a chair. However, the coldness emitting from his body didn\u2019t decrease for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, Ming Yue Cheng, it\u2019s the new year. Why did you run to our Bei Zhou? What about your country?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang wanted to let the atmosphere relax a bit, so he looked for a topic of discussion. It just so happened that Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s state wasn\u2019t much better than Feng Cang\u2019s. He kept frowning and staring at Tingsong building. That gaze was like it wanted to burn a hole into the window.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ming Yue Cheng didn\u2019t answer, Wanyan Kang was a bit embarrassed. Instead, it was Gu Yun Wan who answered Wanyan Kang\u2019s question. \u201cHe, ah, threw everything to my father! It\u2019s like my family owns him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Only now did Wanyan Kang discover that there was one more beauty around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Gu Yun Wan!\u201d Gu Yun Wan introduced herself. Wanyan Kang was surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re Nan Feng\u2019s empress dowager? Then, aren\u2019t you Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s empress mother? Heavens, you\u2019re the youngest and most beautiful empress dowager I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s words amused Gu Yun Wan. \u201cYou\u2019re also very funny!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Wanyan Kang cupped his hands and was about to say more when Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s murderous eyes glared at him, making Wanyan Kang shudder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, alright, I won\u2019t speak anymore! I will shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang knew that everyone blamed him for what had happened to Feng Qi Qi at the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner. This made Wanyan Kang feel very wronged. However, when he thought about what Ming Yue Cheng said, that this little nephew or niece had fate with him, Wanyan Kang\u2019s mood became a lot better.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, if it\u2019s painful, shout it out!\u201d Inside the room, Wanyan Ming Yue carefully wiped the sweat from Feng Qi Qi\u2019s forehead with a warm towel. \u201cOr, should I bring something to let you bite on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a towel to bite on!\u201d Feng Qi Qi took deep breaths. Her hands tightly clutched the satin hanging from the top. She had long heard that giving birth was very painful, but she didn\u2019t expect that this kind of pain was unimaginable to ordinary people. It seemed that the saying giving birth to a life, the mother would cross, indeed made some sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, here!\u201d Su Yue brought a clean towel and handed it to Feng Qi Qi. Feng Qi Qi bit on the towel. She felt a lot better.</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Qi Qi like this, Wanyan Ming Yue knew that she was afraid that if she screamed, it would let the people who were waiting, especially Feng Cang, feel heartache. So, she preferred to bite down on the towel and not make a sound.</p><br/><p>Foolish child\u2026Wanyan Ming Yue didn\u2019t say it out loud. She could only silently wipe away the sweat of her daughter and do everything in her power.</p><br/><p>The midwife was ready. Hot water, clean towels, everything was ready. Everyone was waiting for that crucial moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there any noise?\u201d Outside the room, Feng Xie walked back and forth. From time to time, he would look at the room. When Wanyan Ming Yue gave birth to Feng Qi Qi, he wasn\u2019t able to be there. Now, he could finally be there when his daughter gave birth to his grandson, but the room was so quiet that it felt out of the ordinary! Could it be that it wasn\u2019t painful?</p><br/><p>After Feng Xie said that, the others also noticed something strange. Su Mei came out at the right time. Wanyan Kang immediately stopped her. \u201cLittle Mei er,1 why didn\u2019t anything happen yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei felt heartache for Feng Qi Qi. After she saw Wanyan Kang and thought about how he\u2019d incited little emperor to say that sentence, Su Mei\u2019s expression immediately sank. \u201cWhat do you think women giving birth is, ah?! Miss is biting the towel! What kind of sound do you want miss to make?\u201d</p><br/><p>After dropping these hard sentences, Su Mei left without turning back. Wanyan Kang stood there, feeling a bit embarrassed. It was not right to laugh nor cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s worried about Feng Qi Qi and isn\u2019t intentionally targeting you! Don\u2019t put it in your heart!\u201d Gu Yun Wan comforted Wanyan Kang after seeing him like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was saying this, but Wanyan Kang wished he could slap himself two times. Su Mei said that Feng Qi Qi was biting on a towel. It was definitely very painful, but she didn\u2019t want people to be worried. That\u2019s why she was like that. After getting everyone\u2019s \u2018blame\u2019, Wanyan Kang actively took up the reputation of \u2018villain\u2019. He squatted at a side and didn\u2019t speak anymore.</p><br/><p>After Feng Cang heard that Feng Qi Qi was biting on a towel, his fingers went into his palm. She was definitely hurting very much now! It was all his fault for letting her get pregnant. Now, she was enduring a torture inside, and he couldn\u2019t be of any help. He\u2019s really useless!</p><br/><p>Naturally, Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t know Feng Cang\u2019s thought. Now, she was being tortured by the pain. Giving birth to a child was really no ordinary hardship!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangfei,2 four fingers are open. Continue on!\u201d At this time, the four midwives were also very nervous. Although they were the most experienced palace maids, but at this time, they were also so anxious that they sweated.</p><br/><p>The one lying here was one of the most noble women of Bei Zhou. Now, the emperor and the grand empress dowager were waiting outside. The regent was also waiting outside. If something happened to Feng Qi Qi\u2026then, wouldn\u2019t it be as simple as their heads landing on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ah! Wangfei, little shizi3 is about to come out! Have a bit more strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but, mother\u2026I feel so painful!\u201d The towel in Feng Qi Qi\u2019s mouth fell. She finally shouted, \u201cPain\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother is here. Qi Qi, don\u2019t be afraid. Mother will stay here with you!\u201d Wanyan Ming Yue held Feng Qi Qi\u2019s hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re hurting, hold onto mother\u2019s hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Feng Qi Qi withdrew her hand and continued to hold on the white satin cloth. She knew how great her strength is. What if she broke Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hand?</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Feng Qi Qi felt that she had passed through a century. Outside the room, the night was replaced by the day. Today was the first day of the year. It was a sunny day and the weather was good.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan took Wanyan Jie to rest for a while. Early in the morning, Wanyan Jie woke up. After washing up and having breakfast, he immediately grabbed Dongfang Lan and came to Tingsong building.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother still hasn\u2019t come out? Is it that he doesn\u2019t like me? Doesn\u2019t like to play with me?\u201d When he heard that Feng Qi Qi\u2019s child wasn\u2019t born yet, Wanyan Jie pouted and felt a bit sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, little brother is also doing his best. Your little aunty is also doing her best!\u201d Dongfang Lan gently touched Wanyan Jie\u2019s head. \u201cWait a bit. Perhaps little brother would come out soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d Only after listening to great-grandmother\u2019s words did Wanyan Jie reveal an innocent smile. From dawn till now, it had already been more than eight hours. Feng Cang felt that his patience is disappearing little by little. Although he didn\u2019t hear Feng Qi Qi\u2019s screams, but Feng Cang knew that she must\u2019ve been very uncomfortable these eight hours.</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhiya\u2026\u2019 The door opened. The maid came out with a brass pan that was covered with a towel. Inside it was used water and it smelled of blood. She was afraid that people would see it, so they covered it with a towel.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s wangfei? How\u2019s it inside the room?\u201d Feng Cang stopped the maid and questioned her.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know if she was scared by Feng Cang\u2019s aura, this little girl stuttered a long time and only when Feng Cang screamed, \u201cTalk!\u201d, did she open her mouth, \u201cWangfei is petite, so it is more difficult to give birth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Boom\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s palm hit the pillar. He\u2019d actually hit the pillar that was thick as a child and let it become a few pieces of stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye,4 spare me!\u201d This maid was only fourteen or fifteen years old. Now, after seeing Feng Cang flip out, her legs went soft and her hands lost strength. The brass pan fell on the ground and the bloody water spilled all over.</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang saw that red bloody water, his expression became worse. When the maid saw that stirred up trouble, she immediately knelt on the ground and kowtowed. \u201cWangye, spare me! This slave didn\u2019t do it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, go on with what you were doing!\u201d When Dongfang Lan saw this, she stepped forward to help the maid. \u201cGo, they\u2019re still waiting for your help inside the room!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking grand empress dowager! Thanking grand empress dowager!\u201d The maid picked up the brass pan and quickly entered Tingsong building. Dongfang Lan comforted Feng Cang. \u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous. Qi Qi would have a lot of pressure with you being like this! Relax a bit. Nothing will happen to Qi Qi!\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, after Dongfang Lan heard the maid\u2019s words, she was also very nervous. Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t have a big physique and a narrow pelvis. If the fetus was too large, presumably she would suffer some pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s body went cold and there was sweat on his palms. He had never been so helpless! Although he had been tortured by illness in the past, he hadn\u2019t been scared as he was now. The bloody water had condensed on the ground. The red color irritated Feng Cang\u2019s eyes and heart. He could not imagine how Feng Qi Qi would be after bleeding so much.</p><br/><p>Inside Tingsong building, Feng Qi Qi had long heard that loud sound. After she got to know from Su Mei that Feng Cang was angry, Feng Qi Qi let Wanyan Ming Yue ask Feng Cang to come in.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, when a woman gives birth, man cannot enter the delivery room!\u201d After all, Wanyan Ming Yue was a traditional woman. She somewhat couldn\u2019t accept Feng Qi Qi\u2019s request for Feng Cang to stay with her during the labor.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I really can\u2019t hold it anymore\u2026\u201d Feng Qi Qi\u2019s originally bright red lips had turned pale. She looked pitifully at Wanyan Ming Yue and used the cuteness of a little girl to beg her.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, if the time is prolonged, it wouldn\u2019t be good for neither the adult nor the child! Princess\u2019s pelvis is really too narrow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The midwives were also at their wit\u2019s end. They were tormented the whole night. Now, the sky had already become bright, but there was still no indication that the child was about to come out. They were also afraid; afraid that they would be responsible for a human life. Traditionally, it was indeed said that men couldn\u2019t enter the delivery room. However, Feng Qi Qi couldn\u2019t give birth. If wangye is at her side, it would give her strength.</p><br/><p>Hearing the midwife say this, Wanyan Ming Yue also panicked. \u201cQuickly, quickly go ask wangye to come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue hurriedly went out. After paying her respect to Dongfang Lan, Su Yue turned to Feng Cang. \u201cGuye,5 miss wants to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s heart sank. From Su Yue\u2019s tone it was like Feng Qi Qi wanted to make her \u2018dying words\u2019 clear. Not waiting for Su Yue to finish, Feng Cang rushed into Tingsong building like a gust of wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan could only say one word. Her outstretched hand stopped there. Forget it. At this time, why care about that so much?! The most important thing was to keep the mother and child safe and sound!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I came!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang wanted to approach Feng Qi Qi but was stopped by Su Mei. \u201cGuye, go wash first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang quickly washed his face with warm water before he came to Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d After seeing Feng Qi Qi\u2019s wet clothes because of the sweat, Feng Cang felt a deep pain in his heart. When he saw Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s tired look, Feng Cang quickly replaced Wanyan Ming Yue to let her rest at a side.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, we lost for sure this time!\u201d When Feng Qi Qi saw Feng Cang, the discomfort in her heart disappeared.</p><br/><p>She let go of the white satin cloth in her hands and clutched Feng Cang\u2019s hand tightly. \u201cWhat to do? This child is so naughty; it\u2019s definitely a boy! We, we bet on a girl. This time, we definitely lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Er: term of endearment </p><br/><p>2.

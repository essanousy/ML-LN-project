It\u2019s already been ten years since he came to Xi Qi as a hostage,\u201d whispered Shangguan Wu Ji to Murong Qi Qi after Ming Yue Cheng came on board.</p><br/><p>Hostage? Crown prince? Is that not a prisoner\u2026 \u2026 Murong Qi Qi stared thoughtfully at Ming Yue Cheng.</p><br/><p>A pair of wooden clogs, barefoot. Simple purple clothes, casually bound together with a knot, revealing a bronzed chest. A wine gourd is hanging at his waist. A silver purple ribbon simply tied his black hair together. A pair of unruly eyes floated across the crowd. When they looked at Murong Qi Qi, he nodded slightly at her in greeting. Then his eyes rested on Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to wangye1!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng greeted and didn\u2019t care so much about etiquette. He sat directly on the floor and took the jug of wine at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood wine\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Longze Jing Tian to open his mouth, Ming Yue Cheng raised his head and poured the good wine into his mouth.</p><br/><p>This man is interesting! Murong Qi Qi thought in her heart.</p><br/><p>Looks like this is an era of young, handsome men. Every man on this boat, which one is not a fine specimen? Longze Jing Tian is noble, Shangguan Wu Ji is heroic, Li Yun Qing is elegant, Bai Mu Fei is handsome and this crown prince Ming Yue Cheng, who is in dire straits, also has another air.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know how that husband of hers, whom she had never met, looks like. The rumors say that Nan Lin wang is Bei Zhou\u2019s most handsome man. There are also people who say he is the number first beauty of the world. Don\u2019t know if these rumors are true or false\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Those girls didn\u2019t seem to put Ming Yue Cheng into their eyes. After all, one\u2019s not an optimistic hostage, even if it\u2019s a crown prince, so what? It\u2019s still a question whether he can or cannot return to Nan Feng. Let alone talking about a future!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, this is good wine, can you gift it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng drank enough of the wine but didn\u2019t seem to be satisfied. He looked somewhat cravingly at the jug of wine in front of Longze Jing Tian. It\u2019s like a cat seeing a fish.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy treasure hasn\u2019t encountered such good wine in a long time!\u201d (TN: his treasure is probably his jug)</p><br/><p>While talking, Ming Yue Cheng took down the jug at his waist as if it was the world\u2019s most precious thing. It attracted Longze Yu Er\u2019s ridicule.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial brother, since he is so greedy, why don\u2019t you reward it to him lest people say we are bullying a hostage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s contempt attracted the girls\u2019 laughter. Only Bai Yi Yue is sitting quietly as if it\u2019s not a matter of concern.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng acted like he didn\u2019t hear the ridicule in Longze Yu Er\u2019s words and continued to stare at the jug with hungry eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party\u2019s expression seemed to make Longze Jing Tian happy. He waved his hands and let people bring a jar of wine in front of Ming Yue Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you wangye! Thank you wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Chen excitedly said thanks two times. A moment later, he acted like he couldn\u2019t believe that Longze Jing Tian would be so generous and asked: \u201cAre you really giving them to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>That cautious look made Longze Jing Tian laugh: \u201cI said to reward them to you, then they are yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks! Thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng impatiently filled his jug with wine. Then he carefully closed the jars.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I\u2019ll drink it slowly when I go back! Such a good wine needs to be carefully savored!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, you can leave first!\u201d</p><br/><p>After teasing Ming Yue Cheng, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart, which had been affected by Murong Qi Qi, seemed a lot better.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng carefully handed a jar of wine over to Fu Er and took the other half-filled jar of wine into his embrace. Another hand held the ladder as he left the boat. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s done on purpose or it\u2019s just an accident but the boat suddenly shook two times. Ming Yue Cheng hadn\u2019t held onto the ladder well and went straight into the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Er anxiously extended a paddle to lift Ming Yue Cheng up, but he didn\u2019t expect that Ming Yue Cheng would firstly put the half-filled jar of wine onto the boat.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wine! Don\u2019t let my wine become spoiled!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPu chi\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ming Yue Cheng being so useless, Murong Qing Lian laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really never saw such a crown prince. He doesn\u2019t even deserve to clean wangye\u2019s shoes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian\u2019s words received everyone\u2019s approval. In their eyes, this crown prince of Nan Feng country was just a loser.</p><br/><p>However, was he really a loser? Murong Qi Qi looked thoughtfully at Ming Yue Chen, whose whole body had become wet and after climbing onto the boat, was still giggling at the crowd. This person was really interesting\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThird little sister, drink some green bean soup. It\u2019s refreshing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the farce, Murong Xin Lian smilingly came up, holding a bowl of green bean soup.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrink, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just from smelling it, Murong Qi Qi knew that something had been added to this green bean soup. But this time, she\u2019s too lazy to play with Murong Xin Lian. She directly put her hand up to refuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to drink second big sister green bean soup. In the past, I drank second big sister\u2019s wine and almost did something wrong. Today, if I really drink this green bean soup, maybe I will fall into the lake and won\u2019t even know how I will die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi being so direct made Murong Xin Lian\u2019s face turn from blue to red and then back to blue. She didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi would not give her face and directly say that out loud.</p><br/><p>Looking once again, Longze Jing Tian seemed to have heard Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words. He looked at her while frowning, making Murong Xin Lian\u2019s heart feel even more hatred. But on her face, she couldn\u2019t not put a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird little sister, you really love to joke around!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister, everyone knows how our relationship is. There\u2019s no need to act so artificial. All these years, I accompanied you to act. I\u2019m tired of acting. Now second big sister you got your wish, little sister also has a place to go to. Today, I saw how harmonious second big sister and brother-in-law are living with each other, I can now be at ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi walked to the center of the boat and bowed at everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi thanks everyone for your care. If in the past there were some unpleasantness, please forgive me. In the future, the mountains are high and the water is long, we won\u2019t have a chance to see each other again. Today, I will borrow brother-in-law wangye\u2019s name and will see this as a farewell banquet for me. This cup of wine is me making amends to everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi drank the cup of wine and showed everyone the empty cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yue, let\u2019s leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as everyone\u2019s wondering why Murong Qi Qi was saying that, a small boat pulled over. The one on the boat is Feng Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, it\u2019s the time for learning. Asking princess to go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeeds to trouble aunty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi and Feng Yu are talking in Bei Zhou\u2019s language. Longze Jing Tian is really surprised. Just in a few days, Murong Qi Qi can already speak Bei Zhou\u2019s language so well. Is this young maiden really the rubbish that everyone talks about?</p><br/><p>This question already had no way of being answered. Murong Qi Qi had gotten on the small boat.</p><br/><p>Seeing the small boat move further away, Longze Jing Tian once again heard the cries deep in his heart. Keep her, otherwise, you will regret it! This voice came unexpectedly. Even Longze Jing Tian couldn\u2019t control it. When he came out of the daze, the beauty was already far away.</p><br/><p>When the boat reached the shore, Murong Qi Qi handed a letter to Su Yue to let her give it to Ming Yue Cheng.</p><br/><p>At the other end, Ming Yue Cheng also reached the shore. Seeing the letter Su Yue had sent, Ming Yue Cheng was somewhat puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur family miss said that your highness is no ordinary person. She hopes that your highness wakes up soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue left Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s vision smilingly.</p><br/><p>1. Wangye/ wang: prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

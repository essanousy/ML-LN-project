Although Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s task was to safely escort her to Bei Zhou to marry, but because the marriage had been blocked by the empress dowager, his mission had not been completed yet, so he could only wait at the house of the embassy.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Wu Ji repeatedly came to Nan Lin wangfu1 to see Murong Qi Qi, but every time, he was stopped by housekeeper Feng Qi. He always used the excuse \u2018my family\u2019s wangye2 is nurturing feelings with wangfei3\u2019, literally making that handsome face of Shangguan Wu Ji so red that it could drop blood.</p><br/><p>Of course, such cheesy words were also instructed by Feng Cang. His purpose was to let Shangguan Wu Ji give up. Murong Qi Qi was his, how could he let other people covet her?!</p><br/><p>However, it looked like that this young general was somewhat stubborn. He still came every day to wangfu to \u2018pay his respect to princess\u2019. Even when he got the cold shoulder and also heard a lot of stories about how good the relationship between Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi is, but he still insisted on seeing Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was not afraid of stubbornness!</p><br/><p>Now, he saw Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s earnestness as a war between them. He was a young god of war. Now that the world was at peace, he had nothing to do, but defending was also his expertise. Guard Murong Qi Qi inside this capital; swat all the other people who want to covet her was the most important thing right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye saying it like that is not right! I\u2019m a particularly unusual person. I like mature men! \u2018Old men\u2019 are chewy with toughness and also can exercise one\u2019s teeth! Getting three birds with one stone. How can the young I not like \u2018old men\u2019?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi saying it so seriously amused Feng Cang. He laughed out loud. He took Murong Qi Qi into his arms. His chin gently dawdled on her forehead. This little woman, ever since she had opened her heart, her personality became livelier.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I also like to eat such fresh and tender grass like you. It\u2019s a good taste for the mouth. There\u2019s enough moisture. Besides, my teeth is not good. There\u2019s no need to chew tender grass, only need to swallow it\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, wangye and I are a perfect match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cheeks were red, but the words coming from her mouth were a lot bolder.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Could it be that you\u2019ve forgotten that you came to this world with only the mission to become my wangfei?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang saying that made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face go completely red. Originally, she wanted to compete with Feng Cang to see whose face was \u2018thicker\u2019. She didn\u2019t expect that after the numerous confrontations of the past few days, ultimately, she would be defeated by Feng Cang. She really was not able to say words that were more cheesy than that\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>These two flirted like there was no one around them, making Ru Yi and Su Yue who were also in the room get red faces. While serving their masters, their ears feverishly listened to their flirtation.</p><br/><p>Such scenes happened for five days already. Although they didn\u2019t know what happened that day at the banquet, but everyone could feel that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s relationship had reached a new level. The two often had some intimate action or said some love words which were able to sweeten people to death, making they, the servants, feel very embarrassed.</p><br/><p>However, regardless of Su Yue and the others\u2019 embarrassment, but this pair have become addicted to sweetness. Everywhere in wangfu, Feng Cang\u2019s laughter could be heard. This was the first time it ever happened in these past ten years, which made the servants of the fu4, when they had nothing to do, gather outside of Tingsong Building to watch. They wanted to know what ability this new wangfei had to make wangye so happy.</p><br/><p>For a time, the outside of Tingsong Building became the liveliest place of Nan Lin wangfu. Everyone wanted to see this new wangfei\u2019s elegant bearing.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Feng Cang, this wangye\u2019s possessiveness was too strong. He never allowed Murong Qi Qi to leave his side for even half a step. Even when going out, he would put a veil on her. So, this princess from Xi Qi became a mystery. And talk about this mysterious princess was spread to the outsiders by the people of wangfu. She also became the hottest topic of recent discussion in the capital.</p><br/><p>Since the welcoming banquet, the empress dowager didn\u2019t continue to make things difficult for Murong Qi Qi. However, didn\u2019t know who spread the word about the bet; now all the streets of the capital were rumoring about this matter. There were even gambling dens which opened bets; betting if Bei Zhou can or cannot win, betting on if Murong Qi Qi can successfully become the new wangfei.</p><br/><p>From the moment Bei Zhou was founded till now, Bei Zhou hadn\u2019t win for four consecutive tournaments. Not to mention the last time; Bei Zhou came last among the four countries. Could this time, because of a princess who came to form a marriage alliance, be a turning point? Can that even happen?</p><br/><p>In many people\u2019s hearts, the answer to this question was negative. No matter how mysterious Murong Qi Qi was, it didn\u2019t change the fact that she was a \u2018rubbish\u2019. Regardless of how outstanding Feng Cang, this Nan Lin wang was, it also couldn\u2019t change the fact that his eight wives had all died.</p><br/><p>Similarly, no matter how strong Bei Zhou was, it also couldn\u2019t change the fact that this country didn\u2019t have any top experts. Although this was a contest between young people, but from the ability of the young people, the new strength of a country could be seen. This was a fact everyone understood. Almost everyone put their bet on the side of that Murong Qi Qi would lose, on the side that Bei Zhou would lose.</p><br/><p>Although the citizens loved their country, and they all wished for Bei Zhou to get the first place, but the truth was put in front of them. Besides, this matter was related to the silver in their purse. So, in the end they chose their most truthful thought.</p><br/><p>However, there were always exceptions. When Guanghua gongzi5 bet five million silver teals that Bei Zhou would certainly win, all of Bei Zhou was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>Guanghua gongzi? What kind of character was he? In this vast land, as long as there\u2019s women, there would be people who knew about Guanghua gongzi. If the times were more open and women could have fantasies, Guanghua gongzi would definitely be the first fantasy of women.</p><br/><p>Never was there a man who understood the needs and desire for beauty of a woman and could express it through jewelry and clothing. The women of this world, no matter if they were noble or humble, no matter if they were beautiful or ugly, as long as they were a woman, they would have a heart which loved beauty. And Guanghua gongzi fulfilled their wish.</p><br/><p>For women, even if they couldn\u2019t afford those expensive jewelry and clothing, but as long as they could take a glance, even if the next moment they die, they would be willing.</p><br/><p>Now Guanghua gongzi was actually betting that Murong Qi Qi would win, making everyone\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but gather at Nan Lin wangfu.</p><br/><p>No one had ever seen Guanghua gongzi, that\u2019s why people rumored him to be so marvelous. There were some who say he\u2019s a prince of a country. Others say that he was a young master of a great family. There were also some who say he\u2019s the descendant of a mysterious clan. In short, a variety of bizarre identities had been put on him.</p><br/><p>And such a mysterious Guanghua gongzi had placed a bet of five million on Murong Qi Qi. There seemed to be an ulterior motive behind it.</p><br/><p>While everyone was thinking about how Nan Lin wang Feng Cang would guess Murong Qi Qi and Guanghua gongzi\u2019s relationship, how Nan Lin wangfu would now be in a mess, another mysterious person placed a ten million bet on Bei Zhou winning the tournament.</p><br/><p>This time, Guanghua gongzi was defeated. The other party didn\u2019t leave any trace of information, which resulted in a variety of speculation. There were even people who suspected that this person was the emperor of Bei Zhou Wanyan Lie. The emperor saw that his own citizens were betting that Bei Zhou would lose, his heart was uncomfortable and he also lost face. So, he bet ten million to buy back a face.</p><br/><p>However, all speculations were fleeting. The rumors intensified, but the truth was known to no one. The famous person from the rumors, Murong Qi Qi, with the help of Guanghua gongzi and the mysterious person, in one shot became the person Bei Zhou paid most attention to. These happenings didn\u2019t affect Murong Qi Qi\u2019s daily life, but it let some other women hate till their face became distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard! Bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu kicked the stool. Angry, she smashed all the porcelain onto the ground. Originally, she wanted to see Murong Qi Qi become a joke, she didn\u2019t expect that two men would appear, disturbing her mood of watching a play.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t be angry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yong er6 quickly caught the porcelain vase from Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s hand and let people put it to one side. She helped Wanyan Bao Zhu sit down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t anger your body because of a slut. You are too noble, ah! If your body gets sick because of anger, it\u2019s you who will feel pain and the enemy will feel happiness. Besides, it\u2019s almost time for the tournament. Didn\u2019t you also want to show yourself at the tournament?! You can\u2019t get sick, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong7 is not satisfied!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu bit her lips. Two tears rolled from her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, go call Chou er over. Didn\u2019t she say that she has a way to deal with Murong Qi Qi? Call her over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yong er brought Chou er over. She was a woman who wore a veil that only revealed her eyes. Even though only her eyes could be seen, but that pair of eyes was so beautiful that it could touch people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis slave Chou er greets princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can get up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu gestured with her hand to let other people retreat. She only let Yong er and Chou er stay.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day when bengong saved you, you said you were Xi Qi\u2019s citizen, is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. This slave is Xi Qi\u2019s citizen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Xi Qi\u2019s citizen. Then tell bengong the origin of your relationship with Murong Qi Qi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Murong Qi Qi was mentioned, in Chou er\u2019s eyes were hatred and also ice-cold intention to murder. Even Yong er at one side felt afraid. Chou er spent an hour talking about her and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s relationship. Hearing Chou er\u2019s words, Wanyan Bao Zhu looked at her thoughtfully. She believed some parts, but didn\u2019t believe the whole story.</p><br/><p>\u201cChou er, since you say that Murong Qi Qi is jealous of your beauty and ruined your face, then drop your veil. Let bengong take a look at your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s words made Chou er shiver a bit. She took a deep breath and slowly untied the veil on her face.</p><br/><p>Just one look, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t help but breathe deeply. What kind of hideous face was that, ah?! It\u2019s covered with small, large, round and flat scars. It\u2019s like someone cooked beans and laid it out on Chou er\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>And because the injury on her left face was too deep, the wound was infected. Because there wasn\u2019t any timely treatment, it had began to rot and on it grew new skin. Red scars against the white skin and those withered yellow scars ruined a pretty face completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did she give you those scars?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu covered her mouth and her brow frowned. She gestured for Chou er to put the veil back on.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpraying with hot oil.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just four simple words was able to let people see the cruel situation at that time.</p><br/><p>So, Murong Qi Qi did all of these! Wanyan Bao Zhu was shocked. She didn\u2019t expect that the woman who looked so weak would have such vicious means. Just because the man she liked looked once at this Chou er; just because Chou er was more beautiful than her, she did such a cruel thing! How could such vicious woman stay at Cang gege\u2019s8 side!</p><br/><p>Just thinking about her Ning er dying because of Murong Qi Qi made Wanyan Bao Zhu become furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cChou er, come with bengong! Bengong will take you to Nan Lin wangfu and let you confront Murong Qi Qi in person. Bengong will let you have justice and also let Nan Lin wang see how ugly Murong Qi Qi is, let him see her true face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu slammed the table, stood up and immediately wanted to go, but Chou er clung onto her legs and begged, \u201cPrincess, this slave knows that you are doing it for this slave. This slave is very grateful towards you, but if you go now like this, not only will you bring calamity to this slave, but also bring calamity to yourself, ah! Now Murong Qi Qi has Nan Lin wang\u2019s love. Even if you say it, Nan Lin wang may not let it enter his ears, let alone such a humble and small person like this slave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er\u2019s words made sense, making Wanyan Bao Zhu stop in her tracks. Just in a moment, she thought of another way.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that doesn\u2019t work, then bengong will go with you to the censor! We\u2019ll go find emperor father! He will certainly get justice for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s words let Chou er laughed once bitterly. She continued to kowtow: \u201cPrincess is kind, believes in this slave\u2019s words and is willing to get justice for this slave. However, Murong Qi Qi is Xi Qi\u2019s princess who came to form a marriage alliance. Her status is noble. Even if she kills one or two slaves, it\u2019s just normal. Although emperor is wise, but Nan Lin wang is emperor\u2019s nephew and loves him dearly. So naturally, he (WL) will love everything about and around him (FC). How will he, because of a slave from Xi Qi, go investigate Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wrongdoing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just a trifle matter. It won\u2019t be able to take Murong Qi Qi down in one shot. Instead, it\u2019ll implicate princess and harm the relation between you and Nan Lin wang. Such a thing naturally cannot happen. Asking princess to reconsider!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er was crying, full of grief. Her words also pointed out the crucial factors, making Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t help but stop in her tracks once again and think about what she had said.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the whole capital knew about the love Feng Cang had for Murong Qi Qi. At this time, it\u2019s unlikely that Feng Cang would abandon Murong Qi Qi because of a slave. If she can\u2019t take Murong Qi Qi down in one stroke, and get bitten instead by her (MQQ), then wouldn\u2019t her image in Cang gege\u2019s heart be completely destroyed?!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that not being able to do anything, her heart felt like something was blocking it.</p><br/><p>Obviously, she knew that woman (MQQ) had a poisonous heart, incomparably vicious, but she wasn\u2019t able to say anything and also couldn\u2019t do anything. She would have to see her in Feng Cang\u2019s arms and later become Feng Cang\u2019s bride. How could Wanyan Bao Zhu accept this?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do this, can\u2019t do that. Then you say, what should bengong do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er once again bowed in front of Wanyan Bao Zhu. Her mottled forehead knocked hard on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf princess really cares about this slave, asking princess to let this slave serve at princess\u2019s side! As the saying goes, not bearing the small matter will ruin the big matter. Murong Qi Qi acts very well. If you don\u2019t have any evidence, you can\u2019t do anything to her. Since it\u2019s like this, we can only wait for the right time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this slave doesn\u2019t have any ability, but the hatred towards Murong Qi Qi is the same as princess\u2019s. This slave only asks to stay at princess\u2019s side, work like a horse and an ox, serve princess and wait for the right opportunity! This slave\u2019s hatred towards Murong Qi Qi will let us unable to live under the same sky. One day, this slave will step on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s head and let her regret for her past!\u201d</p><br/><p>Work like a horse and an ox: work extremely hard.</p><br/><p>Looking at Chou er\u2019s expression, Wanyan Bao Zhu pondered for a while. Eventually, she nodded: \u201cAlright! It so happens that bengong\u2019s side needs a personal maid. You can take that place. However, didn\u2019t you say before that you have a way to deal with Murong Qi Qi? How come now it became \u2018wait for the right time\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>To be able to stay, Chou er let out a breath of relief in her head. To Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s question, Chou er quickly and cautiously answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering princess, soon it\u2019ll be the tournament between the four countries. This slave heard that the empress dowager is very dissatisfied with Murong Qi Qi. Because of Nan Lin wang\u2019s resolution, she was forced to make a bet with Murong Qi Qi. The bet is the first place of the tournament of the four countries. Therefore, this tournament of the four countries is our opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as we obstruct in secret, don\u2019t let Bei Zhou win, then Murong Qi Qi won\u2019t be able to become Nan Lin wangfei. A princess to form a marriage alliance, but the marriage alliance is unsuccessful, it\u2019s like a slap in her face, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she talked excitedly, inside Chou er\u2019s eyes flashed a strange light, making Wanyan Bao Zhu startle for a moment. Her face was already ruined like this, but her eyes were still so beautiful. Although it was currently being blinded by hatred and contaminated turbid, but the original beauty of that pair of eyes didn\u2019t lessen much. It seemed that in the past, this person was certainly a beauty! Now, Wanyan Bao Zhu believed Chou er a bit more.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Chou er talking with so much excitement, Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s mood also became better as if she was already able to see the tragic appearance of Murong Qi Qi as she was driven out of the palace. She couldn\u2019t help but want to see what would happen next.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, her title of princess was just bestowed. Now that her marriage is being cancelled by Bei Zhou\u2019s imperial family, because of face, Xi Qi won\u2019t accept her back. By then, she doesn\u2019t have the back of Xi Qi and also doesn\u2019t have the identity of princess, Murong Qi Qi is just a trivial woman. By then, wouldn\u2019t princess be able to dispose of her any way you want?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er\u2019s voice seemed to have magic in it, making Wanyan Bao Zhu be in a very good mood. Just now, her face was like dark clouds, now even a thousand of miles away, it\u2019s a clear sky as if the day Murong Qi Qi would fall was just around the corner and the position of Nan Lin wangfei was now hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cChou er, what you said is very right! How come at bengong\u2019s side, there\u2019s no one as clever as you?! Say, when bengong catch Murong Qi Qi, how should bengong torment her? Cut her head or pull out her tongue? That\u2019s right, bengong will first pull out her tongue, then ruin her face. When she is begging pitifully, then cut her throat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Wanyan Bao Zhu talks, the more excited she got. She even took out a dagger and gestured at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, to a woman, destroying her reputation will let living be more painful than death. There are so many beggars in Yanjing capital. Why don\u2019t you find some who didn\u2019t get to taste meat for quite a while and reward Murong Qi Qi to them? Let them get the taste of a princess who came to form a marriage alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meat doesn\u2019t mean meat here. It means women.</p><br/><p>Chou er\u2019s recommendation made Wanyan Bao Zhu widen her eyes. Completely in disbelief, she asked: \u201cIt can also be done like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er revealed a shiny smile, but inside her head appeared the scene in the dungeon. The way that man breathed, those straws contaminated with red blood, that candle-dim lit night; she wouldn\u2019t forget such humiliation for life. She vowed, she must get revenge. She must let Murong Qi Qi feel that living was more painful than death!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, princess what you need to do now is plan how to do the first step well. This time, Nan Lin wang is the leader of Bei Zhou. For the woman he loves, he will surely do his best to get the first place. How to do, how to destroy is what you need to pay attention to the most. Although Nan Lin wang is not a participant, but this slave has heard that the subordinates of Nan Lin wang are very capable\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you can rest assured about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu raised her head and revealed a mocking smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong doesn\u2019t know how it\u2019s in other countries, but Bei Zhou always sends four men and four women, eight players. It so happens that bengong is also a participant this year and bengong also knows the other three players. There isn\u2019t anybody in Bei Zhou who doesn\u2019t know that bengong likes Cang gege. If they want to block bengong\u2019s fate, bengong won\u2019t go easy on them! Bengong will come forward for this matter, they won\u2019t not give me face. By that time, even if Cang gege has the heart, he will be powerless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there are always exceptions\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! If they can\u2019t be used by bengong, then there\u2019s no need to keep them!\u201d</p><br/><p>She means that if they can\u2019t be used by her, then they must die.</p><br/><p>The last sentence, Wanyan Bao Zhu said it like to chop the nail and slice the iron. The viciousness on her face was no different from Chou er\u2019s.</p><br/><p>To chop a nail and slice the iron: resolute and decisive, unhesitating</p><br/>\n</div>"}

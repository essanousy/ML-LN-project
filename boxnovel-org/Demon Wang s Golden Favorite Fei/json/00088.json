Women were weak and needed to rely on a man to survive. That\u2019s why they needed to be humble and do everything with the man in the center. They would be played by men. A woman like Guli, being so bold in public, a woman playing with \u2018men\u2019, there were very few of them. Such a woman died, this world lost a wonderful little flower\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi squatted and closed Guli\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye1, let\u2019s find a place where you could see the mountains and rivers to bury Guli!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just now, they were hostile towards each other. Now, as a woman, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s soft spot had been awakened by Guli\u2019s last tears.</p><br/><p>Which woman was not a pure flower at first, when going into a man\u2019s arms with a heart full of love? But, only after experiencing betrayal would the evil in the heart of a woman breed and make them do deviant things. Guli was nothing but a pitiful person.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang helped Murong Qi Qi up and told the servants to bury Guli. When Helan Lian Yi saw that Guli had died, he only frowned and then left hurriedly with Long Duo.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting, interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upstairs in Cyclamen, Jia Lan sipped wine. Just now, he was upstairs and saw everything clearly. At this point, he somewhat understood why Feng Can took a fancy to Murong Qi Qi. This woman indeed had a talent to shock people and also had something that attracted the eyes of people. The dance of just now almost let him lose his soul and be in a daze\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Jia Lan, the knockout competition is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>One person came forward with a respectful attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is ready, only waiting for the tournament to begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan drank the last bottle of wine. He stood up and looked deeply once more at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake me to the venue. I want to check it personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in blue retreated to one side and then followed behind Jia Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, this time, our knockout competition will certainly make them shocked. This subordinate feels that if three people can pass, then it\u2019s already not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down on those people\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan wasn\u2019t as optimistic as the man in blue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever strong you are, there is always someone stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, sir Misha\u2019s seven level pagoda, even the disciples from the island, there weren\u2019t many who could pass it. Moreover, these contestants simply can not be compared to our Penglai island\u2019s people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, be careful, caution is the parent of safety. Who can guarantee that among these contestants, there\u2019s no black horse\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying that, suddenly in Jia Lan\u2019s mind appeared the image of Murong Qi Qi dancing. Don\u2019t know if that woman would participate in the tournament of the four countries or not. If she participates, then the outcome will really be something to look forward to!</p><br/><p>The duel ended with Guli\u2019s death and Helan Lian Yi losing a hundred thousand golden teals.</p><br/><p>Just when Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi were about to leave, suddenly Longze Jing Tian appeared in front of Murong Qi Qi. He stared deeply at her. In his eyes was a strong love.</p><br/><p>\u201cXian Er, is it you? I\u2019ve searched a long time for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s dance made Longze Jing Tian think about the day Du Xian Er saved him in the forest. Just now, when Murong Qi Qi was dancing, in his mind repeatedly appeared Du Xian Er, who had landed from the sky in front of him, fully clothed in white. When the two figures overlapped, they had actually matched so well.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing wang, please conduct yourself with dignity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi took one step back and went into Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about! If this is Jing wang\u2019s way to strike, I can only tell Jing wang that this way is a failure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even when Feng Cang, who was holding Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand, moved far away, Longze Jing Tian still looked infatuatedly at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cXian Er, is it you? In the end, is it really you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian\u2019s words went into Murong Qing Lian\u2019s ears, making her dislike this rubbish third big sister even more. Today, Murong Qi Qi let people be surprised. It\u2019s just, why was it that everywhere this woman went, she was able to seduce men? Feng Cang\u2019s eyes almost dropped honey and now Longze Jing Tian was also like that. Where was there anything good about this woman?! Murong Qing Lian bit her lips and mercilessly stamped on the ground.</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi arrived at Meixiang yuan2, Helan Lian Yi already let people send over a hundred thousand golden teals.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you count it? Inspect it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi drank a mouthful of tea and asked Su Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering miss, everything was real and the amount is also right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue laughed while answering. Her mood was very good. Before, Fang Jing was worried that building the world\u2019s best place for business would need a lot of capital. Now, miss only went away for a bit and came back with a hundred thousand golden teals. If Fang Jing saw it, he\u2019ll certainly be happy enough to die.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, be careful. Put it away in a safe place.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she finished talking, she turned and looked smilingly at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, you have wealth equivalent to that of an entire nation. I\u2019m afraid that these hundred thousand golden teals certainly won\u2019t enter your eyes. Take it as if I won some pocket money, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyi, who was listening to this, almost spouted out blood. Wangfei3 really has an appetite of a lion, ah! Where in this world was there a woman who would take a hundred thousand golden teals as pocket money? Even the princesses in the palace didn\u2019t have this much pocket money, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, this money was given to you by Helan Lian Yi to lessen your shock. Naturally, it\u2019s your money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang smiled, and Ruyi almost bit off his tongue. Master pampers wangfei too much! But having said that, this money was indeed earned by wangfei herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, thanking wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi quickly stood up and bowed towards Feng Cang. She didn\u2019t even bow yet, when she was pulled into Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, don\u2019t you need to confess something? Hmm\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang stretched out his voice. Su Yue and the others saw that, and they knew that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi had something to talk about, so they retreated. When they left, they specially closed the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is wangye talking about? Confess what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi blinked her eyes innocently as if she didn\u2019t understand what Feng Cang meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like that, Feng Cang didn\u2019t want to force her. As long as she\u2019s safe and happy, it\u2019s enough!</p><br/><p>Feng Cang pinched Murong Qi Qi\u2019s nose. His eyes were full of pampering and love.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou having a little secret, I don\u2019t mind that. I\u2019m willing to wait for the day you completely open your heart. Just, next time when you encounter such a thing again, tell me in advance, lest to let me worry so much at one side!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t continue to pursue the matter, but let her keep some private space, making Murong Qi Qi very moved. She took the initiative to go into Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang, you really are good to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing is also not bad towards me, ah! Today, who repeatedly said \u2018Feng Cang is my man\u2019 in front of everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face turned red when Feng Cang mentioned this. Originally, she said those words to anger Guli and also at the same time, beat back those ill-intentioned women like Murong Qing Lian, who wanted to covet Feng Cang. She didn\u2019t think much about it. Unexpectedly, Feng Cang let those words enter his mind. Really embarrassing, ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, you said them so righteously, how come you\u2019re shy now? My reputation has been ruined by you. Qing Qing, you say, shouldn\u2019t you compensate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s devilishly beautiful face moved closer to Murong Qi Qi. That pair of quiet eyes was full of spring, making Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but put her hands on Feng Cang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang, you look really charming\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi saying such a praise, made Feng Cang give her a knowing smile. He put her jade-like hand against his lips and kissed it gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, if I was a woman and you praised me like that, I will feel happy. But, I\u2019m a man. Being praised like a woman, I\u2019m very sad. Could it be that Qing Qing is saying I\u2019m very sissy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi immediately gestured with her hand and quickly denied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just never have seen such a man like you. You\u2019re really a devilish beauty!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he heard \u2018devilish beauty\u2019, Feng Cang raised his head and casted a flirtatious glance at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Qing Qing praise me as a devilish beauty; if I don\u2019t do something to tempt you, then wouldn\u2019t I not be living up to Qing Qing\u2019s praise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to understand, Feng Cang\u2019s handsome face moved over. Red lips leaned closer, seizing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s petal-like soft lips and gently sucked on them.</p><br/><p>Sweet with a taste of green apples making a person float. Moreover, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips were extremely soft. It was like kissing soft clouds. Feng Cang gently bit on her soft lips. He didn\u2019t dare to use force in fear of hurting her</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face turned red because of shyness. She closed her eyes and moaned once. She didn\u2019t think that the heat on her lips would stop. She opened her eyes. Feng Cang\u2019s handsome face was red, but his eyes were full of worries.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Qing Qing, did I hurt you with the biting?\u201d</p><br/><p>So, it turned out, that the moan of Murong Qi Qi, in Feng Cang\u2019s ears, it sounded like he had hurt her. That\u2019s why he stopped.</p><br/><p>Looking at Feng Cang\u2019s uneasy expression and his red face, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart jumped badly. This man is too cute! What kind of hearing is that, ah? To actually turn comfortable into pain. Is it that he has never kissed before?</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi once again looked at Feng Cang. Feng Cang\u2019s face turned redder. He didn\u2019t dare look at Murong Qi Qi. Their gaze just met for a moment, and then he quickly turned to look somewhere at the roof. Now, Murong Qi Qi was more certain about her thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, could it be that you\u2019ve never kissed a girl before?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi asked carefully. Her eyes were locked on Feng Cang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Now, Feng Cang\u2019s face burned completely. So hot, it was painful.</p><br/><p>What should he do? Could it be that just now, he had hurt her while biting? So embarrassed, he wanted to die. Why did such a thing happen? The first time he kissed and he left such a bad impression on Murong Qi Qi. Will she laugh at him?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the first time that Murong Qi Qi saw such a shy Feng Cang. She didn\u2019t think that he would be this shy. Blood could now be pinched out of that handsome face. He looked so brightly red, very devilishly beautiful. It\u2019s just that this man was shy because of a kiss, really too cute! Just now, he just sucked her lips like a baby. Could it be that he thinks that this is kissing?!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing is laughing at me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Being laughed at by Muong Qi Qi, Feng Cang\u2019s male self-esteem was completely blown away. He had coveted for a long time, before he got the courage today to eat Murong Qi Qi\u2019s tofu. But the result was like this. Such a shame, ah!</p><br/><p>Eat tofu: take advantage in a sexual manner</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang like that, Murong Qi Qi quickly moved to him and nestled inside Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I\u2019m very happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pointed at her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere is truly very happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like men who are clean like wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>So, it\u2019s like that\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t know why, after hearing those words, Feng Cang felt relieved. It\u2019s as if a big mountain had been pressing on his shoulder and was now completely put down. So, it was like that\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is wangye\u2019s first kiss, I\u2019m very happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi raised her head while laughing. Such a bright face made Feng Cang lose his soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, just now you didn\u2019t hurt me\u2026\u2026it\u2019s just kissing is not like that\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands hooked Feng Cang\u2019s neck to let him lower his head. She took the initiative to give him her lips.</p><br/><p>Four soft sides touched each other. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s naughty tongue slowly entered Feng Cang\u2019s mouth. Feng Cang looked at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face with his eyes wide open. He looked straight at Murong Qi Qi. His face was full of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cFool, close your eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi blushed. Feng Cang quickly closed his eyes. He did as Murong Qi Qi and stuck out his tongue.</p><br/><p>So, kissing is like this, ah! Feng Cang finally understood that the dabble and stop of just now was not considered kissing. Such a lingering was a real kiss. So, it\u2019s like this!</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi initiated it, but she\u2019s also inexperienced. Feng Cang secretly opened his eyes and looked at Murong Qi Qi. She was drunkenly into the kiss with her eyes closed. That face, as small as a palm, was pinkish because of shyness. Looking at that face, it was even more moving.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s also the first time for his Qing Qing! Feng Cang\u2019s heart beat happily! She\u2019s so sweet with a fragrance of green apples, making him unwilling to let this love go.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Feng Cang pushed Murong Qi Qi away. He panted.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, can\u2019t anymore! I\u2019m afraid that if we continue like this, I will be unable to hold myself in and will want to eat you today!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes were full of daze and temptation, stimulating all of Feng Cang\u2019s senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang once again pulled Murong Qi Qi into his embrace. Red lips fell, not on her lips but on her smooth forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I love you! However, no matter how much I love you, how much I want to have you completely, I must wait till the wedding night! I want to give you an unparalleled wedding. I want to let you become my most beautiful bride! I don\u2019t want to destroy the sacredness of a marriage! Qing Qing, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>This man, ah\u2026\u2026leaning against Feng Cang\u2019s chest, listening to his rapid heartbeat, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart felt sweet as honey.</p><br/><p>Being so close to him, she could sense his restlessness. However, he was still trying to suppress himself. His speech also expressed the voice in his heart. Obviously, he wanted to get it so much, but he still bore with it. She really didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. She could only nestle quietly in his arms and enjoyed this beautiful sweetness\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Because of the kiss, Feng Cang\u2019s and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s feelings once again reached another level. And at Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s, she was creating a plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, I brought the drug.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yong er4 marched into the room, bringing the taste of the night with her. She handed Wanyan Bao Zhu a packet of drug.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe doctor said, as long as you put a little in the food; within an hour, it\u2019ll cause diarrhea. Even the wisest doctor wouldn\u2019t be able to cure it in an instant. Having diarrhea for a couple of days, even the healthiest people will not be able to walk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu took out a hairpin and handed it over to Yong er.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a reward for you. Take good care of it! Tomorrow morning, slip into the small kitchen and put the drug in the dishes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks princess! This slave will definitely complete the task!\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting the hairpin, Yong er retreated cheerfully. Don\u2019t know what happened to Wanyan Bao Zhu recently. She didn\u2019t follow Feng Cang with an infatuated look anymore. She stayed at home every day, but she\u2019s a lot more generous than in the past. She had gifted Yong er several accessories by now, making Yong er surprised and a lot more happier. She felt that because Ning er had died and Chou er left, princess was now even more attentive towards her. That\u2019s why she had been so generous.</p><br/><p>Yong er was grateful to Wanyan Bao Zhu from the bottom of her heart. So, she put more effort into doing the errands for Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>Seeing the happy expression on Yong er when she retreated, Wanyan Bao Zhu humphed coldly. Really shortsighted. With only a few jewelries, she had been bribed the moment she told what she had heard this morning; Murong Qi Qi had actually defeated Nan Feng\u2019s contestant. Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart wrung together.</p><br/><p>Why was this woman so lucky? When did she learn martial arts? Why had she never heard about it? Or was it that Murong Qi Qi was a very deep schemer and had been hiding it? Thinking till here, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t help but think about those corpses from Wu Ji Gong outside the city. Could it be that all those people had been killed by Murong Qi Qi? If it\u2019s really like that, then Murong Qi Qi was truly very frightening!</p><br/><p>A question had been entangled in Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart all this time. It was about the cause of Zhao Lang\u2019s death and also the cause of the deaths of those people from Wu Ji Gong and the real princess. Now, Murong Qi Qi knew martial arts. Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t help but put these two things together. Could these have been done by Murong Qi Qi?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just, no matter how Wanyan Bao Zhu thought about this question, she couldn\u2019t find the answer. As for Mu Yu Die, since she had returned, she was a bit out of her mind. She had been having that dazed and foolish expression. Although Jin Mo prescribed medicine for her, but wanting to get something out of her in a short period of time, was impossible. Now, the only thing she (WBZ) could do was to let every contestant unable to participate in the tournament. By then, she\u2019d see how Murong Qi Qi could continue to be Nan Lin wangfei!</p><br/><p>The next morning, noon hadn\u2019t even been reached, when from the other yuans came the news that every contestant ate the wrong thing, got a bad stomachache and had diarrhea. When Feng Cang and Jin Mo arrived, aside from Wanyan Kang who had slept in and didn\u2019t eat breakfast, the others were pale-faced.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang coldly swept around once. When his gaze met Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s, Wanyan Bao Zhu got a guilty conscience and slightly lowered her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, someone put this in the dishes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang handed a paper found at the corner of the kitchen to Feng Cang. Jin Mo took it and sniffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Croton powder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCroton powder?\u201d</p><br/><p>Using Croton powder wouldn\u2019t harm people\u2019s life, but would make people need to go to the bathroom till their legs turned weak. They wouldn\u2019t be able to participate in the tournament.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang let people bring out a person who was tied. The moment they looked, they saw it was Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s maid Yong er.</p><br/><p>\u201cI investigated everyone. She went into the kitchen this morning and acted very sneaky. It\u2019s definitely her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, who let you do it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice was calm, but the indifference and coldness inside it, let Yong er shiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

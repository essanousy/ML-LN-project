Go away!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who spoke was the fifth prince, consort De\u2019s son Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>Seeing the three-clawed dragon embroidered on the other party\u2019s clothes, Murong Qi Qi guessed that he was a prince of Bei Zhou. As for his \u2018ugly thing\u2019, she didn\u2019t put that in her heart. She just gently said thanks and then retreated to one side to watch the play.</p><br/><p>This woman didn\u2019t get angry? This made Wanyan Kang somewhat curious. He couldn\u2019t help but look at Murong Qi Qi twice more.</p><br/><p>He was just kind-hearted and happened to pick up the woman who was falling to the ground. After seeing her appearance, while he was at it, he also donated her an \u2018ugly thing\u2019 sentence. Originally, he thought that this woman would cry. He didn\u2019t expect that her response would be so calm.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she didn\u2019t seem to be in a bit of panic or feeling sad. Weren\u2019t women most concerned about their faces? Looking at her face, he was sure that he hadn\u2019t seen her before. Which family was this girl from? She\u2019s somewhat interesting, somewhat interesting!</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth younger brother, princess and miss Mu fell into the water!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Yu Shi Shi saw Wanyan Kang, she acted as if she saw a \u2018savior\u2019. She immediately stepped forward to ask for help and also interrupted Wanyan Kang\u2019s interest in Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Seeing Yu Shi Shi, Wanyan Kang changed his expression to a face with a mischievous smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, wanting to take a bath, don\u2019t need be like this, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the words coming from his mouth were very vicious, but Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t watch the play. He stepped onto the surface of the water and came towards the two people. Each hand grabbed one at their hair, pulled them up and threw them onto the stone arch bridge. Then he also turned and went on the stone bridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister must be in a good mood to actually play in the water with miss Mu! It\u2019s just that it\u2019s this cold. Can\u2019t you feel it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Wanyan Kang say that, Wanyan Bao Zhu began to feel cold. Soon afterwards, she sneezed twice. Ning er1 took a blanket to wrap her in it. On the other side, there were also palace maids who wrapped the shaking Mu Yu Die in a blanket.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t expect that this matter would be finished like this. Murong Qi Qi felt a bit regretful. According to her plan, she would\u2019ve wanted to let them stay in the water for a bit longer. However, a Chen Yaojin happened to suddenly appear.</p><br/><p>Chen Yaojin was a general who served in the Tang dynasty. The Chinese saying \u2018Chen Yaojin shows up suddenly along the way\u2019 is used to describe a situation where someone shows up unexpectedly and disrupts the plan</p><br/><p>In others\u2019 eyes, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expression looked like she was kind of \u2018frightened\u2019. Yu Shi Shi\u2019s eyes swept once over Murong Qi Qi. Seeing her like that, she humphed lightly. In the end, she was someone useless. Just like this, she was frightened.</p><br/><p>However, let them misunderstand! She didn\u2019t have much time to fight over jealousy with these women. If she had that energy, she might as well go take care of \u2018the world\u2019s best place for business\u2019. By then, it\u2019s also good to play an owner.</p><br/><p>As for the man of just now; he turned out to be fifth prince Wanyan Kang. No wonder that he would call her an \u2018ugly thing\u2019.</p><br/><p>It was said that this fifth prince of Bei Zhou was extremely fond of beautiful things and beautiful people. In his eyes, everything that is plain and ordinary is ugly. Not to mention that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s appearance was now only ordinary, naturally she would be classified in the category \u2018ugly thing\u2019 by him. This prince was a weird one of the imperial family.</p><br/><p>Just in a moment, what happened at Sun and Moon lake had been reported to Taiji Hall. The moment he heard that Murong Qi Qi was there, Feng Cang didn\u2019t have the time to say something to Wanyan Lie. His body flashed and he rushed to the lake.</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang like that, empress Li Bing was now even more certain about the conclusion of her guess. This Nan Lin wang2 really fell in love with that princess who had come to form a marriage alliance. If it wasn\u2019t like that, then why would he be so preoccupied and his mind elsewhere ever since the moment Murong Qi Qi left? His concern wasn\u2019t fake now that there\u2019s a problem.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the idiom even heroes have a weakness for the charms of a beautiful woman was not false. Although Murong Qi Qi was not a beauty, but in the lover\u2019s eyes, she was. In Feng Cang\u2019s eyes, Murong Qi Qi was a thousand times, ten thousand times better than Xi Shi.</p><br/><p>Xi Shi is one of the four most beautiful women of China. Legend has it that she was so beautiful that even fishes will drown while staring at her. She lived in the times where Yue and Wu states were at war. Yue was defeated. The ministers of Yue suggested to offer beautiful women to the king of Wu as the king of Wu was known for being unable to resist beauties. One of the ministers Fan Li found Xi Shi. While training her, they fell in love with each other. However, Fan Li still gave her to the king of Wu. The king of Wu was so bewitched by her that he neglected state affairs and killed his best advisor. The king of Wu even built the Palace of Beautiful Women for her. The strength of Wu dwindled and the king of Yue launched his revenge. In the end, the king of Wu was defeated and committed suicide. There are many versions of what happened to Xi Shi afterwards. The most known is that she drowned in the river. Another version is that she and Fan Li went away and no one ever saw them again. The other three beauties were Wang Zhaojun, Diaochan and the most famous of them all Yang Guifei (noble consort Yang). The sad thing is, they all died young hence there\u2019s a Chinese idiom ???? (hong yan bo ming) which means beautiful women suffer unhappy fates.</p><br/><p>Since things were like this, the matter would be easy to handle. The old madam would surely not be able to tolerate Murong Qi Qi. If she helped and let Feng Cang get the beauty, then maybe Feng Cang would help Wanyan Hong to the throne.</p><br/><p>This man, the moment he wanted to do something, he would certainly get it done. Rather than let him get his wish with his own power, she should let him be in debt with her. By that time, she can than mention her conditions.</p><br/><p>At the Sun and Moon lake, the crown princess saw Feng Cang come over. Wanyan Hong followed behind him. He will not let Feng Cang and Yu Shi Shi have the opportunity to be alone together. Even if he doesn\u2019t like this woman, but she is his. He won\u2019t let anyone touch her. Even if he destroys her, she is his.</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang arrived, Murong Qi Qi and the others had already moved to the nearest Orchid Palace. The palace maids brought warm water. Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die were bathing. Murong Qi Qi and Yu Shi Shi waited outside.</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi was somewhat anxious because such a thing happened. What excuse should she use to let herself not suffer any blame? After all, among these people, she was the crown princess and also the eldest. Consort De also repeatedly told her to take care of them. She didn\u2019t expect that princess and the prime minister\u2019s granddaughter would fall into the lake. What should she do?!</p><br/><p>Although the prime minister supported second prince Wanyan Yi, but on the surface, she still need to act decent. If people say that she was deliberately looking for an opportunity to make things difficult for Mu Yu Die, then even if she had ten mouths, she wouldn\u2019t be able to clear herself.</p><br/><p>She had been married into the imperial family for many years now. She had seen many similar matters which were turned upside down. As long as there were political issues involved, even if it\u2019s the size of a sesame, in the end it can be rendered to an immeasurable point. Now Yu Shi Shi was no longer in the mood to laugh at Murong Qi Qi. She was worried about today\u2019s matter. Will it cause the prime minster to misunderstand? Will it affect Wanyan Hong\u2019s \u2018great cause\u2019?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pretended that she didn\u2019t see Yu Shi Shi\u2019s tension. She kept her head down and played with her fingers. Now she (YSS) knows how to be afraid? Just now, what did she (YSS) do? Whatever, this matter has nothing to do with her, Murong Qi Qi. She only needs to watch the play.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi playing with her fingers, attracted the attention of Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>The \u2018ugly thing\u2019 sentence just now didn\u2019t make Murong Qi Qi cry, which already let Wanyan Kang be very surprised. In his memory, as long as it\u2019s a woman hearing another say she is ugly, even if she doesn\u2019t cry, she would sulk. However, this girl seemed like she didn\u2019t hear anything. Very interesting!</p><br/><p>For the first time, Wanyan Kang discovered such a \u2018unique\u2019 woman. So, he also followed to Orchid Palace. Seeing Murong Qi Qi play with her fingers, he came to her and looked at her playing with her fingers. Just one look, Wanyan Kang couldn\u2019t take his eyes off them anymore. This person is an \u2018ugly thing\u2019. So why are her hands so beautiful?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, ugly thing. Your hands are quite beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang was but seventeen or eighteen. He was wearing a silver robe. He had small eyes and long eyebrows. He looked somewhat like Wanyan Hong, but he didn\u2019t have Wanyan Hong\u2019s dark aura. Instead, he seemed bright and someone to trifle without respect accompanied with the noble aura at his every gesture, he had a hint of the taste of a black belly. Plus, the smirk he had on his mouth, with one look you would know that he\u2019s a spoiled prince.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi raised her head and smiled sweetly: \u201cOnce, someone else said so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that someone has the same \u2018standard of appreciating beautiful things\u2019 as him, Wanyan Kang immediately became interested. He must get to know that person and learn from each other about the perception of \u2018beauty\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi hasn\u2019t finished yet, when she fell into a familiar embrace. And Wanyan Kang at her side was sent flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, are you alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang quickly checked Murong Qi Qi from head to toe. Only after seeing that she didn\u2019t get hurt, did he let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>At the other side, Wanyan Kang sensed a murderous aura. He quickly turned around and hid nearby. Only after he stood firm, did he see Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, you want to commit homicide, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang immediately shouted exaggeratedly. However, there\u2019s happiness on his face. This Wanyan Kang had always had a good relationship with Feng Cang. Seeing that Feng Cang had returned, he immediately went forward and wanted to give him a hug.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t reached Feng Cang yet, when Murong Qi Qi shouted to stop him. Only then did Wanyan Kang see Murong Qi Qi\u2019s and Feng Cang\u2019s posture. It\u2019s very amorous. Very, very amorous! Murong Qi Qi was entirely in Feng Cang\u2019s embrace. Wanyan Kang had never seen such a scene before. His chin almost fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth royal highness, you have bad habits. That\u2019s alright. It\u2019s your choice, but don\u2019t stick to our family\u2019s wangye, ah! Otherwise, if outsiders see it, they would think our family\u2019s wangye is a cut sleeve. How would that be alright?!</p><br/><p>cut sleeve: euphemism for homosexuality, originating from History of Western Han: emperor Han Aidi (real name Liu Xin) was in bed with his lover Dong Xian, and had to attend a court audience that morning. Not wishing to awaken Dong Xian, who was sleeping with his head resting on the emperor\u2019s long robe sleeve, Aidi used a knife to cut off the lower half of his sleeve.</p><br/><p> Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice was sweet and gentle, making the hearts of the people who hear it turn soft and itchy. However, the words coming out of her mouth was able to anger people to death! Wanyan Kang understood that Murong Qi Qi was ridiculing him by saying he\u2019s a cut sleeve. This made Wanyan Kang so angry that he nearly went mad!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that?! I\u2019m not a cut sleeve! I like women! Women, do you understand, ugly thing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang using \u2018ugly thing\u2019 to describe Murong Qi Qi made Feng Cang\u2019s expression sank: \u201cWanyan Kang, who did you call ugly thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI say it\u2019s\u2026\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Kang suddenly paused. He looked at Murong Qi Qi and then looked at Feng Cang. He has an expression of sudden realization.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, she\u2019s the princes who came for a marriage alliance? She\u2019s that mysterious woman you hid in Tingsong building? She\u2019s the Murong Qi Qi for who you went into a confrontation with grandmother and also wanted to give up the tiger tally?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s bengong.3 Thanking royal highness for your help just now, thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi wanted to pay her respect to Wanyan Kang. Unexpectedly, she didn\u2019t get the chance to move as Wanyan Kang got out of the way and waved with his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no. I don\u2019t want you to pay me respect! In the future, you will be my cousin-in-law. Making cousin-in-law pay respect to me will have my life shortened. This young master doesn\u2019t want that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Feng Cang\u2019s expression turned better after Wanyan Kang used \u2018cousin-in-law\u2019 to call Murong Qi Qi and didn\u2019t bother him (WK) anymore about the \u2018ugly thing\u2019 of just now. After seeing Feng Cang\u2019s expression had turned better, Wanyan Kang let out a relieved breath. Hu hu, that was a close call, ah! If he had known Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity, he wouldn\u2019t have made cousin brother angry!</p><br/><p>Seeing Wanyan Kang\u2019s relieved expression, Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but want to tease him. Just now, he called her \u2018ugly thing\u2019 many times. She didn\u2019t bother with it, but that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t angry. After all, there are no women who liked to be called that.</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi smiled at Wanyan Kang. This smile was sweet like flowers in the spring, but Wanyan Kang keenly sensed conspiracy inside it. His heart alarmed. This woman didn\u2019t make her identity known before, making cousin brother swat him like a fly. What kind of tricks does she want to play now?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, didn\u2019t royal highness want to know who else praised my hands for being beautiful? It\u2019s wangye, ah! When I met wangye for the first time, wangye said my hands are beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stretched her arms out to show Wanyan Kang her white jade-like small hands.</p><br/><p>Very beautiful, ah! Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands, Wanyan Kang was in a daze for a moment. It\u2019s the first time he has seen such beautiful hands! Really don\u2019t know how they will feel when touched\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Wanyan Kang\u2019s fantasy to finish, a gust of wind came towards him. Danger! Wanyan Kang\u2019s heart was exclaiming that this was bad. He quickly got out of the way, but was a beat too slow. Finally, he fell on his butt on the ground. So painful that he gritted his teeth to not make a sound.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands were already in Feng Cang\u2019s palms. He personally hid Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands in her sleeves and didn\u2019t let Wanyan Kang have the chance to take even one more glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being fanned by Feng Cang to the ground in front of so many people, Wanyan Kang\u2019s expression turned very ugly. He finally knew that Murong Qi Qi did that on purpose. Her motive was to provoke the contradiction between him and Feng Cang. Right, that woman must be thinking that!</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, didn\u2019t royal highness use ugly thing to call me again and again? Could it be that royal highness doesn\u2019t know that a woman\u2019s heart is as small as a needle? Everything else that can be said is alright with me, but I\u2019m very narrow-minded. I remember very well all who bullied or offended me. Royal highness, I have a name. My name is not ugly thing. If next time royal highness is as impolite, then I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will you do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang stood up and rubbed his butt. Feng Cang went too hard on him. Was she not just an ugly thing?! He (FC) actually used his hands on him (WK). Really too mean!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I can only ask wangye for help!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi putting Feng Cang out made Wanyan Kang completely not have a way out. Just now, Feng Cang\u2019s eyes were like blades. If they were really blades, then he (WK) was afraid that his (WK) eyes would\u2019ve been dug out by now. Before, Wanyan Kang only heard that Feng Cang pampered Murong Qi Qi very much. He didn\u2019t expect that he pampered her to this extent.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that cousin brother\u2019s possessiveness was too much! He just looked once, only once, and he (FC) felt the need to displace a killing intent! Wanyan Kang is not a fool. He saw very clearly how much Feng Cang cared about Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>At this point, Wanyan Kang made up his mind. In the future, he needs to mingle with Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Since Murong Qi Qi was the person in Feng Cang\u2019s heart, he only needed to get in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s favor. Then, Feng Cang cousin brother will certainly be happy. By that time, he (FC) might let him (WK) train in the military, lest to not let him be idle in the capital all day long.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019m afraid of you! I apologize to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Here he doesn\u2019t mean he is afraid of MQQ. Chinese use the phrase \u2018I\u2019m afraid of you\u2019 when they admit defeat and can\u2019t endure it any longer.</p><br/><p>After Wanyan Kang said that, he actually bowed to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, forgive this little brother! This little brother has eyes but fail to recognize Mount Tai! In the future, such a thing won\u2019t happen again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Have eyes but fail to recognize Mount Tai: fail to recognize somebody important; to be blind to the fact. Mount Tai is a mountain with historical and cultural significance in China. It\u2019s the most sacred mountain of China. It\u2019s associated with sunrise, birth and renewal.</p><br/><p>This bow let Murong Qi Qi know this prince\u2019s personality. Didn\u2019t think that in the palace of Bei Zhou, there\u2019s actually such an interesting person! Seeing Feng Cang, their relationship doesn\u2019t seem bad. Then, she will consider him as one of their own!</p><br/><p>Originally, Yu Shi Shi was thinking about how to solve the problem. Ever since Feng Cang appeared, she had been repressing her heartbeat. Her eyes were following him. After witnessing how Feng Cang pampered Murong Qi Qi, Yu Shi Shi\u2019s heart was in pain like a knife was digging at it. Especially when Murong Qi Qi used \u2018our family\u2019s wangye\u2019 again and again, her voice was very ear-piercing.</p><br/><p>Now, seeing that Murong Qi Qi was able to get familiar with Wanyan Kang, who had the weirdest personality of the imperial family, in such a short time, Yu Shi Shi\u2019s expression looked somewhat bad. Plus, hearing Wanyan Kang calling Murong Qi Qi \u2018cousin-in-law\u2019, Yu Shi Shi\u2019s jealousy expanded completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth little brother, princess Zhao Yang and wangye\u2019s marriage isn\u2019t set yet. You saying it like this would make people misunderstand. It\u2019s not good for the reputation of a girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi softly opened her mouth. Every word was like, she was considerate about Murong Qi Qi. However, coming out of her mouth, the words revealed a deep jealousy.</p><br/><p>How would Wanyan Kang not know what Yu Shi Shi was thinking? He grinned and lightly humphed from his nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial sister-in-law, the person involved doesn\u2019t care, so why would you worry? In the end, is it cousin brother who is marrying or is it imperial brother who is marrying, ah? As long as cousin brother likes her, what does it matter what other people think?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang saying it so beautifully was very much to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s liking. Seeing Yu Shi Shi become so angry that even her nose was crooked, Murong Qi Qi wanted to laugh, but her face was full of modesty. The next moment, she stepped out of Feng Cang\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown princess is right. It\u2019s bengong who was negligent. Wangye, bengong is not wangfei yet, there are differences between man and woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi lowered her head slightly with a well-behaved expression. Seeing her like this, Yu Shi Shi\u2019s heart got somewhat more comfortable. After all, seeing Feng Cang embrace Murong Qi Qi was eye-piercing. Her eyes felt painful like a needle was poking into them.</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi wasn\u2019t even happy for two seconds, when Murong Qi Qi once again fell into Feng Cang\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is benwang\u2019s4 domestic affairs. Don\u2019t need to trouble crown princess to worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such cold words hit her directly like thorns, making Yu Shi Shi feel pain over her whole body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I did it for your own good\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Yu Shi Shi\u2019s tears were about to fall, a gloomy voice came from behind her: \u201cBeloved consort, can you put the heart of caring for other people onto this crown prince, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour, your highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Her expression immediately changed. From the one full of grieving to the now gentle and dignified expression. Such a fast change that even Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but want to raise her thumbs to praise her. Master, really a master! Changing expression is even faster than turning a page!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, how come you came?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi just turned, when she was locked into Wanyan Hong\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crown prince is worried about you, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong\u2019s eyes swept once over Feng Cang and Wanyan Kang. Finally, his eyes fell on Yu Shi Shi\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, good. You didn\u2019t lose anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made Yu Shi Shi extremely embarrassed and Murong Qi Qi was able to see how this couple got along with each other. However, Feng Cang didn\u2019t speak and Wanyan Kang was looking at the ceiling. He was even singing a song. Murong Qi Qi simply continued to pretend to be a small white rabbit.</p><br/><p>When emperor, empress, consort De and the others arrived, Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die had already changed into new clothes. Their hair were also neatly combed. There was not a single trace of the embarrassment of just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie looked at Yu Shi Shi. On the way here, Consort De Lin Ke Xin had explained what happened. Now, it\u2019s Yu Shi Shi\u2019s turn to explain.</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi explained what happened in a simple way. In the end, she added one more sentence: \u201cDaughter-in-law was a bit far and didn\u2019t see clearly. Princess Zhao Yang is one of the involved parties. Emperor father can ask princess Zhao Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL Note:</p><br/><p>When imperial family or court officials refer to themselves in front of someone of higher rank, they will use chen. For example, erchen (subject son/daughter, used by children of the emperor), chenqie (subject wife/concubine, used by wives of the imperial family), chenxi (subject daughter in law, used by daughter in laws of the emperor), chennu (daughter of your subject, used by daughters of officials). This means that before they are family, they are subject to the emperor first.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

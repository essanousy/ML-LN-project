Because he was accustomed to hearing her call him \u2018Cang\u2019, after hearing her now say his full name, Feng Cang was a bit surprised. However, from this, he could see Feng Qi Qi\u2019s seriousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will believe everything you say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words sounded like a promise, which made Feng Qi Qi smile. The mole between her eyebrows became instantly red like blood.</p><br/><p>How fortunate she was to be born again and meet Feng Cang\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not someone of your time and I\u2019m also not the real Feng Qi Qi. My name used to be Yi Lian. I came from the twenty-first century.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s voice was very gentle. Her soft hand was placed on Feng Cang\u2019s palm. In the spring, the white flowers bloomed in wangfu.1 The sun was already halfway down the hill. The orange glow spread evenly on Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi. From afar, they looked like a pair of immortals.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi began to tell everything, from when she was five years old and taken back to adoptive father\u2019s house. She spoke for a full two hours. After she finished her story, Feng Q Qi discovered that the sky had already become dark. Her body was covered with Feng Cang\u2019s coat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are saying that there is an era with rapid technological development? In another space and time? There, people can go into the sky and can go down the sea? The power of the car is not a horse but gasoline?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang couldn\u2019t imagine how the world Feng Qi Qi talked about was. Those words assembled into a picture in his mind, but no matter how he looked at it, he found it weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat place is too mystical!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026,\u201d Feng Qi Qi nestled in Feng Cang\u2019s arms. \u201cIf I could, I want to take you to the place where I grew up! I\u2019ve lived there for more than twenty years. I really like it there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi said that she liked the previous world. This made Feng Cang\u2019s hand tighten. He firmly held Feng Qi Qi. He was afraid that during a moment of carelessness, she would return to the previous world.</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang act so carefully, Feng Qi Qi sighed. Could it be that she looked so insecure?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will always be here and will always stay with you! Besides, at that side, I\u2019m already a dead person. After so long, my body would\u2019ve been sent to the crematorium and is now cremated. How can I go back?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Feng Qi Qi say that, Feng Cang frowned. On his devilish beautiful face appeared a strange emotion, \u201cSo, I should thank Lian Sheng. If it wasn\u2019t because of him, you wouldn\u2019t have come here and even more, it would be impossible for you to meet me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can say that.\u201d Feng Qi Qi nodded. Her mouth revealed a mocking mood. Indeed, if it wasn\u2019t because she\u2019d died from Lian Sheng\u2019s gun, then how would she have had the opportunity to time-travel and continue to live with the identity of Feng Qi Qi? How would she had fallen in love with Feng Cang, let alone be married to him?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Misha really is Lian Sheng, then he really is like the soul of a deceased has not yet dispersed.</p><br/><p>The soul of a deceased has not yet to be dispersed: too pestering</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words revealed a deep hatred and disgust for Lian Sheng.</p><br/><p>Although, when she\u2019d been describing Lian Sheng, Feng Qi Qi had only used a few words, but from Feng Qi Qi\u2019s voice, Feng Cang could hear the deep hatred she had for Lian Sheng. Especially, when at the end, she\u2019d mentioned how adoptive father had died at Lian Sheng\u2019s hands. Feng Qi Qi\u2019s body even shivered a bit.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang could understand Feng Qi Qi\u2019s mood. Just like that year when he\u2019d thought that Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue had died at Yandang mountain. At that time, his mood was also like this. He couldn\u2019t wait to find the enemy and pay him back with a tooth for a tooth and blood for blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, what kind of characteristics does Lian Sheng have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang gently stroked Feng Qi Qi\u2019s back. A warm current released from his hand and spread along Feng Qi Qi\u2019s back. A moment later, Feng Qi Qi\u2019s back became warm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very extreme. When he was warm, he was a gentleman. When he was crazy and irritable, he was a demon. His good and evil were only a hair\u2019s breadth apart. He was someone very extreme. As for his characteristics\u2026,\u201d Feng Qi Qi thought for a long while. Suddenly, her eyes lit up, \u201cHe likes to tap the table. Especially when he was in deep thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi flattened Feng Cang\u2019s palm. Her fingertips made \u2018da, da\u2019 sounds on his palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike this! Every time, when he made a decision, he liked to do this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang secretly remembered these characteristics of Lian Sheng that Feng Qi Qi mentioned.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he needed to let people monitor Misha. If Misha really had this habit, maybe he really was Lian Sheng. Since Lian Sheng owed Feng Qi Qi two lives, he would let Misha pay a debt of blood with blood.</p><br/><p>After she revealed her true identity, Feng Qi Qi had a relaxed feeling. She had come to this world for so long, yet she hadn\u2019t told anyone about her past. She hadn\u2019t revealed even a word to her personal maids, Su Mei and Su Yue.</p><br/><p>Today, Feng Qi Qi was very happy after telling Feng Cang everything. Because the feeling of sharing with others was so good. Particularly, after Feng Cang heard those words, he didn\u2019t think that she was saying nonsense and chose to believe her. This made Feng Qi Qi feel that she had an \u2018intimate friend\u2019. After all, that identity was the biggest secret to Feng Qi Qi. It felt very good, sharing her secrets with Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, if Misha is really Lian Sheng, then Lian Sheng has certainly come for you. Like you said, the contents of the seven-floor pagoda were the training you\u2019ve once done. Then, the one who made the tests of the seven-floor pagoda definitely must be linked in countless ways with Lian Sheng. I think, whether Misha is Lian Sheng or not, we should\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang made a gesture of a cutting knife.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t elaborate, but Feng Cang\u2019s intuition told him that this person\u2019s desire for \u2018Yi Lian\u2019 could only be described as crazy. If Misha was really Lian Sheng, then wouldn\u2019t he be looking everywhere for Feng Qi Qi? In the past life, he\u2019d killed her because he couldn\u2019t get her. Could it be that Lian Sheng still wanted to get her in this life?</p><br/><p>No! I will never allow such a thing to happen! No matter if she\u2019s Yi Lian or Feng Qi Qi, she is his wife. He would not let go and wouldn\u2019t let anyone have the opportunity to exploit!</p><br/><p>Knowing Feng Cang for so long, Feng Qi Qi was used to seeing him be as tender and soft as water, as light as the wind and as calm as the clouds. She had never seen him like this. That pair of flirtatious eyes was filled with a thick layer of haze. His voice was also lower than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang means that it\u2019s preferable to kill thousands wrongly than to let one go?\u201d Feng Qi Qi raised her hand and raised Feng Cang\u2019s chin. \u201cTsk, tsk, I was used to seeing your gentle side. I forgot that you have the nickname demon wang\u2026\u201d2</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Qing Qing wants to experience it?\u201d Feng Cang smiled enchantingly. He instantly put away the violence of his body. His eyes were full of love. He reached out, held Feng Qi Qi\u2019s hand and kissed her fingertips.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026,\u201d the feeling coming from her fingers made Feng Qi Qi laugh. \u201cCang, don\u2019t play anymore. So itchy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang lowered his head and bit Feng Qi Qi\u2019s earlobe. \u201cI will protect you like how a knight will always protect his princess and wouldn\u2019t let anyone get close!\u201d</p><br/><p>Warm air lingered on Feng Qi Qi\u2019s ear. Hearing the thick jealousy from Feng Cang\u2019s words, Feng Cang laughed and held his strong waist, \u201cGood, ah! My mighty knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>In just a night, more than a group of people appeared at the house where Misha lived. Some were Feng Cang\u2019s and some were Feng Qi Qi\u2019s. Fo Sheng Men\u2019s and Moyu\u2019s top masters were here and hid in the marketplace. There was only one goal for everyone and that was Misha.</p><br/><p>After arriving at Yan capital, Misha had been staying in the house and didn\u2019t go out. Because his legs were disabled, he didn\u2019t like to go on the streets. He didn\u2019t like the strange looks on other people\u2019s faces whenever they look at his legs. Although he had a deceptive face, but it was a fact that he was crippled.</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Xue, you still haven\u2019t found out about Su Mei?\u201d Misha was somewhat impatient. The weather was getting warmer, but his matter had been progressing so slowly. So many days had passed; why hadn\u2019t Xia Xue get the data about Su Mei yet?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2019 The whip in Misha\u2019s hand hit Xia Xue\u2019s legs fiercely, \u201cKneel!\u201d</p><br/><p>The coldness on the beautiful face in front of her made Xia Xue startled. She quickly knelt in front of Misha, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s Xia Xue\u2019s fault. Young master, don\u2019t get angry! Su Mei is princess Zhen Guo\u2019s personal maid. Feng Qi Qi is either in the palace or at the wangfu. I didn\u2019t have the chance to get close to Su Mei\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2019 Xia Xue didn\u2019t finish speaking. Her face felt pain. The right side of her face immediately became swollen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, Xia Xue didn\u2019t lie. This subordinate really couldn\u2019t find information about Su Mei. This subordinate has already tried her best\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t wait for Xia Xue to say more, Misha\u2019s whip let her face get one more whip mark. In the end, Xia Xue could only shut up. Although her expression was still cold, but her eyes obviously had a thick layer of grievance. She didn\u2019t know why Misha would treat her like this.</p><br/><p>Xia Xue\u2019s expression made Misha get in an even more bad mood. After hooking the whip, he brought Xia Xue in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Xue, are you very dissatisfied? You\u2019re thinking that this young master beat you wrongly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s voice was cool like mint, but the way he looked at Xia Xue didn\u2019t have the calmness of usual. This kind of alienation, indifference and the cold on her back made Xia Xue feel scared.</p><br/><p>Xia Xue didn\u2019t want Misha to lose the trust in her and didn\u2019t want him to alienate himself from her. She didn\u2019t want that! \u201cYoung master, Xia Xue doesn\u2019t feel wronged! Young master beat Xia Xue rightly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen say, what did you hide from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026,\u201d Xia Xue was surprised for a moment. Her chest tightened. She no longer spoke.</p><br/><p>Seeing her like this, Misha snorted. \u201cXia Xue, I\u2019ve said that I hate people lying to me the most. Why didn\u2019t you tell me that Su Mei is about to marry Bei Zhou\u2019s Xiaoyao wang? What more are you hiding from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue never thought that Misha actually found out about Su Mei\u2019s wedding. Who told him? Could it be sir Jia Lan? No, ah. How did sir Jia Lan know Su Mei? It couldn\u2019t be Jia Lan who\u2019d told him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think anymore\u2026,\u201d Misha suddenly disliked the woman in front of him a bit. She obviously knew his personality and still acted like this. Could it be that she did it on purpose?</p><br/><p>Seeing that Misha suspected her loyalty, Xia Xue immediately kowtowed and shouted injustice, \u201cYoung master, Xia Xue didn\u2019t betray you! Please, you have to believe in my loyalty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoyalty? Would someone loyal do such a thing? If it wasn\u2019t because I took a walk in the yard today and heard people from the outside talk about Xiaoyao wang\u2019s marriage, I wouldn\u2019t know even if Su Mei had already married!\u201d</p><br/><p>The last words were roared by Misha.</p><br/><p>After thinking that Su Mei might be Yi Lian and what Xia Xue had done could have made him lose Yi Lian forever, Misha\u2019s whip mercilessly fell on Xia Xue\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026pa, pa\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xia Xue was also made from flesh and blood. Misha was originally someone who practiced martial arts. The strength in his hand was great. Now, this whip hit her hard. It was so painful that Xia Xue frowned, but she didn\u2019t dare to make a sound.</p><br/><p>Because Su Mei\u2019s wedding was originally her (XX) fault. If she finds a reason to justify herself, she would definitely lose Misha\u2019s trust. Perhaps, Misha would send her away. No! She didn\u2019t want to leave young master! The most important person in her life was Misha. If she left Misha, what should she do? Xia Xue didn\u2019t dare to think about it.</p><br/><p>Only when Misha was tired from hitting did he throw the whip on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Xue, leave! I don\u2019t want you anymore!\u201d Misha turned the wheelchair. His back faced Xia Xue. He didn\u2019t look at Xia Xue who was full of black and blue wounds. His voice also didn\u2019t have a trace of warmness. Betraying once would lead to betraying every time. He didn\u2019t need such a disloyal slave at his side!</p><br/><p>Such words coming from Misha made the tears immediately fall out from Xia Xue. Just now, no matter how Misha punished her, Xia Xue didn\u2019t make a sound. She gritted her teeth as if the pain wasn\u2019t coming from her body, as if the one who had been beaten wasn\u2019t her. Now, a \u2018I don\u2019t want you\u2019 from Misha made all the emotion come up in Xia Xue\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t send Xia Xue away!\u201d Xia Xue knelt in front of Misha. Salty tears mixed with the whip marks on her face, making her twitch from pain. However, Xia Xue didn\u2019t had the mind to care about these now. She cared the most about Misha. If Misha didn\u2019t want her anymore, then where could she go?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, I was wrong! I shouldn\u2019t have kept Su Mei\u2019s matter a secret. It was my fault! Young master, don\u2019t send me away! I will never do this again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xue\u2019s appearance was extremely pitiful. She kept kowtowing and wanted to warm Misha\u2019s cold heart. She would rather Misha whip her than to lose Misha.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, give me one more chance! Young master, Xia Xue served you for so many years. Even if you don\u2019t do it for the monk, do it for Buddha. Spare me this time! Everything is my fault. Young master, don\u2019t be angry! Please, give me one more chance. I beg you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t do it for the monk, do it for Buddha: out of consideration</p><br/><p>The tears and the blood on her face merged together. At this time, Xia Xue\u2019s original features couldn\u2019t be seen on her originally pretty face. \u2018Bang, bang\u2019, sounds of the kowtow spread to Misha\u2019s ears, but he wasn\u2019t the slightest bit affected. Xia Xue was his closest person. She took care of his daily matters like food and clothing. If even Xia Xue hid things from him, lie to him, then, where would there be any sense of security?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, you can hit and scold me, but don\u2019t make me leave! If I leave, who will take care of young master?! Young master, it was my fault. Everything was my fault! I made you angry. I know I am wrong. I truly know I am wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xia Xue was very regretful. She had long known Yi Lian\u2019s existence was unmatched to anyone in Misha\u2019s heart, but she still had the wishful thinking that she could surpass the existence of Yi Lian and live in Misha\u2019s heart. So, that was why she kept Su Mei\u2019s wedding a secret because she didn\u2019t want Misha to find Yi Lian.</p><br/><p>Now, after seeing Misha\u2019s expression, Xia Xue finally understood, no one could replace Yi Lian\u2019s existence in Misha\u2019s heart. No matter how many things she did, Misha wouldn\u2019t turn around and give her a glance. He wouldn\u2019t give her the slightest pity. However, however, she still loved such a him, ah!</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s dark eyes coldly looked at the teary and bloodstained face of Xia Xue. His expression wasn\u2019t the slightest bit moved. How could he not know those thoughts of her? In the past life, there were also many women who threw themselves at him, but he only felt disdain and contempt towards them.</p><br/><p>If he wanted women, he only needed to flick his finger. At any time, there would be someone who would give her life to him. However, he didn\u2019t like those people. If there was no love, how could he do it\u2026He only loved Yi Lian. He liked that noble and unsullied fairylike lotus that sometimes would be charming like a Japanese rose woman. Compared to Yi Lian, these women were rubbish. When they see a man, they would throw themselves on him. Really extremely cheap!</p><br/><p>(y\u012b li\u00e1n): Lian means lotus</p><br/><p>1.

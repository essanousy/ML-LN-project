The people beside him were also very happy. It seemed that wangye1 and wangfei\u2019s2 relationship was very good. This was the thing that made people the happiest.</p><br/><p>The two kissed as if there was no one else around; as if in this world, there were only the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019 \u2018Boom!\u2019 Nine hundred ninety-nine fireworks were lit. The sky above the whole wangfu3 was bright like it was in the day. Gorgeous flowers bloomed in the blue sky. It attracted the attention of the whole capital and also alerted Wanyan Lie in the palace.</p><br/><p>Chinese people like 9 very much as 9 has the same pronunciation with  (Jiu, meaning everlasting). On the Valentine\u2019s Day, a man usually presents his lover with 99 or 999 roses to symbolize eternal love.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Jing De, let someone go take a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie put down the memorials he was looking at. He walked to the window and looked at the colorful piece of sky not far away. He frowned, \u201cIt seems to be in the direction of Nan Lin wangfu. Quickly, let people go check what happened!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only the palace, the embassy where Xi Qi\u2019s people were staying at had also been alarmed.</p><br/><p>Looking at the sky full of fireworks above Nan Lin wangfu, Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s lips were in a tight line. Since he escorted Murong Qi Qi to Bei Zhou till now, his task had been to wait for the wedding of Murong Qi Qi. After seeing her happily become Feng Cang\u2019s wife, his mission would be completed.</p><br/><p>It was just, now, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wedding was getting closer, so close that he didn\u2019t dare to go to Nan Lin wangfu. He was afraid that after seeing Murong Qi Qi, he wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand that kind of heart-tearing pain. Although in his heart, he wanted to see her, but now seeing her had also became a luxurious thing in his life. Since it was like that, it would be better to not see her or meet her. She would always stay in his heart as a young girl; she won\u2019t change, won\u2019t get old and would just stay there\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened at Nan Lin wangfu?\u201d Longze Jing Tian had let someone go inquire. After a while, the person came back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering wangye, Nan Lin wang proposed to princess Zhao Yang! It\u2019s said, he prepared nine hundred and ninety-nine fireworks\u2026As for what this proposing thing is, this subordinate didn\u2019t found out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPropose?\u201d Looking at the sky of the night blooming with beautiful fireworks, Longze Jing Tian went silent. In his mind, he fantasied about how gorgeous Murong Qi Qi would smile under this piece of colorful sky.</p><br/><p>Did he really miss it? Although Longze Jing Tian had let people find crown princess Yu Shi Shi before he came to Bei Zhou and wanted her to make trouble between those two, but it seemed that that woman wasn\u2019t of any use.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the most critical thing was that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart had moved for Feng Cang. She seemed to have fallen in love with him. Even if he got her back; a woman who had another man living in her heart, would she still try to give him love?</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian frowned and stared at that piece of colorful sky. He didn\u2019t speak a word. What should he do? Let go and let her be happy? He wasn\u2019t so generous. However, if he forced her to stay at his side, looking at her smile gradually disappear; he also couldn\u2019t do it. What should he do?</p><br/><p>Regardless of what Shangguan Wu Ji and Longze Jing Tian were thinking; aside from feeling a loss, Li Yun Qing\u2019s heart was calm. He had seen that man and also met him. He had the appearance of a celestial being and was the proud son of heaven. Only such a man was worthy of her.</p><br/><p>From now on, with her, he would only have the blood relationship of being her cousin brother and nothing more. Aside from hiding all his love in his heart, what more could he do?! In the vast sea of people, finding the only partner for life and get him/her; my fortune is not my life\u2026if she\u2019s happy, isn\u2019t that what he wanted?</p><br/><p>The three men didn\u2019t talk, making the atmosphere a bit heavy.</p><br/><p>After Bai Yi Yue heard that Feng Cang used such a large scale to get the beauty to smile, she felt happy for Murong Qi Qi from the bottom of her heart. This girl showed her true temperament. No matter if it was putting on airs or being overbearing or flying full of passion; all were the true her, making Bai Yi Yue like her although they\u2019re the same sex; not to mention the opposite sex!</p><br/><p>At this time, only one person\u2019s mood was the worst.</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian bit her lips and stared at the sky above Nan Lin wangfu. She was so envious. Why wasn\u2019t she as lucky as Murong Qi Qi?! Why, after so long, was Longze Jing Tian still so cold towards her? Why was it that everyone felt Murong Qi Qi was great even though she\u2019s (MQL) much better than her (MQQ)?</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian completely forgot that Murong Qi Qi acted mercifully towards her at the tournament of the four countries. Now, Murong Qi Qi was at Nan Lin wangfu and didn\u2019t go find or provoke her (MQL), but her heart felt like she ate a catalysis which constantly expanded and attributed all the problems to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Inside the palace, Jing De reported what happened at Nan Lin wangfu to Wanyan Lie. After hearing that Feng Cang had knelt on one knee and proposed to Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Lie was startled. \u201cIt seemed that this time, his heart has truly moved\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, ah! With Feng Cang\u2019s proud personality, he would certainly not do something like this in public. Your majesty, Nan Lin wang took princess Zhao Yang as the meat of his heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wanyan Lie revealed a cruel smile, \u201cThis is great! Zhen4 wants to cut off the meat from his heart, making him be so in pain as to not want to live anymore! Hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>At night, Su Mei and Su Yue retreated. They left the space for Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang, the two lovers who\u2019d just said their vows.</p><br/><p>Inside the room, they were surrounded by the fragrance of flowers. Murong Qi Qi nestled in Feng Cang\u2019s arms. Her fingers were wrapped around Feng Cang\u2019s hair. She lazily narrowed her eyes like an idle cat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first time I married; that night, the disease suddenly acted. In the end, the other party was scared to death\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second time, the other party inadvertently saw my purple eyes. She screamed and was killed by Ruyi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third time, the other party had heard about my bad reputation of cursing my wives to death. She wanted to escape. In the end, she fell from the wall and broke her neck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fourth time, the sedan hadn\u2019t arrived yet when she cut her wrist\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fifth one entered and wanted to seduce me. She burned aphrodisiac incense in the chamber. I killed her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sixth one suddenly died. She was poisoned\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe seventh lost her chasteness before the marriage. She committed suicide\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe eight one heard my footsteps. She was frightened to death\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Feng Cang confess his past; after hearing his experience, Murong Qi Qi turned over and sat in his embrace, \u201cWangye, you have many love affairs, ah! Hearing this, it seems a bit unfair! It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m marrying, but you\u2019ve already married so many times. Just thinking about it makes me feel it\u2019s unfair! Why don\u2019t I also marry eight times? Then we could be considered even.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s hand held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s waist tightly. \u201cYou\u2019re mine! In this whole life, you will get my surname. Aside from me, in this world, there\u2019s no one who would dare to marry you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Murong Qi Qi raised an eyebrow and pretended to be confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause if others want to touch my woman, they need to ask my sword first if it would let them or not!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Feng Cang\u2019s proprietorial declaration, Murong Qi Qi was very happy. She liked Feng Cang\u2019s domineering appearance. His language revealed a strong possessiveness and jealousy, making people happy when listening to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, wangye, this is not right! In the past, you married so many women and I didn\u2019t even get jealous, instead you\u2019re the one who\u2019s feeling wronged?!\u201d Murong Qi Qi pouted. Although she was touched by Feng Cang\u2019s overbearing words, but she still felt a bit unhappy, \u201cJust the thought of you almost becoming the man of another woman and having children with someone else, makes me feel very sullen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang could understand Murong Qi Qi\u2019s jealousy. He pulled Murong Qi Qi in front of him and kissed her forehead, \u201cQing Qing, if I say before you, I didn\u2019t know what love is and in my eyes, women were just a tool to pass down the family, would you be angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter my parents passed away, imperial grandmother was the only one who truly loved me. There were only a few heirs to Feng clan. In my generation, there\u2019s only me. She was worried about Feng clan\u2019s bloodline. So, every time, she decreed marriage on me in the name of love. However, in the end, she wasn\u2019t successful. Instead, it let her become more worried and also more anxious. And finally, it turned into the current situation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, don\u2019t you know how to reject?\u201d The anger in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart still hasn\u2019t fully disappeared. Although those people were now history, but they had been involved with Feng Cang, making her, who\u2019d wanted to be the only one in his heart, become a bit jealous.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, if I reject, then there would be someone else who would be unhappy!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the smile on Feng Cang\u2019s face became very mysterious. It was full of flavor and also with a slight coolness. Murong Qi Qi felt something was wrong from Feng Cang\u2019s tone. Could there be something hidden inside?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first time I married, the gu poison suddenly acted up. That day wasn\u2019t the fifteenth. After that, every night after the bride entered the wangfu and we worshipped the heaven and earth, the gu would act up. As for those women, no matter if they were poisoned or committed suicide or lost their chasteness; it revealed that all of that had been orchestrated by humans\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying, someone killed them and disguised them as accidents? There\u2019s someone who wanted to deliberately taint your reputation?\u201d Murong Qi Qi suddenly came to a realization. She frowned, \u201cWho is it? Why did he/she do it? Could the other party have a hatred as deep as the sea with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang smiled but didn\u2019t answer. Coldness burst out of those black eyes behind the thick eyelashes. His hand gently combed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hair, \u201cThe day before yesterday, I went into the palace. The emperor let me eat some dessert and drink some tea. After I left the imperial study, I spit them out onto a handkerchief. After I came back, Jin Mo took a look at it. He said that inside the dessert and tea were drugs to hasten up the acting of the gu poison\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wanyan Lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>This result let Murong Qi Qi be very surprised. Why? Why was it like that? Didn\u2019t Wanyan Lie love Feng Cang the most? This time, they\u2019re getting married; Wanyan Lie had been sending gifts to Nan Lin wangfu every day. Almost all the treasures from the palace had been moved here. Could all of this be a sham?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the fourth time when the bride cut her wrist in the sedan chair, I saw that something was wrong. That woman didn\u2019t commit suicide, she had been murdered! Only at the seventh time, when the bride had lost her chasteness and committed suicide, did I become sure that the one behind these incidents was Wanyan Lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he your biological uncle? Why would he treat you like this? Could all those rumors be false? Everything about Bei Zhou\u2019s emperor favoring Nan Lin wang is fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>The result was too incredible. If what Feng Cang said was the truth, then this truth was too cruel! How could a person be such a hypocrite? At one side, he was kind like a respectable elder. At the other side, he was full of calculations and used such ruthless tactics?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve been investigating what had really happened at Yandang mountain fifteen years ago. The world said Feng Xie was defeated at Murong Tai\u2019s hands. Ah, how could Murong Tai be compared to a character like my father?!\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying that, Feng Cang glanced apologetically once at Murong Qi Qi. He felt that it wasn\u2019t right to talk about Murong Tai like that. Speaking of this, Murong Tai was now his father-in-law.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue, it\u2019s fine!\u201d After finding out from Li Qiu Shui that she\u2019s not Murong Tai\u2019s daughter, Murong Qi Qi felt relieved. Even she herself couldn\u2019t accept such a cold and indifferent person as her father.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, father already had victory in his hands. With father\u2019s tactics of leading the army, not to mention one Murong Tai, even ten couldn\u2019t be compared with father\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, do you mean the reason great general was defeated at Yandang mountain was not because of Murong Tai\u2019s ability, but because he was defeated by his own people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSmart!\u201d Feng Cang tapped on Murong Qi Qi nose, \u201cYou got it at once. Qing Qing is very clever!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi only smiled at Feng Cang\u2019s praise. Now, she wanted to know who betrayed Feng Xie. Who let Feng Cang lose his parents so young? Who had such a big hatred towards Feng Xie, for him/her to be able to do such a thing?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t guess wrong, that person is my dear uncle, Wanyan Lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Murong Qi Qi was completely stunned. If it wasn\u2019t because Feng Cang personally saying this, she wouldn\u2019t have believed any of it. However, this answer was really too shocking.</p><br/><p>If Bei Zhou had won that battle at Yandang mountain, Bei Zhou would\u2019ve driven straight into Xi Qi and Xi Qi would\u2019ve become history. Wanyan would\u2019ve become the noblest surname of that territory. The great mountains and rivers would\u2019ve become Bei Zhou\u2019s. If it was truly like what Feng Cang said; then why did Wanyan Lie do this? Him doing this; wasn\u2019t it the same as breaking his ambition of uniting the four seas?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason? Why did he do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi recovered her calmness from the shock of just now. She believed Feng Cang. However, what\u2019s the reason behind this? What kind of reason let Wanyan Lie give up the great benefits and break one of his arms (meaning FX was one of his arms)? Feng Xie was his childhood friend. The two grew up together and their friendship was unbreakable like iron. Moreover, Feng Xie was his brother-in-law and also the soul of Bei Zhou\u2019s army; why did Wanyan Lie want to destroy Feng Xie?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t because my disease acted up every wedding night; if it wasn\u2019t because those innocent women died at the right time and let me find some clues, I wouldn\u2019t have suspected Wanyan Lie at all. I also want to know the answer why he did it. My mother was his most beloved little sister. My father was his best friend. What let him use such a ruthless hand? Till now, I didn\u2019t get the secret behind this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just the thought of the tragic deaths of Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue and also that baby who hadn\u2019t been born yet, Feng Cang would clench his fists. He wished he could grab Wanyan Lie and torture him for answers!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, did you investigate Murong Tai? If it truly was Wanyan Lie who sold out the military intelligence, Murong Tai should know. Besides, this thing was done by Murong Tai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find anything. When Nalan Xin was teaching you at Murong fu5, he used the opportunity to search through the entire Murong fu. He even went to Murong Tai\u2019s basement, but he couldn\u2019t find any answers. It was like every trace had been wiped out, as if it had never happened. Perhaps, Murong Tai was just the sword and the handle was still in the hand of another person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi felt some heartache for the person in front of her. The truth turned out to be so cruel. In the eyes of outsiders, Feng Cang was at a high position, had the richness and glory and was very prominent; however, how would they know that behind him, there\u2019s this?!</p><br/><p>As if he read Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mind, Feng Cang once again pulled Murong Qi Qi into his embrace. His head buried in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, originally, these were my problems. I blame myself very much for bringing you into this whirlpool. It\u2019s just, you\u2019re so beautiful, I couldn\u2019t bear to let you go. I was afraid that after I handled all these matters, you would\u2019ve already become someone else\u2019s wife. With my possessiveness towards you, I would\u2019ve definitely used every way to get you back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi turned her hands and hugged Feng Cang. This man, she really didn\u2019t know what she should say, \u201cWangye, you and I are husband and wife now. The husband has difficulties; as the wife, I should be at your side and help you solve the problems. Wangye is the most important person to me in this world. Now, you\u2019re saying such things, is it that you want to separate our feelings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Feng Cang\u2019s voice tremble slightly. \u201cSometimes, I feel that I\u2019m selfish. Since the moment I lay eyes on you, I wanted to monopolize you and let you become a private thing of mine. After all, in this world, there are very little things that could grab my attention and let me become fond of it. But\u2026my world is too complicated. I\u2019m very selfish for letting you face it with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words finally made Murong Qi Qi understand why his eyes always showed a trace of melancholy. So, it\u2019s because he\u2019d been carrying a blood hatred. That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t be happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d Murong held Feng Cang\u2019s hand and firmly looked at him. \u201cWangye, no matter when or where, no matter what happens, even if it\u2019s mounting a knife mountain or diving into a sea of fire, I would accompany you! I am satisfied and pleased to be beside you. It\u2019s my voluntariness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already pledged undying love. Great general is my father. Princess Ming Yue is my mother. The revenge for the parents is bigger than the sky! We must avenge this revenge! We must not let them die with hatred!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi said it like chopping the nail and slicing the iron and she sounded extremely heroic. Feng Cang seemed to have seen the lofty and proud woman singing under the moonlight. He was about to say something, when a sound came from outside the window.</p><br/><p>Chopping the nail and slicing the iron: resolute and decisive</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi took action at the same time. The two kicked open the window. They discovered one person standing on the wall. That person wore a doll mask. Murong Qi Qi was surprised, \u201cIt\u2019s him! Wangye, the person at the hot spring that night was him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Actions were faster than words. A white figure flew to the person in black. Feng Cang was already next to the person in black. In just a moment, the two had already exchanged a dozen strokes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, he wants to escape!\u201d Murong Qi Qi jumped and wanted to give a helping hand, but unexpectedly, the other party threw something that gave out smoke. After the smoke cleared, there was no trace of the other party.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

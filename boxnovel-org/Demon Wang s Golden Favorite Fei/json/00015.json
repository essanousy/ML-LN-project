Her eyes filled with a layer of water.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe rushed over herself, I don\u2019t know why it become like this\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened just now, everyone understood clearly. When Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s sword whooshed over, Murong Qi Qi actually didn\u2019t do anything, but why did it become Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s wrist being cut by a dagger? Have to say that this was to succeed by mistake. It could only be said that this Murong Qi Qi is really lucky!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just, was that really only luck? In Li Yun Qing\u2019s eyes rose a touch of interest. It seems that this little cousin sister was like a huge treasure. The closer you get, the more surprised you\u2019ll be.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, what happened just now, we saw it clearly. It has nothing to do with you. It was just an accident!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi scared like that, Shangguan Wu Ji quickly opened his mouth to appease her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, even if they investigate it, I\u2019ll testify for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Shangguan, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird little sister, drink a cup of wine to calm your nerves!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian poured wine and handed it over to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were looking; it was not your fault. You don\u2019t need to worry too much. Daddy is also a reasonable person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, second big sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi took over the glass of wine and brought it to her mouth. The moment it went into her mouth, she discovered the problem.</p><br/><p>Ah, she (MXL) actually put drug inside! She (MQQ) knew that today won\u2019t end so easily. She (MQQ) waited for so long, Murong Xin Lian finally couldn\u2019t wait anymore and took action. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s thick lashed flashed slightly and calmly drank the wine.</p><br/><p>She has been thrown in the poison spring by godfather to soak for two years. She was simply immune to it such child\u2019s play. But since Murong Xin Lian was determined to trap her, why not beat her at her own game?!</p><br/><p>Not long after, Murong Qi Qi pressed her head with an appearance of having headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel a bit unwell. You continue to play. I\u2019ll go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like this, Murong Xin Lian knows that the drug has taken action. She restrained the delight in her heart and put on a worried look.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t your maid come with you? I\u2019ll let someone escort you! Ma Nao, bring third miss back to Cui Zhu yuan1!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>A pretty girl immediately appeared in front of Murong Qi Qi and supported her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi retracted her hand. Murong Xin Lian paled. Could it be that she discovered something?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have some things I didn\u2019t take!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi walked to the table and put everyone\u2019s bet in her embrace. Then she picked up \u2018Xue Fu pill\u2019 and handed it to Shangguan Wu Ji.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met young master, but young master protected me. Take this Xue Fu pill as my thanks. Asking young master Shangguan to please take it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Shangguan Wu Ji to reject, Murong Qi Qi stuffed the Xue Fu pill in his hands. Then she bowed gracefully at Bai Mu Fei and Bai Yi Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour kindness, Qi Qi will pay this gratitude in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once these are done, Murong Qi Qi once again pressed her temples and made an expression of pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Nao, bring me back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi left with Ma Nao, Murong Xin Lian let out a sigh of relief. Her expression also softened.</p><br/><p>Just now, Murong Jun had eaten something bad. He already went back. The things were going according to her expectations. In a moment, the drug on Murong Jun will take action. As long as Ma Nao led Murong Qi Qi to Murong Jun, firewood would encounter fire and would immediately burn.</p><br/><p>At this side Ma Nao was supporting the dizzy Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, third miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Calling twice and didn\u2019t see Murong Qi Qi respond, Ma Nao went according to the plan. She supported Murong Qi Qi to a room and left in a hurry.</p><br/><p>After Ma Nao left, Murong Qi Qi opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you found out?\u201d</p><br/><p>She swept away her demeanor of just now. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes gleamed in the dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei whispered some words in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ears. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s smile became wider and wider. Sure enough, dogs who bite people don\u2019t bark. Murong Xin Lian was such a person. She wanted to destroy her reputation. She could even do such a wicked thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate already brought concubine Zheng here. Miss, do you want to move and left the bed for her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue appeared at the door. Sure enough on her back she is carrying a woman.</p><br/><p>After Su Mei and Su Yue put down Zheng Min, the three left. Not long after they have left, Ma Nao walked in the room while supporting another person.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hot! Really hot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun torn his clothes and climbed in the bed. Then he touched a soft body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, this is second miss\u2019s gift for you. Enjoy it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Nao dropped the curtain for the two, sneered and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcitement will soon be played!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi smiled. If she hadn\u2019t guessed wrong, not long after, Murong Xin Lian will bring people to catch \u2018a couple in act\u2019. If this matter was spread out, not only would she not be able to live, she was afraid that even Murong Jun will be destroyed by this.</p><br/><p>At the pavilion, after Murong Xin Lin saw Ma Nao did her heart finally calmed down. The smile on her mouth became wider and wider.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister, is there something that needs to be happy about, that you are so happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian felt Murong Xin Lian\u2019s strangeness and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian quickly denied while shaking her head. She quickly covered her guilty conscience. Murong Xin Lian stood up and poured wine for the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday I invited you here. I didn\u2019t know that so many things will happen and ruined everyone\u2019s mood. I\u2019m really sorry. I apologize to everyone with this cup of wine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Xin Lian to drink the wine, rapid footsteps could be heard together with Murong Tai\u2019s angry growl: \u201cWhere\u2019s that unfillial daughter? Murong Qi Qi, roll out here!\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that in just a moment, Duanmu family reported the matter of Murong Qi Qi hurting Duanmu Yi Yi to Murong Tai. The moment he heard that the rubbish of his family had hurt the empress\u2019s niece and the fact that Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s wrist had been broken and it\u2019ll be difficult to put it back together, Murong Tai\u2019s anger was as high as the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Murong Xin Lian saw that Murong Tai has come, her heart became happy.</p><br/><p>Really great! With Murong Tai here, Murong Qi Qi would definitely die today! The Murong Tai who always cared about face, if he saw Murong Qi Qi in act together with her biological big brother, didn\u2019t know if he would or would not kill her on spot!</p><br/><p>Seeing that people of the three great families are still here, Murong Tai\u2019s expression turned for the better, but his heart was still very angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Murong Qi Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird big sister is feeling unwell, she already went back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian immediately reported in a well behaved posture the whereabouts of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! She is feeling unwell? Causing trouble and then pretending to be sick. She still has reasons!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Tai wanted to leave. She knew that he is going to make trouble for Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qing Lian rushed to his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, I\u2019ll go with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching a play, especially watching that rubbish being scolded, to Murong Qing Lian that was her happiest enjoyment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

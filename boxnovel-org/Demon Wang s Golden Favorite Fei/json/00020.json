Bengong 1 has already promised him that I\u2019ll break off the engagement of Jing wang2 and Murong Qi Qi and let him get the beauty. Such a person like him won\u2019t play tricks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking till here, Duanmu Qing suddenly envied Murong Qi Qi. Although she didn\u2019t have talent nor beauty, but there was such a handsome man who had fallen at her feet. The pitiful one was her. Although she was Duanmu family\u2019s eldest miss, is the head of the six palaces, is the empress, but how was the emperor treating her\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The imperial\u2019s grace was fleeting, so she must give birth to a crown prince! The hand in Duanmu Qing\u2019s sleeves clenched into a fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cMi, miss\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue, who was waiting at the door, saw Murong Qi Qi being pulled by a man, her chin almost fell off. Who was this man? He dared to put his hands on miss!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi wantws to pull her hand back, but the other party grabbed it tighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot letting go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian gongzi 3still has a playful expression, but Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t read the mood flashing in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes burned with anger. It had always been her who had everything in her grasp, when did it become that others could meddle in her things? No matter who this man was, she had no interest. If he continued to be like this, then don\u2019t blame her for being ruthless!</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes exuding wild light like a leopard in the forest, the way Lian gongzi looked at her began to become admiration.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the woman wang &gt; had selected! Could it be that the things that had entered wang\u2019s eyes were this arrogance and the rebelliousness in her eyes? However, these were far from enough, enough for you to stay by that man\u2019s side. Murong Qi Qi, I still want to see your ability that made wang give you special treatment\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, you hid it really deep, ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian gongzi\u2019s breath was light and very warm, stroking Murong Qi Qi\u2019s earlobe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to counterattack, a thundering voice came. Looking at the direction, don\u2019t know since when, there were now a few more people led by Jing wang Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>At this time, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s expression was very livid. Standing behind him were Duanmu Hong Chen, Shangguan Wu Ji and Li Yun Qing.</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji heard about the matter of the empress letting Murong Qi Qi search for Lian gongzi, they were worried about her. After finding out that Lian gongzi was at Duanmu residence, the two came and happened to encounter Duanmu Hong Chen inviting Longze Jing Tian over. They had just arrived and saw this scene. From their point of view, it was Lian gongzi who kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, you saw it! She is Murong Qi Qi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Hong Chen\u2019s lips revealed a sarcastic smile. Murong Qi Qi was being so intimate with a man in the open, no man would be able to accept it, let alone Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Hong Chen\u2019s expression made Li Yun Qing understand. He deliberately invited Longze Jing Tian along to watch this scene.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Wu Ji felt really uncomfortable. He felt like he was about to lose something important.</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian glared angrily at this \u2018cheating couple\u2019. Although he didn\u2019t fancy Murong Qi Qi and wanted to break off the engagement, but the other party was still his fianc\u00e9e in name. His fianc\u00e9e was entangled with another man and had been seen by so many people. Where should he, Longze Jing Tian, put his face?!</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, he is talking about us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian gongzi simply pulled Murong Qi Qi into his embrace. His beautiful pair of eyes looked at Longze Jing Tian, full of provocation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he your fianc\u00e9e? I see, he is just so so, how can he compare to the handsome me?! Qi Qi, why don\u2019t you reconsider; kick him out and go with me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian gongzi lifted a wisp of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hair and rolled it around his finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise you, from my head to my toe, I\u2019m clean. Not like him who has long been sullied by the fragrance of those women. You won\u2019t be interested in such a disgusting man\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian gongzi\u2019s action provoked Longze Jing Tian\u2019s anger.</p><br/><p>His things, even if it was a woman he didn\u2019t want, before he had abandoned it, it was definitely not allowed to betray him. Otherwise, it couldn\u2019t be forgiven!</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, today I finally got to know how cheap you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian already knew that the other party was strange doctor Liangongzi. In some aspect, he couldn\u2019t get into his bad side, so he put all the blame on Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright to not have such a slut like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, if you have the ability then write a break of engagement letter, ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi finally understood Lian gongzi\u2019s motive. Seeing him provoke Longze Jing Tian so brazenly, he (Lian) must have come to break her engagement. This was what she, Murong Qi Qi, desired!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi grabbed Lian gongzi\u2019s neck and played with his hair provocatively. The same gesture. Now it was her turn to provoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a man, then quickly help us. A gentleman should have the grace of helping people. If it\u2019s not yours, then don\u2019t use force to get it! Wangye, a fruit got by force is not sweet. Qi Qi\u2019s heart already has someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBenwang 4 forced you? Benwang will force this rubbish? Benwang, I, I\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian nearly vomited blood. How did he become a person who \u2018rob someone in love\u2019, someone who was blocking another\u2019s fate? He was someone who can\u2019t wait to break off the engagement!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, Murong Qi Qi, very good! Don\u2019t regret! Servant, get a brush forbenwang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, don\u2019t be impulsive!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he heard that Longze Jing Tian wanted to write a letter of breaking off the engagement, Shangguan Wu Ji immediately grabbed his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking off an engagement is very damaging to a girl\u2019s reputation! Wangye,think it through, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, your marriage has been decreed by the emperor. If the emperor knew that wangye broke it off in secret, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the other side, Li Yun Qing also verbally stopped Longze Jing Tian and let him calm down. Although he didn\u2019t know why Murong Qi Qi was being like this, but if Longze Jing Tian wrote down the \u2018break off engagement\u2019 letter, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reputation would be gone!</p><br/><p>\u201cLian, you once said that your biggest wish was to let another raise your son. It seems that your wish will be realized soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pulled Lian gongzi\u2019s hand and carefully put it on her belly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, I also feel that the surname Longze is really nice in the ears!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Lian gongzi froze for a moment. Then seeing the slyness flash in her eyes, he smiled. This woman was indeed interesting. She even abandoned the virginity that everyone cared about the most. It seemed that she also couldn\u2019t wait to withdrew from the political marriage. Wang was actually worried that she had a crush on Longze Jing Tian and especially let him make this trip. Now it seemed that it was really unnecessary. She would\u2019ve been able to do all of this\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Murong Qi Qi, you are simply shameless to the extreme!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian, who had been persuaded and got some of his senses back, couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. She hadn\u2019t even married but has already made him wear a green hat. No matter what, he couldn\u2019t have such a woman!</p><br/><p>1. Bengong: this palace, I used by the females of the imperial family</p><br/><p>2. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>3. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer to a famous unmarried man</p><br/><p>4. Benwang: this king, I used by the prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

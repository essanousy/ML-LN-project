Feng Cang coldly looked up at Longze Yu Er. His gaze was like an ice knife.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you talking about? Say it once more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words made the whole place freeze. The icy air emitting from his body made even Longze Yu sitting on the highest seat feel cold. No wonder, at Bei Zhou, there are some who say that they would rather offend the emperor than the demon wang1\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2026 \u2026,\u201d Longze Yu Er stuttered. Don\u2019t know why, but when she met Feng Cang\u2019s pair of eyes full of killing intent, she, who\u2019d always been eloquent, suddenly became someone who didn\u2019t know what to do. Her two rows of teeth were clattering, not because of anger, but because of fear.</p><br/><p>The killing intent from that person was real. And this kind of killing intent was not ordinary, but it was the same experience as on the battle field. Just the hostility alone already made people\u2019s heart feel very cold. To put it plainly, Longze Yu Er was just a princess who was raised in the palace. When had ever she seen a posture like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when the entire Hall of Supreme Harmony had almost become Feng Cang\u2019s icehouse because of Longze Yu Er\u2019s stupidity, Murong Qi Qi spoke softly: \u201cWangye, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>One \u2018I\u2019m hungry\u2019 pressed down Feng Cang\u2019s emotions. Feng Cang put away the coldness from his body. No matter how big of a thing it was, it couldn\u2019t be compared to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, what do you want to eat? I\u2019ll pick it up for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBamboo shoot!\u201d</p><br/><p>bamboo shoots</p><br/><p>bamboo shoots</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pointed at the dish located to the left side of Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the whole atmosphere relaxed. Just a moment ago, it was twenty-seven days after the Winter Solstice. Now, it had returned back to spring. It was a surprise to everyone that Murong Qi Qi had been able to calm down Feng Cang\u2019s emotions. No need to even mention the people of high status. The way they looked at Murong Qi Qi became even more different.</p><br/><p>Twenty-seven days after the Winter Solstice: the coldest day of the year</p><br/><p>Seeing that all of Feng Cang\u2019s attention was focused entirely on Murong Qi Qi, Ming Yue Xin quickly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor uncle, this Xin er2 especially prepared the dance \u2018Tread wave\u2019 for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good, good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu was happy that someone had come forward to warm up the scene. Just now, Longze Yu Er acted really too muddle-headed. She actually dared to say that about Feng Cang. Longze Yu broke into a cold sweat because of this reckless daughter. He was afraid that Feng Cang would let her blood splatter the hall. At this moment, Ming Yue Xin\u2019s willingness to perform, naturally Longze Yu would support it.</p><br/><p>With the play of the music, Ming Yue Xin began to dance. Have to say that her waist was very flexible. Her expression was also in place, expressing a cute girl vividly and also attracting everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian picked up the bottle of wine and looked at the dance. His gaze fell upon that pair of lovers.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s greatness was not part of Longze Jing Tian\u2019s expectations. It really matched the old saying \u2018seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times\u2019. No matter what the rumors were, it\u2019s not as accurate as seeing it in person. Although Longze Jing Tian is an outstanding person among the imperial children, but now compared to Feng Cang, he couldn\u2019t help but admit that he would lose on one point.</p><br/><p>As for Murong Qi Qi, he\u2019s even more surprised. Longze Jing Tian\u2019s mind couldn\u2019t help but think back to the forest when he saw Du Xian Er. Obviously, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s looks are ordinary and he had seen her several times, but in his mind, he still couldn\u2019t help but compare the two. Even Longze Jing Tian himself felt that it\u2019s strange.</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian\u2019s attitude made Murong Xin Lian sitting next to him mistakenly think that he took a fancy at Ming Yue Xin. Looking at the girl vividly dancing, Murong Xue Lian\u2019s palms were full of cold sweats.</p><br/><p>What should she do? What should she do?! If Ming Yue Xin announced that she wants a marriage alliance with Longze Jing Tian, then what should she do? Being stepped on by an official wife who is a princess, even if she gives birth to a son, it will only be a son from the illegitimate line. He simply cannot become someone bigger!</p><br/><p>No! Can\u2019t let Ming Yue Xin enter the fu3! Only she, Murong Xin Lian, can become Jing wangfei4 and only she has the right to become the future empress! Just in a moment, Murong Xin Lian made up her mind. She needs to compete with Ming Yue Xin to see who is better. She can\u2019t let her position be occupied by another!</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ming Yue Cheng was still wearing a purple robe. On the table was his beloved wine gourd. The only difference today was that his hair\u2019s neatly combed with a crown above his head. It\u2019s just on his forehead, there were a few strands of hair, which highlighted the owner\u2019s original character.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng poured wine for himself and drank on his own. He also wasn\u2019t sitting according to etiquette like the others. Instead, he had found a comfortable position and leaned in that position. His gaze steadily stared at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>After not having seen her for a few days, the aura around this girl seemed to have become more powerful. Just now, she was the closest to Feng Cang when he showed hostility, but she not only wasn\u2019t afraid but actually dispersed the hostility with a few floating words. It seems that this girl\u2019s ability is great! Or Feng Cang also knew that she is different\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin did her best to move her waist. From time to time, she would look at Feng Cang. But Feng Cang didn\u2019t seem to have any interest in Ming Yue Xin. He just cared about his little wangfei now. He mustn\u2019t let her go hungry. Finally, he got the interest, put down his status as wangye and began to serve Murong Qi Qi dishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat more, you are too skinny. Having a little more meat is a good feel\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words made Murong Qi Qi almost bite her tongue. Good feel? Does he like the types with more meat?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, no matter how much I eat, I won\u2019t become fat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words, Feng Cang looked at her thoughtfully for a long time before saying: \u201cQing Qing, I heard that after a woman gets married and is in a loving relationship with her husband, they will gain some weight. Why don\u2019t we get married as soon as possible?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi choked. This wangye seemed to not rest if he hasn\u2019t startled people. What loving relationship? His other wives didn\u2019t even live past the wedding night! Could it be the earlier they marry, the earlier she\u2019ll meet her demise and go reincarnate?</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, the direction of your thoughts is wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>After realizing what Murong Qi Qi was thinking, Feng Cang pushed that devilish face forward. That pair of beautiful eyes locked onto Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes. He earnestly said: \u201cQing Qing, I don\u2019t eat people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPu\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. All the food in her mouth sprayed onto Feng Cang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the scattered rice on Feng Cang\u2019s face, Murong Qi Qi laughed embarrassingly. A pair of hands quickly pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his face casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I just couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore\u2026 \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi spray rice on Feng Cang\u2019s face, Longze Yu Er laughed. She\u2019d heard that Feng Cang had an obsession with cleanliness. Murong Qi Qi acting like this, wouldn\u2019t he kill her?</p><br/><p>The eyes that were originally on Ming Yue Xin, were now staring at Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang. In a moment, the atmosphere turned even stranger than before. Many people were mourning for the unlucky Murong Qi Qi. Provoking demon wang, hope she makes the best of it!</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t seem to have noticed the strange atmosphere. Instead, he was enjoying Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018serve\u2019. Her hands are really soft and there\u2019s also a faint fragrance on them. This fragrance is different from the women\u2019s smell powder, but instead it has a natural sweetness, a kind of green apple flavor.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, it\u2019s apple! Thinking till here, Feng Cang moved his gaze to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s not thin nor thick pair of red lips. Don\u2019t know if the taste there also has the smell of apples! Sentimental with a slight sweetness\u2026\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

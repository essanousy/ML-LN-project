The three read it over once. Since there weren\u2019t any questions, they put down their fingerprints.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the imperial garden!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the bet of the three princesses, it became crowded inside the imperial garden. Aside from those high level officials and their wives who were in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the aristocratic and officials\u2019 families who were waiting outside also came over. Everyone wanted to see this competition.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi once again, Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji were shocked. Normally, she was dressed very plainly; now that she had dressed up, she didn\u2019t lose to others. When they saw Feng Cang next to Murong Qi Qi, they were even more surprised. So Nan Lin wang1 turned out to be such a beautiful person!</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s appearance once again caused a small sensation. All those bad rumors about him was crushed by that devilishly beautiful face of his. In particular, the hearts of those misses were greatly moved. When they saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s clothes and crown, they all became envious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! Is she Murong Qi Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi prodded Murong Qing Lian and found that the other party had lost her mind on Feng Cang\u2019s beauty.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi had already seen Feng Cang. He is indeed a stunning man, but Duanmu Yi Yi felt such a devilishly beautiful man is too unreal. In comparison, she prefers Longze Jing Tian more.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi already knew that Ming Yue Xin had come to form a marriage alliance. Now, Ming Yue Xin is competing with Murong Qi Qi. Although Duanmu Yi Yi doesn\u2019t like Murong Qi Qi, but she still hopes that Murong Qi Qi will win. After all, if Murong Qi Qi wins, Ming Yue Xin will lose face. In Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s eyes, that is a happy thing.</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian\u2019s eyes never left Feng Cang since the moment he appeared. Heavens, since the moment she was born until now, she actually didn\u2019t know that in this world, there\u2019s such a man. He really is the favorite of the heaven and earth\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>After the bet agreement was made public, the content caused an uproar. It\u2019s known in the capital that Murong Qi Qi is a rubbish. Even if she had recently made two songs, but it still can\u2019t change her identity as a rubbish. On the surface, this didn\u2019t seem to be a bet in favor of Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Bai Yi Yue\u2019s side stood Bai Mu Fei. The brother is handsome, the sister fresh and pure. They looked very outstanding in the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei smiled, this third miss Murong had brought them too many miracles. Presumably, today there will also be a miracle!</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet that princess Zhao Yang will win!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei was so sure, Bai Yi Yue also smiled: \u201cI think the same as big brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>But this was only the Bai sibling thoughts. In most people\u2019s eyes, Murong Qi Qi will definitely lose. No! She is dead! After she loses, Ming Yue Xin will take her life. So losing is dying. Dying is also losing.</p><br/><p>The platform where the painting competition would take place was built in a moment. Three people, three places where they would not disturb each other. The time is one incense stick. Incense has been lit. Paint of good quality was brought out for the three people by palace servants.</p><br/><p>When they reached Murong Qi Qi, just as the palace maid was about to hand over the paint, she had a slip of hand. The porcelain box fell on the ground, breaking into pieces. The paint inside scattered all over the ground. With a gust of wind, those powdered colors flew away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, how can you be so careless?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s voice, which sounded like she\u2019s rejoicing from other\u2019s misfortune, sounded at the back of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do now? Without paint, how can you paint, ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsking princess for forgiveness! This slave didn\u2019t do it on purpose! This slave didn\u2019t do it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the palace maid knelt down in front of Murong Qi Qi and her mouth kept saying \u2018asking princess for forgiveness\u2019, but the tone of her voice didn\u2019t show any guilt. It seemed that it had some happiness and the feeling of success in it. It seemed that this palace maid definitely did it on purpose and she must\u2019ve been ordered by someone.</p><br/><p>Such a person, she would definitely calculate with her in a moment. Murong Qi Qi rolled the paper open. She leisurely started grinding.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, continue kneeling\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, she thought that without paint, Murong Qi Qi would surely become frantic or directly admit defeat, but all this time, she was calm as if nothing had affected her mood. Instead, it let people admire this princess Zhao Yang\u2019s tolerance.</p><br/><p>The wind was blowing slowly. The incense had already burned down to half.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin and Longze Yu Er have long began to paint, only Murong Qi Qi was still grinding. She seemed like she wasn\u2019t worried, making the onlookers couldn\u2019t help but pinch a cold sweat for her!</p><br/><p>At this time, Longze Jing Tian couldn\u2019t sit still anymore. What\u2019s the matter with Murong Qi Qi? Just now, she had the look that she would win; so why is she indifferent now? Could it be that she gave up? Or is it that she really didn\u2019t want to be Nan Lin wangfei2? If it\u2019s like that, then after she loses and Ming Yue Xin is making trouble for her, he must come forward to protect her!</p><br/><p>Compared to Longze Jing Tian, Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s expression seemed more at ease, but in his heart, he was really worried. He didn\u2019t know what Murong Qi Qi wanted to do. Although he\u2019s very willing to believe that Murong Qi Qi would win, but towards this imperial little sister Ming Yue Xin\u2019s capabilities, Ming Yue Cheng is more or less clear about. If in the end, Murong Qi Qi really lost, what method should he use to protect her?</p><br/><p>The only person who didn\u2019t change was Feng Cang. This wangye seemed assured of success. His expression was calm as always. He sipped tea with an expression that showed he was not worried. And his calm demeanor looked more tempting, making Murong Qing Lian blush.</p><br/><p>Why did Murong Qi Qi this rubbish had to meet such a man? If she had known it\u2019ll be like this, then she should\u2019ve taken the initiative and pleaded. Even if it\u2019s chongxi3!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, get up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, just when everyone almost lost their patience with waiting, Murong Qi Qi commanded with her fingers at the palace maid who had just broken the porcelain box to let her come over.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s innocent looking face, the palace maid glanced at the person high up. That person nodded at her. Only then did the palace maid slowly stand up and walked to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, what matter do you have by looking for this slave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou destroyed bengong\u2019s4 paint, of course you need to lend some color to help bengong finish this painting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis slave didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Princess, what do you want this slave to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she\u2019s claiming that she didn\u2019t do it on purpose, but on the palace maid\u2019s face, there\u2019s written \u2018deliberately did it\u2019.</p><br/><p>And the eyes of the palace maid betrayed her inner thoughts. The one she looked at was precisely the empress who got pregnant because of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s help\u2026 \u2026Duanmu Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy. Come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the other party moved her head over, Murong Qi Qi grabbed the palace maid\u2019s hair. She poured all the ink in palace maid\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for people to understand the situation, Murong Qi Qi slapped the palace maid twice on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cPu\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The palace maid felt pain. She opened her mouth. The black ink sprayed like rain on the paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice just fell, in her hand there\u2019s suddenly a shiny dagger. The palace maid didn\u2019t have time to struggle. On her white neck, there\u2019s a trace of blood. The next moment, blood gushed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The palace maid felt pain. She struggled while screaming. But unfortunately, her hair was held by Murong Qi Qi. She couldn\u2019t break out. Looking once more, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s right hand has a brush now. She mixed the blood with the ink and began to paint quickly on the paper.</p><br/><p>TL Note: I don\u2019t understand why they just don\u2019t go get another set of paint. It\u2019s almost impossible for the palace to only have three boxes of paint. </p><br/><p>Wanng/ wangye: prince of the first rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wangfei: main wife of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Chongxi: Chongxi: arrange a wedding for a very ill young man with the hope that the \u2019event of great joy\u2019 will drive away his bad luck and hasten his recovery, what does it matter?! To be able to be with such a man, even if in the next moment she\u2019d die, she\u2019ll still be happy \u21a9</p><br/><p>Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family</p><br/>\n</div>"}

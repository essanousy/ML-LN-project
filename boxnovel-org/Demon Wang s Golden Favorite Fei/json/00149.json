Unable to tear her eyes away, she stared at the entrance of the hall. She wanted to know what Feng Cang looked like now.</p><br/><p>The sunlight sprinkled inside from the entrance and covered the hall with a layer of golden light.</p><br/><p>Inside the golden light, a pair of heavenly people moved closer and closer. The man was dressed in a graceful white. His appearance was like a painting. The girl was in warm red and smiled like a flower.</p><br/><p>\u2018Boom, boom, boom\u2026\u2019 Seeing Feng Cang once again, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s heart started beating very fast. It\u2019s him! It\u2019s really him! Xia Yun Xi was so excited that tears almost came out. After so many years, he had become mature. From an elegant young master, he\u2019d turned into a devilishly beautiful man. However, his facial features remained the same. Although he looked a lot colder, but it let him gain a layer of masculinity.</p><br/><p>Ten years, ah! Xia Yun Xi bit her lips and forced her tears back. The man she\u2019d loved for ten years has finally appeared.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s expression was no better than Xia Yun Xi\u2019s. When he saw the appearance of Murong Qi Qi, Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s hand trembled once. A bit of the wine in the cup spilled onto the table.</p><br/><p>She is actually him? Only today, did Ming Yue Cheng realise that Murong Qi Qi was also Guanghua gongzi;1 the person who\u2019d come to find him, partnered with him in order to win Nan Feng\u2019s throne.</p><br/><p>After getting the throne, Ming Yue Cheng had contacted the people of Jue Se Fang many times, wanting to see Guanghua gongzi and to show him his gratitude in person. However, the shopkeeper of Jue Se Fang said that gongzi wasn\u2019t in Nan Feng and that gongzi was very busy. Now, Ming Yue Cheng finally understood what exactly Guanghua gongzi was busy with.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng couldn\u2019t describe his inner thoughts. All the complex feelings poured into his heart. This woman had deceived him so bitterly! He\u2019d searched everywhere for Guanghua gongzi, wanting to express his gratitude. However, this woman went to Bei Zhou and experienced so many things.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t come personally this time, then perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have known the truth.</p><br/><p>No wonder he\u2019d felt that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes were beautiful and also wondered why someone with such beautiful eyes could look so ordinary. Now, he finally understood. This girl used an ordinary face mask and deceived everyone. It was just, her ordinary face already made people mesmerized. Now that she\u2019d changed into a heavenly appearance; presumably, even more people would fall for her!</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle!\u201d Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi bowed at the same time to Wanyan Lie. Just now, when the two had entered together, Wanyan Lie lost his soul for a moment. They\u2019re really a match! If these two people really could be together, how great would that be?!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie let the person in black continue to \u2018monitor\u2019 Long Autumn palace. After knowing that Feng Cang had slept every night at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s, Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart finally felt at ease. Before, he was worried that these siblings would put down this relationship because of their blood ties. Now, it seemed that, compared to them, he was the coward. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t get happiness\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all here. Take your place!\u201d</p><br/><p>The banquet began. Songs and dance came up. Delicious food was also placed in front of everyone by the palace maids.</p><br/><p>After Ming Yue Cheng looked at Murong Qi Qi, he couldn\u2019t help but look at the man at her side. Don\u2019t know why, Ming Yue Cheng had an intuition. He discovered that Murong Qi Qi treated Feng Cang differently compared to the others. At least, the feelings in their eyes weren\u2019t as simple as that of siblings.</p><br/><p>The moment he looked at Feng Cang, Ming Yue Cheng frowned. This man has a problem!</p><br/><p>Before, between the eyebrows of Wanyan Lie, Ming Yue Cheng had seen that there\u2019s a gu in his body. At this time, on Feng Cang\u2019s face, he saw that same situation once again. Between Feng Cang\u2019s eyebrows, there was a touch of back. Ordinary people couldn\u2019t see this touch of black. It\u2019s just, Ming Yue Cheng had been contact with gu ever since he\u2019s young. That\u2019s why he had a deep understanding of gu.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s color was a light black. Feng Cang\u2019s color was completely black. It seemed that Feng Cang had the gu for many years.</p><br/><p>Although Feng Cang looked no different from an ordinary person, but it couldn\u2019t change the fact that he carried the gu for many years. The poison of the gu was already pure black. If the gu was still not taken out, then if the gu acted on the person who\u2019d manipulated the gu, Feng Cang would stop breathing and die.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just, why would Feng Cang be infected with the gu? This question had been bothering Ming Yue Cheng.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s birth mother Miao Chu Yun was an expert at gu and was also a member of Tibetan tribe. However, Miao Chu Yun also once told him, if there\u2019s no hatred, members of Tibetan tribe wouldn\u2019t have put gu in ordinary people because gu was an organism that\u2019s difficult to manipulate. If the gu wasn\u2019t manipulated well, it might bite back at the person who used the gu. Besides, using gu to harm a human life was a very negative thing. So, the person who put the gu in someone else would also not have a long life.</p><br/><p>The Tibetan people had been living at the south of Nan Feng. They lived in a tribal form. Under normal circumstances, the Tibetan people wouldn\u2019t leave their homeland. So where did the gu on Feng Cang and Wanyan Lie came from? Who had such a big gut to put gu on Bei Zhou\u2019s emperor and Nan Lin wang? What motive did the person who used the gu had?</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng frowned. His gaze had been on Feng Cang, making Murong Qi Qi sense something strange. She looked around carefully, and discovered that Ming Yue Cheng was indeed staring at Feng Cang. Besides, he was staring at the area between the eyebrows. Could it be that there was something between Feng Cang\u2019s eyebrows? Murong Qi Qi turned her head and also looked at the area between Feng Cang\u2019s eyebrows.</p><br/><p>There was a touch of black. Murong Qi Qi knew that this was the performance of gu. It\u2019s just, why would Ming Yue Cheng stare at that area? Could it be that he knew something? Speaking of this, in this continent, the people who knew how to use gu were all in Nan Feng. Was it that Ming Yue Cheng had a way to lift the gu?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s attention moved between Ming Yue Cheng and Feng Cang. If it wasn\u2019t because they were at a palace banquet, she would certainly have gone to see Ming Yue Cheng personally and ask him about the situation clearly. If Ming Yue Cheng truly had a way to remove the gu poison on Feng Cang\u2019s body, then it would be very great!</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Qing Qing is comparing me and Ming Yue Cheng to see who is better?\u201d Seeing Murong Qi Qi look at Ming Yue Cheng, Feng Cang was a bit jealous. If this wasn\u2019t a public occasion; if in front of everyone, they weren\u2019t siblings, then he would\u2019ve put his hand on her waist and interrogate why she was looking at Ming Yue Cheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you\u2026,\u201d Hearing the strong jealousy in Feng Cang\u2019s words, Murong Qi Qi chuckled. Her small hand pulled Feng Cang\u2019s sleeve under the table, \u201cObviously, it was Ming Yue Cheng who had been staring at you, making me jealous. Now, you turned it over to me! Quickly confess, what kind of relationship is there between you and Ming Yue Cheng which shouldn\u2019t be known to the public? Why was he looking at you? Besides, it was gazing at the area between your eyebrows?</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi said this, Feng Cang immediately understood her meaning. Ming Yue Cheng could see that there was gu poison in his body. Could it be that he had a way to cure it? It\u2019s just, when he thought that Ming Yue Cheng had come this time to ask for Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand, Feng Cang\u2019s expression sank.</p><br/><p>If Ming Yue Cheng decided to use the cure of the gu poison as an exchange to get Murong Qi Qi, he wouldn\u2019t agree.</p><br/><p>How could Murong Qi Qi not know what Feng Cang was thinking? This man, ah, really eating vinegar incessantly! Could it be that she\u2019s like the popular apricot? \u201cI\u2019ve met Ming Yue Cheng before. He\u2019s not a nasty person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi spoke for Ming Yue Cheng. Feng Cang got another burst of jealousy, \u201cQing Qing, you actually have contact with Ming Yue Cheng. Why don\u2019t I know?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang pout like a child, Murong Qi Qi smiled, \u201cCang, could it be that you don\u2019t know the matter of Guanghua gongzi and Ming Yue Cheng partnering up? Otherwise, how could I\u2019ve have gotten the special access of Nan four states!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it was like that!\u201d Feng Cang nodded. Moyu occupied the four Nan states. Murong Qi Qi was Guanghua gongzi. He immediately understood after pulling strings together. This woman, ah! She inadvertently overturned the regime of Nan Feng. He didn\u2019t even know what to say about her!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I\u2019ll give you the special access of Bei four states. You and Ming Yue Cheng break off your contact, alright?\u201d Feng Cang began to retreat by advancing. Under the table, he grabbed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand. His fingertips made circles on her palm, \u201cYou see, the territory of Bei four states is also very big. No matter what you do, I\u2019ll support you. Don\u2019t come in contact with him anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, are you jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wants to marry you and let you become Nan Feng\u2019s empress. How could I not be jealous?! Qing Qing, he isn\u2019t better than me, really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang acting spoiled made Murong Qi Qi want to pinch his face. However, in public, she needed to maintain her image. \u201cYou, ah, can be hundred twenty percent at ease! I don\u2019t have anything with Ming Yue Cheng! Besides, Ming Yue Cheng is a gentleman. When I make things clear to him, he would give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s interaction fell into the eyes of Xia Yun Xi. This was an irony.</p><br/><p>No wonder Feng Cang dodged her at every turn. It seems that feelings have developed between these siblings!</p><br/><p>Originally, Murong Qi Qi was a princess who\u2019d come for a marriage alliance and it was Feng Cang who personally went to fetch her. Perhaps these two people had already bred fondness out of familiarity. Later, because of their relation as siblings, they had been forced to separate. However, the feelings were still there. So, despite the ethical code, they\u2019ve maintained an amorous relationship! Really shameless!</p><br/><p>Naturally, the one Xia Yun Xi scolded was Murong Qi Qi. Of course, she wouldn\u2019t admonish Feng Cang. In Xia Yun Xi\u2019s heart, everything about Feng Cang was great. Therefore, the problem definitely lied with Murong Qi Qi. It was this woman who\u2019d seduced Feng Cang, regardless of shame. Really hateful!</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi finally found out the reason why Feng Cang was cold to her. After knowing the reason, she thought about how to take the appropriate steps to shift Feng Cang\u2019s attention from Murong Qi Qi to her. She didn\u2019t want to lose to Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi was thinking about how to deal with Murong Qi Qi. Wanyan Yi was also thinking about Murong Qi Qi. Yesterday, he had discussed again and again with Lin Ke Xin. The two felt that uncooked rice turned to cooked rice was the best method. This was the most secure way. He couldn\u2019t afford to lose. So, even if he needed to use underhanded ways, he must also win!</p><br/><p>The songs and dance came one after another. The atmosphere of the place turned livelier. Wanyan Lie ruled the country a bit slack. That\u2019s why the officials did not act so cautiously. Now, they had begun to eat big mouthfuls of meat and drunk big glasses of wine. There were people who\u2019d boxed with the wine and also people who\u2019d gotten up to toast with each other.</p><br/><p>The scene turned even more vibrant. Seeing this, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s eyes lit up. This was an opportunity! As Xia Yun Xi was thinking, her hand touched the hairpin on her head. Taking advantage of when others didn\u2019t pay her any attention, Xia Yun Xi took down the hairpin. She turned the pearl and quickly poured the powder in her own jar of wine. Then, she turned the hairpin back to its original form and inserted it in her hair.</p><br/><p>Had to say, Xia Yun Xi and Wanyan Yi were a perfect match. She intended to take advantage of this golden opportunity. Wanyan Yi was also thinking like this! However, he had hidden the drug in the long nails of his little finger on the right hand. Wanyan Yi\u2019s little finger just gently knocked on the edge of the jar. This powder went into the jar and became one with the wine.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi and Wanyan Yi almost got up at the same time. They came together to Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang. Seeing the two suddenly appeared dark clouds, Murong Qi Qi raised her head. With one look, she saw two people she disliked the most. The two had appeared at the same time as if they\u2019d agreed on it. Really connected on a deep level with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle cousin sister, don\u2019t know if I have this honor to treat you to a cup of wine!\u201d Wanyan Yi raised the jar in his hand and made a gesture of invitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye,2 can I treat you to a cup of wine?\u201d At a side, Xia Yun Xi also said the same.</p><br/><p>Really a match, ah! Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang exchanged a glance. With one look, you would know that the appearance of these two wouldn\u2019t bear anything good. It was just, in front of everyone, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t object. They stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I will pour wine for you.\u201d Seeing Feng Cang being so willing, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s beautiful eyes betrayed her inner thoughts. She picked up Feng Cang\u2019s cup and slowly poured a cup of wine. When she smelled the fragrance of the wine that\u2019d drifted over, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face turned cold.</p><br/><p>Shameless to the extreme! In this world, there was actually such a shameless woman. Putting drugs in the wine to seduce men. Really shameless! Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand pulled Feng Cang\u2019s sleeve slightly and gave him a reminder.</p><br/><p>How could Feng Cang not know Murong Qi Qi? They had being getting along well for a long time now. Every move and gaze of hers, he knew what they meant. Now, Murong Qi Qi pulling at his sleeve after Xia Yun Xi had poured wine for him. It was obviously telling him that there was a problem with this wine!</p><br/><p>At this side, Wanyan Yi also poured wine for Murong Qi Qi. After seeing the wine Wanyan Yi had poured, Murong Qi Qi sneered. This pair of woman and man were both as cheap! One wanted to drug Feng Cang; the other wanted to drug her. They calculated very well, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle cousin sister, please!\u201d Wanyan Yi used his best smile to face Murong Qi Qi. As long as this matter was successful, he would be Bei Zhou\u2019s crown prince. This world would be his!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi laughed softly. Her eyes had been staring at Wanyan Yi\u2019s eyes, \u201cCousin brother, thank you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These sentences were said floatingly and slowly as if it had magic. When facing with Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Yi had a sense of being absent-minded. In a moment, his mind went blank and he didn\u2019t know what to think anymore. By the time Wanyan Yi woke up, Murong Qi Qi had already drunk the wine and showed him the empty cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, it\u2019s your turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good! I\u2019ll drink!\u201d Wanyan Yi raised his head. A cup of wine went into his stomach. Looking at the wine on his mouth, the corners of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mouth went up.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had drunk the wine. Xia Yun Xi also looked at Feng Cang eagerly, \u201cWangye, I\u2019ve always admired you. This cup of wine is my respect to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s meaning was very obvious. Feng Cang must drink this wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, you being like this is unfriendly. You only treated bengong\u2019s3 big brother and didn\u2019t treat bengong. Could it be that you look down on bengong?\u201d Murong Qi Qi came over. Her eyes were smiling while she looked at Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know why, but when facing Murong Qi Qi, Xia Yun Xi felt that her heart was beating twice as fast. When she drew closer, Murong Qi Qi laughed, \u201cPrincess Yun, bengong was joking with you! I won\u2019t bother you (two) anymore! You drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she looked again, Feng Cang had already poured the wine into his mouth. Seeing Feng Cang drink the wine she\u2019d poured, Xia Yun Xi felt that happiness was waving at her. Everything had gone according to her plan. It seemed that heaven was helping her.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Yi and Xia Yun Xi were both immersed in their own thoughts and went back to their seats. Xia Yun Xi was very happy. She planned to escort Feng Cang out when the drug flared up in Feng Cang\u2019s body. Then\u2026hey, hey, when the matter is done, she would be Nan Lin wangfei.4</p><br/><p>Thinking a bit differently from Xia Yun Xi, although Wanyan Yi felt that he was one step closer to victory, but after seeing Xia Yun Xi toast Feng Cang just now, he keenly sensed the strangeness in this woman. The thought that Xia Yun Xi might have used the same method as him to deal with Feng Cang, made a knot swell in his heart.</p><br/><p>1. Gongzi: young master </p><br/><p>2.

Even tigers would doze off, let alone humans! Anyway, there was ample of time. Now, Feng Cang hasn\u2019t arrived yet. It was useless even if she was impatient.</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian naturally knew what Taji Guli was thinking. To him, Taji Guli was a hot-blooded (reckless) woman . With a bit of instigation, she would change a single spark into a prairie fire. This was typical of a woman who has the beauty but not the brains. Aside from her tenacity, it seemed that she didn\u2019t have any other good points. Even that tenacious and unyielding character had become a bull\u2019s horn. An obstinate and stubborn woman was really not cute at all!</p><br/><p>Bull\u2019s horn: to waste time on an insoluble or insignificant problem</p><br/><p>Looking at Taji Guli, Longze Jing Tian thought of Feng Qi Qi. That crafty woman was a thousand, ten thousand times better than the woman in front of him. They\u2019re both women, why was the difference so big? If it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t have enough power now and needed to \u2018form an alliance\u2019 with Taji Guli, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen such a stupid partner.</p><br/><p>However, with such a person here, he could use her as a gun. Anyway, his goal was Feng Qi Qi. As long as he could get Feng Qi Qi, he was willing to do anything.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi who was far away on the road sneezed two times at this time. She rubbed her itchy nose. \u201cWho is thinking about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, didn\u2019t you say in the past that sneezing once was that someone was thinking about you; sneezing twice was that someone was scolding you?\u201d While Su Mei was sewing shoes in the form of tiger heads for Feng Xiao, she looked at Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, ah! What I said was for ordinary people. In my case, sneezing once is that one person was thinking about me. Sneezing twice is that two people were thinking about me\u2026and so on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words made Su Mei shook her head. She lowered her head and continue to do needlework.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi was not good at things like needlework and embroidery. She hadn\u2019t received such training and also didn\u2019t learn these from young like the women of this era. Therefore, Feng Xiao\u2019s clothes and shoes were designed by her and made by hand by Su Mei and Su Yue.</p><br/><p>On the way, Feng Qi Qi asked Ming Yue Cheng to find a carpenter to make a baby cradle. At this time, Feng Xiao was sleeping in the cradle. Feng Qi Qi sung a lullaby. Because Gu Yun Wan and Gu Yun Yao didn\u2019t have anything to do, they helped Su Mei do some needlework like sewing eyes on the tiger head shoes.</p><br/><p>All the way, these women got along harmoniously. There was only one thing that made Feng Qi Qi very surprised. That was the attitude Ming Yue Cheng had towards Gu Yun Yao. It wasn\u2019t like how it was rumored to be.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng announced to the world that in this lifetime he would only have Gu Yun Yao as his only women. He won\u2019t select consort in this life anymore. This incident made Feng Qi Qi admire him very much. In this feudal dynasty, it was not easy for a man who stood at the highest position to make such a promise to the woman he loves. Especially that Ming Yue Cheng was able to break all the pressure and stick to his decision. This was very remarkable and admirable.</p><br/><p>However, after this period of observation, Feng Qi Qi discovered that these two people were not like a man and a woman in love. No joy of a newly-wedded bride could be seen from Gu Yun Yao. Also, Ming Yue Cheng treated her with politeness. Or better said, it was more appropriate to describe it as coldness. No matter how you look at these two, they seemed strange.</p><br/><p>While Feng Qi Qi was observing Gu Yun Yao, Gu Yun Yao was also sizing her up.</p><br/><p>Gu Yun Yao was not a fool. The attitude Ming Yue Cheng had towards Feng Qi Qi these past few days was enough for her to guess who the person in Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s heart was. Originally, Gu Yun Yao thought that Ming Yue Cheng liked Gu Yun Wan. Because of Gu Yun Wan\u2019s identity as \u2018empress dowager\u2019, so he had no way but to use such a way to evade.</p><br/><p>However, after seeing Feng Qi Qi, Gu Yun Yao knew she made a mistake. The one Ming Yue Cheng truly loved is Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Now, Gu Yun Yao knew who the \u201cQi Qi\u201d Ming Yue Cheng talked about was. She also knew why this man did so many things. He was keeping his body pure as jade for her; for a dream that can be wished for but that won\u2019t become reality. He insisted on his heart and maintained his. This man couldn\u2019t help but let people feel sorry for him.</p><br/><p>However, it was one thing to feel sorry for Ming Yue Cheng, Gu Yun Yao didn\u2019t have any improper thoughts. She was a calm and intelligent woman. She would never covet something that wouldn\u2019t belong to her. Even if Ming Yue Cheng was the highly emperor of a country, Gu Yun Yao had never had any illusions about him. Moreover, after getting to know that the person in his heart was someone that she couldn\u2019t be compared to, she would even more not do any of those unrealistic dreams.</p><br/><p>After being on the road for ten days, they were finally about to reach White Bird mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still two days left!\u201d When Gu De told this news to everyone, Su Mei was obviously relieved. She was used to riding on a horse. Now, being inside the carriage for all day really suffocated her. So, the moment they arrived at the inn, Su Mei immediately jumped off the carriage and stretched her muscles.</p><br/><p>Contrary to Su Mei, Feng Qi Qi carefully went off the carriage. With Feng Cang\u2019s help, they took the cradle from the carriage. Even if it was a very common movement, she was able to make it look very \u2018elegant\u2019, making Gu Yun Yao a bit infatuated from looking at her. In her heart, she was more certain about why Ming Yue Cheng would be so attached to Feng Qi Qi. This woman was like a painting that could move, making people unable not to indulge in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d When Gu Yun Yao\u2019s mind was elsewhere, Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s voice rang beside her. \u201cAre you not going to get off the carriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right now!\u201d Gu Yun Yao jumped from the carriage. When she looked again, Feng Qi Qi had already gone far away.</p><br/><p>Really a beauty! Gu Yun Yao knew that she couldn\u2019t learn the noble aura that Feng Qi Qi emitted with every movement. Even the way she swayed when she walked was so beautiful like a rose in the wind; touching yet not losing its pureness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Seeing the dazed Gu Yun Yao, Ming Yue Cheng stopped in his tracks. \u201cYou seem a bit strange today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Gu Yun Yao didn\u2019t want to let Ming Yue Cheng know that she had discovered his secret. She quickly denied and followed behind Ming Yue Cheng to the inn.</p><br/><p>Fu Er had long let everyone prepare everything. When everyone entered, everything was arranged properly. After having dinner together, everyone returned to their room. After Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang entered their room, Jin Mo followed them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye 1, a letter from the house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo brought the news from Nalan Xin. The whole way from Bei Zhou to Nan Feng, every three days, Nalan Xin would write a letter about every movement in the capital, including the matters of Fo Sheng Men to Feng Cang. So, even if Feng Cang wasn\u2019t in the capital, he could also know what was going on at that side.</p><br/><p>After reading the letter, Feng Cang nodded. Jin Mo retreated. Feng Qi Qi came to Feng Cang\u2019s side. \u201cSomething happened at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is fine at home. It was just, Longze Jing Tian and Taji Guli haven\u2019t been found yet.\u201d When he said this, Feng Cang\u2019s eyebrow shook slightly. Even Fo Sheng Men and Moyu hadn\u2019t found them. Could it be that these two people grew wings and flew away?</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that someone helped them in secret? So, we couldn\u2019t find them? Or, some people don\u2019t want us to find them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words let Feng Cang thought about the disappearance of Taji Guli at Feng Xiao\u2019s one-month old banquet.</p><br/><p>That day, Wanyan Kang closed the gates at the fastest speed. Then, the Eagle troop did a thorough search. In the end, she was still able to escape. This shows that someone from Bei Zhou\u2019s officials was a group with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, it seemed that we need to do a new investigation.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why, but Feng Cang had a hunch that something was about to happen. Since the interior of Bei Zhou wasn\u2019t clean, then they need to find the domestic bad mouse first! Lest to let one mouse\u2019s poop spoil a whole pot of soup.</p><br/><p>After Feng Cang wrote a reply and handed it to Jin Mo, next was the world of this young couple.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi sat on the bed and breastfed Feng Xiao. The luster of the candlelight lit on her beautiful facial features, making her look more beautiful and touching. Feng Cang walked to her and sat next to Feng Qi Qi. He lowered his head and looked at how Feng Xiao used all his strength to suck milk. A happy smile appeared on the corner of his lips.</p><br/><p>This is his wife. This is his child. At this moment, just looking at Feng Qi Qi and Feng Xiao, Feng Cang\u2019s exhaustion would be swept away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d Feng Qi Qi turned slightly to let Feng Cang not look at her. Being looked by Feng Cang like this while breastfeeding made Feng Qi Qi a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, it had been more than two months\u2026\u201d Feng Cang put his head on Feng Qi Qi\u2019s shoulder. His chin rubbed against her shoulder blade. \u201cJin Mo said that the prohibition could be lifted two months after birth. I\u2026want you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>The intimate words of Feng Cang made Feng Qi Qi\u2019s ears burn. It seemed that the two of them haven\u2019t been intimate for a long time. Feng Cang had always adhered to the principle of protecting his wife. Even if it was hard for him to bear, he only used shower to relieve his heat. Counting it, he had been an ascetic monk for months.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, do you want me?\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s breath lingered on Feng Qi Qi\u2019s ear letting her ears feel itchy and numb. \u201cYou say, should we give Feng Xiao a little brother or a little sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll good\u2026\u201d Feng Qi Qi turned her head. Her lips just happened to rub on Feng Cang\u2019s lips. The two looked at each other. Their eyes were full of love.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! If we have a son, we three will protect you. If we have a girl, we two will protect you and our daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang just wanted to seize the opportunity to kiss Feng Qi Qi, he didn\u2019t expect that a \u2018wa\u2026\u2019 sound would separate him and Feng Qi Qi. When he looked, Feng Xiao was looking at his parents with teary eyes with a look of \u2018I\u2019m still here. Don\u2019t teach children bad things\u2019. He completely interrupted Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi\u2019s intimacy.</p><br/><p>Next to Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi were Ming Yue Cheng and Gu Yun Yao. These two people would pretend to be husband and wife in front of others, but they were not excellent actors. They couldn\u2019t act out the feeling of love. Everyone could see that this pair of emperor and consort was a bit too dull.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sleep on the bed, I will sleep on the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one bed in the room. Ming Yue Cheng took a piece of wood and placed it on the ground. Then he also took a quilt to the ground.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ming Yue Cheng was such a gentleman, Gu Yun Yao couldn\u2019t hep but sigh in her heart. She knew how sincere the feelings between Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi was. She also knew that Ming Yue Cheng was a good man. It was a pity that there was only one Feng Qi Qi. If she had a twin sister, Ming Yue Cheng wouldn\u2019t need to go on being so alone anymore.</p><br/><p>1. Wangye/wang: the prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

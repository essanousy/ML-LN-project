Who doesn\u2019t know Nan Lin wang\u2019s1 situation? Even if Murong Qi Qi went into a pit of fire herself, she shouldn\u2019t harm people like this.</p><br/><p>The four great families know that Feng Cang sent people to teach Murong Qi Qi. Now everyone believes Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words even more. Immediately, Duanmu Yi Yi forgot the pain in her face. She hastened away from Longze Yu Er and sat far away from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like miss Duanmu forfeited, then bengong2can only recommend princess Ping Yang. But what do we do?! You and I are princesses. If we married together who will be the first wife and who will be the concubine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pretended to have a headache. She thought for a long time and suddenly said: \u201cAiya, how can bengong forget? On the letter the emperor write to Bei Zhou clearly has bengong\u2019s name. Since it\u2019s like this, princess can only feel a bit wronged and be the concubine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er almost fainted from anger. She doesn\u2019t want to marry Feng Cang! Is because of this that Duanmu Qing pushed Murong Qi Qi out as the \u2018scapegoat\u2019! Marrying Feng Cang and also be the concubine, even if they beat her to death, she won\u2019t be willing!</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, what is your motive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Longze Yu Er finally understood why Duanmu Yi Yi hate Murong Qi Qi so much; because she is really hateful!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is princess\u2019s mood right now? Is your appetite better? If you still feel uncomfortable, then my maid is really guilty. Doesn\u2019t princess want to beat my maid? Quickly go do it, otherwise her sin will become bigger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, you have guts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that Murong Qi Qi is threatening her because of Su Yue, Longze Yu Er gritted her teeth: \u201cBengong is feeling very good now, very very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing young is so good. Say feel good and you\u2019ll immediately feel good! Su Yue, quickly say thanks to princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue suppressed her laughter and walked to Longze Yu Er. She bowed: \u201cSu Yue thanks princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>This pair of master and servant is obviously bullying her, but Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words are put there. Longze Yu Er really worries that if she took Su Yue, Murong Qi Qi will use underhanded ways to deal with her. She can only gulp down this anger. The second round, Murong Qi Qi won again.</p><br/><p>The women\u2019s liveliness reached the men\u2019s side. In their hearts a lot of people have a new assessment of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Ever since he heard that Murong Qi Qi needs to marry to Bei Zhou, Shangguan Wu Ji is very worried about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s situation. He wanted to go see her, but have been stopped at the door by the people of Bei Zhou. Now seeing the young girl\u2019s smile, Shangguan Wu Ji is happy for her, but he also feels somewhat at loss.</p><br/><p>Such a fine woman needs to marry Feng Cang! This is what Shangguan Wu Ji can\u2019t accept. Speaking of this, great family Shangguan and Bei Zhou\u2019s Feng family have a blood feud.</p><br/><p>Fifteen years ago, Xi Qi country and Bei Zhou county were at war at the border of Yangdang Mountain. Although it ended with Bei Zhou\u2019s defeat, but the truth is that 400000 Xi Qi\u2019s soldiers were beheaded by Bei Zhou\u2019s army. Countless people of Shangguan family died, including Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s grandfather and several uncles were killed in the battle.</p><br/><p>Since young, Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s dream is to become a great general to led Xi Qi\u2019s army against Bei Zhou to avenge the heroes of Shangguan family who died at that battle. But this dream hasn\u2019t had the time to realize yet and she is already leaving.</p><br/><p>Just in a few days, Murong Qi Qi became the victim of the political battle and needs to marry to the far away Bei Zhou, marry Feng Cang. How can Shangguan Wu Ji accept his? After all, after all, this is the first time his heart moved for a woman, ah\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that year, the one who helped Xi Qi\u2019s army out of trouble is Murong Tai. Precisely because Murong Tai\u2019s reinforcement arrived on time, Feng Xie suffered defeat, princess Ming Yue committed suicide to follow her husband. It can be considered that Murong Tai is Feng Cang\u2019s archenemy who killed his father and mother. Since it\u2019s like this, how can Feng Cang treat Murong Qi Qi well?</p><br/><p>Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s expression is not good. Li Yun Qing expression isn\u2019t also very good. He promised to protect Murong Qi Qi. Now he sees that she has become a chest piece of someone else, but he is unable to change the outcome, making him hate himself.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi still has a soft smile on, but in that soft smile there\u2019s stubbornness. It\u2019s this unyielding attitude makes Li Yun Qing feel more bitter. If, if he was one step earlier, will the outcome be different?</p><br/><p>For a time, the atmosphere on the boat became down. Murong Xin Lian seeing this immediately let the music play and let the dance girl perform to let the atmosphere go up. It\u2019s just that the song happens to be \u2018A Glance at the mundane world\u2019, making the people who knows where this song came from feel more conflicted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHearing this song once again reminded me of that day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei is the only one in this group whose mood is at peace.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that in the future we won\u2019t be able to hear such a good song anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei\u2019s lamenting has caught Murong Xin Lian: \u201cThird little sister, today\u2019s scenery is excellent, why don\u2019t you make a new song?! It as how young master Bai said, in the future when little sister marries too far away, the mountain is high and the road is long, we won\u2019t be able to hear little sister\u2019s voice anymore\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s attitude is very sincere. Her expression was also at place. She seemed to be very concerned about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s situation after she married to Bei Zhou. After all it the matter of Nan Lin wang being cursed and caused the death of his eight wives is a truth. It\u2019s still a question of if Murong Qi Qi will be able to survive the wedding night. Moreover, Feng family and Xi Qi country also has history\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because Murong Qi Qi is familiar with Murong Xin Lian\u2019s nature, Murong Qi Qi felt that she is almost taken over by Murong Xin Lian\u2019s acting.</p><br/><p>Because of Murong Xin Lian\u2019s words, the atmosphere on the boat turned more down. Even Duanmu Yi Yi who was laughing at Murong Qi Qi just now gave birth to a trace of pity. After all, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s life is more bitter than hers!</p><br/><p>The only ones who didn\u2019t change are Longze Yu Er and Murong Qing Lian. The ironic smile on their lips revealed their thoughts. They couldn\u2019t wait for Murong Qi Qi to be finished.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeference is no substitute for obedience!\u201d</p><br/><p>Deference is no substitute for obedience: accepting a request</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stood up. Murong Xin Lian has long guessed such a scene. Murong Qi Qi will never refuse. Seeing Murong Qi Qi walking into her trap, Murong Xin Lian\u2019s eyes flickered with happiness. She let people prepare the instruments.</p><br/><p>After the instruments has been brought up and there was no liuqin that Murong Xin Lian wants, Murong Xin Lian deliberately got angry: \u201cWhat? No liuqin? Why didn\u2019t you prepare liuqin? Princess Zhao Yang can only play the liuqin. She doesn\u2019t know how to play other instruments. How do you guys work?!\u201d</p><br/><p>liu qin</p><br/><p>liuqin</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s voice is very loud. After hearing her words, Longze Yu Er laughed: \u201cXin Lian jiejie, don\u2019t blame them! How can there be a liuqin at imperial big brother\u2019s boat? Only a cheap geisha will use liuqin. This is a wangye\u2019s boat and not a commoner boat for geisha\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>She means that it\u2019s not a pleasure boat</p><br/><p>The two people collaborated like one. Murong Qi Qi finally understand what Murong Xin Lian wants.</p><br/><p>Liuqin is a musical instrument which can\u2019t be put on the table. In front of these imperial and noble families it\u2019s a shameful thing. On the surface, they are talking about liuqin, but in truth they are belittling Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian has been watching Murong Qi Qi silently. The feelings that this girl gave him today is really too much. Longze Yu Er domineering and arrogant attitude is famous in the capital. She was actually able to be like a fox who exploited a tiger\u2019s might and quelled princess Ping Yang. This little woman is so brave.</p><br/><p>fox who exploited a tiger\u2019s might: intimidated someone powerful</p><br/><p>Now seeing Murong Xin Lian making things difficult for Murong Qi Qi, Longze Jing Tian is sitting still on the bench to watch. He wants to see how Murong Qi Qi will resolve this embarrassment.</p><br/><p>1. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank</p><br/><p>2. Bengong: this palace/ I, used by the females of the imperial family</p><br/>\n</div>"}

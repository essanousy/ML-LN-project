It\u2019s just, didn\u2019t Penglai Island always not intervene in the matters of the mainland? Why did they help Dong Lu this time?</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi go into the stage of thinking, Feng Cang couldn\u2019t help himself from kissing her forehead again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Qing Qing, don\u2019t think about this anymore. I already let someone go investigate! You worked so hard today; you need to rest well and relax. There\u2019s a hot spring here. Do you want to go take a bath in the hot spring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHot spring?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Murong Qi Qi who was tangled up in the matters of Jia Lan, immediately sat up after hearing about a hot spring. From her eyes, flashed a light as dazzling as the sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye,1 there\u2019s really a hot spring? Where? Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?! I like hot springs the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi liked it, Feng Cang was also happy. Especially after seeing her joyful like a small deer, he felt happy from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you tonight! The condition is that you obediently eat well!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hot spring Feng Cang talked about was located at the Fengyu villa outside of Yongzhou City. This was part of Feng Cang\u2019s territory and also his holiday villa. When they arrived at Fengyu villa, Murong Qi Qi became mesmerized by the beautiful scenery in front of her.</p><br/><p>From the distance, it looked like a red cloud. After getting closer, she found out that it\u2019s a garden full of red plum blossms.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mother loved red plum blossoms. So, father planted this place full of red plums. Every winter, father would bring mother here to relax and take a bath in the hot spring. Only when it\u2019s nearly the thirtieth of December, under the repeated urgings of grandmother and uncle, would they return back to the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang walked hand in hand with Murong Qi Qi in the red plum garden.</p><br/><p>Hearing Feng Cang talk about the story of his parents, Murong Qi Qi could only imagine how in love great general Feng Xie and princess Ming Yue were. It was said that princess Ming Yue was known to be the world\u2019s number one beauty. Feng Xie also had the title of the world\u2019s number one handsome man. They were the ideal couple and attracted the envy of others.</p><br/><p>Feng Xie and Wanyan Lie were friends who\u2019d played together since young. Their relationship were closer than real brothers. Wanyan Ming Yue and Feng Xie were also childhood sweethearts. The two had been engaged since they were very young. Wanyan Ming Yue was just over sixteen when she married Feng Xie. A year after becoming his bride, she gave birth to Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know if it was the scene that recalled memories or because at his side was the woman he loves, but something had evoked Feng Cang\u2019s memories of his parents. Today, Feng Cang said a lot of things about Feng Xie and princess Ming Yue. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t say a word and only listened quietly to Feng Cang\u2019s memories of the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter father and mother passed away, I didn\u2019t want to come here again. I was afraid that after seeing this garden full of red plum blossoms, I would think back about the happy past. So, I let people seal off the villa. Only now, when I planned to bring you here, did I let people clean it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, Murong Qi Qi understood why Feng Cang didn\u2019t bring her before. This Fengyu villa had been sealed by Feng Cang for sixteen years. This was the first time it had welcomed its owner after so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I will stay with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi buried her head in Feng Cang\u2019s chest. Her arms were tightly around Feng Cang\u2019s narrow waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I will stay with you in the place of great general and princess for this whole lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018promise\u2019 let Feng Cang\u2019s eyes get a bit wet. His big hand tapped Murong Qi Qi\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long any longer before you also call them father and mother. Qing Qing, come with me. I\u2019ll take you to a place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The place Feng Cang mentioned was a solitary grave site at the back of Fengyu villa.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s bones are still here, but my mother had been burned into ashes. Although uncle wanted to bury my parents together in the imperial tomb, but I insisted on burying them here. This was the place father and mother liked the most. Inside are my father\u2019s bones and my mother\u2019s dress. It\u2019s just, in here should be three people. My unborn little sister should also be here. At that time, she was only seven months and still in my mother\u2019s belly. She was burned to ashes together with mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was a bit surprised and also happy that Feng Cang brought her to visit the great general and princess Ming Yue. Could this be considered him taking her to meet his parents?</p><br/><p>Feng Xie\u2019s and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s grave had clearly been cleaned. There were a variety of fruits, barbecue and pork legs. In front of the cemetery were three yellow incense sticks. The smoke followed the wind. Around the entire grave was a layer of a light smell.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, mother, this is my wife and also your future daughter-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi tightly while introducing his beloved woman to Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer name is Murong Qi Qi. She is the woman I found after searching for a long time. I love her. From the first time I set eyes on her, I fell in love with her. I love everything about her more than I love myself. Today, I specifically brought her here to see father and mother. I believe you will also like her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis year, I\u2019ll stay at Fengyu villa to spend the new year with you. When we go back to the capital, we\u2019ll hold the wedding. In my whole life, I would only have her as wife. I would love, protect and pamper her like how father loved mother! We will definitely lead a happy life, have children, grow old together and never leave or betray each other!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi got tears because of Feng Cang\u2019s words. He really took her here to \u2018see his parents\u2019. This man\u2019s mind is so delicate; how could she not love him?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi quietly leaned against Feng Cang and looked at the vigorous characters on the tombstone. In her heart, she quietly made a promise: \u201cGeneral, princess, I would love wangye in your stead. Rest in peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fengyu villa\u2019s open hot spring emitted hot air. The temperature was moderate. In this winter night, it gave infinite warmth. Although this was an open hot spring, but it had been divided into two parts; one for men, one for women.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi, Su Mei and Su Yue were at one side. Feng Cang, Wanyan Kang and Jin Mo were at the other side.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang put his ear against the wall and listened to the sounds from the other side. However, Jin Mo pulled him back with his other ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, Jin Mo, what are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth highness, can you act like a gentleman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo scoffed a bit after seeing Wanyan Kang\u2019s behavior. No matter what, listening against the wall like a woman, would be looked down on.</p><br/><p>Seeing Jin Mo so serious, Wanyan Kang also scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that cousin brother doesn\u2019t have any other thoughts, right, cousin brother?! Don\u2019t you want to go to the other side to take a look at cousin-in-law, ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t speak. His black hair was let loose in the water like black seaweed, making volts in the water. That exceptionally, devilishly beautiful face was even more mesmerizing in the hazy mist.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! You remained silent, I will take it as if you agreed. Jin Mo, don\u2019t be so serious. You haven\u2019t meet a woman you love yet. If you meet one, you would be more tempted than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Towards Wanyan Kang\u2019s words, Jin Mo once again snorted disdainfully. In the end, he closed his eyes and ignored Wanyan Kang. He didn\u2019t want a woman! What he pursuits is the highest medical skills! How could he be the same as these commoners?!</p><br/><p>At the women\u2019s side, Su Mei and Su Yue left after soaking for a while, leaving Murong Qi Qi to lean quietly at the shore. The mist and water of the hot spring covered her neck and hid all the other parts.</p><br/><p>So comfortable! Since no one was here, Murong Qi Qi took off the Water Moon Mirror. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the warm water temperature. It seemed as though it had been a long time since she was comfortable like this.</p><br/><p>This time, the fact that Bei Zhou had gotten first place at the tournament of the four countries made her finally relieved. She hoped that when she returns to the capital, the empress dowager wouldn\u2019t continue to make trouble for her. She\u2019d already achieved the request Dongfang Lan made\u2026</p><br/><p>As Murong Qi Qi was relaxing with closed eyes, suddenly she heard some footsteps. Murong Qi Qi opened her eyes. She silently pulled the robe from the hanger at the shore and wore it. Just when she wrapped herself in it, a person in black appeared in front of her.</p><br/><p>This man had a doll mask on. A pink and white doll mask. The red mouth smiled very sweetly. At both cheeks of the doll were a touch of blush. Where the eyes should be, were two black holes. A pair of astute eyes were inside it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why are you dressed like that and deceiving people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked at the other party. Two silver threads appeared in her hand.</p><br/><p>The person in black looked somewhat surprised after intruding the hot spring. When he saw that face of Murong Qi Qi, he stood there, unable to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue\u2026,\u201d the person in black softly said. His voice was hoarse and slightly trembling as if he was suppressing his emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi thought she heard the two words \u2018Ming Yue\u2019, but she wasn\u2019t sure. When she looked again, the person in black had recovered his composure. He looked deeply at Murong Qi Qi once. Then he turned and jumped into the bushes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue, who\u2019d already dressed, came over. When Murong Qi Qi looked again, the person in black was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a stranger here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pointed in the direction the person in black had disappeared.</p><br/><p>The moment she heard a stranger had broken in, Su Yue immediately rushed over there. Su Mei also heard the noise. After hearing the commotion at the women\u2019s side, the men also found out that a person in black had appeared. Feng Cang quickly got dressed and rushed to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, are you alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice returned Murong Qi Qi to sanity. She quickly picked up the Water Moon Mirror and attached it to her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I\u2019m fine and very safe!\u201d</p><br/><p>After everyone got dressed, Su Yue came back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person in black is very familiar with the villa. This subordinate followed him to the plum garden and then lost sight of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue was a bit upset. She let the person in black escape under her eyes. Truly a dereliction of one\u2019s duty.</p><br/><p>The moment he heard from Su Yue that the other party was very familiar with the villa, Feng Cang\u2019s expression sank. He immediately summoned Fengyu villa\u2019s housekeeper and let the whole villa be searched. However, they searched for a whole night, but they didn\u2019t find a single sign of the person in black. This matter caused suspense.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi bit her lips and recalled that person\u2019s stature and then painted out that man\u2019s appearance. When Feng Cang saw the doll face on the painting, Feng Cang was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a powder doll mask that father had bought for me when I was a child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the housekeeper of Fengyu villa immediately went to the study to search. He found that the only thing missing was a doll mask.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this person was very familiar with Fengyu villa! Who is he? Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t think of anyone. Feng Cang also couldn\u2019t think of anyone. The whole villa had been turned over, but there were no signs of that person in black. Feng Cang could only let people strengthen the patrol.</p><br/><p>After this, the person in black didn\u2019t appear again. It was like he had evaporated from the world and never appeared again.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi constantly remembered everything about that person in black. She remembered he\u2019d said the phrase \u2018Ming Yue\u2019. What does this Ming Yue mean? Is it princess Ming Yue? It\u2019s just, princess Ming Yue had already passed away for so many years; why would this person use this name with such deep feelings to call her? Could this person in black be a follower of princess Ming Yue?</p><br/><p>These questions had been hovering in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mind. Before finding the answers to these questions, she won\u2019t tell Feng Cang about this. If the person in black comes again, she would catch him and let him make all of these clear!</p><br/><p>Finally, the 30th of December arrived. This year, because of the tournament of the four countries, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi were able to spend the new year at Fengyu villa. To be able to spend the new year with Feng Cang, made Murong Qi Qi very happy. Presumably, the annual lively palace banquet and the cumbersome court etiquette just couldn\u2019t compare to spending time with your beloved one.</p><br/><p>30th of December here refers to the Chinese lunar calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, it\u2019s somewhere between the end of January and the beginning of February</p><br/><p>Beside Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, there were also Su Yue, Wanyan Kang, Jin Mo, Ruyi and Jixiang present.</p><br/><p>On the night of the 30th of December, Feng Cang announced that everyone at Fengyu villa, regardless their status, would not be going home before getting drunk. This made the people who looked after Fengyu villa very happy. Wanyan Kang held a wine gourd and drunk wine with Ruyi and Jin Mo. Su Mei, Su Yue and Ji Xiang, these three young girls, were chatting at one side. Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi laid on the heated brick bed and looked laughingly at the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fengyu villa\u2019s housekeeper smilingly went to Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi while carrying wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little one, as the representative of the people from Fengyu villa, toasts to wangye and wangfei.2 I wish wangye and wangfei forever love and be together for hundred of years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The housekeeper\u2019s words made the smile on Feng Cang\u2019s face become wider. He raised his head and poured the cup of wine into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cReward everyone a half month of salary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking wangye! Thanking wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they heard that there was a reward and also half a month\u2019s salary, it made those people of Fengyu villa so happy, they all toasted to Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Although they only spent a few days together, but these people deeply felt the harmony of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Having a good-tempered and easy-to-get-along-with wangfei was the best thing for these people. Although Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi wouldn\u2019t be coming here often, but looking at the two masters, they felt that every winter they would be staying at Fengyu villa. If the master was good-tempered, then it was easy to serve, making the people save a lot of troubles.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, it\u2019s time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, midnight arrived. Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi, and went outside, escorted by the crowd. Fengyu villa was lit up brightly. When Feng Cang came out, the people who\u2019d already prepared the fireworks, lit them up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Boom!\u2019</p><br/><p>Beautiful fireworks bloomed in the quiet night. It was a light colored brush and painted the dark sky with vivid colors.</p><br/><p>\u2018Boom, boom, boom!\u2019</p><br/><p>Those fireworks opened as if it was a flower festival and met the arrival of the new year!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo beautiful! Miss, look, that one is so beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei liked to be lively and liked beautiful fireworks even more. Wanyan Kang came to her side and gave her two fireworks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>With one firework in the left hand and one in the right hand, Su Mei danced in the night.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful! Oh\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Kang roared. He also took two fireworks and danced together with Su Mei. With fireworks as weapon, the two \u2018fought\u2019 in the courtyard. The two \u2018fought\u2019 busily. The fireworks in their hands emitted a dazzling light. The light enveloped the two of them, making them appear even more beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo beautiful! Su Yue, go play! Jixiang, Ruyi, you also go play!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei\u2019s and Wanyan Kang\u2019s liveliness made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mood very good. Everyone lit one firework. A group of people holding fireworks began to play in the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, it\u2019s time. Make a wish, make a wish! Quickly make a wish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei began to shout. Murong Qi Qi quickly put her hands together, closed her eyes and made a wish. After she told Buddha all her wishes, Murong Qi Qi opened her eyes. She discovered a devilishly beautiful face had appeared in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, does your new year\u2019s wish include me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang looked forward to hearing the answer, but he suppressed the excitement in his heart for fear that Murong Qi Qi would laugh at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang like that, Murong Qi Qi winked at him flirtatiously and also gave him an ambiguous answer.</p><br/><p>The more Murong Qi Qi acted like that, the more anxious Feng Cang got. He simply pulled Murong Qi Qi into his arms and wrapped the two of them in his cloak.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, if you don\u2019t answer me, then I\u2019ll kiss you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside of the cloak, Feng Cang continued to coax. Just when Feng Cang wrapped the two of them in the cloak and isolated them from the others, it attracted the attention of the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang asked exaggeratedly. The people beside him laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi blushed. She didn\u2019t expect that Feng Cang would do something like this in front of so many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, answer me or let me kiss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the cloak, the heat was very strong. Feng Cang could feel that his face had become hot. However, he didn\u2019t intend to let Murong Qi Qi off so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s hot breath was getting closer to Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi could feel the hot temperature of Feng Cang\u2019s body. Her face burned. She was just about to answer when Feng Cang\u2019s lips was already on hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I love you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice had been swallowed by Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips. The word \u2018love\u2019 was also in his kiss and spread to her heart.</p><br/><p>Although this kiss was still not skilled, but Feng Cang was no longer shaky as the first time. His tongue explored the fragrance of her mouth. Not too deep, not too shallow; just right.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang pulled the cloak with one hand and blocked the two of them from the others. The other hand held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s slim waist, forcing her to get closer to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips were blooming like flowers and meet the gentleness of Feng Cang. Her toes also gradually left the ground. Outside the cloak, the fireworks continued to fire. Inside the cloak, the two were kissing in full swing.</p><br/><p>Only when their surroundings had quietened down, did Feng Cang slowly release Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips. This kiss took a long time; so long that Feng Cang had forgotten that outside, there was a crowd watching in fun. When he put down the cloak, Wanyan Kang\u2019s whistle immediately came over.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s red, swollen lips told everyone who saw them, exactly what had happened between the two of them inside the cloak. Wanyan Kang shouted in surprise: \u201cCousin brother is powerful, ah! So long! We waited from this year till next year, you two almost kissed for a year, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she heard Wanyan Kang\u2019s words, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face was red like it was on fire. It burned. Her whole body hid in Feng Cang\u2019s arms and she refused to raise her head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

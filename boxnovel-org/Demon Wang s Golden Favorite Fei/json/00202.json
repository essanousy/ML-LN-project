We will definitely find great miss. Guys, don\u2019t you all think so?!\u201d \u201cYes! Chief, don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone didn\u2019t rest for the whole night. They hurriedly filled their stomachs. A new round of search began again.</p><br/><p>White Bird mountain was very large. It would take half a day to search the entire mountain. Jin Mo followed the people of the Qiang tribe into the forest. Although, it was spring, but the weather wasn\u2019t that warm. However, the people of the Qiang tribe lived in the south and White Bird mountain was a dense forest. Not long after, everyone\u2019s back was full of sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat miss!\u201d \u201cLittle Wan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sounds echoed in the mountain. After Gu Yun Wan who was in the deep hole persisted for one night, her mouth and tongue were dry. She was thirsty and hungry. At this time, she didn\u2019t have the strength she had before. Even if she heard those voices, she couldn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Another day had passed. The people who had returned still didn\u2019t find Gu Yun Wan. This time, Gu De got anxious. \u201cHow could this be? Little Wan disappeared. Could she had been taken away by Longze Jing Tian? What does he want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi felt very guilty about Gu Yun Wan\u2019s abduction. The ones Longze Jing Tian probably hated were them. Naturally, he didn\u2019t want Feng Xiao\u2019s gu to be cured. Now, because of the matter of curing the gu, Gu Yun Wan got involved in this. These two people felt very guilty.</p><br/><p>Deep in the forest, the small group of Jin Mo were still looking for Gu Yun Wan. A whole day had passed. It was already evening. Jin Mo drank some water at the spring and wiped his mouth. They searched for such a long time and still hadn\u2019t found Gu Yun Wan. Could there be some places that they had missed? Just when Jin Mo was thinking about this, a green worm climbed on his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoo, goo, goo, goo\u2026\u201d the small worm weakly flicked its wings and made \u201cgoogoo\u201d sounds.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo had seen this worm before. Before, at Bei Zhou, in order to study the gu Jin Mo asked Gu Yun Wan to release her gu. The appearance of that one was exactly the same as this one.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where Gu Yun Wan is?\u201d When he saw the small worm, Jin Mo was very surprised. He immediately called the other people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis seems to be great miss\u2019s gu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s great miss\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>The small worm lingered in the left hand of Jin Mo. It looked very pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoo, goo\u2026\u201d The small worm was not a human being. It couldn\u2019t talk. It could only make sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to go save little Wan?\u201d</p><br/><p>The gu fanned its wings and flew.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow her. Maybe we can find great miss!\u201d Jin Mo followed behind this little worm. It fanned its wings with all its strength, but it was too weak. A while later, it fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat miss\u2019s gu is still a larva. It can\u2019t fly for too long. It must be that great miss encountered trouble and let the gu come back to tell us!\u201d Someone went forward and wanted to pick up the small worm, but he didn\u2019t expect that the small worm would flash its wings ad fell on Jin Mo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Jin Mo, it seems that great miss\u2019s gu trusts you! I have to trouble you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo nodded and gently stroked the wings of the small gu. \u201cSince you can\u2019t fly, then tell us the direction. If we go in the right direction, then make sounds, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoo, goo\u2026\u201d The gu agreed and nodded.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo sent someone to go notify the village. He took the other nine people and followed the gu\u2019s instruction to find Gu Yun Wan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo!\u201d \u201cGoogoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The gu continued to make sounds. Jin Mo let people follow the sound to distinguish the direction. They travelled back and forth through the forest. It took a long time before they came to the deep hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo, googoo!\u201d When they got here, the gu made fiercer sounds. It even jumped from Jin Mo\u2019s hand and fell on the ground. It directly climbed into the deep hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat miss is inside!\u201d Jin Mo immediately understood the gu.</p><br/><p>At this time, the sky was already dark. Someone lit a torch, and another used the surrounding vines to make an ordinary rope.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go down. Wait here for me!\u201d Jin Mo grabbed the vines and went down the hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeng\u2026.\u201d A group of bats saw that someone came and flew away immediately. The blood and rotten smell filled Jin Mo\u2019s nose and made him startled. The bats love the smell of blood the most. These bats came to eat in the hole. Could this blood be Gu Yun Wan\u2019s? Nothing happened to her, right?!</p><br/><p>Jin Mo held the torch with one hand and the other moved the branches and leaves.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wan?!\u201d When he saw the woman lying on the ground, he shouted, \u201cGreat miss is here. We found great miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the people at the entrance of the hole heard that Gu Yun Wan was found, they were very excited. Jin Mo checked Gu Yun Wan and found out that only her acupuncture point had been hit. He immediately released it and also took away the worn-out cloth from her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright? I will check for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I can\u2019t move,\u201d Gu Yun Wan said with difficulty. She had been in this position for a day and a night. Her blood wasn\u2019t flowing well. Her whole body was completely numb.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo immediately helped Gu Yun Wan improve her blood circulation. After massaging for a long time did Gu Yun Wan\u2019s limbs gain some of their sense of feel back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, let me piggy-back you back to above!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo reached out and put Gu Yun Wan on his back. Then, he climbed with the help of the vines to above.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat miss, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re alright!\u201d \u201cGreat miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>The others gathered around and helped Jin Mo put Gu Yun Wan down. Jin Mo once again checked Gu Yun Wan carefully. He wrapped the wounds on her body and knelt down to rub her legs that had been stiff for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? Why doesn\u2019t my legs have any feelings yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that the blood isn\u2019t circulating well. So, it\u2019s a little bit troublesome. Let\u2019s go back and talk then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo was a doctor. Even if Gu Yun Wan felt that something was not right, she still chose to believe Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>Immediately someone made a simple chair from the branches and vines. Jin Mo put Gu Yun Wan in the chair. Then, the group hurried back to the village. When they were halfway, some people came to pick them up. After Gu De got to know that Gu Yun Wan was found, he personally rushed over. When he saw Gu Yun Wan in the chair, Gu De was very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you came back! It\u2019s good that you\u2019re fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>When they were back in the village, Jin Mo found an opportunity to talk to Feng Qi Qi. \u201cJunior sister, something is not good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Feng Qi Qi was a bit puzzled. Why was is not good that Gu Yun Wan is found? \u201cSenior brother, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Yun Wan\u2019s acupuncture point had been hit and she had been thrown into the hunting hole. She hasn\u2019t moved for a whole day and night. The blood in her limbs isn\u2019t circulating well, maybe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo hasn\u2019t finished speaking, Feng Qi Qi already understood what he meant. Long-term immobility caused the blood to not circulate well. The nerves were oppressed and would cause necrosis. Could it be that such a thing happened to Gu Yun Wan?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, let\u2019s go take a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi handed Feng Xiao to Su Mei and hurried with Jin Mo to Gu Yun Wan\u2019s room. At this time, Gu Yun Wan had bathed and put on clean clothes with the help of her maid. However, her right hand and feet still have no feelings.</p><br/><p>When she saw Feng Qi Qi, Gu Yun Wan had an ominous premonition. She knew Feng Qi Qi\u2019s ability. Now, Feng Qi Qi came over and her expression was so serious, could it be that something had happened? When she looked at Jin Mo, although his expression hadn\u2019t changed, but his eyes were not right. Gu Yun Wan wasn\u2019t a fool. They were both famous doctors. The two came at this time and with these expressions, it didn\u2019t seem like they came to chat with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, are my legs ruined?\u201d Gu Yun Wan asked when Feng Qi Qi wanted to examine Gu Yun Wan, making Feng Qi Qi startled. Feng Qi Qi laughed, \u201cNo, I just came to see you! Besides, even if there\u2019s something, I will make you safe and sound!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Feng Qi Qi said this, Gu Yun Wan knew that there really was a problem with her legs. After Gu De heard the talk between Gu Yun Wan and Feng Qi Qi, he also moved closer to them. \u201cPrincess, if you have something to tell, tell us directly. What\u2019s the matter to my Wan er1?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, keep calm! I was just not sure, so I brought my junior sister to confirm the diagnosis! Don\u2019t worry, with me and my junior sister here, nothing will happen to great miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Jin Mo said this, Gu De\u2019s face sank. \u201cSo, something is wrong with Wan er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t say anything. After checking Gu Yun Wan once again, she stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, is it that I can\u2019t walk anymore? And my right hand can\u2019t move anymore?\u201d Gu Yun Wan couldn\u2019t accept this reality. This way, wouldn\u2019t she become a rubbish?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wan, don\u2019t think so bad of things. Your legs and right hand only temporarily lose their feeling. Trust me, you will be the same as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You didn\u2019t lie to me?\u201d Gu Yun Wan didn\u2019t believe it. From the moment she had been rescued by Jin Mo till now, her legs and right hand didn\u2019t have any feeling. Isn\u2019t this disability?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lie to me, I will hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve us, nothing will happen to you.\u201d Seeing Gu Yun Wan like this, Jin Mo squatted in front of her. \u201cYou need to cooperate well with the treatment, so that you can restore your health. You have been in the same position in the hole for too long. So, the blood isn\u2019t circulating well in your body and caused the current condition of your body. With acupuncture plus rehabilitation, your will restore your health soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of Jin Mo calmed down Gu Yun Wan\u2019s giddiness. She stared into Jin Mo\u2019s eyes. \u201cJin Mo, you won\u2019t lie to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. I and junior sister will definitely cure you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After comforting Gu Yun Wan for a long while did Feng Qi Qi left. Gu De followed behind Feng Qi Qi. The two walked for some distance before they stopped. Feng Qi Qi explained the reason why this condition had happened to Gu De.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, what do you mean with the vascular necrosis of the calf? How much chance does Wan er have at recovering? How long will it take to recover?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least half a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf-year?!\u201d Gu De\u2019s heart immediately hung on the air. \u201cYou said half-year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief doesn\u2019t believe in my and senior brother Jin Mo\u2019s medical skills??\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I believe you.\u201d Gu De didn\u2019t expect that things would be so bad. Half-year, how could Gu Yun Wan accept it?</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi saw Gu De\u2019s worries from his expression. She quickly comforted him, \u201cChief, I only estimated the period roughly. As long as little Wan coordinate well with senior brother\u2019s acupuncture and my message, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t take so long. Little Wan is a strong girl. Nothing will happen to her, believe me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words were very sincere letting Gu De slowly put his fears down. Now, the one he hated the most was Longze Jing Tian. Not only did he kidnap Gu Yun Wan, but also harmed her like this. \u201cAll the blame is on Longze Jing Tian! I must find him and kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>1.

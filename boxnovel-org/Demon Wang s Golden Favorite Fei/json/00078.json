The branch in his hand has long been changed into silver needles. \u2018Sou, sou, sou\u2026\u2026\u2019 they flew towards Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo making his attack let Ruyi feel sweat for Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know what had happened, but Jin Mo followed wangye1 for ten years. He wouldn\u2019t lie. Besides, Murong Qi Qi indeed knows martial arts. This was something they didn\u2019t expect. It made Ruyi believe Jin Mo\u2019s words even more.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that, saying Murong Qi Qi was Xi Qi\u2019s spy, Ruyi didn\u2019t believe that either. After all, getting along for such a long time, he felt that Murong Qi Qi was a good person. At least, her heart must\u2019ve moved for wangye and she also didn\u2019t look like the bad guys. Now that Jin Mo had changed the branch for silver needles; he obviously had the intention to kill, making Ruyi feel anxious.</p><br/><p>If Jin Mo really slipped and killed Murong Qi Qi, what would Feng Cang do when he wakes up? Ruyi saw very clearly wangye\u2019s good feelings towards Murong Qi Qi these past few days. Ever since this little wangfei2 showed up, the smiles appeared a lot more on wangye. Even Ruyi, who had been at his side for so long, was surprised.</p><br/><p>Wangye truly loves Murong Qi Qi! Ruyi was very sure of this. No matter what Murong Qi Qi\u2019s background was, if Jin Mo really kills Murong Qi Qi today, then no matter if it\u2019s intentional or not, when wangye wakes up, he would be in pain and maybe he would also kill Jin Mo\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If Jin Mo died, then there would be no one left who could treat Feng Cang\u2019s disease. By then, what could they do? Should they just watch wangye die?!</p><br/><p>In just one moment, Ruyi\u2019s brain experienced a strong struggle. No! He must stop Jin Mo! No matter who Murong Qi Qi is, it\u2019s wangye who should make the decision!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Ruyi intended to rescue Murong Qi Qi. However, those silver needles were only an inch away from Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t dodge or hide. She seemed to not know that danger was coming at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With no time left to use an attack to stop, Ruyi could only shout to warn Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo was surprised that Ruyi was helping Murong Qi Qi. It also let him have a more \u2018profound\u2019 understanding of Murong Qi Qi. Ruyi followed Feng Cang since an early age, so how did Murong Qi Qi bribe him in such a short period?! This woman was indeed a devil!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Jin Mo\u2019s attacks became more ruthless.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi still didn\u2019t move. Only when the silver needles were almost in her eyes, did she wave her hands and let the silver needles enter her sleeves. She then turned her hands and shot the silver needles back at Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>One attack, \u2018falling flowers, flowing water\u2019, made Jin Mo stunned. By the time he came out of the daze, the silver needles had already pierced his shoulders. He felt a burst of numbness. Oh no, there\u2019s anaesthetic on the needles! The numbness on his body immediately let Jin Mo think about the anesthetic Murong Qi Qi had previously smeared on the dagger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why do you know \u2018falling flowers, flowing water\u2019?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth while pulling out the needles from his body. Jin Mo\u2019s eyes locked with Murong Qi Qi\u2019s. This \u2018falling flowers, flowing water\u2019 was his master, the holy doctor\u2019s unique attack. Why does Murong Qi Qi know it? What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my master taught me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is your master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo was even more puzzled. Master didn\u2019t accept female disciples. Impossible. Murong Qi Qi and him absolutely didn\u2019t come from the same master!</p><br/><p>Seeing that Jin Mo didn\u2019t believe it, Murong Qi Qi took out a bone needle.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Mo, do you recognize this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRhinoceros needle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo recognized the bone needle in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand. This was master\u2019s most treasured thing. It was actually in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands! This was too incredible!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you steal it from?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Mo, in your heart, is my character so bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi humphed coldly. Now she knew how much prejudice Jin Mo held against her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder the old man doesn\u2019t like you. You really are not likeable. Fortunately, in the end, old man got such a treasure apprentice like me. That\u2019s why he passed me the rhinoceros needle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo was completely startled. If what Murong Qi Qi said was true, then she\u2019s his junior sister. She actually called master old man! So rude! So disrespectful!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Murong Qi Qi\u2019s finger appeared an ancient silver ring.</p><br/><p>Seeing the silver ring, the doubts in Jin Mo\u2019s heart disappeared. He immediately knelt on one knee. That ring was the symbol for the status of the holy doctor. Now, Jin Mo definitely knew Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity. She was Lian gongzi, the one who was nicknamed strange doctor, his junior brother.</p><br/><p>Before, in the letter master wrote to him, he said clearly that he passed down his legacy to his (JM) little junior brother Lian gongzi. He also said that seeing the silver ring was like seeing him. Only after Murong Qi Qi took out the silver ring, did Jin Mo believe her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, eldest senior brother, why are you giving me such a big bow?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi slowly walked to Jin Mo and swung the silver ring in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, didn\u2019t you not believe me? I had to take out master\u2019s token for you to believe me. It seems that you\u2019re quite afraid of the old man, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo understood that Murong Qi Qi was making fun of him, but he no longer talked back. Just now, he treated Murong Qi Qi like that. Why shouldn\u2019t he let her lessen her anger?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just, Jin Mo never thought that Lian gongzi would be a woman. Besides, he believed that he (Lian) was living at the ends of the earth, but actually he\u2019s right under their noses and was Murong Qi Qi! This is really too surprising! Master praised Lian gongzi very much and boasted that he was a rare genius of hundred years.</p><br/><p>Originally, he thought that strange doctor Lian gongzi appeared and disappeared unpredictably. Jin Mo never expected Lian gongzi having this identity and living so low-key at his side.</p><br/><p>Small obscurity is like an open space. Middle obscurity is like a market. Big obscurity is like the imperial morning court. She played out this poem vividly. Who would know that the princess who had come to form a marriage alliance, princess Zhao Yang, the rubbish in the eyes of people, was also the strange doctor Lian gongzi whose fame shook the world! Hiding at Feng Cang\u2019s place was indeed an excellent plan.</p><br/><p>Meaning of the poem: the greater the genius, the more concealed he/she is</p><br/><p>Ruyi was far away, so he didn\u2019t hear Jin Mo and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s talk, but after seeing Jin Mo kneel in front of Murong Qi Qi, Ruyi was somewhat shocked.</p><br/><p>This evil doctor, aside from wangye, didn\u2019t acknowledge anyone. Just now, he shouted that he wanted to kill Murong Qi Qi, but now he\u2019s acting like this. In the end, what had happened? Inside Ruyi\u2019s heart appeared a big question mark. If it wasn\u2019t because he needed to take care of Feng Cang, he would\u2019ve certainly gone over to see what\u2019s happening!</p><br/><p>Only after letting Jin Mo kneel for a while longer, did the anger inside Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart subside. Although Jin Mo was somewhat unreasonable, but he\u2019s extremely respectful towards master. This silver ring was originally a keepsake of a doctor. Seeing the ring was like seeing master. This concept had been deeply ingrained inside Jin Mo\u2019s head!</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest senior brother, get up! The ground is cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>After putting away the silver ring, Murong Qi Qi personally helped Jin Mo up.</p><br/><p>Knowing that Murong Qi Qi did it intentionally, but Jin Mo could only smile bitterly. Before, he gave her many bad faces, he didn\u2019t think that she would have remembered them all. Indeed, it\u2019s preferable to offend a vile character than to offend a woman. Especially women with such ability like Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, should I call you little junior sister or should I call you princess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Murong Qi Qi once again, Jin Mo felt somewhat uncomfortable. Since Murong Qi Qi was his little junior sister, then she wouldn\u2019t harm Feng Cang. Thinking back of those misunderstandings, Jin Mo felt somewhat embarrassed. He misunderstood a good person! However, he cannot be blamed entirely, ah. If Murong Qi Qi made her identity known earlier on, then these misunderstandings wouldn\u2019t have happened at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi raised her head, narrowed her eyes and looked at Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest senior brother, now you should tell me the things about Feng Cang. Fetal poison, cold poison and gu poison; who did it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo laughed bitterly and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a doctor. My task is to heal the dying. As for those things that happened in the past, there\u2019s no need to know them clearly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo saying that made Murong Qi Qi want to pry his head open and see what he was thinking. Knowing the patient\u2019s past would enable them to understand the mind of the one who poisoned him better and also let them have more information about the antidote and help them more with detoxification. Could it be that he didn\u2019t know this?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes senior brother want to conceal it, or does senior brother really not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you want to know, why don\u2019t you go ask wangye in person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo\u2019s voice had just faded when they heard Ruyi\u2019s voice: \u201cWangfei, mister, wangye has woken up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye woke up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Murong Qi Qi heard this, her heart jumped up from joy. This was the best news she\u2019d ever heard. She immediately rushed to Feng Cang. Before she ran away, she said to Jin Mo: \u201cAsking eldest senior brother to help me keep my identity a secret! Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After arriving in front of Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes looked in the once again black eyes of Feng Cang. Excited, she suddenly flew into Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang, how are you feeling? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Must say that Jin Mo\u2019s skills were excellent. Feng Cang was now restored to his original appearance and did not look as frightening as before.</p><br/><p>When he opened his eyes, the fact that he was able to see Murong Qi Qi and hold her, let Feng Cang\u2019s disturbed mind calm down. Just now, he was really afraid that Murong Qi Qi would leave him because of his ugly side. He didn\u2019t expect that at the moment he had woken up, she was at his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I\u2019m sorry, I let you be worried!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang gently hugged Murong Qi Qi. His chin rubbed her hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Before I was so fierce towards you and scared you, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, if you apologize to me, then it\u2019s as if you\u2019re regarding me as an outsider. Today, I was wrong. If I had known that wangye was feeling unwell, I wouldn\u2019t have let wangye accompany me. Wangye also wouldn\u2019t have suddenly gotten sick. I was wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi combed Feng Cang\u2019s hair with her hands, full of heartache. Her hand gently touched Feng Cang\u2019s cold face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, next time, if wangye encounters uncomfortable things, wangye must tell me and let me know. Watching wangye being uncomfortable without being able to do anything made me feel very useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s tears fell. Thinking about the pain Feng Cang had suffered, Murong Qi Qi felt heartache. The cold poison and gu poison in his body were at least ten years. He had the fetal poison since birth. Really don\u2019t know how he survived all these years! It must\u2019ve been very hard, very very hard!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, are you crying for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at that drop of crystal-clear tear on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small chin, Feng Cang couldn\u2019t help but take her once again in his embrace.</p><br/><p>Before, he didn\u2019t tell Murong Qi Qi, because he was afraid that she\u2019d worry and even more afraid that she\u2019d leave him. Thinking about it now, he should abandon all of those thoughts. How would his woman have the same thoughts as ordinary women?!</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll surely not hide it from you. Really, I promise you!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the snow ground, these pair of lovers told their inner feelings as though no one else was around. Ruyi was very sensible and retreated. Jin Mo looked deeply at Murong Qi Qi and then also retreated to one side.</p><br/><p>If saying that in the past, he thought that Murong Qi Qi had a hidden motive in approaching Feng Cang, now he was completely at ease. It so happened that master had said in the letter that this little junior sister was very skillful. He should discuss this with her and quickly find a cure for Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>However, Jin Mo didn\u2019t know why Murong Qi Qi wanted to hide her identity from Feng Cang. She has martial arts and knows medicine which is good for Feng Cang. Why does she need to keep it a secret?</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Qi Qi had already become the best candidate to be Feng Cang\u2019s wife in Jin Mo\u2019s eyes. If Murong Qi Qi knew that Jin Mo hoped for a wife who understood medicine in order to take care of Feng Cang; knowing that all his thoughts were in consideration of Feng Cang, she would certainly take a good guess as to what kind of feelings Jin Mo had towards Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>To Ruyi, Jin Mo explained a bit about the misunderstanding between him and Murong Qi Qi in a simple way. In the end, he directed him to \u2018seal\u2019 his mouth and don\u2019t tell Feng Cang about their dispute and that Murong Qi Qi had martial arts.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister, it\u2019s a good thing that wangfei has martial arts, ah. Why shouldn\u2019t we let wangye know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyi\u2019s mind was simple and didn\u2019t understand the hidden meaning inside. Letting him keep it from Feng Cang was impossible. Unless, there\u2019s really a good reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet wangfei be wangye\u2019s hidden dagger\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo\u2019s words were very simple. Ruyi understood immediately. So, it\u2019s like that! Wangfei deliberately hid her martial arts in order to protect wangye, ah! Although they were wangye\u2019s personal bodyguards, but there were times where they would be negligent. In that case, there would be wangfei. So, there\u2019s no need to worry anymore!</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang and the others returned to the entourage, Su Mei and Su Yue immediately came forward to greet them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, is all alright with you?! Where did you go for so long, making us very worried?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi hadn\u2019t finished speaking yet, when Wanyan Bao Zhu rushed over,</p><br/><p>\u201cCang gege3, where did you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the worried expressions on Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die, who had followed behind her, Murong Qi Qi deliberately nestled into Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, in the future, you should take me to relax, yo! Being bored in the carriage every day really is too uncomfortable. It\u2019s better to go outside and have a world with only two people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Have a world with only two people: a romantic couple\u2019s world.</p><br/><p>The moment Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die heard that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi went out on a \u2018date\u2019, their expression immediately changed.</p><br/><p>This Murong Qi Qi was wrapped around Feng Cang every day in the carriage and now she even went out with him, she really didn\u2019t know what kind of thing \u2018shame\u2019 was.</p><br/><p>Immediately, Mu Yu Die opened her mouth to make things difficult for Murong Qi Qi: \u201cPrincess Zhao Yang, you and wangye are not married yet. There\u2019s a saying that men and women should not touch hands when they give or receive things. Asking princess to have self-respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Men and women should not touch hands when they give or receive things: men and women shouldn\u2019t be alone together nor have physical contact.</p><br/><p>\u201cSelf-respect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi acted like she heard the biggest joke. The eyes looking at Mu Yu Die were immediately full of sarcasm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, wangye and I have a marriage agreement. Men and women cultivating feelings before the marriage is a normal thing. Miss Mu indeed knows what self-respect is, but why is it that every time, you\u2019ll rush to gather yourself to be at my family\u2019s wangye\u2019s side?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being talked like that by Murong Qi Qi, made Mu Yu Die\u2019s face become red.</p><br/><p>She was not like Wanyan Bao Zhu who liked Feng Cang and made it known to everyone. She was a low-key and subtle person. She silently looked at Feng Cang, hoping that one day he\u2019d turn around and notice her existence. So, her thoughts being pointed out by Murong Qi Qi, made Mu Yu Die ashamed into anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cZeze!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at that beautiful face of Mu Yu Die which was now red like a monkey\u2019s butt, Murong Qi Qi chuckled. Her head leaned against Feng Cang\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Anyway, these women already hated her to death. They could never be friends. Why should she give them face when they are making things difficult for her?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the rule say that a female player\u2019s age can\u2019t surpass eighteen? If I didn\u2019t remember incorrectly, miss Mu\u2019s age is already over twenty. If it\u2019s found out that you have concealed your age to participate in the tournament, the people who know will say that miss is infatuated with our family\u2019s wangye and deliberately hid your age to get close to wangye. The people who don\u2019t know, really don\u2019t know how they will see our family\u2019s wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi deliberately saying \u2018our family\u2019s wangye\u2019 repeatedly, made Feng Cang really happy. Through observing these talks, Feng Cang found out that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s possessiveness was quite strong. This point made Feng Cang very satisfied. Only when a woman cares about a man did they become so overbearing. She wants to be bossy, he is willing to let her be!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that beloved consort says it, benwang4 remembers. Miss Mu indeed doesn\u2019t meet the rules of the tournament. Benwang was indeed negligent in this matter. This time\u2019s tournament is being held in Bei Zhou. If this matter is discovered by the other countries, it\u2019ll certainly cause disputes. Servants, escort miss Mu back to the capital. Benwang will find another candidate to replace miss Mu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just one sentence from Murong Qi Qi was able to let Feng Cang make Mu Yu Die go away; it made people couldn\u2019t help but have a whole new level of respect for her and they also became aware of her position in Feng Cang\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, wangye, I won\u2019t go! I sincerely want to participate in the tournament! I sincerely want to bring glory to the country!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die never imagined that Murong Qi Qi would be so \u2018vicious\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t tolerate her (MYD)!</p><br/><p>This tournament between the four countries, which happened once every five years, was extremely rare. Because she was sick during the last tournament, she was unable to participate. This time, she\u2019s over the age limit. It was only because she knelt, cried and begged for a long time in front of her grandfather, that in the end, prime minister Mu said some good words in front of the emperor. That\u2019s why she was able to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenwang believes miss Mu\u2019s sincerity, it\u2019s just that the rules must be followed by all countries. Bei Zhou is no exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s answer was cold, unlike the gentleness he showed Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, not being able to participate in the tournament, alright! Please, asking you to allow me to watch the tournament! I want to experience what the tournament of the four countries is like. Don\u2019t send me back!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was as usual, Wanyan Bao Zhu would have clapped at Mu Yu Die suffering defeat. However, today Wanyan Bao Zhu didn\u2019t feel any happiness. After all, she and Mu Yu Die have a common enemy\u2026\u2026Murong Qi Qi. If there\u2019s no Mu Yu Die, wouldn\u2019t her (WBZ) power be weaker? One more person is one more force, ah!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Bao Zhu went forward to plead for Mu Yu Die: \u201cCousin, since miss Mu\u2019s age surpassed the limit and she can\u2019t participate in the tournament, let somebody take her position. However, we\u2019ve been on the journey for so long. Now letting her, a woman, go back alone, it\u2019s not safe and it\u2019s not justifiable. Wouldn\u2019t it better to let miss Mu go with us to Yongzhou?! Letting her only look at the tournament will also be good, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Wanyan Bao Zhu was speaking, she gave the other candidates a meaningful glance. The princess already opened her mouth, they also couldn\u2019t refuse. So, they all went forward and pleaded for Mu Yu Die.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t put those people in his eyes. He directly lowered his head to ask Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi saw and understood all those glances of Wanyan Bao Zhu. It seemed that she and Mu Yu Die were now standing on the same side. If she sent Mu Yu Die back, then wouldn\u2019t Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s power weaken? Then where would she (WBZ) have the ability to \u2018bully\u2019 her (MQQ). And when would she, Murong Qi Qi, have the chance to pull down the two of the, at once?!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince princess opened your mouth to plead, this face, I should naturally give; otherwise, it\u2019ll let people think that wangye is too inhumane. It\u2019s better to let miss Mu stay! Speaking of which, she is also a pitiful person. Missing this opportunity, the next half of her life, she might not have this blessing anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words caused the laughter of one person. Wanyan Kang stepped on the snow and came towards them. His mouth was still wearing that black belly smile. He gave Murong Qi Qi a big thumbs up.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, you and cousin-in-law went away to have the world for you two alone, really let people wait for a long time. Next time, why don\u2019t you bring us along?! If you don\u2019t mind\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBenwang minds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi when he went inside the carriage, leaving a cold sentence: \u201cBenwang hates bum beetles the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bum beetle: someone who tags along</p><br/><p>The moment Feng Cang\u2019s words came out, Mu Yu Die almost cried. It\u2019s certainly Murong Qi Qi who gossiped in front of Feng Cang. That\u2019s why he shamed her like this in front of everyone. It must be that! If before, Mu Yu Die\u2019s hatred towards Murong Qi Qi was only fifty percent, now it has upgraded to one hundred percent.</p><br/><p>Seeing Mu Yu Die\u2019s expression, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t become happy. These past few days, Feng Cang was also cold towards her. No matter how she dressed, mature and beautiful or pure and pleasant, his eyes were always locked onto Murong Qi Qi. At his side, there was also always Murong Qi Qi.

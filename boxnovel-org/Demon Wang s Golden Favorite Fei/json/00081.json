They didn\u2019t even turn back their heads, fearing that the man with the scar may regret his actions and bring them back.</p><br/><p>When the two were far away, the man with the scar and the others dismounted their horses. They came to Murong Qi Qi and bowed respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi turned and swept her eyes over these serious faces, one by one. Then she laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, long time no see! Looks like you are in great spirits!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeihei, miss, we\u2019re all very good. We just miss you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorty touched his head and laughed,</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei sent a letter and said there are people who want to harm you. We rushed over. Miss, you won\u2019t blame us for being meddlesome, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I?! You came at the right time!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar led a horse to Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi mounted the horse. She changed from the weak appearance to a formidable and valiant look.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s get those two bitches back!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the road, Murong Qi Qi found out that when she had left, Su Mei had been following them. Later, she sent a pigeon with a letter to the man with the scar which resulted in them waiting here.</p><br/><p>\u201cTie Xue, you said you encountered Wu Ji Gong\u2019s people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was somewhat surprised. She also told the man with the scar about Wu Ji Gong\u2019s soft fragrance powder.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where are Wu Ji Gong\u2019s people? Where did you bring them to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKilled.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are just some disdainful things. Killed them to avoid them dirtying miss\u2019s eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad! We can push this matter onto Wu Ji Gong\u2019s head!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after, Murong Qi Qi and the others caught up with Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die. When the two saw that the man with the scar had chased after them, they were very scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do? Didn\u2019t you say that you will let us go? Why do you go back on your words now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI indeed wanted to let you guys go, but my family\u2019s miss is unwilling.\u201d</p><br/><p>The men opened a road. Murong Qi Qi riding a horse, went to Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you run really slow, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! It\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was very surprised. After the surprise, came the anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, you actually colluded with bandits and wanted to plot against bengong1!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZezeze!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi gently clapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThief calling thief. Princess\u2019s ability to bite is very good, ah! If it wasn\u2019t because you deliberately took me out of the city and also used soft fragrance powder in the incense, I\u2019ll also wouldn\u2019t think of a way to deal with you. Now, you\u2019re saying that I plotted against princess; then if I don\u2019t kill you, then wouldn\u2019t I let your good intentions go to waste?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you dare\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Shua\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The right hand Wanyan Bao Zhu used to point at Murong Qi Qi was cut off by the shorty.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous! Dared to be rude to miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu felt so much pain that she rolled onto the ground. Blood splashed onto the white snow. Red bright stars, very beautiful, but after a moment, they were frozen by the cold weather.</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die was now completely scared. She didn\u2019t know what to say. She could only stare blankly at Murong Qi Qi. Below, something warm rolled down and wet her pants. Miss, what kind of miss? What relation does Murong Qi Qi have with these people? What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, where did the soft fragrance powder come from? Who contacted those people from Wu Ji Gong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi dismounted the horse. Stepping onto the snow, she came towards Wanyan Bao Zhu. The whip in her hand gently hit the ground, splashing a few pieces of snow which flew to Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s face, making her numb because of the cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cChou, Chou er2\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu felt very painful, but this cold weather kept her mind awake, making her unable to faint.</p><br/><p>\u201cChou er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi frowned. She remembered this time, there was indeed a woman who followed behind Wanyan Bao Zhu. It\u2019s just that woman was covered with a veil and she didn\u2019t care. But now, thinking about it, that Chou er definitely was strange. Could it be this Chou er was one of Wu Ji Gong\u2019s people? But Wu Ji Gong don\u2019t know that she\u2019s Du Xian Er. If they knew, they would have anxiously turned their backs and run, how would they come and search for trouble? It seems that there are some secrets that aren\u2019t known yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi turned. A scream could be heard. The man with the scar had already gotten rid of Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t kill me. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know anything\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Witnessing Wanyan Bao Zhu being killed by the man with the scar, Mu Yu Die was so scared that she slid off the horse and sat paralyzed on the ground. Her voice trembled and her teeth clattered against each other, making \u2018gege\u2019 sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I really don\u2019t know anything. Everything was done by princess, it\u2019s not me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Mu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi squatted in front of Mu Yu Die. Seeing the smile on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face, Mu Yu Die backed two steps away. Her eyes were full of fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not me. It has nothing to do with me! Princess said I only needed to be a witness\u2026\u2026. Don\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWitness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this word, Murong Qi Qi immediately got an idea. The next moment, a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant appeared in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Look at it and forget everything that had just happened. You don\u2019t know anything. Don\u2019t know anything\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know anything,\u201d Mu Yu Die obediently followed what Murong Qi Qi said. She stared at the pendant and slowly repeated the words Murong Qi Qi said. Her eyes slowly became lifeless.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know anything. I don\u2019t know anything\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Mu Yu Die collapsed, Murong Qi Qi retrieved her hand and mounted the horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cTie Xue, leave some people to clean up here. Don\u2019t let people find out anything. Bring them to the side of those corpses of Wu Ji Gong. This is done by Wu Ji Gong. It has nothing to do with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, why did you leave that bitch\u2019s life? She\u2019s also an accomplice! Anyone who deals against miss deserves to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the vast snow, Murong Qi Qi was riding a horse at the front. Beside her followed the man with the scar. Behind them followed that group of people. The man with the scar was somewhat unhappy about Murong Qi Qi letting Mu Yu Die off the hook. From his point of view, the ones who offended miss, their fate could only be death. Letting Mu Yu Die go, she got off the hook too easy!</p><br/><p>\u201cTie Xue, killing people won\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d Murong Qi Qi smiled. \u201cSometimes, living can be more painful than death for some people. Besides, saving one\u2019s life will enable you to build the seven-floor pagoda. This miss is kind hearted. Sparing her means amassing good fortune\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In ancient china, it\u2019s believed that if you lived with a kind heart, you will be able to build more floors of the pagoda</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, don\u2019t scare us! If you are kind-hearted, then wouldn\u2019t our Moyu be a Buddha to release all living creatures from suffering?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorty\u2019s voice came from behind, making the group of people laugh.</p><br/><p>They had lived together for five years. How would these people not understand Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ways! Murong Qi Qi left Mu Yu Die alive, presumably because she had another use! The shorty pitied Mu Yu Die from the bottom of his heart. Being left alive by miss is not her blessing. It\u2019s her fate!</p><br/><p>\u201cTalkative!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked back. The whip knocked the shorty\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Jing, did you do the things I ordered you to do, done? Where did you chose to be the world\u2019s number one place of business?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi ask about this thing, the shorty immediately let his horse catch up with Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I found a fengshui treasured ground. That ground is really good! The place is surrounded by three cliffs, with only one road to go up! As long as we occupy the ground, even if people want to attack us, they would be unable to go up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fengshui: is a Chinese philosophical of harmonizing everyone with the surrounding environment\u2014from Wikipedia</p><br/><p>The place the shorty was talking about was called Wind Chase Cliff. These cliffs towered till the clouds. Only a small road to go up. All three sides had a cliff. Under the cliff was the raging Nu river. It\u2019s a good place. Before, when Murong Qi Qi looked at the map, she also took a fancy to Wind Chase Cliff. She didn\u2019t expect that the shorty and her would have the exact same thought.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the shorty was so confident, Murong Qi Qi sincerely wanted to make things difficult for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if there\u2019s a really able person who was able to go up with his martial arts, by then do you want us jump off the cliff and be buried in the Nu river?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, you saying those words, is like not believing me! With my ability, not even a half year, I absolutely can make a secret road out! By then, we won\u2019t be afraid of anything! Really, miss, I didn\u2019t lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi talk like that, the shorty became anxious. He immediately explained his design.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I sketch the design out for miss to take a look?! I didn\u2019t brag!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! I was teasing you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the shorty being angry till his face became red, Murong Qi Qi laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, Fang Jing handling the affairs, of course I\u2019m at ease. But I want to take a look at the design. After all, this place will be the base of our Moyu in the future. I can\u2019t take brother\u2019s life as a joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi saying \u2018brother\u2019 repeatedly, made these people very moved. Beside fighting and killing, they didn\u2019t know anything else. Since miss came, these people slowly began to have a backbone. They know miss is good towards them, so they are very loyal towards Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026,\u201d hearing Murong Qi Qi say that, the shorty was very happy, but his expression showed some hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the shorty being so reluctant, Murong Qi Qi reined her horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Miss, Wind Chase Cliff is a place of Fu Sheng Men. Before, I wanted to buy it, they didn\u2019t want to sell. They said what they have is money!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Sheng Men is a \u2018good\u2019 sect.</p><br/><p>Mentioning the people of Fu Sheng Men, the shorty got angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said such a matter, we need to find the head of their sect. Who doesn\u2019t know that the head of Fu Sheng Men, Long Ao Tian, is like a ghost. We searched for a long time and still didn\u2019t find that bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Sheng Men, the organization in this mainland which made people change color whenever they hear about it. No one knew where the disciples of Fu Sheng Men were. Also, no one knew who the head of Fu Sheng Men was. Everyone knew that in this black world, Fu Sheng Men was the emperor.</p><br/><p>Assassinating with poison, no one was better at it than Moyu. However, Moyu had always been not much trouble. Moyu\u2019s sir Mozun was also only obsessed with poisonous things. He had never involved himself in other matters and was water from the well doesn\u2019t bother with water from the river with the other sects. Moyu could be considered one of the oldest surviving sects in this black world.</p><br/><p>Water from the well doesn\u2019t bother with water from the river: everyone minds their own business.</p><br/><p>Fu Sheng Men was the contrary of Moyu. Fu Sheng Men was established ten years ago. Within only five years\u2019 time, it eliminated the black world, annexed large and small sects and became the boss of the underground kingdom.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s said that Long Ao Tian\u2019s ways were ruthless; that no one could compare. Before, when annexing the other sects, as he met with rebels, he\u2019d kill all without mercy. However, he was also a very capable person. He created Fu Sheng Men. In a short time, he brought Fu Sheng Men to such a great height. Their power was extraordinary.</p><br/><p>However, Fu Sheng Men and Moyu didn\u2019t have any conflicts of interest. Plus, sir Mozun once helped out Fu Sheng Men when it was in trouble. So, Long Ao Tian also remembered this kindness. Both sides were at peace.</p><br/><p>Now, seeing the shorty\u2019s expression, Murong Qi Qi laughed. Fang Jing was pretty good at everything. Especially at manufacturing, he was a genius. There\u2019s just one bad thing. He had a really bad temper. He could compete with Su Mei at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, why are you smiling? Wind Chasing Cliff really is a good fengshui place. I can bring you to take a look! I did according to miss and traveled to the sixteen states. I only took a fancy to such a place! Using this place to build the world\u2019s first place of business is really too good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Jing, since we can\u2019t buy it with money, then we\u2019ll snatch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t give, then rob it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words were like a bandit\u2019s, making everyone surprised for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, do you mean what you said? Really rob it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorty didn\u2019t believe it and asked one more question: \u201cThat\u2019s Fu Sheng Men\u2019s territory! Going head on? This is really good, ah! I didn\u2019t take action for a long time! My hands are really itching. Really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Fu Sheng Men who is more powerful or if it\u2019s us who is more powerful\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019</p><br/><p>Not waiting for the shorty to finish, the whip in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands once again landed on the shorty\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly knows fighting and killing. How many times have I told you, when the problem can be solved with brains, then don\u2019t use the hands! Also, people should have self-confidence. It\u2019s of course, our Moyu who is one level higher. Could it be that this miss can\u2019t be compared to Long Ao Tian?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Yes! It\u2019s I who said the wrong thing! With miss here, why bother who he is? Everyone will become side dishes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorty suffered defeat. He laughed twice and touched his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, what should we do? Miss, there are already movements in Nan Feng country. Not even a month\u2019s time, Ming Yue Cheng will accomplish his mission. We did business in the sixteen states, we must have a place to build our roots, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnder the whole heaven, every spot is the sovereign\u2019s ground. To the borders of the land, every individual is the sovereign\u2019s minister. Didn\u2019t you say this place is within Yongzhou? This Yongzhou is Bei Zhou\u2019s territory. I don\u2019t believe Fu Sheng Men can go against the imperial power! Leave this matter to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the whole heaven, every spot is the sovereign\u2019s ground. To the borders of the land, every individual is the sovereign\u2019s minister: All the lands and people belong to the emperor.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi said that, the man with the scar and shorty understood. Murong Qi Qi will use Feng Cang as a way out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, no! We can\u2019t sacrifice you because of this matter! Feng Cang that sicko is not good enough for miss. I won\u2019t let miss sacrifice your sex appeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019</p><br/><p>The shorty received one more whip on the head. The two times before, it only made his head itchy. This time, Murong Qi Qi used a third of her power, making the shorty jump while clutching his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, what I said is the truth. You want to seduce Feng Cang. We all object!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the shorty bring out the words she usually said, such as \u2018seduce\u2019, Murong Qi Qi said a \u2018pei\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I look like such people? Fang Jing, what kind of mess is your head thinking about all day? Could it be that after you got over adolescence, your heart is beginning to stir? Do you want me to search a wife for you to let her console you the whole night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words amused everyone, making them laugh. Feng Jing quickly waved his hand. His face was red like a tomato.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t need! I didn\u2019t mean it like that! I don\u2019t want women!\u201d</p><br/><p>After laughing, Tie Xue said: \u201cMiss, do you want to start from Nan Lin wang?3 There is a way. The Bei four states are Nan Lin wang\u2019s fief. As long as he nods, this way is possible. It\u2019s just, we don\u2019t know if Nan Lin wang and Fu Sheng Men have any kind of relation with each other. Why does Long Ao Tian have territory in the Bei four states?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the man with the scar said that, Murong Qi Qi thought for a long time. If Feng Cang does indeed have some kind of relationship with Long Ao Tian, then will he continue the friendship with Long Ao Tian or will he take her side? In this short time, Feng Cang was that good to her. This matter would be a good test.</p><br/><p>Men, if they truly loved a woman, they would not wait to dig their hearts and lungs out for her. Not to mention those mere possessions! A man not willing to spend money on a woman was not a good man. Equally, a man who didn\u2019t make a woman\u2019s wish come true was also not a good man. When loving a person, you needed to fulfill all her requirements and not only talk emptily about love. Is that not a thankless wretch?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go try. If it really can\u2019t be done, then let\u2019s snatch it! I\u2019ve taken a fancy to Wind Chase Cliff. Our world\u2019s best place of business must be built there!\u201d</p><br/><p>When saying those words, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s attitude was very firm. Even Tie Xue and Fang Jing were shocked and in awe of their miss\u2019s powerful aura. This is their Moyu\u2019s miss. This is their head! Need this kind of aura! Tie Xue and Fang Jing exchanged a smile.</p><br/><p>On the other side, when Zhao Lang and Chou er arrived, the blood on the ground had been frozen. Seeing those bodies of his underlings, Zhao Lang expression changed. He reached out to explore. All ten people didn\u2019t have breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow? Did they all die? Who did it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er clutched her mouth and looked at the bloody ice. She didn\u2019t expect that the result would be like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang\u2019s face became sullen. Suddenly, he saw Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die at one side. He immediately approached and inspected. He found out that Mu Yu Die had fainted and Wanyan Bao Zhu had not only broken her right hand, but her death was extremely tragic.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

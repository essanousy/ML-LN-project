That was why, his heart was always high above others. Now, suddenly getting a cold face from Murong Qi Qi, he truly wasn\u2019t accustomed.</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cold attitude towards Wanyan Yi. Then, seeing that there was talking and laughing between Murong Qi Qi and Wanyan Kang, Lin Ke Xin was a bit worried. Could it be that Wanyan Kang was the pavilion closest to the water enjoys the moonlight first and acted in advance? How could this be right! Murong Qi Qi is the second daughter-in-law, she took a fancy on. She\u2019s Wanyan Yi\u2019s imperial consort, how could she marry Wanyan Kang?!</p><br/><p>The pavilion closes to the water enjoys the moonlight first: benefit from intimacy with a close person.</p><br/><p>The second here refers to WY being the second son of WH, although he\u2019s the first son of LKX. Children are counted from the paternal line.</p><br/><p>At this point, Lin Ke Xin had disgust for her younger son Wanyan Kang. Little brother stealing big brother\u2019s bride, such a scheme, such tactics; she really misjudged her younger son! Didn\u2019t expect that Wanyan Kang who was usually all of smiles would have thoughts about the throne. Really hateful!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi gave a cold shoulder to Wanyan Yi and only talked with Wanyan Kang, making Wanyan Yi very awkward. Several times, he wanted to intervene, but didn\u2019t know what to say. For the first time, that kind of setback emerged in Wanyan Yi\u2019s heart. He truly didn\u2019t like this feeling.</p><br/><p>Just as Wanyan Yi wanted to pull his and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s relation closer, a \u201cHis highness, the crown prince arrived! Her highness the crown princess arrived! Princess Bao Zhu arrived!\u201d came in. With the arrival of these three, Jingxin hall became livelier.</p><br/><p>When Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu saw Murong Qi Qi, immediately feelings of envy, hate and jealousy emerged in their heart. In this world, there was actually such a beautiful and touching person. She abruptly defeated the two of them (in looks).</p><br/><p>Before marriage, Yu Shi Shi was a famous beauty Bei Zhou. However, compared to Murong Qi Qi, she has a lesser aura and got more ordinary. Also, when Wanyan Bao Zhu was Murong Xin Lian, she had the title of the number one beauty of Xi Qi\u2019s capital. However, in front of Murong Qi Qi, even she felt ashamed because that kind of quick-witted was what she lacked the most.</p><br/><p>Now, the feelings Wanyan Bao Zhu had towards Murong Qi Qi was not the kind of hatred from before. They were more like seeing her as her enemy and also wanting to destroy the other party.</p><br/><p>She already heard about the matter of Murong Tai and Li Qiu Shui. She didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity was so noble and was far from what she could compare to. Originally, she thought about how to step on Murong Qi Qi in the future. However, now it seems that it was just her wishful thinking and extravagant hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle cousin sister Feng\u2026,\u201d Since Wanyan Hong came in, his eyes didn\u2019t leave Murong Qi Qi. The day before, Murong Qi Qi wore a red palace dress and looked more beautiful than imagined. Today, she wore a yellow dress. It was fresh and pleasant, giving away another flavor.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to big cousin brother!\u201d Like with Wanyan Yi, Murong Qi Qi only softly answered with one sentence. It was not cold nor warm, not close nor far. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s attitude let Lin Ke Xin be a bit more at ease. Fortunately, her attitude towards Wanyan Hong was the same. It seemed that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart didn\u2019t have someone she fancied.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong didn\u2019t even mind the slightest about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s attitude. Well, woman needs to have character! In his view, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s alienation was a character. It was stronger than those women who immediately jumped in his arms when they know he\u2019s the crown prince.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did little cousin sister arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Hong looked thoughtfully at Wanyan Kang and then looked at Wanyan Yi. He was just about to say something, when he heard Jing De\u2019s voice, \u201cThe emperor has arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie came? Lin Ke Xin\u2019s heart burst of excitement. She immediately led the bunch of people to welcome the emperor.</p><br/><p>The one who came with Wanyan Lie was Feng Cang. After the morning court meeting, Feng Cang couldn\u2019t let go of his worries. So, he came with Wanyan Lie. After seeing that Murong Qi Qi was safe and sound, did he let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother\u2026,\u201d When everyone was bowing and shouting long live ten thousand years, Murong Qi Qi rushed to Feng Cang like a little bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wear more when coming out? Where\u2019s the heater? Why didn\u2019t you bring it?\u201d Feng Cang took of his fox fur coat and put it on Murong Qi Qi. Then, he put her small hands in his big palms.</p><br/><p>The relation between these \u2018siblings\u2019, aside from letting people be envious, in their eyes, it also had another layer of meaning. Once the husband and wife, now became siblings. Don\u2019t know how these two people changed their roles so quickly. However, looking at their intimacy, they seemed to be closer than siblings. It seemed that relationship was not so easy to put down.</p><br/><p>The strange siblings in the eyes of others, in Wanyan Lie\u2019s eyes was something happy. Their relationship was so great and they were so close, making Wanyan Lie a bit envious. Looking at Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, he thought about himself and Wanyan Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, his feelings for Wanyan Ming Yue were buried in his heart. He could only forever look at her from afar. Now, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s relationship was so great; he had a feeling that he found an intimate friend. His dream wasn\u2019t realized. How great would it be if it could realize on this pair of siblings\u2026?</p><br/><p>He and Wanyan Ming Yue ended in a tragedy. If the people who are now experienced the same thing as them, also be broken up, then wouldn\u2019t it be too pitiful? In the past, he didn\u2019t get happiness. However now, he has the power to let people get happiness. If these two children really love each other, then he\u2019ll support them!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie had long forgotten how much he hated Feng Cang and also forgotten how he even more hated Feng Xie who got Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s heart. All these years, every time when he thought about how Wanyan Ming Yue became someone else\u2019s bride, his heart would get very cold. That was why, he used all means to get revenge through Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Now, he threw away all those things he did to Feng Cang in the back of his brain. What he saw was now a pair of bitter lovers like him in the past\u2026</p><br/><p>More than once, Wanyan Lie hated from the bottom of his heart that in his body flow he same blood as Wanyan Ming Yue. If they weren\u2019t siblings, he would certainly fight over her with Feng Xie and would certainly get Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s heart. He would become a pair of ideal lovers with her. However, he couldn\u2019t change his identity and also couldn\u2019t change his fate. This was the thing he hated the most!</p><br/><p>Now, seeing Feng Cang repeat his road and was like the him of the past, Wanyan Lie had the feeling that their hearts beat as one.</p><br/><p>However, Feng Cang is happier than him because at the same time Feng Cang likes Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qi Qi also likes him. They\u2019re each other\u2019s sunshine. However, they also couldn\u2019t change the fact that they have the same blood. No matter how much they struggle, they couldn\u2019t change their identity as siblings.</p><br/><p>Why are tragedies always repeated? A trace of compassion emerged in Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart. It was sympathy towards Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, this pair of unfortunate lovers. At the same time, there was also a trace of support for them.</p><br/><p>After all, in the past Feng Cang said the vow, \u201cRuo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it.\u201d And the him of that year, wasn\u2019t he the same as today\u2019s Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>Ruo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it: there are so many potential lovers to choose from, but you only pick one from among those potential lovers.</p><br/><p>Li: Chinese mile: 500 meters</p><br/><p>Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know Wanyan Lie\u2019s thoughts. If they knew, they would\u2019ve been very taken aback! It was said, accompanying one\u2019s sovereign is the same as accompanying a tiger. An emperor\u2019s heart is the most difficult to guess. It had been like this since ancient time. Wanyan Lie was also like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, come, let uncle take a look!\u201d Wanyan Lie lovingly beckoned Murong Qi Qi. When she approached, Wanyan Lie nodded while looking, \u201cLooks like your mother. Really looks like your mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know why, but she didn\u2019t feel disgust from Wanyan Lie\u2019s eyes. Instead, she could sense that the care and concern in this person\u2019s eyes were real. Really strange\u2026Questions rose in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart. If the matter of that year was done by Wanyan Lie, if everything that happened to Feng Cang was \u2018thanks\u2019 to Wanyan Lie, why when facing her, would he be so indulgent?</p><br/><p>How would Murong Qi Qi know that after Wanyan Lie saw her and Feng Cang\u2019s affection, Wanyan Lie\u2019s got the idea to support them and also came up with a plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, come inside. It\u2019s cold outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Qi Qi, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go inside and don\u2019t get a cold! Our Bei Zhou\u2019s weather is not comparable to that of Xi Qi\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin was somewhat jealous at Wanyan Lie\u2019s concern for Murong Qi Qi. The emperor has many children, but she never saw him be so amiable before and use such a gentle voice towards anyone. Instead, he was like this when facing Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Feng clan already got too much imperial grace. Feng Cang held the military power and is someone who could produce clouds with one turn of the hand and rain with another in Bei Zhou. Now, there\u2019s one more Murong Qi Qi. Then, wouldn\u2019t Feng clan\u2019s power reach the skies?</p><br/><p>After entering the hall, Murong Qi Qi sat next to Feng Cang. Although, they only didn\u2019t see each other for a moment, but to both, it felt like a long time had passed. Everyone saw the exchange of amorous glances between these siblings very clearly and they also understood clearly. In their hearts, they were puzzled if these siblings truly couldn\u2019t go back to proper human relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cNan Lin wang1 and little cousin sister\u2019s relationship is so great! Making people envious!\u201d Wanyan Lie faintly said that. He wasn\u2019t a fool. How could the feelings Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes conveyed be that of siblings? It was obviously that of lovers!</p><br/><p>Although Wanyan Yi wanted to marry Murong Qi Qi, because getting Murong Qi Qi meant getting the world. However, he was more willing to defeat Feng Cang. After all, a wang of a different surname holding military power is not a good thing for the whole court.</p><br/><p>Even if in the future, he became the emperor, Murong Qi Qi became the empress and Feng Cang became his brother-in-law, but in history there were more than enough cases where the brother-in-law usurped the throne! He wouldn\u2019t let his guard down just because he got the beauty and in the end, lose the country.</p><br/><p>What if by chance, Murong Qi Qi was a beautiful bait Feng Cang put out and the motive of these siblings was to get the country? Then, wouldn\u2019t he lose very badly?</p><br/><p>Now, in Wanyan Yi\u2019s point of view, Murong Qi Qi was a drug which exuded temptation. If getting addicted and fell into some people\u2019s trap, in the end, he would lose more. However, if he could use this drug to deal with Feng Cang and at the same time win the power in one swoop, then it would be half the work, but twice the effect!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie forgot that Feng Cang\u2019s power was given by Wanyan Lie. He also has forgotten that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity was raised by Wanyan Lie. His whole mind was thinking about how to deal with Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi; how would he know that the boss above him would or wouldn\u2019t let such a thing happen?</p><br/><p>\u201cFlesh and blood were separated for so many years. Now, they identified each other, naturally they would be close. If siblings weren\u2019t close to each other, then wouldn\u2019t it be unreasonable?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who spoke for Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi was actually Wanyan Lie. These let the two involved parties surprised and also let the others see Wanyan Lie\u2019s love for them.</p><br/><p>In just a moment, Wanyan Hong decided. He must get Murong Qi Qi. This person is a beauty; he likes that. The meaning behind this person; he likes that even more.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, when Chun Xing came to East palace to find him, she said those words from the empress.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour emperor father had always wished to get a daughter like princess Ming Yue. Moreover, he said if the daughter is like Ming Yue, he would certainly give the world to her. Now, the emergence of Feng Qi Qi let your emperor father\u2019s wish be fulfilled. No matter what, you need to get Murong Qi Qi. Even if you couldn\u2019t get her heart, you need to get her body. By then, your emperor father would give this world as the dowry of princess Zhen Guo to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was a fact that empress Li Bing was not favored, but Wanyan Hong knew, as the woman who accompanied emperor father the longest, empress mother was able to hold on the phoenix seal and also her position was never shaken, she must have her own ability.</p><br/><p>Just the thought of that red gecko cinnabar mark on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s snow-white arm, Wanyan Hong was so excited. He had seen many women, but one with such white and soft skin, Murong Qi Qi was the first one.</p><br/><p>Just now, when Wanyan Yi \u2018provoked\u2019 that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s relationship was like that of lovers and not of siblings, Wanyan Hong sensed the anger from emperor father. It could be seen that the place Feng siblings had in emperor\u2019s heart was very heavy. He had to admit, sometimes, Feng Cang\u2019s status was even above his.</p><br/><p>If he could marry Murong Qi Qi, that means that the throne is in his hand and the beauty in his arms. Besides, he would have a brother-in-law with military power. Although this brother-in-law wouldn\u2019t be willing to be manipulated, but he could use Murong Qi Qi to restrict Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang\u2019s expression, he certainly loves Murong Qi Qi to the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>If he controlled Murong Qi Qi, does he even need to be afraid to not be in control of Feng Cang? Even if by then, Feng Cang had the mind to usurp the throne, he could throw Murong Qi Qi out. By then, Feng Cang would lose his reputation and would lose the hearts of the commoners. Even if he (FC) had the ability, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of his (WH) palms!</p><br/><p>However, in order to get Murong Qi Qi, the first one he needed to get rid of is the one who had the position of crown princess, Yu Shi Shi\u2026He need to let her get off that position. Otherwise, if he let Murong Qi Qi get the position of cefei2, emperor father wouldn\u2019t be satisfied. Instead of waiting for emperor father to act, he may as well act first. Maybe by then, he could even get a good impression in front of Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong and Wanyan Yi, this pair of imperial brother\u2019s thought were contrary to each other. Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu, these two women\u2019s thought were amazingly very similar.</p><br/><p>From Murong Qi Qi, Yu Shi Shi saw an unprecedented crisis. She saw the desire from Wanyan Hong\u2019s eyes clearly. This man is someone ruthless and unscrupulous. If his heart was bent on marrying Murong Qi Qi and disposing herself, what should she do? On whom can she still depend on now?</p><br/><p>Because Murong Qi Qi threatened her position, Yu Shi Shi considered her, her number one enemy. And Wanyan Bao Zhu, at this moment just hate everything about Murong Qi Qi. In the past, she (MQQ) was Murong household\u2019s legitimate daughter and was above her (WBZ). Now, she\u2019s Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Zhen Guo and was even more above her. How could Wanyan Bao Zhu accept this?</p><br/><p>Why was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s life better than hers? Why was it that Murong Qi Qi was always more advantageous than her? She refused to accept that!</p><br/><p>Now, Wanyan Bao Zhu and Longze Jing Tian\u2019s wedding didn\u2019t even have the first stroke of the character eight, but it was already certain that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s future would be Bei Zhou\u2019s empress. This was obviously above her again. How could Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s competitive heart accept this?! Time after time, she was oppressed and stepped on by Murong Qi Qi. When would such days end?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t even have the first stroke of the character eight: things have not begun to take a shape</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t resigned, resigned that everything about Murong Qi Qi was stronger than her!</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was very strange. Murong Qi Qi took everything from the others into her eyes. No matter if it was envy, jealousy, hate, or unwilling to be reconciled and calculations; all of these made her feel that it was funny. Originally, she didn\u2019t want to participate in anything. However, she had been put in this place by Wanyan Lie. She couldn\u2019t not face these. Thinking of it, she\u2019s the most innocent one.</p><br/><p>Since this identity brought her a lot of trouble; if she didn\u2019t use her identity to show off once, wouldn\u2019t she put those deep meaning in these people\u2019s eyes to shame?</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, eunuch Jing De said Long Autumn palace is the most beautiful place of the harem, is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotions in the people\u2019s eyes, directly teased out Murong Qi Qi\u2019s rebellious heart. The more people are jealous of her getting the imperial love, then should would let this love be worthy of its name!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! What, do you want to go take a look?\u201d From the tone of Murong Qi Qi, she seemed to be interested in Long Autumn palace. Wanyan Lie was very happy.</p><br/><p>Before the battle at Yandang mountain, Wanyan Lie already emptied Long Autumn palace. Even though, he knew that Long Autumn palace was the residence of the empress since ancient times, but he still refused to bestow it to Li Bing. In Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart only Wanyan Ming Yue was worthy of living in Long Autumn palace. Until later, when he placed Wanyan Ming Yue in the underground of Long Autumn palace, only then did he get those women.</p><br/><p>Now, Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s daughter Murong Qi Qi returned. Of course, he should \u2018return it back to its rightful owner\u2019 and let Murong Qi Qi live there. In the past, how much did he wish for her mother to live there. Although, this wish couldn\u2019t be fulfilled, but that didn\u2019t mean he gave up.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Ming Yue had been in a deep sleep for so long and refused to wake up to look at him. If she knew that her daughter was found, if he let her hear stories about Murong Qi Qi and hear Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice, would she forgive the things he had done and would wake up?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Anyway, sitting is also quite boring!\u201d While Murong Qi Qi spoke, she stood up. Feng Cang put the cloak on for her. He also considerately prepared a heater and gave it to Murong Qi Qi. Until after, she got everything done, was he assured.</p><br/><p>This intimate move of these siblings changed taste in everyone\u2019s eyes. Only Wanyan Lie was delighted. It seemed that he saw his younger self and the young gorgeous Wanyan Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all don\u2019t have to go! Zhen 3 will accompany Qi Qi there! Cang er, you also take a rest. With zhen here, no one would bully Qi Qi!\u201d When Feng Cang put on the fox fur coat and was about to go together, Wanyan Lie said that. He excluded everyone other than Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie wanted to be alone with Murong Qi Qi? This let Feng Cang\u2019s heart be alarmed. After all, Wanyan Lie did many black-hearted things towards Feng family. If he wanted to do something against Murong Qi Qi, then what should he do?!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, wait here for me!\u201d Murong Qi Qi smiled sweetly at Feng Cang and gave him reassurance. If Wanyan Lie wanted to do something to her, she would just take his head and regard it as revenge for Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue. Then, she could also leave here sooner with Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Following Wanyan Lie, a bunch of people mightily went to Long Autumn palace. When they arrived at Long Autumn palace, Wanyan Lie let the servants stop and only went inside with Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Have to say, this Long Autumn palace was the most the most extravagant with gold and jade glorious splendor, Murong Qi Qi had ever seen. It was way more splendid than the hall Wanyan Lie used for court meetings. What let Murong Qi Qi be surprised was that this Long Autumn palace was filled with plum blossom.</p><br/><p>1. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Cefei: second ranked consort of the prince of first rank or the crown prince</p><br/><p>3. Zhen: I, used by the emperor</p><br/>\n</div>"}

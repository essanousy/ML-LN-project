If emperor father search for the blame, benwang1 will have an explanation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stretched out her hand to catch the \u2018break off engagement\u2019 letter Longze Jing Tian threw at her. She swept her eyes once over it and once satisfied, passed it along to Su Yue so she could guard it well.</p><br/><p>Leaving Lian gongzi\u2019s2 embrace, Murong Qi Qi bowed at Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking wangye 3 for your help! Hoping that wangye will find the woman you like very soon and fly together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Longze Jing Tian frown. Could it be that she knew the matter of Du Xian Er? On second thought, that was entirely impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Murong Qi Qi, you better make the best out of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, he found a reasonably excuse to dump this rubbish. This made Longze Jing Tian\u2019s mood become very good. Suddenly, he felt his whole body relax. Not having a marriage anymore, he could now openly go search for Du Xian Er! Just thinking of the fairy in the forest made Longze Jing Tian feel happy.</p><br/><p>It was just that when he turned and looked at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s bright smile under the sunlight, Longze Jing Tian had a feeling of defeat. She actually wantes to leave him so much and wanted to take off the identity of Jing wangfei4 that everyone else wanted?</p><br/><p>Not being wanted by a rubbish, more or less damaged Longze Jing Tian\u2019s proud self-esteem.</p><br/><p>\u201cActing on wangye\u2019s words, I\u2019ll surely live till hundred and scourge the millennium!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words thoroughly annoyed Longze Jing Tian. He immediately flipped his sleeves, turned and left. The others were lost behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really deserved it\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Hong Chen looked once at Murong Qi Qi, taking joy out of her calamity. Then he followed behind Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle cousin sister, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Longze Jing Tian left, Li Yun Qing sighed. He was not Longze Jing Tian, so of course he wouldn\u2019t believe those nonsense words of Murong Qi Qi. It was just that he didn\u2019t think that she wanted to free herself. Could it be that it was really like the song she sang that night?</p><br/><p>However, deep in his heart, Li Yun Qing was happy because Murong Qi Qi got her freedom back. Did this mean that he has a chance?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig cousin brother, can this Long Hu Ling really ask you to do anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being seen through by Li Yun Qing, Murong Qi Qi wasn\u2019t a bit surprised. Such an intelligent man, how could he not see through her little play?!</p><br/><p>Seeing the Long Hu Ling in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand, Li Yun Qing became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, this is my Li family\u2019s keepsake. As long as you\u2019re holding the Long Hu Ling, you can ask the people from Li family to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s thick eyelashes shook violently. The dagger in her hands cut open Lian gongzi\u2019s cloth in a lightning speed.</p><br/><p>Even as he felt the danger and dodged at his fastest, but the pain in his abdomen and the wet clothes told Lian gongzi that Murong Qi Qi had wounded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, you want to murder your husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian gongzi smiled in pain and quickly touched his acupuncture point to stop the blood. He then wiped medicine on the wound and used his ripped clothes to bandage it. He had forgotten wang\u2019s words when he was leaving: Docile on the outside, but in reality, you cannot mess with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did evil doctor Jin Mo get a hobby of being an imposter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Evil here doesn\u2019t literally mean evil. It means he is a doctor of the dark side of the jianghu.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi went to one side. In her hand was the dagger Shangguan Wu Ji had gifted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuining my reputation, do you think you can still leave here smoothly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Dang\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi took out the Long Hu Ling and threw it to Li Yun Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the second time that Li Yun Qing saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s speed. The first time was when she had kicked Duanmu Yi Yi in the lake. The second time was just now. In front of that lightning speed, even Li Yun Qing would be humble. Was she really a physically weak woman?</p><br/><p>Not thinking anymore, Li Yun Qing took action against Lian gongzi.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo, who had been confused by Murong Qi Qi\u2019s smile, at this moment understood. He had fallen into Murong Qi Qi\u2019s trap. She must have long seen through his identity and had the gall to use him to act in her play. And now, she even wanted him killed!</p><br/><p>Sure enough, women and villains were difficult to raise. A little woman like Murong Qi Qi must surely not offend.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Wu Ji at one side, after hearing the dialogue between them, finally understood that this man in blue clothes wasn\u2019t actually Lian gongzi. Just thinking about how his nonsense words ruined Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reputation, Shangguan Wu Ji got angry. He clenched his fists, roared once and rushed towards Jin Mo\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, no matter what, I still helped you. How can you take revenge on the one who helped you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being attacked at the front and the back, even if Jin Mo was a level seven expert, he couldn\u2019t escape from Shangguan Wu Ji and Li Yun Qing\u2019s well-coordinated collaboration.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst sin, being an imposter; second sin, ruining my reputation; third sin, having ulterior motives. Jin Mo, you didn\u2019t stay in Bei Zhou, why did you come to Xi Qi? Using the guise of Lian gongzi to get close to the empress. Say, should we tie you up and bring you to the office of justice to let them investigate you carefully? Or is it that you came here this time because of some secret mission?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was standing in the shade. Her clear voice reached Jin Mo\u2019s ears, making him stumble for a moment and almost fall from the sky. Very good! It\u2019s really very good! Not only did she point out his identity, now she was also make him wear such a big hat.</p><br/><p>Wearing a big hat: putting a big accusation on someone. MQQ is accusing him of doing a secret mission in Xi Qi</p><br/><p>Who didn\u2019t know that strange doctor Jin Mo is Bei Zhou\u2019s Nan Lin wang Feng Cang\u2019s subordinate. Him appearing in Xi Qi and also coming in contact with Xi Qi country\u2019s empress, everyone would think that there was some secrets here, some conspiracy.</p><br/><p>This woman was really good at playing politics. It was entirely killing without seeing blood\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji also understood Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words. Especially when thinking about that Nan Lin wang Feng Cang of Bei Zhou who had the name of \u2018demon wang\u2019, the two\u2019s heart trembled. Their attacks became more vicious.</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji deserved the title of the younger talents of Xi Qi country. Li Yun Qing was good at attacking. His weapon was a green jade flute plus he was wearing light colored clothes. Looking at him, he looked more like an immortal.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Wu Ji came from a family of generals. With just one attack, you\u2019ll be able to see solid basic skills. His pair of tiger iron fists, Murong Qi Qi could totally imagine what the outcome would be if they landed on Jin Mo\u2019s face which was refined as a precious jade.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo felt his figure had never been so sorry before. First, he was attacked by Murong Qi Qi. His belly had a not deep nor shallow wound that kept bleeding and now he is being attacked by two level seven experts, making his situation even more difficult.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that damned Murong Qi Qi seemed to have put a drug on the dagger. Jin Mo felt the wound becoming numb. His body is also becoming unconscious. His hand movements gradually slowed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2019.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo\u2019s back has eaten Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s fists.</p><br/><p>Damned woman! In order to stop this drug from making him lose consciousness, Jin Mo tore the already bandaged wound. Blood flew out again. The pain shocked him, making him more awake. Jin Mo had some regrets. He should\u2019ve listened to Feng Cang and shouldn\u2019t have underestimated this woman! A woman who entered Feng Cang\u2019s eyes, how could she be an ordinary woman\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The three fighting in Duanmu residence had alerted Duanmu Lei and Duanmu Qing. When she learned that the man who had come today wasn\u2019t strange doctor Lian gongzi but Bei Zhou\u2019s evil doctor Jin Mo, Duanmu Qing paled.</p><br/><p>Just now, Jin Mo had checked her pulse. The secret of the mother of a country being unable to get pregnant was now known by a person of another country, this was really shameful! Immediately, unprecedented disgrace entered Duanmu Qing\u2019s heart. This man couldn\u2019t be left alive, he must die!</p><br/><p>\u201cCome people, kill this thief of Bei Zhou for bengong5!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Benwang: this king, I used by the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer to a famous unmarried man</p><br/><p>3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>4. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>5. Bengong: this palace, I used by the females of the imperial family</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Seeing that everyone was now believing her, Fei Cui deliberately raised her head to show everyone the fingerprints on her face.</p><br/><p>On her pale skin, the red fingerprints could be clearly seen. It\u2019s just that the two thumbs on the fingerprints were pointing down. With one look, you could tell that she had done it herself. At this point, the servants began to believe Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that what third miss had said is the truth! Didn\u2019t think that Fei cui is actually such a person! Third miss is already miserable enough, Fei Cui still framed her like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, ah! Could it be that second miss is teaching Fei Cui like this in private? She really wants to be Jing wangfei1? The big sister wants to steal the little sister\u2019s husband, really shameless, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven in the presence of third miss, she was saying things like that, really too daring!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Fei Cui know that when Su Mei slapped her, she already used a trick? And at this moment, seeing everyone talk bad about her, Fei Cui could only look at Murong Xin Lian for help.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, it\u2019s really her who beat me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui, kneel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s words also went into Murong Xin Lian\u2019s ears. She didn\u2019t think that Fei Cui was so stupid and nearly ruined her plan.</p><br/><p>No matter what, just now Fei Cui\u2019s \u2018rubbish\u2019, everyone had heard it. At this time, if she didn\u2019t punish Fei Cui, everyone would think that it was her who was behind all of this and made Fei Cui act so arrogant. For her reputation, she could now only throw away the soldier (pawn) and defend the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui didn\u2019t know what had happened. Why was there such terrible coldness in Murong Xin Lian\u2019s eyes?</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, I\u2019m innocent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel down! Apologize to third miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s clenched fists were hidden in her sleeves. The nails had pierced her delicate arms. This Fei Cui was really unable to accomplish anything but liable to spoil everything.</p><br/><p>No matter what had happened today, the image that she\u2019d used so much effort to maintain was now damaged. It seemed that if she wanted to block everyone\u2019s mouth, she must heavily punish Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, Fei Cui was wrong\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that Murong Xin Lian was angry, Fei Cui stiffly knelt in front of Murong Qi Qi. Although she was dissatisfied, but she had to admit that now she\u2019s in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsking third miss to forgive this slave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui, knowing that she was wrong, still did that. Punish her with twenty wooden slaps and deprive her of half-year salary. Third little sister, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>In ancient china, while being punished, the guilty one will need to lie down and receive beatings with a thick wooden stick.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to speak, Murong Xin Lian directly said Fei Cui\u2019s punishment.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked at this pair of master and servant acting, but she didn\u2019t point it out. Instead she pleaded: \u201cSecond big sister, isn\u2019t such a punishment too heavy? On Fei Cui\u2019s body, there are still wounds. Her head is still bleeding. She needs to see a doctor. Moreover, after all, she has followed you for so long. Even if she didn\u2019t make any contributions but she still worked hard\u2026\u2026I think, punish with ten wooden slaps. The remaining ten wooden slaps, remembering it is enough. As for the salary, one month is enough. Second big sister , what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018plea\u2019 was to everyone\u2019s surprise. They originally thought that third miss would not be lenient and would punish Fei Cui heavily. How would they know that she would open her mouth to plea for Fei Cui?</p><br/><p>At this time, the image of third miss immediately rose in everyone\u2019s heart. Twenty wooden slaps on a weak girl, even if she was strong enough to accept it, but she would need to lie down for quite a while. And although half a year salary was not much, but to servants it\u2019s a big part of their income.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss really has a good heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight ah. Fei Cui framed third miss. Third miss didn\u2019t hold grudges. She really has a good heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s good brought out Murong Xin Lian\u2019s \u2018viciousness\u2019. The maid who\u2019d followed her so long, with just one word would be beaten. A comparison between the two misses, who is good and who is bad, the servants of the mansion now made a new assessment.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, do it according to little sister has said! When she is back, big sister will surely teach her well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Murong Xin Lian hated Murong Qi Qi to death. The truth was what she said. Now the one who opened her mouth to plead was also her. Murong Xin Lian struggled for so long, in the end, just because of some sentences from Murong Qi Qi, everyone had changed their views and even felt that she, this second miss was harsh.</p><br/><p>Endure! Endure! Murong Xin Lian restrained the hate in her heart. She revealed a smile: \u201cLittle sister, admiring the moon at the pavilion tonight, you must come, ah! See it as big sister\u2019s apology to you. You must give face, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Thanks big sister, little sister will certainly be on time!\u201d</p><br/><p>A farce ended with Fei Cui suffering ten wooden slaps.</p><br/><p>At Ou Xiang yuan2, Fei Cui was lying in bed. She\u2019d just suffered ten wooden slaps. Even moving a bit would be very painful.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, this slave, really didn\u2019t say those words. It\u2019s third miss who has framed this slave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian personally rubbed medicine for Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see her for five years, third little sister had actually improved. Fei Cui, rest assured. This hate of today, I will surely get it back for you! Just wait and see! Tonight, I\u2019ll let her regret everything she has done today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being Murong Xin Lian\u2019s confidante, Fei Cui also knew what she and Zheng Min were planning. Hearing Murong Xin Lian saying that, Fei Cui revealed an ugly smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, what you said is right. Endure for the time being. After tonight, making it so that she can\u2019t even cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui\u2019s words obviously made Murong Xin Lian happy.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi, you wait! After tonight, your reputation will be ruined! The status of Jing wangfei that you were relying on would be a thing of the past. Only I, Murong Xin Lian, am the best candidate to be Jing wangfei. You don\u2019t deserve it!</p><br/><p>Night.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi went to the pavilion. The pavilion was located at the west side of the prime minister\u2019s mansion. She didn\u2019t even arrive when she heard a burst of laughter coming from the pavilion. From the noise, Murong Qing Lian\u2019s voice was the loudest: \u201cDuanmu big sister, is what you said true? Is that demon wang3 really so dreadful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s true. He is cursed and caused the death of his eight wives! I heard that those women had died miserably. They suddenly died on the wedding night and the blood of their bodies had been drained! Everyone said that it\u2019s demon wang who had sucked the blood of the bride. He needs to marry a bride every year to take the fresh blood to maintain his life\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really frightening, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the young maidens in the pavilion exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about this anymore. Too scary!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian saw Murong Qi Qi. She immediately greeted her warmly: \u201cThird little sister, you\u2019ve arrived. Why don\u2019t you come here?! Come, everyone is waiting for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to second big sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi let Murong Xin Lian hold her hands and went into the pavilion.</p><br/><p>Aside from Li Yun Qing whom she had already met, the young masters and misses of the four great families were all here. Bai family\u2019s brother and sister, Bai Mu Fei and Bai Yi Yue, Duanmu family\u2019s brother and sister, Duanmu Hong Chen and Duanmu Yi Yi and Shangguan family\u2019s Shangguan Wu Ji. Even Murong fu\u2019s4 only son Murong Jun was here.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Murong Xin Lian has a wide range of friends!</p><br/><p>During the five years that Murong Qi Qi had been absent, Murong Xin Lian used much effort to befriend the children of the four great families. Who in the capital didn\u2019t know that Murong fu\u2019s second miss was an outstanding beauty?</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian was entertaining everyone as though she was Murong fu\u2019s legitimate miss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you call this ugly duckling here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun strongly disapproved of this little sister. The moment he\u2019d opened his mouth, \u2018ugly duckling\u2019 cursed out.</p><br/><p>1. Wangfei: the main wife/consort of the prince of first rank </p><br/><p>2. Yuan: part of a residence</p><br/><p>3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>4. Fu: mansion/household</p><br/>\n</div>"}

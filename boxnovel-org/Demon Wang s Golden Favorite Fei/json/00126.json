The way he looked at Murong Qi Qi also became gentler. It seemed that many years ago, Ming Yue had also dressed like this and stood in the plum blossom garden very beautifully. Until now, he was unable to forget it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, ah! Ming Yue likes plum blossoms the most\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying this, Wanyan Lie\u2019s voice had a trace of loneliness in it, surprising Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Why, whenever he mentioned Wanyan Ming Yue, Wanyan Lie\u2019s tone sounded so sad? She\u2019d heard that when Wanyan Ming Yue was alive, this big brother loved her very much and wished to get the stars from the sky for her. If this love was real, then why would Wanyan Lie plan that matter of Yandang mountain? Why did he plot against the husband and wife, Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue? And why did he put all hatred on Feng Cang?</p><br/><p>This man was full of complex contradictions. In the end, what kind of secrets were there?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seeing Murong Qi Qi staring at him, Wanyan Lie smiled gently. Wanyan Ming Yue was the number one beauty of the world; as her big brother, when Wanyan Lie was young, he was also a handsome man. Even now, though he had become old, but his bearing was still out of the ordinary and didn\u2019t show an old state.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, I like this Long Autumn palace very much. In the future, I will come here often.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Wanyan Lie\u2019s mood very good. He wanted to tell his good news to Ming Yue immediately; to let her know that he\u2019d found her daughter, that he\u2019d found her baby!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stayed for a long time in Long Autumn palace. Wanyan Lie accompanied by her side. He introduced everything of Long Autumn palace to her. When they arrived at the place where Yue Lan Zhi had previously lived, Murong Qi Qi discovered that this place had been sealed off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it was bad luck, so zhen1 let people seal it. Anyway, this place is big. You could choose any place you like and live there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d Murong Qi Qi nodded. She turned and looked at the yellow seal on the red door. Then, she left Long Autumn palace with Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>Although, she\u2019d entered the palace this time because of Lin Ke Xin\u2019s invitation, but in the end, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t talk much with Lin Ke Xin. After she\u2019d left Long autumn palace, she had been sent out of the palace by Wanyan Lie. Feng Cang heard that Murong Qi Qi had returned to the wangfu,2 so he didn\u2019t say anything further and also left.</p><br/><p>And Wanyan Lie\u2019s actions made Lin Ke Xin\u2019s heart feel even more uneasy.</p><br/><p>What did the emperor mean? She (MQQ) was obviously someone she\u2019d invited, but she\u2019d only stayed for a short time in her Jingxin hall. She (LKX) didn\u2019t even had time to let Wanyan Yi and Murong Qi Qi cultivate feelings before she (MQQ) was taken away by Wanyan Lie. Later, he\u2019d even personally let Jing De send Murong Qi Qi back to the wangfu.</p><br/><p>Could it be that her Jingxin hall was a place with severe floods and fierce beasts? Was he worried that she would swallow Murong Qi Qi? Or was it that the emperor had other thoughts?</p><br/><p>Severe floods and fierce beasts: extremely dangerous or threatening</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin wondered about the emperor\u2019s thoughts for a long time. In the end, she concluded that in Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart, the position of crown prince was still unshakeable. Wanyan Lie had seen through her plan. Although he didn\u2019t say anything, but he directly blocked the interaction between Wanyan Yi and Murong Qi Qi. Was this not obviously showing that he was helping Wanyan Hong?</p><br/><p>It seemed that she needed to use some unscrupulous means! Instantly, Lin Ke Xin thought of Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang had seemed very close with Murong Qi Qi. Since the emperor wanted to obstruct, then don\u2019t blame her for using another way to achieve her purpose! This throne is her Yi er\u2019s!3 Only her Wanyan Yi was the most suitable candidate for that position!</p><br/><p>After she had been sent back to Nan Lin wangfu, Murong Qi Qi saw two acquaintances as soon as she\u2019d entered. One was Longze Jing Tian. The other was Bai Yi Yue. Murong Qi Qi was somewhat surprised at the appearance of these two.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Murong, are you really general Feng Xie and princess Ming Yue\u2019s daughter?\u201d Seeing that unfamiliar face, Bai Yi Yue couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. After hearing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s story, Bai Yi Yue had the feeling of being deceived.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t guess the complex feelings in Bai Yi Yue\u2019s eyes nor understand them. It was just, why was the thing called \u2018hate\u2019 in Bai Yi Yue\u2019s eyes?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lied to me!\u201d The voice of the always gentle like water Bai Yi Yue rose. Her tone became sharp, \u201cI saw you as my good friend. I didn\u2019t think that you would actually lie to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Yue, I also just recently found out about it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to listen!\u201d Bai Yi Yue roared this sentence. She fiercely glared at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face, \u201cI was blind and took a wrong friend! In the future, you are no longer my friend! I\u2019m also unworthy to associate with princess Zhen Guo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving this sentence behind, Bai Yi Yue ran out of Nan Lin wangfu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Yue!\u201d Murong Qi Qi wanted to chase after her, but as soon as she left the place, she saw that there was no longer any trace of Bai Yi Yue. Murong Qi Qi was very worried about her. She saw Ruyi nearby and immediately stopped him, \u201cRuyi, help me protect miss Bai! I am afraid that she will do something foolish!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Bai Yi Yue\u2019s situation, Ruyi nodded and went to search for Bai Yi Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why miss Bai was like that?\u201d Longze Jing Tian came up behind Murong Qi Qi. Seeing her worried face, he explained, \u201cYi Yue (Remembering Yue), Yi Yue; when miss Bai\u2019s father named her, in his heart, he was thinking of another woman. That person was your mother, princess Ming Yue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Longze Jing Tian said this, Murong Qi Qi understood. She remembered those words Bai Yi Yue had said on the sixth test in the pagoda.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, is mother really just that woman\u2019s substitute? Yi Yue, Yi Yue, could it be that father really couldn\u2019t forget that woman named Ming Yue? Father, mother waited for you so many years, why are you so cruel? Actually, daughter hates the name Yi Yue very much, because daughter\u2026feel heartache for mother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So, it was like this. Murong Qi Qi finally understood. No wonder when Bai Yi Yue looked at her, her eyes were filled with hate. Presumably, she was crying injustice for her mother!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you. Don\u2019t blame yourself. Miss Bai is a sensible person. She would understand!\u201d After seeing that Murong Qi Qi really cared about this friend Bai Yi Yue, Longze Jing softly comforted at her side.</p><br/><p>I hope so\u2026Murong Qi Qi was thinking in her heart. She regarded Bai Yi Yue as her true friend and didn\u2019t want to lose her. She didn\u2019t want to become like this and let the grievances of the parents affect their friendship.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was Ruyi who would take care of her. Presumably, nothing would happen to Bai Yi Yue in the meantime. Murong Qi Qi felt slightly more at ease. She looked at Longze Jing Tian, \u201cJing wangye, why did you come today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI especially came to show my gratitude to princess for saving my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian\u2019s words were vague. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t understand. Seeing that she didn\u2019t comprehend his words, Longze Jing Tian reminded her, \u201cBack when I was being chased, it was princess who\u2019d saved me. That time, princess said that you\u2019re Du Xian Er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Hearing Longze Jing Tian had brought up the past, Murong Qi Qi chuckled, \u201cIt was only a slight effort, wangye4 shouldn\u2019t be concerned about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough in princess\u2019s heart, it was only a trivial matter, but benwang5 had always put princess in my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian stepped forward and caught the scent of the green apple fragrance coming from Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body. His heart was immediately moved. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t miss her! Fortunately, he didn\u2019t give up! Fortunately, they still had a chance\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes wangye intend to repay me?\u201d Murong Qi Qi took one step to a side. She didn\u2019t like people getting so close to her, aside from Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018withdrawal\u2019 made Longze Jing Tian laugh bitterly in his heart. It seemed that he\u2019d offended her very badly in the past. So, now she didn\u2019t even want to give him any chance. \u201cIt\u2019s me, I want to repay princess. I just don\u2019t know how to show my gratitude!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery simple! Firstly, bengong6 likes money. Although in the past, wangye has indeed given me gold. But, if five hundred thousand made wangye feel that it didn\u2019t match your status, you could add more money. Secondly, bengong is tired and wants to sleep. Troubling wangye to go back. Bengong needs to go get my lost sleep back!\u201d</p><br/><p>These two points blocked Longze Jing Tian\u2019s mouth completely. He thought that the debt of gratitude would be repaid with the flesh. He thought that since Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang had no chance, he could take advantage of this opportunity and marry Murong Qi Qi. He didn\u2019t expect that the other party would only have two requirements: one was money, the other was f*** off. This woman really didn\u2019t give him face.</p><br/><p>\u201cXian Er\u2026\u201d Seeing that Murong Qi Qi had turned and wanted to leave, Longze Jing Tian reached out and grabbed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wrist. \u201cXian Er, give me one more chance, alright? Originally, you were engaged to me. Originally, you would\u2019ve been my wangfei!\u201d7</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d Murong Qi Qi wanted to take back her hand. She didn\u2019t expect that Longze Jing Tian\u2019s hand was like shackles and firmly locked her in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Longze Jing Tian gritted his teeth and looked at that beautiful face of Murong Qi Qi. \u201cBenwang once let go and almost let benwang brush past the love of benwang\u2019s life. Now, benwang has finally gotten the opportunity. This time, benwang absolutely won\u2019t let go, absolutely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Longze Jing Tian to finish, a figure in white appeared in front of him. The next moment, Longze Jing Tian felt pain in his lower abdomen. He was directly sent flying with a kick. With a \u2018boom\u2019 sound, he fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cServants, close the door, let the dogs out\u2026\u201d Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s waist and looked coldly at Longze Jing Tian. He only came a bit late. He didn\u2019t expect that such a big and stinky fly would appear. He (LJT) actually touched Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wrist! This is his! His!</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian clutched his abdomen and painfully curled on the ground. He didn\u2019t think that Feng Cang would appear so suddenly. He also didn\u2019t expect that Feng Cang\u2019s kick would be so powerful. A piercing pain came from his abdomen. That kick had been really strong.</p><br/><p>Now, Feng Cang said \u201cClose the door, let the dogs out\u201d; what did Feng Cang take him for?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, are you leaving by yourself or do you want us to shoo you away?\u201d Feng Qi led a group of people towards him and they all surrounded Longze Jing Tian. Everyone glared at Longze Jing Tian, and if he\u2019d said, \u201cI won\u2019t leave\u201d, they would be very willing to lift him up and throw him out.</p><br/><p>A country\u2019s wangye being thrown out; how shameful would that be?! Longze Jing Tian struggled and stood up by himself, \u201cBenwang will leave by myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he stepped out of wangfu, Longze Jing Tian turned once more to look at Murong Qi Qi, \u201cXian Er, I won\u2019t give up! I definitely won\u2019t let go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out\u2026\u201d There was obviously anger in Feng Cang\u2019s voice. His tone reached Longze Jing Tian. It made his ears feel a piercing pain. Longze Jing Tian quickly clutched his ears. How sorry his figure could be, was how sorry his figure was now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang\u2026\u2019 Not waiting for Longze Jing Tian to take a breath, Nan Lin wangfu\u2019s entrance closed with a bang. He was thoroughly closed out and couldn\u2019t see Murong Qi Qi\u2019s figure again.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t give up! You\u2019re mine! I won\u2019t give up! Longze Jing Tian clenched his fists and fiercely turned back. He looked back once again at the red door. Murong Qi Qi was the bride he\u2019d set his eyes on. He won\u2019t give up. He would never give up!</p><br/><p>Inside Tingsong building, Feng Cang was full of vinegar. He bit Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ear like an angry little animal and vented the dissatisfaction in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, there\u2019s really nothing between us. You have to believe me!\u201d The warmth from her ear made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s whole body feel itchy. She quickly dodged his bite.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! You call him wangye. You also call me wangye. I don\u2019t even know which wangye you\u2019re calling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang put his arms over each other and pouted angrily. The originally almost transparent face, because of anger, had become red like an apple, making people couldn\u2019t help but want to kiss that face.</p><br/><p>And that pair of devilish beautifully eyes were now full of fire. At his Qing Qing\u2019s side, there were so many flies. The big one called Longze Jing Tian actually chased her to the wangfu and also grabbed her wrist. How could he not be angry?!</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was arrogant and lovable. Murong Qi Qi could only go to him and give him a superficial kiss on the face. \u201cHow about I call you something else? What do you like? For example, Cang, Cang Cang, little Cang Cang, beloved, darling, baby\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Only when Murong Qi Qi recited a series of nicknames, did Feng Cang\u2019s face become a bit better, \u201cIn any case, I don\u2019t want a popularized nickname! Lest I couldn\u2019t tell if you\u2019re calling me or calling Longze Jing Tian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang saying this, let Murong Qi Qi know that he truly was angered by Longze Jing Tian\u2019s matter. She didn\u2019t expect that when this man is jealous, his temper was really bad. However, getting jealous meant that he cared about her. This was something to be happy about. When a man didn\u2019t care about you anymore, no matter what you do, even if you eloped, he wouldn\u2019t have an opinion!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang clapped at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s suggestion, \u201cGreat! I heard that Moyu is the best at assassinations. Qing Qing, why don\u2019t we ask Moyu\u2019s killers to kill Longze Jing Tian? What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang mentioned Moyu, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but twitch a while. What did Feng Cang hear? Could he know that she\u2019s Du Xian Er? If he knew that she\u2019s that killer who was like a serpent from those rumors, what would he think?</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, don\u2019t kill him. After all, he\u2019s still in Bei Zhou. If something happens to him, Xi Qi would certainly make trouble for Bei Zhou.\u201d Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to speak, Feng Cang immediately changed his opinion and kindly left Longze Jing Tian\u2019s life intact.</p><br/><p>Just when Murong Qi Qi was thinking about why Feng Cang had changed his attitude, Feng Cang\u2019s chin was on her forehead, \u201cQing Qing, your heart can only have me, do you know that?! Just the thought of you falling in love with another, makes my heart feel pain as though a dagger was carving it. Qing Qing, you\u2019ve already become a part of my life. If I lose you, I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These words of affection were what Murong Qi Qi wanted to say, but unexpectedly, Feng Cang said them first.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, I won\u2019t fall in love with another, because you\u2019ve already filled my heart and nobody else could enter it.\u201d To this point, Murong Qi Qi could only use such words to express her heart. And the firmness in her watery and full of feelings eyes, made Feng Cang\u2019s worried heart gradually calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, it\u2019s good\u201d Feng Cang closed his eyes and kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Feng Cang summoned Nalan Xin to the study.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, go investigate wangfei\u2019s identity.\u201d The moment Nalan Xin entered, Feng Cang threw a piece of paper at Nalan Xin. After reading the contents, Nalan Xin frowned, \u201cWangye, you\u2019re saying that wangfei may be Moyu\u2019s Du Xian Er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirstly, go investigate Longze Jing Tian. He was once running away from an assassination. Go investigate who\u2019d saved him. If it was Du Xian Er, then Du Xian Er is wangfei.\u201d The moment he thought about what he heard during the day, Feng Cang\u2019s heart would feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>If Murong Qi Qi was Du Xian Er, then it could explain why every time Guanghua gongzi8 would stake (bet) a thousand pieces of gold on one throw on Murong Qi Qi\u2026</p><br/><p>Stake a thousand pieces of gold on one throw: throw away money recklessly.</p><br/><p>The rumors of the jianghu9 were that Du Xian Er and Guanghua gongzi were a couple. If Murong Qi Qi was Du Xian Er, then who was Guanghua gongzi? What was their relationship? If they really are lovers, then what should he do?</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t dare to think further. Ever since he heard that Murong Qi Qi was Du Xian Er, his heart hadn\u2019t yet calmed down.</p><br/><p>In Feng Cang\u2019s heart, the probability of Murong Qi Qi being Du Xian Er was very high. Du Xian Er was very good at using poisons and Murong Qi Qi was Lian gongzi; being able to save people was also being able to kill people. Those who were proficient in medicine were also proficient in poisons; this matched like a puzzle. Besides, Du Xian Er was beautiful like a fairy, that was why she got the name \u2018Xian Er\u2019. And how could Murong Qi Qi\u2019s outstanding appearance be described with only \u2018Xian\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>Du Xian Er: Du = poison, Xian= fairy/immortal/goddess, Er= term of endearment</p><br/><p>If it was determined that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity was Du Xian Er, then wouldn\u2019t it mean that he had a strong rival\u2026Guanghua gongzi?</p><br/><p>The work efficiency of Fu Sheng Men was very high. That night, Nalan Xin returned with the answer. Sure enough, the one who had saved Longze Jing Tian was Murong Qi Qi. Besides, it was because of Du Xian Er that Longze Jing Tian had broken off the engagement and split with Murong Qi Qi. It was just, that fool didn\u2019t know Murong Qi Qi was Du Xian Er. Now that he found out, he regretted it. That\u2019s why he\u2019d come to look for Murong Qi Qi and continue their fate once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, what should we do?\u201d Seeing that Feng Cang\u2019s face changing from black to white and white to black, Nalan Xin was a bit nervous. Usually, such a situation indicated that master\u2019s mood was very bad and that someone would die. He didn\u2019t know who that unlucky person was.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut down Guanghua gongzi\u2019s Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai!\u201d Feng Cang commanded this order with gritted teeth. I don\u2019t care who you are! You dare to fight with me over Qi Qi; I will let you regret coming to this world!</p><br/><p>1. Zhen: I, used by the emperor</p><br/><p>2.

Why such a stunning woman appeared in this deserted mountain was something no one knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d1</p><br/><p>Compared to Wu Ji Gong\u2019s people, the people under Longze Jing Tian were calmer. Lu Yuan and the other three people protected Longze Jing Tian in a circle. Seeing his expression turning worse by the minute, Lu Yuan\u2019s heart burst in anxiety. Time was limited, they couldn\u2019t delay longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Longze Jing Tian\u2019s reinforcement?\u201d</p><br/><p>As a woman, seeing another woman who was a thousand times more beautiful than herself made Jue Sha very unhappy. One foot struck at Mei Sha who was still in a daze and she glared fiercely at the woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young woman in white smiled. From behind her, another sound of breath being inhaled was heard.</p><br/><p>It seemed that she could no longer use this face to meet people. Sooner or later, this face would bring trouble to her! The young woman in white regretted that when she came out, she didn\u2019t wear the \u2018Water Moon Mirror\u2019. She could\u2019ve used it to cover her peerless looks. Then she wouldn\u2019t have these people\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p> Water Moon Mirror is like a mask which can seal her original face and give her a normal-looking face</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! No matter who you are, since you are here, you have to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sounds of breath being stopped just now, gave Jue Sha more unhappiness. She thought that she was really beautiful. She didn\u2019t expect that this woman in white would steal the limelight. Women\u2019s jealousy was like a venomous snake, hovering around Jue Sha.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to that, the young woman in white felt like laughing. She ignored these people and walked to Lu Ye who had just been poisoned. She feed him a pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong ago, I heard that Wu Ji Gong\u2019s Jue Sha\u2019s speciality is poison, however it seems just so-so.\u201d</p><br/><p>During the moment that she was speaking, Lu Ye\u2019s face turned a lot better.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking miss for your help!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ye cupped his fists as a way to say thanks and walked with difficulty to Longze Jing Tian\u2019s side. Like everyone else, he protected Longze Jing Tian in a circle.</p><br/><p>After seeing that this woman could actually cure her poison, Jue Sha was absolutely shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young woman in white frowned and thought for a moment. Then she softly answered Jue Sha: \u201cIn the jianghu,2 they call me Du Xian Er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Xian Er? The moment they heard this name, the people who had been indulging in the beauty of the young woman in white, immediately paled. Longze Jing Tian was also shocked.</p><br/><p>Legend had it that Du Xian Er\u2019s looks could shake the heavens but she\u2019s vicious and merciless. The moment she takes action, no one would live. Some people say that she\u2019s the pearl of that old poisonous fart of Moyu. She had debuted only three years ago, but was now famous over all the jianghu. Although not many people had seen her; the ones who had were all dead.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t expect that the woman with such vicious methods according to the rumors, turned out to be such a beautiful woman.</p><br/><p>Her exquisite body was wrapped in those white clothes. A pair of white jade-like feet gently stepped on the grass. Those feet were flawless like they had been carved out by the world\u2019s most skilled person. They were only as big as a man\u2019s palm size, making people want to play with them in their hands.</p><br/><p>This young woman looked innocent and faultless like a fairy. Where can it be seen that she even had half a relation with poison?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour subordinates are really loyal!\u201d</p><br/><p>The frightening and flustering of the people in black were within the expectations of the young woman in white. She was too lazy to bother with them. The young woman in white turned around and looked at Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>So, it turned out that this is Jing wang Longze Jing Tian, ah! Not to mention, this person had an arranged marriage with herself. But looking at his sorry state, the young woman in white felt like laughing.</p><br/><p>Just now, she had talked about this person with Su Mei. Didn\u2019t expect that talking about caocao, caocao will come, but they met under such circumstances.</p><br/><p>Talk about caocao and caocao will come: talk about the devil and the devil will appear</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that what kind of master would have what kind of servants. It appears that your personality is not bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just now, he only saw the young woman in white\u2019s slim figure, but from the expression of the other people, Longze Jing Tian concluded that this woman was a rare beauty.</p><br/><p>But now being face to face with her, Longze Jing Tian discovered that using \u2018beauty\u2019 to describe her was not perfect; for her, you could only use \u2018capable of causing the downfall of a land\u2019 to convey the meaning.</p><br/><p>A strange feeling suddenly filled Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart. When meeting her eyes, Longze Jing Tian clearly heard his heart beat faster with \u2018pu\u2019 sounds. He must get this woman!</p><br/><p>The young woman in white didn\u2019t know that Longze Jing Tian had set his eyes on her. She threw him a pink pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a beautiful scene. Its quietness has been scrambled by them. Really makes people upset. This miss hasn\u2019t used her hands for quite a while. I\u2019m afraid that they have turned rusty. Need to occasionally practice. Longze Jing Tian, why don\u2019t we make a deal? If you give me money, I\u2019ll kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the young woman in white\u2019s words were sudden, but Longze Jing Tian still nodded. Her voice calling his name was really pleasant to hear, just like how he imagined.</p><br/><p>With their present condition, unless reinforcements arrive, it\u2019ll be really difficult to escape from here. Instead of putting hope on the unknown, he might as well grab on this straw of grass in front of him. Perhaps, this Du Xian Er was the savior that heaven sent to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlatly, five hundred thousand silver.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, they\u2019re surrounded by so many killers, but the young woman in white didn\u2019t seem to have put them in her heart. Instead, she started to do business in front of them, making the people in black a little terrified.</p><br/><p>So many people, in the young woman in white\u2019s mouth, it was just like bargaining dishes. It seemed that in the girl in white\u2019s eyes, they were not killers but just a business.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><br/><p>An ivory dragon-shaped jade flew from Longze Jing Tian\u2019s hand and fell into the young woman in white\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my keepsake, miss can come any time to Jing wangfu3 to get the money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStraightforward, I like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young woman in white put away the jade. The arc of her mouth is growing upward. Don\u2019t know when on her wrist appeared a pair of golden bracelet. On each bracelet hung five thumb sized gold bells.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeizing Soul Bell? That old poisonous fart actually passed this thing to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jue Sha and Mei Sha are shocked after seeing this scene. Jue Sha paled. Mei Sha\u2019s expression changed greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ah! Dad said that two bastards stole his poison book, betrayed Moyu and dirtied the door of Moyu. He said if I meet them, I must help him clean the door. Very unfortunately, today it was you who came at the point of my sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young woman in white\u2019s word made Mei Sha\u2019s heart tighten. Twenty years ago, they were only two disciples of Moyu\u2019s Sir Mozun. Taking advantage of Mozun practicing with the door closed, they stole his poison book and poisoned a few other disciples. Nearly causing Mozun to let his fire enter the demons and finally destroyed half of Moyu.</p><br/><p> : the literal meaning is fire entered your demons. It\u2019s a saying used when someone is obsessed with practicing martial arts that they get side- effects.</p><br/><p>These two people fled out of Moyu and established Wu Ji Gong. Although so many years have passed, Moyu didn\u2019t cause trouble for Wu Ji Gong, but they are still very afraid of that old poisonous fart.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t expect that the old poisonous fart adopted a daughter and also passed his secrets to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, don\u2019t be afraid! Today, that old poisonous fart isn\u2019t here. With only a liar little girl, she can do nothing to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jue Sha gritted her teeth to comfort Mei Sha. It was just, although she was saying that, but the cold sweats on her forehead were dripping down. Even she herself wasn\u2019t aware of the fear that the young woman in white bring to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on the young woman in white\u2019s face paused. The golden bells on her hands made some sounds.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for people to understand what was happening, ten golden threads flew out from the bells. Like ten golden snakes they flew from her hand. A burst of sweet flower fragrance emerged. The fragrance shrouded the people in black. Before they had the chance to scream, they fell lifelessly on the ground.</p><br/><p>Really powerful poison! Longze Jing Tian\u2019s eyes turned deeper.</p><br/><p>With only a moment of effort and before people understood, the people who just now yelled that they want Longze Jing Tian\u2019s life, fell on the ground. The corpses rotted into water. The air was filled with a faint fragrance of flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they done like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The scene in front of him left Lu Yuan stunned. Those vicious killers, in front of the young woman in white, they were like cotton. What kind of situation was this?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Yuan\u2019s silly words, made the young woman in white smile amused.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake your master and go! In the future if you see me, hide! Remember to take the antidote. Next time you won\u2019t have such good luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Lu Yuan to understand her words, the young woman in white jumped into the sky, stepped on branches and flew out of their sight like a butterfly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally good qinggong4!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian words just fell, when he felt his chest turn stuffy. A black blood rushed to his lips. With a \u2018pu\u2019 sound, he spit it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Yuan just now remember the pill that the young woman in white gave them. Could it be the antidote? But this antidote came from an unknown origin, how could he let wangye take it?!</p><br/><p>Just as Lu Yuan was hesitating, Longze Jing Tian put the pill in his mouth and swallowed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Yuan was startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Du Xian Er won\u2019t harm me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian said this just because of his intuition, but he had won this bet. Sure enough, not long after, he felt better. It seems that this Du Xian Er was quite someone. She could poison and she could cure poison. But just thinking about how those living people turned into water just now, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart sank.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Yuan, benwang 5 wants to know every information of Du Xian Er! If she really come to wangfu to get the money, be sure to find the place where she lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye\u2019s meaning is\u2026\u2026this woman can\u2019t stay?\u201d (He means that this woman can\u2019t be left alive)</p><br/><p>Lu Yuan hesitated for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! This Du Xian Er is really to benwang\u2019s taste. Benwang, has decided to marry her as consort!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not to mention her power with poison, even with her beauty alone, in this world no man wiould not be tempted.</p><br/><p>Just thinking about the young woman in white\u2019s small size jade like feet, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart turned hot. This woman is his! No matter if it\u2019s the body or the heart, he will get it!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut wangye, don\u2019t you already have an arranged marriage\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention that rubbish from Murong family! This time when benwang go back, I\u2019ll break the engagement!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the guards\u2019 escort, Longze Jing Tian left here. After he left, the young woman in white appeared. The moon fell on the girl rose like lips. Like petals, it opened: \u201cLongze Jing Tian, so you hate me this rubbish from Murong family so much, ah?! Wants to break the engagement? Good! Very good! This miss will help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Wangye/wang: the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Jianghu: the world of martial arts</p><br/><p>3.

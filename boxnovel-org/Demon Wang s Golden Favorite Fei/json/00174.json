Her fingers trembled slightly, \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to be Dong Lu\u2019s citizen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial grandmother, don\u2019t get angry!\u201d Xia Zheng quickly poured tea for Jun Lan Xin and gave her another round of shoulder massages. This made Jun Lan Zin\u2019s anger calm down, \u201cSince you all want the throne, but have no way to convince the other, then hand this matter over to heaven!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Lan Xin had no way to deal with these few imperial grandsons. She could only let people bring five tortoiseshells with pennies in them and put them in front of everyone. \u201cThe one who could divine the greatest luck using the divine trigram is the new emperor of Dong Lu and can also lead everyone to defeat Bei Zhou and restore the glory of before!\u201d</p><br/><p>The so-called greatest luck is all the five copper coins in the tortoiseshell land on the \u2018Yang\u2019 side. The recommendation of the empress dowager got the five princes\u2019 agreement. Since no one could convince the other, then give the choice of destiny to God.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuang, kuang, kuang\u2026,\u201d Eldest prince Xia Qi rocked the tortoiseshell first. \u2018Hualala\u2026.,\u201d sounded. The three of the five coins on the ground were positive, two were negative and this led to a sigh. The next one was Xia Yu. One positive and four negative. Third eldest brother got four positive and one negative.</p><br/><p>When it was fourth brother\u2019s turn, he closed his eyes and prayed for a long time. Then, he finally blew in the tortoiseshell. \u2018Kuangdang\u2026.,\u201d five positive copper coins appeared on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be? Why was it like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The result of Xia Zheng\u2019s divination let the princes and the officials debate. Some, who were licking the boots, immediately kowtowed and shouted long live for ten thousand years.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, this is impossible!\u201d As soon as Xia Qi\u2019s hands was about to touch the copper coin, Jun Lan Xin shouted, \u201cDo you want to go against god\u2019s wishes? Or is it that you want to suffer the wrath of heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Lan Xin\u2019s words successfully scared Xia Qi. A mortal\u2019s heart revered the gods. Besides, they\u2019d already agreed that the one who could divine such a result would be the new emperor. Now, even if the other princes were not willing, they could only drop this matter.</p><br/><p>With Xia Zheng\u2019s greatest luck, fifth prince hadn\u2019t divined yet, but he was already ignored by the others. The original problem about the new emperor had been tangled for so long and was now solved by a small divination. Although the other princes were unwilling but just now, everyone had recognized this approach. Now, Xia Zheng had really divined the greatest luck. If they oppose and by chance, they angered the gods, then it would be troublesome.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a \u201cSir Duyi has arrived!\u201d spread over.</p><br/><p>The one who came was a man about thirty years old. He was dressed in black and had a dark aura around him. The moment Duyi arrived, he first smilingly congratulated Xia Zheng, \u201cCongratulations Your Majesty! Congratulations Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Duyi!\u201d Xia Zheng grinned from ear to ear. \u201cThank you, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two talked politely for quite a while, making Xia Qi unable to look at it any longer, \u201cSir Duyi, may I ask when will the reinforcement of Penglai Island arrive? It has been so long, why hasn\u2019t there been any news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to talk about this! I\u2019ve just received a letter from Penglai Island. Master had sent one hundred supreme disciples of Penglai Island and they\u2019ve already embarked on the boat. Soon, they will reach Dong Lu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duyi\u2019s words let the hearts of the people, who had been worried about the demise of Dong Lu, settle down a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, ah?! Right, ah?! With Penglai Island stepping in, we will certainly beat that Feng Cang and let him be gone forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right, right! Every one of Penglai Island\u2019s disciples is a master at martial arts. They could simply take Feng Cang\u2019s head at the battle. By then, even if didn\u2019t want to retreat, they would have to retreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Before, it was said that Bei Zhou\u2019s regent Long Ao Tian would go to battle. I thought that a new character had appeared. I didn\u2019t think that it was Feng Cang. Although Feng Cang is a young god of war, but behind our Dong Lu is Penglai Island! Penglai Island is not something Feng Cang can afford to provoke!\u201d</p><br/><p>A storm about succession was calmed down by just five copper coins.</p><br/><p>Although Feng Cang\u2019s army was approaching, but the people of Yuchu\u2019s palace didn\u2019t seem to be aware of the imminent danger. Everyone pinned their hopes on the hundred Penglai Island\u2019s disciples Duyi talked about.</p><br/><p>Because of the war and the lack of time, the ascension of the new emperor of Dong Lu wasn\u2019t as lively as in the past. But even so, it was extravagant. In the morning, Xia Zheng received the officials\u2019 worshipping and also issued the first edict after the ascension. It was to make the other four princes become wangye,1 built residences for them in the capital and ordered that they could not leave the capital without permission.</p><br/><p>Xia Zheng being like this attracted the anger of the four princes, \u201cHim doing this, isn\u2019t it like holding us captive?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Xia Zheng had long known that his brothers wouldn\u2019t readily accept this request. He didn\u2019t wait for them to resist and let people forcibly imprison them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Duyi, thank you for giving zhen2 advice. Zhen salutes you with a cup of wine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the harem, Xia Zheng, who\u2019s wearing the dragon robe, was beaming. Duyi also laughingly took the cup of wine and drank it in one shot, \u201cWasn\u2019t this because Your Majesty is the true son of heaven?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Duyi say that, Xia Zheng took out the previous tortoiseshell and poured the coins out. \u201cNo one would believe that the two sides of these coins are the same. If it wasn\u2019t because sir Duyi came up with the plan to use divination to determine the heir to the throne, zhen wouldn\u2019t have this day! So, zhen still needs to toast with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two drank a whole earthen jar. When Xia Zheng was drunk, Duyi let people escort Xia Zheng to his chambers to rest. He went to empress dowager Jun Lan Xin\u2019s palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuyi, how is it? Do Penglai Island intend to help us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He changed his relaxed expression of before. Duyi\u2019s face turned gloomy. \u201cNow, master is in seclusion. Without eldest senior\u2019s order, no one would listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When mentioning eldest senior Misha, Duyi felt endless resentment. Obviously, he was older than Misha, but he had to call Misha eldest senior. Also, master gave Misha the power when he went into seclusion. This was obviously being biased!</p><br/><p>Earlier, Misha had rushed to Bei Zhou. Although Duyi didn\u2019t know why he went to Bei Zhou in such a hurry, but he (D) grabbed the chance. He imprisoned all those disciples in Dong Lu who were biased to Misha.</p><br/><p>Now, the imperial family of Dong Lu only recognized him Duyi. This let the gratification in his heart expand eagerly. However, after that, Bei Zhou invaded. Feng Cang led the eagle troop and took up two thirds of the city with irresistible force. Everyone in Dong Lu wanted him to ask for help from Penglai Island. This forced Duyi back to his original place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why is it like this? Where is Misha? Did you find him?\u201d The moment she heard that Penglai Island didn\u2019t send people to help, Jun Lan Xin got anxious. \u201cThen all the things you had said before were lies? Why did you lie to everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress dowager!\u201d Duyi\u2019s face was gloomy. \u201cWasn\u2019t I afraid to let the popular sentiment be in disorder?! If I say that no one from Penglai Island would be coming as reinforcement, then wouldn\u2019t the whole capital been in a mess a long time ago?! My eldest senior went to Bei Zhou and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s dead or alive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh god!\u201d After listening to Duyi, Jun Lan Xin felt dizzy. \u201cCould it be that the heavens want to let my Dong Lu perish?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress dowager, I already let people go find eldest senior and I also let people go to Penglai Island. Don\u2019t worry, nothing will happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was saying that, but in fact, Duyi told people to kill Misha without pardon when they find him. He had been pushed around for so long by Misha. Finally, he had found the chance to blow off the steam; how could he let Misha appear and take away his limelight?!</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing will happen?! When you let the emperor mobilize the army, you also said that, but what was the result? In the end, the emperor died. The general also died. Now, Dong Lu is about to perish. You still say nothing will happen? How can you let me be assured?! If by chance Dong Lu perishes, when I die, how will I go face Dong Lu\u2019s ancestors?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Lan Xin\u2019s noisiness made Duyi annoyed. He went forward and covered her mouth, \u201cEmpress dowager, is it that you want this thing to get out, let everyone know that Penglai Island won\u2019t help, let the court be at unrest and let the capital become a mess? You want to die, but I don\u2019t want to die! There\u2019s nothing to be afraid about that Long Ao Tian. Give me twenty thousand people. I will personally lead the soldiers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only when Duyi said that did Jun Lan Xin\u2019s heart calm down. Anyhow, Duyi was Penglai Island\u2019s second disciple. No matter what, he is also capable! In only a moment, Jun Lan Xin agreed to Duyi\u2019s request and gave him twenty thousand of Dong Lu\u2019s elite soldiers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Duyi, zhen awaits you good news!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duyi departed with the army. Xia Zheng personally sent him off. After drinking Xia Zheng\u2019s wine, Duyi smashed the cup on the ground. The whip pointed to the west, \u201cDepart!\u201d A mighty twenty thousand people and horses followed Duyi to the northwest.</p><br/><p>After Duyi travelled seven days on the road, two people arrived at Yuchu palace\u2019s entrance. The woman carried a pale faced man on her back. \u201cGo, tell your emperor that Penglai Island\u2019s grand disciple ask for an audience!\u201d</p><br/><p>The soldier was only a small character. He had never heard about the name Misha. However, the loud name \u201cPenglai Island\u2019 made it so that he couldn\u2019t ignore it. He immediately went in to inform.</p><br/><p>Not a while later, someone came to meet them. When Xia Xue carrying Misha appeared, the two\u2019s sorry figures made Jun Lan Xin and Xia Zheng startled for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Give me some food first. Also, I want clean clothes and a place to wash myself.\u201d Misha sat on the chair with a look full of fatigue. Not waiting for Xia Zheng to open his mouth, Misha ordered first.</p><br/><p>The feeling of being ordered seemed very bad and also very uncomfortable. However, because Misha was Penglai Island\u2019s grand disciple and there were a lot of things that needed Penglai Island\u2019s help, Xia Zheng didn\u2019t express his emotions. Instead, he let the palace servants go prepare.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, quickly get everything ready for sir Misha! Quickly, quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also need a wheelchair. My wheelchair got broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes! Quickly go get a wheelchair!\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking a bath and being satiated, Misha got into his new wheelchair, \u201cI will sleep first. Before I wake up, sort out all the information about the front. I will look at it when I wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha \u2018blatantly\u2019 went to rest, leaving Xia Zheng, whose face was full of gloominess.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial grandmother, would he really do well? Looking at his appearance, could he be a swindler?\u201d The moment Misha left, Xia Zheng complained to Jun Lan Xin. Seeing her grandson\u2019s face full of grievances, Jun Lan Xin laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, he\u2019s indeed Misha. Don\u2019t look at his paralyzed legs. He\u2019s very tremendous! Now, with Misha, aijia3 really doesn\u2019t have to worry and can sleep with a peaceful mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Lan Xin, who had been alarmed and frightened by Duyi, after Misha\u2019s arrival, she was finally relieved. With Misha here, as long as he writes a letter to Penglai Island, Penglai Island would certainly come help them!</p><br/><p>Of course, Xia Zheng didn\u2019t know that Duyi couldn\u2019t invite Penglai Island\u2019s disciples. Now, after seeing Jun Lan Xin speak for Misha, Xia Zheng was a bit dissatisfied, but he didn\u2019t say anything. He only smilingly let people escort Jun Lan Xin back to the palace and waited for Misha to wake up before making a decision.</p><br/><p>After Jun Lan Xin left, Xia Zheng kicked the stool in front of him. \u201cHumph! What kind of thing does he think he is? He actually dared to command zhen! Who does he think he is?! Bastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the sake of the overall situation, zhen would\u2019ve long dragged off this cocky bastard and cut off his head!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Xia Zheng could only say these complaints behind his (M) back. The enemy was in front. He could only ask help from Penglai Island.</p><br/><p>When Misha woke up, it was already night. After reading all the conditions of the war, Misha said, \u201cNot good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xia Zheng frowned, \u201cSir Misha, what do you mean by \u2018not good\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m afraid Duyi\u2019s twenty thousand men would be gone forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is unlikely\u2026,\u201d Xia Zheng frowned. \u201cNo matter what, sir Duyi is Penglai Island\u2019s second disciple. Zhen believes in his ability\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Zheng didn\u2019t finish speaking, when someone hurriedly came forward and handed Xia Zheng the battle report of the front.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuang\u2026\u2019 After reading the contents of the report, Xia Zheng\u2019s hands became unstable. The battle report fell onto the ground. \u201cLet me see!\u201d Misha reached out. Xia Xue handed the battle report to Misha.</p><br/><p>The content of the battle report made Misha\u2019s words came true. Duyi was indeed defeated. His head was severed before the army by Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHim again!\u201d Seeing Feng Cang\u2019s name, Misha clenched his fist. The injured left eye began to hurt. Sure enough, this man had some ability. Misha somewhat knew the ability of Duyi. The two armies had fought. Duyi had actually lost to Feng Cang within a hundred strokes. This Feng Cang is really too powerful!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do, ah? What to do?!\u201d Xia Zeng cried in panic. \u201cHe\u2019s coming! He\u2019s approaching the capital! Zhen doesn\u2019t want to die, zhen doesn\u2019t want to die!\u201d Xia Zheng kept repeating. He also panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Servants, servants!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPack up things. We\u2019ll go to the south. Quickly let people pack things up and go to the south!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Zheng\u2019s action undoubtedly was to abandon the capital and flee. He hadn\u2019t competed with Feng Cang yet, but already wanted to give up the capital. Xia Zheng was probably the first emperor of Dong Lu\u2019s history who was a deserter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you can\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s words came from behind Xia Zheng. \u201cYou\u2019re an emperor of a country. How can you leave Yuchu at this moment and abandon the capital?! The soldiers at the frontline are striving and fighting at close quarters. You doing this, wouldn\u2019t this make people be bitterly disappointed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Misha\u2019s words irritated Xia Zheng completely, \u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re here talking about some nonsense, you can! Because if Bei Zhou\u2019s people captured you, they wouldn\u2019t do anything to you! But what about zhen? If by chance, zhen falls in their hands, then it would be like living is more painful than death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I should also \u2018thank\u2019 you Penglai Island\u2019s people. If it wasn\u2019t because of Duyi\u2019s instigation, zhen\u2019s imperial father wouldn\u2019t have lost his mind and go fight Bei Zhou! Now, it\u2019s great. Something bad happened and I don\u2019t see your Penglai Island\u2019s people coming to help! Now, you\u2019re criticizing zhen. What qualifications do you have?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you talking about?!\u201d Seeing Xia Zheng\u2019s attitude towards Misha was so bad, Xia Xue was very angry. Her hands were on the hilt of her sword. She looked coldly at Xia Zheng. \u201cIf you have the guts, say it once again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf zhen say it, what can you do to zhen? Could it be that you want to kill zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Zheng looked sinisterly at Xia Xue, \u201cZhen remembered now. When Duyi instigated for imperial father to mobilize the army, you, Misha went to Bei Zhou. It couldn\u2019t be that you and Bei Zhou ganged up against our Dong Lu, right?! Right, it must be like this! You two operated separately. One let us mobilize the army and fight Bei Zhou. The other made a pact with Bei Zhou. The motive is to topple our Dong Lu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking till here, Xia Zheng suddenly \u2018realized\u2019. He pushed everything that had happened to Dong Lu onto Misha, Bei Zhu and Penglai island. \u201cZhen served you with good meat and wine. It turns out that you\u2019re the culprit behind the scenes! Servants, capture them for zhen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Just when Xia Zheng commanded people to arrest Misha and Xia Xue, Jun Lan Xin rushed over. \u201cEmperor, what are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial grandmother, zhen feels that everything that has happened to Dong Lu is their fault!\u201d Xia Zheng pointed at Misha, \u201cZhen feels that this is Penglai Island\u2019s plot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Seeing Xia Zheng being so ignorant, Jun Lan Xin got a headache because of anger, \u201cEmperor, what time is it? Don\u2019t make any more scenes! If we still have an internal strife in front of the enemy and let Bei Zhou know, then wouldn\u2019t it be a joke on us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Lan Xin was now the grand empress dowager. She also had some prestige at court. Xia Zheng had just ascended the throne. On a lot of things, he still need to depend on this imperial grandmother. So, now that Jun Lan Xin spoke, Xia Zheng endured this and didn\u2019t talk back. \u201cAnyway, no matter what, zhen has to leave Yuchu! It\u2019s no longer safe here. Zhen doesn\u2019t want to become a destroyed country\u2019s emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Lan Xin couldn\u2019t oppose Xia Zheng\u2019s decision. Seeing that the new heir of Dong Lu was like this, Misha couldn\u2019t help but sneer.</p><br/><p>He had rushed all the way here and arrived covered in dust. Originally, he wanted to reverse the situation. He didn\u2019t expect that Xia Zheng was actually such a bastard. He had seen the battle report. This Feng Cang was determined to win Dong Lu. However, with only his (M) strength, it\u2019s impossible to reverse the situation. Moreover, he was confronted with such a muddle-headed emperor. It would be more difficult to win Feng Cang and to drive Bei Zhou out. Besides, he also didn\u2019t want to help Xia Zheng.</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Misha opened his mouth slowly, \u201cAfter I studied the battle report, I discovered that Bei Zhou had pulled their battle line very long. If Feng Cang continues to go forward in such a hurry, the battle line would become elongated and it would be difficult to supply the army provision, the ones who would suffer would be them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue!\u201d Jun Lan Xin quickly told Xia Zheng to be quiet and listen to Misha\u2019s opinion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who provides the army provision for Bei Zhou is princess Zhen Guo Feng Qi Qi. Everyone in Bei Zhou knows that princess Zhen Guo and the regent are a couple. Now, Feng Qi Qi is at Min province. We can send a cavalry to Min province. Firstly, we can burn the army provision and leave Feng Cang without a thing to rely on; secondly, we can capture Feng Qi Qi and use her to threaten Feng Cang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCapture Feng Qi Qi to threaten Feng Cang? Do you think Feng Cang is stupid? Give up the country for a woman? If it was you, would you be willing?\u201d Xia Zheng disdained Misha\u2019s proposal very much.</p><br/><p>1. Wang/wangye: first-rank prince</p><br/><p>2. Zhen: I, used by the emperor </p><br/><p>3. Aijia: I, used by an empress dowager</p><br/>\n</div>"}

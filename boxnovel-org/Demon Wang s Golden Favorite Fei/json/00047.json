She would\u2019ve let the hand Feng Cang loves so much go greet his devilish beautiful face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye1, is it not better if you go change clothes\u2026 \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi wiped off the rice on Feng Cang\u2019s face, the soup on those white clothes couldn\u2019t be removed.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi wiped it for quite a while before finally giving up. She hanged her head guiltily like a child who did something wrong and was waiting to be scolded by an adult.</p><br/><p>That look was so well behaved and so cute, making Feng Cang really happy. Then he looked at his clothes. It\u2019s indeed dirty.</p><br/><p>If it was a normal day, Feng Cang would\u2019ve long gone to change his clothes, but today\u2019s different. Murong Qi Qi was still here. Besides, the people here were not easy\u2026 \u2026Thinking till here, Feng Cang asked Murong Qi Qi in a low gentle voice: \u201cQing Qing, is it alright if I leave for a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it alright?\u201d It\u2019s not asking Murong Qi Qi if he can leave, but it\u2019s asking Murong Qi Qi whether or not she can deal with the situation.</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang being so careful, Murong Qi Qi finally revealed her first sincere smile of the day: \u201cIt\u2019s not like wangye wouldn\u2019t come back. I will wait for you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>A \u2018I wait for you\u2019 made Feng Cang\u2019s heart jump. So having someone waiting for you is so wonderful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me!\u201d Feng Cang pressed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand. He stood up, swept his gaze over the crowd. His gaze especially stayed on Longze Yu Er, making her tremble.</p><br/><p>Knowing that Feng Cang was worried that while he\u2019s absent, Longze Yu Er would make trouble for her, hence the glaring, Murong Qi Qi was somewhat touched.</p><br/><p>So far, the care that this man has shown her was not fake. If his concern is false, then he can simply go and be an Oscar winner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang, under the guide of servants, went to a side hall to change. The atmosphere at the Hall of Supreme Harmony became more lively because of his departure.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t see Feng Cang scold Murong Qi Qi, some people felt slight regret. They were hoping to add salt to the wound. Shortly afterwards, dancers came up. The scene became bustling again.</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian\u2019s gaze seemed to always be falling on Nan Feng\u2019s princess Ming Yue Xin, making Murong Xin Lian, who\u2019s sitting next to him, feel sour. She\u2019s now more sure that Longze Jing Tian had taken a fancy to Ming Yue Xin and she\u2019s also more uneasy and worried about her future.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a moment, Murong Xin Lian finally stood up. She\u2019s the number one beauty in the capital and her talent is also outstanding. She can\u2019t be pressed down like this by Ming Yue Xin. She must also show people her dance skills and attract Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian volunteering to dance made Longze Yu very happy. Ming Yue Xin\u2019s dance was superb. Xi Qi country couldn\u2019t do a bad job compared to Nan Feng country.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhen2 gives permission!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Xin Lian dance, both Duanmu Qing and Murong Xue Lian revealed a mysterious smile. Two pair of eyes closely watched Murong Xin Lian\u2019s belly. They didn\u2019t even leave for a second.</p><br/><p>Although knowing that she\u2019s pregnant and needed to rest, but now in the moment between life and death, Murong Xin Lian didn\u2019t want to give up the position of wangfei3 like this. She\u2019s gambling, gambling with the child in her belly. If she loses the child, but get Longze Jing Tian\u2019s favor, get the position of wangfei, then why shouldn\u2019t she do it? If the child is alright and she can be wangfei, then that\u2019s even better!</p><br/><p>Child, mother\u2019s future is relying on you now. You must live up the expectations, ah! When she got on the scene, Murong Xin Lian gently touched her lower abdomen.</p><br/><p>This action went into Longze Jing Tian\u2019s eyes. He sneered. This woman must\u2019ve become crazy from wishing for power! In order to chase fame and fortune, she even gambled her child\u2019s life. To this child, having such a mother is simply the saddest thing\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After seeing such action from Murong Xin Lian, Longze Jing Tian couldn\u2019t help but think about his own mother consort Xian He Xin Er.</p><br/><p>He Xin Er has passed away for many years, but her voice and expression remained in Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart. In the past, the imperial physician diagnosed that her body was too weak to have children, but after getting pregnant, she insisted on letting the child be born. That\u2019s why there\u2019s Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>Although for the next five years, He Xin Er spent her days in bed because of a too weak body and she also lost Longze Yu\u2019s favor because of this, the love she had for Longze Jing Tian was the greatest and the most selfless. Even at the time when she had to leave this world, she didn\u2019t forget to request Longze Yu to look after Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>Compared with He Xin Er, Murong Xin Lian doesn\u2019t even have the right to be a mother! She also isn\u2019t qualified to be a mother! Longze Jing Tian humphed coldly. In his heart, he has long sentenced Murong Xin Lian to death.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian couldn\u2019t fathom Longze Jing Tian\u2019s mood. Her body swayed according to the music. She danced Xi Qi country\u2019s national dance\u2014-picking tea dance.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s dress was too gorgeous. It didn\u2019t express the meaning of the dance very well, but her dance was quite good. After all, for the title of the number one beauty, she also paid a lot of hard work. No matter if it\u2019s the qin skills or the dance skills, she had intensive training.</p><br/><p>The people who knew that Ming Yue Xin came here to form a marriage alliance with Longze Jing Tian, after seeing Jing wang ce fei\u2019s4 performance, all knew what was going on. This ce fei must not be willing for the position of Jing wangfei to be taken away by another woman, that\u2019s why she wanted to compete with Nan Feng\u2019s princess.</p><br/><p>It seems that there will be a good show again! Those spectators, who had lost their hearts just now because of Murong Qi Qi, revived again. Don\u2019t know who will be the final winner after this. Many people secretly compared the two in their hearts.</p><br/><p>As for the involved party Ming Yue Xin, at this moment, her attention was stuck on Murong Qi Qi. Compared to Longze Jing Tian, she\u2019s now more interested in Feng Cang. And Feng Cang\u2019s future wangfei Murong Qi Qi has now become Ming Yue Xin\u2019s rival.</p><br/><p>In just a moment, Ming Yue Xin got to know about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018glorious past\u2019.</p><br/><p>Humph! Just a rubbish who was pushed forward as the \u2018scapegoat\u2019. What right does Murong Qi Qi have to compete with her?</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin doesn\u2019t believe that Feng Cang would chose a rubbish as wangfei and that he isn\u2019t tempted by her, a princess of a country! Men love country and love beauty. Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t compete with her on beauty. Her (MQQ) family background is even more incomparable with hers (MYX). This bet, she will definitely win!</p><br/><p>However, Ming Yue Xin is more cautious than Longze Yu Er. Just now, everyone saw Feng Cang\u2019s care towards Murong Qi Qi. She can\u2019t be too rash, lest she would end up like that stupid Longze Yu Er who hasn\u2019t even gambled yet, but has already lost from the start!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ming Yue Xin\u2019s mind is full of thoughts on how to grab Feng Cang\u2019s attention and how to get his favor. She didn\u2019t even care about Murong Xin Lian and also put all the words that He Lan Min had told her before she came here at the back of her mind.</p><br/><p>After Murong Xin Lian stopped while panting, Longze Yu was the first to clap.</p><br/><p>\u201cAward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu seemed very happy.</p><br/><p>A \u2018award\u2019 made Murong Xin Lian felt that she had already won half of it. The remaining half must rely on luck! She couldn\u2019t help but glance at Longze Jing Tian. The first thing she wants to know is if he\u2019s satisfied with her performance.</p><br/><p>Wangye/ wang: prince of the first rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>Zhen: I, used by an emperor \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wangfei: main wife of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wang cefei/ cefei: ssecond ranked wife of a wangye</p><br/>\n</div>"}

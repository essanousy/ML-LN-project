It even rolled a few times and became contaminated with dust. It also left a bright red trail of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! They killed someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>A person in the crowd watching from afar saw this bloody scene, screamed and fainted.</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er and Murong Xin Lian saw this scene, and they almost vomited.</p><br/><p>Then, a burst of hooves was heard. Ten black armored soldiers on tall horses appeared in front of Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cSubordinates came late to the rescue, asking wangye for punishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wangye? Which sort of wangye is he? Longze Yu Er\u2019s brain hadn\u2019t gotten far when a string of shrill voices was heard. All the heads of the forty people who had surrounded Feng Cang reached the ground. Red blood sprayed onto Longze Yu Er\u2019s face. She was so afraid that she began to scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s voice was trembling. Her whole body also began to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are Nan Lin wang\u2019s eagle troup!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone in the crowd saw the eagle head embroidered on the sleeves of the soldiers riding the horses and they immediately recognized the symbols.</p><br/><p>Nan Lin wang? Not only Longze Yu Er, everyone else present was in shock. That man in white with the gauze hat is the rumored Nan Lin wang Feng Cang? Is he the Nan Lin wang who people called the \u2018God of War\u2019 and who became famous throughout the four countries at just the age of fifteen?</p><br/><p>A gust of wind blew. It wanted to lift up the white gauze hat to let people see Feng Cang\u2019s looks, but just as a perfect chin was exposed, Feng Cang stopped it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After his identity got exposed, Feng Cang chuckled. He pulled the gauze down over his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cRu Yi, if someone wanted to murder benwang2 in Bei Zhou, what kind of sin is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering wangye, murdering an imperial family, the punishment is death on the spot and the execution of nine generations!</p><br/><p>Ru Yi\u2019s voice is very loud. When it reached Longze Yu Er\u2019s ear\u2019s, it\u2019s very piercing. Long has she heard that Nan Lin wang\u2019s acts are out of ordinary. He is reckless. She didn\u2019t expect that he would dare to kill Xi Liang\u2019s imperial guards!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you don\u2019t come over\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who was just now so arrogant, and showed her strength by wanting to rob the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 in Feng Cang\u2019s hands, her two rows of teeth were now beginning to tremble. She actually forgot that Bei Zhou\u2019s missionaries had arrived at Xi Liang. Besides, Feng Cang had also brought along Bei Zhou\u2019s most elite eagle troup. The behavior of just now was simply seeking death!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 indeed is very beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang opened the wrapping of the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019. Under the sunlight, the dress sparkled. The picture on the golden gauze came alive, making everyone who saw it surprised. They forgot about the bloody scene that had just occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 \u2026,\u201d, Feng Cang\u2019s voice changed. \u201cOnly benwang\u2019s wangfei3 has the right to wear such clothes. Princess, could it be that you want to be benwang\u2019s wangfei?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Longze Yu Er\u2019s vision was completely attracted by the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019. She didn\u2019t pay any attention to Feng Cang\u2019s words. It was only because of Murong Xin Lian pulling at her clothes that made her mind come back.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No! Bengong 4 doesn\u2019t have such thoughts!\u201d</p><br/><p>What a joke, letting her marry demon wang for a piece of clothing? She still wants to live a long life! The moment Longze Yu Er moved her legs, she fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, her courage is just like that\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang put away the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019. He no longer bothered with Longze Yu Er and Murong Xin Lian. Instead, he turned and cupped his hands in obeisance to Fang Tong: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for dirtying Jue Se Fang\u2019s store. Benwang will apologize to Guang Hua gongzi5 here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, no need. This is red for a good start! It\u2019s a good sign!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong\u2019s eyes took in all of Feng Cang\u2019s actions. In his heart, he\u2019s raising his thumbs up for this wangye. Presumably, only such a person could match with his miss!</p><br/><p>Fang Tong\u2019s words couldn\u2019t help but let Ru Yi look once more at this shopkeeper of Jue Se Fang. This person really was interesting. If it were anyone else, they would\u2019ve already been trembling with fright. He actually said that this is red for a good start. This Jue Se Fang\u2019s really interesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cShopkeeper has good measure! As for compensation, benwang will look after Jue Se Fang in the future! In the future, if someone comes searching for trouble at Jue Se Fang, then they are against benwang and is against benwang\u2019s eagle troup!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice is not loud, but these words reached everyone\u2019s ears. Jue Se Fang got Feng Cang as their backing, even if Longze Yu Er wanted to touch Jue Se Fang, she wouldn\u2019t be able to\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Understanding that Feng Cang is protecting Jue Se Fang, Fang Tong bowed to Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>In just one afternoon, Nan Lin wang Feng Cang and the matter of Feng Cang cutting off the heads of the imperial guards spread throughout Xi Liang. At the same time, inside Cui Zhu yuan6 Murong Qi Qi also received the dress and jewelries Feng Yu brought in. It was as she had guessed. It\u2019s \u2018Autumn flower\u2019 and \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Feng Yu is a middle-aged woman, after seeing these things, she couldn\u2019t seem to put them down. She couldn\u2019t help but say in admiration: \u201cIf given the chance, I really want to see that Guang Hua gongzi! How fine a person can be to have such an exquisite heart to be able to design such beautiful ornaments!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Feng Yu said that, Su Mei and Su Yue only laughed. The Guang Hua gongzi everyone is searching for is precisely Murong fu\u2019s7 third miss, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cZeze, princess, look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yu carefully picked up golden crown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful, ah! Really beautiful. Princess, you will become the most beautiful person at the banquet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s indeed very beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t show much happiness like Feng Yu. Such stuff, she can get it just with a movement of her fingers. It\u2019s her own design. She has long become bored from touching it.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s plain expression made Feng Yu love this future wangfei even more. If it\u2019s an ordinary girl, seeing Tong Bao Zhai\u2019s jewelries, she would surely be tempted. This princess Zhao Yang remained unaffected. Really a posture of someone grand! She is well matched with wangye!</p><br/><p>At the palace, right at this moment, Longze Yu Er is kneeling in front of Longze Yu. Duanmu Qing is exculpating for her daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu looked at Longze Yu Er with some hate for iron not becoming steel.</p><br/><p>Hate for iron not becoming steel: feel resentful/resentment</p><br/><p>\u201cAnybody else you mess with would be alright. You actually go provoke that bad star?! Could it be that you don\u2019t know his rumors? How come I gave birth to such a stupid daughter?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, appease your anger! This time, Yu Er really did wrong, but Feng Cang shouldn\u2019t have killed inside the capital, ah! This is Xi Qi country, it\u2019s Xi Liang. It\u2019s not their Bei Zhou! Who gave him the gall?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing knew that this wasn\u2019t Longze Yu Er\u2019s fault. It would have been alright if she had stolen someone else\u2019s dress. So you can\u2019t blame her for stealing from Feng Cang. Feng Cang didn\u2019t say his identity. In short, it\u2019s Feng Cang\u2019s fault!</p><br/><p>Hearing Duanmu Qing say such \u2018bad words\u2019, Longze Yu\u2019s finger pointed towards the sky. He didn\u2019t know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid! She is stupid, why do you follow her and also become stupid?! Is Feng Cang someone to mess with? Not mentioning the killing of forty people, if he wanted to hold Yu Er accountable for today, zhen8 will not protect her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, you being like this, is it not like letting another\u2019s backbone be more impressive than yours?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing is somewhat dissatisfied with Longze Yu\u2019s fuss. The other party is just a wangye of different surname. How could he be more noble than the emperor of Bei Zhou?</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s surname is Feng. The imperial family of Bei Zhou\u2019s surname is Wangyan. Most of the time, the title of wangye is bestowed on the princes of the imperial family. A wangye of a different surname usually has a lower status than those with the imperial family\u2019s surname.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot! Zhen wondered why Yu Er is so stupid, it\u2019s because she has such a mother as you! You think well about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu swung his sleeve and left Qing Luan Palace.</p><br/><p>1. Wangye/wang: prince of the first rank</p><br/><p>2. Benwang: I, used by a wangye</p><br/><p>3. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye</p><br/><p>4. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imeperial family</p><br/><p>5. Gongzi: young master/ also used to describe a famous unmarried man</p><br/><p>6. Yuan: a part of a residence</p><br/><p>7.

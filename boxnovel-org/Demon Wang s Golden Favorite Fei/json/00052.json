It seemed that Nan Feng really wants to change their crown prince, that\u2019s why this princess could act so brazen and speak like this towards Ming Yue Cheng in front of Xi Qi\u2019s people.</p><br/><p>When Murong Qi Qi\u2019s frown fell into Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s eyes, it made his heart feel warm. So many people, yet only Murong Qi Qi would frown because of Ming Yue Xin\u2019s words and feel wronged for him. So many people, yet only Murong Qi Qi would give him sincere encouragement and wouldn\u2019t look at him with different eyes.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know that just a casual frown would help this pitiful crown prince make the decision that he would strongly uphold for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng didn\u2019t speak, making Ming Yue Xin feel that he was in the wrong, so she also became triumphant.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin ordered the two palace maids to show her work to the crowd. She didn\u2019t believe that this girl\u2019s painting would be better than hers. She had started to learn painting when she was three. It\u2019s been thirteen years since then. The paints she used was able to let the river change colors. How could she be worse than Murong Qi Qi?!</p><br/><p>\u201cLook!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Ming Yue Xin\u2019s triumph to pass, someone pointed at the sky and shouted.</p><br/><p>A colorful cloud drifted down. Only when it came near, did the people realise that it was a group of butterflies. The one in the lead was a blood red butterfly.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s already autumn. Butterflies weren\u2019t common. Now so many butterflies had appeared and they were flying towards the paintings, making everyone surprised. What\u2019s happening? Could it be that these butterflies came for the paintings?</p><br/><p>The crowd hadn\u2019t yet understood the situation when the butterflies flew towards Murong Qi Qi. These little things landed on the chrysanthemum on the painting. Their small wings were twinkling and immediately, a \u2018miracle\u2019 appeared!</p><br/><p>Originally, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s painting only had ink color and blood color. Now because of these butterflies, the chrysanthemums were covered in colors.</p><br/><p>These butterflies had different colors and they landed on different chrysanthemum. Their wings glittered and it immediately became a live colored chrysanthemum painting. And that largest blood red butterfly landed on the biggest chrysanthemum in the center. The wings glittered under the sun and showed different kinds of colors.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue\u2019s \u2018how beautiful\u2019 voiced out the inner thoughts of everyone. Having seen so many paintings, but none were comparable to this \u2018live\u2019 painting.</p><br/><p>\u201cA miracle!\u201d</p><br/><p>An old official shouted. Then he knelt down and shouted: \u201cAuspicious sign from the heavens, bless my Xi Qi!\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing someone take the lead, immediately people knelt down and shouted \u2018ten thousand years\u2019. This boot-licking made Longze Yu smile look like a blooming chrysanthemum as if the painting was made by him. Now, Murong Qi Qi looked very pleasing in Longze Yu\u2019s eyes. He completely forgot about the bet. In a moment of impulse, he opened his mouth: \u201cZhen1 announces that Murong Qi Qi has won!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just some words made Ming Yue Xin\u2019s and Longze Yu Er\u2019s thoughts stop at a dead end. The two\u2019s faces immediately became greyish. Especially Longze Yu Er. Her own father said so, could it be that he really wanted her to gift her pair of hands to Murong Qi Qi?</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong2 refuses to accept!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin rushed over, took Murong Qi Qi\u2019s knife from the table and cut the painting into two.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ming Yue Xin take action against Murong Qi Qi, Ming Yue Cheng screamed. He wanted to rush to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side, but a man beat him to it. Not waiting for the dagger in Ming Yue Xin\u2019s hand to touch Murong Qi Qi\u2019s clothes, Feng Cang threw her away with a flying kick.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang!\u2019</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin\u2019s body hit the table like a broken kite. She immediately coughed blood. Seeing his empty arms, Ming Yue Cheng revealed a bitter smile. How could he have forgotten that Murong Qi Qi was already promised to Feng Cang?</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang embrace Murong Qi Qi, that woman was so near, yet he was unable to reach out his hand. It made Ming Yue Cheng feel hatred. He hated himself for being powerless, hated himself for not being able to protect her. Instead, he can only watch her go away with someone else\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Although knowing that nothing had happened to Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but beat faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, are you alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked at the butterflies lying on the ground that Ming Yue Xin had killed, and her heart felt some pain. She broke out of Feng Cang\u2019s embrace and walked towards the torn painting. She gently picked up the wings and cut up bodies of the butterflies and wrapped them carefully in a handkerchief.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been hard on you! I will take revenge for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi waved her hands at the butterflies in the air. They seemed to understand Murong Qi Qi, circled around her once, flashed their wings and then left.</p><br/><p>After doing all of these, Murong Qi Qi slowly walked towards Ming Yue Xin, making Ming Yue Xin very scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 \u2026 \u2026what do you want, want to do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are my stuff!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi picked up the dagger from the ground and carefully wiped the blood on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t come over! Imperial big brother, save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi getting closer and closer, Ming Yue Xin endured the pain in her heart and asked help from Ming Yue Cheng: \u201cBig brother crown prince, save, save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo late!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, she finally knew that Ming Yue Cheng was the crown prince, was her big brother and wants to get help from him? Murong Qi Qi smiled, revealing a row of white teeth. Step by step, she got closer to Ming Yue Xin, the dagger in her hands also slowly went up.</p><br/><p>The other party was obviously a small white rabbit, but it let Ming Yue Xin felt fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No! Big brother crown prince, save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin crawled on the ground and wanted to escape from here. She now knew what it meant to be afraid. She knew that Murong Qi Qi was not someone to make trouble with! However, it\u2019s too late\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026 \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the dagger in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s was about to go down, Feng Cang came up behind her. He took over the dagger and put Murong Qi Qi into his arms. Seeing that Feng Cang has saved her, Ming Yue Xin felt grateful. She has forgotten about that kick he had just given her. She looked smitten at Feng Cang: \u201cWangye3\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin thought that Feng Cang\u2019s heart was moved for her. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t bear to let her lose her pair of hands. So that\u2019s why he helped her. She didn\u2019t expect that the following words coming out of Feng Cang\u2019s mouth would be like a thunderbolt to her!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, such a thing, let me do it, lest it makes Qing Qing\u2019s hands dirty\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Ming Yue Xin to come out of her daze, a pair of jade hands got cut off at the wrist by Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Only a scream could be heard. Ming Yue Xin fainted from the pain and that pair of hands flew in the air, flew towards the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those who were watching saw those bloody hands flying towards them, and they dodged. In the end, the two hands fell on the ground and were contaminated with mud. The originally smooth surface became ugly because of the blood and the mud mixed together.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, what a pity\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was in shock, but Murong Qi Qi said it was a pity.</p><br/><p>The moment that Ming Yue Xin\u2019s hands were cut off, Feng Cang flew her away from the platform to avoid Ming Yue Xin\u2019s blood dirtying their clothes. And at this time, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018what a pity\u2019 couldn\u2019t help but make Ming Yue Cheng look at her once again. Could it be that she thought about Ming Yue Xin\u2019s backing, Nan Feng country, and was now regretting it?</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously on the body, it\u2019s very attractive. Why is it so ugly when cut off? Really a pity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice sounded faint. Ming Yue Cheng almost felt completely terrific\u2026 \u2026So this is what she felt pity for! This girl really is different, making it so that people couldn\u2019t help but love her.</p><br/><p>Zhen: I, used by the emperor \u21a9</p><br/><p>Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wangye/wang: prince of the first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

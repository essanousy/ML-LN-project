The way they looked at Murong Qi Qi became even stranger.</p><br/><p>\u201cServants, quickly bring princess Xin down for treatment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu was the fastest to recover from the shock.</p><br/><p>Nan Feng\u2019s princess\u2019s hands has been cut off in front of him. It happened so fast that he was too late to stop it, making Longze Yu\u2019s expression become very ugly. Just now, he was immersed in the happiness of \u2018good fortune from heaven\u2019, now he couldn\u2019t help but get a headache because of Ming Yue Xin\u2019s matter. If Nan Feng country asked for who was responsible, what should he do then?</p><br/><p>One side is the \u2018trying to form a marriage alliance\u2019 Nan Feng country, the other side is the arrogant Feng Cang with Bei Zhou glaring like a tiger behind him. Which side to choose is the problem that Longze Yu must consider now. A mere Nan Feng country, Xi Qi is not afraid of. But if this matter isn\u2019t handled properly, offending both sides; by then, the two sides put together will cause him many troubles.</p><br/><p>Longze Yu is considering about his country and empire. Longze Yu Er is thinking about how to keep her hands.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s means went into her eyes, fear into her heart. But still Longze Yu Er didn\u2019t come to her senses. She thought the reason Feng Cang\u2019s acting like this is because of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s provocativeness. So as long as she attacks Murong Qi Qi and let Feng Cang know about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018true colors\u2019, then she can be saved!</p><br/><p>Not having Ming Yue Xin as a competitor and also ruining Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reputation, then wouldn\u2019t the position of Nan Lin wangfei1 be hers, Longze Yu Er\u2019s?!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Longze Yu Er clenched her fists and took a deep breath. She tried to make herself look calmer and not to think of Ming Yue Xin\u2019s bloody hands anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cNan Lin wang2, bengong3 has something to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang carefully checked on Murong Qi Qi to see if anything happened to her. He simply ignored Longze Yu Er.</p><br/><p>The other party ignoring her made Longze Yu Er\u2019s expression turn very ugly. She hated Murong Qi Qi even more. Her voice also reached its highest pitch: \u201cNan Lin wang, you have been cheated by Murong Qi Qi! Not only is she a rubbish but she is also a thief. Stealing is her nature! She even stole her sister\u2019s glowing pearl. This is a matter that everyone knows about. Don\u2019t believe her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s words made Feng Cang raise his head. Seeing that he was looking at her, Longze Yu Er\u2019s heart sped up and she also became more excited. She must expose Murong Qi Qi and let Feng Cang know her true colors! She must save him and not let this bitch Murong Qi Qi bewilder him!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bengong said is true! You just arrived at Xi Liang and don\u2019t know about these matters. As long as you go out and just ask anybody, even if they are commoners, everyone knows about this shameful thing. She also has something going on with Lian gongzi4. They even have a child together! You must believe bengong. Every word bengong said is true. Bengong also has a witness!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Longze Yu wanted to die. Why is it that at this time, when he is under great pressure and wanted to calm things down, wanted to protect Longze Yu Er, this daughter seemed like she\u2019s out of her mind and would say such things? Could it be that faeces entered her brains? If Feng Cang finds out about this \u2018brilliant\u2019 past of Murong Qi Qi, the first one he would held accountable is Xi Qi country!</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er, shut up. Don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu really wanted to let someone seal Longze Yu Er\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father, why don\u2019t you let me say it? Today, I want to make all things clear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er completely disregarded Longze Yu\u2019s \u2018good intentions\u2019. She poured out all those bad rumors with added oil and vinegar.</p><br/><p>Add oil and vinegar: to exaggerate things</p><br/><p>Around them was a dead silence. Longze Yu Er\u2019s totally unaware that these words would cause much anger.</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing clenched his fists. Shangguan Wu Ji gritted his teeth and Longze Jing Tian was trying very hard to suppress his anger. If it wasn\u2019t because of his special identity, Longze Jing Tian would\u2019ve rushed forward and kicked her!</p><br/><p>As for Ming Yue Cheng, his pair of player\u2019s eyes turned increasingly cold and ruthless. How could he bear to hear such slander on Murong Qi Qi?</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess said so much, could it be that princess is jealous of princess Zhao Yang? Since princess said this with such detail, why don\u2019t you come out with evidence to let us be convinced?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t expect that the first one to open his mouth to protect her would be Ming Yue Cheng. She couldn\u2019t help but look at Ming Yue Cheng twice more, but she didn\u2019t know that her little actions made the person next to her become jealous.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I\u2019m still next to you and you\u2019re thinking about fondling the flowers and trample the grass?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fondle the flowers and trample to grass: to womanize. </p><br/><p>TL Note: A man womanizes, a woman\u2026 comment below if you know.</p><br/><p>Editor: There isn\u2019t a perfect equivalent but I\u2019d say any of these: \u2018temptress\u2019, \u2018coquette\u2019, \u2018manizer\u2019, \u2018player\u2019 or \u2018man-eater\u2019. </p><br/><p>Feng Cang really didsn\u2019t rest until he startles people. Longze Yu Er is spitting saliva in all four directions at the other side; he is here on this side, putting on a \u2018jealous husband\u2019 expression. Accompanied with that beautiful face, Murong Qi Qi almost lost her soul.</p><br/><p>Seeing that \u2018amazement\u2019 at the bottom of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes, Feng Cang finally smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m more handsome than him, Qing Qing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s actions inadvertently provoked Longze Yu Er, she rushed towards Murong Xin Lian and pulled Murong Xin Lian forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing wang\u2019s cefei5. is the witness! She previously witnessed with her own eyes how Murong Qi Qi stole imperial noble consort\u2019s glowing pearl. She is the witness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those \u2018gossips\u2019 she talked in her free time with Longze Yu Er, has been brought out by her. At this time, Murong Xin Lian is standing awkwardly there and accepted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial sister-in-law, say it! Quickly say that everything bengong said is true and expose her with bengong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Xin Lian didn\u2019t say anything, Longze Yu Er became anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial sister-in-law\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort, did you\u2026really\u2026saw\u2026with\u2026your\u2026own\u2026eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian is actually Longze Yu Er\u2019s \u2018partner\u2019, making Longze Jing Tian really angry. This bitch is really restless. It seems that he needs to remind her of her status.</p><br/><p>Although Longze Jing Tian used \u2018beloved consort\u2019, but Murong Xin Lian saw the disgust and coldness in Longze Jing Tian\u2019s eyes, making her shudder. Could it be that he misunderstood the closeness between Longze Yu Er and her? And thought that she is the empress\u2019 people? No, she isn\u2019t! She can\u2019t let Longze Jing Tian misunderstand!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Xin Lian hastened to deny that she saw anything, but she didn\u2019t want to offend princess Ping Yang, so she pushed all the fault onto the deceased Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my maid Fei Cui who saw it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where is Fei Cui? Let her come out to testify!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er was unwilling to let go of any opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian glanced once at Murong Qi Qi and put on a look of apprehension.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has already been murdered by princess Zhao Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having seen many shameless people, but never has once seen such a person without face or skin! Murong Qi Qi once again gave her complete admiration to Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, did you hear! She did something wrong and in order to hide it, she actually murdered someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er was very happy. This is great. Not only will Feng Cang be disgusted by Murong Qi Qi and the marriage will get annulled, she\u2019ll also have a lawsuit!</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial big brother, speak! What did you see on that day at Duanmu family\u2019s?! Isn\u2019t it right that you saw her and Lian gongzi do that dirty thing? That\u2019s why you wrote the \u2018breaking engagement\u2019 letter in anger? Nan Lin wang, don\u2019t you see? The woman you\u2019re going to marry is not only snake-hearted but she also had an affair with another man. She\u2019s a broken shoe that my imperial big brother didn\u2019t want! A broken shoe, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Broken shoe: loose woman</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d</p><br/><p>A roar made Longze Yu Er\u2019s ears in pain.</p><br/><p>Wangfei:main wife of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wang: prince of the first rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family \u21a9</p><br/><p>Gongzi:young master/ also used to refer to a famous man \u21a9</p><br/><p>Cefei/ce wangfei: second ranked wife of a wangye</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Jing wang1 Longze Jing Tian was 18 years. His consort mother was one of the four consorts, consort Xian, He Xin Er.</p><br/><p>An emperor can have four consorts: consort Gui, consort De, consort Shu and consort Xian</p><br/><p>Wei wang Longze Jing Ming was 12 years old. His consort mother was just an ordinary lady in waiting. Zhao wang Longze Jing Qi was 9 years old. His consort mother was consort De, Bai Meng Yu. Eldest daughter princess Ping Yang, Longze Yu Er was 15 years old. She was born from Duanmu Qing. Youngest daughter princess Xin Yang, Longze Jin Er was 3 years old. Her consort mother was Imperial noble consort Murong Xue Lian.</p><br/><p>That year when Duanmu Qing gave birth to Ping Yang princess, it was a difficult labor. With great difficulty, the mother and daughter were saved, but her body got hurt. Ever since then, she didn\u2019t become pregnant again. Not having a son was Duanmu Qing\u2019s biggest regret. Now the rumors of Longze Jing Tian becoming the crown prince were really popular, making Duanmu Qing feel a lot of pressure.</p><br/><p>Although Duanmu Qing felt that only the son she gave birth to, was the legitimate son and was qualified to inherit the throne, but these past ten years, her belly didn\u2019t even move a little. No matter how many medicine she ate, it didn\u2019t become better.</p><br/><p>The emperor was now really crazy for the soft like water Murong Xue Lian. The first and fifteen of every month, he would just come to Qing Luan Palace as a routine. The other times, he was at Piao Xue palace accompanying Murong Xue Lian and youngest daughter Longze Jin Er.</p><br/><p>Now Murong Xue Lian was four months pregnant. If she gives birth to a son, seeing how the emperor currently favors her, by that time she is afraid that her status as the empress will not be safe, let alone having the chance to give birth to the crown prince.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Yi, didn\u2019t you say that Murong Qi Qi has Lian gongzi\u2019s 2 Xue Fu pill? If bengong 3 orders a yizhi for her to bring Lian gongzi to cure your hand, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yizhi is an imperial decree by the empress or empress dowager</p><br/><p>Shengzhi is an imperial decree by the emperor</p><br/><p>Even though she knew that Duanmu Yi Yi fancied Longzi Jing Tian, but Duanmu Qing would never let Yi Yi marry Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>At that time, when He Xin Er gave birth to a prince before her, it really made her heart troubled. Although He Xin Er was now dead, but Longze Jin Tian had won the empress dowager\u2019s love and because of this, also got the emperor\u2019s favor. These things were really difficult for Duanmu Qing to accept.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that the emperor was in the prime of his life and she was also just 32 years old. She still had the chance to get pregnant. As long as the emperor hadn\u2019t established the crown prince, she would give it a shot! Even if the emperor was determined but this throne should be her child\u2019s! It\u2019s she who is the empress!</p><br/><p>Duanmu family, being her mother\u2019s family, should support her, this empress, with all their strength. Whether it was Duanmu Hong Chen or Duanmu Yi Yi, their marriage should have some value.</p><br/><p>One side being prosperous, both sides would be prosperous. One side lost, both sides would lose. Without a strong backing, setting a foothold in the palace was very difficult. For the great families, even if they had the ability and were really skillful, without anybody in the palace, it would be useless.</p><br/><p>In her heart, Duanmu Qing had already selected a husband for Duanmu Yi Yi. Letting her marry great family Shangguan family\u2019s Shangguan Wu Ji was the best choice. With Shangguan family\u2019s prestige in the military, if she gives birth to a prince, then this entire empire would then be her son\u2019s!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi didn\u2019t know that her fate had long been arranged by Duanmu Qing. At this time, she only wanted to talk about Lian gongzi with Duanmu Qing.</p><br/><p>Strange doctor Lian gongzi\u2019s medical skills were rumored to have reached the level of gods. If Murong Qi Qi really could bring Lian gongzi, not only would her hand have hope to recover, even the empress\u2019 inability to get pregnant will have hope to be cured.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, if Murong Qi Qi can\u2019t invite Lian gongzi, then what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t invite?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing\u2019s lips revealed a cruel smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen bengong will strip her title of Jing wangfei4, making her become an abandoned wife even before being married!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi was really happy. Aunt hadn\u2019t forgotten her. She really would take revenge on her behalf. But just thinking about her right hand, Duanmu Yi Yi felt really contradictory. Lian gongzi was her only hope for getting her right hand cured. She didn\u2019t want to have a crippled right hand for life.</p><br/><p>Seeming to have guessed what Duanmu Yi Yi was thinking, Duanmu Qing gently patted her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt knows your mind. Don\u2019t worry, aunt would surely not let Murong Qi Qi become Jing wangfei! Two sisters, one becoming Imperial noble conosrt and one becoming Jing wangfei, won\u2019t they get too prosperous by then?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, you\u2019re the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi laughed darkly. Murong Qi Qi, before long, you\u2019ll become an abandoned wife. I want to see how long you could still be so proud!</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the empress\u2019s yizhi to reach Murong fu5. The yizhi said very clearly, being sentenced to death could be escaped, but living in hardship would be difficult to escape. Murong Qi Qi must find Lian gongzi within ten days to cure Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s hand to make up for her mistake!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, the empress is obviously wearing the same pair of pants as Duanmu Yi Yi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei cut a peach and brought it to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips with a bamboo stick.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do? Really going to cure her hand? By this subordinate\u2019s meaning, she dared to point a sword at miss, that hand being crippled is not even enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi ate small chunks of peach. Really sweet. She always liked sweet fruits.</p><br/><p>No one knew that the renowned Lian gongzi was actually Murong fu\u2019s third miss. Duanmu Yi Yi and Duanmu Qing would have never thought that the person they were looking for was now comfortably eating a peach.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, saving one life is better than to build a seven floor pagoda. Of course I need to cure Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s hand. Not only will I cure her, I also will cure Duanmu Qing\u2019s inability to get pregnant, letting her be able to get pregnant with a prince. The empress has longed for this child for a long time. After she gives birth to a legitimate son, Xi Qi country will become lively!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s smile was very sweet. Her voice was soft, but Su Mei was aware of the plot behind Murong Qi Qi\u2019s smile. This miss had a personality of wishing for the world to be in chaos. Presumably she had thought of some fun things\u2014-Su Mei silently began to pray for the people who were being calculated by Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>The empress\u2019 yizhi didn\u2019t scare Murong Qi Qi. Instead, it made the imperial noble consort Murong Xue Lian at Piao Xue Palace become worried. Murong Xue Lian knew that Duamu Qing wanting to cure Duanmu Yi Yi was just an excuse. In fact, it was for herself. This woman was nearly going crazy from wanting a son! It was just how did Murong Qi Qi that rubbish got to know Lian gongzi? If Lian gongzi really cured the empress and Duanmu Qing becomes pregnant with a dragon, then what should she (MXL) do?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! The place of the crown prince is bengong child\u2019s. Benggong will certainly not let go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian stroked her slight bulged belly, called her confidante Hu Po and said some things to her. She let her go to the prime minister\u2019s mansion to convey her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, this is the reward that imperial noble consort gifted you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Po put a box with pearl jewelry in front of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally beautiful, ah! Are they really for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi face is full of disbelief. She touched the bean sized pearls carefully. Her eyes had been attracted by them like it was the first time she saw such good things.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018lack of knowledge\u2019 expression, Hu Po twitched her lips and looked at her sarcastically: \u201cIt\u2019s good that third miss likes it! How did third miss got to know Lian gongzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, when I went to the mountain to get herbs, I got to know him! Lian is very nice to people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the other party finally got to the real subject, Murong Qi Qi smiled like a silly person and revealed her white teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi call Lian gongzi so affectionately, Hu Po was surprised. But her expression was still the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where is Lian gongzi now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi shook her head. Her eyes were confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been three years since I last saw him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Po felt a little relieved. It seemed that Lian gongzi and Murong Qi Qi haven\u2019t been in contact with each other for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu Po big sister, why are you asking this? Look, does this pearl flower look good on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stood in front of the bronze mirror, put a pearl hairpin in her hair while making poses.</p><br/><p>Once again rolling her eyes, Hu Po didn\u2019t have any more patience to bother with Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>1.

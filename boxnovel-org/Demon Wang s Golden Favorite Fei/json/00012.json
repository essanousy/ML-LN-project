Let it be the award of the winner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Qing, could it be that you\u2019re joking?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei at a side picks up the medal and looked at it for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould this be the Long Hu Ling from the legend? I heard that with this medal, you can command every people of Li family to do anything\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s Long Hu Ling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know what Long Hu Ling was, but the other three families including Murong family knew the importance this Long Hu Ling had in the Li family.</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing casually bet the Long Hu Ling on Murong Qi Qi. Waht was he plotting?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle cousin sister, I put the lives of my family on you. If you lose, when I return, I\u2019ll need to kneel at the ancestral shrine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing\u2019s calm words and his green jade colored clothes made him seem more upright.</p><br/><p>He slowly walked to Murong Qi Qi, lowered his head and looked at her. How come in so many years, he hadn\u2019t noticed that this little cousin sister had a pair of astonishing eyes?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how dazzling this pair of eyes would be under the moonlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see the appearance of big cousin brother kneeling at the ancestral shrine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi already understood this big cousin brother\u2019s character. He was someone who liked to watch and wasn\u2019t afraid that his back would get hurt. At this moment, he pushed her into the limelight while he was sitting at a side, watching a play! This guy absolutely did it intentionally!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha ha\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words, Li Yun Qing laughed out loud. Because of his laughter, the hairs on his shoulder flew.</p><br/><p>\u201cHearing little cousin sister say this, I know that I won the bet!\u201d</p><br/><p>A handsome man was a handsome man. Every gesture, every smile or angriness; all were like a painting.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t see the coldness in Li Yun Qing\u2019s smiling eyes, instead she saw a touch of gentleness. Could it be that she saw wrong?</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to understand the reason. Li Yun Qing went back and continued to sit leisurely as if he was certain that Murong Qi Qi will win over Duanmu Yi Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always believed in Yun Qing\u2019s eyes\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei pulled down the jade ring on his thumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, if you lose, when I return, I\u2019ll have the same fate as brother Li, ah! Hoping that third miss will work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Mu Fei\u2019s ring also let people be startled. Everyone knew that among the four great families, Bai family was the richest in the capital. Now every business was taken care of by this eldest young master. This jade ring was also his keepsake.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince big brother thinks that third miss will win, I\u2019ll also bet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue pulled out a golden buyao1.</p><br/><p>tumblr_noefsea94a1u796z6o1_500</p><br/><p>buyao</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Guang Hua gongzi\u2019s 2newest hairpin design Bu Bu Shang Lian. Third miss, add oil!\u201d</p><br/><p>Add oil is a Chinese saying for do your best</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi never thought that Li family and Bai family would bet on Murong Qi Qi. This was really bullying people too much! Which one of the three things they bet wasn\u2019t a treasure? Bai Yi Yue\u2019s \u2018Bu Bu Sheng Lian\u2019 was Tong Bao Zhai\u2019s Guang Hua gongzi\u2019s work. You couldn\u2019t even buy it money.</p><br/><p>Guang Hua gongzi just put out a few jewelries throughout the year. Every single one was one of a kind. The moment it came out, it was sold. Even the consorts in the palace took pride at having Guang Hua gongzi\u2019s jewelries.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi had wished for this \u2018Bu Bu Sheng Lian\u2019 for a long time. For a girl, having jewelry from Guang Hua gongzi would be the happiest thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! You all have full confidence in her. When the time comes, don\u2019t regret!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi gritted her teeth. She couldn\u2019t believe it. Where was Murong Qi Qi better than her and could get Li family and Bai family\u2019s affection?!</p><br/><p>Right! Bai Mu Fei and Li Yun Qing have a good relationship. It must definitely be because of Li Yun Qing\u2019s face that they stood at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side. It must be like that!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s words once again let Shangguan Wu Ji frown. He silently put a black dagger on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet that third miss will win!\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to the three others, Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s dagger didn\u2019t seem significant, but Murong Qi Qi thought that the thing Shangguan Wu Ji carried on his body must be a treasure.</p><br/><p>She picked up the dagger and pulled it out,</p><br/><p>\u2018Ceng\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>A light shone, making everyone unable to open their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood dagger,\u201d Murong Qi Qi said softly.</p><br/><p>Although this dagger looked normal, the body was black. Lying on the floor, it would only be seen as an unusual dagger. But Murong Qi Qi who was familiar with a variety of weapons, knew that this was the \u2018cutting iron like flesh\u2019 treasure.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi liked it, Shangguan Wu Ji felt like he had found one of his kind.</p><br/><p>She was obviously a physically weak girl, but the focused look she had when holding the dagger, gave birth to a strange feeling in Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that third miss likes it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Shangguan, if I win, would this dagger really be mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had always liked daggers. It was easy to carry and this dagger was a rare treasure. She held it in her hand and didn\u2019t want to put it down.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! For this word, today this miss will risk my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi loved the dagger so much that she didn\u2019t want to put it down. Although in the eyes of others, Li family and Bai family\u2019s bets have the most luring power, but in her eyes, this dagger was her favorite.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird big sister, even boasting should have some ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian had also set her eyes on this dagger. Thinking that this dagger would simply be ruined in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands, Murong Qing Lian directly bet on Duanmu Yi Yi. If Duanmu Yi Yi wins, she could ask for the dagger!</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet on miss Duanmu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian also bet on Duanmu Yi Yi. No need to say of Murong Jun. He had always looked down on Murong Qi Qi plus the fact that Duanmu Yi Yi was a beautiful lady, so, naturally he needed to please the beauty.</p><br/><p>The remaining Duanmu Hong Chen, after looked once more at his little sister and Murong Qi Qi, smiled apologetically at Murong Qi Qi. He put a jade in front of Duanmu Yi Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, third miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brothers and sisters should help each other. Besides, Murong Qi Qi felt that she didn\u2019t have a deep friendship with Duanmu Hong Chen that was worthy for him to abandon his little sister and bet on her.</p><br/><p>After it was settled, each side had the same number of people, but the bets on Murong Qi Qi side were obviously more expensive, making Duanmu Yi Yi\u2019s heart imbalanced.</p><br/><p>The four great families\u2019 relationship wasn\u2019t bad, but the other three families seemed like today they had drunk the wrong medicine by betting their treasures on Murong Qi Qi. How could Duanmu Yi Yi not be angry?</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, what do you want? This is our bet; you also need to bet something! But looking at your poor appearance, you won\u2019t be able to pull out any treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gritting her teeth, Duanmu Yi Yi removed the egg-sized East Sea pearls on her skirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you win, these pearls will be yours. If you lose\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Yi Yi swept over the calm lake and smiled viciously. Slender fingers pointed at the sparkling lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you to jump into the lake!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Buyao: haiprin that shakes with every steps you take from her hair</p><br/><p>2. Gongzi: unmarried men/ also used to call famous unmarried man/ young master</p><br/>\n</div>"}

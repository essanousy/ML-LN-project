No matter how we say it, this matter is Yu Er\u2019s fault. Zhen2 will apologize to wangfei3 for Yu Er.\u201d</p><br/><p>In just a few minutes, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s status has upgraded from princess to wangfei. These words seemed to go along with Feng Cang\u2019s mind. Feng Cang stopped. It\u2019s just that he still guarded Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangfei, zhen doesn\u2019t have many children. Although Yu Er was being too much, but after all she is zhen\u2019s biological daughter. Zhen was lax in discipline. Zhen is also wrong. It\u2019s just can you understand a father\u2019s heart. Can you not not let zhen be the white haired person to send a black haired person away?\u201d</p><br/><p>White hared person to send a black haired person away: to see one\u2019s child die before oneself</p><br/><p>Longze Yu\u2019s words were very emotional. It didn\u2019t rule out any possibility to get sympathy. To this point, he is still protecting Longze Yu Er. This point compared to Murong Tai who was silent from the beginning and let Murong Qi Qi fend for herself is much stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat emperor said makes sense\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi seemed to be somewhat moved, but Feng Cang remained silent. He has already handed this matter for his little wangfei to deal with. It\u2019s just a cheap life. If Murong Qi Qi wants to let Longze Yu Er off, then he won\u2019t stop. If Murong Qi Qi wants Longze Yu Er\u2019s life, then he will certainly help her get it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi so soon swayed and no longer pursued the matter, Longze Yu exhaled. It seemed that she is just a little liar girl. Just with some eloquent words and she relented.</p><br/><p>Seeing Longze Yu\u2019s thoughts, Murong Qi Qi slowly wiped her tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard there\u2019s an idiom \u2018a financial loss may prevent disaster\u2019. If emperor is willing to give up a little something in exchange for princess\u2019s life, then bengong4 can reconsider this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that Murong Qi Qi proposed an exchange, Longze Yu nodded: \u201cGood! No problem! If wangfei let bygones be bygones, whatever you want, zhen will give you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Longze Yu\u2019s golden words fell, Murong Qi Qi laughed. Seeing that girl\u2019s smile in front of him, Longze Yu suddenly has a feeling of falling into a trap. Can it be that Murong Qi Qi went around such a circle and was waiting here for him?</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Longze Yu to understand, Murong Qi Qi said: \u201cI heard my father say, inside Xi Qi\u2019s palace there is a century old Tai Sui. It\u2019s just happens that our wangye still miss a Tai Sui for his medicine. Why don\u2019t we use this as exchange\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>I have no idea what a ?? (Tai Sui) is. It\u2019s probably a kind of (herbal) plant which is good for the body</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi hasn\u2019t finished speaking yet, Longze Yu already felt so much pain, he almost bled.</p><br/><p>This century old Tai Sui is something his emperor father looted from Da Qin palace when he established Xi Qi. It\u2019s priceless. It\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s able to make you feel healthy and let you live longer. It\u2019s a treasure he left to save his life, ah!</p><br/><p>Da Qin is the dynasty before the world was split into four. </p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi say that it\u2019s Murong Tai who told her, Longze Yu glared once fiercely at Murong Tai. This bastard! He actually told Murong Qi Qi this! Now Murong Qi Qi is taking this as exchange, what should he do?</p><br/><p>Murong Tai had no choice but to suffer in silence. He had unspeakable bitter suffering. He doesn\u2019t remember when he has told Murong Qi Qi this. Could it be when he was drunk? This girl is usually very stupid. Why at this moment is she so clever?</p><br/><p>Longze Yu was silent, making Murong Qi Qi smile. She gentle \u2018cheche\u2019 two times and looked with somewhat sympathy at Longze Yu Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that emperor doesn\u2019t really love you. Then bengong can only tackle this difficult job and take your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er knelt in front of Longze Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father, usually doesn\u2019t you love Yu Er the most? Can it be that you want to see Yu Er die in front of you? Emperor father, how can you watch and do nothing? Then, what will the world say about you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s last words, hit Longze Yu\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Usually he paid most attention to things like virtues and moralities. If today he let Murong Qi Qi behead Longze Yu Er, then the one whose reputation will be damaged is him, this country\u2019s ruler. If the citizens know that he is so ruthless and without a heart, watching and doing nothing, then the people\u2019s heart will be unstable. By that time, he will lose even more!</p><br/><p>Gritting his teeth, Longze Yu nodded and accepted Murong Qi Qi\u2019s requirements.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s for making medicine for wangye, then this is a must! Let\u2019s take it as a dowry zhen gave princess Zhao Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the servants brought the century old Tai Sui, Murong Qi Qi accepted it. She smiled and bowed at Longze Yu.</p><br/><p>Seeing his treasure in the arms of Murong Qi Qi, Longze Yu really wanted to rush forward and grab it back.</p><br/><p>The immortality that many ancient emperors seek is this Tai Sui. Not to mention that the one in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands is a century old Tai Sui, ah! Cut of one, one will grow. Eating one today, tomorrow one will grow. Such a treasure went to Murong Qi Qi with just one sentence. Now Longze Yu\u2019s heart is really bleeding and his body is in pain.</p><br/><p>After her life was saved, Longze Yu Er let a breath out of relief. She finally survived! She survived without any damage! Although emperor father lost a century old Tai Sui, but she is a princess. Can it be that a princess\u2019s life is less worthy than that Tai Sui?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s heart didn\u2019t felt comfortable yet, when Murong Qi Qi slowly walked in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s smile, Longze Yu Er took two steps back. Her eyes were alert.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Tai Sui was given to you. We don\u2019t own each other anything. Murong Qi Qi don\u2019t go overboard, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, do you want to know who deceive you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice was very low. Only the two of them could hear. \u201cDeceive me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er froze for a moment and didn\u2019t understand the meaning of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa, pa\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi clapped. Someone who looked like a maid came forward and knelt in front of Longze Yu Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er was sure she has never seen this maid before. What does this maid have to do with what Murong Qi Qi said?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis slave is Fei Cui.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who shouted wasn\u2019t Longze Yu Er but Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>What happened? Was Fei Cui not beaten to death by her? Why is she here? Why does she have anything to do with Murong Qi Qi? Murong Xin Lian\u2019s right eye suddenly twitched badly. Left eye twitching means wealth, right eye twitching means disaster. Can it be that some bad things will happen again?</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, are you surprised that this slave didn\u2019t die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui slowly stood up. She glared fiercely at Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou let me steal the glowing pear and put it in third miss\u2019s room to frame her. I did it! You let me release rumors to sully third miss. I did it! You let me pour drug into third miss drink to ruin her reputation. I did it! You wanted to take the opportunity to kill third miss and let me watch out, I also did it\u2026\u2026I was so loyal to you, why do you want to murder me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui\u2019s words made everyone whisper. So everything was done by this Jing wang\u2019s cefei5, ah! So she was behind all of that!</p><br/><p>\u201cReally you did all of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian gritted his teeth while looking at the woman next to him. All those rumors were made by her. All of the things to make him misunderstand has been done her. This woman is so vicious! And he is so foolish to believe those rumors. That\u2019s why she and that girl missed out each other!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

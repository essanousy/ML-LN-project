This person really was a master at acting. If Murong Qing Lian continued on like this, sooner or later, she would suffer defeat at Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was watching a play as she clutched her chest. Suddenly, she felt a gaze on her. She raised her head and saw Li Yun Qing.</p><br/><p>This man was really beautiful!</p><br/><p>Really black hair was hanging lazily behind the ears. A simple bamboo hairpin was in his hair. Dressed in emerald colored clothes that showed this man\u2019s tall stature even more. Looking at those eyes, they were as gentle as the spring breeze in May. Just with one glance, it could warm a person\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that gentleness was also a knife. From the gentle eyes of that man, Murong Qi Qi saw the cold at the bottom of those eyes. Such a man may seem gentle and passionate, but was actually the most ruthless. Must definitely not provoke him.</p><br/><p>With just one glance, Murong Qi Qi set Li Yun Qing on the side of never contacting again. Towards such a man who was soft on the surface but cold in the heart, Murong Qi Qi would unconsciously exclude him.</p><br/><p>Feeling that Li Yun Qing was looking at her with probing eyes, Murong Qi Qi lowered her eyes, clutched her chest and coughed softly as if that kick really did her some harm.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cough broke the play that was just playing. Only now did Murong Tai saw the pale-faced Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Towards this daughter Murong Qi Qi, Murong Tai didn\u2019t have any deep feelings. To Murong Tai, in this life he didn\u2019t have any special regret. When he was young, his career rose meteorically. Later, he married one of the four great families, Li family\u2019s eldest daughter. His worth became double of what it was. Now, he is above ten thousand of people and under one person. His eldest daughter is an Imperial Nobel Consort. So, he was very satisfied.</p><br/><p>If Murong Tai had sand in his eyes, the only sand in his eyes was his third daughter Murong Qi Qi. Xi Qi Country favoured martial arts. Be it men or women, young or old, the nobility or the civilians, every one practiced martial arts. Respect came with martial arts. The first emperor, Emperor Gaozu got the world with martial arts. Martial arts was the national soul of Xi Qi. In Xi Qi Country, no matter if you are rich or poor, if you knew martial arts, you would be respected and you would succeed more easily.</p><br/><p>Although Murong Tai was a literary person, he also knew some fists kung fu. The concubines he married also had some skills; every child born had some good talent in learning martial arts.</p><br/><p>Originally, life could continue to be perfect like this, but this abnormal Murong Qi Qi appeared. More directly said, Murong Qi Qi was a rubbish. Since the test she received when she was one year old from a monk who\u2019d concluded that she couldn\u2019t practice martial arts, Murong Tai lost all hope in this daughter. Although she is a woman, she still couldn\u2019t practice martial arts. She was nothing but something to warm the bed. She was just useless rubbish.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, ever since then, Murong Tai discarded Murong Qi Qi in a remote house and was indifferent towards her. Even knowing that she wouldn\u2019t steal and certainly knowing that there was an ulterior motive, even if she\u2019s a legitimate daughter, but what does it matter?</p><br/><p>In Murong Tai\u2019s eyes, even raising a dog would have the role of watching the house. And for the one who didn\u2019t have any value to the prime minister, Murong Qi Qi was even inferior to a dog\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Now, Murong Qi Qi who had been sent to Jing Xin An for five years by Murong Tai, had been back for three days. From the moment she came back till now, Murong Tai had not seen this third daughter. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Murong Tai couldn\u2019t help but carefully observe Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Pale skin, slender eyebrows, the eyes were not big, the bridge of the nose was not high, the lips were not thin nor thick and the color of the lips was somewhat light. She could only be considered a delicate and normal woman.</p><br/><p>Murong Tai was a handsome man himself and his wife Li Qiu Shui was one of the beauties. His first daughter, the now Imperial Noble Consort Murong Xue Lian, before she had entered the palace, she\u2019d already been given the name of \u2018number one beauty of the capital\u2019. Now his second daughter Murong Xin Lian is being called the number one beauty of the capital. His youngest daughter Murong Qing Lian, although she\u2019s young, she was already quite pretty. Even his only son is also handsome. Only Murong Qi Qi seemed to not have inherited their strong points. In this family full of beauties, she could only be considered an ordinary and mediocre grass.</p><br/><p>Originally, Murong Tai thought that Murong Qi Qi would change after these five years. After seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s looks, the displeasure in his heart welled up again.</p><br/><p>To him, this rubbish daughter is like a mole of a beauty on the tip of her nose, spoiling the landscape. She is also like a fish bone in the throat; couldn\u2019t go down but also couldn\u2019t be spit out, really annoying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai didn\u2019t have any place to vent his anger. Just at the right moment, he saw Murong Qi Qi to vent his anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just came back, the rumors are aleeady flying outside. Really a good thing that you did!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai didn\u2019t ask for the right or wrong of the matter and just scolded, making Murong Qi Qi feel a lot of \u2018grievances\u2019. With Su Yue\u2019s help, Murong Qi Qi cautiously stood at one side. Her head was lowered till her chest and she didn\u2019t say a word. She looked like an innocent little lamb.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, this is the place where little cousin lives. Of course, she should be here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Murong Qi Qi wanted to continue to pretend to be mute, from one side she heard a voice speaking up for her. Listening to it, it was actually Li Yun Qing.</p><br/><p>This person would actually speak up for her? This made Murong Qi Qi very surprised. Although she needed to call Li Yun Qing big cousin brother, but their relationship was just normal. They didn\u2019t get together a lot.</p><br/><p>Seeing Li Yun Qing open his mouth, Murong Tai could only smile: \u201cOh, yes, here is third little girl\u2019s Cui Zhu yuan.\u201d1</p><br/><p>Although Li Yun Qing is Li Qiu Shui\u2019s big brother\u2019s son and is a younger generation, Li Yun Qing is the eldest son of Li Kiu, current patriarch of the Li family. In the younger generation, he was considered a talent and also Li family\u2019s future patriarch. Since he had opened his mouth, Murong Tai had to give him face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t come here for a long time. I actually didn\u2019t know that little cousin sister lived in such a place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing looked once around Cui Zhu yuan. This shabby old place, just with one look, you would know that Murong Qi was not treated well at the prime minister\u2019s.</p><br/><p>If it was usually, Li Yun Qing wouldn\u2019t have opened his mouth to help, but just now he was surprised to see a hint of \u2018watching a play\u2019 from Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes. This little cousin sister seemed to have changed. So he naturally wouldn\u2019t mind to help.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs far as I know, little sister cousin just came back! Just coming back and outside, there\u2019s already so many rumors. I think someone is jealous that little cousin sister is about to become Jing wangfei2, that\u2019s why they made up those rumors. Uncle, these rumors should have been let out by people of the mansion. I think you should investigate well to see who dared to bully my, Li Yun Qing\u2019s little cousin sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing\u2019s words had three layers of meanings:</p><br/><p>First: Murong Qi Qi had just come back. She didn\u2019t even have a chance to go out. Those rumors were naturally prepared by other people.</p><br/><p>Second: the people who had spread these rumors must be jealous that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was Jing wang3. This was obviously a slander.</p><br/><p>Third: no matter how bad Murong Qi Qi was, her mother is the first wife, Li family\u2019s eldest daughter. Behind her, there\u2019s still Li family.</p><br/><p>Murong Tai naturally understood the meaning of Li Yun Qing\u2019s words. He didn\u2019t think that Murong Qi Qi would enter Li Yun Qing\u2019s eyes and to also let him protect her like this.</p><br/><p>1. Yuan: a wing/ part of a residence</p><br/><p>2. Wangfei: main wife/ conosrt of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He felt that he was already sitting tightly on the throne. He also began to speak and do things with the bureaucratic accent. He wanted to train himself, so that he could have the posture of a crown prince earlier on.</p><br/><p>The debate about the new crown prince intensified. However, the two popular people, Feng Cang and Wanyan Yi, reacted differently.</p><br/><p>The former directly handed a petition for a sick leave to Wanyan Lie. It said that his body felt unwell and he needed to rest. He left the capital with princess Zhen Guo almost a month ago. It seemed that nothing was important to him. As for the latter, he had been constantly wandering among officials and actively strove for their support.</p><br/><p>The difference between the former and latter was obvious at a glance. There were people who said that if Feng Cang still doesn\u2019t return, then the throne would be taken away. There were also others who said that Feng Cang couldn\u2019t beat Wanyan Yi. After all, the other party was a true imperial bloodline. In short, the public opinion inclined towards Wanyan Yi as if he had already become Bei Zhou\u2019s future emperor.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan, who\u2019s inside Jinxuan palace, after getting to know the situation outside the palace, she repeatedly praised Feng Cang\u2019s act of leaving the capital. Now, it\u2019s where the wind and waves are the fiercest. Standing on a wave, when it falls, the body would be torn and the bones crushed.</p><br/><p>Where the wind and waves are the fiercest: at the heart of the struggle</p><br/><p>Although Dongfang Lan really wanted Feng Cang to return and discuss about Feng Xie with her grandson, but now everyone\u2019s eyes were focused on the position of the crown prince. Even if Feng Cang didn\u2019t have those thoughts, but three men talking makes a tiger and would let him get caught into a whirlpool. He and Murong Qi Qi leaving this trouble behind them was the best choice.</p><br/><p>Three men talking makes a tiger: repeated rumor becomes a fact</p><br/><p>It was just, Feng Cang didn\u2019t return, and Feng Xie also no longer appeared. The suspense in Dongfang Lan\u2019s heart had never been solved. There was always a knot in her heart, making her sleepless. If what Feng Xie said was the truth, she couldn\u2019t not take revenge for her daughter!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, the person is here.\u201d Inside the temple, Qing Gu brought Chun Xing over. After nursing for about a month, Chun Xing could finally get out of bed and walk. Although her complexion was still a bit pale, but now she was full of spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking empress dowager for the grace of saving this slave\u2019s life!\u201d The moment Chun Xing arrived, she knelt in front of Dongfang Lan and kowtowed. She knew her life had been saved by the empress dowager. If it wasn\u2019t because of Dongfang Lan, she would\u2019ve long become a ghost.</p><br/><p>After seeing Chun Xing\u2019s appearance, Dongfang Lan nodded slightly. Although her complexion was still not very good, but being alive was better than anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, stand up! Don\u2019t kneel. Your body hasn\u2019t recovered completely yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan looked kind and her voice was filled with affection, making the originally nervous Chun Xing gradually calm down. She bowed once again to Dongfang Lan. Then, Chun Xing stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, you said before that noble consort Yue was innocent. Then, tell aijia1 in full detail about everything that had happened in Long Autumn palace. If she truly was wronged, aijia would definitely help her wash away her grievances.\u201d</p><br/><p>The empress dowager\u2019s promise set Chun Xing\u2019s mind at ease. When she was about to talk, Chun Xing saw the painting on the wall. When she saw the appearance of the person in painting, Chun Xing couldn\u2019t help but scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Qing Gu couldn\u2019t help but look at Chun Xing. She saw Chun Xing look with an open mouth and in shock at the beauty in the painting. She asked Qing Gu, \u201cAunt, who is the person in painting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s aijia\u2019s daughter, Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Ming Yue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s explanation left Chun Xing dumbfounded, \u201cBut, but, princess and noble consort Yue look so much alike. They have a seventy to eighty percent of similarity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Really?\u201d Dongfang Lan didn\u2019t expect that in this world, there was someone who looked like Wanyan Ming Yue. The moment Qing Gu heard this, she saw the problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, do you remember, on the night noble consort Yue tried to assassinate the emperor, this slave saw a girl who looked like princess in Long Autumn palace. This slave was just about to ask her origin, when she was killed by eunuch Jing De. This slave remembers that at that moment, that girl said someone had brought her to be an imperial noble consort!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that person imperial noble consort Yue?\u201d Dongfang Lan looked at Chun Xing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I saw that woman\u2019s corpse. Although she looked like imperial noble consort, but she isn\u2019t imperial noble consort. This slave also doesn\u2019t know why she had appeared at Long Autumn palace! This slave had never seen this person before!\u201d</p><br/><p>One after another mysteries plagued Dongfang Lan. If it was said that Yue Lan Zhi looked like Wanyan Ming Yue; then later, a young girl who looked like Wanyan Ming Yue entered the palace to be imperial noble consort, could it be that the young girl had come to substitute? Was it that Yue Lan Zhi had long died?</p><br/><p>It was just, why would the emperor search for a girl who looked like Wanyan Ming Yue to be the imperial noble consort? Could it be\u2026Thinking till here, Dongfang Lan\u2019s complexion changed dramatically. She also thought about the rumors in the capital; crown prince Wanyan Hong and princess Wanyan Bao Zhu had committed incest. Dongfang Lan\u2019s head suddenly exploded. She didn\u2019t dare to think any further.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, miss, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Gu saw that Dongfang Lan\u2019s complexion wasn\u2019t good. She immediately went forward to pat her back. Only after a long while did she calm down. In the end, Dongfang Lan wasn\u2019t an ordinary woman. Although she was shocked at her own thoughts, but she didn\u2019t have any proof, so she wouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, tell aijia about the matter of Long Autumn palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s topic returned to Chun Xing. Chun Xing nodded. She told everything she knew about what had happened at Long Autumn palace from beginning to end to Dongfang Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll around, nine imperial noble consorts were changed? Aijia remembers that Cang er2 has also married nine times\u2026You said that every time the emperor doted on noble consort Yue, it was for a very long time? And that every time he would let Jing De guard at the door and doesn\u2019t let anyone else go in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, empress dowager! However, on the day of the accident, eunuch Jing De wasn\u2019t at the door. Later, he suddenly came out in a panic and called two people inside. Afterwards, the news of the emperor being attacked was spread out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that night, this slave saw very clearly. Imperial noble consort didn\u2019t leave the place. The whole night, this slave kept watch not far from the hall. No one came out from the inside. Besides, the two people eunuch Jing De had called in were also killed. They had certainly seen something they shouldn\u2019t have. That\u2019s why they were silenced! After the emperor woke up, everyone from Long Autumn palace had been killed, except for this slave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Xing\u2019s wails let Dongfang Lan\u2019s thoughts become more chaotic. What kind of secret was hidden in Long Autumn palace? What kind of shady thing did Wanyan Lie do? Could it be that he really had an unusual hobby? If what Feng Xie and Chun Xing said was the truth, then the matter of Yandang mountain was not difficult to understand. It was definitely Wanyan Lie who had played tricks from behind!</p><br/><p>\u201cChun Xing, aijia has a headache. You can retreat! Aijia would definitely investigate this matter as the water recedes, the rocks appear and give noble consort Yue an explanation!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the water recedes, the rocks appear: the truth will come to light</p><br/><p>After Chun Xing left, Qing Gu came to Dongfang Lan\u2019s side to massage her temples, \u201cMiss, if it truly was the emperor\u2026What do you plan to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA murder should be paid with one\u2019s life, a debt owed should be paid back!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Aijia: I, used by an empress dowager</p><br/><p>2. Er: tern of endearment</p><br/><p>While saying this sentence, undoubtedly, the hatred inside Dongfang Lan\u2019s eyes manifested. For so many years. she didn\u2019t know that the person she faced was the enemy who killed her daughter!</p><br/><p>Sixteen years! So many days and nights, for Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s death, she cried till the tears dried from her eyes. However, she didn\u2019t expect that the enemy who killed her daughter, who she searched so hard for was in front of her! If this matter was really done by Wanyan Lie, she must take revenge for Wanyan Ming Yue!</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue, mother did you wrong! Mother got old and my eyes got blind. Mother couldn\u2019t distinguish who was the wolf and who was the human. But, don\u2019t worry, mother\u2019s heart is not muddled. After determining the truth of the matter, mother would definitely take revenge for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan rambled a lot in front of Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s painting. After a long time did Dongfang Lan recuperated from her desolate mood. She collected herself up. From a mother who missed her daughter, she changed again into a dignified empress dowager. Now, what Dongfang Lan needed to do was to find out the truth while remaining calm and collected.</p><br/><p>When Dongfang Lan and Qing Gu left, a black figure jumped from the roof. If Dongfang Lan returned now, she would be surprised at seeing this person. He was Feng Xie, the one everyone thought committed suicide and died for his country.</p><br/><p>The words Chun Xing said just now, Feng Xie heard them clearly. It turned out that Long Autumn palace had so many dirty things!</p><br/><p>Now Feng Xie was surer that there must be something similar to a dungeon in the chamber he went last time. Perhaps, perhaps in the underground, there would be a shameful secret. No, he must find a chance to go in!</p><br/><p>Feng Xie thought like that. He also immediately did so.</p><br/><p>The same night, taking advantage of the night, Feng Xie once again slipped into Long Autumn palace and once again returned to that chamber. Although this was only the second time Feng Xie came here, but because the furniture inside was the same as Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s boudoir, so Feng Xie was very familiar with this place. He didn\u2019t light up a light. Only taking advantage of the moonlight, Feng Xie began to explore the chamber.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s really was an underground palace, then a button to open the entrance must be in the chamber. Feng Xie carefully touched. When he touched a strange object and turned it, the ground suddenly collapsed. A passage appeared in front of Feng Xie.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure enough, there\u2019s an underground palace!\u201d Feng Xie was happily surprised. He stepped on the stairway and went down.</p><br/><p>This passage was very long. Feng Xie walked very carefully. After experiencing to many changes, he couldn\u2019t help but deal with everything carefully. When he reached the end, Feng Xie finally saw the Wanyan Ming Yue on the warm jade bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, Feng Xie called out loud. He rushed in two, three steps to the warm jade bed. His lips and hands began to tremble. Too unbelievable! Wanyan Ming Yue was still alive! The person he yearned for day and night, his wife, was still actually alive! To Feng Xie, this news was too shocking!</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue, I am Feng Xie, ah! Ming Yue, open your eyes and look at me! Ming Yue, wake up! What happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only a moment later, Feng Xie discovered where the problem lay. Although, Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s body was warm, but she was like a living dead with her eyes closed. If it wasn\u2019t because he called her for so long and Wanyan Ming Yue didn\u2019t wake up, he would\u2019ve thought that she was asleep.</p><br/><p>Feng Xie clutched Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hand and checked her pulse. He found out that her pulse was beating very slowly. It was almost undetectable. Looking once again at the warm jade bed Wanyan Ming Yue was sleeping on, Feng Xie finally understood the problem.</p><br/><p>It may be assumed that if it wasn\u2019t because of the protection of this warm jade bed, Wanyan Ming Yue would have died long ago. This was also why, Wanyan Ming Yue still looked like sixteen years ago. There wasn\u2019t a trace of aging.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue, I\u2019m Feng Xie!\u201d Feng Xie held Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019 hand. Tears rolled down his aged face. He had never thought that he could see Wanyan Ming Yue once again! Although, Feng Xie prayed to the gods to let Wanyan Ming Yue come back to him, but he knew that it was an extravagant hope.</p><br/><p>Now, although the extravagant hope became reality, but Wanyan Ming Yue continued to be asleep. This made Feng Xie\u2019s originally worried heart become heavier.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything was done by Wanyan Lie, right? Ming Yue, it\u2019s my fault. I was too careless! You once reminded me that accompanying one\u2019s sovereign is like accompanying a tiger, but I didn\u2019t believe you. I didn\u2019t think that my carelessness, in the end brought you calamity and also harmed our daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, Qi Qi is found. Now, I also found you. Tell me, is this god\u2019s charity out of pity towards us? Does this mean that our family will be reunited soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Joy and sadness lingered at the same time in Feng Xie\u2019s heart. To be able to see Wanyan Ming Yue once again, he almost went crazy from happiness. After the happiness, Feng Xie thought about how to bring Wanyan Ming Yue out.</p><br/><p>Just now, he checked the warm jade bed. He discovered that Wanyan Ming Yue was able to live like this was thanks to the effectiveness of the warm jade bed. If he takes Wanyan Ming Yue away by force, without the \u2018protection\u2019 of the warm jade bed, Wanyan Ming Yue may die.</p><br/><p>After all, Feng Xie wasn\u2019t a doctor. He couldn\u2019t check what kind of disease Wanyan Ming Yue had. Even more, he didn\u2019t dare to take her away without careful consideration. After losing too many things, Feng Xie didn\u2019t dare to take the bet. He didn\u2019t dare, even more, to bet with Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>After kissing Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s forehead once again, Feng Xie reluctantly left the underground palace. He wasn\u2019t a twenty, thirty-year-old hothead youngster anymore. These years, he sharpened on the grindstone. He knew what could be done and what couldn\u2019t be done.</p><br/><p>The first thing Feng Xie needed to do was go find Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo had the name of evil doctor. His medical skills must be very high. If Jin Mo couldn\u2019t heal Wanyan Ming Yue, then he needed to go find strange doctor Lian gongzi1. No matter what, he needed to cure Wanyan Ming Yue! He couldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t tolerate Wanyan Ming Yue to continue stay in the underground palace. The sooner this matter was dealt with, the better!</p><br/><p>In Yan capital, because the crown prince was deposed, the candidates for the position of the new crown prince was abuzz. At this time, the diplomats of Nan Feng under the leadership of the new emperor of Nan Feng, Ming Yue Cheng, arrived grandiosely at Yan capital.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng personally came to exchange documents between the two nations to make friends, making the citizens who originally focused on the candidates for the position of the new crown prince, shift their gaze a bit to this Nan Feng\u2019s new emperor.</p><br/><p>It was said that once, this new emperor had been a hostage in Xi Qi for a decade. It was said that this new emperor\u2019s empress mother was sentenced to death because of witchcraft. The first thing he did after ascending the throne was investigating the truth of that year and cleared the name of his empress mother and Miao clan. It was also said, there were some people who didn\u2019t accept this new emperor ascending the throne. He let the capital be dyed in blood. He used bloody means to subdue those who harbored misconducting thoughts.</p><br/><p>In short, Nan Feng\u2019s new emperor Ming Yue Cheng was a legendary person in the point of view of Bei Zhou\u2019s citizens. At least, such a young and promising talent and also with such an iron fist; there were only a few, even in this mainland.</p><br/><p>After seeing Ming Yue Cheng for the first time, Wanyan Lie couldn\u2019t help but lament in his heart. If there was a son who could be like Ming Yue Cheng with such an extraordinary bearing, even if his eyes were closed (died) right now, he could be at ease.</p><br/><p>Nan Feng\u2019s new emperor personally came to Bei Zhou and was also willing to sign a friendly agreement with Bei Zhou, was a thing Wanyan Lie welcomed with both hands.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie also understood a bit about the tactics of this new emperor. After seeing Ming Yue Cheng in person, Wanyan Lie had admiration, regret and pressure.</p><br/><p>This man was not a person of no particular talent. Under his management, Nan Feng would certainly become glorious and flourishing. This man would definitely be a strong opponent of Bei Zhou. None of his own sons could be compared to Ming Yue Cheng.</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Lei suddenly felt sorrowful.</p><br/><p>If he was the same age as Ming Yue Cheng, he could go head on head with him. However, now he\u2019s old. Talented people would be born every dynasty. In the future, this world would be the young generation\u2019s! Nan Feng could have such an emperor, but his princess; there was no one who could take such a heavy task!</p><br/><p>Nan Feng\u2019s new emperor came to Yan capital. Naturally Bei Zhou\u2019s princess needed to keep him company. Besides, their ages were not far apart. It was a lot easier to have a chat. When Ming Yue Cheng opened his mouth, he asked for Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t zhen2 see Nan Lin wang 3 today? Is it that because being newly married, Feng Cang has a beauty to accompany him, he\u2019s unable to deal with anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s words clearly had a teasing tone. After hearing his words, Wanyan Yi laughed, \u201cProbably, Your Majesty doesn\u2019t know. Princess Zhen Guo who came for a marriage alliance, in fact is Nan Lin wang\u2019s biological little sister. This time, Feng Cang\u2019s old disease acted again. Princess Zhen Guo accompanied him to relieve boredom!\u201d</p><br/><p>The originally simple matter, coming from Wanyan Yi\u2019s mouth, changed into something that had a strange taste. Coupled with his strange expression, those who listened to him, revealed an ambiguous smile, except for Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang knew that this second big brother of him coveted the throne for a long time. However, that was his (WY) own problem. Why did he had to bring cousin brother into everything? He (WK) is very supportive of cousin brother and cousin in law. Although, he knew clearly that if he gets too close to Feng Cang, it would let Wanyan Yi and consort mother get angry. However, Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t like them, these people who engage in conspiracies and whom played tricks.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy cousin brother\u2019s body had always not been well. Before, he went to Xi Qi. Not even two days after he returned, he rushed to Yongzhou to preside over the tournament of the four countries. When he just came back, he was busy preparing for the marriage. He didn\u2019t rest. That was why, he became ill from being too tired. He asked for a sick leave from father and went to nurse his health.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang spoke up for Feng Cang, made Wanyan Yi couldn\u2019t help but glare at him once. Sometimes, Wanyan Yi suspected if this little brother was given birth by consort mother. Why did his elbows turn the wrong way every time?! He made it seem like Feng Cang was his biological brother!</p><br/><p>Elbows turn the wrong way: favor an outsider instead of someone on one\u2019s own side.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom my point of view, it\u2019s because princess Zhen Guo\u2019s identity was announced publicly; lovers became siblings. He couldn\u2019t accept it. That was why he fell ill. This time, saying that it was nursing his health, but bringing Feng Qi Qi; who knows what they are doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial big brother, how could you say this?!\u201d Hearing Wanyan Yi say this, Wanyan Kang got angry.</p><br/><p>Others didn\u2019t know, but he got inside news from Su Mei. Cousin brother and cousin in law went to a honeymoon this time. They finally could break through the obstacles and get together. This was a happy thing. The original beautiful thing, after being added with a vulgar tone by Wanyan Yi; no matter how you listen it, it was uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWanyan Kang, are you my little brother or Feng Cang\u2019s little brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang not giving him face like this in front of Ming Yue Cheng, made Wanyan Yi very angry. If it wasn\u2019t because Ming Yue Cheng was here and Wanyan Yi was having ideas about him; wanting to get support from Ming Yue Cheng, that was why he needed to maintain his image, he would have long gone to Wanyan Kang and beat him.</p><br/><p>Seeing these brothers picking at each other mutually, Ming Yue Cheng poured a mouthful wine into his mouth. The way he looked at Wanyan Yi sharpened.</p><br/><p>1. Gongzi: young master</p><br/><p>2. Zhen: I, used by the emperor</p><br/><p>3. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Wake up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er1 shook Mu Yu Die till she woke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat has happened? Why are they all dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, save me! Princess, save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Chou er, who was dressed like Wanyan Bao Zhu, Mu Yu Die tightly held onto her arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, many people have died. Let\u2019s leave quickly. Let\u2019s get away from here. Princess, let\u2019s leave quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Mu Yu Die\u2019s silly appearance, Chou er shook her head at Zhao Lang. It seemed that they won\u2019t be getting anything out of Mu Yu Die. Now, what she wanted to know the most were: Where did Murong Qi Qi go? And why are these people dead?</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, save me! Very scary! Princess, save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die held onto Chou er\u2019s arm and didn\u2019t want to let go. Zhao Lang walked over and hit Mu Yu Die at her neck. She immediately fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Lang, why did the situation become like this? Didn\u2019t we use the soft fragrance powder? How did Murong Qi Qi escape? What do we do now?! If Feng Cang comes here, we\u2019re finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er\u2019s nagging made Zhao Lang completely angry. He grabbed her shoulder and glared into her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, does Murong Qi Qi know martial arts? Also, did you really put the soft fragrance powder in the incense burner? Did you really give them the antidote? Why does Mu Yu Die\u2019s body have signs of being drugged by the soft fragrance powder?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Zhao Lang didn\u2019t believe her, Chou er almost cried.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did everything exactly how you told me to do them! I personally put the soft fragrance powder into the incense burner. I also personally watched princess and Mu Yu Die take the antidote. There shouldn\u2019t have been anything that went wrong! As for Murong Qi Qi, everyone knows she\u2019s a rubbish. How can a rubbish have martial arts? I also don\u2019t know how it became like this, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er\u2019s eyes were red. She almost cried loudly. Obviously, they had calculated Murong Qi Qi. All the arrangements were in place. Why did the result become like this?</p><br/><p>Similarly, Zhao Lang\u2019s mood was also very bad. Losing ten underlings at once and they were killed with one stroke, it seemed that they had encountered a high level martial artist. Zhao Lang\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but get a chill. Could this have been done by his enemies? But this doesn\u2019t make sense! Who was it?!</p><br/><p>Chou er stood next to Zhao Lang while biting her lips. Originally, she wanted to come here to see the tragic state of Murong Qi Qi, but now she saw such a scene. At the scene, there weren\u2019t many traces left. Before dying, what did the people on the ground experience?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou let me hide at the princess\u2019s. Now, princess is gone. Yong er knows that I planned all of this. I definitely can\u2019t go back. Zhao Lang, take me away! Seeing so many people have died, I\u2019m very scared!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er suddenly hugged Zhao Lang from behind. Her face rested on his wide back, wanting to seek a trace of warmth. She didn\u2019t expect Zhao Lang to turn around and grab her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, now you and I can\u2019t go away yet. The task his highness the crown prince gave us, isn\u2019t finished yet. If we go away without care, his highness the crown prince will not let us off the hook. By then, we\u2019ll be facing the fate of being wanted and being chased by assassins. Our whole life, we won\u2019t be safe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. As long as I can be with you, no matter what kind of life we\u2019ll be having, I\u2019m willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er simply flew into Zhao Lang\u2019s embrace. Listening to the beating of his strong heart, her anxious heart calmed down a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Lang, take me away! These dead people make me very afraid! As long as you let me stay by your side, even if we wander to the horizons, I\u2019m willing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, you\u2019re very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang hugged Chou er tightly, using his heat to warm her. His voice was very emotional and very gentle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Xin er, you\u2019re willing to follow me, but I\u2019m not willing, ah! I\u2019m not willing to let the woman I love suffer. I also don\u2019t want my Xin er to follow me at roaming and being a wanderer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve rough skin and thick meat. It doesn\u2019t matter if I live hard days. However, Xin er, you can\u2019t, ah! You\u2019re the goddess of my heart, the woman I love the most, how can I let you suffer?! Xin er, do you know, from the first time I saw you, I fell deeply in love with you. At that time, I swore in my heart that I\u2019ll definitely protect you, love you and not let you suffer any grievances!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, my Xin er, ah. How would I be willing to let you suffer and have difficulties\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Must say, Zhao Lang was a master at talking about love. He spoke those melancholic and moving words, making Chou er\u2019s eyes become full with tears of happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Lang, you\u2019re very good to me! Never has someone ever treated me like this! For you, I\u2019m even willing to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Xin er\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang\u2019s thick lips fell onto Chou er\u2019s cheek, letting her falling tears go into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly, in the future, don\u2019t talk about foolish things like death anymore! Could it be you have the heart to leave me alone in this lonely world, living a lonely life? My silly Xin er! I still have to marry you and let you give birth to our children. Don\u2019t say such silly words anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Women, no matter if they\u2019re wise, astute or intelligent and sly; no matter if they\u2019re good and simple-minded or vicious and ruthless, as long as they fell into the strange circle of love, they would lose themselves.</p><br/><p>Like Chou er, a few sweet words from Zhao Lang, she has long forgotten those scary bloody things. She also forgot her name and who she was. Now, in her eyes, in her heart, there\u2019s only this one man, Zhao Lang, as if all the other men on earth have died. Only this man is the best. She completely belongs to him!</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang\u2019s words of love were like a drug, making Chou er lose her reasoning and also let her heart give birth to guilt. She had injured her body. How would she be able to give birth to children?! This man was so good to her and also wanted to give her a bright future. If she doesn\u2019t confess, then she really wouldn\u2019t be able to cross this bridge in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Lang, I have one thing that I didn\u2019t tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er raised her head slowly. With tears in her eyes, she looked at this man in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give birth. Before, I had a miscarriage. The imperial physician said, I\u2019m not able to have any more children\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er felt uneasy. She knew that men were traditional and wanted to continue their line. She can\u2019t give birth; would Zhao Lang still love her? If Zhao Lang abandoned her because of this, what should she do?!</p><br/><p>While Chou er was fearful, Zhao Lang used a more enthusiastic embrace to give her the greatest sense of security.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, my pitiful Xin er. It doesn\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t have children. I only want you. I don\u2019t want children. Besides, I can go search for doctors with you. You\u2019re so good, the heaven will certainly not be willing to let you suffer. It will definitely give us a lovely child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWa\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, the strings of tension inside Chou er\u2019s heart completely broke. That high line of defense, because of this \u2018commitment\u2019, completely collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuwuwu\u2026\u2026I was very scared just now\u2026\u2026wuwuwu\u2026\u2026I was afraid that you wouldn\u2019t want me anymore because of this\u2026\u2026wuwuwu\u2026\u2026. you\u2019re so good\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang\u2019s big hands gently wiped the tears for Chou er.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, the moment you\u2019re in tears, my heart will feel pain! Don\u2019t cry anymore, my Xin er! Tell me, who has hurt you like this? I\u2019ll go kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>When saying those words, Zhao Lang truly emitted a cold aura, making Chou er feel a burst of gratitude. More and more, she felt that she had chosen the right man.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Murong Qi Qi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er gritted her teeth while saying Murong Qi Qi\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe made me like this! She not only killed my child, but also killed my mother! Murong Qi Qi and I have so much hatred that we can\u2019t live under the same sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er\u2019s eyes burned with flames of hatred. Zhao Lang revealed a smile of success for only a moment. Chou er didn\u2019t see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s her! That bitch! I definitely won\u2019t let her off! I want her blood as revenge for Xin er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang\u2019s words surely made Chou er get rid of those ideas of just now about wandering to the horizons with him. Just thinking about her situation which was caused by Murong Qi Qi, Chou er once again burned with the thought of finding Murong Qi Qi for revenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Can\u2019t let her off! I want to personally kill her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she said that, but today Murong Qi Qi escaped once again, making Chou er\u2019s confidence reduce to the minimum once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Lang, what should I do? Why is her luck so good that she escapes every time? Now that princess has died, I lost my cover identity. What should I do to be able to kill Murong Qi Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Chou er finally mentioned the main topic, Zhao Lang felt relieved. Damn it. I flattered her for so long and wasted so much saliva, finally this woman is coaxed! This was what Zhao Lang was thinking in his heart.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the great cause of crown prince, he wouldn\u2019t have exhausted himself in coaxing Chou er to happiness. Seeing Chou er\u2019s face full of a moved expression, Zhao Lang sneered in his heart. However, his face became more and more gentle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve a plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhao Lang took a very thin human mask out of his sleeve and put it on Chou er. Then he handed her a small bronze mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the mirror, where was there still Chou er\u2019s face? It\u2019s obviously Wanyan Bao Zhu!</p><br/><p>Chou er covered her mouth. She was stunned. Her fingers touched her face. She looked left and right for half a day and couldn\u2019t find even the slightest mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, I had the thought of getting rid of the princess and let you replace her. So, I made a human skin mask. Now, it seems that my preparations were necessarily. Letting you stay at her side, you\u2019ve suffered! Xin er, now you have become the princess, alright? My Xin er is much better at being a princess than Wanyan Bao Zhu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, Chou er truly worships Zhao Lang. Earlier, Zhao Lang let her get to understand Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s habits and characteristics more. He also let her imitate Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s tone and movements. It seems, he has long arranged this for her!</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Lang, today you let me wear the same clothes as princess. Is it that you\u2019d long had the thought of getting rid of her? Even if this matter didn\u2019t happen, you\u2019d have still find a way for me to become princess?\u201d</p><br/><p>The new identity made Chou er very happy. She never imagined that Zhao Lang would be so good to her. Princess! This identity had always been out of reach for Chou er. It\u2019s undoubtedly a great temptation!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Xin er is smart! Even if today\u2019s matter succeeded, I also hid some people in the woods outside the city. There, they\u2019ll get rid of Wanyan Bao Zhu and let you take her place as princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang pulled off all the accessories from Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s head and put them on Chou er.</p><br/><p>\u201cChou er, remember, from today on, you\u2019re Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Bao Zhu and is below one person and above thousands of people. No one will dare to bully you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thought of her transforming into a princess, made Chou er very excited. While being excited, her brows furrowed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Lang, when Wanyan Bao Zhu died, was Murong Qi Qi also present? If Murong Qi Qi saw Wanyan Bao Zhu die; now that a new Wanyan Bao Zhu appeared, will she expose me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er\u2019s question was also what Zhao Lang was worried about. If nothing happened to Murong Qi Qi, then this matter was quite mysterious. However, even if it\u2019s like that, he still wanted to take the bet.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, maybe the matter is not as complicated. We can take the gamble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang leaned towards Chou er\u2019s ears and told her that. Chou er\u2019s expression turned much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really useful? I\u2019m very worried!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest at ease, I\u2019ll be waiting outside for you. If something happens to you, give me a signal! Even if it depends on my life, I\u2019ll still save you! Besides, don\u2019t we not have a witness?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang gave Chou er a bamboo tube and hugged Chou er.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, our happiness depends on you! As long as we help crown prince get rid of Feng Cang, I\u2019ll be able to use the crown prince\u2019s power to become the chief of the martial word. Then, I\u2019ll give you a grand wedding in front of the world. I want you to become the happiest bride in this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Have to say, Zhao Lang was weaving a beautiful dream for Chou er. A woman who had lost her head because of love, indulged in the lies of a man, and unable to extricate themselves out it. For example, Chou er, who was willing to dedicate all of her just because of a few empty words from Zhao Lang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er nodded with happy tears. Although she suffered those tragic things in the past, but the heavens didn\u2019t treat her badly. Finally, she had met Zhao Lang, the man who truly loved her.</p><br/><p>After the two pulled their thoughts together for some time, Chou er and Zhao Lang went with Mu Yu Die to the city\u2019s entrance. When they entered, Chou er woke Mu Yu Die up.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die\u2019s eyes was confused. She looked at Chou er and then looked at Zhao Lang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Die, this is young master Zhao. Don\u2019t you remember? We were robbed by bad people. It\u2019s this young master Zhao who saved us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er held Mu Yu Die\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, it was thanks to young master Zhao, otherwise, we\u2019ll now be at another place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er\u2019s words brought back a little of Mu Yu Die\u2019s memories. She immediately shouted while clutching her own head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No! Killing people! No!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chou er clutched Mu Yu Die\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Die, look at my eyes. We\u2019re alright now! We are safe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re safe\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die looked innocently at Chou er.</p><br/><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Miss Mu, you\u2019re safe now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Probably because Zhao Lang\u2019s voice had that kind of masculine calmness, which made Mu Yu Die calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, we were saved! We\u2019re safe!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying these two sentences, Mu Yu Die\u2019s tears fell.</p><br/><p>Seeing Mu Yu Die like this, Zhao Lang gave Chou er a meaningful glance and apologized to the two: \u201cSince you two are safe now, I\u2019ll go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Zhao! Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Chou er was comforting Mu Yu Die, she watched Zhao Lang left.</p><br/><p>(Note from the author: in the next chapters, Wanyan Bao Zhu will be used when referring to Chou er)</p><br/><p>Only after coaxing for a long time, did Mu Yu Die calm down. Wanyan Bao Zhu supported Mu Yu Die. The two asked the whole way on how to go back. Only in the evening did they arrive back at the residence. Just at that moment, Feng Cang, with a group of people, was about to go find them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye2, princess and miss Mu are found!\u201d</p><br/><p>One person who saw Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die, immediately reported.</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang heard that, he rushed over. He grabbed Wanyan Bao Zhu and dragged her in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay! Where did you bring Murong Qi Qi to? Why hasn\u2019t she come back? What did you do to her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The coldness emitting from Feng Cang made Wanyan Bao Zhu shudder. And that pair of flirtatious eyes, at this time was now cold and bone-piercing, making Wanyan Bao Zhu unable to dare face him. What should she do? What should she do? Wanyan Bao Zhu was very scared. Although previously, Zhao Lang said everything was fine, but now facing Feng Cang, Wanyan Bao Zhu still feared; feared that he would see through her identity, feared that she would die at Feng Cang\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay something!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wanyan Bao Zhu shivering, Feng Cang lost patience. His big hands directly grabbed Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s neck and lifted her up in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, he went to see the venue of the tournament and came back a bit late. He didn\u2019t expect that when he came back to Meixiang yuan3, he got to know from Su Yue that Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die had invited Murong Qi Qi out and still haven\u2019t returned.</p><br/><p>The moment he heard this, he got anxious. He knew very well what kind of personality Wanyan Bao Zhu had. Everyone knew that woman\u2019s attitude towards Murong Qi Qi. Inviting Murong Qi Qi out certainly wouldn\u2019t be a good thing. As for Mu Yu Die, she\u2019s also not a person with good character. Feng Cang really hated himself for being soft-hearted and letting Mu Yu Die stay.</p><br/><p>It so happened that today, Feng Cang went out with Jixiang. No one kept eyes on Wanyan Bao Zhu and these two took advantage of the loophole.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeke\u2026\u2026ke\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s feet swung in the air. Her hands wanted to break Feng Cang\u2019s big hand, but she couldn\u2019t get any energy. Zhao Lang, Zhao Lang! Wanyan Bao Zhu screamed for Zhao Lang in her heart. Zhao Lang, why do you still not come save me?! I\u2019m dying!</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, have mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Wanyan Kang saw this, he stepped forward to plead for Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, where is cousin-in-law? Say something, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s breathing became heavier. She could feel that Feng Cang really wanted to kill her. Even with Wanyan Kang at one side, Feng Cang would completely disregard her current identity of princess and kill her. If something happened to Murong Qi Qi\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>For the first time ever, did Wanyan Bao Zhu hope that Murong Qi Qi was alive. If Murong Qi Qi was safe and sound, she would have a chance to continue living with this identity. If something had happened to Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang would definitely let her go accompany Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t want to die! After so much hardship, she got a new identity and would be able to start a new life; after so much hardship, she found a man she truly loves and has found her goal; she doesn\u2019t want to die like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! I really don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu cried and prayed that nothing happened to Murong Qi Qi. She must be safe and sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling, many people, a lot of blood! Killing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when Wanyan Bao Zhu felt her soul was about to leave and go see the Jade emperor, Mu Yu Die, at one side, began to shout.</p><br/><p>The Jade emperor is the ruler of heaven</p><br/><p>\u201cMany people died! A lot of blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Murong Qi Qi? Did Murong Qi Qi die?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he heard Mu Yu Die\u2019s words, Feng Cang\u2019s hand loosened. Wanyan Bao Zhu fell onto the ground. Feng Cang rushed to Mu Yu Die like the wind. He grabbed her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, where is Murong Qi Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of blood! A lot of blood,\u201d Mu Yu Die shouted and fainted.</p><br/><p>Seeing Mu Yu Die like this, Feng Cang roared: \u201cJin Mo, quickly come here and wake her up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people of Feng Cang had never seen such a wangye. Inside everyone\u2019s memories, Nan Lin wang had always been calm and collected with an appearance of nothing had to do with him. Even with an enemy in front of him, he could still laugh and never put anyone in his eyes. But today, Feng Cang let the people see his other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, miss Mu was shocked and her head is in a mess. Temporarily we can\u2019t ask her anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s face was very gloomy. The people around him were afraid to make a sound, fearing that with a little movement, they would anger this Nan Lin wang and bring trouble to themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cSearch! Order the eagle group to go search! Meng Tian Qi, mobilize the entire army of Yongzhou and find princess Zhao Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang turned his face. Cold eyes swept over Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWanyan Bao Zhu, if we can\u2019t find princess Zhao Yang, benwang4 will let you get a taste of what living is more painful than death is!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the streets, in front of the citizens, Feng Cang showed his intention to kill Wanyan Bao Zhu, making everyone surprised. What kind of holy person is this princess Zhao Yang to let Feng Cang lose control like this\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cZeze, interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far away, a man saw this scene and revealed a strange smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo investigate princess Zhao Yang. I\u2019d like to know what kind of woman can let demon wang Feng Cang become like this!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

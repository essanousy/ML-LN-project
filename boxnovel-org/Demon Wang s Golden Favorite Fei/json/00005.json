Warm. Bleeding. Murong Xin Lian\u2019s anger got to another level! Murong Qing Lian\u2019s wounds would stop swelling with some cream but the wounds on her own face were the real deal. If it left a scar, she was afraid that her looks would really be ruined!</p><br/><p>After thinking that Murong Qin Lian didn\u2019t even care about sisterhood and destroyed her looks that she cared the most about, Murong Xin Lian was also no longer merciful.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian began to be serious. Murong Qing Lian was also not easy to deal with. She humphed coldly and also come up with her real skills. Since Murong Xin Lian ruined her face, she would also destroy Murong Xin Lian\u2019s face!</p><br/><p>\u201cPing pingpang pang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two see Murong Qi Qi\u2019s Cui Zhu yuan 1 as a battlefield. Wherever they went, they would smash down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, ah! My Cui Zhu yuan, ah! Don\u2019t fight anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wailing continuously transmitted into Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian\u2019s ears. It\u2019s ear-piercing and also let them pay more devotion and wrecked more things.</p><br/><p>At the other side, Murong Qi Qi separated Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu with difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, go persuade them quickly. Let them not fight anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expression looked really pitiful. Her demeanour was also out of place. While looking at Murong Qi Qi, Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu couldn\u2019t help but humph coldly. In their hearts, they thought that third miss was really a good-for-nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird miss, the matter of the masters, we, slaves, cannot interfere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui fiercely glared once at Zhen Zhu and then straightened her clothes and hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better watch at the side! Swords have no eyes. Be careful not to hurt yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, But if they continue like this, I\u2019m afraid that if daddy knew, he would be angry\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi lowered her head. Her hands were tugging at the handkerchief.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he investigated the reason, then you two would also be punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi gentle words went into Fei Cui\u2019s and Zhen Zhu\u2019s ears and made them immediately understand.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, today second miss and fourth miss caused such trouble, Murong Tai would not only rebuke one of the misses, he would only put the blame on them (FC and ZZ). At that time, the ones who would be suffering was them.</p><br/><p>Thinking till there, Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu left Cui Zhu yuan one after another. They hurriedly went to search for savers. The two left in a hurry and didn\u2019t notice the strange smile on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, Su Yue, guard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s sentences were short. Su Mei and Su Yue understood that she was going to give some people a hard time. They immediately looked at the door. Fortunately, Cui Zhu yuan was originally a remote place and there were only them two who were serving. After Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu left, there were only five people here.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian had their hands full of fighting each other, when will they still have the time to bother with Murong Qi Qi? They were even more unaware of the strange atmosphere around them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSi\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>A slim and sharp sound came out of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips. The sound reached Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian\u2019s ears. The two acted as though they had heard the same command. Their eyes gradually turned red. All the resentment and jealousy they had towards the other seemed like firewood had encountered a fire. The more it burned, the more intense it became.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi smiled. She looked again and the two people\u2019s eyes had resumed clear, but the attacks became more vicious. Every attack was to take the other\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Envy, jealousy and hate, the sources of all evil!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi sat in the rocking chair and leisurely watched the fighting Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian. If you had no resentment in your heart, this opportunity wouldn\u2019t have been given to me. The debt you owe this body, today pay fully for it back!</p><br/><p>When Murong Tai rushed over, he hadn\u2019t stepped into Cui Zhu yuan yet when he heard Murong Qi Qi\u2019s pitiful voice: \u201cSecond big sister, fourth little sister, don\u2019t fight anymore! We are all sisters, what can we not talk about?! Second big sister, don\u2019t, ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai rushed inside. He saw Murong Qi Qi clutching her chest and gasping on the ground and Murong Xin Lian glaring fiercely at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish, don\u2019t need you to intervene! Today, I\u2019m going to kill this bitch! If you keep meddling, I\u2019ll kill you first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRebel! Everyone is rebelling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his two dishevelled and full of bloodstains daughters, Murong Tai almost couldn\u2019t breath.</p><br/><p>He was originally in a meeting with the Li family\u2019s eldest young master, Li Yun Qing. He didn\u2019t expect Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu to rush in at the same time while yelling for help for their misses, making Murong Tai so angry that he had almost passed out. Now that he had come to Cui Zhu yuan, saw the wrecked look of the yuan and then, after seeing his two daughters\u2019 sorry figures, Murong Tai became really furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai\u2019s left hand grabbed Murong Xin Lian\u2019s whip. His right hand grabbed Murong Qin Lian\u2019s sword. He roared and finally the two stopped fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Murong Qing Lian saw Murong Tai, her eyes immediately turned warm and tears fell down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, look at my face! I\u2019ve been disfigured by her! You must get justice for daughter, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian complain, Murong Xin Lian almost vomited blood. She was about to defend herself when she saw Li Yun Qing standing at one side. There\u2019s an outsider. Murong Xin Lian immediately put on her normally gentle and virtuous appearance. Delicately and pitifully, she stood to the side. She didn\u2019t defend herself. She just let her big tears fall down.</p><br/><p>A genius, ah! Seeing Murong Xin Lian\u2019s \u2018virtuous\u2019 appearance, Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but praise this woman\u2019s acting. If she was in the 21st century, she could even get the Oscar.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because she needed to act like the miserable third miss who had been kicked at the chest, Murong Qi Qi would\u2019ve grabbed Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hand and awarded her the \u2018Best Performance Award\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his two daughters\u2019 sorry figures which were also stained with blood, Murong Tai frowned. His voice was also extremely severe.</p><br/><p>He knew that these two daughters didn\u2019t get along with each other. He just saw it as girls\u2019 \u2018competition\u2019. It\u2019s no big deal. But today, he clearly felt strong murderous intent from the two. This shouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s second big sister who began! She is jealous of me because I reached level four!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian seemed like she didn\u2019t feel Murong Tai\u2019s unhappy heart. Instead, she continued to pull at his hand and acted like a spoiled child.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, second big sister wounded me. You have to punish her and make her kneel at the shrine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian clearly felt that Murong Tai was really angry, but she couldn\u2019t be like Murong Qing Lian and throw a tantrum. Murong Qing Lian was a talent at learning martial arts. She\u2019s only 14 but had already reached level four. In this country which favoured martial arts, she had something to be proud of. Besides, Murong Qing Lian\u2019s mother Liu Yan Zhi gave birth to Murong fu\u2019s2 only male Murong Jun. She had a brother to protect her. That\u2019s why she could speak like this with Murong Tai.</p><br/><p>Thinking till there, Murong Xin Lian knelt in front of Murong Tai.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s daughter\u2019s fault! Daughter originally wanted to play a joke with fourth little sister, but in the end the joke got bigger and bigger and has even alarmed daddy. It\u2019s daughter who is wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong family\u2019s two daughters; one was spoiled, one was gentle. This was the effect that Murong Xin Lian wanted. The more domineering Murong Qing Lian was, the more it showed that she (MXL) was a well-behaved and pleasant person. Even the crowd could see it clearly.</p><br/><p>1.

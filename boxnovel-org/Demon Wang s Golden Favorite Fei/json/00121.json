His phoenix eyes stared at her tearful eyes, \u201cI\u2019m not your brother. We don\u2019t have any blood relations. I\u2019m a child adopted by general and princess! We\u2019re not biological siblings!\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t react to Feng Cang\u2019s words. She sat there blankly. She couldn\u2019t help but reach out her hand and touch Feng Cang\u2019s face. She looked tenderly at him, \u201cBig brother, I know you may not be able to accept this fact at this moment, but it\u2019s impossible to change the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Feng Cang grabbed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand. His eyes showed eagerness, \u201cI told the truth! My surname is not Feng! I\u2019m not your big brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me big brother!\u201d Feng Cang blocked Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips to stop her from calling out those words that made him sad.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi cried harder with Feng Cang being like this. He couldn\u2019t accept this matter. He really couldn\u2019t accept this matter. However, what could they do? Their identity as siblings has been determined. When they would announce it to the world; without doubt, she is Feng Cang\u2019s sister.</p><br/><p>Feeling the wetness on her cheeks, Feng Cang let go of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips. She cried silently and looked so sad, making his heart unable to bear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I\u2019m truly not your big brother. I\u2019m the son of an old friend of general\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Twenty-five years ago, Feng Cang\u2019s parents died in a disaster. It so happened that the child Wanyan Ming Yue gave birth to was just over a month, but because of a cold, he was at the death\u2019s door. Feng Xie brought back the infant Feng Cang. After getting Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s consent, they let Feng Cang become their child and also let him survive under the identity of Feng clan\u2019s eldest young master.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2026\u201d These words coming out of Feng Cang\u2019s mouth were unimaginable to Murong Qi Qi. She even suspected that Feng Cang made up this story to appease her and let her not be sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy original surname was Long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long! Murong Qi Qi thought for a moment. Suddenly, her eyes opened wide and stared at Feng Cang\u2019s face. \u201cEverywhere beneath the sun, there are not many people with the surname Long. The former Qin\u2019s imperial family\u2019s surname was Long\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang gently smiled at Murong Qi Qi for guessing his identity so soon. He pulled her hair on her forehead to the back, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Qing Qing, my identity is the same as the one you\u2019re thinking of!\u201d</p><br/><p>This explosive news almost made Murong Qi Qi faint. Feng Cang was a prince of former Qin? Twenty-five years ago, Feng Cang was born. Twenty-five years ago was also the time the former Qin had been divided into three countries and perished. Then, Feng Cang\u2019s father was the former Qin\u2019s emperor?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi thought for a long time, but didn\u2019t come up with the words to describe Feng Cang\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe remaining evil element of former Qin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi laughed at the Feng Cang\u2019s description of himself. Although she didn\u2019t know why Feng Xie took Feng Cang in during that turbulent time, but there must have been a reason!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye,1 you\u2019re no lying to me, right?\u201d Because of her smile, most of the sadness disappeared from Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face. Her small nose was red. Because of her crying, the skin around her eyes was also red.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m really not your big brother!\u201d Seeing Murong Qi Qi happy, Feng Cang also slowly put down his worries.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your real identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know why, although Murong Qi Qi wanted to continue doubting his words, but the trust she had in Feng Cang let her put all her uncertainties and hesitations into her stomach and didn\u2019t say them out loud. Believe him! That was the voice coming from the bottom of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good. Let me tell you slowly.\u201d Feng Cang laughed at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s impatience. He tickled her red nose and wiped her tears for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy biological father was the former Qin\u2019s crown prince Long Yu. My birth mother was Dong Lu\u2019s princess Xia Wan Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that former Qin\u2019s crown prince Long Yu and Dong Lu\u2019s princess Xia Wan Ying were married. Also, the two had met in private before marrying. Long Yu brimmed over with talent. Xia Wan Ying was beautiful and touching. Gifted scholar and beautiful lady. They fell in love at first sight. Originally, it was a beautiful story. However, later, a series of misfortunes happened.</p><br/><p>Gifted scholar and beautiful lady: a pair of ideal lovers</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, not only did the state head Ming Bu Zhi have the thoughts to revolt, he also whispered in my grandfather\u2019s ears and told him that there were only few women like my mother. Grandfather liked beauties and was naturally moved. Before the marriage, he used the reason that the rebels were encircling and sent my father away (to combat the rebels). He then kidnapped the Dong Lu princess,,, who had come for a marriage alliance, into the palace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026,\u201d Listening here, Murong Qi Qi screamed. \u201cThat old emperor truly had no shame! That was his daughter-in-law! That was the crown princess, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi saying this, Feng Cang could only laugh bitterly. He kissed that cinnabar mole on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father couldn\u2019t accept the fact that his wife had changed into his consort mother. With the support of great general Wanyan Zhi, he wanted to force the emperor to abdicate and get his wife back. He didn\u2019t imagine that this was a trap set by others.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather suddenly died. State head Ming Bu Zhi, the minister of personnel Longze Lan and great general Wanyan Zhi ganged together. Using the reason that my father had committed treason, they attacked my father. My father died protecting my mother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what happened to your mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening till here, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart was beating very fast. She could completely imagine the scene of the crown prince who lived for love, protecting his wife. Those who were hateful, were those people who calculated them. They were truly sinister and careful! Without any sense of shame and they were despicable!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mother hid among the commoners. It was a servant of Feng family who hid her and saved her life. General and my biological father were friends. In the past, general, my father and Wanyan Lie; the three grew up together. Their relationship was the best. However, the ambition of Wanyan family to usurp the throne had been kept from general and my father\u2026Later when my father was met with calamity, general blamed himself. After recognizing my mother, he protected her all the way. At that time, my mother was already pregnant with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt so happened that I was born only less than an hour after your big brother. Later, when your big brother passed away, the general was in love with princess and came down to the reasoning of keeping me. Plus, the fact that princess was a reasonable person and felt very guilty about her father and brother for usurping the throne. So, she protected me and kept me at her side with the identity of her son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was only a few sentences, but Murong Qi Qi knew how much danger and hardship was inside this. \u201cAt last, what happened to your mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi ask about Xia Wan Ying, Feng Cang\u2019s thick eyelashes blocked the waves in his eyes. \u201cDo you remember the pagoda to drive away evil spirits? The former Qin perished. The imperial treasure disappeared. When the army broke into the Forbidden City, that huge wealth seemed like it had disappeared from the face of earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore grandfather died, the only ones who were with him were my parents. My father died at the hands of a thousand arrows. So, Wanyan Zhi thought that only my mother would know about the whereabouts of the treasure. So, he ordered the arrest of my mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough there was the protection of great general and princess, my mother knew that if the people found her at Feng residence, she would certainly bring trouble to general and princess. Besides, maybe she would also bring calamity to me. So, she took advantage of the night and ran away. In the end, she was caught at the Buddha Temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard general say, in order to avoid herself being insulted, my mother bit her tongue and committed suicide. Wanyan Zhi released rumors that my mother was a nine-tailed fox and burned my mother\u2019s body. Because of this, there\u2019s now the pagoda to drive away evil spirits\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A heavy quietness covered the surroundings. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart ached so much that she was unable to breathe. Why, why was it like this? Murong Qi Qi tightly embraced Feng Cang. Just now, she clearly saw the tears at the corners of Feng Cang\u2019s eyes. Sorrow, pain, sadness; nothing was enough to describe Feng Cang\u2019s mood now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, sorry\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice choked. She ached, ached for such a Feng Cang, ached for what Feng Cang had experienced.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the instigation of Ming Bu Zhi; if the emperor of former Qin didn\u2019t get devious thoughts, maybe the former Qin wouldn\u2019t have perished. Maybe, crown prince Long Yu would have ascended the throne and Feng Cang would have become crown prince and would\u2019ve also been a great crown prince\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s head buried in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s chest. Although he had been holding back, but the stubborn tears still couldn\u2019t help but fall from his eyes.</p><br/><p>Since he got to know his history, he never dared to recall and was afraid to remember. He was afraid that if he\u2019d remembered the experience of his parents, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back and cry. So, he had been holding back and never showed anyone. Now, he felt Murong Qi Qi\u2019s warmth, listening to her heartbeat and her voice full of affection and love, the last line of defense in Feng Cang\u2019s heart collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang tried very hard to restrain himself and didn\u2019t let himself cry. A real man doesn\u2019t easily cry, merely because they didn\u2019t encounter heartbreaking things.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here!\u201d Murong Qi Qi gently stroked Feng Cang. Her small face pasted on his hair and felt the trembling from her embrace. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart also trembled.</p><br/><p>Why was fate playing with people like this? Why did Feng Cang had such a past? How great would it be if Feng Xie didn\u2019t tell Feng Cang any of this! Knowing that he would be sad, why did he have to tell him the truth and let him bear with all these things?!</p><br/><p>Now, Murong Qi Qi finally understood where the melancholy of Feng Cang came from. In the past, she thought that melancholy was because of Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue. Today, she got to know that deep in this man\u2019s heart, sad secrets were hidden. Such a sorrowful past made his eyes get coated in a layer of sadness, which people were unable to ignore.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, then your fetal poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fetal poison was originally in my mother\u2019s body. I think, it has something to do with Dong Lu. Dong Lu\u2019s empress has always been a female disciple of Penglai Island. My biological maternal grandmother passed away when my mother was young. Later, maternal grandfather married a junior sister of my maternal grandmother and made her empress. After that, my mother\u2019s body became sickly. It was just, she didn\u2019t expect that she would get poisoned\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Complex imperial relations! Murong Qi Qi had long felt that there was something strange about the poison in Feng Cang\u2019s body. It wasn\u2019t a poison of the mainland. She didn\u2019t expect that it truly had something to do with Penglai Island!</p><br/><p>It was just, why did people\u2019s heart needed to be so vicious! Why did they need to be so cruel? Why did they need to struggle for power? Why should they want things that originally didn\u2019t belong to them? Is human nature good or evil? Is a human\u2019s heart complicated or simple? Why did they need to create so many tragedies and let Feng Cang bear all these alone?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye!\u201d A never before emotion poured into Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart. She knew now why Feng Cang didn\u2019t announce at the palace hall that they weren\u2019t siblings. Because his identity was complicated and involved former Qin.</p><br/><p>If Bei Zhou\u2019s, Xi Qi\u2019s and Nan Feng\u2019s authorities got to know that there was still a bloodline of former Qin\u2019s imperial family, then what Feng Cang has to face will be the assassinations by three countries! Those people who won the power and divided the world, how could they allow a person with the blood of the former Qin\u2019s imperial family to stay alive?!</p><br/><p>Naturally, the less people knew about Feng Cang\u2019s identity, the better it was. If it was exposed, then it would bring him unprecedent assassinations\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, do you know? When princess was pregnant with you, she and general promised me, if it\u2019s a girl, they would let her be my bride.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, you were in princess\u2019s belly. When the fetus moved, she often let me listen to your voice at her belly. While I listened, princess would tell me, this is your little bride, yo! At that moment, I felt so happy, so happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, when you took down Water Moon Mirror, my heart almost stopped. How come you\u2019re so beautiful?!\u201d When Feng Cang raised his head once again, the wetness in his eyes disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that moment, I thought it was the grace from heaven! I thought you went with general and princess. I didn\u2019t expect you to still be alive in this world and also lived with me and be loved by me! No matter if it was a marriage set by the parents or the feelings of love that grew between us after getting to know each other, in the end, you\u2019re still my Qing Qing and became my bride. Don\u2019t you think our fate is rooted deeply and nothing could cut it off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know what language she should use to express her feelings now. She lowered her head and kissed Feng Cang\u2019s forehead for the first time. This was something Feng Cang loved to do the most. It\u2019s said if a man likes to kiss your forehead, it meant that you\u2019re the most treasured person in his heart. Being loved by him for so long, now, let her be the one to love him!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you call me husband, I\u2019ll be happier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang kissed Murong Qi Qi, pried her lips open and explored her fragrance.</p><br/><p>Without the status of siblings to pressure her, the burden in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart was completely put down. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t reject Feng Cang\u2019s kiss. Like a small bird, she nestled in Feng Cang\u2019s arms. Her small hands were on his shoulders and she gently took the initiative to respond to his gentleness.</p><br/><p>Two people with the same life experience found a point of resonance in the other\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The two were orphans and their parents died. Besides, their parents had been calculated by others and died tragic deaths at the hands of the wicked. Feng Cang\u2019s frankness completely shattered the obstacle between them. This pair of lovers kissed like they were drunk, as if they looked forward to this kiss for a century.</p><br/><p>Only when Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small face became red and breathless, Feng Cang let go of her.</p><br/><p>The misunderstanding had been unlocked. The pressure stone in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart disappeared. So, her mood was good. Her smile also brought a taste of sweetness and happiness.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Murong Qi Qi remembered one thing. She looked serious at him, \u201cWangye, you didn\u2019t make up a story to lie to me just because you like me, right?! I\u2019m not against love between siblings, but siblings are close relatives. The child born from them wouldn\u2019t be healthy and is prone to deformity!</p><br/><p>Seeing the doubts on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face, Feng Cang chuckled and tickled Murong Qi Qi\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, could it be that you don\u2019t know, only the former Qin\u2019s imperial family have purple eyes? The grape violet was the most respected and also meant the purest lineage! Otherwise, why would I use every means to cover up my eyes?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree kingdoms divided Qin. Everyone from the former Qin\u2019s imperial family, including babies, have been slaughtered. I\u2019m the only one left. If I\u2019m discovered, what I need to face would then be three countries\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Feng Cang said this, Murong Qi Qi immediately realized Feng Cang\u2019s situation. \u201cWangye, are the people around you reliable?\u201d The people Murong Qi Qi was referring to was those people around Feng Cang and who had seen his purple eyes. If these people were not reliable, then wouldn\u2019t it be trouble?</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was very pleased at Murong Qi Qi being so concerned about him. He took Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand and kissed the back of her hand, \u201cThey\u2019re all my people and won\u2019t betray me. Those who betrayed me have long died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, it\u2019s good,\u201d Murong Qi Qi nestled against Feng Cang. Without the taboo of sibling\u2019s love, Murong Qi Qi returned to her former self. \u201cWangye, then what do you want? Do you want to be emperor? Do you want to restore Qin dynasty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Feng Cang shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t all men have a special obsession with power?\u201d Murong Qi Qi sat up and looked at Feng Cang with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I\u2019m only obsessed with you.\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s words had a taste of flirting, making Murong Qi Qi feel shy, \u201cI\u2019m being serious! Could it be that you never thought of getting revenge for your parents? Getting back what belonged to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026,\u201d hearing Murong Qi Qi say that, Feng Cang laughed. His eyes had ten thousand emotions, \u201cIf the country is at chaos, those who would suffer are the commoners. It\u2019s been twenty-five years already since the four countries split the world and coexisted peacefully. If I break this, then I would need to face unprecedented pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, being an emperor may not be the best. Sitting in that position, you would lose your heart and human nature because of power. I don\u2019t want lose myself one day and become that cold and selfish person. Since I don\u2019t like it, I won\u2019t step into this circle of problems. The more you want, the more you would lose. I don\u2019t want to lose what I already have, such as you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, if Qing Qing want to be the most noble woman in this world, for you, I\u2019m willing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want!\u201d Murong Qi Qi shook her head and leaned on Feng Cang\u2019s chest, \u201cJust now, I was worried, worried that wangye would have thoughts to revive the dynasty; worried that wangye was obsessed with power and desired riches. Now, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I don\u2019t want the nobleness you said. I only want to be with the person I love and spend the rest of our life in peace. Grow old together and never separate!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

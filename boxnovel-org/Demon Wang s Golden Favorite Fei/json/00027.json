But just the thought of Zheng Min\u2019s tragic death and the shame that it brought her, the way Murong Xin Lian looked at Fei Cui became darker.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, this slave really didn\u2019t do anything, really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing Murong Xin Lian\u2019s intention to kill, Fei Cui quickly knelt down and kowtowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, I\u2019ve served you for so many years, even if there\u2019s no credit but there\u2019s hard work! Second miss, this slave has never betrayed you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui, what do mean, ah?! Do you mean that our miss slandered you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei isn\u2019t happy hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was it that knelt in front of our miss and said that its second miss who forced you to do that thing that happened that year; it\u2019s second miss who took that glowing pearl and that you were completely forced? Fei Cui, the words you said don\u2019t not admit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, Su Mei!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue who has been silent for the whole time finally opened her mouth to help.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat year she can betray her master for second miss, now she can also betray second miss for our miss. There\u2019s no need to talk about justification with such person. She is just someone who doesn\u2019t have spine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s reasoning has disappeared with Su Mei and Su Yue\u2019s talks. She rushed to Fei Cui and kicked her in the chest. Fei Cui\u2019s body immediately flew like a disconnected kite against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Blood came from Fei Cui\u2019s mouth. She looked incredibly at Murong Xin Lian. She followed this second miss for five years. She has never thought that her loyalty would pay such an outcome.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond little , what are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Murong Jun\u2019s voice came over. The next moment, he appeared in front of Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui, Fei Cui, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung, young master?\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>The person that appeared in front of her made Fei Cui surprised. Why is young master here? Why is he showing a specially caring expression?</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Fei Cui to thin it through, Murong Jun stood up. He looked full of anger at Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Xin Lian, you are too vicious! I\u2019ve already promised Fei Cui to take her as concubine. You actually dare to hurt her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only Fei Cui, Murong Xin Lian is also stunned.</p><br/><p>Why did Murong Jun take a fancy on Fei Cui? Why did he suddenly take Fei Cui as concubine? Can it be that it\u2019s really like what Murong Qi Qi said; it\u2019s Fei Cui who betrayed her, that\u2019s why Murong Qi Qi and Murong Jun overcame the trap? Right, it must be like that!</p><br/><p>A\u2026\u2026. Murong Qi Qi lowered her head but the laughter in her eyes is really strong. She didn\u2019t expect that this big brother knows how to push the boat with the current, nor is he a fool like how the rumors say.</p><br/><p>To push the boat with the current: to take advantage of the situation for one\u2019s own benefit</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that the thing you did is flawless? Murong Xin Lian, you are so vicious! When father come, I\u2019ll let father judge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the blood on Fei Cui\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Cui, you have suffered! If it wasn\u2019t for you, I\u2019m afraid that now I\u2019ll be\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, Fei Cui don\u2019t worry, the thing I promised you, I\u2019ll definitely do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui was never so afraid like now. When did young master get together with third miss? They are doing this, isn\u2019t it like wanting her to die?! Fei Cui immediately broke away from Murong Jun\u2019s embrace and retreated in fear at the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I, I didn\u2019t, I really\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the gloomy Murong Xin Lian come closer and closer, Fei Cui\u2019s eyes showed unprecedented fear. Three men talking makes a tiger, Murong Xin Lian must\u2019ve believed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words!</p><br/><p>Three men talking makes a tiger: repeated rumor becomes a fact</p><br/><p>\u201cSlut!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian didn\u2019t listen to Fei Cui. A kick again on Fei Cui\u2019s chest. This time, Fei Cui didn\u2019t utter a sound and immediately fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you killed her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun put his finger under Fei Cui\u2019s nose. He felt no breath. Murong Jun was so scared that he sat on the ground. The finger pointing at Murong Xin Lian also began trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou killed her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is only a cheap maid, what about that I killed her?! If big brother really likes her, I\u2019ll give you this dead body!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian glared once at Murong Jun, making him shiver. He immediately got away from Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi seemed like she is unable to bear that Fei Cui fate is like this. She slowly walked to Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister, she and I after all had an owner and slave relationship. Let me bury her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Today she came to calculate with Murong Qi Qi, but in the end the one who was humiliated is herself. Murong Xin Lian really wants to go forward and give Murong Qi Qi a kick like Fei Cui\u2019s. But Murong Jun is here and beside Murong Qi Qi there\u2019s a high skilled martial artist. Murong Xin Lian can only force herself to gulp this anger down. She can take revenge in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want it, I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian said that really coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird little sister really cares about feelings and friendship!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to second big sister, I\u2019m not even close!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi said that modestly. Her face returned to the usual humble and meek expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretend! Keep pretending!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian hasn\u2019t finish talking when she heard: \u201cShengzhi1 has arrived\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Cui Zhu yuan, 2three figures appeared. The one in the front is Jing wang3 Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Longze Jing Tian, Murong Xin Lian\u2019s distorted face immediately became more gentle and full of love. The one who just said that Murong Qi Qi is pretending, now she is pretending, even god will exclaim in admiration.</p><br/><p>Followed behind Longze Jing Tian are Murong Tai and an eunuch.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi accept the decree!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian coldly swept over Murong Qi Qi with a sullen face. He apparently didn\u2019t let go of what happened this morning and was very reluctant to make this trip.</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel, kneel quickly, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that his children is just standing there, Murong Tai got anxious. He went forward, pulled them and shouted \u201cten thousand years\u201d together. They knelt together in front of Lonze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian\u2019s bunch of flowery words, Murong Qi Qi simply didn\u2019t listen to them. She only knows that after this decree fell, she became from Murong fu\u2019s4 third miss to Xi Qi country\u2019s Princess Zhao Yang. In the near future, she will marry to Bei Zhou, marry that Nan Lin wang Feng Cang who people call \u2018demon wang\u2019.</p><br/><p>Really overwhelming, ah! Murong Qi Qi stood up and took over the decree. She glanced at the horizon. Princess? Marry for peace? Ah, this surprise really came in time!</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations third miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian looked at Murong Qi Qi. The way she is looking at the sky is alert. It\u2019s different from the frivolous woman at Duanmu fu this morning. Thinking about the meaning behind this decree and the rumors about that Feng Cang, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s hostility against Murong Qi Qi reduced somewhat. In his heart there\u2019s a hint of sympathy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong 5 is Princess Zhao Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s soul returned to her body. She retrieved her gaze. On her mouth, there\u2019s a shallow smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsking wangye to not call me wrong again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Longze Jing Tian to say something, Murong Qi Qi turned and went back inside the room and left the others hanging in the yard.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai shouted once. Murong Qi Qi not giving face to Longze Jing Tian like this, made Murong Tai feel very embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Footnotes:</p><br/><p>1.

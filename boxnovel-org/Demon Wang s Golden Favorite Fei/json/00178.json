The attacks would occur on a regular basis every day. As the time went by, the attacks became longer. Before, it was only a slight trembling. Now, when the attacks are happening, he couldn\u2019t hold things anymore. He wouldn\u2019t even be able to hold a cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye1, princess and I came from a famous master. Princess\u2019s medical skills are a level above mine! Telling princess sooner would also benefit you, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless!\u201d Feng Cang smiled helplessly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that this is the residual effects of the gu?! The gu was transferred to Qing Qing\u2019s body. Without the restrain of the gu poison, the fetal poison began to behave unscrupulously. Only Penglai Island has the cure for the fetal poison. Qing Qing also can\u2019t help!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang being so stubborn, Jin Mo sighed. \u201cWangye, I said before, between a husband and wife, there should be honesty. Although, perhaps your starting point may be good, but have you ever thought what princess would think? You\u2019re fighting an illness, but she didn\u2019t know. By then, how guilty would she feel and how heartbroken would she be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo said so much in one breath made Feng Cang have a whole new level of respect for him. \u201cJin Mo, I didn\u2019t expect you to know so much about the matters of love! You really can\u2019t tell, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, don\u2019t make more fun of me. Princess is already coming over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo\u2019s voice just fell when Feng Qi Qi was already standing behind Feng Cang. \u201cCang, senior brother, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re betting! Jin Mo said that today I won\u2019t catch any fish. I said that I would definitely catch a big fish for you to nourish your body. Jin Mo didn\u2019t believe it. So, we could only bet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Bet? Good! Do you already know what the bet is?\u201d Feng Qi Qi looked slyly at Jin Mo. \u201cSenior brother, since it\u2019s a bet, you should take out the good things, otherwise, you would be too stingy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo could only smile bitterly seeing this couple echoing one another. \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal! If I lose I will tell you a secret about wangye. If I win, wangye need to promise me one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Jin Mo say this, Feng Cang knew he was playing tricks. No matter if he loses or wins, Jin Mo would tell Feng Qi Qi about the residual effects of the gu. Now, she is pregnant. If she is scared and frightened because of his matter and hurt the baby in her belly, then, what should he do?</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Mo, why don\u2019t we change the stakes?! If you lose, then jump in the sea as food for the fishes. If I loses, I will jump. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was obviously stopping Jin Mo from telling Feng Qi Qi, but Jin Mo\u2019s duty was to take care of Feng Cang. This time, he refused to compromise. For a time, these two began to exchange glares and ignored Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you to having a secret?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi had long discovered that there was something wrong with these two men. Now, they were full of \u2018tender feelings\u2019 and \u2018casted amorous glances\u2019 at each other, making Feng Qi Qi even more sceptical. She took one step forward and separated Feng Cang and Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, what is the matter?\u201d Feng Qi Qi crossed her shoulders and make a strong impression with her belly. She looked at Feng Cang, wanting to find some clues from his handsome face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing is the matter\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang laughed charmingly. He wanted to hold Feng Qi Qi\u2019s waist, but was avoided by her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, you tell me! What is Cang hiding from me?\u201d Feng Qi Qi couldn\u2019t find the answer from Feng Cang, so, she looked for it from Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang did a \u2018shut up\u2019 gesture behind Jin Mo. Although, Jin Mo wanted to say, but after all Feng Cang was his master. He couldn\u2019t violate the will of his master. He could only smilingly play dumb. \u201cJunior sister, I was joking with you! What secret can wangye have?! Could you not know what kind of man he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>These two people seemed to have conspired with each other. Their mouths are so sealed. Feng Qi Qi wanted to find out the reason, but no one cooperated. She had no way about where to start.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, come, sit here! Drink water\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang helped Feng Qi Qi sit down and poured water. Just as he lifted the teacup, his hand suddenly began to shake. \u2018Kuangdang\u2026\u2019 The teacup fell on the deck and broke into several pieces.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang paled. Then, he hid his hand in his sleeve. \u201cHaha, the storm is really big\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang smiled softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no storm!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s abnormal behaviour was keenly captured by Feng Qi Qi. She stood up and walked to Feng Cang. She reached out and grabbed his hand but was avoided by Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t burn. you don\u2019t have to worry!\u201d Feng Cang took a step back. He hadn\u2019t retreated yet, when Feng Qi Qi flipped out. \u201cStop! Reach out your hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who were used to Feng Qi Qi\u2019s gentleness had been frightened by her sudden \u2018lion roar\u2019. Even Feng Cang was startled. Feng Qi Qi quickly walked to him and grabbed Feng Cang\u2019s hand. When Feng Cang\u2019s trembling hand came out of his sleeve, Feng Qi Qi\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cWhat had happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi habitually placed her fingers on Feng Cang\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Qing Qing. Jin Mo already made medicine for me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Feng Qi Qi shouted. Feng Cang understood that she was really angry this time. Seeing that Feng Qi Qi\u2019s face was so grim, Feng Cang stood well-behavedly for the first time in front of Feng Qi Qi. He was like a child who did something wrong and motionlessly waited to be \u2018reprimanded\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>After checking one hand, Feng Qi Qi replaced it with the other.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt began the first time I met Misha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt had been so long?\u201d Feng Qi Qi frowned. After checking, Feng Qi Qi turned and faced Jin Mo. \u201cSenior brother, what is your opinion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the residual effects of the gu. Although, the gu poison had been induced in your body, but without the restrain of the gu poison, the fetal poison began to behave unscrupulously. This is also why wangye\u2019s Forget Love acted in advance and the amnesia happened sooner than expected.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s thoughts coincided with that of Jin Mo. She took the medicine Jin Mo made for Feng Cang. Feng Qi Qi put it under her nose and sniffed. When she wanted to try it, she was stopped by Feng Cang and Jin Mo at the same time. Only now did Feng Qi Qi remembered that she is pregnant and that she couldn\u2019t just try medicines. She simply began to discuss the condition of Feng Cang with Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Feng Qi Qi and Jin Mo was discussing in full swing and ignored him completely, Feng Cang felt a bit bitter. It seemed that he really did wrong. This time he really offended Feng Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>After Feng Qi Qi and Jin Mo finished discussing, Jin Mo stood up happily. \u201cJunior sister, I will add the two kinds of herbs you talked about!\u201d After getting the prescription, Jin Mo was like he won a treasure. He left Feng Cang and hurriedly went into the cabin to prepare his new medicine.</p><br/><p>Finally, he got the opportunity. Feng Cang walked to Feng Qi Qi and slowly lowered his body. \u201cQing Qing, I didn\u2019t purposely hide this from you! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! How dare I question the regent\u2019s decision?! As far as the regent is concerned, I\u2019m and outsider. The baby in my belly is also an outsider. That is why, I shouldn\u2019t intervene in your things. You also don\u2019t need my care. You and I are not family. So, there\u2019s no need for you to report everything to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi was really angry. Feng Cang actually didn\u2019t say a thing of such a big matter. According to Jin Mo, Feng Cang\u2019s situation had extended from his hands to his arms. Moreover, the time it happens also extended. This was also why Feng Cang would suddenly put down the matters of the war and wanted to go to Penglai Island sooner.</p><br/><p>Although, Feng Qi Qi could understand that Feng Cang did it for her to not let her be worried, but after it happened, and she got to know the truth, she still couldn\u2019t control her emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I didn\u2019t think so. You\u2019re my wife. How could you have nothing to do with me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m your wife, why did you hide things from me? You told Jin Mo but didn\u2019t tell me. Am I in the first place in your heart?!\u201d While speaking, Feng Qi Qi\u2019s tears began to fall, making Feng Cang more apprehensive.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, it\u2019s my fault. Don\u2019t cry!\u201d Feng Cang wanted to wipe Feng Qi Qi\u2019s tears, but his hand was thrown away by her. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me! I hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said this, Feng Qi Qi stood up and strode back to the cabin.</p><br/><p>Although the scene on the deck made Su Mei and Su Yue didn\u2019t know what to do, but now, after casting a glance once at Feng Cang, the two went into to the cabin to Feng Qi Qi\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang had been standing on the deck. His outstretched hand still held the posture of wiping Feng Qi Qi\u2019s tears. His fingers trembled slightly. This kind of tremor spread from his wrist to his arm.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this time he really made Feng Qi Qi angry! It seemed that this was the first time Feng Qi Qi got angry ever since they\u2019ve met.</p><br/><p>Inside the cabin, Feng Qi Qi\u2019s tears didn\u2019t stop from falling. When Su Mei and Su Yue entered and saw such a Feng Qi Qi, the two went forward and comforted her. \u201cMiss, guye2 didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Guye was afraid that you would worry, affect your emotions and that it would be bad for the baby!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Feng Qi Qi choked with sobs. \u201cI know he did it for my own good, but I\u2019m so sad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Su Yue just sat next to Feng Qi Qi, when Feng Qi Qi threw herself in her (SY) arms. \u201cSu Yue, I\u2019m so useless! I\u2019m a doctor and saved many people but couldn\u2019t cure my own husband! I know that he was afraid that I would worry. So, he kept these from me and didn\u2019t tell me. I know I shouldn\u2019t have gotten angry with him. I was really angry at myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoowoo\u2026I\u2019m so useless. I couldn\u2019t cure him. I\u2019m so useless\u2026woowoo\u2026I blame myself for not having learned enough from master. If I could\u2019ve learned master\u2019s skills, Cang wouldn\u2019t have to endure this pain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that Feng Qi Qi\u2019s sadness wasn\u2019t because Feng Cang kept a secret from her, but it was because of this.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Feng Qi Qi cried like this, Su Yue and Su Mei comforted Feng Qi Qi. \u201cMiss, this isn\u2019t your fault! If there\u2019s someone to blame, it\u2019s the one who poisoned guye! Miss and guye are such good people; why did you had to suffer so many tests and tortures?! It\u2019s really unfair!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Su Mei talked, her eyes also became red. It was Su Yue who was more rational at this time. \u201cMiss, cry! Cry out all the sadness and grievances in your heart! After you cry, you will feel a lot better!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi cried for a long time before she stopped. Seeing Su Mei with red eyes, Feng Qi Qi spoke in a low muffled voice, \u201cSu Mei, why are you crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026,\u201d Su Mei wiped her face. Sure enough, it was a hand full of tears. \u201cLook what happened to me! I wanted to persuade miss. I didn\u2019t expect myself to cry.\u201d Su Mei turned her face and wiped the tears. Then, she brought water for Feng Qi Qi to wash her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, since the things have already happened. Let\u2019s face it together! Now, it\u2019s no longer meaningful to look into who is wrong. After a while, we will arrive at Penglai Island! By then, guye would be cured and you also don\u2019t have to worry anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei wringed the towel and gave it to Feng Qi Qi. \u201cYou cried for so long here. Guye must be very worried outside. Miss, guye is already very remorseful. If you continue to cry, guye would probably jump in the sea!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei\u2019s last sentence amused Feng Qi Qi. After washing her face, Feng Qi Qi felt a lot refreshed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, Su Yue, thank you! After letting out all the low feelings in my heart, I feel a lot better! You\u2019re right. I should be more optimistic! As long as we cure the fetal poison in Cang\u2019s body, the residual left by the gu poison would also be solved!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s mood became better. Su Mei and Su Yue also felt relieved. After the two went out, they discovered Feng Cang outside of the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuye, miss is waiting for you!\u201d Su Mei and Su Yue exchanged a smile. They made way and let Feng Cang enter.</p><br/><p>Before, Feng Cang had been outside of the room. Feng Qi Qi\u2019s cries spread out from the room, making his heart ache a lot. The thought that this was all because he made Feng Qi Qi sad, Feng Cang was very remorseful. He hated himself for not listening to Jin Mo. He should\u2019ve told Feng Qi Qi these sooner. Like that, he wouldn\u2019t have make her sad.</p><br/><p>1. Wangye: the prince of first rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>2. Guye: son-in-law, used by the female\u2019s family \u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

No one ever expected that Yue Lan Zhi would do such a \u2018disgraceful\u2019 thing. He couldn\u2019t think much. Jing De took out a dagger and stabbed Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s back. The sharp blade penetrated through the ribs and stabbed Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s moving heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoom\u2026boom\u2026boom\u2026,\u201d the heartbeat gradually stopped. Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s beautiful eyes were wide open. So much unwillingness, so much hatred; all left the world with her death.</p><br/><p>It was just, even after Yue Lan Zhi died, her teeth didn\u2019t loosen. She still bit fiercely and didn\u2019t have a trace of releasing.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, quickly come and help, fool!\u201d When had Wanyan Lie ever suffered like this? Here, there was only he, Jing De and the young girl. The young girl had been scared so much that she only trembled. Jing De quickly rushed to Wanyan Lie\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Jing De wanted to pry open Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s teeth, but he didn\u2019t have any tools at hand. He could only find a way to break her mouth, but Yue Lan Zhi seemed like even after death she didn\u2019t want to let Wanyan Lie off. Her teeth were fiercely on each other like an imprisoning door. Half of Wanyan Lie\u2019s ear was swallowed in her mouth and she refused to spit it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly go find people to help, you fool!\u201d Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s canine tooth bit through Wanyan Lie\u2019s ear. Blood dripped along his cheek. Seeing that Jing De was so clumsy, Wanyan Lie kicked Jing De\u2019s calf, \u201cQuickly, go find people! Find someone considerate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Yes, yes!\u201d Jing De was sweating from anxiousness. He rushed and trotted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, emperor, are you alright?!\u201d The young girl was very scared. Her tears fell. She only cried and couldn\u2019t do anything else, making Wanyan Lie more and more had the impulse to kill this woman.</p><br/><p>The blood was still dripping. Wanyan Lie was in so much pain that he almost cursed. Suddenly he heard \u2018goo goo goo\u2019 sound coming from far to near. \u201cGoo, goo, goo, goo\u2026\u201d Wanyan Lie was first surprised then he immediately struggled to get up.</p><br/><p>It was clear, his fresh blood attracted the mother gu in Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s belly. Now the mother gu smelled the blood of a living person. It was very excited. It crawled up along Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoo, goo, goo, goo\u2026\u201d that voice was getting nearer and nearer. Wanyan Lie even wanted to die now. F***, why hasn\u2019t Jing De returned yet?! And this damned Yue Lan Zhi was truly a bitch. Even before death, she wanted to calculate him. Truly a bitch!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie struggled to pull out his ear. He didn\u2019t expect his earlobe tore, making him scream in pain. Even more warm blood spilled out. Being afraid of pain, Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t dare to move. However, he didn\u2019t have much time to be hesitant when a tingling pain came from his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ah, ah!\u201d The Wanyan Lie whose end of his ear was bitten by the mother gu screamed. He pulled hard and pulled out the other half of his ear from Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s mouth. Originally, he thought he could be relieved, but the young girl began to scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmp, emperor! Wo\u2026worm\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>On Wanyan Lie\u2019s ear a worm as small as a thumb was climbing. It was so red. That worm clenched tightly at Wanyan Lie\u2019s ear and didn\u2019t let go. Wanyan Lie was in so much pain, he screamed and jumped.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019 Wanyan Lie wanted to hit the mother gu to the ground, but didn\u2019t expect it to be so cunning. As if it sensed danger, it immediately went into Wanyan Lie\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, it, it entered!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl screamed nonstop. Such a scene was truly too horrifying. That meaty and red worm twisted its body and drilled inside along of Wanyan Lie\u2019s ear. When Wanyan Lie wanted to grab the mother gu and pull it out, the mother gu only left a slippery tail. It struggled to get its tail out of Wanyan Lie\u2019s hand. All of sudden, during the struggle it fell onto Wanyan Lie\u2019s brain.</p><br/><p>At this time, Wanyan Lie\u2019s head was rumbling loudly. When Jing De returned with people, Wanyan Lie had been hugging his head and rolling on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, your majesty, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jing De was very anxious and quickly asked the young girl what had happened. The girl had also been scared. She could only say through many breath, \u201cWorm\u2026entered emperor\u2019s ear\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was bad! Hearing this from the young girl, Jing De\u2019s heart jumped. The worm the girl was referring to must be the mother gu. Now the mother gu entered the emperor\u2019s body. What should they do?</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly! Quickly help emperor up!\u201d Jing De was sweating from anxiousness. He could only let people bring Wanyan Lie out of the underground. When the imperial physician arrived, Wanyan Lie had fainted from pain.</p><br/><p>Although Jing De wanted to seal the news that Wanyan Lie had fainted, but there were so many ears everywhere inside the palace. In a short moment, this news reached the empress and consort De. The two immediately rushed over. All the people waited at a side for the result of the examination.</p><br/><p>Five imperial physicians took turns to examine Wanyan Lie. The last one was the old imperial physician.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis majesty disease is really strange!\u201d The old imperial physician narrowed his eyes. After examining for a long time, he raised his head, \u201cEmperor\u2019s ears seemed to have been bitten by someone. Beside his ear is stained with blood. Presumably someone attacked his majesty. The emperor only fainted from pain. It\u2019s nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the empress heard that someone attacked Wanyan Lie and bit his ears like that, she immediately stood up, \u201cJing De, who wanted to assassinate the emperor?\u201d</p><br/><p>This thing became assassination through Li Bing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t wake up yet, so Jing De didn\u2019t know how to answer Li Bing. Seeing Jing De like that, Li Bing immediately put out her attitude of an empress, \u201cJing De, what had happened? Why did the emperor become like this? You don\u2019t want to say anything, could it be you\u2019re the accomplice of the assassin?\u201d</p><br/><p>An accusation of being the \u2018accomplice\u2019 made Jing De shiver. He immediately knelt on the floor, \u201cAnswering niangniang, 1 it was imperial noble consort!\u201d He gritted his teeth and pulled out Yue Lan Zhi who died for a long time as the scapegoat.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoble consort Yue?\u201d Hearing this name, Li Bing\u2019s teeth itched. This woman occupied Wanyan Lie alone, making her (LB) only exist in name and become the joke of the women from the harem. How could she accept this? Now, she finally caught Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s small tail. She must torture Yue Lan Zhi very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d When Lin Ke Xin entered, she didn\u2019t see Yue Lan Zhi. This was a good thing, ah. Yue Lan Zhi attacked the emperor. How big is such a crime, ah?! From the empress\u2019s appearance, it seemed that she wanted to make a chapter out of this thing. Then she should only watch the play!</p><br/><p>\u201cEscaped!\u201d Jing De once again gritted his teeth. Now, Wanyan Lie hasn\u2019t woken up yet. There\u2019s no one who would back up him. Besides, even if the emperor wakes up, he would not have a way to explain this matter. They could only push this matter onto Yue Lan Zhi.</p><br/><p>\u201cEscaped?\u201d The moment Li Bing heard this, she got angry. \u201cServants, seal the palace. Search for the assassin Yue Lan Zhi! If the other party struggles, kill without pardon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Li Bing was not favored, but she\u2019s the empress, she\u2019s the mistress of the harem. Besides, her son is the crown prince, the future emperor. So, no one on at the scene wouldn\u2019t not give her face. Immediately, the palace became busy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The empress dowager Dongfang Lan who had already slept had been woken up by the movement from outside. She immediately called Qing Gu to ask her what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, emperor has been attacked by noble consort Yue. Now, he\u2019s unconscious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a thing happened?\u201d Dongfang Lan was worried about Wanyan Lie\u2019s injury and wanted to go to Long Autumn palace to take a look at him. However, she was stopped by Qing Gu, \u201cMiss, the empress and consort De is already there! You see, in the middle of the night, there\u2019s them who will look over the emperor. Don\u2019t worry. The imperial physician said that the emperor only fainted. Nothing would happen. This slave will go over in your stead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Gu was worried about Dongfang Lan. In such a winter night; also, Long Autumn palace is far from Jinxuan palace. Dongfang Lan is already at such an old age; if she goes over and caught the cold, then it would be bad. Knowing that Qing Gu was being considerate, Dongfang Lan quickly tell her some reminders and let her go to Long Autumn palace to see how the situation was.</p><br/><p>When Qing Gu arrived, Wanyan Lie was still unconscious. Qing Gu came with the empress dowager\u2019s decree; one, was to tell the imperial physicians to heal the emperor. Second was to tell the empress to control the overall situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cChenqie2 will follow the empress dowager\u2019s decree.\u201d With Dongfang Lan\u2019s decree, Li Bing did things more smoothly and easily. Qing Gu said some reminders and was about to leave when she saw the young girl in white clothes. Seeing that this girl looked familiar, Qing Gu walked over. She almost exclaimed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything\u2026I really don\u2019t know anything\u2026,\u201d the young girl had become somewhat silly because of so much fear. First was Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s tragic death, then the mother gu entered Wanyan Lie\u2019s brain. Which one was not shocking and extremely frightening?</p><br/><p>After experiencing these things in one night, the young girl became silly. Especially when she remembered the appearance of that meaty worm when it entered Wanyan Lie\u2019s brain, the young girl couldn\u2019t help but vomit.</p><br/><p>The girl saying this made Qing Gu frown. Why did she encounter someone so similar to princess Ming Yue here? Who is this girl? Why is she here?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich palace\u2019s palace maid are you? Come, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d Qing Gu took the young girl\u2019s hand and let her stand in front of everyone. After seeing the appearance of the young girl, Li Bing and Lin Ke Xing were shocked. Is this not a copy of Wanyan Ming Yue? What is going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything\u2026They said to let me come here and be the imperial noble consort\u2026I don\u2019t know anything else\u2026\u201d The young girl looked at these eyes full of murderous aura. While crying, she shook her head.</p><br/><p>Imperial noble consort? The words of the young girl almost made them faint. Li Bing was about to open her mouth, when Jing De quickly came forward and pierced a dagger through the young girl\u2019s abdomen. \u201cEmperor, Jing De took revenge for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrab him!\u201d Li Bing quickly let people take Jing De down, but the young girl had already fallen onto the ground and wasn\u2019t breathing anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you kill her?!\u201d Not getting to know the answers she wanted, Li Bing was a bit angry. Jing De was neither servile nor overbearing, \u201cAnswering niangniang, it was her and imperial noble consort niangniang who attacked the emperor. That was why the emperor is still unconscious. Just now, this slave was too busy and didn\u2019t notice her. This slave didn\u2019t expect that she actually hid here. She\u2019s truly too daring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although there were many loopholes in Jing De\u2019s words, but the young girl had already been killed by him. The dead couldn\u2019t testify. Li Bing had no way to deal with Jing De.</p><br/><p>After all, Jing De served Wanyan Lie for so many years. He is the emperor\u2019s confidant. If she punishes Jing De for an equivocal suspicion, when Wanyan Lie wakes up, the first one to be unlucky would be her. So, although she had doubts, Li Bing still pushed these doubts down.</p><br/><p>The one who also had doubts was Qing Gu. It was just, she spent so many years in the palace and experienced many big winds and waves. Naturally, she wouldn\u2019t display these doubts. She bowed at the empress and consort De. Qing Gu left Long Autumn palace.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the news of Wanyan Lie being attacked by imperial noble consort to reach Nan Lin wangfu3. Nalan Xin stood outside of Tingsong building with the news. It was not good to enter, but it was also not good to retreat.</p><br/><p>Today is Feng Cang\u2019s big day. According to custom, a moment in spring is worth thousands. If he enters rashly and disturbed wangye\u2019s4 happiness, he would definitely be skinned by Feng Cang. However, the news of something happening to Wanyan Lie was too shocking, ah. If he didn\u2019t tell and delayed wangye\u2019s matter, then wouldn\u2019t it be bad?</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin walked back and forth outside of Tingsong building. He couldn\u2019t decide if he should enter or come back tomorrow. He walked back and forth and couldn\u2019t think what to do. Suddenly, he heard a chuckle. He turned and saw that it was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s maid Su Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs teacher Nalan looking for wangye?\u201d Because Nalan Xin had taught Murong Qi Qi lessons, so Su Yue and Su Mei also used teacher to call him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there\u2019s something. But I\u2019m afraid to disturb wangye\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin\u2019s explanation made Su Yue laugh harder, \u201cTeacher Nalan, what matter is bigger than wangye and wangfei\u2019s5 wedding night? Could it be that teacher doesn\u2019t know the importance of a wedding night to a woman? This is wangfei\u2019s only wedding night. If this was interrupted by teacher\u2026really don\u2019t know how shy wangfei would be. Or is it that teacher thinks your place in wangye\u2019s heart is more important than wangfei\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin understood immediately after Su Yue said that. Even though he followed Feng Cang for so many years, but how could he be compared to Murong Qi Qi! Murong Qi Qi is the baby of Feng Cang\u2019s heart and is the person Feng Cang cherishes the most. How could he compare to Murong Qi Qi?!</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher if you have something to tell, it\u2019s better to come look for wangye tomorrow! I\u2019m telling teacher, my miss is the one who kept grudges the most. If teacher angers my miss, then in the future, you will suffer. Presumably, teacher has never experienced the power of a pillow talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>When saying this, Su Yue smiled. The dimples on her cheeks showed faintly. Under the moonlight, she was in a green dress and looked like a fairy. For the first time, Nalan Xin discovered Su Yue was such a beautiful woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking miss Su Yue for waking me up!\u201d Nalan Xin bowed slightly at Su Yue making Su Yue a bit startled. She didn\u2019t say anything. She nodded, turned and left.</p><br/><p>Inside the building, Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi while telling her stories about his childhood. After hearing about Feng Xie\u2019s and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s love story, Murong Qi Qi was somewhat envious. A desire for familial love also emerged in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, if princess and great general were still alive, they would certainly be a heavenly couple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d Feng Cang bit Murong Qi Qi\u2019s fingertip, \u201cWhy are you still calling them princess and general, ah?! You should call them father and mother now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s word made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes got wet. That was right! No matter what the result is, Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue are her father and mother. If she\u2019s their daughter, then they\u2019re her biological father and mother. If she\u2019s their daughter-in-law, then they\u2019re also her father and mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Murong Qi Qi laughed, making Feng Cang almost lost his soul, \u201cQing Qing, why is it that you\u2019re becoming more and more beautiful in my eyes? So, beautiful, that I\u2019m getting drunk in your arms!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s sweet words were endless, making Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart also become very sweet. The two snuggled for a while. Then Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi. \u201cQing Qing, it\u2019s time we rest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These words coming from Feng Cang had a taste of shyness. Don\u2019t take that he\u2019s a big man and already twenty-five years old, but in that area, he was blank as paper. He wasn\u2019t much better than Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I\u2026\u201d The moment she heard the word \u2018rest\u2019, her body stiffened. Seeing Murong Qi Qi so nervous, Feng Cang\u2019s big hand gently patted Murong Qi Qi\u2019s back. \u201cQing Qing, didn\u2019t I say I won\u2019t force you?! I\u2019ll wait for you! I will wait till you\u2019re willing to accept me! Accept everything about me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was very moved with Feng Cang being so considerate and gentle. \u201cWangye, give me time! Give me some time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Holding Murong Qi Qi\u2019s somewhat cold hands, Feng Cang gave her a very flirtatious gaze. \u201cBeloved consort, benwang6 tossed and turned the whole day and is very tired. If we still don\u2019t go sleep, then tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get up and go to the palace to pay our gratitude\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s act of cuteness made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mood get a lot better. The two changed clothes and went to bed. Feng Cang turned off the lights. The whole room dimmed.</p><br/><p>This was the first time, the two shared a bed and pillow. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body was a bit stiff. Feng Cang was also not a lot better. The two were stiff for a long time. In the end, it was Feng Cang who chuckled and broke this stiffened atmosphere. \u201cQing Qing, is it alright if I hug you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Murong Qi Qi softly said that. The next moment, she fell into Feng Cang\u2019s wide embrace.</p><br/><p>Smelling the fragrance of green apples in his arms, Feng Cang was very satisfied! Just holding her like this, he felt like he got the whole world. His whole heart was filled with happiness. Feng Cang\u2019s arms were unexpectedly warm, making Murong Qi Qi be intoxicated in them.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was because she didn\u2019t res last night; perhaps it was because today she was very tired from the wedding or perhaps it was because Feng Cang\u2019s embrace was too indulging; Murong Qi Qi fell asleep very fast and was breathing steadily.</p><br/><p>Looking at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s slightly turned face, Feng Cang\u2019s heart ached. The wedding must\u2019ve tired her! This little woman, occasionally putting down her strong side would let people\u2019s heart ache so much for her.</p><br/><p>A kiss fell on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead again. Feng Cang let Murong Qi Qi stay in his embrace, \u201cGood night! My most beloved little baby!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was in a deep sleep, but Feng Cang didn\u2019t seem the slightest bit sleepy. It was already over zishi (11pm-1am). The thing that should happen didn\u2019t appear. What did this mean?</p><br/><p>In the past, every time when it didn\u2019t even reach haishi (9pm-11pm), his gu poison would act up. But now it\u2019s already zishi, nothing uncomfortable appeared from his body. Could it be because he had vomited the primer of the gu poison?</p><br/><p>The sleeping habits of the little person in his arms didn\u2019t seem very good. It didn\u2019t take a moment before Murong Qi Qi bullied Feng Cang like an octopus. Her whole body was dancing like a dough and pasted in his embrace.</p><br/><p>Could this little woman not know that he\u2019s a healthy man?! Feng Cang\u2019s thoughts transferred from the gu poison to Murong Qi Qi. This whole night, her apple fragrance stimulated Feng Cang\u2019s mind, making him more and more sober.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi \u2018mm-ed\u2019 once. Her small head rubbed Feng Cang\u2019s chest as if she wanted to get more of his warmth.</p><br/><p>Her movement didn\u2019t matter, but it woke up all those sleeping cells of Feng Cang\u2019s body. The beauty was in his arms. His whole body stirred and telling him to throw himself on Murong Qi Qi. Can\u2019t! Feng Cang bit his lips. He promised her to wait till she\u2019s willing and won\u2019t force her. How could he do the non-gentleman thing when she\u2019s asleep?!</p><br/><p>However, the woman he loves was in his arms. He obviously loves her very much and wanted to have her completely, but he couldn\u2019t help but play the role of a gentleman. It was like when a hungry person saw water and food, but wasn\u2019t permitted to eat. It was like having dysentery, but couldn\u2019t go to the toilet. Truly f****** torturing! So choking!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat, when would you completely open your heart to me, ah?!\u201d Feng Cang helplessly held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s slender jade-like fingers. He kissed them and smelled the fragrance of a woman from Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body. \u201cQing Qing, do you know that I\u2019m nearly going crazy from wanting you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>TLNote: A bit explanation about the gu. The gu is an insect that survive from eating human blood and flesh. When dormant, it won\u2019t do anything. However when woken up by the special sound of the whistle, it would listen to the whistle sounds and do as the whistler command it (will be in more detail in future chapters). In the story, Wanyan Lie took so many consorts who looked like Wanyan Ming Yue, one was because he needed to satisfy his desire; two, was because the gu needs a host. The moment it is used, without a host, it would die.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

First, the weather was too hot and second, because of the arrival at Dayu Mountain. The bandit Xi Mei from Dayu Mountain was very ferocious, so everyone couldn\u2019t be happy.</p><br/><p>After seeing the demeanor of everyone, Song Xi beckoned Ah Nan over, \u201cAh Nan, that brat Ah Wei went to scout the road, why hasn\u2019t he returned yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ah Nan was a newcomer who just came to the caravan. This time, just before departing, the boss elder Yu especially told Song Xi that Ah Nan was his (Lao Yu) distant relative\u2019s nephew and asked him (SX) to take special care of him on the road. Song Xi hated this kind of entering through the backdoor the most. He especially \u2018took care\u2019 of Ah Nan through the whole journey. The hard ones, the tired ones, he let Ah Nan do it all. If it wasn\u2019t because Ah Nan was a newbie, Song Xi would also make him do things such as scouting the road.</p><br/><p>However, Ah Nan was a good-tempered one and was good at his work. No matter what Song Xi made him do, he (Ah Nan) had done it carefully and properly. Song Xi couldn\u2019t find any mistakes.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this brat was lively. Where he went was where the joy was. Not long after he entered the caravan, he was able to blend in with the guys. In addition, on several occasions where they had encountered danger, Ah Nan took the lead and saved everyone. Therefore, in the caravan, Ah Nan\u2019s prestige was almost equal to Song Xi. It made Song Xi had a sense of crisis for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know? Aren\u2019t you two close enough to wear the same pants? You don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Song, I don\u2019t have that of a big waistband, and I\u2019m not a demigod.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Nan\u2019s words caused laughter in the surroundings. Even Song Xi who saw Ah Nan\u2019s serious expression afterwards, also laughed and scolded him, \u201cGet lost\u2026Don\u2019t stand in front of me, seeing you make me feel irritated.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ah Nan left, Song Xi rubbed the sweat on his face and stared at the misty green hills not far away, and muttered, \u201cCould it be that Ah Wei ran into the bandits?\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>Nan Feng had been steady and stable in Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s hands. It could be regarded as a strong and prosperous nation. However, in such a country, there was an exception like Dayu Mountain.</p><br/><p>Dayu Mountain was located in the north of Nan Feng, near the frontier fortress. Because the mountain was high and far away, the officials couldn\u2019t care much about it. Five years ago, Dayu Mountain was occupied by a group of bandits. In less than two years, the name of the female leader of Dayu Mountain Xi Mei spread out, and it was now even more resounding throughout Nan Feng.</p><br/><p>All caravans going out of the border must pass through Dayu Mountain. As long as they passed by, they must pay tribute to Xi Mei. Otherwise, they would be looted. In order to avoid being robbed, some caravans made a detour around Dayu Mountain. But after Xi Mei discovered it, she directly took people and outflanked them (caravans). In the end, they came to an even more tragic end and directly lost their lives.</p><br/><p>The imperial army had also come over to encircle and suppress them several times. But because Dayu Mountain was big and deep, the army failed to do something significant to the bandits. After a few times, the imperial army had lost a lot of troops and horses. It gradually became unbothered. As a result, the bandits of Dayu Mountain also became notorious all over the world. Those caravans saw that even the imperial court couldn\u2019t deal with Xi Mei. So they might as well pass through Dayu Mountain and honestly paid tribute to Xi Mei. This way, it was more peaceful.</p><br/><p>Song Xi was on this road for several decades. Since the appearance of the bandits, he had also paid tribute to Xi Mei according to the rules, and every time it was safe and sound. This time, Song Xi sent Ah Wei to scout the road, was to see where the bandits were so that he could be prepared. But didn\u2019t expect Ah Wei to be gone for half a day and still didn\u2019t return. It was really anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, are we going or are we still waiting?\u201d Someone asked. Song Xi clenched his teeth, looked at the sky, and ordered. \u201cLet\u2019s go ahead!\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>The caravans entered in big groups the Dayu Mountain and still didn\u2019t encounter bandits in the evening.</p><br/><p>There was something odd about it. Song Xi felt that going this \u2018smoothly\u2019 was wrong. Did the bandits got drunk and went to sleep? Those were actually devils who killed people without blinking their eyes. He heard that many wanted criminals had fled to Dayu Mountain to become bandits. These people couldn\u2019t be offended.</p><br/><p>Just as Song Xi was racking his brains about the abnormalities of the bandits, a \u2018rustling\u2019 sound came from the nearby forest. Then a \u2018hand over the money, don\u2019t kill\u2019 was heard, which scared Song Xi so much that he almost fell off the horse.</p><br/><p>After looking again, a pink figure slowly appeared in front of everyone. That woman\u2019s black hair was hanging down on her left shoulder, the hair wrapped in pearls, gold and silver threads. There was a quail-egg-sized gem that hung in her earlobe, lengthening her white earlobe.</p><br/><p>She was wearing a pink short dress with dark red knee pads on her legs, and a collar so low revealing the aqua-blue undergarment with the white flesh swaying with each step, letting people daydream.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, boss Song, I haven\u2019t seen you for a few days, but you have already forgotten the rules of Dayu Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that the woman in front of them was the bandit Xi Mei that gave many a headache. Seeing that somebody came over, Song Xi quickly filled his face with a smile, \u201cMiss Xi, you misunderstood! This time, I have sent Ah Wei over as soon as I arrived at the mountain. But after waiting for a long time, Ah Wei didn\u2019t come back\u2026And I\u2019m in a hurry, so that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any Ah Wei or Ah Mao that you mentioned. Brothers, have you all seen them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNO\u2026.\u201d The men at the side waved their swords and shouted fiercely. It scared the people of the caravans so much that they dismounted their horses, and lowered their heads for fear of annoying the bandits and make them taking their lives.</p><br/><p>Compared with these people, Ah Nan who was still on the horse, stood out particularly. Xi Mei soon noticed him.</p><br/><p>Ah Nan was sitting upright on the horse and was holding the reins with a straight back. He looked at Xi Mei without squinting. There wasn\u2019t the slightest timidity in his eyes, which aroused Xi Mei\u2019s interest.</p><br/><p>Xi Mei swayed the colorful horsewhip in her hand, swinging her hips and walked to the horse. She raised her pretty face and looked at Ah Nan.</p><br/><p>This face of the oval type didn\u2019t have the fairness of women in the boudoir. Instead, because of the long-term exposure to the sun, it was dyed with a healthy red. On the oval face, there was a flamboyant pair of long, shapely eyebrows with thick dark colors. Under the eyebrows, there was an indescribable charm in the eyes. On the left face of Xi Mei, there was a thin scar that continued from the tip of the eyebrow to the corner of the lip.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xi Mei was looking at Ah Nan with strong interest. In the eyes of Xi Mei, Ah Nan was a tall man with wide shoulders, a thin waist, narrow hips and a superb body. Compared with the good figure, Ah Nan\u2019s face was rather ordinary. Not handsome, but charming, and very young, at most sixteen or seventeen years old.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brother, first time going out?\u201d Xi Mei jumped up and sat down in Ah Nan\u2019s arms. Her hands reached into Ah Nan\u2019s clothes and squeezed a few times. Hard muscles, great body! Xi Mei burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Miss Xi, please take good care of me.\u201d Ah Nan with a straight face gripped the hand of Xi Mei to not let her go any deeper.</p><br/><p>Ah Nan\u2019s voice had a special kind of magnetism. Listening to it, made Xi Mei\u2019s heart tremble. She wasn\u2019t a little girl who had no experience. But Ah Nan\u2019s clean body air made her feel good and happy. After looking into the eyes of Ah Nan, this feeling in Xi Mei\u2019s heart was more obvious. This man was full of magic, people couldn\u2019t help but want to explore.</p><br/><p>Xi Mei moved sideways to expose the white flesh on her chest to Ah Nan. She put her hands around his neck and rubbed gently her chest against Ah Nan\u2019s strong chest. \u201cHow old are you, brother? Is there a wife in the family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d Ah Nan shook his head and leaned backwards, trying to create more distance between Xi Mei and him.</p><br/><p>After Song Xi, who was in front of the team, heard Xi Mei\u2019s questions, his forehead was covered in cold sweat. What did this woman want to do? Could it be that she took a fancy to Ah Nan and wanted to make Ah Nan her bandit den\u2019s husband? The slutiness of Xi Mei was as notorious as her ruthless and spicy attitude. A man with a bit of good-looks would be kept by her. Although Ah Nan wasn\u2019t outstanding in appearance, he had entered the eyes of Xi Mei, which was a troublesome matter. If Xi Mei really wanted to keep Ah Nan, how was he going to explain to the boss (elder Yu)?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have a wife?\u201d Xi Mei hooked her hands and stroked Ah Nan\u2019s chin. The black stubble was still soft, proving that this man wasn\u2019t mature and still unripe.</p><br/><p>Xi Mei stared at Ah Nan\u2019s eyes. She looked at the shadow inside, and her voice softened up. \u201cThen do you have someone to marry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>Ah Nan\u2019s answer made Xi Mei very happy. She laughed heartily and showed two rows of white teeth and pink gum flesh. Just when everyone thought that Xi Mei was going to snatch him directly, Xi Mei got down and came to Song Xi. The horsewhip hooked around Song Xi\u2019s neck and brought him into her arms. \u201cSong Xi, you broke my rules today. As a rule, you have to leave all the goods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Xi didn\u2019t dare to look at that spring bosom and quickly dodged to the side to make a bow with his hands to Xi Mei. \u201cMiss Xi, I really sent Ah Wei out. That brat must be hiding somewhere playing. If the goods are confiscated, even ten heads of mine won\u2019t be enough to compensate! Miss Xi, be generous. We can pay more for the toll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Song Xi like this, Xi Mei smiled and didn\u2019t answer. Her eyes looked straight at Ah Nan. As it happened, Ah Nan was also looking at her. Xi Mei felt that there was a fire burning inside, making her fidget. She whipped her whip and pointed to Ah Nan, and said to Song Xi, \u201cThe toll is tenfold and he has to stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the first part of the sentence, Song Xi was relieved. Tenfold, then tenfold was fine. As long as the goods weren\u2019t confiscated. However, why was the latter sentence so wrong!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing by keeping Ah Nan? He\u2019s clumsy, he can\u2019t do anything well, and he\u2019s still a novice. Do you want to change to somebody else\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I just fancy him! This lady just like beautiful young boys!\u201d</p><br/><p>The stubbornness of Xi Mei was well known. The things she had set on wouldn\u2019t be changed. But leaving Ah Nan, Song Xi couldn\u2019t do it. Although he didn\u2019t like this young man who entered the caravan through the backdoor, Ah Nan wasn\u2019t bad. For the success of the caravan, he needed to leave Ah Nan in the bandit\u2019s nest. But in the event if something happened to Ah Nan, not only it wasn\u2019t easy to tell the boss (elder Yu), Song Xi himself would also feel very apologetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Xi, we can pay more for the toll, but Ah Nan really can\u2019t stay. I promised the boss to protect him. This is hard to comply.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, then there\u2019s nothing to say!\u201d Xi Mei laughed and clapped. The bandits flocked over and surrounded the caravan. \u201cSince boss Song refused, I can only let you all stay! Brothers, take them all to the Chao Tian village!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, the bandits came forward and shoved the crowds. They (bandits) bound their (caravan) hands one by one with hemp rope, and their eyes were wrapped in black cloth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Special Chapter: The last princess (1) (Part 2)</p><br/><p>Chao Tian village was located in the deep mountains of Dayu Mountain. Song Xi and the others were blindfolded by a black cloth. When they were taken to the village, the sky was already dark.</p><br/><p>When they saw the light, the crowds found out that Chao Tian village was actually a dam in the mountain, with only a narrow path out. The dam was surrounded by cliffs. It was a smart move to choose such a place for a village.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like it here?\u201d Xi Mei came up to Ah Nan and stood beside him. She then found out that her height was barely at Ah Nan\u2019s chest. The more she looked at him, the more satisfied she was, the more she liked him. She decided that Ah Nan was her man. She simply leaned in his arms and felt the masculinity of his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Nan didn\u2019t push Xi Mei away this time but looked closely at Chao Tian village. It was easy to defend but difficult to attack. It was no wonder that the imperial court hadn\u2019t found the bandit\u2019s nest for so long. So, it turned out they were hiding here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI picked this place! People of the imperial court can\u2019t find it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Mei leaned on the wooden fence and looked at her Chao Tian village. Her eyes were full of confidence.</p><br/><p>Ah Nan turned his face to the side and looked at Xi Mei. This woman was in her twenties, less than thirty. Usually, she looked just like a gorgeous beauty, somewhat vulgar, somewhat sexy, like the owner of a bar, both flattering and flirtatious. If it wasn\u2019t because the reputation of Chao Tian village was too well-known, and there was too much blood on her hands, no one would believe that the woman in front of him would be the bandit\u2019s leader who coldly killed people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you become a bandit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you discriminate against bandits?\u201d Xi Mei frowned and her two red lips moved close to Ah Nan. \u201cMy father was a bandit, my mother was a bandit, and my dead man was a bandit, so I\u2019m naturally a bandit too!\u201d</p><br/><p>This answer made Ah Nan smiled faintly. When he smiled, the corner of his mouth was very beautiful. Xi Mei\u2019s heart trembled and turned her eyes to one side. She had seen men more handsome than Ah Nan. Why did she think that Ah Nan was different? The smile was so charming. This Ah Nan was really good-looking!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Nan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Nan? Good name\u2026 Xi Mei suddenly tiptoed, trying to give Ah Nan a peck on the lips, but was avoided by him. Her lips just rubbed the stubble on his chin. \u201cAh Nan, I like you! If you don\u2019t want anything to happen to them, stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I say no?\u201d Ah Nan smiled wickedly. That smile made Xi Mei almost be indulged in it.</p><br/><p>If other people were provocative, Xi Mei would immediately kill that person without saying anything but Ah Nan was different. At first glance, Xi Mei took a fancy to Ah Nan. So that was why she took him to Chao Tian village.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Nan, you should have heard of my reputation. If you don\u2019t agree, I\u2019ll kill them one by one and let them die in front of you.\u201d Xi Mei smilingly spoke, but her eyes looked like it had a knife. She was determined to have this man. The men she had fancied, there wasn\u2019t one who she couldn\u2019t obtain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I heard that anyone who has been taken to Chao Tian village, end up with dead eventually. You\u2019re afraid that people will leak the location of Chao Tian village and therefore will kill them every time. This is your usual trick. Since they are doomed to die in the end, why should I care so much?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Nan\u2019s answer was somewhat inhuman, but the more Xi Mei listened, the more she liked this man.</p><br/><p>Everyone said that she Xi Mei\u2019s methods were cruel. Not only robbing the money but also robbing people of their lives. However, she never cared about these claims. She liked this kind of life. Who in this village didn\u2019t have a few lives in their hands? She killed the most! In this line of work, she had long forgotten the virtues and moralities. She was just going to live in the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Nan, you can\u2019t run away! You\u2019re mine, just mine.\u201d Xi Mei\u2019s hand pulled out the hairpin on Ah Nan\u2019s head and put her hands in his thick black hair. \u201cTonight, you can\u2019t avoid the consummation! Looking at your appearance, you\u2019re still a virgin. You can rest assured. I\u2019ll teach you step by step!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Xi Mei laughed loudly and swung into the room.</p><hr/><br/><p>This time, except for Ah Nan, everyone else was tied up and thrown into the hut. The bandits in the village were drinking heavily and eating large pieces of meat. Those wooden houses were covered with white skeleton head on the roof, as if they were advertising their glorious achievements.</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband Ah Nan, come on\u2026\u201d Xi Mei changed to a thin layered red-burning gauze dress, with only embroidered \u2018mandarin ducks playing in the water\u2019 on the red undergarment and a red shorts inside. The white flesh was particularly enchanting under the red dress. The bandits on the field cheered and immediately filthy words were filled in Ah Nan\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband, are you shy? Would you like me to come to you?\u201d Xi Mei had put on makeup, and it looked very sexy under the lights.</p><br/><p>Ah Nan ignored Xi Mei. Instead, he pulled the rabbit meat in front of him and stuffed it into his mouth, and chewed it up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, the husband is perhaps shy! Look at him, he\u2019s certainly a small chicken. Leader, you must remember to be gentle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Husband, you must eat enough, then you\u2019ll have the energy to work hard! It\u2019s been a long time since the leader has cared about someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s words made Xi Mei very happy. She simply sat beside Ah Nan and served him the food. Seeing Xi Mei like this, the bandits whistled and roared one after another. They all said that Ah Nan was blessed enough to enjoy Xi Mei\u2019s close service.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d Xi Mei looked at those people and put her hands on Ah Nan\u2019s arms. \u201cYou all must have a good drink and good meal today! Right, don\u2019t come to disturb the bridal chamber! I want to be happy today!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Xi Mei went into Ah Nan\u2019s arms. \u201cHusband, are you done with eating? If you\u2019re full, let\u2019s go do something meaningful~~~.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Nan, who was avoiding before, lifted her up and put her on his shoulder. And in the whistling sound of everyone, they went to their bridal chamber.</p><hr/><br/><p>If Xi Mei had foresight, she would definitely let go of Ah Nan and the caravan. However, she wasn\u2019t a god and couldn\u2019t do fortune-telling. She didn\u2019t know that her life would come to an abrupt end on this day.</p><br/><p>When seventy-six people lively heads fell in front of Xi Mei, she screamed. No matter what, she couldn\u2019t connect the former ordinary Ah Nan with the crown prince of Nan Feng, Feng Xiao, in front of her.</p><br/><p>Looking at the red figure in front of her, handsome and with an unusual purple-eyed man, Xi Mei knew that she was wrong. She couldn\u2019t imagine that the magnificent crown prince would disguise as a servant in order to clean up the Dayu Mountain\u2019s bandits. When she entered the bridal chamber and was knocked unconscious by him, Xi Mei noticed something unusual. But this oddness happened so suddenly that she was caught off guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, kill me! Just kill me!\u201d Xi Mei looked up and looked at Ah Nan fiercely, no, it should be Feng Xiao. \u201cJust kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, the next one is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao clapped his hands and a person came forward to read the crime of Xi Mei. Until only now did Xi Mei knew that she had 143 lives on her hands. She couldn\u2019t remember it herself but didn\u2019t expect that Feng Xiao could find out.</p><br/><p>\u201cExecute\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Just as the big knife was about to fall, Xi Mei shouted out. \u201cHis Royal Highness, I, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mute girl who cooked for us is innocent. Her parents were killed by me. I saw that she was young and there wasn\u2019t any threat, so I let her stay as a servant. She\u2019s clean and innocent. Please be generous and don\u2019t kill her. She, she\u2019s only nine years old, still a child\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Execute her\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The head of Xi Mei fell down and rolled to the ground. Before dying, Xi Mei had been staring at the small figure not far away. There were too many unwillingness and intolerances in her eyes. Rong Hua, aunt could only help you till here. How your future would unfold, it would depend on your own fortunes\u2026</p><hr/><br/><p>~~~Rong Hua~~~</p><br/><p>When that heaven-like man came over, my cold heart suddenly jumped up. He came up to me and lowered his body. I found out that he had a pair of deep purple eyes, which was different from ordinary people. Beautiful and flirtatious, emitting an enchanting radiance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d His voice was very soft and low, with an enchanting luxury. I clenched my fist and looked at his eyes with some fear. I don\u2019t know what kind of existence I would be in Feng Xiao\u2019s eyes. At least my petite body, and wide and fully patched rough cloth would make him pity me from the heart. Moreover, I\u2019m a mute.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you write?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao opened his palms and put it in front of me. His fingers were slender. I thought that such a noble person as him must be very spoiled. But didn\u2019t expect that there was rough callus on his palms and fingers. It seemed that the rumored imperial crown prince who was a master of pen and sword, wasn\u2019t fake. Otherwise, Feng Xiao wasn\u2019t able to sneak into the Chao Tian village alone and eliminated the bandits that plagued the people in one go.</p><br/><p>\u201cRong Hua.\u201d</p><br/><p>I extended my fingers and wrote these two words in the palm of Feng Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cRong Hua? Good name!\u201d Feng Xiao rubbed my head. Just when I thought he would hand me over to the soldiers behind him, he picked me up. He looked young and not very sturdy. However, he was very tall and was strong enough.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that I was held like this. I was a little nervous. My small hands tightly grabbed the clothes on his chest. The firewood ash that was on my hands left a small handprint on his red burning brocade. I was so shocked that I pulled back my hands.</p><br/><p>Although this was Chao Tian village, news from the outside wasn\u2019t blocked. Aunt Xi Mei would bring back all kinds of news from the outside, such as news about Feng Xiao. I knew that he had germophobia (obsession with cleanliness) and liked red. The clothes on him must be the brocade with golden carp. I heard that once a palace maid went near him and wanted to get the favor of the crown prince, but she was thrown into the fish pond.</p><br/><p>Now, looking at the grey handprint on his brocade, I closed my eyes and my small body shivered. I don\u2019t know if my fate would also be thrown out by him like that palace maid. But with my frail body, I would be seriously injured if not dead landing on the ground.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a long time, when I felt hopeless in my heart, I heard a chuckle in my ear. \u201cHa, this little fellow is very interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t mad? I was very surprised and looked at Feng Xiao with wide eyes. His smile was very charming. Although I was only a nine years old child, I couldn\u2019t help but blush. Devilish beauty! It was probably to describe such a man like him!</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao held me and went out all the way. I saw the head of aunt Xi Mei. The look before her death was filled with all kinds of complicated feelings. I knew that she was worried about me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look! Children mustn\u2019t look at these things\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when I was about to say farewell to aunt Xi Mei, a fragrant handkerchief covered my head and blocked my view. The handkerchief smelled very good. I had never smelled such a smell. It actually had the same scent as Feng Xiao.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao didn\u2019t let me see, so I just rested on the shoulders of him. Children always made people put their defenses down. This was what aunt Xi Mei often said.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao obviously regarded me as an ordinary child. What he didn\u2019t know was that I grew up with aunt Xi Mei, so I was used to seeing all kinds of blood. The scene just now didn\u2019t frighten me at all. As early as the day when Chao Tian village was established, I knew that there would be a day like this. Aunt Xi Mei also knew. In other words, for the past five years, we had been waiting for this day, waiting for Feng Xiao to come.</p><br/><p>I held on Feng Xiao\u2019s shoulder and watched Chao Tian village where I grew up these years. I got far and farther away. My mood became heavier too.</p><br/><p>Aunt Xi Mei was dead. My only relative was gone, and my future looked dim. I don\u2019t know how I could stay with Feng Xiao and how I could survive.</p><br/><p>Aunt Xi Mei had said, \u201cRong Hua, no matter what happens, you must hold on to it. Even if you drift and lives without purpose, you must live on. Because your body is filled with noble blood. You won\u2019t be petty and low forever. You must not only live but also live a splendid life\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking of aunt Xi Mei and Chao Tian village, I slowly fell asleep. When I woke up again, I was lying on a clean bed. This room was far better, cleaner and more beautiful than my cottage in Chao Tian village. The curtains hanging on the side of the bed were translucent, embroidered with fluttery butterflies on it. Even the wings of the butterflies were decorated with beautiful little gems.</p><br/><p>The things from Jue Se Fang were really exquisite. I couldn\u2019t help but reach out and touch the butterflies on the curtains.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Rong Hua, you\u2019re awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the movement on the bed, a pretty girl appeared in front of me. She wasn\u2019t much older than me. About thirteen year\u2019s old and looked very friendly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis servant Dong Rui is sent by His Royal Highness to serve you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong Rui was the second person I got to know after leaving Chao Tian village. She smiled every day as if she never knew sorrow. In Dong Rui\u2019s words, I was too depressed. She thought it was because I had been in the Chao Tian village for a long time and was frightened by the bandits, so that\u2019s why I had lost my childishness and innocence. But how could Dong Rui know, I was also a bandit.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao placed me in the Hua Yang Hall of the Eastern Palace. Here, it faced the sun and was warm. Feng Xiao said that I\u2019m too thin compared to children of the same age and should be nourished well. Moreover, basking in the sun was one of the tasks that Feng Xiao arranged for me. He said to supplement me with calcium. I don\u2019t know what calcium supplement was, but I followed the request of Feng Xiao. First, it was to please him, this was the request of aunt Xi Mei to me; second, his words were reasonable.</p><br/><p>I liked the warm sunshine and I also liked the freshness and cleaness on Feng Xiao. It was just that I remembered the words of aunt Xi Mei: the hatred of destroying the country, made us unable to live under the same sky. Feng Xiao, he was destined to be my enemy in this life.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

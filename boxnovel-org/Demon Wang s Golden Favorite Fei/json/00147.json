Could it be to come catch us in the act?!\u201d After hearing Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi immediately sat up excitedly. \u201cIs he already on the way? What do we need to do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t notice that after Feng Cang saw this little woman being so excited about \u2018caught in the act\u2019, he reached out and pulled her into his arms, \u201cWhat to do? Of course, it\u2019s to do some things that would let people misunderstand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026I am talking about serious things with you!\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face got hot. She reached out and grabbed Feng Cang\u2019s restless big hand. \u201cHow do you plan to deal with Xia Yun Xi?! Seeing her appearance, she seemed to be set on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Qing Qing believe in me?\u201d Feng Cang turned over and held Murong Qi Qi under his body\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNot that I don\u2019t believe you\u2026I\u2019m only worried that woman would use underhanded means\u2026Mm, don\u2019t\u2026I\u2019m talking with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already let Ji Xiang watch over her. Nothing will happen!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s lips fell on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s earlobe. \u201cXia Yun Xi\u2019s emperor father and my mother are half-brother and sister (same father, different mothers). Her grandmother is my grandmother\u2019s junior sister. The one who poisoned my mother is her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother of Feng Cang were emperor and empress of Dong Lu. Feng Cang\u2019s maternal grandmother was a disciple of Peng Lai Island. Then, the maternal grandfather took maternal grandmother\u2019s junior sister. Maternal grandmother died, leaving FC\u2019s mother. The junior sister poisoned FC\u2019s mother with the fetal poison and gave birth to the current DL\u2019s emperor Xia Jin. </p><br/><p>\u201cSo, she should call you cousin brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, to be exact, we\u2019re enemies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we catch her and use her to exchange the fetal poison in your body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t concentrate, I\u2019ll punish you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in black squatted outside Long Autumn palace and stared at the situation inside until morning. When the sky didn\u2019t turn bright yet, he heard a \u201csqueak\u201d sound. The door opened. Feng Cang came out of the chamber in full spirits. Before he left, he gently closed the door as if he was afraid to disturb Murong Qi Qi\u2019s sweet dreams.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, there\u2019s adultery! The person in black lamented very much in his heart. There\u2019s too many horror things during these times! Big brother stayed in the little sister\u2019s room. If this thing gets out, it would be an explosive news, ah!</p><br/><p>The person in black reported Feng Cang\u2019s situation to Wanyan Lie. Hearing this news, Wanyan Lie was in a great mood. If Feng Cang didn\u2019t bother with the proper human relationship and really got together with Murong Qi Qi, then when will their child be born? Maybe, this child already existed now!</p><br/><p>Thinking about the child, Wanyan Lie inexplicably got excited. If there\u2019s a child, what should he gift this child? At least, the child\u2019s parents were brave. They did the thing he wanted to do in the past, but didn\u2019t dare to do it.</p><br/><p>The person in black could feel the joy from the body of the man wearing a dragon robe in front of him. Although he didn\u2019t know where this joy came from, but the person in black kept his kneeling position, and didn\u2019t dare to have the slightest neglect.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, it\u2019s time for the morning court meeting!\u201d Jing De came to Wanyan Lie\u2019s side, dragging him from his feverish fantasy back to the reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Wanyan Lie tidied up his clothes. Before he left, he repeatedly reminded the person in black, \u201cContinue keep watch. Report their interactions at any time to zhen.\u201d1</p><br/><p>During the morning court, the officials discovered that the emperor\u2019s mood was very good today. From beginning to end, Wanyan Lie kept a touch of smile. Besides, his mind wandered several times. He needed Jing De to remind him before he got his mind back.</p><br/><p>After the morning court, the officials gathered in groups of three and four. They wanted to know what good things had happened for such an abnormal behavior to appear in the always calm and collected Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>Some people guessed that the emperor got a new favorite concubine and filled the vacancy Yue Lan Zhi left. Some people said it was because the treasury was full, which made the emperor happy. There were also people who said that Nan Lin wang2 and Dong Lu\u2019s princess Xia Yu Xi\u2019s good matter was approaching. The emperor could get the fishery through a marriage alliance. That was why he was happy\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, all kinds of rumors merged together and spread to Wanyan Yi. After hearing everyone\u2019s assumptions about Feng Cang and Xia Yun Xi, Wanyan Yi couldn\u2019t help but clench his fists. If emperor father really thought like this, then what should he do?</p><br/><p>Inside Nan Lin wangfu,3 from the moment Xia Yun Xi had woken up early in the morning, she had been boiling chicken soup. The small fire burned slowly. When Feng Cang came back from the morning court; he would be able to drink a delicious chicken soup. While Xia Yun Xi fanned next to the small stove, she reveled in her own virtuousness.</p><br/><p>Before, at White Cloud Restaurant, Murong Qi Qi said that Feng Cang liked virtuous women the most. Like her, not only was she virtuous, she also had a strong background, identity and such a rich dowry. Even if Feng Cang lit up the lanterns, he wouldn\u2019t be able to find another! Who wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her?!</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, wangye has returned!\u201d Hong Ye trotted back and panted. The moment she reached Guanyu building, she reported to Xia Yun Xi the news she\u2019d acquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Xia Yun Xi was so happy, she almost knocked over the chicken soup. Feng Cang had returned. This was the time for her to show a good performance!</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi let people bring the chicken soup out with a ladle and let a small palace maid hold it. After that, she was escorted by Hong Ye to Tingsong building</p><br/><p>Only after personally going this time, did Xia Yun Xi discover that Guanyu building and Tingsong building were so far from each other. Although the winter was over and the spring had just began, but she was used to using a sedan for travel. When had she ever walked so far?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop\u2026rest for a while. I can\u2019t walk anymore!\u201d Xia Yun Xi sat on a stone bench. Her hands rubbed her legs. Why is Nan Lin wangfu so big, ah?! Till when does she have to walk before she could see Feng Cang, ah?!</p><br/><p>Hong Ye squatted to massage Xia Yun Xi\u2019s legs. All the way, Xia Yun Xi had been resting. The originally one-hour route was now more than two hours walk for her. Now, there\u2019s still a great distance between this area and Tingsong building. According to Xia Yun Xi\u2019s way of walking, they may not even reach it tonight.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, if you continue to rest, when the chicken soup reaches wangye, it would be cold!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Ye carefully reminded at a side. Hearing her mention the chicken soup, Xia Yun Xi immediately stood up. \u201cRight, right, right, how could I forget that?! If the chicken soup gets cold, it won\u2019t be tasty! Feng Cang\u2019s body is not good, naturally he can\u2019t eat cold things! Hong Ye, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s quickly go!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xia Yun Xi arrived at Tingsong building, her pair of legs were almost ruined. From young till now, Xia Yun Xi had never walked such a long way. This time, she broke this rule for Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Originally, Xia Yun Xi wanted to enter the place directly, but she was blocked by Ruyi. Knowing that it wouldn\u2019t be easy to see Feng Cang, Xia Yun Xi quickly adopted a gentle policy, \u201cThis little brother, bothering you to go inside and inform wangye; say that Dong Lu\u2019s princess Yun is seeking a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye is dealing with the government affairs. He doesn\u2019t allow anyone to disturb him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, bengong4 has come a very long way to let wangye drink the soup bengong has personally boiled. This little brother, help a bit out and give a bit of convenience!\u201d Xia Yun Xi gave Hong Ye a glance. Hong Ye immediately took out a silver ingot worth ten liang, and gave it to Ruyi.</p><br/><p>Ruyi didn\u2019t reject and generously received the money. Originally, Xia Yun Xi thought that after getting the money, Ruyi would make way. She didn\u2019t expect that he would still block the way in front of her and didn\u2019t let her go in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye said that he doesn\u2019t want to see anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Seeing Ruyi receive an advantage and not give a convenience, made Xia Yun Xi\u2019s face turn red. \u201cBengong is princess Yun. It\u2019s your majesty who let me move into Nan Lin wangfu! You\u2019re only a slave. Blocking bengong here, what kind of ability is that?! Get out of the way, bengong wants to see Feng Cang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019m a slave, but I\u2019m wangye\u2019s slave and only listen to wangye\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyi\u2019s puffed face made Xia Yun Xi very angry. \u201cBengong boiled the chicken soup that wangye loves the most. You use all sort of excuses to not let bengong see wangye. Later, when the chicken soup gets cold, would you be able to bear responsibility?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xia Yun Xi say that made Ruyi laugh just once.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said our wangye loves chicken soup the most? If our wangye touched chicken meat, his whole body would get an allergy. In this life, he hates chicken the most, not to mention chicken soup. In this wangfu, there isn\u2019t even one living chicken! Princess, where did you hear this? Haha, fortunately I blocked you. If you went inside, the moment wangye sees that it\u2019s chicken soup, he would certainly turn the table over and think that you wanted to harm him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyi\u2019s half true and half false words stopped Xia Yun Xi, \u201cWhat? Wangye can\u2019t eat chicken?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you! If I let you in, and because of this soup, wangye gets annoyed, I would also be punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ruyi said this, Xia Yun Xi began to somewhat believe it. It was clear that someone wanted to sabotage her!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Xia Yun Xi turned her head and glared at Hong Ye. Hong Ye was startled and immediately knelt in front of her, \u201cPrincess, this slave really heard it from this wangfu\u2019s people. Even if this slave has a very big gut, but this slave wouldn\u2019t dare to fool princess, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not you?\u201d If you said that Xia Yun Xi\u2019s heart was a calm water, then Ruyi\u2019s words were like a small stone. Throwing it and with a \u2018splash\u2019, a circle of ripples would appear.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, this slave, like princess had just entered wangfu not long ago. How would this slave know that wangye is allergic to chicken?! This slave followed you for so many years, presumably princess knows more than anyone what kind of person this slave is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Hong Ye had followed Xia Yun Xi since little and was her confidante, but after meeting with Feng Cang\u2019s matter, Xia Yun Xi would still lose her reasoning. Immediately, two slaps went to Hong Ye\u2019s delicate face, \u201cLowly slave! You set up bengong! Fortunately, this little brother told bengong the truth, otherwise, wouldn\u2019t bengong have harmed wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis slave is innocent, ah! Princess, this slave is innocent!\u201d Hong Ye wore two red handprints, her mouth kept shouting \u2018innocent\u2019 and her head knocked heavily on the ground. It so happened that this place had a stone road. Hong Ye only knocked three or four times, which made her head already swell up like a purple bag.</p><br/><p>Hong Ye kept shouting \u2018innocent\u2019. Her intonation was tearful. Xia Yun Xi wasn\u2019t moved because of this. Her eyes stared at Tingsong building. She wanted to make trouble to cause Feng Cang to come out.</p><br/><p>It was just, Xia Yun xi calculated wrong. Feng Cang knew that she was about to come, so he had long left wangfu. Now, it was only Xia Yun Xi standing foolishly outside Tingsong building.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a long time, not a sound came out of the building. Xia Yun Xi got anxious. She had sacrificed Hong Ye for Feng Cang. Hong Ye\u2019s head was already broken because of the knocks. Could this still not move Feng Cang? He refused to come out and take one glance at her?</p><br/><p>Although it had been some time since she\u2019d arrived at Bei Zhou, but Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t even get to see Feng Cang\u2019s face. So, she\u2019d boiled chicken soup and brought it over. She didn\u2019t think that this message was wangfu\u2019s slaves fooling her.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi knew that Hong Ye was not to blame. However, to see Feng Cang once, she couldn\u2019t not use the trick of injuring oneself to gain the enemy\u2019s confidence. Xia Yun Xi wanted to let Feng Cang know through punishing Hong Ye, that as long as the matter was related to him, she would fully protect him and she hoped to move Feng Cang\u2019s heart. However, it seemed that Feng Cang doesn\u2019t allow himself to be pushed around.</p><br/><p>The pair of master and servant in front of him couldn\u2019t help but make Ruyi feel sick. He had never seen such a master. When meeting with things, she would let the slave block it! Seeing that Xia Yun Xi got impatient from waiting and wanted to rush inside, Ruyi pulled out his sword without a trace of politeness and stopped in front of Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous!\u201d Seeing Ruyi use his weapon, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s expression turned dark, \u201cDo you know who bengong is? You actually dared to use force on bengong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a princess, but my master is wangye! Wangye said to not allow anyone to put one step inside Tingsong building; otherwise, kill without pardon! Princess, don\u2019t force me!\u201d</p><br/><p>From Xia Yun Xi\u2019s point of view, Ruyi was just a slave. He was so humble, he couldn\u2019t even be compared to ants. Now, he was the fox exploiting the tiger\u2019s might. He kept saying that it was Feng Cang\u2019s meaning and blocked her outside of Tingsong building. This was obviously stopping her and not wanting her to see Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>The fox exploiting the tiger\u2019s might: use powerful connections to intimidate people</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of the way! Bengong wants to see wangye!\u201d Xia Yun Xi wasn\u2019t scared. Since she wasn\u2019t afraid of Ruyi, she wanted to force her way in. The next moment, a cool air appeared on her neck. It turned out that Ruyi\u2019s sword was already on her neck. Just a bit closer would\u2019ve cut her beautiful throat and let her become a corpse.</p><br/><p>The small palace maid who\u2019d carried the chicken soup, the moment she saw this situation, she was so scared that her hand drooped. The food tray in her hand fell on the ground. The chicken soup spilled and sprinkled all over the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t get angry!\u201d Hong Ye found that the momentum wasn\u2019t right. She quickly stood up and pulled Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, here is Bei Zhou. Everyone knows that Nan Lin wang is temperamental. If you offend him, maybe\u2026,\u201d Hong Ye didn\u2019t finish her sentence, but she told Xia Yun Xi the truth. This is Feng Cang\u2019s territory. You, ah, should act a bit more leisurely. After all, there were so many rumors about Feng Cang. Even if he really killed Xia Yun Xi, at this time, no one would come save her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Xia Yun Xi stomped and glared ferociously at Ruyi, \u201cYou wait! When bengong becomes Nan Lin wangfei,5 bengong will let you see (suffer)!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyi\u2019s obstruction made Xia Yun Xi even more determined to see Feng Cang and become his woman. He\u2019s just a small guard and dared to be so arrogant. She must become Feng Cang\u2019s woman. By then, she\u2019ll let Ruyi suffer and avenge for today\u2019s humiliation!</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi left angrily. As she was leaving, she moved too quickly and stepped on her skirt. Like eating dog\u2019s poop, she fell on the ground, making Ruyi laugh out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess!\u201d Hong Ye and the small palace maid quickly stepped forward to support Xia Yun Xi. They didn\u2019t expect that the moment she got up, the first thing she did was give each one of them a slap in the face. Then, she turned her head and glared once at Ruyi.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi had never received such humiliation. The one who gave her grimaces of displeasure was just a slave. How could the anger be eliminated from Xia Yun Xi\u2019s heart?</p><br/><p>After returning to Guanyu building, Xia Yun Xi was already tired half to death. Plus the fact that she was humiliated, made her angry and annoyed. Her charming face was very red.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong Ye, when will eldest senior brother and third senior brother arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, sir Misha and sir Jia Lan must be on the way. Sir Misha is unable to move freely. Presumably, they will be delayed for some days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Xia Yun Xi threw the porcelain cup onto the ground. \u201cWhen eldest senior brother and third senior brother arrive, I will let them see! Feng Cang is mine. No one can stop my determination to become Nan Lin wangfei! This man is mine. I will definitely not give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of how ugly Xia Yun Xi cursed, Feng Cang couldn\u2019t even hear it. At this time, he was at Long Autumn palace, keeping Murong Qi Qi company.</p><br/><p>Ever since Feng Xie disguised himself and entered Long Autumn palace with Murong Qi Qi, he spent all his time accompanying Wanyan Ming Yue. Feng Xie wanted to make up for the many days and nights he had been separated from Wanyan Ming Yue. He also hoped that Wanyan Ming Yue would wake up quickly from the deep sleep and let their family be reunited.</p><br/><p>Feng Xie was like this, and Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi also thought like that. The two also freed as much time as possible to take turns and keep Wanyan Ming Yue company.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi and Jin Mo also prepared a herbal tea created specficially for Wanyan Ming Yue. Plus, Feng Xie personally fed liquid food to Wanyan Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang coming to Long Autumn palace; firstly, was to accompany Murong Qi Qi. Secondly, was because he didn\u2019t want to see Xia Yun Xi. Now, Xia Yun had taken the imperial decree and moved into Nan Lin wangfu. If something happened to her, he would become the biggest suspect. So, Feng Cang temporarily hid from this \u2018plague\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, today, Feng Cang calculated wrongly. Because after Xia Yun Xi hit the wall at Tingsong building, she rested for a while and then went to the palace. Her purpose was to find Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>After returning to Guanyu building, the more Xia Yun Xi thought about it, the angrier she got. She\u2019s the dignified Dong Lu\u2019s princess. She was actually played by those servants of wangfu. Firstly, she got the wrong information. Then, a sword was directly put on her neck by Ruyi. This made her not be able to swallow this anger, no matter what.</p><br/><p>However, now she\u2019s alone without any help in Bei Zhou and no one to support her. Feng Cang didn\u2019t even want to see her. This really made Xia Yun Xi\u2019s heart hurt. In pain, Xia Yun Xi suddenly remembered Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Regardless if the rumors from the outside were true or false; no matter if the relationship between Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang was impossible to unravel, but at least, she\u2019s Feng Cang\u2019s biological little sister. They had blood ties that couldn\u2019t be severed. If she could work on Murong Qi Qi and get Murong Qi Qi\u2019s support, maybe, it would be easier to deal with Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Xia Yun Xi soaked in a bath and washed away the tiredness from her body. She put on new clothes and went to the palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, Xia Yun Xi is asking to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had just come from the underground palace with Feng Cang. Su Mei came to them and said that Xia Yun Xi had arrived. The moment Murong Qi Qi heard this, she exchanged a glance with Feng Cang. This woman really travelled everywhere. She had actually come to Long Autumn palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, isn\u2019t it better if you withdraw for a moment?! I fear that after that infatuated flower sees your \u2018countenance of a flower, face like a moon\u2019 appearance, water would flood Long Autumn palace and make this place become full of saliva.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countenance like a flower, face like a moon: very beautiful</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words revealed a sour taste. She looked carefully at this man\u2019s extraordinary and devilishly beautiful face. She sighed deeply. Why be so devilishly beautiful, ah? Fondling the flowers and trampling the grass everywhere. It would take a long time to shoot all those small flies away.</p><br/><p>Fondle the flowers and trample the grass: womanize</p><br/><p>How could Feng Cang not understand Murong Qi Qi\u2019s gaze? He pulled her into his arms. A deep kiss locked her lips. He used action to express his true feelings.</p><br/><p>Su Mei saw this couple kiss like there was no one around, and her face got red. Now, it\u2019s during the day. Miss and guye6 are already like this\u2026Cough, cough, really didn\u2019t pay attention to the location! At a side, there\u2019s still her, this unmarried girl! They\u2019re not afraid to lead her astray!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Qing Qing satisfied?\u201d After a long time, Feng Cang let go of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips. Looking at her swollen pinkish lips and her slight panting, Feng Cang\u2019s finger brushed over Murong Qi Qi\u2019s sideburn, \u201cBe good! Wait for me at night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words let Su Mei\u2019s face burn utterly red. Really, shy to death! Miss and guye are too much of that!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

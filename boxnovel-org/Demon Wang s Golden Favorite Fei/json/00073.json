She used flower-like tears to touch him, making him stand up against Feng Cang. Finally, he boosted her to the position of crown princess.</p><br/><p>Originally, Wanyan Hong believed that everything she had said was true. Only later on, did he discover that in Yu Shi Shi\u2019s heart, there\u2019s another cunning plot.</p><br/><p>That year, since Feng Cang\u2019s body became sick, Wanyan Lie finally dispelled the intention of making Feng Cang the crown prince. She couldn\u2019t become the crown princess, couldn\u2019t become the empress, that\u2019s why she cancelled the engagement before marriage. That\u2019s why she climbed onto his bed like a dog and begged him, the just-been-titled crown prince.</p><br/><p>And he was stupid enough to believe her and thought that he was the hero saving a young maiden from the claws of something evil. He didn\u2019t think that this woman didn\u2019t actually care about him one bit. All she cared about was his status, his position as crown prince and all the splendor and riches he could bring to her.</p><br/><p>Now, she gave birth to the first imperial grandson. Her position is more secure now. So, she doesn\u2019t need him anymore. Her sinking, lonely heart is also beginning to miss her old lover. She is also deliberately thinking about how to let him, a country\u2019s crown prince, wear a green hat. This woman is really a slut!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, calm down your anger!\u201d</p><br/><p>A young man, with his face covered in white powder and his lips had a touch of red paint, came to Wanyan Hong. Soft hands touched Wanyan Hong\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurting your body because of anger, this person will feel heartache!\u201d</p><br/><p>This young man was but fifteen years old. His features were delicate. It\u2019s just that his face was covered in white powder, which made it difficult to see his original face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, let Nu er1 serve you!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the boy was talking, he pulled Wanyan Hong\u2019s hand and let his hand probe into his thin clothes. When he touched the smooth surface inside, Wanyan Hong\u2019s face showed a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still Nu er who is good! Come, this crown prince will pamper you very well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, you\u2019re really bad\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the room, it was spring. Yu Shi Shi dreamed a beautiful dream. She dreamed about her and Feng Cang. He loved her very much and showed her so much affection. He let her go to the clouds and she also tried her best to meet all his\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that beloved consort is very satisfied with this crown prince\u2019s arrangement. It seems that you want more\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong\u2019s peculiar voice came into her ears. Yu Shi Shi raised her head. She saw Wanyan Hong lying on the couch at one side with a boy in his arms and he looked coldly at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi quickly pulled up the quilt to cover herself. She didn\u2019t cover herself fully yet, when Wanyan Hong\u2019s sneer went into her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to cover? Which part of your body hasn\u2019t this crown prince seen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wanyan Hong was talking to her like that in front of a boy, Yu Shi Shi was somewhat uncomfortable. Besides, the way it looked, that person of just now was certainly not Wanyan Hong. This bastard! He used such a way to humiliate her! Why does he need to treat her like this?! Doesn\u2019t he care even a bit that his woman is being insulted by others?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he saw through Yu Shi Shi and knew that she was cursing him in her heart, Wanyan Hong\u2019s big hand stroked the boy\u2019s back, but his eyes were staring at the white shoulder of Yu Shi Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend anymore in front of this crown prince! Just now, didn\u2019t you scream very happily?! If Feng Cang was here, seeing you are so infatuated with him; even when while making love, you don\u2019t forget to call out his name, he will certainly be moved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi\u2019s face paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call this crown prince. This crown prince finds you dirty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong stood up. He still hugged the boy and refused to let go.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort, since emperor father punished you with thinking behind closed-door for a month, then you can stay in the study! As for Jie er, this crown prince will let Mei cefei2 help look after him for a few days. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>While hugging the boy, Wanyan Hong walked out of the study. Immediately, someone come to lock the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she heard that Wanyan Hong wanted to let other people look after her son Wanyan Jie, she no longer cared that she was not wearing any clothes and quickly got off the bed. Barefoot, she rushed to the door and beat hard on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, your highness! Jie er is my son! Don\u2019t break us apart! No!\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to the pleas of Yu Shi Shi, Wanyan Hong didn\u2019t turn around. His mouth showed a satirical smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook after crown princess well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong left with big steps, leaving Yu Shi Shi a cruel back. Seeing that he\u2019s so cold and ruthless, Yu Shi Shi gritted her teeth. In her eyes was only hate. He finds her dirty? Why doesn\u2019t he take a look at himself and see how disgusting he is? If she had known that he was a pervert and liked men, she wouldn\u2019t have chosen him. It would\u2019ve been better to choose the sick Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>Thinking of Feng Cang, thinking about everything she had missed, thinking about the ridicule she had suffered at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands in the day, Yu Shi Shi hated so much that her teeth itched. Was he not sick and about to die? Why was he now getting better every day? If she had known that it would be like this, she wouldn\u2019t have cancelled the marriage.</p><br/><p>What should she do now? Wanyan Hong\u2019s meaning was to put her in captivity and also put Wanyan Jie under Mei Ji. How could she let that happen?!</p><br/><p>That is the child she carried for ten months before finally giving birth to him. How could he be put at Mei Ji, that whore\u2019s side?! She had used a lot of effort to let Wanyan Hong finally climb into her bed. Even thought it was just one time, but she had a lucky life and got a son with the first try. Now that slut Mei Ji was given that advantage for free. How could she let that happen?!</p><br/><p>Moreover, Wanyan Jie was the eldest imperial grandson; he\u2019s her fundamental person to settle down in the East Palace, ah! He\u2019s also her important bargaining chess piece in the imperial family, ah! This thing cannot happen. She cannot let Wanyan Hong steal the thing she relied on. Men cannot be relied on, that\u2019s fine, but she must protect her son!</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Palace.</p><br/><p>The light of the sunset fell on the red wells, making it very shiny. Empress dowager Dongfang Lan leaned on a rocking chair. In her arms, she held a white poodle. Beside her stood Qing Gu, who had followed her for half her life.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Gu, you say that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t suffer at the hands of Bao Zhu and that girl from Mu family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, empress dowager niangniang3.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d Dongfang Lan laughed twice. In her mind emerged that pair of bright like the spring sun eyes of Murong Qi Qi. Who do they resemble? This feeling was really familiar\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She thought for a long time, but still couldn\u2019t think of who Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes resembled. In the end, Dongfang Lan simply didn\u2019t think about it anymore. Instead, she switched to another topic: \u201cQing Gu, yesterday aijia4 didn\u2019t dream about Ming Yue. You say, is it that Ming Yue and Feng Xie went to reincarnate with their child? Since Ming Yue\u2019s suicide, every night aijia will dream about them. But yesterday, they didn\u2019t come. Aijia is really not accustomed\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the empress dowager\u2019s white hairs, Qing Gu took a coat and draped it over her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, this is a good thing, ah! Do the folk not say that when dreaming about a family member who passed away, it means that this family member couldn\u2019t let go of the loved one(s) on earth and is reluctant to go into reincarnation. Now, you didn\u2019t dream about princess and prince consort, maybe they know that emperor is filial to you, that\u2019s why they are finally at ease and the whole family went to reincarnate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Gu\u2019s explanation let Dongfang Lan nod her head thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cReincarnate is good lest to let aijia worry about them every day. Qing Gu, ah. It\u2019s been so many years. Only you still stayed at aijia\u2019s side and still call aijia miss\u2026\u2026The emperor is indeed filial but after all, he is not aijia\u2019s biological son. Qing Gu, after aijia passes away, you also leave! You\u2019ve served aijia for so many years, you should also consider about yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress dowager, what are you saying? Is this not driving Qing Gu away?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Dongfang Lan\u2019s words, Qing Gu immediately knelt in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Gu\u2019s life was saved by miss. Wherever miss is, is where Qing Gu will be! Even if miss is gone, Qing Gu will go to the imperial mausoleum to guard miss! Qing Gu won\u2019t go away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up, get up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan pulled Qing Gu up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?! For aijia, you didn\u2019t marry. Could it be that you want aijia to let you stay till death? Listen to aijia; if aijia is gone, you also leave! Don\u2019t stay at the icy imperial mausoleum. It\u2019s too cold there. You also need to have your own life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress dowager..\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anymore. It\u2019s settled like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan stood up and put the poodle on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow, go play by yourself! Don\u2019t go too far away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWang wang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The poodle called Little Snow barked twice and then ran out.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Gu, you say, Murong Qi Qi and aijia made a bet; will she win? How come aijia feels that this time, Cang er is bent on marring this girl. Ai, it\u2019s not that aijia is devoid of sense. It\u2019s just, the moment aijia thinks about her identity, aijia\u2019s heart will have a thorn stabbing it; very uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince princess Zhao Yang accepted, miss, why don\u2019t you just wait for the result?! If she wins, then it\u2019s her and wangye\u2019s fate. It indicates that their red strings have really been pulled together by Yue Lao, then you just need to wait to carry a great-grandchild! If miss wins, then is that not even better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Lao is the god of marriage. He binds the red strings of people together in his temple. Read my other book Seven unfortunate lifetimes, all thanks to a moment of impulse to know more about the disciple of Yue Lao, Xiao Xiang Zi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAijia is worried that if aijia wins, Cang er will refuse to take a wife, then what should aijia do? Feng family only has one descendant left. It\u2019s not like aijia can let the bloodline end here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Gu escorted Dongfang Lan and chuckled: \u201cMiss, in the end, you\u2019re still too kind-hearted and love Cang wangye5 dearly. Since this thing has already been settled, then just look at how everyone\u2019s fate will play out! Even if princess Zhao Yang loses, they wouldn\u2019t be able to blame you. However, don\u2019t blame this slave for talking too much, if princess Zhao Yang wins, will you really let go of the past and hold the wedding for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Qing Gu say that, Dongfang Lan paused in her tracks. Her eyes swept over her (DFL) once: \u201cDoes aijia look like someone who\u2019s dishonest? If Bei Zhou can come first in the tournament of the four countries, aijia will certainly hold a grand wedding for them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tournament of the four countries started with the demise of former Qin. Before, it was every state of former Qin choosing the best people to come to the capital to participate in the tournament. It was similar to the literary exam. Only when former Qin was divided by the three families, did it officially become a \u2018tournament\u2019 and Dong Lu also came to participate.</p><br/><p>Starting twenty-five years ago, from the moment Bei Zhou, Xi Qi and Nan Feng were founded until now, every five years, the tournament of the four countries was held. Although in between, the countries had some conflicts and war, but this tournament was never stopped. It\u2019s still held every five years.</p><br/><p>There were some special rules for this tournament. For example, there\u2019s no limit for the number of contestants. As long as the country had and was willing to let that person participate, even if you sent out a hundred of people, it\u2019s not a problem. If the ability was not enough, then you could overwhelm the other party with the number of contestants!</p><br/><p>However, because there were too many people, to have one after another battle would be a waste of time. Also to guard against a sea of people appearing at the same time, there would be a knockout competition first. During the knockout competition, there would be a big \u2018cleaning\u2019. The people who survived in the end were the ones who really could enter the tournament finals.</p><br/><p>As for where the tournament of the four countries was being held, it\u2019s at the country who lost the last time. And the content of the knockout competition would be decided by the country who won last time.</p><br/><p>Although there\u2019s no rule, but the tournament of the four countries had always been held in the sixteen states of You Yun. The sixteen states of You Yun were originally a fort with the expertise in attacks and also the best place to retreat to. That year, none of the four countries could give up on the sixteen states of You Yun, but no one had the ability to take over this place. In the end, the four countries could only split it. They split the sixteen states of You Yun into Bei four states, Xi four states, Nan four states and Dong four states in order to consolidate the balance.</p><br/><p>Although Bei Zhou\u2019s national strength and military strength was the strongest among the four countries, the national capacity as whole was strong, but it had very few top figures. The tournament of the four countries had been held for a total of four times, and Bei Zhou had never been the winner. This let Bei Zhou feel embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo participate in the tournament, men can\u2019t be over twenty-three years and women can\u2019t be over eighteen years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this one rule, Murong Qi Qi laughed out loud. Her elbow stabbed at Feng Cang, who was sitting at one side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, looking at your age, you cannot participate in this tournament, ah! Since it\u2019s like this, what to do? If those people happen to not be useful, and Bei Zhou loses, then what to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was twenty-five years old this year. According to the rules of the tournament, he was naturally too old to participate. Seeing Murong Qi Qi use his age to make fun of him, Feng Cang played with Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Qing Qing dislikes me for being old? Or is it that Qing Qing likes the younger ones such as general Shangguan?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

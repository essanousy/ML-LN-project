Jing De had only seen such a Wanyan Lie twice.</p><br/><p>The first time was after Yandang mountain. Li Qiu Shui had handed Wanyan Ming Yue over to Wanyan Lie. When he saw the pale Wanyan Ming Yue who didn\u2019t wake up, Wanyan Lie cried. The second time was now.</p><br/><p>The emperor, who was unreachable in the eyes of the world, was now crying helplessly like a child. Jing De\u2019s eyes got wet. He turned his face away and wiped his tears with his sleeve.</p><br/><p>Following Wanyan Lie for so many years, Jing De had seen too many things. Even Jing De himself was bit confused. He didn\u2019t know how to describe Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>To say he\u2019s a bad person, but he\u2019s honest, upright and loved the citizens like his children. To say he\u2019s a good person, but Yandang mountain\u2019s two hundred thousand lives were destroyed by his hand. Even Jing De, who\u2019d followed Wanyan Lie for the longest, didn\u2019t know how to describe this emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, don\u2019t be too sad. If princess can hear you, she will certainly not wish you to be like this.\u201d Jing De came to Wanyan Lie\u2019s side. He took out a clean handkerchief and handed it over. \u201cIf you\u2019re like this, princess Ming Yue will also be sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jing De\u2019s words let tears accumulate in Wanyan Lie\u2019s eyes. It was like a broken river had poured down.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing De, you don\u2019t understand, ah! Yue er1 hates me! So, she would rather sleep than to wake up! She hates me from the bottom of her heart\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie gently patted Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hand. He shook his head and his lips shivered a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er, if I say that I know I am wrong, will you forgive me? Can you open your eyes and look at me once? Only once\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie raised his head. When he looked at Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s face, he was suddenly startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seeing that Wanyan Lie had quieted down, Jing De also walked over. When he looked closer, he saw that the red bean hairpin on Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hair had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe came! He certainly must\u2019ve come before!\u201d Wanyan Lie jumped off the warm jade bed. He came to the front bedside. He carefully inspected once.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Jing De, that person had come! He took the red bean hairpin. He also changed Yue er\u2019s clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The last words were almost shouted by Wanyan Lie. Aside from combing Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hair, he asked palace maids to change her clothes. Every time, the palace maid who\u2019d changed Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s clothes would be killed by him. So, no one ever saw Wanyan Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>Now, the red bean hairpin in Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hair was gone. The dress on her body had also been changed. How could Wanyan Lie not be shocked? How could he not be angry?!</p><br/><p>The person, who he had never touched and was held in the palm of his hand like a baby, had been touched by another man. Wanyan Lie was so angry that his gritted teeth made sounds. He obviously had sent people over. The whole Long Autumn palace was defended like an iron wall by his people. Why did such a thing still happen? How did that person enter the underground palace? How was he able to do such a thing?!</p><br/><p>\u201cJing De, quickly go investigate! Who was it that touched princess Ming Yue?! Find that person!\u201d</p><br/><p>The last sentence was completely roared out by Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>He had never thought that such a person will appear and disturb his dream of sixteen years. Wanyan Lie had an intuition. This person would certainly take Wanyan Ming Yue away, just like his dreams.</p><br/><p>No! He couldn\u2019t let such a thing happen! He absolutely won\u2019t allow such a person to appear again! Because of Feng Xie, his hands were already stained with blood. Although he didn\u2019t want to, but he also wouldn\u2019t mind his hands getting stained with blood again!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d When Jing De saw Wanyan Lie acting so out of control, he was about to leave, but after seeing something, his mouth dropped open.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmp\u2026emperor\u2026,\u201d Jing De\u2019s expression was extremely strange. His finger pointed behind Wanyan Lie. Wanyan Lie\u2019s gaze followed Jing De\u2019s finger. He discovered that Wanyan Ming Yue had sat up and looked directly at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie cried out from surprise. His expression wasn\u2019t much better than Jing De\u2019s. \u201cYue er, is it really you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Wanyan Lie to understand, Wanyan Ming Yue smiled slightly. The smile was still there, but the person disappeared. In just a moment, she appeared in front of Wanyan Lie and hit his pressure point.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Jing De felt pain in his back. His pressure point was also hit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er, Yue er, what do you want to do\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie was very shocked. After that, something more shocking occurred to him.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan, Wanyan Kang, Feng Cang, Ming Yue Cheng, Jin Mo\u2026many familiar and unfamiliar people appeared in front of him. What is going on? Wanyan Lie looked in disbelief at Wanyan Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI disappointed you.\u201d Wanyan Ming Yue right hand touched her face, tore down a transparent mask and revealed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie\u2019s surprise turned into anger from being deceived. \u201cWhere did you hide Yue er? Where is Yue er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have the face to mention Ming Yue?!\u201d Dongfang Lan was so angry that her lips turned blue. Just now, they had been hiding in another secret lane. So, they had heard Wanyan Lie\u2019s every word very clearly.</p><br/><p>The truth had come out about what had happened sixteen years ago at Yandang mountain, but no one had ever thought that the secret was like this. It was actually Wanyan Lie, this country\u2019s emperor, who\u2019d sold the military intelligence to the enemy\u2019s country. From this, he\u2019d made two hundred thousand men of Bei Zhou die on the battlefield. Him being like this, how could he be worthy of Bei Zhou\u2019s citizens?! How could he be worthy of the dynasty?!</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress mother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call aijia2 empress mother!\u201d Because of anger, the ruby in the phoenix mouth of Dongfang Lan\u2019s phoenix crown trembled slightly. \u201cAijia doesn\u2019t have a son like you! When your consort mother died and you were still a baby, it was aijia who\u2019d brought you up. I treated you like my own, but how did you repay aijia? You ruined Ming Yue! Ruined Feng Xie! Ruined so many people! You\u2019re not eligible to call aijia empress mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan was very furious. The son she\u2019d raised was actually a thankless wretch. He\u2019d actually did such a thing to her daughter, letting them be separated for sixteen years. All was thanks to this person in front of her.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s words made a trace of guilt flash in Wanyan Lie\u2019s eyes. Indeed, he had grown up under Dongfang Lan\u2019s care. Dongfang Lan didn\u2019t treat him as an outsider. Instead, she\u2019d helped him when it was time to legalize a new emperor. All these good turns, he remembered them. It was just, he loved Wanyan Ming Yue. This matter of fact couldn\u2019t be changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress mother, where is Yue er?\u201d At this time, Wanyan Lie was most concerned about Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s safety. After seeing Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Lie understood that he had fallen into a net. Those who\u2019d cast the net were the people in front of him.</p><br/><p>Since they cast a net and waited to catch him, then did this mean that Wanyan Ming Yue had already woken up? Since it was like this, what he wanted most now was to see Wanyan Ming Yue!</p><br/><p>\u201cShe left! She didn\u2019t want to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s words were like a bolt from the blue and made Wanyan Lie\u2019s brain make a \u2018weng\u2019 sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be! Yue er wouldn\u2019t be like this!\u201d Wanyan Lie shook his head. He didn\u2019t dare and also didn\u2019t want to believe Dongfang Lan\u2019s words. The words he\u2019d said for so many days at Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s ears, Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t believe that Wanyan Ming Yue hadn\u2019t heard them. If she understood his heart, she would certainly take pity on his difficulties and certainly wouldn\u2019t heartlessly leave him like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress mother, you are lying to me, isn\u2019t it? Yue er is just angry and temporarily refused to see me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s expression was very pitiful, making people couldn\u2019t bear to hurt him. However, his expression turned into disgust in Dongfang Lan\u2019s eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t call aijia\u2019s Ming Yue. She will never see you again! Never will!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s anger got to her brain. She was emotionally agitated. Her body also shook.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial grandmother!\u201d Wanyan Kang quickly supported Dongfang Lan. He helped her sit. \u201cImperial grandmother, don\u2019t get angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s mood was very complicated. Yesterday, Murong Qi Qi had called him to Long Autumn palace and took him to the underground palace. She also told him about Wanyan Lie\u2019s things.</p><br/><p>When he saw this underground palace, Wanyan Kang\u2019s eyes almost fell out. He never knew that there was such an underground palace in Long Autumn palace. However, even if there was an underground palace, Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t believe Murong Qi Qi. He felt that she made up lies to deceive him.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Ming Yue had already passed away sixteen years ago. How could she have been hidden in the underground palace by emperor father?! And great general Feng Xie, in the past, he (WK) went to Fengyu villa and also offered sacrifice for Feng Xie, how did Feng Xie come back to life?</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t believe it. Murong Qi Qi also didn\u2019t force him. Instead, she invited him to come see such a play today. Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t reject Murong Qi Qi\u2019s invitation. He knew his emperor father. Wanyan Lie wouldn\u2019t violate proper human relationships.</p><br/><p>Although Wanyan Kang absolutely believed in Wanyan Lie, but he did hear Wanyan Lie\u2019s words very clearly just now in the underground palace. Wanyan Lie himself admitted his abnormal love towards Wanyan Ming Yue, making Wanyan Kang unable to react for some time. How could it be like this? Why was Wanyan Lie such a person and would do such a thing?</p><br/><p>Immediately, the image of Wanyan Lie in Wanyan Kang\u2019s heart collapsed. That emperor father whom he\u2019d admired for a long time, now no longer existed.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t want to go look at Wanyan Lie, because it\u2019s still emotionally difficult for him to accept the matter of just now. Why was it like this? Why did Wanyan Lie hide it so deep?</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang wasn\u2019t a fool. He knew that this thing really happened. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t lie to him. At this point, his mood was very complicated. The real side of the idol he always worshipped was actually like this. As a son, Wanyan Kang could really not accept it!</p><br/><p>\u201cI found it!\u201d At this moment, the silent Ming Yue Cheng took out a green bamboo whistle from Wanyan Lie\u2019s clothes. \u201cThis is it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes lit up. This whistle was presumably the whistle which Ming Yue Cheng said could control the mother gu. \u201cPlease, it\u2019s up to you now!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Lie saw this, he suddenly came to the realization. It seemed that they\u2019ve long suspected him. They just camouflaged it well on the surface. \u201cYou already knew?\u201d Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t go look at Ming Yue Cheng and also didn\u2019t bother with Feng Cang. Instead, he looked at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, we should thank Ming Yue Cheng. If it wasn\u2019t for him, we wouldn\u2019t have known that the mother gu was in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s answer made Wanyan Kang who was keeping Dongfang Lan company at a side, raise his head suddenly. He understood the thing called gu. Before, Ming Yue Cheng specifically told him about the use of gu of Nan Feng\u2019s Qiang tribe. Now, hearing Wanyan Lie and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s dialogue, Wanyan Kang just understood that the things Ming Yue Cheng talked about before had a profound meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho got infected with the gu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t answer Wanyan Kang. Instead, she looked at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, you got infected with the gu? Who did it?\u201d When he asked this, Wanyan Kang already saw the answer from Feng Cang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>It was Wanyan Lie again? It was his good emperor father again? Wanyan Kang shook his head. He couldn\u2019t believe it, but the facts were placed in front of him, making him unable not to believe these.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, I will explain a lot of things to you later. Now, we need to get rid of the gu poison for Feng Cang!\u201d Ming Yue Cheng brought the whistle to his mouth. He began to play gently.</p><br/><p>Originally, it was just an ordinary bamboo whistle, but on Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s mouth, it was able to produce a crisp melody.</p><br/><p>That tune had an exotic flavour. With careful thought, one could guess that this must be Qiang\u2019s tribe unique set of music for the gu. It was specifically to tame the gu that this song was compiled.</p><br/><p>1. Er: term of endearment</p><br/><p>2. Aijia: I, used by an empress dowager</p><br/>\n</div>"}

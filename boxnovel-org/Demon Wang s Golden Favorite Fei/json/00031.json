From clothes and jewelries to home decorations. He even sent snacks from Bei Zhou. In short, everything a wangfei 2 should have, Feng Cang had prepared them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess is really beautiful, wearing our Bei Zhou\u2019s clothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yu stood in front of Murong Qi Qi with a face full of glee. Feng Yu is the aunt Feng Cang sent. She\u2019s Feng family\u2019s servant. Only because her family had shown loyalty, generation after generation, that she was bestowed the surname \u2018Feng\u2019.</p><br/><p>Through living together these past few days, Feng Yu had become very satisfied with Murong Qi Qi, this future Nan Lin wangfei. The same etiquette,Feng Yu only needed to show it once, Murong Qi Qi would learn it very well. No need to show it a second time.</p><br/><p>Feng Yu had seen many noble ladies in Bei Zhou, but she\u2019d never met one who learned so quickly. Just after a few days, Feng Yu felt that whatever she knew,Murong Qi Qi now knew. She\u2019s nearly becoming useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what our miss wears, it\u2019ll look good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei had high expectations for the future guye3. At least for now, Su Mei was very satisfied about the attitude Feng Cang showed towards Murong Qi Qi. Besides, this guye seemed really attentive. Even her and Su Yue\u2019s clothes have been prepared. It seemed that this guye really knew how to \u2018follow the mass line\u2019!</p><br/><p>Su Yue really liked Bei Zhou\u2019s clothes. The upper half and bottom half were separated. Bei Zhou\u2019s folk were also not as strict as the south. Women could ride a horse and play football. This was really to Su Yue\u2019s personality.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough miss is very beautiful when wearing a dress, but wearing Bei Zhou\u2019s clothes makes miss look more valiant and easy going!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue\u2019s evaluation was very fair.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt Feng Yu, these few days have been a trouble for you to teach me, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi respectfully thanked Feng Yu according to Bei Zhou\u2019s etiquettes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo, princess, what are you doing?! Such a big etiquette, I won\u2019t be able to accept it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yu quickly helped Murong Qi Qi up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are what this slave should do. Princess shouldn\u2019t be like this anymore in the future. If outsiders see it, it\u2019ll be bad for princess. You are the futurewangfei. This slave is always just a slave. Should pay attention to the hierarchy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt Feng Yu, there are no outsiders now. Could it be that aunt wants to tell other people?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue smiled while looking at aunt Feng Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur family\u2019s miss is thanking aunt sincerely. Aunt, don\u2019t refuse it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Su Yue said it very reasonably, but Feng Yu still didn\u2019t dare to be so rash. Before she came, Feng Cang said a thousand times to let her serveMurong Qi Qi well. Feng Yu had stayed at wangfu4 for so long and had never seen Feng Cang care so much about a miss. Even to Bei Zhou\u2019s Princess Bao Zhu and the number one talented woman Mu Yu Die, wangye5 didn\u2019t show a good face.</p><br/><p>Earlier, Feng Yu still had some doubts about this bestowed princess, the future Nan Lin wangfei, but after getting along these past few days, Feng Yu felt thatFeng Cang\u2019s eyes were very good.</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi\u2019s looks were ordinary, but she\u2019s agile and intelligent. Her personality was generous and gentle. Just with learning Bei Zhou\u2019s language, the teacher had only taught for three days and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s accent scared the teacher so much that he nearly kowtowed to let Murong Qi Qi become his teacher.</p><br/><p>With such a pleasant person next to wangye, presumably wangye will get better soon!</p><br/><p>How could Feng Yu know that the so-called Bei Zhou\u2019s language was exactly the same as Mandarin of the future. For Murong Qi Qi, this was a piece of cake.</p><br/><p>Only speaking after learning for three days was because Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t want to scare the teacher, but she didn\u2019t expect that she would still frighten the teacher. The teacher kept saying \u2018princess is talented\u2019. Su Mei and Su Yueturned him into a joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, it is time for the teaching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue looked at the time and reminded her.</p><br/><p>The so-called teaching, aside from learning Bei Zhou\u2019s language, there\u2019s also Bei Zhou\u2019s history.</p><br/><p>The teacher Feng Cang sent was actually not over twenty-six years old. He\u2019s in fact a young talent named Nalan Xin. After Murong Qi Qi opened her mouth to speak Bei Zhou\u2019s language and scared Nalan Xin, the class of language was skipped. Nalan Xin began to teach Murong Qi Qi Bei Zhou\u2019s history.</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin didn\u2019t know with what words he could describe this student. Have to say, this princess Zhao Yang is exceptionally intelligent. Just with some teaching, she\u2019s able to learn by analyzing. Originally, Nalan Xin didn\u2019t understand why wangye chose Murong Qi Qi, but now he totally understood.Wangye was insightful and saw a pearl. Only such a glowing pearl is worthy ofFeng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDa Lu has four countries: Bei Zhou, Xi Qi, Nan Feng and Dong Lu. Dong Lu country is the oldest. From the beginning of its dynasty till now, it\u2019s already 238 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBei Zhou, Xi Qi and Nan Feng formed 25 years ago. At that time for some reason, the then great general Wanyan Zhi occupied the north and established Bei Zhou. The minister of personnel Longze Lan established Xi Qi. Guo Zhang Ming unknowingly established Nan Feng which resulted in the world being split into four!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin didn\u2019t know why Feng Cang wanted him to tell Murong Qi Qi about this. Murong Qi Qi is only a woman, why did she have to know so much? But this was Feng Cang\u2019s command, he could only follow it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I heard that Dong Lu is not big. How did it exist for so long even when facing with other countries being usurped?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s question made Nalan Xin nod approvingly. He had forgotten that just now, he\u2019d thought that Murong Qi Qi was just a woman and didn\u2019t need to know so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, Dong Lu is near the sea. Their maritime industry is very well developed and their relationship with Peng Lai Island is very good. Every empress of Dong Lu is a student of Peng Lai Island. If the country is met with crisis, Peng Lai island will definitely come forward to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, Dong Lu produces salt. Salt is something commoners must have. Although other countries have vast land, but they still need Dong Lu for salt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng Lai Island?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi thought of the legendary Peng Lai fairyland, but this Peng Lai Island was not the same as the one in the legend.</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin especially took a day off to tell her about Peng Lai Island. He heard that over there, martial experts were as much as clouds. The great purple level seven experts from Da Lu are just small level disciples at Peng Lai Island.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s really such a place, I really need to find an opportunity to go take a look! As Murong Qi Qi is thinking, Peng Lai Island made all the combative cells on her body jump. Don\u2019t know with her current ability, what position she would get in Peng Lai Island?</p><br/><p>In a house in the capital, Feng Yu and Nalan Xin were standing respectfully behind a man in white clothes. One hand was holding a container with fish food, the other hand tossed the fish food in the pond in front of him, attracting a group of koi.</p><br/><p>koi</p><br/><p>Koi</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Wangfei performed so well?\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to the two\u2019s report, Feng Cang\u2019s mouth showed a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that this little wangfei is a somewhat unpredictable woman! It was hard on you two!\u201d</p><br/><p>The happiness revealed inside Feng Cang\u2019s words was sincere. Feng Yu andNalan Xin lowered their heads slightly to express their respect to this man in front of them. Being able to make wangye happy, they were also happy. But all of these were thanks to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>1. Yuan: mansion/residence </p><br/><p>2. Wangfei: the wife of the wangye</p><br/><p>3.

Inside his phoenix eyes was laughter. He pulled at the snow-white fur on his body. Then he took off his coat, revealing the white inside it. When he was about to take off his underwear, Murong Qi Qi was so scared she grabbed Feng Cang\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye1, I was joking! Really!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! If I don\u2019t let Qing Qing look, Qing Qing will feel that it\u2019s unfair. Besides, I looked at Qing Qing. Now, I\u2019m letting Qing Qing look at me. I should return politeness with politeness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi shook her head and bit her lips. This time, the joke went too far. If Su Yue and the others saw Feng Cang\u2019s clothes being untidy, they would think they did something in the carriage. By then won\u2019t she feel shameful to death?!</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, don\u2019t want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang smiled with a smile that was yet not like a smile at Murong Qi Qi; looking at her blood red face, her red neck and that pair of beautiful eyes full of tension.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hua\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The curtain has been opened, revealing Wanyan Kang\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t cousin in law want?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Kang saw the scene in front of him clearly, he was truly stunned. His eyes widened and his finger pointed while trembling at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, you, this beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>The original sweet fragment between a couple, in the eyes of Wanyan Kang turned into Feng Cang took of his clothes and wanted to force himself on Murong Qi Qi. Plus, with the scream from Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Kang could imagine how Murong Qi Qi, this little white rabbit, \u2018suffered\u2019 at the hands of Feng Cang, the wolf.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother! No matter how impatient you are, you should wait till the wedding night, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wanyan Kang deliberately distort the right from wrong, Feng Cang\u2019s palm went at him. Wanyan Kang was scared and quickly retracted</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, you want to silent (kill) me, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s scream came from outside the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you say one more word, when we go back, I\u2019ll let uncle find ten women for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang put on his clothes, pulled the curtain and looked at Wanyan Kang. The threat in his voice was very strong. Wanyan Kang quickly closed his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything. I don\u2019t know anything. You, continue! Aiya, the weather is so good today. The sun is really big, ah! Haha! Being young is so good!\u201d</p><br/><p>The adapting to the circumstances Wanyan Kang, quickly looked at the sky and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang pulled down the curtain. At the time, Murong Qi Qi truly wanted to faint. Her face was burning and red. Her head buried completely in Feng Cang\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kid is used to being like this! When I go back, I\u2019ll deal with him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi and softly apologized. This little woman\u2019s face is thin skinned. He also is. Now, his heart is still jumping very hard. Damn! When they go back, they must marry quickly! By then he can bill and coo with Murong Qi Qi openly!</p><br/><p>Till they arrived at the venue, did Murong Qi Qi leave Feng Cang\u2019s embrace. After they came down the carriage, Wanyan Kang whistled at them. Murong Qi Qi blushed once again. Until Feng Cang\u2019s eyes swept over Wanyan Kang, did he touch his nose and hide at a side.</p><br/><p>The venue for the finals was like a stage. In the middle was stone build round platform. It was surrounded by a circle of semicircular two story small building. It\u2019s specifically for people to watch the game.</p><br/><p>Because the contestants of Nan Feng and Dong Lu had been eliminated- Nan Feng\u2019s contestant already returned to their country- so, this time only Xi Qi\u2019s, Bei Zhou\u2019s contestants and the people of Dong Lu who came to watch at the venue.</p><br/><p>The people of Dong Lu have long arrived. The one in the lead was Jia Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan waved from his seat at Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang nodded in answer. He took Murong Qi Qi to the seats of Bei Zhou\u2019s contestants. Not long after, Xi Qi\u2019s contestants also arrived.</p><br/><p>Because it was a once in every five years\u2019 tournament between the four countries, many citizens also came to the venue. They wanted to watch this rare tournament. Fortunately, the venue was big enough. So, the citizens who came also had a place to sit.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu also came to see the tournament. Since Feng Cang got to know from Murong Qi Qi that Wanyan Bao Zhu was a fake, he let people \u2018serve\u2019 her more attentively. They served her like a real princess, made Wanyan Bao Zhu forgot the shock of before and thought that she really got away with it.</p><br/><p>When she arrived at the venue, with one glance, Wanyan Bao Zhu saw Longze Jing Tian sitting at Xi Qi\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Dup, dup! Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart beat very fast. She never thought that she\u2019ll ever be able to see Longze Jing Tian again. She also never expected to see him at this place.</p><br/><p>Although this man had hurt her, but he was the first man she loved. He was her first love and also her first man. So, after seeing Longze Jing Tian, the emotions in Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart were difficult to contain. The extinguished flamed burned again. She forgot that she was at the venue and also forgot that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi were at her side. She actually walked to Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, who are you? What do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Wanyan Bao Zhu to get to Longze Jing Tian, she has been stopped by Murong Qing Lian. Murong Qing Lian didn\u2019t know this Bei Zhou\u2019s princess, but she came from over where Murong Qi Qi was. Murong Qing Lian didn\u2019t have good feelings for Murong Qi Qi, so, she stopped Wanyan Bao Zhu even before she (WBZ) had the chance to get close to Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>The moment Wanyan Bao Zhu saw the person who stopped her was Murong Qing Lian, she frowned. How come it\u2019s her? Why is fourth little sister here? Thinking again, Murong Qing Lian was an excellent figure among the young generation, she must\u2019ve come to participate in the tournament. However in her (MQL) eyes were no kindness. This made Wanyan Bao Zhu somewhat unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to ask, are you Xi Qi\u2019s Jing wang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Murong Qing Lian, Wanyan Bao Zhu went around her and came to Longze Jing Tian. The way she looked at him was full of infatuation as well as memories from the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian lowered his head. Looking at that infatuated expression of Wanyan Bao Zhu, he immediately frowned. Why is every woman around him so infatuated? Why is it that aside from Murong Qi Qi, there\u2019s no one who isn\u2019t infatuated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The words were about to leave her mouth, when Wanyan Bao Zhu suddenly stopped. How should she tell Longze Jing Tian? Should she say that she\u2019s Murong Xin Lian? That\u2019s impossible! Right! Now she\u2019s Bei Zhou\u2019s princess! She must come up with a princess\u2019s style!</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong2 is Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Bao Zhu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026don\u2019t know what brought princess here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian narrowed his eyes. He was somewhat impatient. It\u2019s just Wanyan Bao Zhu didn\u2019t notice it. She was just thinking about another problem.</p><br/><p>Now, she\u2019s is not Murong fu\u2019s3 second miss Murong Xin Lian anymore, but she\u2019s Bei Zhou\u2019s princess Bao Zhu\u2014\u2013Wanyan Bao Zhu. So, she had a new identity. Did this also mean that she could begin a new life? For example, marrying Longze Jing Tian as Bei Zhou\u2019s imperial princess? Now her identity is noble. She\u2019s enough to be comparable with Longze Jing Tian. She doesn\u2019t have to be afraid of stepping a tail and beg for pity anymore.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu remained silent. She just stared at Longze Jing Tian\u2019s face in daze, making Murong Qing Lian very unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, our wangye is talking to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous!\u201d</p><br/><p>After her thoughts was cut by Murong Qing Lian, Wanyan Bao Zhu immediately snapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong is princess Bao Zhu. I\u2019m talking to Jing wang. What right do you have to interrupt?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Have to say, when a person is placed at a position, she will naturally have the aura of that position. Such as Murong Xin Lian, now her identity is a princess. Then she naturally would emit an imposing aura. Although this imposing aura couldn\u2019t be compared to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s, but to Murong Qing Lian, a daughter of a subject, it still had a certain effect.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu snapped at his country\u2019s people, made Longze Jing Tian even more unhappy. At other countries, protecting your own is a must. Immediately Longze Jing Tian opened his mouth: \u201cWhat did princess come to find benwang4 for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Longze Jing Tian didn\u2019t clearly speak up for Murong Qing Lian, but the coldness in the words and the tone of keeping people a thousand miles away, Wanyan Bao Zhu caught on with them in just a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just wangye looks like an old friend of mine. So, I came to say hi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having Longze Jing Tian\u2019s \u2018support\u2019, Murong Qing Lian got more daring.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Princess\u2019s way to strike up with someone is very peculiar, ah! It\u2019s just don\u2019t know what the name of that old friend of princess\u2019s is. How is he like our wangye, ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Longze Jing Tian didn\u2019t bring Lu Yuan and Lu Ye on the journey. Plus, the fact that his feet got injured in the pagoda, it was inconvenient to apply medicine. Murong Qing Lian in the name of \u2018wangye got hurt because of me, I should ho take care of him\u2019 applied medicine every day for him.</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian wanted to take this opportunity to do a good job and also wanted to get Longze Jing Tian\u2019s attention because of this. Because of her hard work, Longze Jing Tian gave her a bit better expression. This also became Murong Qing Lian\u2019s confidence to be smug. That\u2019s why she dared to talk like that to Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>Being rebuked by Murong Qing Lian openly, Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s face immediately turned red. She wanted to use her identity of princess to teach Murong Qing Lian a lesson and let her know who is the boss, but the time for the contestants to draw had arrived.</p><br/><p>Looking at Murong Qing Lian following Longze Jing Tian diligently and happily, Wanyan Bao Zhu clenched her fists. Having a Murong Qi Qi to ruin her good things, she\u2019s already very gloomy and unhappy. Now, a Murong Qing Lian appeared and she\u2019s looking so love struck at Longze Jing Tian. Wanyan Bao Zhu didn\u2019t need to think to know what\u2019s in Murong Qing Lian\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Slut! Truly a slut! She even wants to snatch her own brother in law!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu gritted her teeth. She wished her glare could burn a few holes on Murong Qing Lian\u2019s body. From her point of view, the behavior of Murong Qing Lian thinking about Longze Jing Tian was truly shameless! Because Longze Jing Tian is her (WBZ) man, is her (MQL) brother in law.</p><br/><p>She has long forgotten that from beginning to end, Longze Jing Tian had never put her in his eyes. She also forgot that she got Longze Jing Tian after using extreme means. It should be that she \u2018snatched\u2019 him from Murong Qi Qi. Now, Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart is full of hate towards Murong Qing Lian\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Slut! I\u2019ll definitely find an opportunity to deal with you!</p><br/><p>Before, at Murong fu, Murong Qing Lian relied on the fact that she was favored plus the fact that Liu Yan Zhi was also favored, she was always cynical in front of Murong Xin Lian. From time to time, she (MQL) would also gave her (MXL) a bad look.</p><br/><p>At that time, although she was beautiful but Murong Tai put more emphasis on the level four Murong Qing Lian. Plus, the fact that Liu Yan Zhi had the backing of a son, so every time the two fought, Murong Tai was always biased towards his youngest daughter. Now, it\u2019s different. Now she isn\u2019t Murong Xin Lian, but princess Bao Zhu from Bei Zhou\u2019s imperial family. She now has a noble identity. Killing people for revenge is just a small matter!</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian didn\u2019t know this Wanyan Bao Zhu is Murong Xin Lian and also didn\u2019t know that someone already set her eyes of her (MQL).</p><br/><p>Now, the thing she\u2019s most concerned about is the drawing of the sticks. In Murong Qing Lian\u2019s heart, she wished very much to draw Murong Qi Qi. By that time, she wanted to cut many scars in that proud face of Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>The drawing was split into two groups. One group would draw the number about which order they will compete. The other group would draw the name of the opponent. How they would be allocated was decided by drawing sticks.</p><br/><p>The stick Longze Jing Tian draw was to select the opponent and the one Murong Qi Qi draw was the order of the tournament. Longze Jing Tian knew the principle of letting women go first, so he let Bei Zhou draw first. Su Mei would compete first, Ruyi the second, Wanyan Kang the third and Murong Qi Qi the fourth.</p><br/><p>Now, it\u2019s Xi Qi\u2019s contestants turn to draw the opponents. Longze Jing Tian\u2019s opponent was Wanyan Kang. Li Yung Qing\u2019s was Su Mei. Bai Yi Yue would go against Ruyi. Murong Qing Lian\u2019s opponent was Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird big sister, didn\u2019t expect we would have this day as sisters; becoming opponents and appearing at the tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian triumphantly shook the stick with Murong Qi Qi\u2019s name on it. What she thought off happened. Just now, she was thinking about how she must become a pair with Murong Qi Qi. She didn\u2019t expect that she was so lucky and really picked Murong Qi Qi. It seemed that even heaven dislikes Murong Qi Qi. That\u2019s why heaven sent her (MQL) to uphold virtue and condemn evil!</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, since it\u2019s like this, then ask fourth little sister to not go too hard at the tournament!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian being so proud, Murong Qi Qi smiled. And Murong Qi Qi\u2019s smile, in Murong Qing Lian\u2019s eyes was a way of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expressing goodwill and wanting her to be easy at the tournament.</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qing Lian turned more proud.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister, I also want to take our relationship of sister into consideration, ah. However, there\u2019s no sisterhood on a battle. I\u2019m Xi Qi\u2019s contestant, naturally I should bring glory to the country, ah! Big sister, by then, don\u2019t blame me, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Act, continue act! Seeing that face of Murong Qing Lian, Murong Qi Qi was too lazy to bicker with her. She yawned. White jade like hands settled on Feng Cang\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Do whatever you like! How you\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll follow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just now, Murong Qi Qi had a modest attitude. Now, she (MQQ) pushed her (MQL) to a side. The attitude was so different, making Murong Qing Lian a bit unable to adapt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird big sister, what are you saying is the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! No matter if it\u2019s fighting with or without inner energy, bring it on. This big sister is not afraid of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi raised an eyebrow and looked provocatively at Murong Qing Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, taking into consideration that you still call me big sister, I\u2019ll let you have three strikes first. It could also be considered as taking our sisterhood into account.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi said she\u2019ll let her have three strikes, Murong Qing Lian felt great insult. Only when the opponent is very weak, would people let off three strikes as expressing mercy and sympathy to the other party. Now Murong Qi Qi, this \u2018rubbish\u2019 actually yielded strikes to her and it\u2019s three strikes. How could Murong Qing Lian who has been always hailed as genius accept it?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to yield strikes to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf big sister doesn\u2019t beg me to yield strikes, then I\u2019ll be satisfied. How would I let big sister yield strikes?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, not bad. You\u2019ve got backbone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi gave a chic smile without the coquettish of a woman. Instead it had a heroic aura. And the graceful bearing between her eyebrows, fell head-on on Longze Jing Tian and Li Yun Qing who were behind Murong Qing Lian, making them be dazzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s talk with the fists at the tournament!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly what I want!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even others could feel the thunder and lightning between the two daughters of Murong family. Wanyan Bao Zhu was far away. Although she couldn\u2019t hear anything they said, but she could see that the two went against each other. Very good! Let them be like dogs eating dogs. Then she could benefit from it without doing anything!</p><br/><p>One Murong Qi Qi, one Murong Qing Lian; these two people are the thorns in her heart. If she could get rid of two thorns through this tournament, won\u2019t that satisfy everyone? The thought that at the coming finals, these two people would either be finished or both would suffer, Wanyan Bao Zhu felt happy from the bottom of her heart. It seemed that it was a correct decision to come watch the tournament today.</p><br/><p>Four competitions. Three wins means victory. If two wins and two loses, then they need to select one contestant to compete once more. Everyone knew the rules very well. Now, they\u2019re only waiting to see the process and results.</p><br/><p>The first competition was Su Mei against Li Yun Qing.</p><br/><p>After snowing for a few days, today is a rare clear day. An orange sun lazily hung at the horizon. Smilingly, it looked at the earth. Because the sun exposed its face, the snow began to melt. The temperature was very low. Su Mei\u2019s face became red because of the cold air, like a blooming an Indian Azalea.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei er5, fighting! I\u2019ve your back! I support you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The competition hadn\u2019t started yet, Wanyan Kang made a trumpet from his hand and began to shout, making Su Mei feel ashamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting, fighting! Little Mei er is the best! Little Mei er must win! Beat him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s shouts reverberated at the venue. It happened that this venue was semicircular. The sound echoed here and there. One words seemed like a cry of a lot people, making Su Mei lose patient.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! Shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Su Mei got angry and glared at Wanyan Kang. She wished she could seal his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, I come down the platform, if you make one more noise, I\u2019ll sewn your mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei\u2019s voice was very hard. Coupled with the help of the semicircular venue, it appeared increasingly \u2018aggressive\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoo\u2026\u2026little Mei er is so fierce towards me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Being roared in front of so many people by Su Mei, Wanyan Kang immediately squatted on the ground with a crying face in a circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei er is so fierce! Very frightening!\u201d</p><br/><p>The actions of these two enemies made Murong Qi Qi have laughter in her eyes. However, now Su Mei doesn\u2019t have the time to pay attention to Wanyan Kang. From her point of view, the performances of Wanyan Kang were occasionally too childish. Her attention now is fully on Li Yun Qing who was opposite of her.</p><br/><p>Before coming, Murong Qi Qi let Moyu\u2019s people brought all information about these four Xi Qi\u2019s people. Li Yun Qing is the purple color seventh level master. His weapon is a jade flute. Although this man looked elegant like a deity and normally he seemed indifferent to everything with an indifferent expression, but he\u2019s the eldest son of Li family. He\u2019s not someone easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>However, although Li Yun Qing is powerful, but Su Mei is also not someone to be trifled with. She had been abandoned by her parents the moment she was born. Later, she was brought to Moyu by Mozun. The things she learned was kungfu about how to kill people. So, facing Li Yun Qin, Su Mei wasn\u2019t a bit afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing smiled and took out his jade flute and asked Su Mei to show her weapon.</p><br/><p>Although Su Mei wasn\u2019t afraid of Li Yun Qing, but she was also very careful. This is the opening competition. She must make a beautiful battle of it to encourage the people after her. After making up her mind, Su Mei took out her weapon. It\u2019s a half-moon-shaped dagger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Li, please!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

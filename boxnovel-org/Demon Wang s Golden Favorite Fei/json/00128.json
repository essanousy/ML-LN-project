Seeing the two pretty girls in front of her, Murong Qi Qi sighed. She walked to them. Her left hand held Su Mei, her right hand held Su Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two fools, ah! With I, your miss\u2019s ability, how would I not be able to take care of myself?! Men and women should get married once they\u2019ve come of age. You\u2019re always staying at my side, what to do if you\u2019ve missed your life?! I don\u2019t have sisters, so I took you as my close big sisters! If you aren\u2019t happy, then I also won\u2019t be happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, if you have someone you love, have a relation you want to pursue, you must let yourself go and love boldly. If the fate is missed, then it would be a regret of your whole life. I don\u2019t want to see you two sitting there regretting about the past when you\u2019re old\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made the two girls want to laugh and also become moved.</p><br/><p>Even though Murong Qi Qi was their master, but she didn\u2019t have the arrogance of a master. Instead, she was very forgiving to them. She really was like their sister. To be able to stay at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side was something to be proud of for Su Mei and Su Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cPromise me, if you find your happiness, you must bravely pursue it!\u201d Murong Qi Qi put Su Mei and Su Yue\u2019s hands together. Her hands also fell on theirs. \u201cIt won\u2019t be enough if only I was happy. All three of us need to be happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Su Yue and Su Mei\u2019s eyes become wet. They nodded.</p><br/><p>This scene fell in Nalan Xin\u2019s eyes. It seemed that wangfei 1 truly wasn\u2019t an ordinary person! Even in this time where the hierarchical system was very important, she was able to get along with her maids like sisters!</p><br/><p>These past few days, Nalan Xin had followed orders to investigate Guanghua gongzi.2 He didn\u2019t expect that this Guanghua gongzi was truly like the rumors. He was like a holy dragon without a tail. He (NX) simply couldn\u2019t find his tail.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi and Guanghua gongzi knew each other, so they should have a special way of contacting each other. Hence, Nalan Xin set his eyes on Murong Qi Qi. It was just that, usually Murong Qi Qi doesn\u2019t go out of the residence. Wangye 3 was also almost always at her side. Therefore, the one who contacted Guanghua gongzi for her must be one of her maids.</p><br/><p>Look out for Su Mei and Su Yue and find the clues from them, was the idea Nalan Xin came up with.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, look, Nalan Xin is secretly staring at Su Yue again!\u201d Su Mei had sharp eyes. With one look, she saw Nalan Xin. She immediately stabbed Murong Qi Qi at her side, \u201cLike I said, Nalan Xin took a fancy to Su Yue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Su Mei say this, Su Yue\u2019s face became red again. After Murong Qi Qi\u2019s marriage, she and Nalan Xin indeed have a few encounters. However, they didn\u2019t talk much and only nodded at each other, nothing more. Nalan Xin\u2019s character was not bad. It was just, Su Yue doesn\u2019t know if she liked him or not.</p><br/><p>Seeing Nalan Xin appear, Murong Qi Qi laughed. It seemed that there was a chance. Why doesn\u2019t she play matchmaker a bit? \u201cCough, cough! Su Yue, go to Tong Bao Zhai to see if the jewelry I\u2019d designed for the empress dowager\u2019s birthday is done. I have Su Mei to serve here, you don\u2019t need to worry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words were very blatant. It was like, you stay outside for a bit longer. Even if you don\u2019t come back, it\u2019s fine\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026,\u201d Su Yue was shy.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo! Naturally, I should bring a gift to grandmother\u2019s birthday! Usually, it was Su Mei who run the errands. Today, I need to talk with Su Mei about Wanyan Kang. It\u2019s better if you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin was far. He didn\u2019t hear what Murong Qi Qi said. Seeing Su Yue leave, he also followed.</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin following Su Yue confirmed Murong Qi Qi and Su Mei\u2019s thoughts. The two exchanged a glance and laughed. There\u2019s indeed a chance!</p><br/><p>After leaving the wangfu,4 Su Yue went directly to Tong Bao Zhai. After three days, it would be the empress dowager\u2019s birthday. Earlier, Murong Qi Qi had designed a set of jewelries called \u2018Red Phoenix Facing the Sun\u2019. All were made from the best red jade. During these past two days, it should have been completed.</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin followed not far nor near behind Su Yue. Only after seeing Su Yue enter Tong Bao Zhai, did he affirm his thoughts. Murong Qi Qi had indeed communicated with Guanghua gongzi through her maid. It was just, only knowing this was not enough. The most critical thing was finding Guanghua gongzi.</p><br/><p>Recently, even though on the surface wangye was deadly calm, but Nalan Xin, who\u2019d followed Feng Cang for a long time, felt Feng Cang\u2019s anxiously waiting heart. Presumably, everyone in love was like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Nalan, what are you doing here?\u201d When Nalan Xin came out of the daze, Su Yue was already in front of him. Once again, being in such close proximity with Su Yue made Nalan Xin\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but jump badly.</p><br/><p>Su Yue was not a very beautiful girl, but she was the kind who, the more you looked at, the more comfortable it would get. The more you looked at her, the more she was worth a second look. Especially Su Yue\u2019s eyes. They seemed like they could talk. It\u2019s said that the eyes were the windows to the soul. Presumably, this girl\u2019s heart was also very beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was only passing, turn\u2026turn\u2026,\u201d Nalan Xin didn\u2019t know why; but when Su Yue looked at him, he had a feeling of suffocation as though he couldn\u2019t breathe. It was very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Could he be possessed? Nalan Xin patted his forehead. How silly he could look like, was how silly he looked like now.</p><br/><p>Seeing Nalan Xin like this, Su Yue was somewhat anxious. Unconsciously, her hand touched his forehead. \u201cYou don\u2019t have fever, ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling the warmth of Su Yue\u2019s soft hand and smelling the fragrance from her fingertips, Nalan Xin\u2019s face turned red. Like avoiding plague, he stepped back, \u201cThat, I\u2019ll go first. I still have something to do!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Su Yue to speak, Nalan Xin fled the scene like a gust of wind.</p><br/><p>The attitude of the other party made Su Yue feel a bit injured. Could miss be wrong and Nalan Xin didn\u2019t like her? Otherwise, why would he escape so fast?</p><br/><p>At the other side, Nalan Xin was also surprised. When had he ever acted like this? Why was it whenever he saw Su Yue, his heartbeat would speed up and he wouldn\u2019t even be able to speak a full sentence?</p><br/><p>He heard that the people from Moyu were good with poisons. Presumably, Su Yue at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side, should also be an expert at poison. It was just, when did she put poison on him and let him get infected unknowingly? It seemed that in the future, he needed to stay far away from Su Yue!</p><br/><p>In just a moment, Nalan Xin gave up on the idea of inquiring about Guanghua gongzi from Su Yue. He decided to do as Feng Cang said; kidnap the people of Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang to force Guanghua gongzi to come out. It was wangye who was right; when it\u2019s necessary, using violence was the fastest solution to the problem!</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s birthday arrived as planned. During these past few years, Dongfang Lan had been staying in the temple. This was the first time that she\u2019d celebrated her birthday. Originally, the empress dowager didn\u2019t want to get so many people involved and be too extravagant. However, Wanyan Lie said that they could use this opportunity to introduce princess Zhen Guo. Only after thinking about Murong Qi Qi, did Dongfang Lan nod and accept the celebration.</p><br/><p>As the only person who had a blood relationship with her in this world, Murong Qi Qi was very respectful towards Dongfang Lan. Early in the morning, Murong Qi Qi arrived at Jinxuan palace. These past few days, aside from staying in the wangfu, she also came to Jinxuan palace to accompany the empress dowager.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt Qing, good morning!\u201d Murong Qi Qi entered smilingly. When she saw Qing Gu, she greeted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, today you came really early!\u201d Qing Gu also liked this long-lost princess very much. In the past, it was she who raised princess Ming Yue. Now, although the beauty had passed away, but Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s daughter inherited her looks and gesture, making people couldn\u2019t help but transfer their love for Ming Yue to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, has grandmother woken up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe just woke up and asked about princess. Didn\u2019t expect princess to come so soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Murong Qi Qi put the set \u2018Red Phoenix Facing the Sun\u2019 made from red jade in front of Dongfang Lan, not only Dongfang Lan, even the eyes of the palace maids at a side, almost fell out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWishing grandmother to have this day every year and that you\u2019ll have today\u2019s glory forever! May your happiness be as immense as the East Sea and may you live as long as the Zhongnan Mountains!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Good! So beautiful! Aijia5 has seen many treasures, but none were as good as the one Qi Qi gave me!\u201d With one look, Dongfang Lan fell in love with this set of jewelries. Not to mention the value, the design itself was unheard of and unseen before. Dongfang Lan didn\u2019t even know how to describe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis jewelry must be from Tong Bao Zhai, isn\u2019t that right?!\u201d Qing Gu had sharp eyes. With only one look, she could tell that this set of jewelries was out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Qing Gu recognized it, Murong Qi Qi nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right! I and Guanghua gongzi met once. It just so happened to coincide with grandmother\u2019s birthday; I especially let Guanghua gongzi create this \u2018Red Phoenix Facing the Sun\u2019 for grandmother. Grandmother, do you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike! Like! Qing Gu, today aijia will wear this \u2018Red Phoenix Facing the Sun\u2019 and let everyone know my granddaughter\u2019s filial piety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Dongfang Lan was already dressed. Now, especially for this set of jewelry from Murong Qi Qi, she\u2019d changed. When this pair of grandmother and granddaughter arrived at Taiji hall, everyone had already arrived and only waited for Dongfang Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress dowager arrived! Princess Zhen Guo arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they\u2019d heard Murong Qi Qi arrived, the officials stretched their neck, wanting to see Murong Qi Qi\u2019s appearance clearly.</p><br/><p>Ever since the moment Wanyan Lie made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity public and also bestowed her with the title of princess Zhen Guo, the officials were very curious about this offspring of Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue. Although from the palace came the news that Murong Qi Qi looked very much like Wanyan Ming Yue and was a beauty of this generation, but the things you hear may be false. Only believe in what you see.</p><br/><p>Although Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s appearance was still deeply engraved in these people\u2019s hearts, but Murong Qi Qi, that ordinary girl who\u2019d appeared on the palace banquet, how could she be Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s daughter? This news was too shocking.</p><br/><p>In order to confirm the truth, many people sharpened their heads to squeeze into Nan Lin wangfu to see Murong Qi Qi\u2019s beauty.</p><br/><p>However, Feng Cang protected Murong Qi Qi very well. He declined everyone and besides, every time Murong Qi Qi entered the palace, Feng Cang would be at her side. The carriage was also tightly covered. This made everyone\u2019s curiosity rise to the peak. So, they waited for the empress dowager\u2019s birthday. Big and small officials, all came to Taiji hall.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang\u2026\u2019 One person\u2019s chopsticks fell onto the ground. His mouth was wide open. Beautiful, so unusually beautiful\u2026</p><br/><p>Not only this person, the others also felt the same. That woman wore a yellow dress. On the dress were lilies embroidered with golden threads.</p><br/><p>Her thick black hair was in a high bun. She didn\u2019t use any jewelry. Only a yellow band fixed the hair. A few strands hung loosely and reached Murong Qi Qi\u2019s waist. With every step, they gently swung with her body like a fairy descending from heaven.</p><br/><p>The hand Wanyan Lie stroked his beard with froze when Murong Qi Qi entered.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue\u2026seeing Murong Qi Qi who looked and acted like Wanyan Ming Yue, Wanyan Lie\u2019s eyes got wet. Ming Yue, zhen6 has found Qi Qi. Are you happy?</p><br/><p>Crown prince Wanyan Hong and second prince Wanyan Yi were designated to sit at either side, and their eyes flashed amazement. Although this wasn\u2019t the first time they saw Murong Qi Qi, but every time they saw her, she was able to give them a new feeling.</p><br/><p>The hand Wanyan Hong had on Yu Shi Shi couldn\u2019t help but pinch her waist fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026,\u201d Yu Shi Shi frowned and screamed in a low voice. Wanyan Hong\u2019s strength was great. Presumably, on her waist there would be one more purple trace.</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi\u2019s scream let Wanyan Hong laugh. His aquiline nose looked sharper, \u201cIt seemed that this crown prince wasn\u2019t dreaming. This is real!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after Wanyan Hong said that, did Yu Shi Shi understand what he meant. It turned out that he thought he was dreaming after seeing the fairy like Murong Qi Qi. That was why he\u2019d pinched Yu Shi Shi hard. Only after hearing her pain, was he sure that he wasn\u2019t dreaming. This man was really despicable!</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi endured the pain and gritted her teeth. She couldn\u2019t express any trace of dissatisfaction. Recently, Wanyan Hong\u2019s attitude towards her was very bad. Yu Shi Shi knew that this change was because of Murong Qi Qi. Wanyan Hong had set his eyes on Murong Qi Qi. So, he wanted her to give up her position and give it to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Now, to Yu Shi Shi, she\u2019d come to the most critical moment in her life. She couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t give up her position of consort to others like this. Not to mention, it was Murong Qi Qi! She couldn\u2019t let Wanyan Hong pick her thorn (find any fault in her)!</p><br/><p>How would Yu Shi Shi know that Wanyan Hong already had the intention to kill her. No matter how good she performed, she was only an abandoned chess piece. She was useless, so naturally he should give up on her, lest to let her block his foot and also take up space! So, no matter what Yu Shi Shi did, her fate was only death.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi personally helped Dongfang Lan sit down. Then, she walked to her seat. Her seat was next to Feng Cang. She had just sat down when Feng Cang\u2019s handsome face came over, \u201cQing Qing, you\u2019re so beautiful today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi smiled at Feng Cang. Her small hand also reached out for Feng Cang under the table and went into Feng Cang\u2019s big hand. \u201cCang, today you\u2019re also particularly handsome and charming\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was happy from the bottom of his heart. Because today, Nalan Xin will bring people to sweep Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang in Yan capital. He already ordered to let none of those who protested to remain alive. And to tie up those still living. He would use these lives to force Guanghua gongzi to appear.</p><br/><p>All the beautiful things of this woman belonged to him. All her bad things also belonged to him. Of course, in his eyes, Murong Qi Qi was perfect without any flaws. So, no matter what happened, Murong Qi Qi was his woman. He would not allow anyone to have ideas about Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi once again use \u2018charming\u2019 to describe him, Feng Cang chuckled and revealed a smile which was able to entice all living beings. His fingers gently scratched Murong Qi Qi\u2019s palm, making Murong Qi Qi giggle.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was happy. Feng Cang was also happy. By the time the palace banquet was finished, Nalan Xin would also have done everything successfully. Guanghua gongzi always cherished his underlings. If he found out that his people were kidnapped, he would certainly take the initiative to find him (FC). By then, he would trample this rival like trampling an ant to death to avoid this man tempting his little wangfei\u2019s heart! That heart belongs to him. She had long been branded with his traces. Even if she allows it, he wouldn\u2019t agree!</p><br/><p>Seeing the intimate interaction of Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Lie was increasingly pleased. Heaven must\u2019ve felt the depression and injustice that he\u2019d felt in his heart. That was why it made such a pair of siblings to complete what he couldn\u2019t personally accomplish.</p><br/><p>This pair of children must be as pitiful as he was in the past. It was just, they were braver than he was!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Lie somewhat envied Feng Cang. At least, he\u2019s (FC) brave and had the courage to fight for his happiness. And Wanyan Lie himself, because of being siblings, he felt shameful and also deliberately avoided Wanyan Ming Yue. If he also had Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s courage, would it be different now?</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin, who\u2019s sitting beside Wanyan Lie, clearly felt the fluctuation of the moods from the man next to her. From the touch of sadness and the thick pampering from Wanyan Lie\u2019s eyes, Lin Ke Xin was certain that Wanyan Lie truly loved Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi. It seemed that she must let her son do his best more often.</p><br/><p>She heard that recently, Wanyan Kang had been frequently going to Nan Lin wangfu. It seemed that this younger son of hers forgot her hint. He truly wanted to compete for the throne with Wanyan Yi! She wouldn\u2019t allow such a thing to happen! This world is Wanyan Yi\u2019s. Even if it\u2019s Wanyan Kang, he also couldn\u2019t take it!</p><br/><p>1. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2.

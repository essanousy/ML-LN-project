Jing wang1 was raised at the empress dowager\u2019s side since he was young. He is naturally influenced her, so his character is also extraordinary. Since miss Duanmu is interested in Jing wang, you should understand what the other likes. This is also for yourself\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Has to say, Bai Yi Yue\u2019s words played a very important role. Just a moment and Duanmu Yi Yi already made decision.</p><br/><p>When they got out, everyone was waiting for them to announce the result. Duanmu Qing was staring straight at Duanmu Yi Yi. She knew this niece very well. She also knew that Duanmu Yi Yi hates Murong Qi Qi. As long as Duanmu Yi Yi deny, there will be room to maneuver.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu looked anxiously at the two. Never before has he felt that time flies so slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering his majesty, princess Zhao Yang is pure and noble.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Longze Jing Tian, for her own future, Duanmu Yi Yi calmly told the truth. Bai Yi Yue who was next to Duanmu Yi Yi nodded: \u201cPrincess Zhao Yang is indeed a good woman who knows how to love herself. Asking his majesty to give justice to princess Zhao Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Yi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing was very surprised. Inside the surprise there\u2019s also a trace of anger. Didn\u2019t Duanmu Yi Yi hate Murong Qi Qi? Why is she helping her now? Now what will happen to Longze Yu Er? If Murong Qi Qi really wants to pursue the matter, then how should she protect her daughter?</p><br/><p>Facing Duanmu Qing\u2019s eyes full of accusations, Duanmu Yi Yi lowered her head. Inside her eyes echoed the words Bai Yi Yue just said. Aunt, I\u2019m sorry! I can\u2019t let Jing wang hate me!</p><br/><p>Having these two\u2019s words, Longze Yu suddenly felt relieved. Fortunately, this Murong Qi Qi is innocent, otherwise if Feng Cang hold them accountable for casually stuffing a dirty woman at him, then it\u2019ll be big trouble.</p><br/><p>But, he just let out a breath of relief, Longze Yu began to have a headache again. Since Murong Qi Qi is innocent, then isn\u2019t it that Longze Yu Er slandered her?</p><br/><p>According to the agreement, Murong Qi Qi will get Longze Yu Er\u2019s life! Although the child didn\u2019t live to his expectations, but she is still his biological child. If she is killed under his own eyes, when this get out, what will the citizens think? How will the world laugh at him?</p><br/><p>Seemingly to be aware of her situation now, Longze Yu Er changed her arrogance. Her whole body began to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Ping Yang, are you going to do it yourself or should I give you a ride?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pretending to not see that Longze Yu Er is backing off step by step, Murong Qi Qi pulled out the dagger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough bengong[2 Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family] has never killed anyone before and also didn\u2019t kill chicken, duck or anything, but just now when wangye cut off princess Xin\u2019s hands, bengong watched carefully and learned a lot. Although I can\u2019t do it as neat as wangye, but you can be at ease, bengong will try to make you not feel pain. Really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was smiling. Her voice was so gentle. If it wasn\u2019t that very word was threatening, then others would\u2019ve just thought that she was chatting.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Murong Qi Qi was being so harmless, the more people will feel their blood run cold. Longze Yu Er shook her head and stepped back. She didn\u2019t want to be like Ming Yue Xin. She didn\u2019t want to end like her. She is a princess! How dare Murong Qi Qi to be so rude to her?</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Longze Yu Er to finish talking, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expression changed: \u201cNo? How can we do that?! Do you think bengong is easily bullied? The dignified Nan Lin wangfei2 was actually forced to prove her innocence in Xi Qi country\u2019s feast. If this gets out, how do you want bengong to be able to continue to live?\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking till the end, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes were moist again. Not waiting for people to understand, sparkling tears like flood poured out and raged down.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t know what to do facing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s tears. While carefully wiping her tears, his hostility skyrocketed: \u201cQing Qing, the humiliation you suffered today, benwang3 will definitely get it back for you on the battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Feng Cang is making this matter bigger and even mentioned battlefield, Longze Yu can no longer sit still and rushed to Longze Yu Er. Pa, pa. he mercilessly slapped her twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarn thing! How did I give birth to a thing like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er only saw stars in her eyes after the two slaps from Longze Yu. Although she is a daughter, but since little, she was doted by Longze Yu. Emperor father has never touched even a small finger of her. Today he slapped her in front of so many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fearing that Longze Yu Er will say more \u2018darn words\u2019, Longze Yu scolded her to let her shut up. Knowing that Longze Yu was really angry, Longze Yu Er bitterly endured the tears. She stood there with a red face without daring to move.</p><br/><p>After teaching his daughter a lesson, Longze Yu turned and smiled at Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi: \u201cNan Lin wang, all is a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi hears that, she cried even louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be because I\u2019m not a real princess and doesn\u2019t have a noble identity, that\u2019s why they are humiliating me like this. Wangye, it\u2019s said to hit the people but not hit the face. Everyone knows I\u2019m Nan Lin wangfei. They are like this. They obviously look down on you and looks down on Bei Zhou country!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a big hat being put on Longze Yu\u2019s head, making him uncomfortable, but he doesn\u2019t dare to take it off. In Longze Yu\u2019s heart, he really hates Murong Qi Qi. If he had known that she will be so difficult to deal with, he should have just find an easy woman to be the princess. Then he wouldn\u2019t have all these troubles.</p><br/><p>\u201cI being falsely accused is a small thing, but wangye is a real man, the Nan Lin wang who shook the four countries. How can wangye bear such humiliation?! Even if they don\u2019t give face to the monk, they should give face to the Buddha. How are they bullying me? They are completely bullying wangye, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>If one, crying, two, make a scene, three, hang herself are a woman\u2019s most powerful tricks, then Murong Qi Qi played the first one. Even Longze Yu felt like he doesn\u2019t have the tears to cry anymore. A big hat came down on Longze Yu\u2019s head and tightly fastened onto his head, making him feel that his head is becoming bigger and bigger. His heart is also more and more disturbed.</p><br/><p>Cry, 2. Make a scene, 3 hang herself: make a terrible scene, throw a tantrum</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small nose becoming red from crying, Feng Cang couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. He took Murong Qi Qi into his embrace, turned and wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, let\u2019s leave! Benwang will immediately write a letter to emperor uncle. His nephew\u2019s wife has suffered. Let\u2019s see if he does or doesn\u2019t help!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Longze Yu wanted to die.</p><br/><p>Who doesn\u2019t know that Bei Zhou\u2019s emperor Wanyan Lie is the most protective and that the one he loves the most is his treasured nephew? That\u2019s why when Feng Cang was ten years old, he bestowed him the title of wang. When he was fifteen years he let him have military power. Now there\u2019s even the thought of giving him the throne.</p><br/><p>If the matter of today get informed to Wanyan Lie with vinegar and oil, he will surely give Feng Cang the permission to use the troops in Xi Qi country. In history there are no small amount of cases where war began just because of a trivial matter!</p><br/><p>Adding vinegar and oil: exaggerating.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, stay behind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu quickly stopped Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Seeing Longze Yu in front of her, Murong Qi Qi \u2018shivered\u2019 and hid into Feng Cang\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, do they want to kill to silence,\u201d Murong Qi Qi asked sheepishly</p><br/><p>\u2018Pu\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Longze Yu almost vomited blood.</p><br/><p>What kill to silence? What does she mean? He just didn\u2019t want the matter to become more serious and only wanted to explain! How come when it reached Murong Qi Qi, it became kill to silence? Even if you give him ten galls, he will not dare to do something to Feng Cang in front of so many people!</p><br/><p>Wang/ wangye: prince of the first rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wangfei: main wife of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Benwang: I, used by a wangye</p><br/>\n</div>"}

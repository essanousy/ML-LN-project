It also made Su Mei and Su Yue almost collapse. Did water enter this woman\u2019s brain? She wanted to compare wealth with miss? Her brain really was cramped.</p><br/><p>After Fang Tong received the money, he let the servants carefully wrap the clothes and then handed it to the maid behind Yu Shi Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter crown princess wears this dress, crown princess would certainly shine and would shine above everyone in appearance!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made Yu Shi Shi happy. She pretended to walk to Murong Qi Qi and turned over the dress Murong Qi Qi was looking at, \u201cHow beautiful! Princess, do you want to buy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Murong Qi Qi shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have money!\u201d</p><br/><p>That Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t have money made Yu Shi Shi very happy. Alright, compared to being a man, her Wanyan Hong couldn\u2019t be compared to Feng Cang. But comparing money, she at least had a small treasury and was richer than Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, what I take a fancy on, wangye1 will buy for me. Wangye said that men spend money to buy a woman\u2019s happiness is a matter of course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Waiting till the smile on Yu Shi Shi was the biggest, did Murong Qi Qi threw out such a sentence, making Yu Shi Shi\u2019s smile stiffen. And Feng Cang also very cooperatively let Fang Tong pack the dress in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand. He paid ten thousand teals on spot.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, Feng Cang\u2019s attitude was a slap on Yu Shi Shi\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t know if she should laugh or cry on her stiff face. Did this woman do it on purpose?</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu seemed to have seen how favored Murong Qi Qi is. All kinds of envy, jealous and hate came into her heart. It was just, she also knew clearly, she couldn\u2019t win over Murong Qi Qi. She could only take her time to plan. The thing she needed to do now was to ruin Murong Qing Lian. Then she should paste herself on Longze Jing Tian, the big tree.</p><br/><p>When Murong Qi Qi returned to the wangfu2, Su Yue reported to her what Fang Tong found out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? So, it\u2019s her! That\u2019s why I said, why couldn\u2019t everyone in Moyu find her?! So, it was because she turned into Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi slowly blew the smoke floating above the tea. \u201cFind someone clever to follow her. Leave her life for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Su Yue nodded. Murong Qi Qi called her (SY) to her (MQQ) side. She whispered something in her ears. Su Yue retreated while smiling.</p><br/><p>The next day, a man in ragged clothes appeared outside the prime minister\u2019s mansion. In his hand, he held Mu Yu Die\u2019s jade pendant. He shouted he wanted to see Mu fu\u2019s3 eldest miss and wanted to marry her. The shouting of the man attracted many onlookers. Seeing that there were so many people, the man put more effort. He showed the onlookers the jade with the three words \u2018Mu Yu Die\u2019 engraved on it. He also vividly described how he and Mu fu\u2019s eldest miss got to know and fell in love with each other and how they privately already made a pledge to be married.</p><br/><p>When prime minister Mu Hua came back from the morning court meeting, the matter of the prime minister\u2019s eldest miss and a man had an affair had long caused an uproar. The whole capital knew about this matter by then.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisgraceful!\u201d Mu Hua called Mu Yu Die over. He didn\u2019t listen to her explanation. A slap went straight at her face. \u201cYou actually lose your jade pendant and it also fell into a man\u2019s hands! All of Mu family\u2019s face was lost because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die cried while explaining, but Mu Hua didn\u2019t listen. A girl\u2019s personal token, a symbol of identity fell onto a man\u2019s hands; even if they explain that Mu Yu Die was innocent, but those commoners won\u2019t think like that. Not to mention that he is a country\u2019s prime minister. How many pair of eyes are watching him and waiting for him to make a mistake? He had always been so cautious. He didn\u2019t expect that his granddaughter would let Mu fu lose such a big face.</p><br/><p>The moment, he thought about the man with Mu Yu Die\u2019s jade, Mu Hua wished he could kill him. However, that man was smart. He let everyone know about this. If something happened to him and his opponents get this piece of information to use against him, he would be in trouble. So, now, not only couldn\u2019t Mu Hua kill him, instead, he should protect him, lest to let him be killed and Mu fu be framed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsually, you\u2019re so clever, how come you\u2019re of no good now? A girl\u2019s reputation is ruined. See, how you\u2019ll face people in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, I don\u2019t want to marry that beggar! I don\u2019t want to marry him! I like Feng Cang. I want to marry Feng Cang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019 Hearing Mu Yu Die mention \u2018Feng Cang\u2019, Mu Hua got angry. He raised his hand. Another slap went to Mu Yu Die\u2019s face. \u201cHow come this old one has such a disappointing granddaughter? What\u2019s not good about second prince? When you marry, you\u2019ll be an imperial consort. In the future, you\u2019ll be empress. You happen to fancy a sickly person. Are you blind or have you gone mad? Now, such a thing happened and you still want to marry Feng Cang? Forget it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing that happened at the prime minister\u2019s mansion became the joke of the high society. And Mu Yu Die also became the talk and laughter at the dining table. There were people who rumored the story very brilliantly. They described the story of Mu Yu Die and the beggar very vividly and colorful like they witnessed it themselves.</p><br/><p>For a time, this profane love had been coated with a layer of legendary light. It even spread to Wanyan Lie\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? There\u2019s actually such a thing?\u201d Wanyan Lie heard about this incomparable love at empress Li Bing\u2019s. He was very interested. \u201cIn this world there\u2019s very small number of love where the families didn\u2019t match. Since it\u2019s like that, then zhen4 will grant them marriage!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a decree, Mu Yu Die became the bride of a beggar. Mu Hua was so angry that he fainted. It was just, no matter how much Mu Hua loved his granddaughter or how unwilling Mu Yu Die was, they couldn\u2019t defy the emperor\u2019s decree. When he got to know it was empress Li Bing who told the emperor this, Mu Hua hated the empress so much.</p><br/><p>The empress was like this was for nothing more but because Mu Hua stood at the second prince\u2019s side. That was why she humiliated Mu Yu Die and also humiliated prime minister Mu Hua. With tears, he let Mu Yu Die get married. Hearing his granddaughter\u2019s hysterical cries, Mu Hua cried. He would remember this! No matter what, he won\u2019t let Wanyan Hong become the emperor!</p><br/><p>When Su Mei told Murong Qi Qi Mu Yu Die\u2019s ending, she only smiled. Mu Yu Die asked for it herself. This punishment could be considered light. Time would wash away everything. Mu Yu Die\u2019s matter very quickly became history.</p><br/><p>These days, Murong Qi Qi was very idle. So idle, she almost became mold.</p><br/><p>The wangfu was decorated with lanterns and colored banners in preparation of Feng Cang\u2019s wedding. These past few days, Feng Cang appeared like gods and disappeared like devils. Wanyan Kang came by a few times. These two mixed and whispered together. They seemed to be keeping something from Murong Qi Qi. It was just, they were very secretive. Wanyan Kang even kept it from Su Mei. There was definitely something fishy going on.</p><br/><p>Appeared like gods and disappeared like devils: appear and disappear unpredictably.</p><br/><p>There was three days left before the wedding. This day, the wangfei5 was very quiet. When Murong Qi Qi woke up and opened her eyes, it was already noon. She discovered that Su Mei and Su Yue was not at her side. She called twice, but no one appeared. Murong Qi Qi could only get up and wash by herself. Because she didn\u2019t know how to do her hair, she let her long hair loose. It reached her heel. She dressed up and walked out of Tingsong Building.</p><br/><p>It was still the first month of the lunar calendar. The weather was still cold. Murong Qi Qi stepped on the snow while wandering in the wangfu. After walking for a while, she felt that something wasn\u2019t right. The whole wangfu was very quiet. No sound could be heard and also no people could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye? Su Mei! Su Yue!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so quiet and no one responded. Only occasionally, she could hear a sound or two from the birds. There were no other sounds.</p><br/><p>So strange\u2026Murong Qi Qi was very surprised. Where did all the people go? could it be that all went to prepare for the wedding? However, it still shouldn\u2019t be like this with not even one person around, ah!</p><br/><p>She walked around the whole wangfu but didn\u2019t see even one person. When Murong Qi Qi returned to Tingsong Building, it was already evening.</p><br/><p>In the winter, it would become dark earlier. Looking at the vast dusk, Murong Qi Qi felt a bit uneasy. What the matter? Why isn\u2019t anyone here? Could it be something happened? Or is it that someone invaded wangfu?</p><br/><p>Just as Murong Qi Qi was thinking, a sound of the zither came over. The sound was melodious like gurgling spring water. It was like you could become drunk from the sound. There\u2019s someone! Murong Qi Qi was happy. She immediately followed the sound of the zither to find the source. She didn\u2019t expect to go around the whole plum garden.</p><br/><p>It was in the winter. The plum blossoms bloomed alluringly. The moment Murong Qi Qi looked, she saw Feng Cang inside the pavilion in the plum garden.</p><br/><p>It seemed that today\u2019s Feng Cang was particularly handsome. He was still wearing snow white clothes. His long hair was in a bundle on the top of his head. At this time, Feng Cang was dedicated at playing the zither. His slender and long fingers fiddled the strings of the qin. A wonderful music came from those fingertips. The whole plum garden was surrounded by the touching zither\u2019s music.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, you came!\u201d After the final sound, Feng Cang stood up. Smilingly he led Murong Qi Qi into the pavilion. Don\u2019t know when, but two beautiful red candles on the table had been lit. What\u2019s more surprising was the jade bottle on the table where a bouquet of red plum was stuck inside.</p><br/><p>The orange candlelight rendered the whole atmosphere exceptionally warm. In the air floated a faint fragrance of plum. At this time, Feng Cang\u2019s eyes were particularly gentle, making Murong Qi Qi be suck into them.</p><br/><p>Could it be he wanted\u2026</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t get the situation yet, when Feng Cang knelt in front of her. In his hand was a beautiful box. When opened, inside the box lay a fine ruby ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi, are you willing to marry me and become my wife, accompany me in day and night, stand with me while holding hands, have children for me and after death\u2026be buried in our family\u2019s ancestral grave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi!\u201d Behind the rockery, don\u2019t know who laughed after hearing the last sentence.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t felt it was funny. At this time, her heart was filled with sweetness. After death, be buried in the ancestral grave of Feng clan? Leaving a tablet next to Feng Cang\u2019s in the ancestral hall of Feng clan? How wonderful was such a thing, ah?!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, are you willing? Are you willing to become my bride?\u201d Seeing that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t say a word for half a day, Feng Cang was anxious. In his handsome phoenix eyes appeared something called anxiety. \u201cAre you willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was somewhat worried that Murong Qi Qi wasn\u2019t willing.</p><br/><p>He prepared for so long was to give Murong Qi Qi the proposal of her dreams. However, he had never seen such a proposal and also had never heard about it. He had pondered these past two days for very long before choosing this place and appeared in such a way in front of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Now, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t nod for such a long time, made all those small sensitive and dejected feelings come out. If Murong Qi Qi doesn\u2019t agree or if she refuses, what should he do? He had never thought to force Murong Qi Qi to marry him. These past two days, the rumors were flying in the capital. Presumably, she also heard them. If she became timid before the marriage or if she wanted to retreat, what should he do?</p><br/><p>Only a dozen seconds, Feng Cang thought about many \u2018too horrible to contemplate\u2019 consequences. Aside from anxiousness in his eyes was also a trace of anticipation.</p><br/><p>When she saw the sincerity and melancholy in Feng Cang\u2019s eyes , Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart turned soft. This man, ah! He\u2019s obviously very manly, but now, he was so cautious making people feel pity!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I\u2019m willing!\u201d Murong Qi Qi raised her left hand in front of Feng Cang. \u201cI\u2019m willing to marry you to become your wife. From now till forever, whether it\u2019s during good or bad, rich or poor, healthy or sick, happiness or sadness, I will love you forever, cherish you and be faithful to you until forever after!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were surrounded by silence. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s gentle voice healed the fear in Feng Cang\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The moment he heard she was willing to marry him and would never leave him no matter when, where or what for situations, Feng Cang\u2019s excited lips slightly trembled. He stood up and tightly hugged Murong Qi Qi. He wished he could rub her into his bone marrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also love you! I\u2019m also willing to accompany for a very long time. No matter if it\u2019s during favorable circumstances or predicament, rich or poor, healthy or sick, happiness or sadness, I will love you forever, cherish you, respect you and be faithful to you for all eternity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang remembered Murong Qi Qi\u2019s promise. He tightly hugged Murong Qi Qi while his heart beat fast. So many years, so many days, Feng Cang had never been happy like today!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that Murong Qi Qi is his bride, but this marriage was set by the two countries. It was not her own will.</p><br/><p>All along, Feng Cang had a trace of worry. He was worried that Murong Qi Qi was forced to marry him. Now, hearing Murong Qi Qi say \u2018I\u2019m willing\u2019, \u2018I\u2019ll love you forever\u2019, Feng Can\u2019s heart completely opened. His heart also completely relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Next to them, someone clapped and someone cheered. When Murong Qi Qi left Feng Cang\u2019s arms, she discovered that the people who disappeared during the day were now surrounding them. Everyone was cheering this couple. Wanyan Kang shouted the loudest!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi suddenly realized. Everything which happened today was the \u2018collusion\u2019 of these people.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, miss! Congratulations, guye6!\u201d Su Mei and Su Yue smilingly went forward and bowed at Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang. The \u2018guye\u2019 from the two made Feng Cang\u2019s mood soar. He rewarded everyone with a salary of a year.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, the ring isn\u2019t put on yet!\u201d Murong Qi Qi waved her left hand. \u201cYou need to put it on the ring finger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good!\u201d Feng Cang was too happy. He actually had forgotten the most critical thing. When he put the ring on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ring finger, the two\u2019s fingers intertwined as if they would never separate.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiss her!\u201d Wanyan Kang shouted. With this fifth prince taking the lead, the others also shouted.</p><br/><p>Normally, these servants were a bit afraid of Feng Cang. However, today was Feng Cang\u2019s happiest day. He smiled a lot more. He seemed a lot easier to get close to. So, under the lead of Wanyan Kang, everyone also shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother, kiss her! Come, kiss as a pledge to your love! What do you guys say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices of the masses were loud and clear. Their eyes bright as snow. Under the eyes of so many, Feng Cang slowly lowered his head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Looking at the bright and dazzling woman in front of them, the people in black couldn\u2019t help but envy their master\u2019s good fortune form the bottom of their hearts. Originally, they were worried that because of this matter, Feng Cang would suffer at mistress\u2019s hands. They didn\u2019t expect that this laughter from mistress, would let the earth become pale in comparison.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s handsome face was somewhat hot. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s attitude was too beyond his imaginations. Just as Feng Cang still wasn\u2019t sure if Murong Qi Qi truly wasn\u2019t angry, the other party came with cat\u2019s steps and jumped into Feng Cang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou care about me, I am very happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi lay in Feng Cang\u2019s arms. She raised her head and looked in his eyes, \u201cReally! You care so much about me, I\u2019m particularly moved!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, those people who prayed for Feng Cang were completely assured.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Someone clapped. More people cheered for Feng Cang and were happy because he found such a reasonable person.</p><br/><p>The laughter was strong in these people in black who were utterly defeated by Murong Qi Qi. Naturally, they wished for their master to be happy. To be able to find such an intimate and such a powerful mistress was something everyone looked for a very long time forward to.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, you don\u2019t blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFool!\u201d In order to reassure this person, in front of everyone, Murong Qi Qi tiptoed, her hands went around Feng Cang\u2019s neck and sent him a warm kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress is formidable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a hot scene let those men scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d This kiss let Feng Cang\u2019s heart eased down completely. She\u2019s his. He felt it! \u201cQing Qing, I love you!\u201d Feng Cang lowered his head and kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare to see such a wonderful picture. Everyone polished their eyes and stared at that pair of lovers; one in red, one in white. They kissed like the world was shaking as if in this world, there were only the two of them\u2026</p><br/><p>Kissing to the end, Feng Cang lowered his body and picked Murong Qi Qi up. He left as fast as the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026,\u201d Su Yue was just about to follow, when she was stopped by Nalan Xin. \u201cWangye 1 and wangfei2 have something to do. We shouldn\u2019t bother them! The most important thing now is to check how Wu Ji Gong\u2019s people hooked on the people from the court. The matter of Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai still needs to be resolved. For an estimate short time, master wouldn\u2019t have time to care about this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin saying this, Su Yue\u2019s face turned red. Looking at the situation, miss and guye3 must\u2019ve gone to a world with only the two of them. Su Mei also had a red face. Instead it was Fang Tong who laughed. \u201cIt seemed that we should prepare sooner. Firstly, resolve these trivial matters. Then, we must prepare for the arrival of young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin felt that he was subtle enough. He didn\u2019t expect that Fang Tong, this elder, would be so direct. The couple just went to be affectionate and this elder directly thought about the next generation.</p><br/><p>The thought that he kidnapped Fang Tong to here today, Nalan Xin quickly came forward to apologize, \u201cElder Fang, this younger one lacked manners today. Asking elder to let this younger one atone for my crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Fang Tong laughed and waved his hand. Before, he also misunderstood Feng Cang. Only after he encountered Su Mei and Su Yue, did he understand the matter. Seeing Feng Cang cared so much for Murong Qi Qi, of course, Fang Tong was happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere would always be talented people coming out of this world. Brat, you\u2019re not bad! Your martial arts are great, ah! Today we\u2019re surging waters flooded the Dragon King Temple, our own people didn\u2019t recognize our own people. Now the contradictions are untied. It\u2019s nothing!\u201d While talking, Fang Tong\u2019s big hand patted on Nalan Xin\u2019s shoulder. It could be regarded as his (FT) affirmation towards him (NX)</p><br/><p>Surging waters flooded the Dragon King Temple: a dispute between close people who fail to recognize each other</p><br/><p>Fang Tong saying this made Nalan Xin felt that Moyu\u2019s people were very interesting. People of the jianghu 4 didn\u2019t bother about trifles.</p><br/><p>Although Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi weren\u2019t here, but Nalan Xin and Fang Tong\u2019s point of view was the same on the matter of dealing with Wu Ji Gong.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Fang, you see, this was our fault. Why don\u2019t you let us deal with Wu Ji Gong\u2019s matter? It could be considered as an apology to wangfei and also an explanation for Moyu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong nodded at Nalan Xin\u2019s opinion, \u201cOriginally, this matter should be decided by miss. Now, since young master Nalan said it like this, then do according to your wishes! Elder, me, had long seen Wu Ji Gong as a thorn in the eyes. In my opinion, it\u2019s the best to wipe them out at once! Lest to let them come disturb and let miss and guye worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>What Fang Tong said was what Nalan Xin thought about. Although, he didn\u2019t know why Wu Ji Gong would make trouble for Guanghua gongzi,5 but they even pulled the army in. Then it would have something to do with the court.</p><br/><p>Wu Ji Gong had always been the running dogs of the crown prince. Maybe this matter had something to do with the crown prince. Anyway, regardless of the consequences, destroy them first.</p><br/><p>He had long not liked Wanyan Hong! Free or not free, he (WH) would bother wangye. This time, he even burned wangfei\u2019s Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai. It\u2019s said, what can\u2019t be tolerated shouldn\u2019t be tolerated! Offending wangye is a small matter. Causing him (NX) to leave a bad impression at wangfei\u2019s was something that even heaven\u2019s law wouldn\u2019t tolerate!</p><br/><p>At this end, Nalan Xin was planning how to end Wu Ji Gong. At the other side of Lion Ridge, Feng Cang grabbed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s chin and deeply looked at the little woman in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I was bitterly being kept in the dark by you\u2026\u201dA long sigh evaporated all the vinegar of Feng Cang from these past few days, leaving only a thick love and a slight blame.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Besides, you also kept a secret from me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Feng Cang to speak, Murong Qi Qi seized Feng Cang\u2019s hand. She turned and sat in a riding position on Feng Cang\u2019s body, \u201cCang\u2026\u201d Learning from Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi also grabbed Feng Cang\u2019s chin. Her fingertips gently touched Feng Cang\u2019s thin beard stubble. Her eyes were smiling, but they had a temptation in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang has something you hid from me\u2026You kept talking about my wrongdoings. Why did you have questions and didn\u2019t come ask me directly? I kept it from you, then why weren\u2019t you forthcoming with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s questions made Feng Cang laugh helplessly. Just now, he was thinking that Murong Qi Qi wouldn\u2019t hold someone accountable for today\u2019s matter. In front of everyone, she took the initiative to kiss him and gave him enough face. Feng Cang thought that today\u2019s matter vanished with that affectionate kiss.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s move was here. She was waiting to settle the scores at an opportune moment and to send punitive forces against him in private. This little woman knew very well that men wanted face\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, who are you? Seeing your position, I think you\u2019re not so simple as being only Nan Lin wang!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Murong Qi Qi was speaking, her fingertips made circles on Feng Cang\u2019s chin. It was as if her hands had magic. Where they touched, they bought Feng Cang a numb feeling. From his chin, that feeling extended and finally conveyed to his whole body.</p><br/><p>Could it be that this woman didn\u2019t know what she was doing?! Feng Cang swallowed. Her hand lit him like fire, making his heart and his body began to stir.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang grasped Murong Qi Qi\u2019s restless hand. His eyes were exceptionally brightly lit under the candle, \u201cQing Qing, talking about it, our fate wasn\u2019t shallow. I\u2019m the leader of Fo Sheng Men\u2026Long Ao Tian!\u201d</p><br/><p>The story began five years ago, when Feng Cang\u2019s poison acted and met Mozun. She heard that godfather promised her to Feng Cang. Murong Qi Qi laughed and put her arms on Feng Cang\u2019s waist. \u201cSo, our fate was destined! Father and mother wanted to promise me to you. Godfather also took a fancy on you. Now, even I, the involved party was also made so infatuated with you. A predestined marriage concluded by three fates.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Feng Cang happy. A predestined marriage concluded by three fates? This was well said! Their fate was actually already firmly tied together from a long time ago. It seemed that this small lazy cate was destined to be his!</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, how would you compensate me for today\u2019s matter?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi crossed her arms over her chest and pretended to look angrily at Feng Cang, \u201cWe fought internally, let people think we\u2019re a joke and also let those bastard from Wu Ji Gong find a loophole; destroying my efforts. You say, how should you compensate me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi kept repeating \u2018compensation\u2019 made Feng Cang think about Wu Ji Gong that participated in this matter. Usually, he turned a blind eye. This time, Wu Ji Gong actually wanted to touch his woman? This matter absolutely couldn\u2019t be forgiven!</p><br/><p>\u201cServants!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s voice echoed. A person in black appeared in front of them, \u201cMaster!\u201d The person in black knelt on one knee. His whole body revealed his respect towards Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDestroy Wu Ji Gong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The person in black was about to leave, but was stopped by Murong Qi Qi, \u201cTake my people. Take Su Yue. Tell her that Wu Ji Gong destroyed my things. Even if skinning their skin, they need to compensate my loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in black didn\u2019t move. He just looked at Feng Cang. Feng Cang is his master. This matter needed master\u2019s nod.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo! Let Nalan Xin take care of this matter and convey wangfei\u2019s words! Tell Nalan Xin to take care of this beautifully as to make up for his earlier mistake!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Nalan Xin heard the meaning Feng Cang let the person in black convey, he was completely speechless. What kind of black-bellied master is this, ah?! He (FC) did the wrong thing himself and now he let him (NX) who only run the errands go \u2018make up for his earlier mistake\u2019! Wanting to make wangfei happy, no need to single him out as the point of attack, ah!</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin felt like weeping, but had no tears. This was Feng Cang\u2019s command. He could only successfully complete it.</p><br/><p>Where would Feng Cang have the time to care about Nalan Xin\u2019s thoughts now. He repeatedly said \u2018Qing Qing\u2019 to coax Murong Qi Qi into happiness.</p><br/><p>It was said that women needed to be coaxed. Feng Cang admitted that he was indeed wrong on this matter. If he had listened to Nalan Xin sooner and talked frankly with Murong Qi Qi, this misunderstanding wouldn\u2019t have continued for so long. He also wouldn\u2019t lose his reason and eat vinegar for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, look, you already beat and kicked. Now, my chest is still hurting! If you don\u2019t believe me, then touch!\u201d Feng Cang grabbed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small hand and put it on his heart, \u201cToday I finally got to know that Qing Qing\u2019s usual gentleness and pleasantness were all a pretense. It turned out that when Qing Qing flipped out, Qing Qing would be so violent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after Feng Cang said this, did Murong Qi Qi remember. Before, she flew into a rage out of humiliation. Not only did she give him a slap but also fiercely kicked Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t know it was you! Are you alright?! Does it hurt? Let me take a look!\u201d Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t think much and directly pried the clothes on Feng Cang\u2019s chest open. Sure enough, on his white like jade skin was a red footprint.</p><br/><p>Seeing this shoeprint, Murong Qi Qi blushed. She had forgotten how powerful her flying kick was. Especially at that time, Feng Cang already let his guard down. This kick certainly hurt him.</p><br/><p>The red footprint on Feng Cang\u2019s milk white skin was especially offending to the eyes as if it was complaining about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s barbarian ways. After seeing her achievement, the original right and self-confident Murong Qi Qi became sickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you to have nothing to do and lowered your voice. I couldn\u2019t recognize your voice. I saw you in white clothes and in disarray like a cow, I got angry. Besides, you kept touching, I thought I encountered a pervert\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The more she talked, the smaller Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice became. She searched on her body, wanting to find a cream for Feng Cang to lessen the swelling. After searching for half day, did Murong Qi Qi remember that she changed just now. She didn\u2019t bring those creams. Looking at the redness on Feng Cang\u2019s chest, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face became redder.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we go back! My creams are at wangfu. I assure you, as long as you apply my creams, it wouldn\u2019t even take a half day before the redness and swelling would be eliminated. After a day, it wouldn\u2019t hurt anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi wanted to get up, but had been locked in Feng Cang\u2019s arms, \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s face was slightly red. When this little woman examined his \u2018injury\u2019, Feng Cang had an unprecedented impulse of wanting to jump on Murong Qi Qi and punish her on spot.</p><br/><p>Could this woman not know that she, a sheep, to him, this wolf, was a delicacy?! She pried his clothes open. Did she not understand that to a man that was undoubtedly a very great temptation?</p><br/><p>\u201cCang? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seeing Feng Cang being so red, Murong Qi Qi reached out her hand and waved in front of his eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Does it hurt very much? I\u2019m sorry! I really didn\u2019t know it was you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes were full of guilt, but Feng Cang was \u2018unwilling to forgive\u2019. \u201cQing Qing really has a ruthless heart! Obviously, you want to murder your husband! You definitely have someone else in your heart. So, you want to take my life and elope with another\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t!\u201d Hearing Feng Cang say this, Murong Qi Qi immediately shook her head. \u201cI really didn\u2019t do it on purpose! I didn\u2019t recognize you! I don\u2019t like someone else aside from you touching me. That was why, that kick was so fierce!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that \u2018I don\u2019t like someone else touching me\u2019, Feng Cang\u2019s beautiful eyes filled with laughter. So, it was like that! She took herself as his private ownership. That was why she would be like that. She was protecting him, ah!</p><br/><p>However, although, he was touched, Feng Cang didn\u2019t plan on \u2018letting\u2019 Murong Qi Qi \u2018off the hook\u2019. Finally, he caught the opportunity to eat the lamb. How would he give up on the delicacy presented to his mouth?!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Feng Cang frowned and clutched his heart. He pretended to be in much pain and began to moan, \u201cJust now, we didn\u2019t talk about it and I didn\u2019t feel it. Now, here really hurt! Qing Qing, my chest hurts very much. You say, am I dying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Feng Cang saying this, Murong Qi Qi became anxious. She immediately put her hand on Feng Cang\u2019s wrist to check his pulse. After not finding anything strange, Murong Qi Qi was relieved. She was just about to speak, when Feng Cang\u2019s voice with a hidden bitterness came over, \u201cBut, my chest hurt so much. What to do? Why don\u2019t you blow on it for me. It won\u2019t hurt anymore if you blow on it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlow\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi froze there. Where did this principle come from? After being wounded, \u2018blow\u2019 on it and it would be fine?</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi had doubts, Feng Cang pretended to grimace in pain, \u201cQing Qing, it really hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll blow on it for you!\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small face came to Feng Cang\u2019s chest. Her small mouth opened slightly and blew out a warm heat. That warm air lingered for a long time on Feng Cang\u2019s chest. It didn\u2019t dissipate yet, when the next warm air hit again.</p><br/><p>An electric shock spread from Feng Cang\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had her head lowered and blew on Feng Cang\u2019s chest. Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s serious expression, Feng Cang suddenly had a sense of guilt. He felt like he was a big bad wolf deceiving a small lamb. However, this small lamb was so fresh and delicious, making him couldn\u2019t wait to get a taste. What should he do?</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang didn\u2019t realize that his original magnetic voice had become a bit hoarse. His throat was dry and his voice was somewhat trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d Murong Qi Qi raised her head. A pair of moist eyes was very thorough and with some anxiousness. This kick kicked Feng Cang\u2019s chest, but hurt Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart. Feng Cang\u2019s body was originally not so well; this kick was too powerful!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, if you kiss it, perhaps it won\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Feng Cang wished he could give himself two slaps. Shameless, ah! Too shameless! Shouldn\u2019t abduct a small sheep like this! Wasn\u2019t this committing a crime?! Since when did he become like a rogue? Really somewhat unscrupulous!</p><br/><p>The Murong Qi Qi who felt for Feng Cang didn\u2019t notice the strangeness in Feng Cang. Instead, she truly put her lips on the red print.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoo\u2026\u201d Feng Cang closed his eyes. This time, he knew he was wrong! He didn\u2019t know that to him, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s kiss was a fatal torture!</p><br/><p>Did this woman not doubt his ulterior motives? Her soft lips were on his chest and slowly moved around the injury. Without a doubt, this was a test to him; a torture! Just now, it was only a numb feeling. Now, Feng Cang\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but tremble slightly. Damn it! If he had known sooner, he wouldn\u2019t trick the small lamb. Now, the one who was feeling the most painful became him\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, what\u2019s the matter?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi soon discovered Feng Cang\u2019s strangeness. \u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d Murong Qi Qi put her hand on Feng Cang\u2019s forehead. \u201cThis won\u2019t do. We need to return to the wangfu!6 I certainly wounded you!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a saying, concern would cause chaos. Murong Qi Qi had high medical skills. Originally, with one look, she could see the trickery inside this. However, now her heart was full of guilt and ignored Feng Cang\u2019s gaze full of sexual desire.</p><br/><p>\u201cServants!\u201d Murong Qi Qi stood up, but had been grasped by Feng Cang. He pressed her under his body.</p><br/><p>1. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Wangfei: main consort/wife of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>3. Guye: son-in-law, used by the servants of the female family</p><br/><p>4. Jianghu: world of martial arts</p><br/><p>5. Gongzi: young master </p><br/><p>6.

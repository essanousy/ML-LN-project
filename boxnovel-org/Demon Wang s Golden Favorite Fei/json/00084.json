She immediately went forward and helped Wanyan Bao Zhu up.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, is everything alright? Princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Wanyan Bao Zhu shook her head. She turned her face to one side to let no one see her. Tears fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYong er, escort me back. It\u2019s very frightening here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi, the person standing next to Feng Cang; from the moment she had arrived, she had been focusing on Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s demeanor. Seeing her like this, she became even more sure that this person was not princess Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this person had an unusual relationship with Zhao Lang. Since she\u2019s Zhao Lang\u2019s person, then she\u2019s certainly also Wanyan Hong\u2019s person. If it\u2019s like that, she needed to let people watch over \u2018Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019. She would like to see what kind of purpose this person had to disguise themselves as the princess.</p><br/><p>Under the escort of Yong er, Wanyan Bao Zhu went back, step by step. When passing Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qi Qi suddenly asked: \u201cPrincess is feeling unwell? Do we need to invite a doctor over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu lowered her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen princess should rest well and nurse your body back to health. After two days, it\u2019s the tournament of the four countries. Bengong\u2019s2 happy future is relying on princess\u2019 force!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice had a happy taste, making Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart shook even more.</p><br/><p>Why, why is god so unfair? Seeing Feng Cang\u2019s careful appearance while hugging Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s hatred intensified. Why was her happiness deprived repeatedly and Murong Qi Qi had such a good life?! She doesn\u2019t accept! She doesn\u2019t accept that!</p><br/><p>It so happened, when Wanyan Bao Zhu raised her head, her eyes and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes intertwined. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s gaze was full of provocation and her mouth had a sarcastic smile. It was just like in Xi Qi; she\u2019s high above others, very arrogant!</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because Feng Cang was at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side; if it wasn\u2019t because Zhao Lang had died and she needed to take revenge for Zhao Lang, Wanyan Bao Zhu would\u2019ve rushed forward and tore that \u2018hateful\u2019 face of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>The hatred in Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s eyes, made Murong Qi Qi somewhat puzzled. This kind of hate made her feel somewhat baffled! The matter of last night was done in secret. Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t have known that it\u2019s her who did it, so why did she(WBZ) have that kind of hate when looking at her (MQQ)? Why did that hate seemed to have been there for quite a long time?</p><br/><p>Calm down, calm down! Wanyan Bao Zhu tried hard to convince herself. Don\u2019t get angry. Today, let that bitch Murong Qi Qi be happy. She would certainly find an opportunity and give Murong Qi Qi a deadly blow. By then, she\u2019d see if she (MQQ) would still able to laugh out loud!</p><br/><p>Zhao Lang\u2019s head, to the missionaries of Bei Zhou, was but a small wave of a river. They somersaulted for a bit and then disappeared. Aside from Wanyan Bao Zhu, no one would be sad because of this person and they also wouldn\u2019t care about this person\u2019s identity. In the end, Feng Cang let people send this head without an ear away to the outside of the city and casually find a place to throw it in the wilderness.</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Bao Zhu found out about how Feng Cang dealt with Zhao Lang\u2019s head, she also hated Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>If before, Wanyan Bao Zhu only lived to take revenge on Murong Qi Qi; now, she felt the burden on her was heavier. Not only did she need to stay alive, she also needed to use the identity Zhao Lang created for her and live very well. She needed to get revenge for Zhao Lang. She also need to let Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, this pair of animals, not live well!</p><br/><p>Now, she\u2019s not Murong Xin Lian who needed to hide from assassins. She\u2019s Wanyan Bao Zhu, the princess of Bei Zhou! She had an identity that can match with Murong Qi Qi and doesn\u2019t have to fear anyone any longer. She doesn\u2019t need to bow to anyone any longer! She needed to use the knife in her hand and personally cut off Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heads to take revenge for Zhao Lang!</p><br/><p>It was now the middle of December. The weather was getting increasingly cold, but Yongzhou city was particularly lively. All the missionaries of the other three countries have arrived. The tournament of the four countries were in sight. Plus, with the new year coming, the smell of the new year got increasingly strong in Yongzhou and it became more and more lively.</p><br/><p>From the beginning to the end, the tournament would only take ten days. The people of Dong Lu arrived the latest. The moment they came, they began to prepare the knockout competition. This time, Dong Lu would decide the content of the knockout competition. The knockout competition became somewhat a secret. It\u2019s just that the area outside the venue for the knockout competition was already being filled by people. No one was able to see what\u2019s happening inside. It made people look forward to the beginning of the competition even more.</p><br/><p>The citizens of Yongzhou discussed heavily about the tournament of the four countries. The bet between Xi Qi\u2019s princess Zhao Yang and Bei Zhou\u2019s empress dowager had long been spread throughout the north and south, not to mention Yongzhou, where the tournament would be held.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Zhao Yang? Murong Qi Qi? Rubbish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan sat at a chair against the window in the most prosperous and most lively \u2018Cyclamen\u2019. He watched the sky that was filled with snow and sipped wine.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t explained what Cyclamen is, but I think it\u2019s the name of a restaurant in Yongzhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly found this much information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir Jia Lan. Everything about Murong Qi Qi is in your hands without missing anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>At one side, a man in blue stood respectfully. The tone and posture showed his respect to the man in front of him.</p><br/><p>Jia Lan already read this information carefully from start to finish. From this information, he couldn\u2019t see anything special about Murong Qi Qi. However, the woman who could move that man, would she be mediocre?</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, she arrived\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan noticed that the whole Cyclamen had become silent. The reason for the quietness was the couple who had appeared at the door.</p><br/><p>The man was in a white fox fur. The white color made his face become more devilishly beautiful. The woman was wearing a red fox fur. Both the inside and outside was bright red, revealing a hot taste.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nan Lin wang3 and princess Zhao Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were some who were sharp-eyed and recognized this couple. Immediately, the audience was in uproar. Nan Lin wang! It\u2019s actually Nan Lin wang Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>Although many citizens have heard about the name Nan Lin wang and also knew that he\u2019s a man as beautiful as the devil, but for many people, this was the first time they saw Feng Cang in person. Immediately, someone screamed and there were more people who lost their breath.</p><br/><p>Devilish beauty, really a devilish beauty! Tempting like a devil phoenix eyes, red lips, black as ink pupils and with a faint smile. Looking at him, he seemed amiable, but also let people stay a thousand miles away. All the people here, there\u2019s no one who haven\u2019t heard about Nan Lin wang\u2019s reputation. Now seeing the real person, many people felt that those rumors were false. How could mere words describe this man?!</p><br/><p>Looking at the woman next to Feng Cang; compared to him, she seemed a lot plainer. Appearance was just ordinary. Although well-behaved and pleasant, but with such a devilish beauty at her side, she seemed more ordinary.</p><br/><p>Really, unfortunate\u2026\u2026the man\u2019s appearance was like the sky of tomorrow, the woman\u2019s like a grass at the roadside. This Murong Qi Qi was really not worthy of Nan Lin wang, everyone thought.</p><br/><p>However, the thoughts of everyone were only their wishful thinking. When seeing Feng Cang\u2019s attitude towards Murong Qi Qi, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, do you like it quiet or lively? Should we go to the rooms upstairs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang persistently held onto Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small hands and led her into the Cyclamen.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter! Instead of enjoying the happiness alone, why don\u2019t we share it and have fun with the citizens!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi wanted it to be lively, Feng Cang took her hand and led her to a vacant place.</p><br/><p>Here was the first floor. Everyone sitting here were all commoners. The famous Feng Cang sitting with Murong Qi Qi among commoners, made these people feel somewhat flattered. Looks like this wangye is very approachable, ah!</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t know that his little act for getting Murong Qi Qi to sit on the first floor, had let the people put the title of \u2018close to the commoners\u2019 on him.</p><br/><p>Nan Lin wang was here. The owner of Cyclamen personally came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust bring out a few special dishes. Not too much. Enough for two people is alright. If it\u2019s more, it\u2019ll be a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of Feng Cang\u2019s arrival, the whole Cyclamen was silent. Now, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words had clearly spread to everyone\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>The people who were regretting for Murong Qi Qi about her looks and felt that she wasn\u2019t worthy of Feng Cang; seeing princess Zhao Yang being so frugal, they all gave her a thumbs up. Originally, they thought that Murong Qi Qi would be very extravagant and wasteful. She would get a table full of dishes, eat a few and then feed the leftovers to dogs. They didn\u2019t expect that she would only order a few specialties.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the public opinion, which had fell down because of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ordinary looks, soared. A \u2018close to commoners\u2019 wangye and a thrifty princess, they are a perfect match!</p><br/><p>The owner was naturally very considerate. He pulled out five dishes. A bowl of bear\u2019s paw, supreme prawn, dried shark\u2019s fin, crystal meat, plus a dish that everyone in Bei Zhou loved to eat, water Chinese cabbage.</p><br/><p>crystal meat</p><br/><p>dried shark fin</p><br/><p>bear\u2019s paw</p><br/><p>supreme shrimps</p><br/><p>water Chinese cabbage</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang peeled a shrimp and put it in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s bowl.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi picked it up and put it in her mouth. She savored it and slowly chewed. Her way of eating was very elegant, making everyone put down their chopsticks and stare at this princess. Even the owner stood at one side with a bent back. On his forehead was a layer of cold sweat as he waited for Murong Qi Qi\u2019s evaluation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDelicious! Cyclamen really deserves its reputation!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice fell, the owner let out a breath of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking princess for the praise! Thanks princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo do your work! You don\u2019t need to serve here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang gestured with his hand. The owner bowed and then left, leaving Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi alone. Feng Cang didn\u2019t eat much. He was carefully putting dishes on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s bowl. His gentleness and carefulness made people couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. The demon wang from the rumors wasn\u2019t like this. Could it be that the rumors were wrong?</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang\u2019s carefulness and gentleness, the commoners felt more assured that the rumors about demon wang were false.</p><br/><p>What bloodthirsty? What cruelty? That gentle man, who was tenderly peeling shrimps next to that woman, would be such a vicious and cruel man?</p><br/><p>No one could link such a Feng Cang with the demon wang from the rumors. More people realized that those rumors must have been spread by people who were jealous of Feng Cang\u2019s talent. That\u2019s why they released those incredible words with the purpose of slandering him! Immediately, the public opinion soared like a river; all flowing to Feng Cang\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>On the second floor, from the moment Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang arrived, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s eyes were stuck on Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know why, he didn\u2019t see Murong Qi Qi for just a period, but he felt like it was a very long time. She had changed, had become more feminine. That delicate and well-behaved appearance made people couldn\u2019t help but cherish her from the bottom of their heart.</p><br/><p>The one who traveled together with him, Murong Qing Lian, was in the same mood as him. Only her goal was Feng Cang. Before in Xi Qi, she saw Feng Cang once and had been enthralled by his handsomeness. Now, her heart only beat for this gentle man. Murong Qing Lian never expected that Feng Cang would treat people so kindly and was so good to women. Seeing that stunning man next to Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qing Lian wished that she was sitting in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s place and enjoying those benefits.</p><br/><p>This time, Xi Qi was led by Longze Jing Tian. Beside Murong Qing Lian, the other members were Li Yun Qing and Bai Yi Yue; two women and two men.</p><br/><p>Before, because the imperial family of Xi Qi had lost two princes and one princess at the Chongyan Festival\u2019s palace banquet; plus the fact that Murong Xue Lian, because of a miscarriage, didn\u2019t recover and stayed all the time in bed, Longze Yu\u2019s mood was extremely bad. He threw the tournament of the four countries to Longze Jing Tian and let him take care of it. So, the participants were decided by Longze Jing Tian. Using his words: not much but strong.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue saw Murong Qi Qi was happy; naturally, she\u2019s also happy for her. And Li Yun Qing\u2019s mood was very depressed. The originally handsome man was now very quiet. He only looked quietly at Murong Qi Qi as if wanting to imprint her face into his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, I want to go over and greet princess Zhao Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue stood up and consulted Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also heard the matter about princess Zhao Yang. Why don\u2019t we all go to see her? After all, she\u2019s our Xi Qi\u2019s princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian led the group of people to Feng Cang\u2019s and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s table. He first paid his respects to Feng Cang. Then Longze Jing Tian looked at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, long time no see!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi nodded at Longze Jing Tian. She didn\u2019t have any interest in Longze Jing Tian; instead, she stood up when she saw Li Yun Qing and Bai Yi Yue. She stepped forward and pulled Bai Yi Yue\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Yue, you also came! Cousin brother, long time no see!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi truly saw these two as friends. No matter if it\u2019s Li Yun Qing, who had helped her or Bai Yi Yue, who had always treated her as friend; to be able to see them in a foreign country made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mood very good.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess is blessed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue smiled and looked at Murong Qi Qi and then looked at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess looks very good. It seems that princess is already accustomed to Bei Zhou and is living happily there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi blushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye is very good to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue felt happy for Murong Qi Qi from the bottom of her heart.</p><br/><p>And this sentence of Murong Qi Qi made these people get a strange taste. Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart was full of bitterness. Why, why does he feel regret after missing it? Why did she say goodbye to him when he had just deviated a little bit?</p><br/><p>In contrast to Longze Jing Tian, Li Yun Qing calmed down. Before, when he didn\u2019t see Murong Qi Qi, his whole heart was hanging; worried that she was not living well, worried that Feng Cang bullied her. Now, seeing Murong Qi Qi happy, he felt relieved. That she is happy, to him is the best news.</p><br/><p>The one who was the most dissatisfied was Murong Qing Lian.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s happy smile was like a thorn in Murong Qing Lian\u2019s heart. She wished she could get rid of her. She\u2019s just a rubbish. What ability did she have to get Feng Cang\u2019s favor? To have such an outstanding man at her knees, what kind of dog feces did Murong Qi Qi step on to get such luck?</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qing Lian to understand the reason, someone already asked out loud what was in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, very strange! Did the sun come out from the west? Always it\u2019s been flowers stuck into cow dung, why is it reversed today, ah?! Obviously, he\u2019s an unparalleled man, why is such an ugly woman following him. Is it the man who has a poor taste or is it the woman who\u2019s shameless, ah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Flowers stuck into cow dung: lovely woman marries an odious man</p><br/><p>The words just fell, when a group of people came down from the second floor and appeared in front of everyone. The one leading was a beautiful woman wearing a burning red robe, abundant with a body full of jewels.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuli, what you said is wrong! Without ugly, how could beauty be brought out?! It\u2019s like without evil; how could it be compared to good?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one talking was a man. His skin was white. He only had a male voice, completely destroying his image. This man looked too feminine. His waist was slimmer than a woman\u2019s. His eyes only stayed a bit on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face and then stopped at Feng Cang\u2019s body. That gaze was full of possessiveness as if Feng Cang was a delicious dinner, tempting people to taste it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Duo, don\u2019t fight with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing Long Duo\u2019s mind, Guli stopped him with her foot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI took a fancy to this man. He\u2019s mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The white face laughed and revealed a row of yellow teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuli, beauty, everyone loves him. If you have the ability to snatch him, I\u2019ll admit defeat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Long Duo to finish, Guli shook and twisted to Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>This woman had a smile which was able to let people lose their souls. Her eyes constantly sent electricity to Feng Cang. This man, whose whole body exuded cold aura, was really to her taste. Traveling all over the four countries, sleeping with so many man, she had never encountered such a man who let her heart be moved, who let her couldn\u2019t wait to threw herself at him.</p><br/><p>Guli\u2019s eyes were like a scanner, sweeping over Feng Cang\u2019s whole body repeatedly. Not bad. The shoulder was wide and skinny enough. The waist was slender and narrow enough. With one look, you would know that this was a man with strength. If being able to have pleasure between fish and water with such a man, it\u2019s simply the world\u2019s most beautiful thing.</p><br/><p>Pleasure between fish and water: sexual intercourse (TN: I really don\u2019t know how ancient Chinese people came up with these idioms)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Nan Lin wang Feng Cang? I\u2019m Nan Feng\u2019s contestant. My name is Guli. This year, I\u2019m seventeen and don\u2019t have a marriage arrangement yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she was in front of Feng Cang, she tilted her legs, sat next to him and enthusiastically introduced herself.</p><br/><p>What made everyone surprised was, inside Guli\u2019s red robe, there were two beautiful legs. Her skin color was a healthy wheat color. So, the exposed legs, although slender, but they were also strong. They were also a healthy wheat color. And her upper body, everyone discovered that this woman\u2019s collar was open till her chest. Those two wheat-colored clouds squeezed as if they wanted to sprung out of the red barrier, very eye catching.</p><br/><p>This, they are an E-cup, right?! Murong Qi Qi visually measured a bit. Really a big milk cow, ah! Thinking about herself, she\u2019s just B. Suddenly, Murong Qi Qi felt regret. Although B was also not bad, but in her previous life, she was a proud D, ah! Why was it that traveling through time once, not only did her height shrink, even the bust was also such a big gap, ah?!</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi stare at her beautiful breasts, Guli deliberately lifted her hair and stopped in front of Murong Qi Qi as if she wanted to show off to her, and also challenge her. Even Guli\u2019s mouth revealed a provocative smile.</p><br/><p>There was no man who doesn\u2019t like a big breasted woman. Guli was absolutely confident in her body! Just now, she also looked at Murong Qi Qi. She\u2019s just a not even developed girl. Not ripe to the extreme. What does she (MQQ) have to compete with her (G)?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, this is the first time I came to Bei Zhou. There are many places I haven\u2019t been to. Don\u2019t know if wangye has the time to take me out for a stroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Guli\u2019s beautiful legs reached below the table towards Feng Cang\u2019s legs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

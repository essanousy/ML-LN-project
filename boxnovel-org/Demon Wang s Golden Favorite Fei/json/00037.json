Therefore, people can also become greater. They must first suffer and work to their bones, until their skin become stuck on their body from hunger, making their body weak. The road to one\u2019s appointed place is full of confusion, so it\u2019ll tempt people\u2019s heart and they are able to suffer what others won\u2019t. Once people survive that, they can change. Trap their heart, consider well and then make the move. The journey is full of colors showing one\u2019s inner voice. Such a person can\u2019t go home without capabilities and leave this foreign land without having suffered. They\u2019ve known hardship through life and will die of happiness too.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a poem MQQ wrote for MYC. MQQ is telling MYC that even though he is a hostage now (in a difficult situation), he can become stronger. He must first pass many hardships before he can get back to his appointed place (the future emperor of Nan Feng). During that process, he may have many doubts which will tempt him, but he will be able to overcome hardships that others can\u2019t. Once he passes through these hardships, he will become stronger. Make the decision, consider all possibilities and take action. His journey will be hard and he\u2019ll want to give up many times. A great person can\u2019t go home without having the abilities. After he understood all the hardships, he can enjoy his life and die in happiness.</p><br/><p>Just a few words made Ming Yue Cheng emotionally overwhelmed and burning with excitement. He looked at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s carriage which was travelling further away. Ming Yue Cheng clenched the letter in his hand. Only then did he notice a sentence written on the back: \u201cA great man has to be ruthless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng laughed out loud while looking at the direction of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s carriage. His eyes turned darker.</p><br/><p>That young maiden in white actually could see through his endurance of humiliation as part of an important mission. She actually could see deep into his heart. On one side, she\u2019s telling him to continue to endure. On the other side, she\u2019s telling him to assess the situation and look for an opportunity to use a killer move without letting the other party have time to react.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it\u2019s really a pity that you are getting married to Bei Zhou\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Fu Er didn\u2019t know what was written in the letter. Seeing that Ming Yue Chen\u2019s demeanor was not quite right, he quickly stepped forward and said with care: \u201cYour highness, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFu Er, that woman is my soulmate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng pointed forward. His eyes were firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I become the emperor, I will snatch her to be my empress!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, what did you write in the letter? Why is Nan Feng\u2019s crown prince laughing so happily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue glanced back curiously at Ming Yue Cheng, who stood there laughing.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi brushed the hair off her forehead, picked up the feather fan and gently shook it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just thinking with what identity should I form an alliance with this crown prince who is in dire straits\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Su Yue laughed. \u201cMiss, you have so many identities. Just take any out, wouldn\u2019t he be willing? But why do you want to help him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA crafty rabbit has three burrows.\u201d</p><br/><p>A crafty rabbit has three burrows: a sly individual has more than one plan to fall back on.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Su Yue turn silent. Indeed, going to the far away Bei Zhou this time, it\u2019s still unknown if it\u2019s a blessing or a curse. Having a place to retreat to is always good.</p><br/><p>After \u2018A glance at the mundane world\u2019, \u2018One laughter on azure water\u2019 once again swept the capital. More and more people wanted to learn Murong Qi Qi\u2019s easygoingness. But in the end, no one could be like Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Inside Ci Ning Palace, empress dowager Shangguan Fei Yan tasted Murong Xin Lian\u2019s lotus seed soup. She kept saying \u2018it\u2019s good\u2019.</p><br/><p>lotus seed soup</p><br/><p>Lotus seed soup</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and your big sister are alike. You all are well behaved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking empress dowager!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian took over Shangguan Fei Yan\u2019s bowl and then she filled some more for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you like it, Xin er1 will make it every day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child, your mouth is really sweet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, Shangguan Fei Yan has a good impression of Murong Xin Lian. Gentle and beautiful. Has a good personality. It\u2019s really pleasing to the eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall aijia2 imperial grandmother like Jing Tian! We all are one family. Calling aijia empress dowager really isn\u2019t intimate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing empress dowager say that, Murong Xin Lian was really happy. She immediately knelt and kowtowed: \u201cXin er thanks imperial grandmother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, get up, ah! Really a truthful child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei Yan let people help Murong Xin Lian up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, ah. Don\u2019t always run to aijia here. Making aijia hold a great-grandson is the real business! Put the heart you spend on aijia on Jing Tian instead. Aijia has wished for this great-grandson for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial grandmother\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian blushed but in her heart, she\u2019s secretly crying. Since the lake tour, Longze Jing Tian seemed to be acting colder to her. It\u2019s certainly because of that bitch Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you shy now? Young people, ah really have thin face. Take it slowly! You see, your big sister will soon add a prince to the imperial family. You also need to work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei Yan\u2019s words made Murong Xin Lian suddenly understand one thing. That is, the emperor hadn\u2019t named a crown prince yet. Seeing how Murong Xue Lian is currently favoured, maybe the prince she gives birth to would be bestowed the title of crown prince. Then won\u2019t her dream of crown princess, her dream of empress, become shattered?!</p><br/><p>No! The place of the crown prince is Longze Jing Tian\u2019s. The place of the crown princess is hers! She must think of a way to give birth to the first imperial grandson! They say that after a generation, the relation would be closer. Maybe by that time, the emperor would love the first imperial grandson and will then make Longze Jing Tian the crown prince.</p><br/><p>Previously, all of her fifteen years had been suppressed by Murong Xue Lian. With great difficulty, she had finally entered the imperial family. If she\u2019s still surpassed by her, then won\u2019t her efforts, her work and Zheng Min\u2019s death be wasted!</p><br/><p>After returning to the wangfu, 3 Murong Xin Lian once again prepared soup and delivered it to Longze Jing Tian\u2019s study. It had long become Lu Ye\u2019s snack. After these past few days, they were already familiar with it. Within their hearts, their impression of Murong Xin Lian, this cefei4 was not bad. They felt that she\u2019s beautiful and polite and didn\u2019t have the arrogance of those pampered noble ladies.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye5, ce wangfei sent soup to clear the heat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou drink it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian didn\u2019t even raise his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, how\u2019s the matter that I let you investigate going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering wangye, there was nothing wrong with Murong Qi Qi on the night of admiring the moon at the pavilion. But this subordinate found out another matter. It\u2019s that on that same night, ce wangfei\u2019s mother was having an affair with another man and got caught by the prime minister. Prime minister killed them on the spot. Regarding this matter, aside from the Duanmu family, the young masters and misses of the other three families were also present.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ye told Longze Jing Tian everything he found out whilst drinking the \u2018clearing heat\u2019 soup.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Such coincidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian touched his chin. He felt that there\u2019s something fishy. He believed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words. That woman dared to do and dared to admit. What she said must be true.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ye put down the bowl and wiped his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrime minister sealed all the mouths of the people of xiangfu6. To the outside, he said that concubine Zhang died of illness. At that time, ce wangfei was sick for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Lu Ye talked, the thirstier he felt. His whole body was hot. He couldn\u2019t help but fan with his hand. After that, he simple tore off his collar, but his whole body was getting hotter and hotter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian spotted Lu Ye\u2019s strangeness. He put his hand on Lu Ye\u2019s wrist. After he checked, the color of his face changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cServants, prepare cold water! Also, call the physician!\u201d</p><br/><p>The physician came over and carefully examined the \u2018clearing heat\u2019 soup.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering wangye, inside there\u2019s a medicine added which will let people act impulsive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The physician\u2019s words were very subtle. When saying it plainly, it\u2019s spring medicine (aphrodisiac). This result made the physician wonder. Could it be that wangye is unable to do that? He actually needs such stuff?</p><br/><p>Obviously, he guessed wrong. Longze Jing Tian seemed to have felt the physician\u2019s strange look. He looked at the physician coldly. The physician immediately lowered his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo look at him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian pointed at Lu Ye who\u2019s soaking in cold water.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a way to make him more comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering wangye, this medicine is too strong. The only remedy is woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian kicked down the stool. Now he finally came to understood the meaning of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words. Murong Xin Lian actually used such villainous ways to seduce him. If the one who had drank the \u2018clearing heat\u2019 soup today was him, then she would have surely succeeded.</p><br/><p>Just thinking that from the first moment he saw Murong Xin Lian, he had already entered her calculations, all her gentleness and goodness was a disguise, Longze Jing Tian felt that this woman was too disgusting.</p><br/><p>Presumably the matter of Zheng Min was because she wanted to calculate Murong Qi Qi but in the end, she ended up with an egg on her face. Then after thinking about how Murong Xin Lian used such low ways to deal with Murong Qi Qi, Longze Jing Tian felt fire in his heart which he had no place to vent.</p><br/><p>1.

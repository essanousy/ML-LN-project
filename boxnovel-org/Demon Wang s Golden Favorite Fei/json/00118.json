Everyone was waiting for them. With Wanyan Lie\u2019s grace, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t bow and only slightly paid her respect. Then, she was invited to sit down.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad! Very great!\u201d Wanyan Lie looked smilingly at Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi. He nodded repeatedly, \u201cZhen1 feels happy for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking uncle!\u201d Feng Cang answered smilingly, but his hand held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s soft body. At this time, Murong Qi Qi had her head lowered. Her face showed a smile of shyness. With one look, you would know she was a new wife.</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang being happy, inside Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart appeared an indescribable feeling. For so many years, his plan had never failed. This time, because of that bitch Yue Lan Zhi, one step went wrong, all steps went wrong. It seemed that he needed to get into contact with Nan Feng country! Feng Cang\u2019s happy smile was like a thorn, piercing his heart, making him bleed when he pulls that thorn out.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie was unhappy, Yu Shi Shi was even more unhappy. The man who originally belonged to her became Murong Qi Qi\u2019s. The embrace which originally belonged to her became Murong Qi Qi\u2019s. Seeing Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi show love towards each other in public, Yu Shi Shi\u2019s nails dug deep in her palm.</p><br/><p>Just as Yu Shi Shi was staring at Feng Cang\u2019s big hand which was holding Murong Qi Qi, a voice screamed, \u201cEmperor, save me!\u201d Then a girl stumbled and appeared in front of everyone. That girl\u2019s hair was dishevelled. On her body were only a few pieces of fabric. She was barefoot and walked in a hurry as if she couldn\u2019t feel the cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Murong Qing Lian entered and saw Wanyan Lie sitting in the front, all the grievances in her heart vented out, \u201cWa\u2026,\u201d She cried making everyone dumbfounded. Who was this woman? Why was she like this?</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian\u2019s appearance made the gentle smile on Dongfang Lan stiffen. This was her grandson\u2019s big day, how come such a woman appeared and dampened the spirit</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, save me! Emperor, save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the shoulders of Murong Qing Lian who had been tortured by Wanyan Hong for the whole night, were bloody teeth marks. Those purple and blue bruises were very shocking to the eyes, making Wanyan Lie frown. \u201cAre you not Xi Qi\u2019s contestant? How come you\u2019re like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Wanyan Lie said that, Lin Ke Xin remembered, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Emperor, she is Murong Qing Lian. Speaking of this, she is Nan Lin wangfei\u2019s2 little sister. She\u2019s Murong Tai\u2019s youngest daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being mentioned by Lin Ke Xin, Murong Qi Qi could no longer pretend not to know. She could only ask people to bring some clothes to cover the bruises on Murong Qing Lian\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d After wearing clothes and put on socks and shoes, Murong Qing Lian felt a lot warmer. She ran all the way here. She took advantage that Wanyan Hong wasn\u2019t paying attention and ran out. Just now, she was warm from running and didn\u2019t feel the cold. Now, that she stopped running, she couldn\u2019t help but shudder.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat had happened?\u201d Wanyan Lie\u2019s face was cold and looked at the pale faced Murong Qing Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, save me\u2026his highness the crown prince, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian hadn\u2019t finished speaking when a voice came over, \u201cEmperor father, this subject son wants to marry miss Murong as a cefei3 !\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Wanyan Hong\u2019s voice, Murong Qing Lian\u2019s body involuntarily trembled, \u201cNo! I don\u2019t want! I don\u2019t want to marry him! He\u2019s a sicko! He, he raped me\u2026woowoowoo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A \u2018rape\u2019 made the crowd think back about those bruises on Murong Qing Lian\u2019s body. They immediately understood what happened. Lin Ke Xin looked once heartfully at Murong Qing Lian. Then she looked once at Murong Qi.</p><br/><p>The two sisters of Murong family have good means, ah! The big sister married Nan Lin wang4, the little sister connected with the imperial crown prince. Truly powerful! Lin Ke Xin smiled and continued to maintain her gentle posture to watch a play.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want? Could it be you want to be the main consort?\u201d Wanyan Hong slowly approached Murong Qing Lian. Seeing him approach, Murong Qing Lian couldn\u2019t help but backed. In the end, she accidently tripped but had been timely pulled up by Wanyan Hong.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go! You sicko!\u201d Murong Qing Lian didn\u2019t dare to think about what she encountered the night before.</p><br/><p>This man insulted her the whole night! It was an endless bullying. No matter if it was the front or the back, all was tortured by him till they hovered between life and death. Especially that place; he actually touched there, making her feel very disgusted. She also got to know Wanyan Hong\u2019s sick side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sicko? Didn\u2019t you enjoy it before very much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong fiercely pinched Murong Qing Lian\u2019s waist and looked ferociously at her. This woman dared to kick his lifeblood (genitals), truly daring. Fortunately, he protected it in time, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it anymore. Truly a vicious woman! However, she\u2019s truly to his taste.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian struggling and wanted to beat him, Wanyan Hong grabbed her fist. He smiled, \u201cMiss Murong, perhaps in your body there\u2019s already this crown prince\u2019s blood and flesh. Could it be that you want to let Bei Zhou\u2019s imperial blood wander in the commoner world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Even if I die, I won\u2019t marry you!\u201d Murong Qing Lian couldn\u2019t accept what happened last night. Especially, she didn\u2019t even think about marrying Wanyan Hong.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, then go die!\u201d Wanyan Hong suddenly let go and pushed Murong Qing Lian to the ground. He also threw a dagger at her, \u201cYou want to die, this crown prince will let your wish come true! Be clean and neat, don\u2019t be half dead and then need to rely on this crown prince to finish the deed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, it was Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi who came to pay their gratitude in the palace. No one expected that in the end, Murong Qing Lian and Wanyan Hong would appear and made such a dramatic scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough!\u201d Seeing his son being more and more outrageous, Wanyan Lie coughed twice. \u201cIn the end, what had happened? Hong er5, did you really do things you need to be sorry for towards miss Murong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father, we\u2019re each other\u2019s sunshine! This subject son fell in love miss Murong at first sight. This day, after I confessed to miss Murong, she accepted this subject son. Then there was that thing that happened later\u2026Emperor father, this subject son truly loves miss Murong. Asking emperor father to decree marriage on us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian didn\u2019t want to marry Wanyan Hong. Her true one is Longze Jing Tian, not Wanyan Hong!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want? Then who\u2019ll want you?\u201d Wanyan Hong lowered his body while smiling. He glared into Murong Qing Lian\u2019s eyes which was full of fear, \u201cIf you don\u2019t marry this crown prince, could it be, you want to marry another with this broken flower and withered willow body? Would there be someone who would want you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Hong\u2019s voice was very low, so low only Murong Qing Lian could hear. His words were like a dagger, piercing in Murong Qing Lian\u2019s heart. That was right, she was no longer a virgin anymore. Besides, today so many people saw. It was impossible for Longze Jing Tian to still want her! She wouldn\u2019t be able to become Jing wangfei anymore!</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian\u2019s face became dead gray. Why was it like this? She obviously still had a future yesterday, why did it become like this today?</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good! don\u2019t be angry anymore!\u201d Wanyan Hong pulled Murong Qing Lian up. He carefully arranged her clothes. \u201cThis crown prince would be kind to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian didn\u2019t speak, she only cried silently. Her performance, became \u2018acquiescence\u2019 in the eyes of other.</p><br/><p>Humph! What a character, ah?! Just now, she courted death, but now she didn\u2019t even have the courage to die. What not wanting to be a cefei? This was obviously loosening the reins only to grasp them better! Lin Ke Xin drank tea and continued to watch the play. This matter was provoked by the crown prince. The crown prince is her son\u2019s rival. So, if she didn\u2019t watch the play now, till when should she wait?</p><br/><p>On the scene, the one with the worst expression was none other than Yu Shi Shi. Just now, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi irritated her. Now, her man and Murong Qi Qi came to irritate her!</p><br/><p>It was not that Yu Shi Shi didn\u2019t understand the bruises on Murong Qing Lian\u2019s body, in fact, she understood too well. It seemed that this woman endured a non-human torture, just as she also had in the past. However, she didn\u2019t understand how Wanyan Hong and Murong Qing Lian got together.</p><br/><p>Now, Wanyan Hong wanted to give Murong Qing Lian status. Besides, it was the second only to her cefei. This made Yu Shi Shi feel that she got a rival.</p><br/><p>Although this man wasn\u2019t the one she wanted, but the power and status this man gave her were things she was obsessed with! If there was no Wanyan Hong then she was nothing. Now, Murong Qing Lian put a foot inside it, the loss Yu Shi Shi suffered at Feng Cang\u2019s was aroused.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, marriage is a command from the parents and the matchmaker. Miss Murong\u2019s parents are not here and she isn\u2019t our Bei Zhou\u2019s citizen. I fear we should ask prime minister Murong for his opinion on this marriage,\u201d Yu Shi Shi gently opened her mouth. Hearing her speak, Wanyan Hong was only humphed coldly once, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t matter. Isn\u2019t Xi Qi\u2019s Jing wang here? As long as he agrees, it would be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Wanyan Hong mentioned Longze Jing tian, a eunuch trotted in and went to Jing De. He whispered in Jing De\u2019s ears. Jing De nodded and came to Wanyan Lie, \u201cEmperor, Xi Qi\u2019s Jing wang Longze Jing Tian seek attendance! The prime minister\u2019s wife Li Qiu Shui also came!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnounce them!\u201d</p><br/><p>From far away, a man and a woman walked over. The man was Longze Jing Tian and the woman was Li Qiu Shui. The moment, Murong Qing Lian heard Longze Jing Tian came, she broke away from Wanyan Hong\u2019s arms. She looked pitifully at Longze Jing Tian and wanted him to save her.</p><br/><p>That Longze Jing Tian appeared was not a surprise. What surprised Murong Qi Qi was Li Qiu Shui. Wasn\u2019t she in Xi Qi? Why did she come here? A bad premonition hit Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>As if he sensed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s unusualness, Feng Cang softly asked, \u201cQing Qing, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Murong Qi Qi slowly shook her head, but her eyes had been on Li Qiu Shui.</p><br/><p>Aside from Murong Qi Qi, the one who was surprised at Li Qiu Shui\u2019s appearance was Wanyan Lie, \u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, long time no see!\u201d Li Qiu Shui\u2019s smile was very generous and the way she talked with Wanyan Lie was like talking to an old friend. That kind of relaxation made people couldn\u2019t help but feel surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you come for?\u201d Wanyan Lie had no interest to reminisce the old times with Li Qiu Shui. The face which originally had a smile, immediately stiffened. Coldness emerged on his face, making Li Bing and Lin Ke Xin who were sitting at the right and left of him, feel cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to see my daughter, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian was also surprised at the way Li Qiu Shui spoke with Wanyan Lie. In the morning, Li Qiu Shui suddenly appeared. She had an expression of missing her daughter very much and begged Longze Jing Tian to bring her in the palace to see Murong Qi Qi once. So, he brought Li Qiu Shui to the palace. He didn\u2019t expect that this Li Qiu Shui an Wanyan Lie knew each other.</p><br/><p>Li Qiu Shui said she came to see Murong Qi Qi. Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t believe it. Murong Qi Qi also didn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>From the smile on Li Qiu Shui\u2019s face, Murong Qi Qi sensed a plot. Could she(LQS) had come for her (MQQ) history? Thinking about those words Li Qiu Shui reminded her before she (MQQ) left (Xi Qi) and also those unclean things on the wedding dress; could it be that she had been waiting for this day?</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, take down your Water Moon Mirror!\u201d Li Qiu Shui looked at Murong Qi Qi. In her eyes were no longer the love from before, instead there was a smile with coldness and ridicule.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater Moon Mirror?\u201d Hearing this, not only Wanyan Lie, but Dongfang Lan was also startled. The Water Moon Mirror was Wanyan Ming Yue loved possession. In the past, Wanyan Ming Yue often used the Water Moon Mirror to cover her true face to be able to sneak out and play. Why was this treasure at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s?</p><br/><p>Feng Cang felt odd at Li Qiu Shui\u2019s words. He had heard about Water Moon Mirror. He also saw it in the past. However, didn\u2019t this thing disappear with Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s death? Why was it at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s? Could it be that Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face was fake? What he saw was fake?</p><br/><p>Seeing the doubts in Feng Cang\u2019s eyes, Murong Qi Qi laughed once bitterly. Originally, she thought about hiding it from Feng Cang. The longer she could keep it a secret, the better. She didn\u2019t take Li Qiu Shui, this accident into account.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye1, I didn\u2019t deliberately keep it a secret from you (TLNote: uhm\u2026you did)!\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes were full of guilt, making Feng Cang feel heartache.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, don\u2019t be afraid. You have me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside Li Qiu Shui\u2019s eyes, Feng Cang\u2019s gentleness was a great mockery. \u201cQi Qi, take down your Water Moon Mirror. Let your (maternal) grandmother, your (maternal) uncle, right, and your biological big brother see your true appearance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening till here, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart sank. She completely went cold. Sure enough, sure enough it was like this! She didn\u2019t expect her small trace of hope had been buried alive by Li Qiu Shui.</p><br/><p>The people were more puzzled after hearing Li Qiu Shui say that. Seeing that Murong Qi Qi still didn\u2019t take down the Water Moon Mirror, Li Qiu Shui\u2019s hands flew at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face and wanted to seize the thing on her face.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had long been prepared for Li Qiu Shui\u2019s sudden attack. Just as Li Qiu Shui\u2019s hands was about to fell on her face, Murong Qi Qi grabbed Li Qiu Shui\u2019s hands and fixed her there.</p><br/><p>That Murong Qi Qi knew martial arts was outside of Li Qiu Shui\u2019s expectation. Seeing the coldness in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes, Li Qiu Shui laughed, \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t dare to take it off? Be good! Let mother help you take down the Water Moon Mirror!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my mother!\u201d Murong Qi Qi kicked Li Qiu Shui chest. Li Qiu Shui backed and fell at a distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough!\u201d Her chest felt pain. Li Qiu Shui coughed blood. \u201cYou\u2019re indeed Feng Xie and Ming Yue\u2019s daughter. You actually lied to everyone about having martial arts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about that I have martial arts?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stood up like a gallant martyr and walked to the centre of the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, ah?!\u201d Lin Ke Xin was muddleheaded. \u201cWhat (maternal) grandmother and uncle? What are you talking about?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet her say it, ah! Hahaha! When she takes down the Water Moon Mirror, you would see and would understand everything!\u201d While Li Qiu Shui was laughing, the corners of her mouth were bleeding. However, she seemed as if she couldn\u2019t feel the pain. It was as if now was her happiest moment.</p><br/><p>Seeing that everyone was looking at her, Murong Qi Qi knew that she couldn\u2019t cover this matter up today. It seemed that she could only face reality.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi raised her hand and removed the Water Moon Mirror from her face, revealing her original face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d The crutch with a dragon head in Dongfang Lan\u2019s hand fell with a \u2018bang\u2019 on the ground. \u201cMing Yue, you are, Ming Yue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie was also stunned. He collected so many women who looked like Wanyan Ming Yue, but none could be compared to the person in front of him. That is Ming Yue\u2019s face, that is Ming Yue\u2019s brows, that is Ming Yue\u2019s nose, that is Ming Yue\u2019s lips, even the aura from her body was Ming Yue\u2019s\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s heart beat very fast. So, so, it was like this\u2026 \u201cNo wonder you refused\u2026\u201d Feng Cang didn\u2019t finish his words, but he and Murong Qi Qi understood the meaning of those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I also only got to know the day before yesterday and didn\u2019t keep it deliberately from you.\u201d Murong Qi Qi was afraid that Feng Cang would misunderstood and quickly explained, \u201cI truly didn\u2019t do it intentionally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Seeing Murong Qi Qi like this, Li Qiu Shui laughed the hardest. She was also the happiest person, \u201cFeng Xie! Did you see?! Your daughter married your son! Hahaha! Your biological daughter became you son\u2019s wife, did you see?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qiu Shui\u2019s words answered the questions in everyone\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? You said, she\u2019s Ming Yue\u2019s daughter?\u201d Wanyan Lie rushed to her and grabbed her hand, \u201cThat child is still alive, isn\u2019t it? You took away that child? That child is her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! That\u2019s right! I took her away! I strangled my own daughter and let her take the place of my daughter to be raised in Murong household. I let her get the surname Murong and let her become the third miss Murong! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qiu Shui laughed till she cried. She looked viciously at Murong Qi Qi. All her emotions could only be described with the word \u2018hate\u2019. \u201cYou\u2019re not my biological daughter. Your father was Bei Zhou\u2019s great general Feng Xie. Your birth mother is Wanyan Ming Yue. Now, you know your identity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you do it?\u201d Although she guessed that perhaps this matter had something to do with Li Qiu Shui, but Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t find the reason why Li Qiu Shui hates Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue. Could there be something more inside this?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You ask me why?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if she heard the biggest joke, Li Qiu Shui struggled and got away from Wanyan Lie\u2019s grab. She wiped the blood from her mouth and walked to Murong Qi Qi, \u201cBecause Wanyan Ming Yue stole the man I loved! Because Feng Xie chose Wanyan Ming Yue and abandoned me! Because they were like a couple of immortals. Because they were happy making me envy and hate them!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When she had met Jin Mo earlier, Murong Qi Qi had already known that Feng Cang was in Xi Qi. Today, he came to visit Jue Se Fang, he seemed to be in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Just thinking once, Murong Qi Qi already guessed Feng Cang\u2019s intention.</p><br/><p>During this time, she seemed to have been \u2018pampered\u2019 till she had became spoiled by Feng Cang\u2019s care. Clothes, foods, houses, transportation, Feng Cang made all the arrangements for her. Even the plants and flowers in her Cui Zhu yuan1 had been specially sent by his people.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was even worried that she would not be accustomed to the food of Bei Zhou. He specifically sent the cook of his wangfu2 to chengxiangfu3 to make roast lamb, Mongolian hotpot (instant boiled mutton) and milk tea for her.</p><br/><p>This man must\u2019ve learned the trick to get someone\u2019s heart. He\u2019s obviously in Xi Qi, but never showed up. He just let everything around her, every stitch, every plant and trees be branded with his mark, making it so that even if she wanted to forget, it would be difficult. Have to say, this was a very good method. Now, even Su Yue and Su Mei are talking about how good Feng Cang is.</p><br/><p>Not long ago, news came from Fang Kui. On the first day Tong Bao Zhai had opened at Bei Zhou, the flower crown design Murong Qi Qi made with golden threads \u2018Autumn Flower\u2019 was bought by a mysterious person at a high price. That person was Feng Cang\u2019s subordinate. Feng Cang probably did it for the banquet at the palace!</p><br/><p>However, as to why Feng Cang was treating her so good made Murong Qi Qi feel very confused.</p><br/><p>According to research, his parents had died at the battle on Yangdang Mountain. The one who\u2019d turned the tables, making Xi Qi win the battle was Murong Tai. Feng Cang should be hating Xi Qi, hate the Murong family. So why does he want to marry her, this \u2018rubbish\u2019 from Murong family and keep spoiling her again and again?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he changed his method to get revenge? Does he want to get her to the top and then let her fall to her bones as revenge for his parents? If it\u2019s like this, then he picked the wrong person\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, you look\u2026 \u2026,\u201d Fang Tong opened his mouth. This matter was related to Murong Qi Qi, miss needed to make her own decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing through Fang Tong, Murong Qi Qi smiled: \u201cWhenever he takes a fancy to any clothes, just shout a high price. Having Nan Lin wang4 Feng Cang\u2019s campaign for us, Jue Se Fang would surely be on fire in Xi Qi country. This banquet at the palace is a good opportunity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking til here, Murong Qi Qi paused.</p><br/><p>The only clothes that could match \u2018Autumn Flowers\u2019 was the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019. If Feng Cang gave her \u2018Autumn Flower\u2019 in order to gain her favor, then only this \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 could match it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 out. He would surely love it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi slowly stood up. A silver light flashed from her hand. A little dandelion got hooked and was now in her sight. (TN: she hooked the flower from outside the window)</p><br/><p>Seeing miss taking action, Fang Tong didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that miss had sir Mozun\u2019s skills. The \u2018Grasp flower laugh\u2019 seen just now was one of sir Mozun\u2019s secret skills. If you got the strength right, then taking people\u2019s lives was a matter simpler than breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, tell him the poem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi got the dandelion down and stared at it thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t speak any further, Fang Tong bowed again and retreated. He personally took the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 to Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our shop\u2019s treasure \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Feng Cang was wearing a gauze hat and Fang Tong couldn\u2019t see this wangye\u2019s expression, but with his knowledge of his miss\u2019s craftsmanship, he must be shocked. If this future guye5 found out in the future that his miss is Guang Hua gongzi6, really don\u2019t know what kind of expression he\u2019ll expose!</p><br/><p>Although it\u2019s called \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019, in fact it has nothing to do with gold. It\u2019s a fire-red dress. The color was youthful and beautiful. On top, it\u2019s covered with a gold colored gauze.</p><br/><p>The most amazing thing was that on the gold colored gauze, there\u2019s landscape outlined on it. Thousand cranes flying, vigorous pines majestically towering over a cliff to covet a day, whereas breeze strokes the goldenrod cliff.</p><br/><p>And at the end of the cliff, there\u2019s a waterfall spraying many splashes. Even the drops were clearly outlined like they\u2019re alive. Under the waterfall, you would even be able to see a few fish swimming joyously.</p><br/><p>If it was a painting, it\u2019s already artistic. If it\u2019s on a dress, it could be considered a treasure.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang had never seen such a painting being drawn on clothes. So alive. It seemed that Jue Se Fang was so famous since it indeed had some capabilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s like what Fang Tong thought. Feng Cang really took a fancy on this \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid your gongzi say where this gold thread dress came from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen our gongzi designed this gold thread dress, he made a poem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang obviously had strong interest in this poem. Fang Tong saw this and acted according to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s order. He wrote down the poem and handed it to Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdvise gentleman to not pity gold thread dress, advise gentleman to cherish time (of being young), flowers blossoming may endure breaking but must break over time, don\u2019t stay there waiting till the flower breaks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice was very appealing to the ears. Even Fang Tong, as a man, felt very comfortable listening to it. It\u2019s just, don\u2019t know how the personality of this future guye is\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGuang Hua gongzi is really interesting! This dress, I\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang hadn\u2019t finished speaking when they heard an arrogant voice: \u201cBengong7 wants this dress!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the door stood a well-dressed girl. She rushed to \u2018Gold thread dress. There were stars shining in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! Really beautiful! Bengong finally understands why Nan Feng\u2019s imperial noble consort only loves Jue Se Fang\u2019s clothes! Imperial sister-in-law, look, isn\u2019t it really beautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one talking was princess Ping Yang Longze Yu Er and the imperial sister in law was Murong Xin Lian. The two originally came to prepare for the banquet at the palace. They heard that Jue Se Fang had come to the Xi Liang, so they came together.</p><br/><p>Xi Liang is the capital of Xi Qi.</p><br/><p>Since the lake tour, Longze Yu Er and Murong Xin Lian inexplicably became a lot closer. Maybe it\u2019s because the two of them don\u2019t like Murong Qi Qi. That\u2019s why they have so much in common to talk about. Longze Yu Er even saw Murong Xin Lian as her close friend and would talk about everything with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Xin Lian saw this \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019, her gaze never left it. Although she also wanted this dress, but Longze Yu Er was a princess. Her purpose today was to please Longze Yu Er, so she had to reluctantly cut her love.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen princess wears it at the banquet, princess will surely shine over everyone else there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er was very happy after hearing Murong Xin Lian\u2019s flattery. She took a fancy to this dress from the first glance. In Longze Yu Er\u2019s eyes, this dress was tailor made for her. And only her, this noble and excellent princess, had the right to wear this \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019.</p><br/><p>Fang Tong knew who she was, but miss said this dress was for future guye. Fang Tong naturally wouldn\u2019t let other people get it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry! This dress has already been bought by this young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing someone refuse her, Longze Yu Er angrily put on one hand on her hip. The other hand pointed at Fang Tong\u2019s nose. She said angrily: \u201cOpen your dog eyes and look clearly. Bengong is princess Ping Yang! Who took a fancy on this dress? Is the other party nobler than bengong?\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Yuan: part of a residence</p><br/><p>2. Wangfu: residence of the wangye</p><br/><p>3.

Today, because of the arrival of Nan Lin wang1 and princess Zhen Guo, this White Cloud Restaurant was very lively.</p><br/><p>Although everyone had seen Feng Cang many times, but no one had ever seen this legendary princess Zhen Guo.</p><br/><p>Ever since Murong Qi Qi came to Bei Zhou, she had been hidden by Feng Cang in the wangfu.2 Aside from going to the palace, meeting some royals and nobles, the citizens of this capital didn\u2019t have any opportunities to see Murong Qi Qi. Moreover, the appearance of Murong Qi Qi, after she took down the Water Moon Mirror, had been rumored to be extremely brilliant. Their hearts had long itched to see the now number one beauty of the world.</p><br/><p>Now, Nan Lin wang had brought princess Zhen Guo along and appeared at White Cloud Restaurant. This was simply explosive news. Not a while later, this news got out. Many people came after hearing the news, making White Cloud Restaurant become very crowded and packed. All had come to see the elegant bearing of this number one beauty of the capital.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, cousin-in-law, today White Cloud Restaurant certainly earned a lot. You say, should we let the boss treat our meals?\u201d Wanyan Kang leaned on the window of the second floor. The room they were in faced the arena of the restaurant below.</p><br/><p>\u201cA prince being so stingy!\u201d Wanyan Kang\u2019s words let Su Mei berate him lightly. \u201cOur miss isn\u2019t as stingy as you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not stingy, alright! Living at home is all about meticulous planning and careful accounting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Wanyan Kang and Su Mei bicker, Murong Qi Qi was in a very good mood. She nestled in Feng Cang\u2019s arms, \u201cCang, tell me, don\u2019t they look like a quarrelsome but loving couple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery much like!\u201d Feng Cang nodded and fed Murong Qi Qi the dim sum in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, do you like our Su Mei? If you like her, then come ask for her hand. I\u2019ll betroth Su Mei to you!\u201d Murong Qi Qi ate the dim sum in small bites, but her eyes swept over Su Mei and Wanyan Kang. The more she looked, the more she felt that their features had the similarity of an old couple. They\u2019re really a pair of living treasures.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, do you mean it? What do I need to ask for her hand? I\u2019ll go prepare!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I don\u2019t want to marry this skirt-chaser! I want to accompany miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two opened their mouths at the same time, but the words they said were in contrast of each other. After Murong Qi Qi heard that, she pretended to frown, \u201cAy, what to do? I was thinking to marry Su Mei off sooner, but Su Mei isn\u2019t willing. Then forget about it! It seemed that ah Kang didn\u2019t put his efforts in the right place, ah! After so long, he still didn\u2019t get the beauty\u2019s heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s teasing made Wanyan Kang anxious. He immediately grabbed Su Mei\u2019s hand, \u201cLittle Mei er,3 where do I look like a skirt-chaser? In my wangfu, there isn\u2019t even one woman! If you don\u2019t believe me, you can go search!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSearch, your head!\u201d Wanyan Kang\u2019s words were so straightforward, making Su Mei blush. She took her hand out of his. A chestnut knocked on Wanyan Kang\u2019s head. \u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t marry. I would like to accompany miss more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei and Wanyan Kang\u2019s relationship was so good, making Su Yue a bit envious. Su Mei\u2019s major turning point of lifelong import was already determined, then what about herself? Thinking till here, in front of Su Yue\u2019s eyes appeared Nalan Xin\u2019s shadow. Ever since she got to know that Nalan Xin had followed her, Su Yue didn\u2019t show Nalan Xin any good expressions. However, that man seemed to have a strong spirit. The more defeated he was, the more courageous he became. Every time he would come to her full of smiles, but was always left coldly by her at a side. Even then, Nalan Xin still didn\u2019t get angry.</p><br/><p>Major turning point of lifelong import: usually referring to marriage, since it\u2019s the biggest event in life</p><br/><p>It was just, soon afterwards, she remembered the real reason why Nalan Xin had approached her, which was to investigate Guanghua gongzi.4 He had just been using her. This let Su Yue\u2019s heart get a knot, which she was unable to untie.</p><br/><p>The group of people were still talking when Ruyi came in, \u201cWangye, Dong Lu\u2019s princess came. She wants to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe came so quickly!\u201d After hearing Ruyi, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mouth, which had originally showed her good mood, immediately pouted, \u201cShe came a lot faster than I expected!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDecline her, say I don\u2019t have time\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He faintly declined Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even want the slightest inappropriateness to provoke Murong Qi Qi into having other ideas. Now, in his heart, the most important person was Murong Qi Qi. Others, what did it matter if they were a princess or what, in his eyes, they were just fleeting clouds!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Although Ruyi knew this result, but he still had to come and settle it. When Ruyi went out and declined Xia Yun Xi, saying that wangye didn\u2019t have time, a thin layer of mist appeared in Xia Yun Xi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t wangye want to see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question of Xia Yun Xi was a bit awkward for Ruyi. Could it be to tell her, I\u2019m sorry, please return?! Our wangye wouldn\u2019t be interested in anyone other than wangfei.5 You should give up on this!</p><br/><p>If it was Ji Xiang, she would\u2019ve absolutely said this. However, Ruyi couldn\u2019t say such words. Besides, tears were already rolling in this princess\u2019 eyes in front of him, making it appear like he had bullied her. This made Ruyi somewhat not know what to do. So, he simply didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t make things difficult because of Ruyi\u2019s silence. Ruyi was only someone who ran errands. He only conveyed Feng Cang\u2019s meaning. However, Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t want to give up like this. She travelled all the way from Dong Lu for Feng Cang. If she gave up just because the other party had rejected her twice, then this love was not very firm.</p><br/><p>Now, getting Feng Cang\u2019s attention was what Xia Yun Xi wanted to do the most. As she thought about it, Xia Yun Xi saw White Cloud Restaurant\u2019s arena on the first floor. On the banner above it was written \u2018arena\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cArena?\u201d Xia Yun Xi was somewhat surprised. She immediately let Hong Ye go inquire what it was used for.</p><br/><p>A short while later, Hong Ye returned to Xia Yun Xi\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, although White Cloud Restaurant is a restaurant, but the most famous thing here is the arena on the first floor. No matter what kind of identity, what kind of status, what kind of wealth, everyone could perform at the arena in White Cloud Restaurant. Poetic songs or the four arts (zither, Go, calligraphy, painting); anything can be done!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen challenging a party, you can name the challenger. However, before that, you have to show your talent and get the public recognition. Only then, can you pick the opponent. The challenged party, unless he/she admits defeat on the spot, otherwise he/she can\u2019t refuse. As for the judges, they\u2019re White Cloud Restaurant\u2019s guests. Whoever gets the most applause and shouts is the victorious party!\u201d</p><br/><p>In a few words, Hong Ye listed all the characteristics of White Cloud Restaurant\u2019s arena.</p><br/><p>Battle on the arena? Challenge? This was a very novel thing. Seeing this arena, Xia Yun Xi suddenly felt that this was an opportunity. She needed to attract Feng Cang\u2019s attention and also tell the whole Yan capital that Feng Cang was the man she had set her eyes on. He would be her, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s prince consort!</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi whispered a few words in Hong Ye\u2019s ears. Hong Ye opened her eyes widely. She looked shocked at Xia Yun Xi, \u201cPrincess, do you really want to perform at the arena? You\u2019re a daughter of the noblest family, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>In ancient times, daughters of prominent families don\u2019t perform for outsiders. That is the work of prostitutes and dancers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong Ye, he refused to see me. If I don\u2019t do this, how could I attract his attention?! He forced me to this! I have to challenge princess Zhen Guo. He\u2019s Feng Qi Qi\u2019s big brother. Naturally, he would pay attention to the arena and would also pay attention to me. Like that, I would have the opportunity to see him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her princess\u2019s obsession with Feng Cang made Hong Ye very helpless. Since she was at Xia Yun Xi\u2019s side, the thing she heard most every day was the name \u2018Feng Cang\u2019. Xia Yun Xi simply was completely obsessed with Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi was set on this idea. She wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone\u2019s dissuasion. She stood upright on the arena and hit the drum. With the sound of the drum, the guests of White Cloud Restaurant knew that someone wanted to perform on the arena again. When everyone saw the beautiful girl, they were a bit surprised. It\u2019s actually a woman who wanted to perform on the arena? This was a new thing, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that woman? She\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d The one who wanted to perform was a woman. Besides, it was a beautiful woman. This was big news. Immediately, everyone\u2019s eyes concentrated on Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>Seeing the eyes of the audience downstairs, Xia Yun Xi knew that she had won this bet. In these times, were would there be women who showed their faces in public? Today, she threw everything out and stood here. Everything was for Feng Cang! She wouldn\u2019t give up easily!</p><br/><p>Had to say, what Xia Yun Xi wore today was very likeable. A plain white dress, plus those blue stars in her hair coupled with that demure and charming small face, which made everyone couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with upon seeing her. All of these people couldn\u2019t help but want to take her in their arms and protect her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, the woman on the arena is Dong Lu\u2019s princess\u2026Xia Yun Xi. It\u2019s said that she chased after Feng Cang to this place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At a side, Fu Er stood by Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s side and carefully served him. After Ming Yue Cheng returned to the country, he rewarded the very loyal Fu Er heavily. Now, Fu Er had been serving Ming Yue Cheng left and right.</p><br/><p>Within the first moments of Feng Cang\u2019s return, Ming Yue Cheng got this news. Knowing that he (FC) had brought Murong Qi Qi over, Ming Yue Cheng also arrived at White Cloud Restaurant. It was just, he had come late and didn\u2019t see Murong Qi Qi. Outside of Feng Cang\u2019s room, there were people guarding the door. Ming Yue Cheng found a place to sit down and drink.</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Yun Xi? Haha\u2026\u201d Ming Yue Cheng drank wine. His mouth revealed a perfect smile. \u201cJust don\u2019t know who\u2019s the person she picked!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng was at White Cloud Restaurant. Very coincidentally, Wanyan Yi was also there. Since Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi had returned to the capital, he let people watch every movement of Nan Lin wangfu.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang had accompanied Murong Qi Qi to White Cloud Restaurant. After he got this news, he\u2019d immediately rushed there. However, he stayed at another room. He would like to see what kind of trick Feng Cang was playing. This time, he came and actually saw Dong Lu\u2019s princess Yun, Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know why, but after seeing Xia Yun Xi for the first time, Wanyan Yi\u2019s heart suddenly jumped \u2018bang, bang\u2019 quickly. Although, having seen many beauties including Murong Qi Qi, such a peerless woman, but only when seeing Xia Yun Xi would his heartbeat accelerate. His face also got red.</p><br/><p>This woman was weak as the orchids in the wind. Clean, delicate, lovely and very moving. Dressed in a white dress, she was pure like snowflakes. Yun Xi, Yun Xi. She was really holy like a cloud. Looking at her, she would make people cherish her.</p><br/><p> (y\u00fanx\u012b): yun = cloud, xi=cherish</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi was more beautiful than Xia Yun Xi, but Wanyan Yi had always felt that in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s clear eyes hid things called arrogance and obstinate. He didn\u2019t like that. A woman need to act like a woman. Being like Xia Yun Xi was very good!</p><br/><p>All Xia Yun Xi thought of and wanted was Feng Cang. She wanted to attract Feng Cang\u2019s attention, but she didn\u2019t think that the one she would attract was Wanyan Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little girl is just a newcomer, asking everyone to look after me!\u201d Xia Yun Xi\u2019s voice was very soft. It was soft as wind and a bit warm. When it blew, it made people\u2019s heart itch. She bowed slightly and earned points for her impression.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, this little girl wants to challenge one person. But according to the rules of White Cloud Restaurant, before challenging, one must show their talents first. This little girl doesn\u2019t have many abilities. This little girl barely learned the zither for a few years. Please, forgive this little girl and don\u2019t laugh at this little girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi repeatedly said \u2018little girl\u2019, coupled with her feminine image, she soon got many people\u2019s favorable impression. Many people applauded to support her. There were also people who whistled. The whole scene suddenly livened up.</p><br/><p>Presumably, he must have seen her! Xia Yun Xi raised her head and looked towards the upper rooms. Feng Cang must be there. He should be able to see her.</p><br/><p>When the boss let people bring a zither up, Xia Yun Xi gently bowed to the crowd. Then, she sat in front of the zither. Her gestures and posture added more to the curiosity of the identity of this beauty.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s slender and jade like fingers moved over the strings. A song came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk\u2026\u201d Upstairs, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body was surrounded by a thin layer of jealousy. She didn\u2019t expect that Xia Yun Xi would pursue Feng Cang to this point. Longing for the youth\u2019s return? Was the person she longed for Feng Cang?</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, what to do? She\u2019s already like this! Ay\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi gave a long sigh. \u201cPutting down the identity of a country\u2019s princess and actually do to this step is not easy, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who\u2019d imagined that their love was reciprocated don\u2019t deserve pity.\u201d Feng Cang frowned slightly. His gaze swept once over Xia Yun Xi. Then he retrieved it. This woman, it seems that putting on artificial airs had already permeated deep into her bones. She was completely not as natural as his Qing Qing. The hidden resentment in this song was no different to a resenting wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cLonging for the youth\u2019s return?\u201d Downstairs, after Ming Yue Cheng heard this song, he almost choked on the wine in his mouth. He had long heard that Dong Lu\u2019s citizens were very open-minded. He didn\u2019t expect that the still not married princess would be able to pursue a man to this point. Really, not easy.</p><br/><p>It was just, when seeing Xia Yun Xi\u2019s pair of eyes that was full of affection and grief, Ming Yue Cheng couldn\u2019t help but sneer.</p><br/><p>At this moment, his mind thought about that proud woman playing the zither on the boat. Then, that one glance let that woman become imprinted in his heart. Under the sky, presumably there wouldn\u2019t be a woman who could compare to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lofty passion!</p><br/><p>Although Ming Yue Cheng couldn\u2019t take a fancy to Xia Yun Xi, but that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t have a market. For example, Wanyan Yi, at this time, had been charmed by Xia Yun Xi that he hovered between life and death. If it wasn\u2019t because he was in a public place, he would certainly have gone forward, taken Xia Yun Xi in his arms and smoothed away the melancholy between her eyebrows. How could such a girl not let people cherish and love her?!</p><br/><p>In Wanyan Yi\u2019s eyes, Feng Cang was absolutely not worthy of Xia Yun Xi. Putting aside her identity of princess and the Dong Lu behind her, just her as a person would let people\u2019s hearts ache for her and love her!</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi put all the longing she had for the past ten years into the sound of the zither and conveyed it.</p><br/><p>She believed that in this world, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone who loved Feng Cang more than her and would be concerned about Feng Cang\u2019s every move more than her. Although, the nine marriages of Feng Cang ended in failures and there were so many rumors about Feng Cang, but she wasn\u2019t afraid! She believed that Feng Cang wasn\u2019t the demon from the rumors. She also believed that only she was the most suitable for Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman is really nauseating!\u201d Wanyan Kang touched the layer of goose bumps on his body. Indeed, when playing the zither, it was necessary to be full of affection. However, the zither sound of this woman was too arousing of the sympathy and too grieving, making the whole body of the people who listened to it uncomfortable. It was like the whole world owed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026,\u201d After Murong Qi Qi heard Wanyan Kang\u2019s sentence, she laughed once. Don\u2019t know when a petal appeared in hands.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Wanyan Kang to understand, the petal in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand already rapidly flew towards Xia Yun Xi. Just when Wanyan Kang thought that Murong Qi Qi would destroy the zither and let Xia Yun Xi unbale to continue playing, the petal fell on the string.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoong\u2026,\u201d sounded. The string didn\u2019t break, but the sound was destroyed. The originally gentle sound, because of this grim sound, it changed taste. It was like a lovable woman with a duck like voice, blotting the landscape.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin in law, awesome!\u201d Just a petal, she was able to control to such a point. It was really rare in this world.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang couldn\u2019t help but open his eyes. The way he looked at Murong Qi Qi became different again. That strength, if it was one point more, the string would be broken; if it was one point less, the petal would float down and wouldn\u2019t made a sound. How long did one need to train to achieve such a state, ah?!</p><br/><p>That Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t stay calm made Feng Cang very happy. The jealousy of this little woman was really powerful, but he liked it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like listening to a resenting wife\u2019s song. It would affect the mood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi explained like that. Originally, she thought that Xia Yun Xi would give up playing because of the broken sound, she didn\u2019t expect that she (XYX) was a cockroach that was unable to be beaten to death. It was like she wasn\u2019t affected and continue to adhere, making Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t help but \u2018have a whole new level of respect\u2019 for this Dong Lu\u2019s princess.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this woman was different from the previous butterflies. She was somewhat difficult to deal with!</p><br/><p>Although the petal breaking the sound really made Xia Yun Xi become dazed, but it didn\u2019t affect her determination. Instead, it let her be very happy.</p><br/><p>From where the petal had come from, it should have been Feng Cang\u2019s room. Who was the one who shot it? Could it be Feng Cang? Then, did this mean that he had heard her zither? Did this mean that she was one step closer to him?</p><br/><p>If Murong Qi Qi knew that her shot would enhance Xia Yun Xi\u2019s fighting spirit, she would regret being impulsive because of jealousy.</p><br/><p>After the ending of the song, Xia Yun Xi won a thunderous applause. There were three reasons why people applauded for her. One, because her own image made the men, who had come to drink tea, raise the desire to protect her. Two, because her zither sound was completely mournful and very moving. Three, the insistence she showed when facing a problem. The insistence she showed made people feel more tenderness for this beautiful girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you! So, did I pass?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s question just fell, when someone shouted, \u201cPassed! Who does miss want to challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question came very timely. Xia Yun Xi was just waiting for someone to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person this little girl wants to challenge is princess Zhen Guo\u2026Feng Qi Qi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upstairs, after Murong Qi Qi heard Xia Yun Xi\u2019s voice, she laughed. How come every rival she\u2019d encountered would pick on her so directly? Why didn\u2019t they look for Feng Cang, this involved party?</p><br/><p>1. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Wangfu: residence of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>3. Er: term of endearment </p><br/><p>4. Gongzi: young master</p><br/><p>5. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He held little master Feng Huang in his arms, allowing her to see a farther scenery in a higher position. He stripped the lychee and fed it into little master Feng Huang\u2019s red lips.</p><br/><p>Because little master Feng Huang liked white, he ordered people to weave silk that was softer than the clouds to make new clothes for little master Feng Huang.</p><br/><p>In short, the emperor put all his indulgence on little master Feng Huang. He even wanted to make little master Feng Huang a princess, but was rejected by little master Feng Huang. At that time, little master Feng Huang said one sentence. The late emperor didn\u2019t pay attention, but I listened to it with my heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue Cheng, I don\u2019t want to be a princess! A princess is too far away from you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The late emperor saw these words as being childish, but I saw a certain thing from little master Feng Huang\u2019s eyes. At that time, my heart shook a bit, but when little master Feng Huang looked at me, I lowered my head.</p><br/><p>Little master Feng Huang was very satisfied with my performance. She willfully enjoyed the indulgence of the late emperor and wrote a letter to her parents saying that she liked Nan Feng and wanted to stay here.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t what Feng Qi Qi would think after she read that letter. I\u2019m afraid that she and Feng Cang may not know that their seven-year-old daughter had fallen in love with the late emperor. Light flashed inside that pair of clear eyes. Aside from I, this outsider, who can see thoroughly, even the late emperor didn\u2019t take notice.</p><br/><p>Little master Feng Huang stayed in the palace for eight years.</p><br/><p>Eight years were like a shuttle. Little master Feng Huang had grown from a little girl to a slender and elegant woman.</p><br/><p>At that time, Feng Qi Qi no longer showed her face to the world. The title of the number one beauty went from princess to Ming Yue to Feng Qi Qi, and then fell on little master Feng Huang.</p><br/><p>Although, she was only fifteen years old, little master Feng Huang has become a famous beauty in the mainland. She was pure as the dew on the green leaves in the morning and clean like the snowdrops on the top of the sky. Everyone who saw little master Feng Huang would become intoxicated by her gentle laughter and affectionate voice.</p><br/><p>Like her mother, she had an eye-catching charm and a modesty that couldn\u2019t be found in the nobility.</p><br/><p>The good name of little master Feng Huang became known to all as she grew older and became the object of love of the young masters.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue Cheng, I don\u2019t like those men!\u201d Little master Feng Huang was gentle. Her face would only change at one moment; that was, when someone confessed to her. Every time when little master Feng Huang say this sentence, the late emperor would rub her head gently and ask affectionately, \u201cWhat kind of man does Long Er like? I will find him for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little master Feng Huang had always been straightforward. I still remember the first time she said that. The late emperor was startled at first and then laughed out loudly, \u201cLong Er, I\u2019m already old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two hidden meanings were revealed with the late emperor saying this. The first one was that he already knew the love little master Feng Huang had towards him. The second was that he wouldn\u2019t accept the feelings of little master Feng Huang.</p><br/><p>Such an answer, how could someone as clever as little master Feng Huang not know the hidden meaning? However, her answer was even more surprising, \u201cMing Yue Cheng, I wouldn\u2019t give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>If someone asked me, what will happen when two people with a strong will collide, I would tell him that, that was a test of the heart and the affection. It would be the same struggle as running a long-distance marathon. It would be\u2026rocked by a major disaster!</p><br/><p>On little master Feng Huang\u2019s sixteenth birthday, I saw Feng Qi Qi again. When she stood together with little master Feng Huang, her age couldn\u2019t be told. Those who didn\u2019t know would think that they were a pair of twin sisters.</p><br/><p>Those who came with Feng Qi Qi were her husband and sons. Their family was riunited in the palace of the late emperor.</p><br/><p>To be able to see Feng Qi Qi, the late emperor was very happy. The smile on the late emperor\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t disappear for the whole night. When this scene fell on little master Feng Huang\u2019s eyes, it clearly became a pain.</p><br/><p>That night, the late emperor got drunk. I served at his side. Deep in the night, little master Feng Huang suddenly came over. She was dressed thinly and lay next to the late emperor. I was so shocked that I almost screamed. She firstly hit my pressure point, making me unable to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you take one more glance at me? We\u2019re only twenty-six years apart! Why wouldn\u2019t you accept me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little master Feng Huang snuggled in the arms of the drunken late emperor. She looked pitiful like a child. Her appearance and her tearful voice made me feel heartache.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the emperor was born, I wasn\u2019t born yet. When I was born, the emperor is already old. However, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when little master Feng Huang wanted to kiss the late emperor, the late emperor opened his eyes and stopped her \u2018absurd\u2019 behavior.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Er, from the start till now, my heart only has your mother. She\u2019s the love of my life and also the only woman that I love. You once asked me why the harem was empty. I didn\u2019t answer you. Now, I will tell you, I once promised your mother, the position of the empress will always be reserved for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Er, you are only a child in my eyes. I can\u2019t be together with your mother, but I treated you and your brothers as my children. I only love you dearly, but it\u2019s not the love between a man and a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Er, you should find a young man to love you and not cling to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>I feel that the words of the late emperor were a bit cruel to little master Feng Huang. That treasure that the late emperor held in his hands, tears fell from her eyes for the first time in my memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you love my mother, but I won\u2019t give up. Here has me!\u201d Little master Feng Huang put her hand on the late emperor\u2019s chest. \u201cYou have me in your eyes and in your heart. You can lie to me, but you can\u2019t lie to yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, little master Feng Huang ran out barefooted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Er\u2026\u201d If it was in the past, the late emperor would definitely chase after her. The night was dark, the wind was strong and little master Feng Huang ran barefooted, the late emperor would definitely be worried about her. However, this time, the late emperor only called little master Feng Huang\u2019s nickname once but didn\u2019t chase after her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFu Er, did I do wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The late emperor asked me, but my pressure point was hit. I couldn\u2019t make a sound. Even after my pressure point was released, I couldn\u2019t answer this question to the late emperor. After all, I\u2019m not the involved party. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with this and couldn\u2019t feel all the emotions of this matter. Naturally, I couldn\u2019t say anything about this.</p><br/><p>After that night, little master Feng Huang left a letter and left without saying goodbye. The letter only said that she wanted to travel through the mainland to let herself become mature. However, I obviously saw an emotion called heart-tearing pain on the late emperor\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>In the days that followed, little master Feng Huang would sent letters every three days. It was still the handwriting that the late emperor was familiar with. The content was nothing more than where she had gone to and what she saw. It was just, at the end of each letter, little master Feng Huang would write a sentence, \u201cWait for me to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kind of thing had been going on for a year. Suddenly, little master Feng Huang didn\u2019t send more letters. For a long time, she didn\u2019t write a letter.</p><br/><p>During that time, I obviously was able to detect that the emperor was not right. When he was reading the memorials, he would immediately raise his head when he heard footsteps. He wanted to know if it was the eunuch who brought little master Feng Huang\u2019s letter. The repeatedly disappointment made the late emperor\u2019s face graver and also made him thinner.</p><br/><p>Little master Feng Huang disappeared like that out of nowhere. Even her family didn\u2019t know where she went. After reading the letter written by Feng Qi Qi, the late emperor was completely anxious. Feng Huang had always been filial. She wouldn\u2019t not keep in contact with her family. However, this time, even her family didn\u2019t know where she went. The late emperor was sure that something had happened to her.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao was recalled by the late emperor. The late emperor passed the throne to him. He took the letters written by little master Feng Huang and began to trace the footprints of Feng Huang. In other words, the late emperor walked on the roads she walked on and drank the soup she tasted\u2026The late emperor began from the first letter and followed the footsteps of each letter to explore the whereabouts of little master Feng Huang.</p><br/><p>Contrary to the attitude of the late emperor, Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t seem the slightest bit worried about her daughter nor did she send people to search for little master Feng Huang. This was a bit unusual. I noticed it, but I didn\u2019t tell the late emperor. I just followed him all the way. In the end, we reached Xiliang City, the former capital of Xi Qi.</p><br/><p>At this point, Xi Qi had already become Nan Feng\u2019s territory for many years. Returning once again to the place where we were held hostage for ten years, my heart had too many emotions.</p><br/><p>The last letter of little master Feng Huang was sent from here. After that, there was no more news of her.</p><br/><p>I and the late emperor took the portrait of little master Feng Huang and posted it everywhere. So, people could help find the whereabouts of little master Feng Huang. We stayed for a month.</p><br/><p>This month, I watched the late emperor change from a mature and handsome man to someone dirty. A layer of beard grew on his clean chin which looked very decadent, dispirited and listless.</p><br/><p>\u201cFu Er, I lost her.\u201d The late emperor looked at the coming and going people in the city of Xiliang and said that to me. There was endless remorse in this statement which made me pity this emperor.</p><br/><p>The late emperor, this involved party probably wasn\u2019t aware that his love for her had changed long ago from the love of an elder for the younger generation to a love between a man and a woman. It was said that the person on the spot is baffled, the onlooker sees clear. Although, I was an onlooker, but I couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>The person on the spot is baffled, the onlooker sees clear. The not involved party sees more of the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, this is something a sister asked me to give you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when the late emperor fell into loneliness once again, a child with a teapot hairstyle, stuffed a note to the late emperor and then ran away laughingly.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know when I saw this scene, I suddenly felt that hope was coming. Before I reacted, the late emperor already ran away regardless of his image.</p><br/><p>I was old and really couldn\u2019t keep up with the late emperor. I could only hire a carriage and chased. When I caught up with the late emperor, we had come to a lake. A small boat was parked on the shore. It seemed to be waiting for us.</p><br/><p>When we went by boat to the big boat in the middle of the lake, a sound of zither came over. At that time, I clearly saw that the hand of the late emperor began to tremble. Only she could play such a beautiful music.</p><br/><p>As a qualified servant, I didn\u2019t follow the late emperor. Instead, I left this place for them.</p><br/><p>However, even so, I heard little master Feng Huang\u2019s voice. I swear that I only heard two sentences. Those sentences said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, you met my mother on this boat and fell in love with her. Now, you met me here, can you also love me once?\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened after that, I don\u2019t know. Even if you question me intensely, I don\u2019t know what had happened. Forgive me for being an old man. Old people forget easily. I don\u2019t remember many, many things anymore.</p><br/><p>Maybe, you will say that I was playing the fool. Then, you are very right! As a servant who lived for sixty years in the palace, to be able to live, there must be a way to survive and keep his life. For example I, I know what I should and shouldn\u2019t say. I also know when I should understand things and when I should play the fool.</p><br/><p>I can only tell you that after this, the late emperor accompanied little master Feng Huang to the Number on village under Heavens in Yongzhou. I am old. The late emperor was compassionate. He didn\u2019t let me follow. As for what had happened there, I don\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>What I do know is that the ending of this story is clich\u00e9. The late emperor and little master Feng Huang lived happily together. Everyone one, including I, this old eunuch who couldn\u2019t get any older, lived happily.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

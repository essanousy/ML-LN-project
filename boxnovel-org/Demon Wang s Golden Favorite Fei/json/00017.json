He needed to go to Liu Yan Zhi\u2019s to search for consolation. After all these kind of matters really hurt a man\u2019s self-esteem.</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian looked once at the fainted Murong Xin Lian, sneered and also went back to Lan Xiang yuan1.</p><br/><p>After quite a while did Murong Xin Lan slowly woke up. The maroon blood on the ground reminded her what just happened. Murong Tai actually killed her mother in front of her. No matter what Murong Xin Lian couldn\u2019t accept this.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Nao, come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian looked gloomily at Ma Nao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy was my mother here? Where is that slut Murong Qi Qi? And where is Murong Jun? Should it not have been them who should be here?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, this slave doesn\u2019t know, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Nao had also been scared to death by what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis slave obviously helped third miss get in the bed. Later I also led young master here. Why it became like this, this slave also doesn\u2019t know, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian didn\u2019t listen to Ma Nao\u2019s explanation. She only wanted to vent. She wanted to vent the anger and sadness in her heart. Murong Xin Lian pulled out a hairpin and fiercely stabbed it in Ma Nao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBitch! You cause my mother to die! Give my mother back to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Nao raised her arm to dodge. This kind of action made Murong Xin Lian more furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI let you dodge! I let you dodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian grabbed Ma Nao\u2019s hairs. She directly stabbed the hairpin into Ma Nao\u2019s eye. She pricked once, but it didn\u2019t lessen her hate. She pricked above ten times.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, spare me! Second miss spare this slave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Nao\u2019s miserable cries attracted the servants over. When they saw Murong Xin Lian\u2019s ferocious appearance and the small and large holes full of blood on Ma Nao\u2019s face, everyone was scared till they were in daze by Murong Xin Lian\u2019s cruel means.</p><br/><p>Was this still the gentle and pleasant second miss? Could it be that this was second miss\u2019s true colors? In a moment, the image that Murong Xin Lian shaped so hard, fell apart. But at this moment, Murong Xin Lian didn\u2019t care about that. Zheng Min had been caught in bed. She, this second miss had long lose all face.</p><br/><p>Even if Murong Tai blocked everyone\u2019s of the mansion\u2019s mouth, there was no guarantee that others wouldn\u2019t tell; for example the young masters and miss of the three great families. Now her face was gone, why did she still need to care about image?!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Murong Xin Lian only wanted to vent. Vent the anger inside her. Until Chen Zhong appeared again and dragged the tragic sight of Ma Nao with a body covered in blood away, did Murong Xin Lian sat limply on the ground.</p><br/><p>Over, all was over. Today\u2019s matter would let her become Murong household\u2019s, no, she will become the joke of the capital! No one will marry her who had such a matter. No need to mention Jing wangfei2, even becoming a concubine to warm Longze Jing Tian\u2019s bed was now impossible\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian sobbed for a while. Until everyone had left, did Fei Cui came.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond miss, condolences!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui handed a handkerchief to Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t give up like this, ah! Someone certainly tempered with today\u2019s matter. You must pick yourself up and get revenge for concubine Zhen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Cui\u2019s words pulled Murong Xin Lian from her grief. That was right, she couldn\u2019t give up like this! Why did the matter become like this? She must find the reason. She couldn\u2019t let Zheng Min die unjustly!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you look carefully?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun gritted his teeth and glared full of hate in the direction of Ou Xiangyuan. Murong Xin Lian actually calculated him and Murong Qi Qi to ruin their reputations! That bitch was really malicious!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Jun looked at the person in black. If it wasn\u2019t because of this person\u2019s help, the one who would\u2019ve died on Murong Tai\u2019s sword tonight would be him, Murong Jun!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t continue looking at that bitch pretending!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in black left this sentence and disappeared from the room. Seeing that no one was here, Murong Jun hurriedly left. After he left, the person in black went to Cui Zhu yuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, the matter is finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in black ripped of the black cloth on her face. It was Su Yue. She made an \u2018ok\u2019 gesture at Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi was sketching on a paper. Su Yue went forward and looked. Murong Qi Qi is designing jewelries, hairpins, earrings, buckles, bracelets, rings\u2026\u2026 a set. All have a Begonia flower design.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, are these for Bai family\u2019s eldest miss? So beautiful! It really matches miss Bai\u2019s aura!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClever!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi nodded. After the final brush, Murong Qi Qi put down the brush and carefully dried the ink.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, tomorrow you make a trip to Tong Bao Zhai. Let master Li make the jewelries with the best jade. The sooner the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did miss save Murong Jun? Making that stick be ruined isn\u2019t it very good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enemy of my enemy is our friend. With one more person to resent Murong Xin Lian, will I not have more time to sleep\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei and Su Yue glanced at each other and laughed. Miss was like this. Those who treated her well, even if it was with a drop of water, she would remember. Those who were bad to her, she would also not let go.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi Yue would have never thought that today she unintentionally helped Murong Qi Qi, she would be able to get \u2018Guang Hua gongzi\u2019s\u2019[] 3. Gongzi: young master/ also used to call a famous unmarried man] full set of jewelry. If she knew that the Guang Hua gongzi from the rumors was Murong Qi Qi, how would she feel?</p><br/><p>Recently, too many things happened at Murong fu3. Third miss Murong Qi Qi injured miss Duanmu, cutting of the tendons of his right hand. Duanmu Lei filled a lawsuit at the imperial censor. Murong fu\u2019s favored concubine Zheng suddenly died from illness. Second miss couldn\u2019t accept the fact that her mother had passed away and was sick in bed\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>1.

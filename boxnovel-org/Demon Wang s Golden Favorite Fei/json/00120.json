How would she die?! The one who died was her maidservant Cai Hua! She (CH) was the scapegoat! Ming Yue had great fortune and big blessing, how would she die?!\u201d When Li Qiu Shui spoke, her gaze fell on Wanyan Lie, making Wanyan Lie startled. This woman is a madman. Could she want to pour out everything that happened in the past? No! Can\u2019t let her say!</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue didn\u2019t die? Where is she?\u201d The moment Dongfang Lan heard that, she stood up. Her daughter didn\u2019t die? Ming Yue didn\u2019t die!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I need to tell you?! Since I\u2019m unhappy, I\u2019ll let all of you be unhappy! Besides, which one of your ears heard me say that she is still alive? I only said that after Ming Yue gave birth to her, she didn\u2019t die. How would I know what happened after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you do to my Ming Yue?\u201d Dongfang was clearly able to see the hate in Li Qiu Shui\u2019s eyes. She immediately determined that everything was done by Li Qiu Shui, including the battle fifteen years ago at Yandang Mountain. Maybe, Li Qiu Shui had credit in it. \u201cTalk!\u201d Wanyan Lie also berated at a side.</p><br/><p>Although Dongfang Lan was very imposing, but Li Qiu Shui wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><br/><p>She came here today and didn\u2019t expect to go out alive from here. Originally, she thought to come look at the joke of Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang. How would she know that the matter didn\u2019t happen according to how she planned? She planned for so long, but everything was for nothing. This let all the grief and indignation in Li Qiu Shui\u2019s heart be released.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, what right do you have to command me?\u201d Li Qiu Shui pointed at Dongfang Lan. Then she turned to Wanyan Lie, \u201cAnd you, you even more don\u2019t have the right to command me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qiu Shui laughed while her eyes were fixed on Wanyan Lie. Her expression was mysterious, \u201cWhat are you?! Do you think your nauseous face could be hidden from them for a whole life? You let me talk? What do you want me to talk about? Talk about how I calculated Feng Xie or talk about the past relationship between me and you or talk about that you like your own biological\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous!\u201d Not waiting for Li Qiu Shui to finish, in her lower abdomen was a four-inch sword. It went from her abdomen directly into her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cPooh,\u201d A mouthful blood of Li Qiu Shui sprayed on Wanyan Lie\u2019s face. Now, he wanted to silence her? He wanted to kill her to block her mouth? He wanted to cover the thing that happened that year? He wanted to hide his true self?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to silence\u2026\u201d Wanyan Lie\u2019s hand put more force. The sword completely buried into Li Qiu Shui\u2019s stomach. \u2018Shua\u2026\u2019 Wanyan Lie fiercely pulled out the sword stained with blood. Blood burst out form the wound.</p><br/><p>\u201cShui er1!\u201d Murong Tai couldn\u2019t stop Wanyan Lie. He could only catch Li Qiu Shui, \u201cShui er, Shui er, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Tai\u2019s anxious expression, Li Qiu Shui wanted to laugh. The blood poured from her mouth were like a stream, unable to stop. In a moment, it stained the place on her chest. \u201cDidn\u2019t\u2026didn\u2019t expect\u2026in the end\u2026I\u2026died\u2026in\u2026your embrace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShui er, don\u2019t talk. I\u2019ll take you to a doctor. Don\u2019t talk!\u201d Murong Tai wanted to use his hand to block the blood from coming out of Li Qiu Shiu\u2019s wound. However, the blood were like river and poured out through his fingers. It made Murong Tai\u2019s hand red.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026it\u2019s useless\u2026\u201d After every word Li Qiu Shui said, at the corner of her lips a red blood flower would bloom. On her forehead were big drops of cold sweat. Her body also couldn\u2019t help but shiver. Looking at Murong Qi Qi, Li Qiu Shui\u2019s lips trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026am going to\u2026see your father\u2026or\u2026I didn\u2019t win from your mother\u2026after I died\u2026I will still fight with her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing, Li Qiu Shui\u2019s head slightly turned. With a magnificent smile, she left the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cShui er! Shui er! Ah\u2026\u201d Murong Tai screamed sorrowfully like an injured wolf. His screams echoed on throughout the harem. \u201cShui er, Shui er, don\u2019t leave me! You\u2019re right. There was nothing between us, but I\u2019m willing to be your small dog and follow every day at your feet. It\u2019s fine if you hit me and scold me. Shui er! I beg you, wake up! Don\u2019t leave me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Tai like this, Longze Jing Tian was about to go to him and comfort him. However, he didn\u2019t expect Murong Tai to take the sword from Wanyan Lie\u2019s hand and stab it in his own belly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrime minister!\u201d Longze Jing Tian was startled and went forward to support Murong Tai. Unexpectedly, Murong Tai broke free from his hand and tightly hugged Li Qiu Shui, \u201cYou want to rest and fly together with Feng Xie\u2026I don\u2019t allow it\u2026even in death\u2026I\u2019ll wind around you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrime minister\u2026,\u201d Longze Jing Tian had never seen such a hysterical love, \u201cWhy, is it worth it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJing wang2\u2026I beg you, burry me and Shui er together\u2026I beg you\u2026\u201d Blood poured out of Murong Tai\u2019s nose and mouth. He struggled to keep one breath and tightly pulled Longze Jing Tian\u2019s sleeve, \u201cI beg you\u2026must burry together\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian couldn\u2019t understand the kind of love like that of Murong Tai and Li Qiu Shui. However, to a dead man\u2019s request, he still nodded and accepted, \u201cPrime minister, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll let you be buried together forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Longze Jing Tian\u2019s promise, Murong Tai revealed a smile of happiness. His hands were slightly trembling. He pushed aside the hair on Li Qiu Shui\u2019s forehead, \u201cShui\u2026Shui er\u2026we will never\u2026be separated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy! Daddy!\u201d Murong Qing Lian who had been scared out of her wits, now finally realized that her only supporter was about to leave. She quickly crawled to Murong Tai, \u201cDaddy, don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEheh\u2026,\u201d At this point, Murong Tai was unable to speak. He only smiled and looked once at Murong Qing Lian. There was no regret in his eyes. His eyes were filled with happiness, filling every corner of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai and Li Qiu Shui\u2019s death made the atmosphere become heavier. They didn\u2019t expect that in this world there was such extreme love. Really don\u2019t know how to describe them. Presumably, the love they weren\u2019t able to get it was the most perfect in their heart!</p><br/><p>The only one person who kept a clear mind and was cheering at Li Qiu Shui\u2019s death was Wanyan Lie. Li Qiu Shui died. The person who knew his secret died. In the future, he could still play the role of a good uncle and could pamper Murong Qi Qi like how he pampered Ming Yue. How beautiful, ah!</p><br/><p>In Wanyan Lie\u2019s eyes, the future was bright, the road was smooth. Regaining Murong Qi Qi was his happiest matter! He fantasied countless of times that he could have one princess so well-behaved like Wanyan Ming Yue. However, it seemed that the consorts\u2019 belly didn\u2019t live up to his expectations. His only daughter was Wanyan Bao Zhu, but she couldn\u2019t even compare to a half Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>Now, Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s biological daughter stood very alive in front of him. How could Wanyan Lie not be happy?!</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie tried out calling Murong Qi Qi once. When she turned her head, Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart was jumping badly. Alike, so alike! The side of her face was exactly like Ming Yue\u2019s! Wanyan Lie almost cried from joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, now you know your identity, do you want to acknowledge your roots and ancestors?\u201d Wanyan Lie carefully asked Murong Qi Qi\u2019s opinion. He wanted to know her thoughts. It was no means to force her. This is Ming Yue\u2019s daughter, ah! His niece, ah! And she\u2019s about to become the noblest princess of Bei Zhou!</p><br/><p>Acknowledge her roots and ancestors\u2026Hearing this, Murong Qi Qi looked at Feng Cang. The truth was so cruel. She really is Feng Cang\u2019s little sister! Once her lover, now became her biological big brother. Murong Qi Qi somewhat couldn\u2019t accept this, but she had no way not to admit to this fact.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s painful expression made Feng Cang\u2019s heart feel like it was pierced. His little wangfei3 is now so sad like a melancholic lark. She lost her vitality. Obviously, there were tears in her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing!\u201d Feng Cang couldn\u2019t take it anymore and took Murong Qi Qi in his arms, \u201cQing Qing, if you want to cry, then cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoo woo\u2026\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s words were like a key and opened the closed gate of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart. Her tears rushed down. Murong Qi Qi nestled in Feng Cang\u2019s arms and cried like there was no one around.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s crying also made Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart hurt. If such a thing didn\u2019t happen, then she would be a perfect couple with Feng Cang and would be so in love that it would make others jealous. However, in a blink of eye, lovers became siblings. How could Murong Qi Qi accept that?</p><br/><p>Although Longze Jing Tian also wanted Murong Qi Qi, but seeing her so sad, his heart also felt painful. If he could, he was willing to unwrinkled Murong Qi Qi\u2019s frowning brows, wipe her moist eyes, warm her wounded heart and carefully care for her during her every mood.</p><br/><p>Have to say, a beauty crying was a beautiful picture. Looking at Murong Qi Qi sobbing beautifully in Feng Cang\u2019s arms, Wanyan Hong\u2019s heart almost jumped out. He had seen many beauties, but have never seen one like Murong Qi Qi; beautiful to pureness, beautiful to cleanness woman\u2026.</p><br/><p>Such a beautiful woman should have been made for him. No matter what, he needed to get Murong Qi Qi! Even if it was using dirty handed means, he needed to be unscrupulous!</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, don\u2019t cry! It\u2019s uncle who was bad. If you\u2019re sad, then hit uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie was completely at his wit\u2019s end at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s crying. It was like in the past, every time Wanyan Ming Yue cried, his heart would hurt very much. Now, seeing Murong Qi Qi like this, he was also sad, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want, uncle won\u2019t force, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Wanyan Lie\u2019s words, Murong Qi Qi raised her head. A pair of teary eyes looked at Wanyan Lie. Wanyan Lie couldn\u2019t understand the emotions inside those eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, alright! Go home! Go home!\u201d Wanyan Lie quickly accepted Murong Qi Qi\u2019s only request. He immediately let people prepare the carriage to bring Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang back to Nan Lin wangfu.</p><br/><p>Originally, Dongfang Lan wanted to have a talk with her granddaughter, but seeing Murong Qi Qi crying so sadly, Dongfang Lan also held back. This child, ah! She must be sad! Her relation with Feng Cang was so good. no one thought it would become like this! Let her go home! When her mood is better, she would let her come into the palace.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi without any scruples till they entered the carriage.</p><br/><p>The carriage slowly left the palace. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t say anything. Her eyes were red like a small rabbit\u2019s. seeing her like this, Feng Cang\u2019s heart ached a lot. \u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, now, do I need to call you big brother?\u201d A \u2018big brother\u2019 let the tears of Murong Qi Qi fell again. What an ironic appellation! If there wasn\u2019t the accident of Li Qiu Shui, she would call him husband. Now husband became big brother. How could Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart feel great about this?</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing!\u201d Feng Cang lowered his head and kissed the tears at the corners of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Qing Qing, if you cry, my world would be raining!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s gentleness made Murong Qi Qi sadder. What about now? What could they do now? Even if Feng Cang was the under one person and above ten thousand people Nan Lin wang, but it still couldn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s his little sister. Murong Qi Qi could now only cut off these feelings and burry it forever in her heart.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi just left, Longze Jing Tian stood out, \u201cYour respected majesty, I as Xi Qi\u2019s Jing wang want to ask for a marriage! I want to marry your niece, Feng Cang\u2019s little sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it had been identified that Murong Qi Qi is Feng family\u2019s daughter, but he didn\u2019t know how to address her. So, Longze Jing Tian could only use \u2018Feng Cang\u2019s little sister\u2019 to address Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>The moment he heard Longze Jing Tian took action so quickly, Wanyan Hong also didn\u2019t want to be outdone, \u201cEmperor father, this subject son fell in love with cousin at the first sight. Asking emperor father to decree marriage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian who was just crying for Murong Tai, after seeing these two men ask for Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand at the same time, sorrow entered her heart.</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian is the man she loves, but his mind only thought about Murong Qi Qi. She knew this. However, now Murong Qi Qi became a free woman, making him have a chance. How could Murong Qing Lian not feel sad?</p><br/><p>As for Wanyan Hong, just now he was saying he wanted to marry her as his cefei4, his soul and spirit had been turned upside down by Murong Qi Qi. He immediately changed his attitude and wanted to marry Murong Qi Qi. What kind of world was this?!</p><br/><p>Soul and spirit turned upside down: head over heels</p><br/><p>At this time, in Murong Qing Lian\u2019s heart, Murong Qi Qi was a wreck. Before, when she saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s appearance, Murong Qing Lian was stunned. She didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi would have such masterpiece of a face. She was completely defeated.</p><br/><p>Plus, the fact that the two man who are connected to her were asking for Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand, Murong Qing Lian\u2019s hate for Murong Qi Qi became stronger. Not to mention that Murong Tai died indirectly at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands. She couldn\u2019t not avenge this!</p><br/><p>The two asked to marry Murong Qi Qi at the same time. Wanyan Lie\u2019s expression immediately turned bad. How could he not know what these two were thinking? They actually saw Murong Qi Qi as the tool for the power struggle. Wanyan Lie couldn\u2019t tolerate this and would also not allow it!</p><br/><p>\u201cToo many things happened today. Zhen5 think it\u2019s better to wait till Qi Qi restored her mood. No hurry, don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>A \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019 dispatched Longze Jing Tian and Wanyan Hong and also let consort De, Lin Ke Xin be relieved. Exactly! Now, Murong Qi Qi is a golden cake. Everyone wants her! However, only her Yi er is worthy of Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan got headache because of this series of occurrence. She let Qing Gu support her back to Jinxuan palace. Longze Jing Tian saw that Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t accept his proposal. He also understood his (WL) current thoughts. He asked to take Murong Tai\u2019s and Li Qiu Shui\u2019s body away.</p><br/><p>Although Wanyan Lie truly wanted to throw Li Qiu Shui\u2019s body outside the suburbs to feed dogs, but since Longze Jing Tian asked, he couldn\u2019t let him (LJT) lost face. Besides, they were only corpses. Why be angry at a corpse?! So, he nodded and agreed.</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi returned to Nan Lin wangfu6, Wanyan Lie\u2019s imperial edict had already been decreed; bestowing Murong Qi Qi the title of princess Zhen Guo. When this news reached the wangfu, the whole wangfu exploded.</p><br/><p>Princess Zhen Guo means Guarding Country princess and is the highest rank of princesses e.g. princess of first rank.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy was it like this? Why did wangfei become princess Zhen Guo?\u201d Just as everyone was surprised, Feng Cang came down the carriage while holding Murong Qi Qi. When Feng Qi saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s appearance, his mouth was wide open, \u201cPrincess\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This \u2018princess\u2019 from Feng Qi let everyone\u2019s gaze fell on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face. These were the old people of wangfu. They served Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue. Now, seeing a girl with the same appearance as Wanyan Ming Yue, everyone was stunned with their mouth wide open.</p><br/><p>Only Feng Yu recognized the official robe Murong Qi Qi was wearing. It was the one wangfei wore this morning. It was just, why did Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face change to the same one as Wanyan Ming Yue. This made Feng Yu very surprised, \u201cWangfei, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t want to speak. She only buried her head in Feng Cang\u2019s arms. Seeing her so sad, Feng Cang spoke for her, \u201cIt has been verified. Murong Qi Qi is benwang\u2019s7 biological little sister. She is that daughter of father and mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d The news that came out of Feng Cang\u2019s mouth was truly too horrifying and too scaring. Now, everyone understood why the emperor bestowed Murong Qi Qi the title of princess Zhen Guo.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Su Mei and Su Yue were shocked. They stood there foolishly. They were shocked that Murong Qi Qi revealed her true appearance and her real identity was actually Feng Cang\u2019s little sister. This scared the wits out of the two. How could it be like this? Miss and guye8 were so much in love. How come they entered the palace and returned as siblings?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, then yesterday\u2026\u201d Even Feng Qi who experienced big winds and waves stuttered. One moment, she was wangfei, the next moment she became a princess, is, is the relationship then not messed up? Besides, yesterday wangye and wangfei consummated the marriage, then wouldn\u2019t it be\u2026Feng Qi didn\u2019t want to think about the consequences of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d One sentence summed up the matter of last night. Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi and walked into Tingsong building. The whole way to the wangfu, Murong Qi Qi had been silent. She didn\u2019t even say one word. She didn\u2019t know what to say and didn\u2019t know how to get along with Feng Cang in the future. Before, she was thinking how to keep it a secret. She didn\u2019t expect that today Li Qiu Shui would expose all the truth. So, her thoughts of before, were just her deceiving herself. There was only one truth, but it was so cruel, making her so in pain as not to want to live anymore.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like this, Feng Cang was also very sad. He poured water and brought it to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mouth, \u201cQing Qing, drink some! If you continue to cry like this, my last line of defense would collapse!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, in the future, you can\u2019t call me Qing Qing. You need to call me little sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s tears fell once again. The small face which was originally as big as a palm looked more and more pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s not like this!\u201d Feng Cang couldn\u2019t take it anymore and pulled Murong Qi Qi into his embrace, \u201cQing Qing, it\u2019s not like this! You\u2019re not my little sister. I\u2019m also not your big brother. We aren\u2019t siblings. We aren\u2019t siblings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother\u2026don\u2019t deceive yourself\u2026\u201d Hearing Feng Cang say that, Murong Qi Qi was sadder. \u201cBig brother, we can never be in love\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

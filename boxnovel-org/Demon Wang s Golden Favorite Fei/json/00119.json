And her words let the whole crowd be shocked. So, it was like that\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone was in a huge shock. Wanyan Lie looked full of disbelief at Murong Qi Qi. His gaze was complex\u2026</p><br/><p>Once, he hoped very much for Ming Yue to give birth to a daughter like Ming Yue. Then he would give this child his whole love (not love between man and woman) and let her become the happiest person in this world. It was just, when Li Qiu Shui brought back Ming Yue, Ming Yue\u2019s bulged belly had long flattened.</p><br/><p>He thought that child died and was sad for a long time because of it. However, when Murong Qi Qi was standing so alive in front of him with Ming Yue\u2019s face and Feng Xie\u2019s eyes, Wanyan Lie felt that his dead heart began to beat again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why I named you Qi Qi? Because you were born on the seventh of July! Double seven festival (Chinese valentine), the day the cowherd and the weaving maid meet. Ming Yue used all her strength to give birth to you. She entrusted you to me and wanted to me to bring you back to Bei Zhou and hand you to the empress dowager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi (): (qiqi) is seven seven. </p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, she\u2019s so silly! She actually regarded me as her best friend and thought I would help her achieve her wish, so she could go to the underworld to meet Feng Xie. I won\u2019t let her wish come true! Feng Xie died. I will not let her accompany Feng Xie, because she\u2019s not qualified! So, I took you! I waited for today; waited to have your name go down in history as a byword for infamy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qiu Shui\u2019s voice was with crazy laughter and tears fell from her eyes. She endured for so many years just to wait for today!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so vicious! You even murdered your own daughter!\u201d Murong Qi Qi completely understood everything. A woman, because of hatred caused by love, became so extreme.</p><br/><p>\u201cBah! That child is not my daughter!\u201d Li Qiu Shui turned her head slightly and looked at Murong Qi Qi, \u201cI will only give birth to the child of the man I love, but he didn\u2019t love me and married someone else. So, I made a promise to myself to never give birth to the child of another man. Since I got pregnant, then I could only be ruthless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShui er1, what did you say? You said you truly murdered our child?\u201d A voice came. Murong Tai appeared in front of everyone with an expression of disbelief, \u201cTell me, what you said is not true!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was surprised at seeing Murong Tai. No one expected that Xi Qi\u2019s dignified prime minister would pretend to be Longze Jing Tian\u2019s servant and followed him here. If it wasn\u2019t because he took down the human skin mask on his face, no one would have noticed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou followed me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Tai, aside from surprise, Li Qiu Shui felt anger, \u201cMurong Tai, when have you become like this? You actually followed me? You\u2019re too despicable! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019re such a person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou left in a hurry. I was worried that something would happen to you. That was why I followed you. I didn\u2019t think, you\u2019ll come to Yan capital. Tell me, everything you just said weren\u2019t true! Qi Qi is our child, not Feng Xie\u2019s. Tell me, Qi Qi is our biological daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai clutched Li Qiu Shui\u2019s hand and shook it desperately. He tailed behind her but he had never expected to hear these things. The woman he loved his whole life actually murdered their child. She also said such things. Murong Tai really couldn\u2019t believe it!</p><br/><p>This must be Li Qiu Shui\u2019s angry words. It must be like this! Qi Qi is certainly their child; how would she suddenly become Feng Xie\u2019s and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s child? What had happened for her to say that? Could it be that he did something wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201cShui er, tell them. Tell them you\u2019re lying to them. What you said is not the truth! Qi Qi is my daughter! She\u2019s my daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*** off!\u201d Although injured, but Li Qiu Shui was someone who practiced martial arts and therefore a lot stronger than the weak scholar Murong Tai. With one palm, she pushed Murong Tai to the ground, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me with your filty hands! Making me feel disgusted!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qiu Shui\u2019s words deeply hurt Murong Tai. Even though he\u2019s a man, but Murong Tai\u2019s eyes had a layer of wetness. She felt he\u2019s disgusted? Why was it like this? Could this be the reason why she had been staying in the temple?</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, it\u2019s not true! Tell me, Qi Qi is our child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai\u2019s words were like a joke to Li Qiu Shui. She walked to Murong Tai like a queen. She looked condescending at him. Her eyes were full of contempt, \u201cYou\u2019re only a poor country boy. You only had a good face and your study was so so. Do you think that as Li clan\u2019s eldest miss, I would fancy you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Tai, if it wasn\u2019t because of me and the Li family behind me, you would only be a fallen scholar and would be cultivating and hoeing the field at that poor place of your home. At most, you would be a poor teacher. What could you do? Who do you think you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re a cut above others after putting on the prime minister\u2019s robe? Without me, you\u2019re nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026,\u201d Murong Tai\u2019s lips trmbled. He had never expected that he was so unbearable in Li Qiu Shui\u2019s heart. Although, when Li Qiu Shui picked him, it let him be in fear and excitement for a long time. Murong Tai once thought that marrying Li Qiu Shui was the biggest blessing in his life. However, he never thought that Li Qiu Shui looked at him this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Tai, I tell you, I\u2019ve never ever loved you! Qi Qi is not your daughter and Xue Lian is also not! I don\u2019t love you and also won\u2019t have children for you. I never will! Do you know why every time after you touched me, I would take a bath? You thought that it was because I\u2019m a lady and pay attention to this. I tell you, you\u2019re wrong! I just hate the fact that on my body there\u2019s another man\u2019s smell. Dirty, so dirty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian is Murong Tai\u2019s eldest daughter. The imperial noble consort of Xi Qi. </p><br/><p>This last sentence from Li Qiu Shui truly defeated Murong Tai.</p><br/><p>His long thoughts and memories which lasted for sixteen years, because of this \u2018never will\u2019 from Li Qiu Shui, were broken. So, all those lingering and love from her were a pretence. So, in her heart, she had always thought about Feng Xie and couldn\u2019t put Feng Xie down. So, he was the fool. For so many years, he foolishly waited for her!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t love me, why did you marry me?\u201d This time, Murong Tai\u2019s figure looked very sorry. When Li Qiu Shui told him the truth, his heart had been defeated. In a moment, he seemed to have aged a lot; his face paled and his expression deteriorated.</p><br/><p>At this point, the thing Murong Tai was concerned about, was not his face of being a country\u2019s prime minister. The things that truly hurt him were those heartless and harsh words of Li Qiu Shui and that Li Qiu Shui had never loved him!</p><br/><p>Murong Tai didn\u2019t lose hope and wanted to get to the bottom of it. Li Qiu Shui sneered, \u201cBecause you were docile and obedient, because you didn\u2019t have any background and power. If you wanted to get more powerful, you needed to rely on me. You couldn\u2019t get out of my grasp\u2026and because, you were willing to be my dog; willing to listen to my every call and willing to be manipulated by me! Do\u2026you understand now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang\u2026\u2019 Murong Tai who originally stood up got dizzy. Once again, he fell on the ground. Seeing him being so \u2018useless\u2019, the ridicule and contempt on Li Qiu Shui\u2019s face got more intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, look at you, truly a spineless coward! Since I spoke till here, I may as well tell you. I picked up Xue Lian. She\u2019s not a child I had with you. The moment that child was born, I let people threw her away. I will not give birth to children of the man I don\u2019t love! Especially you! Because you\u2019re not worthy!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the scene, no matter if it was a country\u2019s monarch Wanyan Lie or empress dowager Dongfang Lan, they all had been shocked by Li Qiu Shui\u2019s words. There was actually such a vicious woman, actually\u2026 (Authors note: please allow Rabbit\u2019s loss of vocabulary, Rabbit truly have no way to describe aunt Qiu Shui\u2019s sick mind).</p><br/><p>The author\u2019s penname is Candle Wax Rabbit. She always uses Rabbit to describe herself</p><br/><p>The only one who kept her calm was Murong Qi Qi, the involved party. Murong Qi Qi had never thought that the truth was like this. Looking at the beautiful middle-aged woman dressed in black clothes on the scene, Murong Qi Qi walked step by step to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you loved Feng Xie and couldn\u2019t get his love, that was why you planned all of these? That was why, before I married, you told me to get pregnant quickly and also put aphrodisiac fragrance on the wedding dress?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou found out?\u201d Li Qiu Shui chuckled at Murong Qi Qi cleverness, \u201cHowever, it seemed that you discovered too late! Now, it\u2019s too late! I heard you consummated the marriage with Feng Cang yesterday, hahahaha\u2026hahahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy! I\u2019ve never been so happy before! If Wanyan Ming Yue knew her daughter and son married and consummated the marriage, would she jump out of the coffin from anger?! Would she not be peaceful in the afterlife? This is the price for taking away the man I love! Hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Li Qiu Shui\u2019s words, Dongfang Lan became dizzy and almost fainted. Qing Gu quickly lent her an arm of support, \u201cEmpress dowager, empress dowager, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026,\u201d A breath choked in Dongfang Lan\u2019s heart. The breath couldn\u2019t go up nor down.</p><br/><p>Just the thought of the redness on the handkerchief, Dongfang Lan almost fainted. Heavens, what did she do so wrong to receive such punishment?! Her daughter and son-in-law died a tragic death; the wife her grandson married is actually her biological granddaughter. No matter who, when they receive such news, no one would be able to bear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother!\u201d Seeing Dongfang Lan like that, Murong Qi Qi went forward to support her. Her small hands were on the elder\u2019s back. A warmth appeared through Dongfang Lan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>After a while, Dongfang Lan was able to breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi\u2026\u201d Dongfang Lan held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand. Her tears fell. \u201cNo wonder aijia2 felt that you looked familiar. No wonder aijia felt your eyes looked like someone I knew and felt close to you. What aijia didn\u2019t expect is that you\u2019re my biological granddaughter. My pitiful child, ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s tears let Li Qiu Shui be greatly satisfied. Her mouth was raised in an exaggerated ridiculing arc. She stared at Dongfang Lan who was crying in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s arms, \u201cI heard you consummated the marriage. Hahaha. Congratulations! You\u2019re the first couple in this world, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Wanyan Lie roared and interrupted Li Qiu Shui. Such a result was truly outside of his expectations. Murong Qi Qi is actually Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s daughter and is his niece. Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart was couldn\u2019t bear it. Now, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi even\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up? What I said is the truth! Could it be that if I don\u2019t say it, this matter wouldn\u2019t exist?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessarily\u2026\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s was cool with a trace of chilliness.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the one who spoke was Feng Cang who remained silent for a long time, Li Qiu Shui was happy, \u201cWhat, do you dare to say that between you there\u2019s no feelings? Do you dare to say that nothing happened between you? Do you dare to say that you didn\u2019t consummate the marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint you. Last night, benwang3 didn\u2019t feel well and couldn\u2019t consummate the marriage. The thing on the handkerchief is the blood benwang got from a pigeon and isn\u2019t like what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Several people said this at the same time. It was different people, but all of their voices revealed a trace happiness from being surprised. Among them was Longze Jing Tian and Wanyan Hong.</p><br/><p>Long, when Murong Qi Qi took down the Water Moon Mirror, Longze Jing Tian recognized her\u2026Du Xian Er.</p><br/><p>The woman he had been searching for was in fact in front of him. Besides, he also fell in love with the ordinary her. This made Longze Jing Tian couldn\u2019t help but to exclaim in admiration at the fate of this world. It turned out that Murong Qi Qi is truly Du Xian Er. She actually played him and toyed with him in the palm of her hand. He almost missed her!</p><br/><p>Just now, Longze Jing Tian had been carefully recalling when he had offended Murong Qi Qi. In the end, he finally remembered. It was when they met the first time; after she saved him, he said that he needed to break off the engagement and get rid of that rubbish of the prime minister\u2019s. Presumably, she must\u2019ve heard this and got revenge on him like this!</p><br/><p>Just now, when he saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s true appearance, Longze Jing Tian almost stopped breathing. That day, it was night. Under the moonlight, she was like a pure lily. Today, wearing a red palace robe, she was like a rose with thorns, making people unable to stop themselves from loving her. Just now, when he listened to Li Qiu Shui, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart almost went up his throat.</p><br/><p>He was even thinking about how to protect Murong Qi Qi if she is Feng Cang\u2019s biological little sister and something truly happened between them. Was it to kill Li Qiu Shui to cover this scandal, then take the opportunity to show Wanyan Lie his desire for a marriage alliance and marry Murong Qi Qi or\u2026</p><br/><p>Now Feng Cang said that nothing happened between them. The blood on that handkerchief was a pigeon\u2019s. Longze Jing Tian\u2019s heart almost jumped out of his throat. Was this a gift and blessing from the heavens? To let him regain his lost treasure again? To let him have the opportunity again to get Murong Qi Qi?</p><br/><p>Compared to Longze Jing Tian, Wanyan Hong\u2019s eyes showed desire.</p><br/><p>Little aunt Wanyan Ming Yue was once the number one beauty of the world. Her appearance and smiling face deeply engraved in the younger Wanyan Hong\u2019s heart. Even after adulthood, he often dreamed about little aunt. Now, seeing Murong Qi Qi; she was even more beautiful than Wanyan Ming Yue. Wanyan Hong\u2019s heart beat very fast. He had long thrown the matter of Murong Qing Lian to the clouds.</p><br/><p>Emperor father pampered Feng Cang so much. After getting to know Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity, he would certainly pamper Murong Qi Qi more. Would emperor father love the house and its crow and would also pay more attention to him, this crown prince? Then, wouldn\u2019t Feng Cang also not come steal the throne from him?</p><br/><p>Love the house and its crow: love me, love all that come with me. Love me, love my dog.</p><br/><p>The ones who were truly happy was only Dongfang Lan and Wanyan Lie. That nothing happened between Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi meant that this wouldn\u2019t hurt these two children\u2019s reputation and they wouldn\u2019t be hurt mentally and physically by this. Of course, this was a great thing, ah!</p><br/><p>As for Wanyan Lie, his mood was complicated. Finding the long-lost niece let Wanyan Lie feel a never before anticipation. It was like a dry river encountering rain. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s appearance now was like that of Wanyan Ming Yue before she married; clean, innocent, making his old heart beat very fast.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue, is it that you finally understood my heart? That was why you send Qi Qi? Ming Yue, I would definitely take good care of Qi Qi. I would give her the best things in the world. I would give her this whole world. I would let her become the most respectable and precious woman of this world!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s happiness fell into empress and consort De\u2019s eyes. The two silently shouted \u2018bad\u2019.</p><br/><p>Because of Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s sake, Wanyan Lie particularly favored Feng Cang. Now, there\u2019s a Murong Qi Qi. Then wouldn\u2019t Feng family get all the benefits? How could this be right?! Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang\u2019s relationship was originally very good. If this woman knew how to play tricks and let Wanyan Lie pass the throne to Feng Cang, which was not impossible for Wanyan Lie to do\u2026</p><br/><p>What to do? The two women\u2019s first reaction was to consider the matter of their sons getting the throne. After Li Bing saw the way Wanyan Hong looked at Murong Qi Qi, she immediately understood what her son wanted.</p><br/><p>If Murong Qi Qi truly was Wanyan Ming Yue and Feng Xie\u2019s daughter, well, she\u2019s at a marriageable age. Promising her to Wanyan Hong is the best! Like that, they could use Wanyan Lie\u2019s love for Murong Qi Qi to consolidate Wanyan Hong\u2019s status!</p><br/><p>How could Lin Ke Xin not understand this pair of mother and son\u2019s thoughts?! These two thought beautifully. Now, they didn\u2019t even know if Murong Qi Qi is truly princess Ming Yue\u2019s daughter. If she is, Wanyan Hong already has a crown princess. Only her Wanyan Yi didn\u2019t have a main consort. Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t even have a cefei4. Murong Qi Qi would certainly be her daughter-in-law.</p><br/><p>The matter wasn\u2019t made clear yet, the people on the scene were already thinking how to compete for Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>The moment Li Qiu Shui heard Feng Cang say that nothing happened on the wedding night, she didn\u2019t believe it, \u201cHumph, Nan Lin wang\u2019s 5 reaction is quick, ah! Now, you say this; do you take us as fools? Do you think I would believe it? With a delicate as flower and refined as a precious jade woman at your side, besides she is the one you love, you won\u2019t be moved?\u201d</p><br/><p>Delicate as flower and refined as a precious: exquisite woman</p><br/><p>Li Qiu Shui didn\u2019t believe it. Murong Qi Qi was too lazy to explain. She took a dagger and cut of the sleeve of her left arm and revealed the red gecko cinnabar mark. Seeing the gecko cinnabar mark, Li Qiu Shui couldn\u2019t close her mouth, \u201cHow could this be? How could this be? Impossible!\u201d Li Qiu Shui wanted to rush over to take a look, but had been pushed away with one palm by Feng Cang. Then, Feng Cang\u2019s coat draped over Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for letting your plan come to nothing!\u201d Seeing the stunned expression of Li Qiu Shui, Murong Qi Qi humphed coldly once, \u201cSince you said that you took me away from my mother princess Ming Yue, then where\u2019s princess Ming Yue? Didn\u2019t she burn to death with my father Feng Xie? Could it be that the person who died wasn\u2019t her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Fairy</p><br/><p>There once was a young, poor, but kind-hearted cowherd called Niulang, and an old ox. The ox actually was once the god of cattle, but downgraded as he had violated the law of heaven. Niulang once saved the ox when it was sick. In order to show its gratitude, the old ox helped Niulang get acquainted with Zhin\u00fc (a fairy, the seventh daughter of a goddess and the Jade Emperor) when she escaped from her boring life in heaven to look for fun on earth.</p><br/><p>Zhin\u00fc soon fell in love with Niulang and they got married without the knowledge of the goddess. Niulang and Zhin\u00fc lived a happy life together; Niulang worked in the field while Zhin\u00fc did weaving at home. After a few years passed, they had two children, one boy and one girl.</p><br/><p>However, the Goddess of Heaven (Zhin\u00fc\u2019s mother) found out that Zhin\u00fc, a fairy girl, had married a mere mortal. The goddess was furious and sent celestial soldiers to bring Zhin\u00fc back. Niulang was very upset when he found his wife was taken back to heaven. Then his ox asked Niulang to kill it and put on its hide, so he would be able to go up to heaven to find his wife. Crying bitterly, he killed the ox, put on the skin, and carried his two beloved children off to heaven to find Zhin\u00fc.</p><br/><p>Just before he caught up with Zhin\u00fc, the goddess of heaven took out her hairpin and created a huge river between them, and they were separated forever by the river that later became known as the Milky Way.</p><br/><p>Heartbroken, he and his children could only weep bitterly. However, their love moved all the magpies to take pity on them, and they flew up into heaven to form a bridge over the river, so Niulang and Zhin\u00fc could meet on the magpie bridge. The goddess was also moved by their love, so she allowed them a meeting on the magpie bridge on that day every year (the seventh day of the seventh lunar month).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

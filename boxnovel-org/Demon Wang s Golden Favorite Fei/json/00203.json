How could Gu De accept that such a thing happened to his daughter? \u201cChief, we didn\u2019t find Longze Jing Tian during the search of the mountain. This indicates two possibilities. One is that Longze Jing Tian is gone, and the other is that someone has hidden him somewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean, there\u2019s a traitor in our tribe?\u201d How couldn\u2019t Gu De understand the meaning of Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words? But to say that the Qiang tribe had traitors and had hidden Longze Jing Tian, Gu De couldn\u2019t believe this. However, the truth was in front of him and made it impossible for him to not believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Who is it that has such big gut to actually do such a thing?!\u201d Even though Gu De usually looked gentle, but once it involved his only daughter, his bad temper immediately came up. \u201cInvestigate! Must investigate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I have a suggestion. Don\u2019t know what you think about it.\u201d Feng Qi Qi whispered her thoughts to Gu De. As soon as Gu De heard it, he nodded repeatedly. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right! Since their targets are you and the regent. It\u2019s indeed possible to do so. However, I\u2019m worried that Longze Jing Tian is a madman and will hurt you two and the child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s scheme was called \u2018draw the snake out of its hole\u2019. The purpose that Longze Jing Tian came here was nothing more than to retaliate her and Feng Cang. In this case, they must be looking for an appropriate opportunity. Since Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang were Longze Jing Tian\u2019s targets, so let them (FC&amp;FQQ) be the bait to bring out these \u2018snakes\u2019 which were hidden in the dark!</p><br/><p>Draw the snake out its hole: lure the target to appear.</p><br/><p>The people of Qiang tribe were relieved that Gu Yun Wan was successfully found. Jin Mo and Feng Qi Qi discussed the method of treatment for Gu Yun Wan, by relying mainly on the acupuncture of Jin Mo with Feng Qi Qi\u2019s massage as support. The mood of Gu Yun Wan was also calmed down. It didn\u2019t take long for her to restore to the former strong girl and began to cooperate with the treatment of Jin Mo.</p><br/><p>Looking for Gu Yun Wan had delayed some time. So when Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang went to the top of the White Bird mountain the next day. Ah Zha and Ming Yue Zheng had long been waiting there.</p><br/><p>When Ah Zha did the demonstration previously, Feng Qi Qi kind of got a grasp on elder Teng Yuan\u2019s spell and intended to experiment it today.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me do it!\u201d After hearing Feng Qi Qi\u2019s thoughts, Ah Zha took the initiative to cooperate with Feng Qi Qi. \u201cI have been through it many times, let me try it first, this way the success rate will also be much higher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang shook his head and refused Ah Zha\u2019s suggestion directly. Feng Qi Qi simply wanted to try it. It still needed to be examined if she really got the hang of the spell of Elder Teng Yuan. If not, wouldn\u2019t both feet of Ah Zha\u2019s become disabled when he stepped on the hot charcoal? This kind of thing shouldn\u2019t be done by other people.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me do it!\u201d Feng Cang stood up. His words made Ah Zha frown, \u201cThe regent doesn\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that! I\u2019m just afraid that something might happen to you. After all, Qing Qing isn\u2019t so sure about it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you two don\u2019t take me as a friend?\u201d Ah Zha was even more unhappy, \u201cMy skin and flesh are thick. Even if there is something, it will recover soon. The third test is to enter the dragon pool. If you hurt your foot, how do you get into the water? Don\u2019t you want to cure little shizi\u2019s1 gu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to! I want to cure Xiao er\u2019s2 gu more than anyone else. But I also don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt because of our matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi had already told Feng Cang about the matter regarding Gu Yun Wan. As soon as he thought of that once healthy and lively girl might become disabled, Feng Cang gnashed his teeth and would hate Longze Jing Tian and the others so much. No matter what kind of grudges they had against each other, please don\u2019t harm the innocent! If someone was injured because of curing Feng Xiao\u2019s gu, how could Feng Cang not feel guilty?</p><br/><p>Gnashing teeth: displaying extreme anger or frustration.</p><br/><p>Ah Zha still wanted to persist but was stopped by Ming Yue Cheng, \u201cCousin Ah Zha, since Feng Cang has made a decision, we should support it. I trust Qi Qi\u2019s abilities. They pairing up should be no problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng was also not sure. Although Feng Qi Qi could read lips and understood elder Teng Yuan\u2019s spell, but after all, it was a charcoal that was burning hot. People are made of flesh and blood. What if there was any mistake, those feet might really get disabled.</p><br/><p>If Feng Cang didn\u2019t interrupt, he (MYC) was willing to try it. But Ming Yue Cheng knew that the matter with Gu Yun Wan had caused invisible pressure on this couple. If Ah Zha hurt his feet, they would definitely feel guilty about it.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi also supported Feng Cang\u2019s decision. They only came here to cure Feng Xiao\u2019s gu. She didn\u2019t expect that Longze Jing Tian and the others would actually follow them and even injured Gu Yun Wan. Although Gu Yun Wan\u2019s legs could be treated. It just needed some time, but it wasn\u2019t a matter that made people relaxed after all. She also didn\u2019t want anyone to be hurt anymore because of their matters.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang, look at the copper coin in my hand.\u201d Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang looked at each other. Different from elder Teng Yuan, Feng Qi Qi had a copper coin tied up with a string in her hand. Just saw Feng Qi Qi\u2019s mouth slightly open while Feng Cang\u2019s eyes were fixed on the copper coin. In just a moment, the eyes became cold and empty.</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018spell\u2019 was only a kind of hypnosis. The power of mental cues was endless. It was only used during the hypnosis to let Feng Cang enter a frozen state. He wouldn\u2019t feel any heat then.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Feng Qi Qi said softly. Feng Cang turned and stepped onto the fire.</p><br/><p>Out of safety, Feng Cang wore a pair of ice silk socks on both feet. The ice silk had insulated effect. Even if he stepped on the fire, he would only feel warm and wouldn\u2019t burn his feet. With this layer of protection and also Feng Qi Qi\u2019s spell, it was double protection. In just a moment, Feng Cang passed through the burning coals.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d After removing the hypnosis, Feng Qi Qi quickly checked the feet of Feng Cang. There were no blisters and no injuries!</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d Feng Cang shook his head. \u201cIs it because of the ice silk? Shall I try with my bare feet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Feng Qi Qi nodded and hypnotized Feng Cang again.</p><br/><p>This time, Feng Qi Qi had her heart into her throat. Without the protection of the ice silk, could Feng Cang really pass the sea of flames? Although she used to do a lot of things with hypnosis in her previous life, but this time, she was still very worried. After all, Feng Cang\u2019s feet were on hot burning charcoal, what if\u2026.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Feng Qi Qi to finish worrying, Feng Cang had successfully passed through the sea of flames once again. There was no what if, everything went well\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, you\u2019re so amazing!\u201d Ah Zha looked stunned at the side. Only the elders could do the spell. How could Feng Qi Qi learn it after she only had seen it once? \u201cPrincess, are you sure you\u2019re not from our Qiang tribe?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of Ah Zha made Feng Qi Qi smiled slightly, \u201cWarrior Ah Zha, I\u2019m certain I\u2019m a Bei Zhou\u2019s citizen and have no relationship with the Qiang tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Feng Qi Qi said this, Ah Zha could only exclaim in admiration repeatedly, \u201cPrincess is really a genius, amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The news that Feng Cang could pass through the sea of flames was soon spread throughout the village. After hearing that it was the credit of Feng Qi Qi and that she had unraveled the spell for \u2018through the sea of flames\u2019, elder Teng Yuan was surprised. How could this be? He just demonstrated it once. How did Feng Qi Qi learn it already?</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected she isn\u2019t easy to deal with!\u201d While elder Teng Yuan was surprised, the peculiar voice of Taji Guli came over, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Feng Qi Qi to be really able to do it! Elder Teng Yuan, it mustn\u2019t be that you changed your mind?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listen to Taji Guli mentioned Feng Qi Qi, elder Teng Yuan couldn\u2019t help but thought of what Feng Qi Qi had said before. The Immortal cream was an addictive poison, and now he was already poisoned.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Teng Yuan, elder Teng Yuan?\u201d Seeing that elder Teng Yuan didn\u2019t speak, Taji Guli came forward and touched him with the hook of her left hand, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys kidnap great miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be us?! We won\u2019t do such a thing!\u201d Taji Guli quickly denied. Duyi also stepped forward and lit the tobacco for Elder Teng Yuan, \u201cEven if we are dissatisfied with Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi, we won\u2019t make an enemy out of the Qiang tribe. Elder must believe in our sincerity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Teng Yuan originally had doubts, but the smell of the Immortal cream had already been spreading. After he impatiently smoked from the mouthpiece of the pipe tobacco twice, he tossed the matter of a moment ago beyond the topmost clouds.</p><br/><p>Beyond the topmost clouds: unimaginably far away.</p><br/><p>After seeing elder Teng Yuan like this, Taji Guli and Duyi looked at each other and smiled. It seemed that he had been indulged in the Immortal cream and was unable to extricate himself from it. In the future, he (TY) could only be manipulated by them (TGL &amp; DY).</p><br/><p>Finally, it was the day to go through the sea of flames. After the Qiang tribe\u2019s young and old had seen Feng Cang mount the mountain of daggers, they had greatly improved their impression of the regent from Bei Zhou. He (FC) was the first foreigner who could mount the mountain of daggers. Since ancient times, the Qiang tribe had worshipped warriors. Feng Cang had already been classifies as a half warrior.</p><br/><p>On this day, the weather was clear. In the early morning, someone set the wood on fire. In just a moment, thick smoke surged on the field. After the smoke was dispersed, only pieces of burning red charcoal were left.</p><br/><p>One already heard that Feng Cang could \u2018go through the sea of flames\u2019. Everyone who came today wanted to see the miracle. As expected, after the hypnosis of Feng Qi Qi, Feng Cang walked barefoot through the ten-meter-long \u2018sea of flames\u2019. When Feng Cang reached the ground, sound of cheers was heard.</p><br/><p>The elders who came to watch were all astonished at this, especially elder Teng Yuan. It was one thing to hear, but seeing with his own eyes was another thing. The shock that Feng Qi Qi brought to elder Teng Yuan was so great that he couldn\u2019t help but stare at Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you do it? Our spell are never divulged to outsiders!\u201d Elder Teng Yuan stared at Feng Qi Qi. He knew that Feng Cang could pass, was thanks to those repeatedly murmured words of Feng Qi Qi at the beginning. Could it be that she secretly learned their spell? But why was there a string with a copper coin in her hand, which was somewhat different from the spell of the Qiang tribe? This was the most confusing part to elder Teng Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder wants to now? This is our Feng family\u2019s secret technique!\u201d Feng Qi Qi could see the dejection and deterioration from the face of elder Teng Yuan. It seemed that this Elder had been deeply addicted to drugs. \u201cIt seems that elder didn\u2019t follow my advice and still took the Immortal cream. Is elder really not afraid of death?\u201d</p><br/><p>The seriousness in the eyes of Feng Qi Qi made elder Teng Yuan\u2019s heart tighten all of a sudden. Although Longze Jing Tian and the others didn\u2019t admit that they kidnapped Gu Yun Wan, but when they rushed to his home for help that night, he should already see it coming that they did something unspeakable. The culprits who kidnapped Gu Yan Wan were absolutely Longze Jing Tian, those three people.</p><br/><p>If he was caught in conspiracy with outsiders, he would surely be ridiculed by the Qiang tribe\u2019s people. Maybe even be expelled from the Qiang tribe. What should he do? He lived here for his whole life. If by any chance, he was expelled from the White Bird mountain because of those three people. Then wouldn\u2019t he be a falling leaf that is unable to return to the roots when he died?</p><br/><p>A falling leaf returns to the roots: returns home, go back to one\u2019s roots</p><br/><p>The face of elder Teng Yuan was extremely ugly, and his voice became lower, \u201cDo you have any way to get rid of my addiction?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Teng Yuan said it like this made Feng Qi Qi certain that this opium was really given to him by someone. But what was the purpose?</p><br/><p>\u201cI can help you, but the process of quitting the drug is long. It has many obstacles that ordinary people can\u2019t bear. Although the drug addiction of elder isn\u2019t serious. However, if you continue in this way, it\u2019s difficult to guarantee that you won\u2019t die from opium.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOpium? So the Immortal cream is actually called this name.\u201d Elder Teng Yuan was a bit hesitant. He could hear the truth in Feng Qi Qi\u2019s words. Recently, in the tribe, he also heard a lot of things about Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi. The people of the tribe all praised them. Feng Qi Qi wouldn\u2019t deceive people, and there was no need to deceive him.</p><br/><p>However, when he thought about the happiness that the Immortal cream brought to him, elder Teng Yuan wanted to yawn.</p><br/><p>\u201cYawning repeatedly, tears welling up. Elder, do you want to take the immortal cream?\u201d Feng Qi Qi saw that elder Teng Yuan wasn\u2019t right. She pulled out a silver needle from her hand and put it into Elder Teng Yuan\u2019s temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what are you doing?\u201d It was painful. So, elder Teng Yuan wanted to pull out the silver needle, but was stopped by Feng Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave you! Help you to suppress drug addiction! Elder doesn\u2019t want to be controlled by opium and without the freedom to act independently, and finally betray yourself right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi didn\u2019t know that the person who gave Elder Teng Yuan the Immortal cream was Duyi. She just thought that using opium to manipulate the elders of Qiang tribe must be sinister. However, her words happened to touch the sensitive spot of elder Teng Yuan. He snorted, and pulled out the silver needle and threw it to Feng Qi Qi, \u201cDon\u2019t go speculate on others, I hate such self-righteous people the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Teng Yuan swung his sleeve and walked furiously away. As if someone was chasing behind him, and soon he disappeared.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang successfully passed the two tests \u2018mountain of daggers and sea of flames\u2019, not only made the people of Qiang tribe amazed. They particularly worshipped this regent from Bei Zhou and even gave him a title of warrior. If Feng Cang could pass the third test, then he was a hero thoroughly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFour days later, enter dragon pool! If the regent can pass this last test, we will certainly get rid of the gu poison of little shizi!\u201d When Gu De announced the news, the people on the field applauded and cheered for Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi. The interaction of these days made them already acknowledge these people from Bei Zhou. They were very fond of Feng Cang and the others, and sincerely hoped that Feng Cang could successfully pass the third test.</p><br/><p>After returning to the residence, Jin Mo took out Nalan Xin\u2019s confidential letter and handed it to Feng Cang. \u201cThere\u2019s a situation at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d Wanyan Kang who was at the side, heard it and immediately came over.</p><br/><p>After Feng Cang read the letter, he handed it to Wanyan Kang. When he (WK) finished reading the contents of the letter, Wanyan Kang shout out, \u201cWanyan Hong is really shameless. He actually resurfaced again. What the hell?! Even more, he wants to fight with his son over the throne. He really have no shame!\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that Wanyan Hong launched a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat with the support of the prime minister. However, there were Dongfang Lan and Feng Xie. In addition, Nalan Xin and Su Yue also stayed in Yan capital. His (WH) restoration hadn\u2019t begun yet, but was already discovered. Now, DongFang Lan had sent a letter and asked Feng Cang how to deal with this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, Wanyan Hong really never change. It\u2019s better to \u2018kacha\u2019 him!\u201d</p><br/><p>What Wanyan Kang\u2019s \u2018kacha\u2019 meant, was to kill him (WH) to avoid later troubles. Anyhow, he (WH) was the biological father of Wanyan Jie. If Wanyan Jie wasn\u2019t the emperor, there was no need to keep the life of Wanyan Hong. However, there was a blood relationship between them. He (FC) was afraid that the title of killing biological father wouldn\u2019t be good for Wanyan Jie.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think, it\u2019s better to let him die of an illness.\u201d Feng Cang didn\u2019t speak out. Feng Qi Qi knew his (FC) inner thoughts. He (FC) was considering the reputation of Wanyan Jie in the future. So she said her opinion, \u201cPeople get sick, drag for a year and a half, he will eventually die. This way, it won\u2019t make things difficult for Jie er in the future\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2019s thoughts is the same as what I thought. If ordering to kill Wanyan Hong. Jie er is still young, so it will leave a mark in his heart. Just follow what Qing Qing said!\u201d</p><br/><p>Previously, they were already wary of possible changes in Bei Zhou. Feng Cang had made people to watch the movements of the court\u2019s officials carefully. He didn\u2019t expect to actually have caught them. After this incident, Bei Zhou was now really settled down and entered a stage of stable development.</p><br/><p>The news of Feng Cang had passed the second test and only the third test remained, was passed on Longze Jing Tian and the others by elder Teng Yuan. As soon as Longze Jing Tian heard that Feng Cang would enter the dragon pool, he slightly furrowed. This was an opportunity and Longze Jing Tian was waiting for this opportunity.</p><br/><p>1.

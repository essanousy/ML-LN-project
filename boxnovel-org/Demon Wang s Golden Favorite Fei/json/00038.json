He quickly said two times \u201cdon\u2019t dare\u201d before he retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cServants!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian snapped. Two people in black appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo get Murong Xin Lian for benwang2!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian was anxiously waiting for the result. The medicine should take effect soon! It\u2019s only common sense that Longze Jing Tian\u2019s guards would come to get her, the only woman in the wangfu3. But why was she kept waiting for so long, there still hasn\u2019t been any movement?!</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian was in deep thoughts that she didn\u2019t even notice the two people who had appeared at her back. A muffled sound could be heard, Murong Xin Lian became limp in one of the people in black\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Lu Ye was now so hot that he had become irrational. Longze Jing Tian and Lu Yuan put Lu Ye on the bed. After seeing Murong Xin Lian in the bed, Lu Yuan was shocked: \u201cWangye, this\u2026 \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of this is done by this bitch! Let her do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian stopped Lu Yuan and pulled down the curtains. No matter how much Murong Xin Lian screamed from pain inside the curtains, Longze Jing Tian remained unmoved. And Lu Yuan, after knowing what Murong Xin Lian had done, his impression of her directly hit the bottom and now thought she was shameful.</p><br/><p>After one night, Murong Xin Lian had been tormented half to death. After that, she was thrown back to her place by Longze Jing Tian\u2019s guards. When Murong Xin Lian woke up, the pain, along with those green and purple places on her body, made her jump for joy.</p><br/><p>Was it Longze Jing Tian who came over? Was the man from last night him? Then, will she get pregnant? Murong Xin Lian stroked her belly. Although her body\u2019s in pain, but in her heart, she\u2019s happy. At least, she got what she wanted.</p><br/><p>After hearing people report Murong Xin Lian\u2019s condition, Longze Jing Tian revealed a mocking smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, won\u2019t you give her soup for not having children\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Yuan was worried. It would be bad if Murong Xin Lian becomes pregnant. It wouldn\u2019t be good for wangye\u2019s reputation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian shook his finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this is her wish, why not fulfill it? What bennwang wants to see most is the expression of those greedy people when their dream is shattered! Let people serve ce wangfei4 well. No matter if it\u2019s things to use or to eat, give her the best. Benwang wants her to fall until all bones are broken!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the cruel smile on Longze Jing Tian\u2019s face, Lu Yuan knew that this wangye was really being ruthless.</p><br/><p>But this was what she asked for herself. His own little brother Lu Ye was still unconscious in bed. The imperial physician said that the medicine was too strong, Lu Ye had hurt his body. He needed to rest well. All of this was thanks to Murong Xin Lian!</p><br/><p>In one month, Murong Xin Lian got the best of care. The whole wangfu was treating her as the female master, letting Murong Xin Lian\u2019s pride become greatly satisfied.</p><br/><p>Aside from Longze Jing Tian not allowing her to go into the study and also never coming over to her place, the other things made Murong Xin Lian very content.</p><br/><p>As for Longze Jing Tian, Murong Xin Lian admits that she used tricks and made him angry, but Murong Xin Lian was sure that he had feelings for her. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have let people treat her like this.</p><br/><p>Besides, Murong Xin Lian already has a card in her hand. Her period hadn\u2019t come this month. Let the heavens bless her with a child. Maybe she can then use this child. By then, she would be a step closer to the position of wangfei5</p><br/><p>Finally, September arrived. Bei Zhou\u2019s Nan Lin wang Feng Cang arrived at the capital after a month and a half trip.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang, all has been arranged. On the ninth of September, Longze Yu will hold a banquet. At that time, you can see wangfei.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ru Yi helped Feng Cang put on clothes and then helped him comb his hair.</p><br/><p>After they finished dressing, Feng Cang drank medicine. The first thing he asked about was the banquet at the palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the dress for wangfei ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>For almost two months, Feng Cang restrained the impulse to go see Murong Qi Qi. He had been quietly recuperating at the house located outside the capital. The so-called trip to Xi Qi was just a pretext. No one knew that he had long arrived at Xi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll is ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang clapped. Immediately, ten female servants appeared. In everyone\u2019s hands, there\u2019s a dress for Feng Cang to choose. With just a glance, Feng Cang frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDismissed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just with one look, Ji Xiang knew that her master isn\u2019t satisfied. She immediately let them retreat with the clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre those the dresses you chose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice was very gentle, but it made Ji Xiang shudder. She immediately knelt down: \u201cWangye, don\u2019t be angry. This slave admits the mistake!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang put a candied fruit in his mouth and sipped carefully. He didn\u2019t let Ji Xiang get up. His finger gently tapped on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that in Xi Liang, a \u2018Jue Se Fang\u2019 has opened. Let\u2019s go take a look. Perhaps there will be a surprise\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ru Yi stood to one side. He didn\u2019t dare to plead for his twin sister. He could only helplessly look at Ji Xiang once and escorted Feng Cang away.</p><br/><p>Jue Se Fang, one of Guang Hua gongzi\u2019s6 shop. It originally opened at Nan Feng country. Now, it has opened a branch in Xi Liang, Xi Qi\u2019s capital. Just a banner would\u2019ve attracted a lot of people to watch. It wasn\u2019t even open yet, but has already caused a sensation.</p><br/><p>Everyone knows that Guang Hua gongzi\u2019s Tong Bao Zhai is dedicated to creating jewelries and Jue Se Fang\u2019s clothes were famous in the world.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s rumored that Nan Feng country\u2019s imperial noble consort He Lan Min loves Jue Se Fang\u2019s dresses. After Jue Se Fang arrived, He Lan Min no longer wore anything embroidered in the palace. She only wore something from Jue Se Fang. And because of this imperial noble consort\u2019s respect, it made Jue Se Fang\u2019s fame reach an unparalleled height.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, our shop will open at the ninth of September!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper of Jue Se Fang, Fang Tong, had eyes in the shape of green beans. He looked smart with a little cunning and deceitfulness.</p><br/><p>Looking at Feng Cang who\u2019s dressed in white with a gauze hat, Fang Tong warmly served tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, take a look. If there\u2019s something pleasing to the eye, you can place an order.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Feng Cang opened his mouth, Fang Tong was surprised. Then he immediately smiled: \u201cTake your time in looking. If you have the need, call the customer service personnel. They will answer you with the most detailed answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer service personnel?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were very fresh\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Feng Cang looked at the store. Have to say Jue Se Fang is a unique shop. No need to say about those beautiful gorgeous clothes, but those life-size models made from wood carving made people admire Guang Hua gongzi\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Clothes just hanging there are dead. When dressed on a model, they became alive. And there\u2019s also those customer service personnel, who were full of smiles. They\u2019re dressed very finely. Even if they were dressed the same, but the nuances on the collar and cuffs was enough to help people realize their differences.</p><br/><p>Fang Tong hurried to the back and opened a door. After he went in, he shut the door. Seeing Murong Qi Qi inside, Fang Tong respectably knelt on one knee.</p><br/><p>\u201cRise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi leisurely watched the scenery outside the window. Su Yue and Su Mei were standing at the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, a precious guest arrived downstairs. It seems he is the future guye7.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong cautiously glanced at Murong Qi Qi. Nicknamed \u2018preternaturally good hearing\u2019, Fang Tong\u2019s ears were the best in Moyu. He only needed to hear a voice one time; he would never forget it again. A few years in the past, Fang Tong went to Bei Zhou and saw Feng Cang. So that\u2019s why the moment Feng Cang opened his mouth, just a \u2018good\u2019 and Feng Tong already knew his identity.</p><br/><p>1. Wangye/ wang: prince of the first rank</p><br/><p>2.

She didn\u2019t expect that the two would stay quiet for a few days and were now again not well-behaved. Today, Feng Cang went out of the city to inspect the venue for the tournament of the four countries. The moment he left, the two came over. Really clever.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, it\u2019s so cold. Don\u2019t go out! They are a weasel paying a New Year call to a chicken, with no good intentions!\u201d</p><br/><p>A weasel is an enemy of the chicken, often attacking and eating them when it is dark. If it pays a courtesy call to a chicken during New Year, it does this not out of kindness or politeness, but with an ulterior motive\u2014to find an opportunity to catch the chicken and eat it up. So, never trust the apparent friendliness of a weasel. In this idiom, the weasel is a metaphor for someone with an evil intention, and the chicken is a metaphor for someone weak and vulnerable. This idiom is used to describe someone pretending to be kind and friendly, but with an evil intention at heart or having an axe to grind.</p><br/><p>Su Mei disliked Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die to the extreme. If it wasn\u2019t for the big picture, she would\u2019ve taken action long ago .</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, do you mean, miss, I, is a chicken?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026,\u201d Su Mei suddenly remembered that Murong Qi Qi previously told them the meaning of \u2018chicken\u2019. She immediately waved her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I only did a comparison. You are not a chicken. How could you be a chicken\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, don\u2019t talk anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue at one side, laughed with a bent back. Su Mei realized that she said a lot of \u2018chicken\u2019 and quickly stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, it\u2019s absolutely not a good thing that they came. You should stay in the warm house and shouldn\u2019t lower yourself to their level!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I go? Could it be that I\u2019m afraid of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>People coming personally to search for abuse. How would it be alright if she didn\u2019t abuse them a bit? She also didn\u2019t have to worry about much.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yue, bring my cloak. I\u2019ll go meet them!\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time Murong Qi Qi arrived at the entrance of Meixiang yuan1, Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die had almost frozen to death.</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Bao Zhu came to make trouble once; wanting to live at Meixiang yuan, she was driven out by Feng Cang. Feng Cang made a command. Aside from Wanyan Kang, anyone else who wanted to enter Meixiang yuan, must let the guards inform first. This command directly blocked Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die at the entrance.</p><br/><p>Of course, Murong Qi Qi knew about this. So, she dawdled in dressing up for a long time before coming out. Now seeing Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s and Mu Yu Die\u2019s somewhat black lips, her mood lightened up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, letting princess and miss Mu wait for a long time, really sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although her mouth was apologizing, but Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face didn\u2019t have a trace of guilt, making Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die so angry, they gritted their teeth. However, here was Meixiang yuan, is Feng Cang\u2019s territory. The place was surrounded with Feng Cang\u2019s guards, how would they dare to use their hands on Murong Qi Qi?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu put on a smile uglier than crying. In her heart, she was cursing Murong Qi Qi. Bitch, you wait and see! In a while, you\u2019ll see!</p><br/><p>When they were about to enter the carriage, Mu Yu Die saw that behind Murong Qi Qi followed Su Mei, so she immediately said: \u201cPrincess is going out with us. We three will chat and walk through the streets a bit. We\u2019ll be back shortly. She doesn\u2019t have to follow! This carriage is small, I and princess Bao Zhu also didn\u2019t bring maids!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she doesn\u2019t know what kind of trick the other party was playing, but Murong Qi Qi still nodded and let Su Mei go back.</p><br/><p>Inside the carriage, Murong Qi Qi immediately smelled a special fragrance. Ah, soft fragrance powder? Even used such stuff? Really a bit too low!</p><br/><p>Soft fragrance powder is a drug usually in the form of a powder and sometimes in other forms like liquid or pills. This drug is able to make the whole body lose all energy. Even lifting a finger would be impossible.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die were pretending that everything was fine, Murong Qi Qi knew they had definitely taken the antidote. Since you want to play, I\u2019ll play very well with you! Murong Qi Qi sat next to the incense burner. Her small hands touched the incense burner and then she retrieved her hands back.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi touch the incense burner, Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart almost jumped out. Could it be that she\u2019d guessed there\u2019s something wrong with the incense? Only after Murong Qi Qi retrieved her hands back, did Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s hanging heart calm down.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, she is just a rubbish. How would she know what soft fragrance powder is? Besides, this was something Chou er2 had bought from a veteran. How would ordinary people know about it?!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu laughed and felt that she was being oversensitive. Usually, Murong Qi Qi had Feng Cang at her side. Today, she was just a general without an army. She can\u2019t do anything. Why should she (WBZ) be so cautious and afraid of her (MQQ)?</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess seems very happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi spoke leisurely. One hand propped up her chin while her eyes swept over Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s smiling face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being seen through by Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Bao Zhu felt somewhat guilty like a thief. She immediately waved her hand and denied.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust the thought of being able to see the venue a bit later, I feel very happy. In a few days, I\u2019ll be competing there. I feel a bit excited!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that princess is happy to see wangye3!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die joked at one side. Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s face turned red. She looked at Murong Qi Qi and saw that the other party didn\u2019t talk. She then smiled embarrassingly: \u201cYu Die, what are you saying?! A moment later, when we see Cang gege4, the person who should be happy is princess Zhao Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say to take a stroll on the streets in Yongzhou city? Why should we go outside the city to the venue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi wasn\u2019t a fool. These two changed their lines fast. In just a moment, it became outside the city. It appears that outside the city was the critical place. There must be something waiting for her (MQQ) there!</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, I wanted to take a stroll in the city, but suddenly I\u2019m very curious about how the venue looks. You also know that I\u2019m a contestant. By seeing the venue earlier, I can also prepare myself mentally. The chance of winning becomes a lot bigger then! By then, when I win, it\u2019s also helping you and Cang gege, yo! If our Bei Zhou gets first place, then you are Nan Lin wang\u2019s wangfei5, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu had long prepared these lines. Now speaking them out very smoothly, it was also high sounding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! I also want to go see the venue. Although I can\u2019t participate in the tournament, but looking is also good! Princess Zhao Yang, can you fulfill this little request of mine? After all, for me, not being able to participate in the tournament of the four countries is a very regrettable thing\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two collaborating, Murong Qi Qi felt that it\u2019s very interesting. Now, Mu Yu Die had a pained face with a pitiful expression and wanting to move Murong Qi Qi, made her (MQQ) almost laugh out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, no problem! Wangye went out early in the morning. Speaking of it, I also quite miss him. You go look at the venue. I\u2019ll go look for wangye! It so happens that I also want to give wangye a surprise. Don\u2019t know what kind of expression wangye will have when he sees me! Really looking forward to it, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could these two be Murong Qi Qi\u2019s opponents at acting? While talking, Murong Qi Qi intentionally revealed a happy expression, making the two women so angry, they clenched their fists.</p><br/><p>What a hateful woman! Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die exchanged glances. The determination to get rid of Murong Qi Qi was now even more pronounced.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pretended to turn a blind eye towards their glance. Just now, she carefully smelled the soft fragrance powder. According to the formula, it must be from Wu Ji Gong. Just a jealousy between women, didn\u2019t expect that it would also involve Wu Ji Gong. The way Murong Qi Qi looked at Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die became a lot more different.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just, don\u2019t know how they got in contact with Wu Ji Gong. Or, there\u2019s another person\u2026\u2026But no matter what, today these two women began first. Then if she became ruthless later, she can\u2019t be blamed for being merciless!</p><br/><p>The carriage went out of the city gate. Slowly, it drove onto the snow. Murong Qi Qi pushed aside the curtain and looked back once. This was the west gate. The venue was clearly at the east gate. It seemed that she had guessed correctly.</p><br/><p>In her heart, Murong Qi Qi knew very well, but she didn\u2019t make a sound. Her small face was blushing. After each road, she\u2019ll ask the driver when she could see wangye.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like that, Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die revealed a sneer. Let you be proud for a little while longer. When we arrive at that place, then we\u2019ll let you cry out to the heavens, but the heavens don\u2019t respond. Cry out to the earth, but the earth is impervious!</p><br/><p>Cry out to the heavens, but the heavens don\u2019t respond. Cry out to the earth, but the earth is impervious: to be without aid.</p><br/><p>Further and further away, they travelled from the west gate. When they could no longer to see Yongzhou city, the sound of many hooves were suddenly heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Robbery!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the driver saw such a scene, he immediately panicked. He stopped the carriage and knelt in front of the group of people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroes, I, I\u2019m just a driver. I don\u2019t have anything. Please let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost,\u201d a man shouted. The driver ran and rolled in the direction from where he came. He didn\u2019t expect that after he ran for four or five meters, the man would throw a sword at him and directly cut off the driver\u2019s head. The head fell onto the ground and rolled a few times, leaving a trace of warm blood still emitting gas.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people around the man laughed exaggeratedly, as if seeing blood was a thing that made them very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cKilled someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this was her own arrangement, but seeing the head of the driver rolling on the ground was beyond her expectations, making Wanyan Bao Zhu surprised with a trace of being scared. Why wasn\u2019t it the same like what Chou er said? Obviously, they were only planning on going against Murong Qi Qi. Why did they kill her driver?</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Wanyan Bao Zhu to understand the matter, the curtain was opened by a sword. A face with a scar made by a sword appeared in front of the three people.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, it\u2019s three chickens!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar wiped away the snow on the bottom of his mustache and grinned, revealing a white tooth.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, today we\u2019ve a good harvest. We\u2019ll get to eat meat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Oh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the men outside the carriage heard that there\u2019s women, they all shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die saw the hungry look of those men, she was dumbfounded and immediately looked at Wanyan Bao Zhu. Why was this not the same as what they had talked about before? Didn\u2019t they contact the killers of Wu Ji Gong? How come it became a group of bandits?</p><br/><p>\u201cGet off the carriage! Get off the carriage! Don\u2019t dillydally!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar cut the carriage with the sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill not getting off the carriage? Could it be that you want me to go invite you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you guys get down first\u2026\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s voice began to tremble. Seeing her appearance like that, Murong Qi Qi chuckled loudly. She straightened her clothes and carefully went off the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, it\u2019s really a chick! It\u2019s a good chick!\u201d</p><br/><p>A short man saw Murong Qi Qi, he immediately shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, the way that chick gets down the carriage looks very nice! Could she be a lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at your unpromising appearance!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar spat on the ground and glanced once at the small and exquisite Murong Qi Qi. Then he looked at Mu Yu Die.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up, hurry up. Why do you dawdle so much? Could it be that you are waiting for someone to come save you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die get down the carriage very reluctantly. Her palms were full of sweat. She was very afraid. She really didn\u2019t know why Murong Qi Qi could be so calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, this chick is also alright. Only, she is a bit old and too cocky. I still like that miss of just now better!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who talked, was still that short man of just now. An \u2018old\u2019 made Mu Yu Die\u2019s expression sank. Does she really look very old? Otherwise, why would that shorty say that? She obviously looks more beautiful than Murong Qi Qi, why do these men like Murong Qi Qi more?</p><br/><p>But this way also let Mu Yu Die feel relieved. The bandits taking a fancy to Murong Qi Qi, it\u2019ll be best if they kidnapped her and made her the wife of bandits, so no one would fight with her over Feng Cang anymore!</p><br/><p>While Mu Yu Die was secretly being happy about the bandits taking a fancy to Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Bao Zhu dawdled in the carriage for a long time before coming down. Finally, when the man with the scar wasn\u2019t paying attention, Wanyan Bao Zhu cut down the rope binding the horse with a knife. She turned and got on the horse. Her legs clipped on the horse\u2019s belly. While slapping the horse butt, with a \u2018jia\u2019 sound, the horse rushed out like wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, want to run?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar laughed. His eyes showed disdain for Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s little trick. Then, he took out a long rope, and riding a horse, chased after her.</p><br/><p>This man was an excellent equestrian. Didn\u2019t take long before he caught up with Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cRise!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man swung the rope in his hands. The rope formed a big circle and wrapped around Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar suddenly pulled, dragging Wanyan Bao Zhu down. She fell onto the snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous! Let me go! I\u2019m princess Bao Zhu! Don\u2019t you want to live anymore?! Let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>From birth till now, this was the first time Wanyan Bao Zhu was in such a sorry state. She\u2019s actually being dragged in the snow. She is the noble princess. When has she received such treatment?!</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard! Let me go! I\u2019m a princess! You this bastard! Bengong6 will execute your nine generations! Bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s voice was very loud. Although they were separated by some distance, but the wind still brought her voice over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, that chick is very shrew. Really suits you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorty shouted at this side. Murong Qi Qi chuckled softly. She felt that this scene was very funny. Didn\u2019t Wanyan Bao Zhu wanted to play a trick on her, why did it become like this?</p><br/><p>The man with the scar didn\u2019t care if Wanyan Bao Zhu was a princess or something else. He tied the rope and pulled her up from the snow without any tender or protective feelings for the fairer sex.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, is everything alright?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the man with the scar was in front of them, Mu Yu Die rushed to Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s side and helped her remove the rope.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGegege!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the way, Wanyan Bao Zhu had been facing the ground and ate a lot of dirty snow. The skin on her face was also broken because of the rubbing. At this time, the usual face had disappeared. Where was there a trace of the number one beauty of Bei Zhou? She was like a just-pulled-out bright red radish!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, this chick is too ugly! Really an ugly thing,\u201d the shorty once again shouted. I don\u2019t like such an ugly shrew. It\u2019s better to sell her to a low-grade brothel! Brothers, what do you think?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bandits shouted and raised their swords.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want the ugly and old women! We only want the young miss to be our bandit\u2019s wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, bastards! Bengong is a princess! You, this group of bastards! Bengong wants to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu wanted to urge her inner energy to kill these people. She was a fourth level martial artist. Soon, she would enter level five. As long as she could push out her inner energy, she could easily kill these bastards! Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s idea was good, but when she urged her inner energy, she found out that her whole body was soft. She didn\u2019t have the slightest strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, it\u2019s useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die shook her head while smiling bitterly. Just now, when she went down the carriage, she wanted to use the same way to protect herself, she didn\u2019t expect that she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was startled. Didn\u2019t they take the antidote? Could it be that Chou er lied to her? Who is that woman? Damn it! She actually has been fooled! Why is it like this?!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s face was like a plate full of pigments. Very colorful. There were more dark colors. From Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s face, Mu Yu Die already guessed the reason. Her expression immediately changed. The men obviously looked like people not to be trifled with. Now, they didn\u2019t even have the strength to truss a chicken, how would they escape?</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, why is it not the same as what you had told me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die tried her best to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong also don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu gritted her teeth and glared once fiercely at Murong Qi Qi. It\u2019s all because of that woman. That woman made her be impatient and be fooled! Everything was because of her!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroes, we are just weak women and don\u2019t have any ties or hate with you. Asking you to please let us go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die raised her head and looked at the man with the scar. This man was the leader of these bandits. As long as she could move him, they would be saved.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you came because of money, we\u2019ve some. Besides in Yongzhou, we also have money. I can go back to take money for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Mu Yu Die mention money, the man with the scar pondered for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys go back to take some money? If you come back with officers and not money, then what? No, no, this won\u2019t do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can leave a hostage here, ah! With a hostage, you won\u2019t be afraid that we\u2019ll go back on our words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die immediately seized the opportunity and strongly tempted the man with the scar.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is princess Zhao Yang, the one who Xi Qi has sent for a marriage alliance and is Nan Lin wang\u2019s wangfei. Nan Lin wang favors her the most. As long as you keep her, Nan Lin wang will certainly come with a lot of money to redeem her! It\u2019s the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die pushed Murong Qi Qi till she was in front of the man with the scar.</p><br/><p>\u201cNan Lin wang is in Yongzhou. Feng Cang will certainly give you money!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar seemed very interested in what Mu Yu Die had said. He looked at Murong Qi Qi from head to toe for a long time. In the end, he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe does have some air of princess. She\u2019s much stronger than that ugly woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the man with the scar talking like this about her, Wanyan Bao Zhu wished she could go forward and give him a slap in the face, but she was grabbed tightly by Mu Yu Die.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, if you don\u2019t endure the small things, you will spoil the big thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although, she had been pulled into a pit today by Wanyan Bao Zhu, but her emperor father was her grandfather\u2019s biggest head. Between Murong Qi Qi and Wanyan Bao Zhu, Mu Yu Die of course will save Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>Only after hearing Mu Yu Die say that, did Wanyan Bao Zhu stop. She didn\u2019t say anything. She only swept her eyes once again at Murong Qi Qi. Her gaze was like daggers.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys won\u2019t lie, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar touched his moustache and circled once around Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe being a hostage really is not bad. It\u2019s just, why should I believe you? The saying is that a woman\u2019s heart is like a needle in the sea. In case Feng Cang came with soldiers to encircle us, what then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the man with the scar still didn\u2019t want to let her go, Mu Yu Die gritted her teeth. She took out her personal jade pendant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my jade pendant. I\u2019m the eldest miss of the xiangfu7. If I breach my words, you can take my jade pendant to slander my reputation!\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to survive, Mu Yu Die could only take this step. In this era, a jade pendant was a personal item and couldn\u2019t be shown to people easily. If given to a man, it meant that they had set their love. Now, Mu Yu even took out her jade pendant, it appears that she really was eager to leave here.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Yu Die? Good name!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar hooked Mu Yu Die\u2019s pendant and brought it in front of him. He looked at the words on the pendant and read them out. He put it on his nose and sniffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, smells good, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Boss, what kind of smell does it has? Let me also smell it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorty shouted again, while the others were booing.</p><br/><p>The scarred man\u2019s frivolous appearance made Mu Yu Die blush. That had been something she wore closely. Now, it\u2019s being treated so disrespectfully, Mu Yu Die really wanted to kill him!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is yours?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar put away the jade pendant and looked at Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the person or leave the keepsake!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although unwilling, but since there was no other way, Wanyan Bao Zhu could only take out her princess\u2019s jade seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bengong\u2019s seal. It can be used as a certificate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWanyan Bao Zhu\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the scar looked for a long time at the phoenix carved jade.</p><br/><p>\u201cZeze, didn\u2019t expect that you really are a princess! Alright, this thing is not bad!

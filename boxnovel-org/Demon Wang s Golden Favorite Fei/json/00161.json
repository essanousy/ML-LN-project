That gu music was similar to the music of ancient times. Long and slow like melodious love words\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo\u2026,\u201d A moment later, everyone heard a strange voice.</p><br/><p>The chest of Wanyan Lie, who wasn\u2019t able to move, got nauseous. A hairy and hot-tempered thing appeared in his abdomen. A kind of terror climbed up along his stomach and came to his throat.</p><br/><p>As it got closer to his oral cavity, Wanyan Lie could clearly feel those legs of the mother gu. They touched his throat like a brush. They swept gently over his throat as if he had inhaled a dandelion. It was disgustingly itchy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOu\u2026,\u201d Although he couldn\u2019t move, but Wanyan Lie still found it difficult to suppress that kind of nausea. He gagged again and again, wanting to spit out that mother gu.</p><br/><p>However, this mother gu seemed to understand human nature very well. It seemed to know Wanyan Lie\u2019s purpose. It simply stopped at the top of Wanyan Lie\u2019s throat. Its forepaw tightly grasped Wanyan Lie\u2019s tonsils. It also proudly made \u2018googoo\u2019 sounds as if it seemed to say, \u201cI just won\u2019t come out. See what you can do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie heard the sound coming from his mouth. He was very frightened. Once upon a time, he was also a spectator. He\u2019d watched at a side how the mother gu tortured others who was so much in pain that they didn\u2019t want to live anymore. He didn\u2019t expect that retribution came so fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up, get it out! Get it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie almost roared these words out to Ming Yue Cheng. Presumably, those women who died at Long Autumn palace was also scared like this in the past! Wanyan Lie finally realized what kind of terrorizing feeling this was.</p><br/><p>He also didn\u2019t remember if it was the third or the fourth woman who lived here and said to him when she was about to die, \u201cWanyan Lie, one day, retribution certainly will come at you!\u201d At that time, Wanyan Lie dismissed these words. It was just, now, he finally believed in karma and finally believed in retribution.</p><br/><p>However, he was unwilling to accept! He still hasn\u2019t seen Wanyan Ming Yue. How could he give up?! He persisted for sixteen years. These past sixteen years, it was him who accompanied Wanyan Ming Yue. Why did Wanyan Ming Yue leave like it was nothing? He didn\u2019t believe that she would be so heartless! He couldn\u2019t die like this. He wanted to live on and wait for Wanyan Ming Yue to give him an answer!</p><br/><p>\u201cOu\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie continued to vomit. Ming Yue Cheng simply stopped blowing the whistle. He crossed his arms and looked at Wanyan Lie. Did this man not know that the more he was like this now, the more the gu won\u2019t come out? If Wanyan Lie relaxed, that mother gu would come out after hearing the song. Now, he retched like this and almost put his fingers in his throat to grab the gu out. Mother gu knew human nature so well, how would it come out?!</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo!\u201d The mother gu seemed to have made up its mind to play Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>It released its paws and left the tonsils. It wriggled its fat body and moved a few steps forward and came to Wanyan Lie\u2019s tongue. \u201cGoogoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie thought that the mother gu wanted to come out. He was very happy and continued to retch. He didn\u2019t expect that the mother gu\u2019s paws clutched his tongue and the two sharp teeth at the front bit Wanyan Lie\u2019s tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d An unclear scream came from Wanyan Lies\u2019 throat. He was so much in pain that he sweated. His mouth was full of blood.</p><br/><p>Getting a taste of fresh blood, the mother gu was very happy. It opened it mouths widely, sucked blood from Wanyan Lie\u2019s tongue and made \u201cgoodoo, goodoo\u2019 sounds. It was like the sound of a child drinking water.</p><br/><p>Seeing how scary of a thing the mother gu was, Wanyan Kang felt scared from the bottom of his heart. Looking at his emperor father bearing such a torture, Wanyan Kang felt his heart soften a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet him go, alright\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Kang\u2019s voice was very low. He didn\u2019t want Wanyan Lie to be too miserable. So, he begged Ming Yue Cheng. Although, Wanyan Lie really did wrong, but looking with his own eyes how sorry the figure of his own father was, Wanyan Kang couldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>Originally, Ming Yue Cheng also didn\u2019t intend on torturing Wanyan Lie. It was just, he (WL) wanted to use the way of vomit to extract the mother gu. This infuriated the mother gu. That was why the mother gu tortured Wanyan Lie like this.</p><br/><p>With the bamboo whistle on his mouth, Ming Yue Cheng once again made a touching melody. When the mother gu heard this melody, it raised its head and looked outside. It had some hesitation.</p><br/><p>Delicious blood was flowing out from the tongue in the mouth, but the wound of the whistle was a command it couldn\u2019t defy. How should it choose? The mother gu was also struggling!</p><br/><p>If it was just now, the mother gu would\u2019ve certainly climb out of Wanyan Lie\u2019s mouth, but now, that delicious blood was at the corner of its mouth and exuded a sweet taste. The blood let the mother gu be reluctant to part with it.</p><br/><p>Seeing the mother gu like this, Ming Yue Cheng smiled and continued to blow on the whistle. He knew that the mother gu was reluctant to part with fresh human blood. This was his most favorite food. So now, he need to be patient to tempt it out.</p><br/><p>Jin Mo and Su Yue had already put a piece of bamboo as wide a finger in front of Wanyan Lie. In the middle was a groove. At the other end was a small jade pot. Su Mei lit a fire and put the jade pot on the fire. The fire slowly warmed the pot.</p><br/><p>A moment later, a peculiar fragrant emitted from the jade pot and spread throughout the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo!\u201d The mother gu keenly smelled the fragrance. It twisted its chubby body, came to the corner of Wanyan Lie\u2019s mouth and looked around.</p><br/><p>Su Mei held a small fan. She fanned the fragrance in the direction of the mother gu. a strong fragrance floated. The mother gu immediately got excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo! Googoo!\u201d After discovering a smell better than human blood, the mother gu almost \u2018jumped\u2019 out of Wanyan Lie\u2019s mouth. Along on the \u2018bridge\u2019 Su Yue and Jin Mo built for it, it went straight to the jade pot.</p><br/><p>When it arrived at the opening of the jade pot, the mother gu specifically leaned forward and looked inside. Not waiting for it to see clearly what was inside, the bamboo whistle in Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s hand lifted it inside the pot. Su Mei immediately covered the jade pot and closed the mother gu inside the pot.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s words made these people felt relieved.</p><br/><p>The look of that mother gu still played in everyone\u2019s head\u2026chubby body and red like blood eyes. It was creepy to look at. Fortunately, there was Ming Yue Cheng to catch the mother gu. This was a good thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the fire stop. Continue to boil! Maintain a small fire. Don\u2019t let the temperature raise too fast! Now, I need to go call the child gu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just now, he only called the mother gu out of Wanyan lie\u2019s body. Now, getting the child gu out was the focus of the key. Everyone was with rapt attention and didn\u2019t dare to breath. Even Wanyan Lie who was constantly screaming from pain had been hit on the acupuncture point of muteness, making him unable to make a sound.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng blew on the whistle. When he played the melody, the people could clearly hear that this song was different. It was somewhat happy and somewhat ignorant. The child gu was similar to a human child. Naturally, you should use some happy music to awaken it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoogoo!\u201d The mother gu in the jade pot didn\u2019t seem to be aware of the imminent danger. It coordinated with Ming Yue Cheng and made \u2018googoo\u2019 sounds as if it was calling its child to tell it that here, there\u2019s a delicious dinner and to come quickly taste it together.</p><br/><p>Different from the \u2018googoo\u2019 sound of the mother gu, the child gu made \u2018guagua\u2019 sounds. Its voice wasn\u2019t as high as the mother gu\u2019s, but you can hear it clearly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Guagua\u2026guagua\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the child gu! Everyone exchanged a glance. As long as they call the child gu out, put it in the jade pot together with the mother gu and boil it together with Chinese medicine and tea, this problem would be solved.</p><br/><p>It was just, after listening for a while, Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s face darkened. He blew on the whistle and looked for where the \u2018guagua\u2019 sound came from. In the end, he stood in front of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Qi Qi also heard the sound coming from her belly. Sweat was on her palms. Her face also paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? How come it\u2019s like this?!\u201d Feng Cang who stood at a side already saw the seriousness of the matter from Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng put down the bamboo whistle and looked ta Murong Qi Qi\u2019s belly. He grabbed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand and checked her pulse. In the end, it let Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s expression become darker.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Feng Cang had a bad feeling. However, he couldn\u2019t say more when Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s fist landed on Feng Cang\u2019s handsome face, \u201cBastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s roar and that heavy blow made the people dumbfounded. They saw that purple figure rushed over and pinned Feng Cang to the ground. He directly pressured him across the ground. \u201cYou, this bastard!\u201d Ming Yue Cheng sent another fist over, but this time, Feng Cang grabbed his fist.</p><br/><p>Before, Feng Cang didn\u2019t had any guard against him, so he suffered that punch. Now, his left face was already swollen. His lips had been broken by his teeth. Feng Cang didn\u2019t know why Ming Yue Cheng was being like this. However, he got one punch. This time he wouldn\u2019t let him (MYC) hit him again.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s counterattack made Ming Yue Cheng angrier. He screamed bastard repeatedly and became a ball with Feng Cang on the ground.</p><br/><p>This scene made the people dumbfounded. What\u2019s happening here? Why didn\u2019t Ming Yue Cheng say anything and directly fisted Feng Cang? What was the problem?</p><br/><p>\u201cSeparate them!\u201d Seeing the two grown men tumbling on the ground like children, Murong Qi Qi was the most sensible among the crowd. The moment she said that, Wanyan Kang and Jin Mo, both pulled one and spent a long time before they could separate Feng Cang and Ming Yue Cheng.</p><br/><p>Now, gone was the handsome appearance of the two. Their whole body was covered in dust. Feng Cang\u2019s left face was wounded. Ming Yue Cheng wasn\u2019t much better. His right eye was very swollen. The originally clear eye was now narrowed into a seam.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Although being pulled away, Ming Yue Cheng was still cursing at Feng Cang. His eyes showed anger, making the confusion enlarge in the other people\u2019s hearts. What was the case for Ming Yue Cheng to become so out of control?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that there is a problem with the child gu?\u201d Recalling that before Ming Yue Cheng attacked Feng Cang, he had checked Murong Qi Qi\u2019s pulse, Jin Mo frowned. Could it be that there was a problem? Jin Mo\u2019s hand landed on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wrist. A moment later, Jin Mo\u2019s face also changed greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?! Quickly tell us, ah! Really making people so anxious!\u201d Su Mei saw that Jin Mo and Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s expression turned bad, she was very anxious and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess is pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Mo said the answer. The people who were nervous just now, because of this news, their face became a lot better.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! Miss is pregnant!\u201d Su Mei screamed, but the moment she screamed this, she felt something was wrong. If this was a good thing, why would Ming Yue Cheng and Jin Mo\u2019s expression be abnormal? Su Mei thought of it; after the happiness, the others also discovered the problem. They all looked at Ming Yue Cheng and wanted to find an answer from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess is indeed pregnant, but the child gu is in the fetus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s words were like a bolt from the blue making everyone surprised. No one dared to believe this fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a child?\u201d Murong Qi Qi touched her belly. She was careless. She actually didn\u2019t know that she had a child and was about to become a mother! However, why would this gu be on the child?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s question got the answer from Ming Yue Cheng, \u201cThe child gu is different from the mother gu. It hasn\u2019t taken form yet. It\u2019s only as big as an ant. Usually, when someone got a gu he/she doesn\u2019t need to abstain from intercourse. However, among the mother child gu, because the child gu is still a larva, the one who has the child gu must abstain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu are extremely intelligent creatures. They can choose their host according to the environment. The stability of an adult gu is strong. Unless, it was controlled by the bamboo whistle, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t leave its original host. However, the child gu is a larva and didn\u2019t undergo domestication. Their self-control isn\u2019t strong. They will choose a better host such as babies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking till here, Ming Yue Cheng glared fiercely at Feng Cang. He wished to stab him two times with a dagger.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because Feng Cang got Murong Qi Qi pregnant. That was why, when the two had intercourse, the child gu chose the child in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s belly as host. In this world, there was no place better to take advantage of than a fetus!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Feng Cang froze there. He also finally understood why Ming Yue Cheng was so agitated.</p><br/><p>He had a child. This was originally a delightful matter, but now Ming Yue Cheng told him, the child gu went to his child\u2019s body and lived in the body of the child. It was in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s belly. How could Feng Cang accept such an outcome?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve have a way, right?\u201d Feng Cang stepped forward, grabbed Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s hand and asked anxiously, \u201cYou certainly will get rid of the child gu, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m powerless.\u201d Ming Yue Cheng smiled bitterly and shook his head. If he had a way, he wouldn\u2019t watch the woman he loves go through such a thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world there\u2019s no place more suitable for gu to grow than a woman\u2019s warm womb. Even if the temptation of the outside world is very big, the child gu wouldn\u2019t be moved. I can\u2019t let this child gu come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s words made Feng Cang went completely blank.</p><br/><p>How\u2026come it was like this?</p><br/><p>In contrast, the involved party, Murong Qi Qi was the most sensible.</p><br/><p>She got a child. So great! This is her and Feng Cang\u2019s child, ah! When the others were concerned for her, in her heart, she felt happiness and bliss. When she thought about a little life who was like her and like Feng Cang sprouted in her belly, Murong Qi Qi would feel very happy! \u201cIs there no other way to deal with this child gu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is only two ways. Firstly, abort the child. You\u2019re now only one month pregnant. Abort it is the best way. Secondly, give birth to the child and find people of the Qiang tribe to get rid of the gu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng explained these two methods very clearly. Murong Qi Qi would absolutely not agree on aborting this child and deprive the child of life. This is the fruit of her and Feng Cang\u2019s love. She would not easily give up on it. The second option is feasible.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbort\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give birth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Two different decisions came respectively from Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing!\u201d Seeing that Murong Qi Qi insisted on keeping the child, Feng Cang came to her side and held her hand. His eyes showed regret and hate towards himself, \u201cQing Qing, I know you like children very much, but we can\u2019t have this child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, Feng Cang felt that it was right that Ming Yue Cheng had hit him. He really was a bastard. He\u2019d actually implicated Murong Qi Qi and their child!</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi expected Feng Cang to oppose. He was worried about her and also worried about the child. Murong Qi Qi could understand this. Feng Cang\u2019s guilt made Murong Qi Qi feel heartache. This was not his fault! Even she, the doctor, didn\u2019t know the characteristics of the child gu. If you\u2019re not someone from Qiang tribe, you wouldn\u2019t fully understand the characteristics of gu. What did this have to do with Feng Cang?!</p><br/><p>However, Feng Cang didn\u2019t understand a woman\u2019s heart of being a mother. This little life was like a little seed that sprouted and grew in her body. The child had just arrived, how could they let him/her leave?! She was unwilling!</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue, if I give birth to the child, is it really possible to get rid of the child gu on him/her?\u201d Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t answer Feng Cang. Instead, she asked Ming Yue Cheng.</p><br/><p>She wanted this child, but if getting rid of the gu would harm the child\u2019s life or let the child be so much in pain that he/she wants to die, she wouldn\u2019t be so selfish to force this child to stay and let him/her bear that pain from the moment he/she was born.</p><br/><p>\u201cChildren born with gu are called gu people. Because the gu grew up with the child since he/she was a fetus, so getting rid of the gu on the child\u2019s body will be more difficult than getting rid of gu in the usual way. The time it would take will also be longer. Perhaps, one or two years. Perhaps five or six years\u2026But don\u2019t worry, the gu won\u2019t hurt someone who lived with it since he/she was a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng\u2019s words made Murong Qi Qi more determined to keep this child. The silent Jin Mo, who\u2019d been waiting at a side, now interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs far as I know, people from Qiang tribe would not get rid of gu for outsiders. Although your majesty has Qiang tribe\u2019s blood, but I am afraid that the clan\u2019s chief won\u2019t be so easy to talk with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will think of a way\u2026,\u201d Ming Yue Cheng interrupted Jin Mo. How could he not be clear about these things? However, since Murong Qi Qi wanted it, he will do his utmost to help.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, the most crucial thing now is that it won\u2019t be easy to nourish this child in the mother\u2019s body. Maybe you will have to bear more hardship than other pregnant woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Ming Yue Cheng wanted to say \u2018pain\u2019, but when the word came to his lips, he changed it to hardship. He was afraid that he would frighten Murong Qi Qi. He didn\u2019t want her to spend her whole pregnancy frightened. So, he only used \u2018hardship\u2019 to describe what would happen in the following months.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

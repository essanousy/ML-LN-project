Although my eyes are small, but my vision is very good. Second, our Jue Se Feng sells clothes in order of the first one who came is the first one served. No matter who you are, what your identity is and how noble you are, when you come to our Jue Se Fang you all are our guests. We will treat everyone equally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong\u2019s decent appearance and humorous discourse, let Feng Cang appreciate him very much. This appreciation even reached to Guang Hua gongzi 1 who is behind this Jue Se Fang. Being able to teach his subordinate like this, this Guang Hua gongzi is no ordinary person.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian saw that Longze Yu Er suffered defeat, immediately came forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dress has been fancied by princess. You just need to sell. Is it not money, how much do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTen thousand golden teals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong shouted the price. It directly let Murong Xin Lian\u2019s eyelid jump.</p><br/><p>\u201cTen thousand? Golden teals! You want to slaughter people, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong squinted his eyes and pretended to not know Murong Xin Lian\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian stroked her clothes and raised her sharp chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jing wangfei2!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong stretched his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeemingly Xi Qi country\u2019s Jing wang3 only has a ce fei4\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing that Murong Xin Lian is now most tangled about is her own status. Why is it not wangfei? Why is there a \u2018ce\u2019 in front? Because of this she is actually being laughed at by a small shopkeeper. Her expression immediately turned bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will soon become wangfei!\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hand unconsciously touched her belly. This movement has been taken into Feng Cang\u2019s eyes. So it\u2019s like that. No wonder she is so arrogant. It\u2019s because she already has something to rely on, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cShopkeeper, here\u2019s is ten thousand golden teals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ru Yi put a box in front of Fang Tong. He opened. Golden colors everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur family\u2019s young master has taken a fancy on this \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019. We paid the full amount. On the ninth we will come collect it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ru Yi polite manner and Longze Yu Er\u2019s arrogance became a stark contrast. And his way was lavish making people unable to breath, making the other guests murmur at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince young master paid the full amount, this shop will make an exception and let young master take the dress first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong let people wrap the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 and smilingly handed the dress over to Ru Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master must\u2019ve brought this dress for your wife! Your wife is really lucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong using wife for Murong Qi Qi, making Feng Cang\u2019s mood very good. That\u2019s right ah, not much longer, she will become his bride, become his wangfei. Furen?5 Wife? Beloved consort? Qing Qing? Qi er6\u2026\u2026Using these nicknames for her is really not bad.</p><br/><p>Qing Qing: term of endearments between spouses.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Feng Cang and Ru Yi walked to the door with the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 that she fancied, Longze Yu Er didn\u2019t make trouble for Fang Tong anymore. Instead she let people block Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can leave, but you need to leave the dress here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er stared at the \u2018Gold thread dress \u2018in Ru Yi\u2019s hand. The golden sunlight shone on the gauze made it have a mysterious light. Longze Yu Er absolutely loves this dress. She definitely won\u2019t allow such a beautiful dress being dressed on someone else!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan it be that princess wants to be a robber in broad daylight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s voice has a thin layer of coldness. Ru Yi knows his master\u2019s mind. He immediately fired a firework in the sky. Red firework exploded in the air, really beautiful.</p><br/><p>Knowing that the other party is sending a sign for help, but Longze Yu Er isn\u2019t afraid. Here is Xi Liang, Xi Qi\u2019s capital. She is Xi Qi\u2019s princess Ping Yang. Unless imperial father and mother is here, otherwise no one can stop her!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dress is something bengong7 took a fancy on!\u201d</p><br/><p>The men under Longze Yu Er already sent a messenger to the imperial guard of the capital. Seeing that man run faster than a monkey, Feng Cang revealed a bloodthirsty smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! It\u2019s obviously my young master who ordered it first and also paid ten thousand golden teals!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the imperial guards of the capital have arrived, Ruyi stood in front of Feng Cang to protect him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect that a princess of a country will be so rude and unreasonable! Can\u2019t afford it, now turned into robbing. What kind of reason is this?! Do you still care about the law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLaw?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this word, Longze Yu Er seemed like she heard the funniest thing in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaws are being made by my family. Here, bengong is the law!\u201d</p><br/><p>The head of the imperial guards of the capital Hu Bu Xiu rushed over. The moment he saw Longze Yu Er, he got headache. This princess doesn\u2019t have other skill than to order them to here and to there.</p><br/><p>A while ago when she wanted to seal Tong Bao Zhai, in the end, the result is that all the ladies of the whole capital have a grudge on him. Without Tong Bao Zhai, the jewelries they love so much are gone. They can\u2019t do anything to princess, they can only use a black hand on him, this small head of the imperial guards. Even his own wife has punished him by not letting him sleep on the bed.</p><br/><p>Just a few days without trouble, princess Ping Yang once again made trouble. He really doesn\u2019t know when there will be an end\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate greets princess Ping Yang\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although unwilling, Hu Bu Xiu still went forward and bowed. Who let the other party\u2019s identity be so noble and her father is the biggest boss in this country!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, go rob that dress for bengong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er pointed at Feng Cang. Murong Xin Lian at a side pulled Longze Yu Er\u2019s sleeves. Only then did she change her words: \u201cNo, it\u2019s get the dress for bengong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, this dress is another\u2019s. How can you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2019. Longze Yu Er was full of anger and didn\u2019t have a place to vent on. She heard Hu Bu Xiu\u2019s words and immediately slapped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did it become that when bengong does something, you, a slave, has the right to meddle in?! If you can\u2019t take the burdens off bengong, then for what do I need you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er kicked Hu Bu Xiu away. She ordered to the guards at the back: \u201cYou all listen, who robs the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 for bengong, bengong will let him become the head of the imperial guards of the capital!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words fell into those guards\u2019 ears, all of them exploded.</p><br/><p>The head of the imperial guards, everyone wants to sit on that position! Anyway, if something happens, there\u2019s princess Ping Yang who will block for them. Also the other party just have one master and one servant. Their mind turned and immediately surrendered to Longze Yu Er.</p><br/><p>Just a moment, forty imperial guards have surrounded Feng Cang and Ru Yi. Their weapons pointed at this pair of master and servant. They have the posture as if they will use force.</p><br/><p>\u201cAudacious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ru Yi didn\u2019t expect that this group of people will actually listen to a woman and will use force to his wangye. If this is Bei Zhou, even if he gives them ten galls they won\u2019t dare.</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi\u2026.,\u201d not only Longze Yu Er, Murong Xin Lian also laughed. Just a servant, when talking he does looks like it. Saying such words when facing Xi Qi\u2019s princess, his mind must\u2019ve gotten into water.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hand over princess\u2019s dress!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone\u2019s hand is on the swords. His posture is like if Feng Cang doesn\u2019t hand over the dress, he\u2019ll do something to him.</p><br/><p>Seeing the other party like this, Feng Cang humphed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if benwang8 says no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Did you hear, he actually said benwang! Benwang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er laughed out loud. The hairpins and beads on her head also shook.</p><br/><p>\u201cAudacious commoner, you actually dare to impersonate a wangye. Really a sin to die one million times! Chop him for bengong!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Young master/ also used to refer a famous unmarried man</p><br/><p>2. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye</p><br/><p>3.

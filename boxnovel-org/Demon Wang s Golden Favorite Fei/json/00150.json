In this lively and noisy banquet, like a clear spring it flowed into Murong Qing Lian\u2019s heart. She slowly raised her head. Her eyes looked through the hair in front of her forehead at this beautiful boy. She didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Although, the fear in Murong Qing Lian\u2019s eyes lessened a lot, but her whole body was still full of guarding. From those old and new scares on her body, Misha knew that she suffered a non-human torture. Making Murong Qing Lian believe in them so quickly was something unlikely. So, Misha tried to convince himself to be patient and to take it slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian, I came to meet you! Don\u2019t be afraid. I won\u2019t hurt you! I also won\u2019t let anyone hurt you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The gentleness in Misha\u2019s words let Jia Lan be very surprised. At least, knowing Misha for so many years, he had never seen Misha be so gentle towards any woman. Could it be that Murong Qing Lian really was the person he was looking for?</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian still didn\u2019t move. Her body also no longer backed. Don\u2019t know why, the beautiful boy in front of her made her be not so afraid and his voice was like it had magic, making her guard collapse bit by bit. Slowly, Murong Qing Lian raised her right hand that was covered with whip marks.</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian taking the initiative made Misha very happy. She believed him! She chose to believe his words! It seemed that nothing was worthier to let people feel happy than this!</p><br/><p>Misha went forward and held Murong Qing Lian\u2019s injured right hand. His heart ached very much, \u201cLian, does your hand hurt? Big brother would apply cream for you, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Murong Qing Lian nodded obediently. Her well-behaved appearance made people feel pity. Regardless of the stench coming from Murong Qing Lian\u2019s whole body, Misha reached out, picked her up and carried her in his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d The people who were originally watching a play, saw that this beautiful young boy didn\u2019t care about being dirty and actually carried that ugly and also smelly person, they were very surprised. Someone even screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Misha turned his wheelchair and looked at the person who screamed. Different from his former amiable self, at this time his eyes exuded a chilling murderous aura, making people when met with that pair of cold eyes couldn\u2019t help but shiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cMisha, here is Bei Zhou!\u201d Jia Lan who was familiar with Misha\u2019s personality, opened his mouth to stop him. His implied meaning was, here is Bei Zhou and that they couldn\u2019t kill people according to their temper.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph\u2026,\u201d Misha humphed slightly and retrieved his gaze. He looked gently at the petite woman in his hand. He seemed as if he wasn\u2019t affected by her dirtiness and smelliness, \u201cLian, I\u2019ll take you home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHome\u2026,\u201d Murong Qing Lian looked blankly at Misha as if she didn\u2019t understand what home was.</p><br/><p>Seeing that pair of confused eyes of Murong Qing Lian, Misha clenched his fist. Lian, who harmed you like this? Regardless of who it was, as long as I find him/her, I will definitely take revenge for you!</p><br/><p>When Misha stabilized his mood, Jia Lan looked around. He discovered that there was no trace of Xia Yun Xi. So, he asked Wanyan Lie, \u201cYour majesty, didn\u2019t Dong Lu\u2019s princess Yun come today? She\u2019s my junior sister. This time when we came, Dong Lu\u2019s emperor asked us to pass a letter to her!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Jia Lan mentioned Xia Yun Xi did everyone discover that they didn\u2019t know where this princess went to. Some sharp-eyed people discovered that Wanyan Yi also disappeared. Where did these two people go to? Everyone was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, this subject wife also don\u2019t know where Yi er1 went to\u2026,\u201d Just now, Lin Ke Xin was focused on staring at the pearls. She simply didn\u2019t pay attention to her son. She looked once again. Murong Qi Qi was still here. Lin Ke Xin\u2019s eyelids began to jump badly.</p><br/><p>According to their plan, now, shouldn\u2019t Murong Qi Qi and Wanyan Yi be having intercourse with each other? Why was Murong Qi Qi like nothing happened to her and Wanyan Yi disappeared? When she saw Xia Yun Xi\u2019s empty seat, Lin Ke Xin got a bad feeling. Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Lin Ke Xin suddenly stood up. She completely forgot that Wanyan Lie who sat next to her, hadn\u2019t spoken yet. Now, she was only thinking about Wanyan Yi\u2019s matter. Xia Yun Xi wasn\u2019t here. Wanyan Yi disappeared. Is not that these two people had something, right?!</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort De, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Directly hearing the \u2018no\u2019 from Lin Ke Xin, Wanyan Lie frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoth, nothing.\u201d Lin Ke Xin didn\u2019t dare to let Wanyan Lie know that they partnered to calculate Murong Qi Qi and want her to lose her chastity. According to the degree of Wanyan Lie\u2019s care for Murong Qi Qi; if he knew their conspiracy, Wanyan Yi\u2019s future would be ruined.</p><br/><p>However, if Wanyan Yi was really with Xia Yun Xi, then how should she end this matter? Could it be to let Wanyan Yi marry Xia Yun Xi? This could be done. Xia Yun Xi is Dong Lu\u2019s princess. She could be some help to Wanyan Yi, but no matter how, she couldn\u2019t be compared with Murong Qi Qi, ah!</p><br/><p>Although Lin Ke Xin didn\u2019t say anything, but Wanyan Lie wasn\u2019t a fool. This woman\u2019s face already betrayed her heart. Then, recalling that just now, Wanyan Yi and Xia Yun Xi toasted at the same time with Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Lie\u2019s face turned dark.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s the emperor. He didn\u2019t bother with the matter of the harem, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t know those tactics of the harem. Now, those tactics had been used on Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, how could Wanyan Lie not be furious?! Even though, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi were fine, but they were calculated by people. This let Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince nothing is the matter, beloved officials, accompany zhen2 for a walk! This hall is a bit stuffy. Let\u2019s go outside and take a walk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was still pondering about Wanyan Yi and Dong Lu\u2019s princess\u2019s disappearance when Wanyan Lie suddenly suggested to go out for a walk. Everyone didn\u2019t understand what the emperor was thinking, but it\u2019s difficult to refuse an emperor. The officials got up and followed behind Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty\u2026,\u201d Lin Ke Xin was a bit anxious and was worried for Wanyan Yi. If by chance, Wanyan Lie saw by accident things he shouldn\u2019t have seen, by then, Lin Ke Xin didn\u2019t know what Wanyan Lie would do.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort, go together with zhen!\u201d Not waiting for Lin Ke Xin to finish speaking, Wanyan Lie grabbed Lin Ke Xin\u2019s hand and took her out of Taiji hall.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s palm was cold making Lin Le Xin\u2019s heart startled. He was so different from his normal state. Could it be that he discovered something? Lin Ke Xin was afraid, but her mind turned constantly and planned how she should deal with what\u2019s coming.</p><br/><p>A group of people under Wanyan Lie\u2019s lead, majestically went to a sightseeing at the harem. Wanyan Lie maintained a gentle smile. However, the chillness emitting from his cold palm told Lin Ke Xin that he was in a very bad mood now.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood brother\u2026don\u2019t stop\u2026good brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is more powerful between I and Feng cang? Who do you love more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLove, love you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After walking very far, everyone heard some strange voices. It seemed to came from the imperial garden.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the imperial garden!\u201d Hearing this dirty dialogue, Wanyan Lie was surer of this thought. At this time, Lin Ke Xin\u2019s face paled immediately.</p><br/><p>Nobody understands one\u2019s son better than his mother, how could she not recognize that voice?! Wanyan Yi was at the imperial garden. Besides, he was doing that kind of thing. Lin Ke Xin didn\u2019t dare to think about how the officials would view Wanyan Yi after seeing him being so impetuous. Wanyan Yi was a candidate for the throne, ah. If he lost the public opinion, no matter how hard she works in the future, his reputation couldn\u2019t be saved!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty!\u201d Lin Ke Xin pulled Wanyan Lie. Her eyes were begging, \u201cYour majesty, this subject wife feels a bit unwell. This subject wife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know how to worry?\u201d How could Wanyan Lie really not know Lin Ke Xin\u2019s trick. It was just, the moment he thought that this pair of mother and son originally wanted to calculate Murong Qi Qi, an unknown fire was lit in Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart. That is Ming Yue\u2019s baby. They actually came up with such a plan. Really too shameless.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty! This subject wife, this subject wife begs you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being seen through by Wanyan Lie, Lin Ke Xin\u2019s lips trembled slightly. She regretted. If she had known that this man wasn\u2019t easy to fool, she wouldn\u2019t have arranged such a thing. Now, they were only separated by a wall from the imperial garden. If Wanyan Lie insisted on going in, then wouldn\u2019t the image Wanyan Yi shaped for so many years collapse?!</p><br/><p>No, couldn\u2019t be so cruel! Lin Ke Xin shook her head. Her eyes were full of begging. Your majesty, don\u2019t be like this. Yi er is your son. Please take our feelings of being a couple for more than twenty years into account, don\u2019t ruin him!</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin didn\u2019t say these words out loudly, but her eyes conveyed her thoughts to Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>All the success and failures were a thought of Wanyan Lie. If Wanyan Lie really didn\u2019t leave any room for errors, then how would Wanyan Yi face the people in the future, ah?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d How could Wanyan Lie not understand Lin Ke Xin\u2019s thoughts. Now, she knew how to regret and how to ask for mercy. Why didn\u2019t she think more before doing?</p><br/><p>Although Wanyan Lie wanted to see what that animal was doing, but after all, Wanyan Yi was his son. Besides, behind him followed the officials. The son being shamed was also because he, this father didn\u2019t taught him well. By then, he would also be involved and be laughed at because of Wanyan Yi\u2019s stupid actions.</p><br/><p>Just as Wanyan Lie intended to give up, the sound of that side spread over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen that old but still alive bastard go to the heaven, I will be emperor. By then, I will certainly make you empress!\u201d</p><br/><p>After these words spread over, Wanyan Lie\u2019s face immediately turned dark. The gaze he looked at Lin Ke Xin with seemed to have two daggers. \u201cSo, this was the calculation of you and your son!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s voice was gloomy with a monstrous wroth. Just now, he was certain and determined that the person he heard talking was Wanyan Yi. He didn\u2019t thought, that the son who was always respectful in front of him, his (WY) true thoughts would be to want him (WL) to go to heaven sooner.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, emperor, this is definitely a misunderstanding, definitely a misunderstanding\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin was also truly dumbfounded. Did feces enter Wanyan Yi\u2019s head? To actually say such disgraceful words? With great difficulty, she persuaded Wanyan Lie. She used feelings to touch him and let him abandon the idea of going to the imperial garden. She didn\u2019t expect that Wanyan Yi would say such words of searching for death at this moment! What had happened to him? Could it be that Wanyan Yi didn\u2019t know that what a sovereign was most concerned about, was when someone else was thinking about his position?</p><br/><p>\u201cF*** off!\u201d The annoyance from before coupled with the anger of now, the two fused together and hit Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart. These were the words the son he loved for so many years said. It turned out, in Wanyan Yi\u2019s heart, he, this emperor father was a \u2018old but still alive bastard\u2019!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie pushed Lin Ke Xin away and entered the imperial garden with big steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, don\u2019t, ah!\u201d Although Lin Xin was suddenly pushed away, but this one kick let her become completely sober. Seeing that Wanyan Lie was about to enter the imperial garden, Lin Ke Xin went and clung on Wanyan Lie\u2019s leg.</p><br/><p>The words of Wanyan Yi just now were really overboard. According to Wanyan Lie\u2019s personality, if he went inside so furiously, he would certainly cut down Wanyan Yi, this unfilial son! Whatever the outcome, he\u2019s a piece of meat that fell from her body. Besides, originally Lin Ke Xin preferred her eldest son. Now, seeing that Wanyan Yi was in trouble, she as his consort mother, how could she not worry?</p><br/><p>Being trapped like this by Lin Ke Xin, Wanyan Lie got angrier. This woman, usually she was weak like a cat. Now, her strength was so scary while protecting her son. Could it be that she was also calculating to let him go to heaven sooner and let Wanyan Yi become the emperor, so, she could then become the empress dowager?</p><br/><p>When he thought that there was such a possibility, the way Wanyan Lie looked at Lin Ke Xin no longer had love. No matter how good he was to this woman, in the hearts of women, sons would still come first. She actually partnered with her son to calculate his throne. Really enough is enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Lie no longer had mercy. One kick fell on Lin Ke Xin\u2019s chest. With big steps, he went into the imperial garden.</p><br/><p>It was unexpected that the emperor got angry. Some clever people probably guessed the things inside of this. It was just, no one dared to say it out.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s kick happened to fell near Lin Ke Xin\u2019s heart. Tears almost fell from pain. However, she was more worried that Wanyan Lie would kill Wanyan Yi from anger. Even if her chest hurt very much, she still stood up, stumbled and followed behind Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>The two key figures were gone. The officials stood there. You looked at me, I looked at you. Should or shouldn\u2019t they enter this imperial garden? The people couldn\u2019t reach an agreement. They looked at Feng Cang. At least, here, Nan Lin wang3 Feng Cang held the highest position.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, we better help look for princess Yun! She came from afar and is a guest. If there are some accidents, then it would be our Bei Zhou\u2019s wrongdoing.\u201d At this time, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words floated to everyone\u2019s ears. These words ignited them like a fire.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, ah! They didn\u2019t come for the scandal of the imperial family, but they came to help find Dong Lu\u2019s princess! The moment they thought of this, the nervousness of before disappeared. One after another, the officials entered the imperial garden,</p><br/><p>The moment they entered, they were struck dumb. Is, is here still the imperial garden?</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because they came to this imperial garden many times, after seeing the scene in front of them, the officials would\u2019ve thought they went to an open brothel. What\u2019s the matter with all those women lying down? And also, the land of clothes, this, this\u2026everyone was struck dumb.</p><br/><p>The officials weren\u2019t the only ones who were struck dumb. Wanyan Lie was also struck dumb. After entering, he didn\u2019t say one words. These scenes already shocked him completely. Lin Ke Xin who was just now begging for mercy for Wanyan Yi, at this moment, her mouth was wide open. Heavens! Why was it like this?!</p><br/><p>The only one who was calm was Murong Qi Qi. Even Feng Cang at this moment couldn\u2019t hold it together.</p><br/><p>In front of them, lay at least seven or eight palace maids. Their expressions showed pain. Their mouth were moaning. Seeing their appearance, they seemed to have been defiled.</p><br/><p>The ground was full of torn clothes. On some clothes, red blood could be seen. The air was filled with a decadent smell. At the other side, Wanyan Yi was still happily continuing\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? Am I awesome?\u201d They seemed to be too intoxicated. They didn\u2019t notice that behind them so many people appeared.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s hair was loose. She didn\u2019t have anything on. Her eyes were misty. Her hands held the tree in front of her tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, are you marrying me or are you marrying Feng Cang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, she received a heavy slap, but Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t seem like she felt the slightest pain. Instead, she made a \u201cwoo\u2026\u201d sound as if she was agreeing with Wanyan Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay!\u201d Wanyan Yi changed hands and slapped once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMarry you! You\u2019re a good big brother! The best, the best big brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Of course! I\u2019m the best! What is Feng Cang?! He\u2019s just a gigolo who relies on his face to eat! I\u2019m much stronger han him!</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Yi\u2019s words spread to Feng Cang, his face immediately turned a lot darker. What was called a gigolo who relies on his face to eat? Was there a gigolo like him?</p><br/><p>Sensing Feng Cang\u2019s unhappiness, Murong Qi Qi quietly said, \u201cBig brother, you\u2019re the best. Don\u2019t bother with him, the head of pigs!</p><br/><p>The words \u2018head of pigs\u2019 spread to the officials\u2019 ears by the wind. They connected this scene with the scene of pigs breeding together. When they thought about it, it was somewhat similar. Those bold laughed out loudly.</p><br/><p>At this side, Wanyan Yi was completely immersed in the world of two people. It was so wonderful!</p><br/><p>\u201cYun er, when I become emperor, I\u2019ll cut off Feng Cang\u2019s head and kick it as a ball, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026good big brother, do as you like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Er: term of endearment</p><br/><p>2. Zhen: I, used by the emperor</p><br/><p>3. Wang: the prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

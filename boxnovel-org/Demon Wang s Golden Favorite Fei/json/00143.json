Everyone wanted to see the beautiful face of the number one beauty of the world. Without a choice, Feng Cang protected Murong Qi Qi very well. They came from the backdoor. After entering the room, they didn\u2019t show their faces again.</p><br/><p>Now, the opponent for who this prettily and soft woman in front of them performed on the arena, was actually princess Zhen Guo, Murong Qi Qi. This made White Cloud Restaurant immediately explode.</p><br/><p>Who was princess Zhen Guo? That was great general Feng Xie\u2019s and princess Ming Yue\u2019s lost baby of many years. Now, although she had been found, but she never showed her face in public. In the hearts of the people, Murong Qi Qi was a girl who exuded mystery from her whole body.</p><br/><p>Now, Xia Yun Xi challenged Murong Qi Qi. Don\u2019t know if the princess Zhen Guo who was able to cause the fall of a city from the legends, would or wouldn\u2019t accept the challenge.</p><br/><p>The citizens at White Cloud Restaurant were all looking forward to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reply. Upstairs, Murong Qi Qi wasn\u2019t a bit emotionally moved. She still nestled lazily in Feng Cang\u2019s arms. Her beautiful phoenix eyes narrowed as if she was a lazy and asleep cat.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a long while, there was no movements from upstairs. Xia Yun Xi got a bit nervous. Could it be that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t dare to perform with her on the arena? Then what should she do? Stand here like a fool?</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Zhen Guo, this little girl wants us to learn from each other! Don\u2019t know if princess Zhen Guo could give this little girl face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s soft voice floated to upstairs. Murong Qi Qi opened her phoenix eyes. Her mouth revealed a charming smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, who are you? What face? Why should bengong give you face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cold and lazy voice spread from upstairs to downstairs. Her voice revealed a dignity that people couldn\u2019t ignore, but it didn\u2019t hurt the elegance and sweetness of her voice. Just listening to this voice, it would let people\u2019s heart feel like summer and fresh like a cool and fresh water suddenly went into it. It also let the spectators more curious and want to see Murong Qi Qi\u2019s genuine appearance.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, that was her character! Murong Qi Qi declining Xia Yun Xi attracted the chuckle and shaking of the head from Ming Yue Cheng. She must\u2019ve long knew Xia Yun Xi\u2019s identity. That was why she deliberately said so. However, that Xia Yun Xi was also too stupid to actually challenge Murong Qi Qi. In the end, how would this matter end? Ming Yue Cheng already defined that in his heart.</p><br/><p>After hearing Murong Qi Qi, Xia Yun Xi\u2019s face paled. She didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi would so not give her face. She (MQQ) \u2018humiliated\u2019 her (XYX) like this in public.</p><br/><p>Princess\u2026Seeing Xia Yun Xi\u2019s expression, Hong Ye broke into cold sweats for her princess.</p><br/><p>Since small, Xia Yun Xi was pampered. She got everything she wanted. She had never encountered setbacks and also never failed. Now, she was determined to win Feng Cang. However, the moment she came, she was displeased by Murong Qi Qi. How could princess bear this?!</p><br/><p>Originally, Hong Ye thought that Xia Yun Xi would back out of an awkward situation. She didn\u2019t expect that she (XYX) still maintained a gently smile and still stood on the arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Zhen Guo, the rule of White Cloud Restaurant is, if challenged, one must accept. Otherwise, it\u2019s admitting defeat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi advanced by retreating and wanted to force Murong Qi Qi to appear. However, her words just fell, Murong Qi Qi threw some words down, \u201cThe rule of White Cloud Restaurant can\u2019t control bengong. You also know bengong is princess Zhen Guo. How could White Cloud Restaurant\u2019s rule bound the two words Zhen Guo?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Wanyan Kang gave Murong Qi Qi a thumb-up.</p><br/><p>Although, Wanyan Bao Zhu was also an imperial princess, but compared, Murong Qi Qi had more aura of a princess. These words being thrown out, immediately smashed a few people. Even if people weren\u2019t satisfied, but they couldn\u2019t do anything to her because she\u2019s princess \u2018Zhen Guo\u2019 who Bei Zhou\u2019s emperor bestowed personally!</p><br/><p>It could be considered that Xia Yun Xi now have experienced Murong Qi Qi\u2019s difficulty to deal with. However, she wouldn\u2019t give up. Feng Cang was in that room. Maybe he was looking at her now. The thought that Feng Cang was at close proximity, her heart got infinite power and very strong courage, \u201cPrincess, could it be that you rely on your identity to take unfair advantage of others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A string of crisp like silver bells laughter spread to the ears of the people, cleaning the negative feelings they had for Murong Qi Qi caused by Xia Yun Xi\u2019s \u2018rely on your identity to take unfair advantage of other\u2019. Inside everyone\u2019s ears echoed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s crispy laughter. Someone who had such clean laughter, how could she be the kind of person Xia Yun Xi said?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that bengong is taking unfair advantage or is it that you\u2019re being too forceful? Mm\u2026Dong Lu\u2019s princess Yun, Xia Yun Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the opening of the window, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s figure still couldn\u2019t be seen. It was just her voice had long been firmly remembered by people. The moment they heard that the girl on the arena was Dong Lu\u2019s princess Yun, Xia Yun Xi, they came to the realization.</p><br/><p>So, this woman was the Xia Yun Xi who caused an uproar recently and came from the far away Dong Lu to marry Feng Cang?!</p><br/><p>Immediately, the way Bei Zhou\u2019s citizens looked at Xia Yun Xi changed. So, it was like this. Chasing a man to this point; the difference between the heart of this Dong Lu\u2019s princess and her external performance was too big\u2026</p><br/><p>Her identity being exposed by Murong Qi Qi was outside Xia Yun Xi\u2019s expectations. However, this woman didn\u2019t give her face, why should she care about so much?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, before Yun Xi came, Yun Xi already heard princess\u2019s good name. Yun Xi admires princess very much and always sought for an opportunity to get to know princess. Don\u2019t know if princess Zhen Guo could give bengong a chance?! Yun Xi likes to become friends with princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Yun, you don\u2019t want to become friends with bengong, but you want to become bengong\u2019s sister-in-law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you want to marry into Nan Lin wangfu, it\u2019s better to learn needlework, the feminine arts and how to manage a household. Bengong\u2019s big brother likes gentle and ladylike woman the most. Like princess Yun, showing your face in public and challenging people on the arena; if people don\u2019t know, they would think that it\u2019s a daughter of a small family and humble house. A lady of prominent families wouldn\u2019t be like this, let alone a country\u2019s princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mockery in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words were something everyone could hear. Like Xia Yun Xi, singing in public like a resenting wife, was remarkably like a woman who went crazy from wanting a man. How was this something a princess would do?!</p><br/><p>A true princess should be like Murong Qi Qi; always kept a distance from the citizens, wear a mysterious veil and shouldn\u2019t be hot tempered at the provocations of others. This was the style of royals!</p><br/><p>After comparing the two, the pros and cons of the two countries princesses had been concluded in the people\u2019s heart. The people who just now felt that Xia Yun Xi, this girl was someone worthy of their pity, after getting to know the other party was a princess and seeing that her deeds were not worthy of her identity, it immediately let her image in the public\u2019s mind collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, in this world, presumably there wouldn\u2019t be a more eloquent woman than cousin-in-law\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Wanyan Kang wanted to use \u2018poisonous tongue\u2019 to describe Murong Qi Qi, but later, the words were already on his lips, he dispelled that thought. He couldn\u2019t afford to offend Murong Qi Qi. Wanyan Kang already had a deep understanding of this. He didn\u2019t want to be a cannon fodder and be shot away by Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, do you really think like that?\u201d Murong Qi Qi looked with a smile yet not a smile at Wanyan Kang. Wanyan Kang immediately sworn, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Cousin-in-law, I really, truly, definitely think so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi called Su Yue to her side. She whispered some words in her ears. Su Yue nodded and left White Cloud Restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, what did you let Su Yue go do, ah?\u201d Wanyan Kang moved closer to her and asked quite interested. However, he didn\u2019t get close to be in front of Murong Qi Qi when he was blocked by Feng Cang\u2019s big hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep your distance!\u201d Feng Cang pointed to let Wanyan Kang stay away from Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang care about Murong Qi Qi so much, Wanyan Kang shouted, \u201cCousin brother, you weren\u2019t like this before! You shouldn\u2019t be so narrow-minded!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActing spoiled is of no use in front of me! If you want to act spoiled\u2026,\u201d Feng Cang looked at Su Mei. \u201cGo find Su Mei!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even guye teased her and Wanyan Kang\u2019s matter made Su Mei blush, \u201cGuye, what kind of joke are you making?! I don\u2019t have any relation with him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upstairs, the group of people were playing lively. Downstairs, Xia Yun Xi stood a bit awkward on the arena. Going forward was not right, backing down was also not right.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi never knew that Murong Qi Qi was someone who even salt nor oil could enter. Putting it in the past, she only needed to provoke two sentences and use an indirect psychological method to get one to do as she wished, the other party would long have stamped their feet in fury. However, Murong Qi Qi was the same as a living dough. No matter what she did, she (MQQ) didn\u2019t show up. What should she do now?</p><br/><p>Just the thought that Feng Cang was upstairs and at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side, the originally wanting to give up heart of Xia Yun Xi persisted. Only one more step, she would be able to get close to the person she loves. If she gave up so easily, didn\u2019t this mean that she wasn\u2019t a bit firm in the love for him?!</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Zhen Guo saying this, could it be you\u2019re afraid?!\u201d Xia Yun Xi stared at upstairs. She really hoped that Feng Cang\u2019s figure could appear. However, a long while after this sentence was said, no one responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Zhen Guo? Feng Qi Qi!\u201d Xia Yun Xi couldn\u2019t help and directly called Murong Qi Qi\u2019s name, but she heard a man\u2019s voice spread over.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur wangye and princess already left. Wangye had a sentence to convey to princess. Wangye asked, are you really a princess? He had never seen such a princess like you! Presumably, among the four countries, only Dong Lu\u2019s princess would be like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyi answered Xia Yun Xi from upstairs. Just now, Murong Qi Qi let Su Yue go prepare the carriage. Now, it\u2019s great. The whole group left, only leaving him to convey their words. All the thing to offend people was done by him!</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d The words Ruyi conveyed, obviously were filled with sarcasm towards Xia Yun Xi. When people heard that, they felt more and more that Feng Cang was right. In the end, they all laughed!</p><br/><p>From young till now, when had Xia Yun Xi received such humiliation. Feng Cang\u2019s words were obviously ridiculing her! Now, these commoners were also laughing at her. Really audacious to the extreme!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing at?! If you continue laugh, I will let emperor father execute you and all your relatives!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s words made the citizens more speechless. Some people shouted at a side, \u201cPrincess, I\u2019m so afraid, yo! Didn\u2019t expect that the hand of Dong Lu\u2019s emperor is stretched so long. He could actually control till our Bei Zhou!\u201d</p><br/><p>This person seemed to be deliberately provocative. Xia Yun Xi cried from anger because of these words, \u201cYou all bully me! I\u2019ll go back and tell emperor father!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a stomp, Xia Yun Xi left the arena.</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Kang told Murong Qi Qi the result, Su Mei and Su Yue laughed, \u201cYour highness, didn\u2019t expect that you have the potential to spoof. The last sentence was so funny!\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that the last sentence was deliberately left by Wanyan Kang till the last moment.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s mood was very good after amusing Su Mei. However, after thinking about it, Murong Qi Qi rejected Xia Yun Xi\u2019s challenge of the arena, that woman would definitely not leave the matter at that. He couldn\u2019t help but worry about the lovers in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin-in-law, this Xia Yun Xi is the pearl of Xia Jin\u2019s hands. She\u2019s very treasured. You humiliated her today like that, I am afraid that she wouldn\u2019t leave the matter at that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang was right, but Murong Qi Qi also wasn\u2019t afraid of Xia Yun Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, you\u2019re wrong! The one who humiliated her was herself. Besides, it was Ruyi who said those nasty words. He represented Cang\u2019s meaning. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me! Don\u2019t relate everything to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s excuse couldn\u2019t help but let Wanyan Kang sweat. Who was it that didn\u2019t go through Feng Cang\u2019s consent, directly ordered Ruyi and taught him to say those words? How could a person not admit the things he/she just done? It seemed, it\u2019s better to offend a villain than to offend Murong Qi Qi. This thought rooted deeply in Wanyan Kang\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s guess was not wrong. After coming out of White Cloud Restaurant, Xia Yun Xi almost cried back to Dong Lu\u2019s embassy.</p><br/><p>As a princess, when had Xia Yun Xi suffered such grievances? All was because of Murong Qi Qi! She had long heard that Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang\u2019s relationship wasn\u2019t ordinary. Perhaps it was her who sow dissension, causing her today to not even see Feng Cang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned Feng Qi Qi!\u201d Xia Yun Xi grabbed a small palace maid to her. She pulled a hairpin on her head and stabbed it in the small palace maid\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, spare me! Princess, spare me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The small palace maid quickly protected her body, but she didn\u2019t expect that her act of dodging would anger Xia Yun Xi more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI let you doge! I look at how you dodge!\u201d Xia Yun Xi clutched the small palace maid. She exerted strength to stab the small palace maid\u2019s body. In no time, there were more than a few blood holes on the small palace maid\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, cool down your anger!\u201d Knowing that her princess began to torture people again, Hong Ye quickly went forward to pat Xia Yun Xi\u2019s back and massage her shoulders. At the same time, she gestured with her eyebrows to let the small palace maid leave quickly.</p><br/><p>With Hong Ye\u2019s saving, the small palace maid quickly wiped her tears, kowtowed and thanked for this grace. She quickly went out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong Ye, did you see? Today, they were laughing at me! They all looked at me as a joke! If at Dong Lu, I would certainly let emperor father cut all their heads off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although, Xia Yun Xi always used dirty ways on her palace maids, but to her confidante Hong Ye, she valued her very much. Being at her (XYX) side for so many years, Hong Ye didn\u2019t suffer physical pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t be angry anymore! Today didn\u2019t work, but isn\u2019t there future?! Bei Zhou plans to hold a palace banquet. This is a good opportunity, ah! Princess, you could grab this chance and overwhelm everyone, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Ye knew the temper of this princess. She could only stroke in the direction the hair was going. If she went against her (XYX) wishes, the one who would suffer and be put in a lot of trouble would still be her. Perhaps, she would even lose her life because of this.</p><br/><p>Hong Ye successfully changed the subject, making Xia Yun Xi\u2019s frustration reduce slightly.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s thing was a bit reckless, that was why it became information that could be turned into a joke by Murong Qi Qi. Wait until they\u2019re at the palace banquet and in front of the monarch and the ministers. If Murong Qi Qi \u2018retreats and escapes\u2019 again, then that\u2019s cowardice!</p><br/><p>After untying the knot in her heart, Xia Yun xi was full of confidence again. No matter what, today she had showed her face. Feng Cang certainly had seen her. Wait until the palace banquet; when she brings out her implicit and innate qualities, Feng Cang would definitely like her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong Ye, before Feng Qi Qi became princess Zhen Guo, she was just a rubbish. How come today listening to her, she wasn\u2019t in line with a rubbish, ah?! Tell me, on the palace banquet, in front of so many people, would she reject me like today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, she\u2019s only eloquent. In other areas, she\u2019s certainly not as good as you! At the palace banquet, if you proposed a competition, she wouldn\u2019t refuse. She could fool the citizen. If she wants to botch you like today in front of the officials and the emperor, she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to lose this face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Ye\u2019s words was like a reassurance making Xia Yun Xi\u2019s mood very good. Feng Qi Qi, you wait and see! The position of Nan Lin wangfei is mine for certain! No matter if you admit or don\u2019t admit, I will be your sister-in-law!</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi just returned to Nan Lin wangfu and the two just entered Tingsong building, they sensed the strangeness. The two exchanged a glance and pretended that there was nothing. One went to the desk, the other went to the bed. However, when they were about the reach their destination, the two turned around at the same time.</p><br/><p>The plum dart in Feng Cang\u2019s hand and the golden thread in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand shot out at the same time and went straight to the roof.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang\u2026\u2019 sounded. The plum dart had been knocked down to the ground. A person in black appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Murong Qi Qi\u2019s golden thread wrapped around the other party\u2019s neck as if, if the other party moved a bit, the other party\u2019s head would be cut off by her golden thread.</p><br/><p>Feng Xie looked at the Murong Qi Qi in front of him. The more he looked, the more he felt love. Even if his life was now still in her hands, but this is his biological daughter, ah! Just now, Feng Cang used a plum dart to attract his attention and help Murong Qi Qi succeed. These two people coordinated really flawlessly!</p><br/><p>\u201cSay! Who are you! What did you come here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the masked black person didn\u2019t speak, the golden thread in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand tightened. If the other party was an enemy, she wouldn\u2019t mind taking the other party\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi\u2026,\u201d Feng Xie\u2019s voice was somewhat bleak. He raised his hand and slowly removed the black cloth in front of his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the monk at the pagoda to drive away evil spirits?\u201d Seeing the other party\u2019s face, Murong Qi Qi was surprised. \u201cDidn\u2019t you pass away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi said that, Feng Cang also remembered. This person was the one who sent Murong Qi Qi the five-colored plum. However, why did he look this way? Why did he appear at Tingsong building? Feng Cang carefully looked at the person n black in front of him. He wanted to obtain some clues from his appearance.</p><br/><p>Although surprised, but Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t plan on retrieving the golden thread in her hand yet. She didn\u2019t know if this person was a foe or a friend. That was why she couldn\u2019t lower her guard.</p><br/><p>Feng Xie admired Murong Qi Qi\u2019s thought. Indeed, it was very important to be careful and cautious before figuring out the true identity of the enemy. In the past, he was too careless. That was why he was stabbed in the back by his good brother (friend), making his family ruined, homeless and miserable for so many years.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Feng Xie, your father.\u201d</p><br/><p>The few words from Feng Xie were like thunder, making Murong Qi Qi got a burst of dizziness. Didn\u2019t Feng Xie die? Why did he suddenly appear? Is this person real or false?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

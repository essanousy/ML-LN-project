Here is much more beautiful than Xi Qi, don\u2019t you think?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu raised her chin like a proud peacock and still refused to look at Murong Qi Qi with direct eyes.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t look with direct eyes means that WBZ sees MQQ as someone below her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi put on a blank face. She nodded but didn\u2019t say yes nor no.</p><br/><p>Although it\u2019s already winter, the snow hadn\u2019t come yet. The lake was unusually deserted. It emitted a burst of coldness. Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t know why Wanyan Bao Zhu brought her here, but looking at the expressions of those other women, she knew it was not something good. That\u2019s why she had long prepared to catch her (WBZ) next move.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wooden eyes, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t understand why Feng Cang liked Murong Qi Qi. Not only did she not understand, even Mu Yu Die and Yu Shi Shi couldn\u2019t understand why Feng Cang\u2019s taste was so \u2018unique\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, the one who first opened her mouth to make things difficult for Murong Qi Qi was not Wanyan Bao Zhu, but crown princess Yu Shi Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Qi\u2019s landscape must be very good. That\u2019s why it could raise such a delicate person as princess. Even wangye1 treats you differently. It\u2019s just, there\u2019s a sentence bengong2 doesn\u2019t know if bengong should say it or not\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You already opened your mouth, will I still be able to not let you fart? Murong Qi Qi was thinking in her heart, but on her face, she put up a respectful smile: \u201cPlease enlighten me, crown princess niangniang3.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye is excellent in both literature and military. He is the famous hero of Bei Zhou; but princess, it seems like you know nothing. If this is spread around, people will feel injustice for wangye. Although women without talent are virtuous, but she still needs to know the basics. Otherwise, when men encounter new people, it\u2019ll be very easy to forget the old one.\u201d</p><br/><p>So, it turned out that she was talking about this? Murong Qi Qi sneered in her heart, but her face showed an even more respectful smile: \u201cCrown princess niangniang is right. It\u2019s just that bengong likes embroidery and management of the household more. Bengong feels that putting oneself in someone else\u2019s shoes, in the end will get the other party\u2019s true heart. No matter how wangye treats me in the future, bengong will surely treat him wholeheartedly and will certainly not live in the wangfu4 while the heart is elsewhere; using one heart for two purposes\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words were like a strike, fiercely slapping Yu Shi Shi\u2019s face. Immediately, Yu Shi Shi\u2019s expression turned bad\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What does she mean? What does she mean by using one heart for two purposes? What does she know? Or has she heard something? Why does she know her inner thoughts\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi\u2019s face turned pale then turned red. She stood there. It wouldn\u2019t be right if she answers that; it wouldn\u2019t be right if she stood there without saying anything. She could only laugh embarrassingly.</p><br/><p>The girls present also heard some of the rumors about Yu Shi Shi and Feng Cang. Although it\u2019s not confirmed, but after seeing Yu Shi Shi\u2019s performance at the banquet; no one was blind. That\u2019s why when Murong Qi Qi said that, those girls covered their mouths and laughed.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu laughed till she was trembling. She had long known that Yu Shi Shi was a \u2018cunning plot\u2019. It\u2019s just that because of her identity, she couldn\u2019t say anything. Now that Murong Qi Qi embarrassed Yu Shi Shi, Wanyan Bao Zhu was naturally happy.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that Yu Shi Shi and Feng Cang once had an engagement. However, before the marriage, Yu Shi Shi backed off and married crown prince Wanyan Hong. Binding herself to such a big tree as the crown prince, in one single step, she became the crown princess.</p><br/><p>Ever since Yu Shi Shi backed off from the marriage, Feng Cang had gotten bad luck. For eight, consecutive years, after the first day of marriage, the next day would be the day of mourning. The position of Nan Lin wangfei[wangfei: main wife/ consort of the prince of first rank] also seemed cursed, making it that, although these women adored Feng Cang, but they were stopped by the position of wangfei.</p><br/><p>Many people attributed Feng Cang\u2019s \u2018tragic fate\u2019 to Yu Shi Shi. Because she backed off, she broke Feng Cang\u2019s fate, which resulted in that none of Feng Cang\u2019s marriages were ever fulfilled. That\u2019s why, every time there\u2019s a court meeting, no one would bother with this crown princess. In the whole upper class, her relationship with women was simply bad to the extreme.</p><br/><p>A country\u2019s crown princess got humiliated by another country\u2019s princess and it was witnessed by so many people. The more Yu Shi Shi thought about it, the angrier she got.</p><br/><p>But she is a crown princess, the future empress. She needs to remain virtuous and be big-hearted. So she acted like nothing had happened. It\u2019s just that in her heart, she hated Murong Qi Qi to death. She felt that Murong Qi Qi shouldn\u2019t expose her in public and let her become everyone\u2019s joke!</p><br/><p>Although crown princess suffered defeat and many people were laughing at her, but there were also people who helped her. The one who opened her mouth next was Mu Yu Die. She was also an old woman who waited for Feng Cang till twenty years. This woman seemed quiet and gentle, but the words coming out of her mouth were filled with thorns.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess being so virtuous is wangye\u2019s blessing. No wonder wangye is infatuated with you and there\u2019s no one else in his eyes. Especially that sentence of just now, \u2018Ruo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it\u2019 really made the people who listened to it envious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die coming to her rescue, crown princess couldn\u2019t help but look at her gratefully. And Mu Yu Die\u2019s words made the women who had just laughed at Yu Shi Shi turn to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu laughed most brilliantly just now. Now, her expression also changed the fastest. Just now, it was the spring of March. Now, it\u2019s the cold winter of December.</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die didn\u2019t feel enough with just talking. She walked to Murong Qi Qi and carefully looked at the light green cloak on Murong Qi Qi. This cloak had long before grabbed Mu Yu Die\u2019s attention. This time, after looking at it closely, in Mu Yu Die\u2019s eyes, there was not only surprise but also envy, jealousy and hate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cloak is so fine. It must be certainly from a master\u2019s hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cloak was light green. On it were four four-leaf clovers embroidered with light golden threads. This four-leaf clover was a new thing. No one had seen it before. That\u2019s why everyone was surprised and the embroidery also made people praise it. The person wearing the cloak only needed to move a little bit and she would be glittering like the sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a new cloak from Jue Se Fang. Wangye ordered it early on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words were to the point. Everyone understood the value of this cloak.</p><br/><p>Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai were the most favorite places of the women of this world. Although Tong Bao Zhai already has a branch in Bei Zhou country, but Jue Se Fang did not. This meant that Feng Cang prepared this cloak when they were in Xi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this type of leaves called? I\u2019ve never seen it before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die pointed at the four-leaf clover on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cloak.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this is a four-leaf clover and they are also called lucky clovers. From ten thousand three-leaf clovers, there\u2019s only one four-leaf clover. Legend has it that the person who can find a four-leaf clover will always be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice was like gurgling spring water; sweet and moving. After hearing her explanation, they had a new understanding of four-leaf clovers and felt that these four-leaf clovers are a special plant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did princess hear this from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die claimed to be the most talented woman. In this group, she was the most talented. That\u2019s why she wouldn\u2019t accept Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the shopkeeper of Jue Se Fang who told wangye. Then wangye told me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mentioning Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s smiling face blushed. Her eyes were filled with happiness, making Mu Yu Die who saw it feel like a knife is cutting into her heart. However, it seemed like Murong Qi Qi did it intentionally. From time to time, her eyes swept over Mu Yu Die. This made Mu Yu Die\u2019s heart feel even more uncomfortable, but there\u2019s nothing she could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye is really good to princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die smiled awkwardly. She took a deep breath in her heart and also comforted herself. She (MQQ) is nothing but a slut. She should not lower herself to her (MQQ) level! She should not spur into action by her (MQQ) remarks!</p><br/><p>\u201cEn,\u201d Murong Qi Qi continued to nod and act like a shy girl, making Mu Yu Die, who was self-regulating, angry till she gritted her teeth. Mu Yu Die\u2019s forced expression made Murong Qi Qi very happy.</p><br/><p>She is but an old woman and she still dares to want things? Does it even matter if you had anything to do with Feng Cang before? What does your high status matter? What does your talent matter? Now, there\u2019s her (MQQ). She has to take care of all these small mosquitoes and flies! Not to mention such an old woman!</p><br/><p>(Emituofo, don\u2019t attack at the case of the woman\u2019s old age. In that era, 20 years old is already an old lady)\u2014from the author</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi viciously classified twenty years old Mu Yu Die as \u2018old woman\u2019. If Mu Yu Die knew that in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart, she, who was as beautiful as a flower, was nothing more than an old woman, she would definitely cough blood from anger\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the shopkeeper of Jue Se Fang say that they will open a few stores in Bei Zhou by the end of the year. By that time, there will be many of these beautiful cloaks.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Qi Qi did not forget to advertise for her Jue Se Fang.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, after hearing that Jue Se Fang will open stores in Bei Zhou, these women became excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know when?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu grabbed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand in excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, you hurt me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi frowned. Wanyan Bao Zhu pouted. In her heart, she felt that Murong Qi Qi was too fragile and weak. She looked down on her even more.</p><br/><p>After Wanyan Bao Zhu let her go, Murong Qi Qi smiled softly: \u201cI also don\u2019t know the specific date. I just heard that it\u2019s at the end of this year. It\u2019ll catch up with the new year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Say a vague time to let everybody long for it. Everyone here today are ladies and young masters of noble families. Let them spread it out, before long Jue Se Fang\u2019s fame will spread greatly in Bei Zhou. When they finally open, she will then earn many gold and silver.</p><br/><p>For a time, the ladies were immersed in the fantasy of Jue Se Fang.</p><br/><p>Before, when Tong Bao Zhai opened in Bei Zhou, it was very lively. Because there were too many people, shopkeeper Fang Kui couldn\u2019t help but use the auction way to sell the jewelries. The result was that all the jewelries were quickly gone and the revenue was much higher than expected.</p><br/><p>Those jewelries, not to mention the exquisite materials used, only the wonderful designs made people love it too much to part with it. They loved them so much that they weren\u2019t willing to put them down.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, on that day of the auction, one set had been bought by Feng Cang. It\u2019s the \u2018Autumn flower\u2019 that Murong Qi Qi wore before. The set \u2018Clear moon\u2019 was bought by Wanyan Lie. He gave it to noble consort Yue Lan Zhi.</p><br/><p>\u2018Autumn flower\u2019. The moment she thought about \u2018Autumn flower\u2019, Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart would have a knot.</p><br/><p>She had just taken a fancy to that jewelry and didn\u2019t even have time to shout a price, when it was bought directly by Feng Cang\u2019s subordinates at a high price. Later on, he gave it to Murong Qi Qi and let her shine at the banquet in Xi Qi. Really, such a good jewelry was wasted!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Bao Zhu asked Murong Qi Qi directly: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wear \u2018Autumn flower\u2019 today?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she asked that did the others know that the set of jewelry was at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s. Immediately, their eyes, as they looked at her, turned into \u2018envy, jealousy and hate\u2019. Tong Bao Zhai\u2019s jewelries was famous throughout the world and priceless. What does she, Murong Qi Qi, has to be able to wear \u2018Autumn flower\u2019 that was personally designed by Guang Hua gongzi5?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye said that Autumn flower is too heavy. Wearing it too long is not good for the neck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pushed everything on Feng Cang. Anyway, no one would dare to go verify with Feng Cang. No matter what she said, it wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>The look of Murong Qi Qi today was very fresh. Every jewelry was made by grinding furong stone (crystal); compact yet elegant. It\u2019s just that no one knew this furong stone. So, they didn\u2019t see it as a rarity and it also didn\u2019t get the women\u2019s interest.</p><br/><p>white furong stone</p><br/><p>If they had the foresight and knew that Tong Bao Zhou would soon launch a series of outstanding beautiful jewelries which all were made with the not eye-catching furong stone, they would most certainly take down all of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s jewelries for themselves.</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qi Qi\u2019s looks were ordinary, and so was her ability, but she was still a princess that Xi Qi had sent for a marriage alliance. Moreover, she kept saying wangye this and wangye that, making the people gain some good feelings for Feng Cang. The women who had fantasies about the position of Nan Lin wangfei looked at her with even more resentment.</p><br/><p>When all of those looks full of resentment fell on Murong Qi Qi, she remembered them all one by one. It\u2019s just that why hasn\u2019t anyone made a move yet? They already came to such a remote place. Presumably, there would be some women who won\u2019t be able to hold it in any longer!</p><br/><p>After walking some more, a stone arch bridge appeared before them. Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die glanced at each other. After exchanging thoughts, Wanyan Bao Zhu was the first one to stand on the stone bridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cKoi, in this season, there\u2019s actually koi! Ning er6, bring the fish food! Yong er, bring the net! Bengong wants to personally catch a few koi to hold a fish feast for giving princess Zhao Yang good luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu ordered everything. Mu Yu Die also helped. Before, when the two were against each other because of Feng Cang, they were rivals. Now, in order to deal with Murong Qi Qi, they became comrades.</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi seemed to not have seen anything. She let people put a heater and blankets in the pavilion. She also let people prepare tea and snacks. Others seemed to have a tacit, mutual understanding and helped Wanyan Bao Zhu. It\u2019s as if they were waiting to see a good show of Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, can bengong call you that? Come take a look. Now, there still are koi. It\u2019s really strange! It\u2019s certainly because they knew you were coming and came here to welcome you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu pointed at the lake and gestured for Murong Qi Qi to come over.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s \u2018Qi Qi\u2019, made Murong Qi Qi feel somewhat \u2018flattered\u2019. After hearing that there were fish seen in a winter season, Murong Qi Qi immediately became \u2018exhilarated\u2019 and went on the stone bridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere? Where are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere! Princess, come quickly and take a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that Wanyan Bao Zhu wanted to mess with Murong Qi Qi, the others quickly gave way to let Murong Qi Qi come on the bridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked curiously, while she sneered in her heart. Where was there fish in this lake? There weren\u2019t even fish scales! They led her here, could it be that they want to throw her into the lake?</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, the fish food came!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Ning er came, holding a box with fish food. That so-called fish food turned out to be whirring and meaty worms.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed that these women were already accustomed and didn\u2019t feel a bit afraid. Instead, they looked smilingly at Murong Qi Qi as if they were waiting for her ending.</p><br/><p>\u201cWo, worms\u2026\u2026.\u201d Murong Qi Qi covered her mouth. Seeing those worms, she almost vomited and her expression was very afraid, making those women prouder of themselves. Usually, they use worms to fish and were no longer surprised by them anymore. They didn\u2019t think that Murong Qi Qi would be so afraid of worms. What a joke!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know if Ning er did it intentionally or what, when she almost reached Murong Qi Qi, she slipped. The box of fish food flew directly towards Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! No\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked very distressed as if seeing those oncoming worms was very scary. Her feet also began to slip. She just took a step back when someone put her feet behind her and wanted to make her trip. If she really fell from this stone bridge, even if she didn\u2019t sprain her legs, she\u2019d still get a cerebral concussion. If the direction was a bit off, then she would go directly into the water!</p><br/><p>Humph! Really good calculation! Murong Qi Qi, without a trace of politeness, stepped on the other party\u2019s foot. After a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound, Mu Yu Die\u2019s scream could be heard. And Murong Qi Qi conveniently fell in the opposite direction, just in time to open a way. All those worms flew toward Wanyan Ba Zhu and Mu Yu Die.</p><br/><p>It happened that while the worms were flying towards them, Mu Yu Die\u2019s mouth was open, which caused her to swallow five or six worms.</p><br/><p>\u201cOu\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Mu Yu Die has forgotten about the pain on her foot. She immediately went to a side of the stone bridge and began vomiting. And when she turned, just at the right time she happened to bump into Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for the people to understand, Wanyan Bao Zhu was bumped into the lake by Mu Yu Die.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Princess, princess! Servants! Quickly come! Princess has fallen into the lake!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning er was the first one to react. She quickly began to shout.</p><br/><p>The moment Mu Yu Die saw that she had bumped into the princess, making her fall into the lake, she was so afraid that she forgot to vomit. She also forgot about the worms she had swallowed and even ignored the pain on her foot. She immediately reached out, wanting to pull Wanyan Bao Zhu up: \u201cPrincess, grab my hand! Grab my hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Mu Yu Die shouted, everyone became anxious. Falling into the water in this weather, not to mention the fact that Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t swim, even if she could swim, she would\u2019ve been frozen terribly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me! I don\u2019t know how to swim! Save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu splashed about in the cold lake water. The bone-piercing cold made her whole body hurt.</p><br/><p>When she saw Mu Yu Die reach over, Wanyan Bao Zhu did her best to extend her hands, wanting to grab onto Mu Yu Die\u2019s hands. However, she didn\u2019t expect that just when she almost grabbed the hands, she would lose strength and fall back. A few mouthfuls of cold water repeatedly went into her stomach.</p><br/><p>Damn! She certainly did it intentionally!</p><br/><p>The moment the thought of Mu Yu Die bumping her into the water hit her, Wanyan Bao Zhu felt immense hatred for the Mu Yu Die who kept shouting \u2018princess, grab my hand\u2019. For who is she acting? It\u2019s obviously you who made me fall into the lake, now you are acting like that. Really didn\u2019t think that you are the most underhanded person!</p><br/><p>When Mu Yu Die once again reached out her hand, Wanyan Bao Zhu took a deep breath and in a momentum, strove to grab Mu Yu Die\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI caught the princess! Come help quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die was very happy. She reached out her other hand to pull Wanyan Bao Zhu, but unexpectedly when everyone came over, they touched her injured foot. At that point, Mu Yu Die\u2019s foot felt immense pain. So painful that her face changed color. She couldn\u2019t help but relinquish her grip.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Mu Yu Die still wanted to \u2018play\u2019 with her, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She tightly grasped Mu Yu Die\u2019s hand and then pulled her into the lake with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet you trick me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu fell into the lake before Mu Yu Die. Now, she had almost adapted to the coldness of the water. Only Mu Yu Die, who had just fallen in, became numb because of the cold water. Taking advantage that Mu Yu Die was still adapting, Wanyan Bao Zhu put her arms around Mu Yu Die\u2019s neck, pressing Mu Yu Die in the water.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet you trick me, bitch! Dare to trick bengong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Yu Die didn\u2019t understood the situation yet, as she had already been pressed into the water by Wanyan Bao Zhu and drank a few mouthfuls of water. When she came to understand that the other party was \u2018repaying kindness with hatred\u2019, Mu Yu Die also got angry. She grabbed Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s hair and began to fight with her in the water.</p><br/><p>At this point, the scene became more chaotic. And Murong Qi Qi, who nearly fell onto the ground after being pushed off the stone bridge by people, was saved by someone. It\u2019s a man? Just as she sniffed the ambergris fragrance on the other party\u2019s body, Murong Qi Qi had already fallen into the arms of the other party.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

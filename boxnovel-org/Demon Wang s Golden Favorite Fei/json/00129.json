Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji also came with him.</p><br/><p>Originally, Longze Jing Tian had to return to his country. However, after Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity was exposed, he stayed put. Taking Murong Qi Qi as wife was his wish. If he didn\u2019t achieve this, then he wouldn\u2019t give up.</p><br/><p>As for Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji, they were more worried about Murong Qi Qi. No matter if it\u2019s Murong Qi Qi or Feng Qi Qi, in Li Yun Qing\u2019s and Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s eyes, she was the person they cared about.</p><br/><p>They were shocked at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s true identity. The two wanted to visit Murong Qi Qi at Nan Lin wangfu,1 but they were stopped by Feng Cang\u2019s people. Only because of the empress dowager\u2019s birthday were they able to see her.</p><br/><p>It was just, after seeing Murong Qi Qi, no matter if it was Li Yun Qing or Shangguan Wu Ji, their hearts received a huge impact. No matter how exaggerated the rumors were outside, no matter how noble Murong Qi Qi\u2019s real identity was, it wasn\u2019t as real as seeing it with their own eyes.</p><br/><p>Aside from that pair of eyes, which was still as quick-witted as before, this person\u2019s facial features had changed completely. They couldn\u2019t see the \u2018original\u2019 appearance anymore.</p><br/><p>It turned out that she was such a beauty\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the Murong Qi Qi sitting beside Feng Cang, Li Yun Qing was in trance for a while. That pair of man and woman was like immortals. If it wasn\u2019t because the blood relationship hindered, they would\u2019ve been the most suitable people of this world. It was just, fate played with people, making such a change happen\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, Shangguan Wu Ji finally understood why he and Murong Qi Qi always brushed past each other and didn\u2019t have any intersection. Because, between them was the hatred of Feng clan and Shangguan clan.</p><br/><p>All the outstanding males of Shangguan clan died on the battle at Yandang mountain. The one who led Bei Zhou\u2019s army back then was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s father\u2026Feng Xie.</p><br/><p>If, before Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity had been exposed, she\u2019d let him take her away, Shangguan Wu Ji would\u2019ve taken Murong Qi Qi away without turning back. However, after seeing such a Murong Qi Qi now, seeing the identity behind her, a thing called \u2018persist\u2019 of the clan instantaneously collapsed in Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Why? Why not leave him with a beautiful memory? Why cast a steel wall between them to separate them?</p><br/><p>Since he was young, Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s dream was to become a great general and beat Bei Zhou.</p><br/><p>For this dream, he bore many hardships and sweated a lot. Once, he even thought about going against Feng Cang for Murong Qi Qi. However, now these two people were actually siblings. Murong Qi Qi was actually Feng clan\u2019s daughter. This made Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s footsteps for revenge be stiffened and he wasn\u2019t able to move forward, but also couldn\u2019t move backwards\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking from afar at the happy smile on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face, Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s heart was in very much pain. Even if he persisted, those lives of Shangguan clan, who\u2019d died at Feng Xie\u2019s hand, and those black tablets in Shangguan clan\u2019s ancestral hall would let him unable to persist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Ji, let go\u2026,\u201d Li Yun Qing seemed like he understood Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s thoughts. \u201cDisregarding the hatred between the countries and the families, if you love her, you should wish for her happiness, isn\u2019t right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing\u2019s words heavily hit Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Letting go was difficult. Picking up was also difficult. If one day, he and Feng Cang confronted each other on the battlefield; she as Feng clan\u2019s daughter would certainly stand at Feng Cang\u2019s side. How could he attack the woman he loves?!</p><br/><p>Bei Zhou\u2019s officials didn\u2019t bother with the thoughts of Xi Qi\u2019s subjects. Their attention was on Murong Qi Qi. Although in this world, there were many beauties, but such a beauty like Murong Qi Qi, who was capable of causing the downfall of a city or state, was very rare.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d inherited her mother Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s beauty, but that pair of unyielding eyes was very much like Feng Xie\u2019s. Just looking at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s appearance made everyone certain that this girl was truly Feng clan\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>Everyone was paying attention to Murong Qi Qi. Only Wanyan Bao Zhu pressed her lips tightly together.</p><br/><p>Since the moment Longze Jing Tian had arrived, her eyes had been locked on Longze Jing Tian. No matter if she was Murong Xin Lian or Wanyan Bao Zhu, she wanted to sit on the position of Jing wangfei2 But ever since Longze Jing Tian had appeared, his eyes had been looking at Murong Qi Qi, full of love. How could Wanyan Bao Zhu accept this?</p><br/><p>That woman, when she was Murong Qi Qi, she\u2019d already spoiled her good matter. Now that she became Feng Qi Qi, she still attracted bees and butterflies. So hateful! Could it be that this woman was born to restrain her? She wasn\u2019t resigned! She couldn\u2019t accept it!</p><br/><p>Thinking about all the things she\u2019d suffered because of Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart would be in pain. She must get this shame back! She couldn\u2019t not calculate this bill!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Bao Zhu looked at the empress dowager who was sitting in a high place. Today was the empress dowager\u2019s birthday. Everyone would offer their gift. She had long prepared her gift. By then, she must defeat Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>Since it was Dongfang Lan\u2019s birthday, this palace feast was exceptionally lively. Above were the emperor and empress. Below were the princes and princesses. Everyone needed to prepare a gift for Dongfang Lan. When it was Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s turn, her gift was a string of red sandalwood Buddha beads.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial grandmother, granddaughter polished these beads one by one and the word \u2018Buddha\u2019 was also carved one by one by granddaughter. Granddaughter also specifically invited a monk to bless them!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s Buddha beads were presented, Dongfang Lan liked them very much. She repeatedly said, \u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBao Zhu is very sensible! You were thoughtful!\u201d Wanyan Lie nodded with satisfaction. The daughter being filial, for a father was a thing worthy to be happy about. In particular, every one of the red sandalwood was mellow round and artificially grinded. She must\u2019ve spent some time on it. It seemed that Wanyan Bao Zhu must\u2019ve long begun to prepare for this gift!</p><br/><p>The princess\u2019s gift received the empress dowager\u2019s and the emperor\u2019s approval. The officials also went along and, one by one, praised princess\u2019s filial piety. Listening to these words, Wanyan Bao Zhu didn\u2019t reveal a proud face. She still had a look of modesty.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo arrogance, good! Bao Zhu is big and sensible now. Zhen3 is very pleased!\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Wanyan Lie looked at Longze Jing Tian. He\u2019s quite satisfied with this Xi Qi\u2019s wangye.4 At least, he has the talent and looks. In the future, he may get the throne. Before, Wanyan Bao Zhu had shown her love for Longze Jing Tian. Since his daughter liked him, he, as the emperor father, should match them.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing wang, zhen heard that your marriage hasn\u2019t been arranged yet! Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve someone you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s sudden words pulled Longze Jing Tian out of his thoughts. He immediately stood up and bowed at Wanyan Lie, \u201cBenwang5 fancy Bei Zhou\u2019s princess\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Feng Cang\u2019s hand paused and his eyelashes dropped slightly. The hand scratching Murong Qi Qi also stopped, \u201cQing Qing, that stinky fly is damn annoying!\u201d</p><br/><p>To Feng Cang\u2019s jealousy, Murong Qi Qi would like to give a kiss as consolation. However, now they were in public. Because of their identity as siblings, Murong Qi Qi could only turn her hand. Her fingers gently touched Feng Cang\u2019s palm. \u201cCang, you should be happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d Feng Cang raised an eyebrow and looked at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s pink face. If it wasn\u2019t because there were many people around, he would\u2019ve like to bitten her and get a taste of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means your eyes are good! The more people who like me, the more it proves that you\u2019ve good eyes and picked the best treasure of this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Towards Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words, Feng Cang could only reach out and pinch her nose. \u201cWhy is it that every time in front of Qing Qing, I would get a clumsy tongue? Could it be that Qing Qing was sent by the heaven too restrain me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right! Before I came, god told me that my mission in this life is to let you surrender and save the girls from water and fire. By then, I won\u2019t need to go to hell. Now, I gave up my everything and went into your prison in order to let you surrender.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare for Murong Qi Qi to say so many sweet words. It made Feng Cang like her even more. Though they got along before, Murong Qi Qi was always too reserved and somewhat wasn\u2019t able to let herself go. Ever since they began to live and sleep together, the defense of this little woman collapsed bit by bit. This was good news!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, you\u2019re too right!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s lips went to Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ear and gently whispered in her ear. The hoarse manly voice full of temptation with a light heat surrounded Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ears. It teased her hearing and the sense of touch around her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince your mission is like this, why don\u2019t I help you to the end? Tonight, you can let me surrender!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s words made Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face turn completely red. She wasn\u2019t a two or three years old child and also passed the ignorant period. She could feel the piece of hotness pasted against her body every night.</p><br/><p>This man abided to his promise and waited for her to open her mouth. He waited for her to give herself to him. So, even if he was stirring, but he suppressed his feelings of wanting her. He just hugged her and never stepped over the line.</p><br/><p>Now, he said it in the open making Murong Qi Qi a bit shy. Not a while later, in her eyes was a cloud of fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Qing Qing\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Feng Cang had the mind to throw himself on Murong Qi Qi. Those ill-intentioned eyes deeply irritated him and made him unable to be the gentleman, unable to wait any longer; making him wish he could return to the wangfu now, press her on the bed and make her whole body full of his marks. So, those stinky men wouldn\u2019t put their thoughts on his Qing Qing again.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Murong Qi Qi nodded her head shyly. Her words made Feng Cang stunned for half a day.</p><br/><p>What did he hear? His little woman actually said \u2018good\u2019? He didn\u2019t hear wrong, right?! Feng Cang was stunned. His eyes looked with disbelief at Murong Qi Qi. He thought Murong Qi Qi would be like usual and say no shyly. He didn\u2019t expect that she would suddenly say good. It wasn\u2019t that he had heard wrong, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, did you understand my meaning?\u201d Feng Cang licked his dry lips, \u201cThe surrender I talked about, do you know what that meant?\u201d His surrender was not the \u2018deliver all living creature from suffering\u2019 from the Buddha teachings. What he wanted was to cross her river\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnoying!\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s questions made Murong Qi Qi turn her face to not look at that devilishly beautiful face and let herself be tempted by this man.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy for her to summon the courage to agree. This man still foolishly asked if she understood the meaning of his words. Could it be that she looked like a white rabbit who didn\u2019t know anything about the world? Or, was he forcing her to say those words which will let people blush?</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, say, ah. Say what your meaning is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi completely made all the itchiness of Feng Cang\u2019s heart come. He was like a child and wrapped himself around Murong Qi Qi. He had to hear exactly what she meant. He wasn\u2019t sure if Murong Qi Qi had truly agreed. Was it really so simple and so easy? It was so simple that he began to doubt his hearing!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang gently shook Murong Qi Qi\u2019s sleeves. How pitiful his expression could be, was how pitiful it was. Especially since that devilishly beautiful pair of eyes was full of whining. This sweet honey wrapped around Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Feng Cang to finish, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s voice was heard, \u201cThe person benwang fancy is princess Zhen Guo and not princess Bao Zhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if Feng Cang still wanted to be sweet with Murong Qi Qi, but after hearing the words \u2018princess Zhen Guo\u2019, he also stopped. It turned out that when this couple was flirting, Wanyan Lie proposed to let Wanyan Bao Zhu marry Longze Jing Tian. He didn\u2019t expect to be refused by Longze Jing Tian on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenwang objects!\u201d Without being able to take much into consideration, Feng Cang stood up and interrupted Longze Jing Tian. \u201cBenwang doesn\u2019t agree!\u201d</p><br/><p>For a time, the atmosphere was pushed to the highest level. Nan Lin wang going against Jing wang was all for princess Zhen Guo. What meaning was there inside this? Everyone was fathoming in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Now, in everyone\u2019s heart, Murong Qi Qi was in an awkward position. Both men were dragons among humans. They both fought for her and both had some relation with her.</p><br/><p>One was Longze Jing Tian who had a marriage arrangement with her and also the one who wrote the \u2018breaking off engagement letter\u2019. The other was Feng Cang who\u2019d married her and ended up with the identity of siblings. Speaking of this, both were closely related to Murong Qi Qi. Now, the two were fighting. There would be a good play to watch!</p><br/><p>\u201cNan Lin wang, benwang loves your little sister from the bottom of my heart\u2026\u201d While saying \u2018little sister\u2019, Longze Jing Tian deliberately highlighted the two words as if reminding Feng Cang that Murong Qi Qi was his little sister, that he shouldn\u2019t continue to dream and it\u2019s better to let her marry him (LJT)!</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly because Qi Qi is benwang\u2019s little sister. That\u2019s why this brother-in-law should be able to enter benwang\u2019s eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang simply didn\u2019t buy Longze Jing Tian\u2019s words. What little sister? That is just a floating cloud! Murong Qi Qi is his woman. He won\u2019t let go. Now, in Feng Cang\u2019s eyes, Longze Jing Tian, this stinky fly, was more and more displeasing to the eyes.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s overbearing manner was outside of Longze Jing Tian\u2019s expectations. Originally, he thought that Feng Cang would avoid the talk about their \u2018sibling\u2019s love\u2019 like a taboo. He didn\u2019t expect that the other party would become bold and self-confident.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenwang is asking marriage from your country\u2019s emperor. Benwang fears that you have no say in princess Zhen Guo\u2019s marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Jing directly put out Wanyan Lie. He was convinced that here, there was no one more suitable for Murong Qi Qi than him. That was why he was so confident. After all, Wanyan Lie was an emperor. As long as he opened his mouth, even if Feng Cang disagreed, he (FC) wouldn\u2019t be able to revolt!</p><br/><p>However, it seemed that Wanyan Lie also didn\u2019t buy Longze Jing Tian\u2019s words. He directly said, \u201cZhen has long promised princess Zhen Guo that she could decide on her marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, Murong Qi Qi was happy. This Wanyan Lie was really interesting. Why did she never hear about that? Now, Wanyan Lie said it like that; besides, it was in front of the officials. Could this be considered the golden mouth spoke jaded words and that this was a decree to her?</p><br/><p>\u201cThanking uncle!\u201d This \u2018uncle\u2019 came from the bottom of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart. As long as there\u2019s this decree; if there\u2019s someone who wanted to forcefully marry her, she could kill him on the spot. This was the same as giving her a protective talisman!</p><br/><p>This sweet \u2018uncle\u2019 from Murong Qi Qi made Wanyan Lie\u2019s mood very good. Because of this decree, she laughed from the bottom of her heart. This made Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart go soft. He gave her this decree, hoping that she and Feng Cang would make good use of it! He knew that kind of unrequited love very well. So, he didn\u2019t want the younger generation to also experience it.</p><br/><p>When did the emperor promise Murong Qi Qi this? Li Bing and crown prince Wanyan Hong exchanged a glance. They\u2019ve never heard about this thing. Could it be a decree given in private? If it was like that, Murong Qi Qi could decide on her marriage. The goal they wanted to achieve, could only be achieved through Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Ke Xin looked once at second son Wanyan Yi. Seeing that her son\u2019s expression was calm, Lin Ke Xin was very satisfied. Remaining calm in the face of events is the style of an emperor! No matter what, she must help Wanyan Yi get Murong Qi Qi!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s words were undoubtedly the same as rejecting Longze Jing Tian. It was just, he wasn\u2019t willing to accept it. He looked at Murong Qi Qi again, \u201cPrincess Zhen Guo, benwang has long admired you and wants to take you as my wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Longze Jing Tian didn\u2019t want to give up, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s smiling face immediately disappeared, \u201cJing wang, I don\u2019t love you. I will only marry the man I love and will only give birth to children from the man I love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can cultivate our feelings! I will wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze hurriedly said that and his eyes became eager. I beg you, don\u2019t reject me. I was wrong before! I beg you, give me one more chance! Longze Jing Tian prayed in his heart. He wished that he could hear the three words \u2018I am willing\u2019 from Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry! I don\u2019t love you! Now, I don\u2019t; in the future, I also won\u2019t. Never will I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>One \u2018never will I love you\u2019 killed Longze Jing Tian\u2019s thoughts. In just a moment, Longze Jing Tian\u2019s expression was like the dead. The original handsome face became full of injuries because of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you resent me; resent me for turning the rights and wrongs of the matter and wrote the \u2018breaking off engagement letter\u2019 to you! I was wrong! I really regret it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi frowned at Longze Jing Tian\u2019s words. It wasn\u2019t because of this reason that she\u2019d rejected Longze Jing Tian. The other party\u2019s behavior was like harrasment to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve got it wrong. I\u2019ve never have loved you. Without love, how could there be hate?! Jing wang, you think too highly of yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words made Feng Cang almost pick her up and cheer. Why did this little woman become more pleasing to the eyes, the more he looked?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said!\u201d Wanyan Kang cheered for Murong Qi Qi. He had long found Longze Jing Tian displeasing to the eyes. He\u2019d actually pushed cousin brother to a corner. He truly didn\u2019t want to live anymore! Why didn\u2019t he look at his appearance? Does he think that he\u2019s worthy of cousin-in-law?!</p><br/><p>1. Wangfu: residence of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>2. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>3.

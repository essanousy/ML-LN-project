Imperial noble consort said that it doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t find Lian gongzi1. If something happens, you still have her, she won\u2019t let the empress bully third miss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Really?\u2014\u2014Murong Qi Qi revealed a mocking smile in front of the mirror.</p><br/><p>In the past when the original owner of this body was framed by Murong Xin Lian, she didn\u2019t see Murong Xue Lian, this sister of the same father and mother, come forward to speak up for her! Now, she is worried that her position will be affected, so, she wanted to use this little trick to bribe her. Did she (MXL) still think she was the Murong Qi Qi of the past?</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, hearing these words of big sister, I\u2019ll be at ease!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi smiled sincerely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was so worried and so scared. Now that I have big sister, I won\u2019t be afraid of anything! Even if the empress comes, I won\u2019t be afraid anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing such stupid words from Murong Qi Qi, Hu Po was sure that this third miss, not only didn\u2019t have talent and ability, she also didn\u2019t have a brain. She said some more words and left the prime minister\u2019s mansion in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it really like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside Piao Xue palace, after Murong Xue Lian heard Hu Po\u2019s words, her mood was extremely good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, bengong 2 can rest assured! By the way, is there any news from Qing Luan Palace? If Qi Qi can\u2019t find Lian gongzi, how did the empress say she\u2019ll punish her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe empress will make it so that third miss can\u2019t become Jing wangfei3.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this news, Murong Xue Lian applauded. The ruby under her earlobe also shook because of her actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the result that bengong wishes for! Jing wang 4 is a popular candidate for the position of the crown prince. If he becomes the crown prince, then won\u2019t Murong Qi Qi be crown princess and in the future, the empress?Bengong hasn\u2019t even become the empress, how could she have that turn?! The crown prince\u2019s position, bengong has already set my eyes on it. This time, the empress has helped me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi rested for a few days. Originally, she wanted to let Duanmu Qing and Duanmu Yi Yi wait. She didn\u2019t expect that on the fifth day, Duanmu family would send a person to pick her up and say that Lian gongzi is at Duanmu residence. He has already cured the tendons for Duanmu Yi Yi and that Lian gongzi had asked to see her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, who is pretending to be you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the carriage, Su Yue frowned. Lian gongzi was obviously her miss, why did another Lian gongzi appear? For what kind of purpose was the other party pretending to be miss?</p><br/><p>Seeing Su Yue\u2019s oval face with furrowed brows, Murong Qi Qi reached out her hand to touch her eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoever he is, counter the soldiers with arm and the water with an earth wear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Counter the soldiers with arm and the water with an earth wear: to adopt appropriate measures to the situation</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Su Mei had known that someone would dare to pretend to be miss, she would surely dismember the other party!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi say that, Su Yue laughed. A faint dimple appeared on her left cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t bring her! She is quick tempered; you are more stable. I was worried that she will smash Duanmu residence, that\u2019s why I sent her to Tong Bao Zhai. But I\u2019m very curious about this \u2018Lian gongzi\u2019. Really looking forward to seeing him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, isn\u2019t this called the \u2018showdown of real and fake Lian gongzi\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue began to joke around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis name is not bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the master and servant chatted, they arrived at Duanmu residence. Great family Duanmu\u2019s housekeeper personally came to lead Murong Qi Qi inside. All the way, the housekeeper\u2019s attitude towards Murong Qi Qi was very respectful. Presumably it was because of Lian gongzi, making Murong Qi Qi looking more forward to seeing this \u2018Lian gongzi\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Murong Qi Qi entered the room, she saw a tall slender figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian gongzi, miss Murong has arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>The housekeeper\u2019s voice revealed his respect for this person.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi, you\u2019ve come\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After this person turned, Murong Qi Qi finally saw his face. The flowing blue clothes on this man, made him seem to be in high spirits. Sterling silver cuffs and collar buttons were perfect for calling attention. It was just that those yellow bean sized buttons must be worth a lot of money. Looking at his eyebrows, they were long like the wings of a giant bird. And that pair of slightly narrowed eyes revealed amusement but will make people unable to pry into them. High nose bridge like a towering cliff and that pair of cold thin lips are in an arc, revealing a cool thin smile.</p><br/><p>Who was this person? The precautions in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart opened. Such a handsome and cool man who didn\u2019t have a shortage of smartness, why was he pretending to be Lian gongzi? These were the doubts in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Especially that full of sentiment \u2018Qi Qi\u2019, made Murong Qi Qi got goosebumps.</p><br/><p>She was sure that she had never seen this man before. And his intimate tone full of love made everyone\u2019s eyes focus on Murong Qi Qi. Among them, there was a thirty something woman in gorgeous clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot having seen for three years, Qi Qi has become more attractive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi\u2019s soul to return to her body, Lian gongzi has already come in front of Murong Qi Qi. Long slender fingers touched Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2019ve become taller and more beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi dodged his touch and asked in a voice that only the two of them could hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lian, ah. Your Lian.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because there were people still present, Murong Qi Qi would\u2019ve surely vomit blood. When did she meet this man? And this one \u2018your Lian\u2019, if it wasn\u2019t for the people, Murong Qi Qi would\u2019ve punched his face and greet his eyes. (She means that the punch will land on his eyes)</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Qi wants to hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeming to have realized the anger in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes, Lian held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s clenched fists with a smile. The two of them stared at each other. Murong Qi Qi saw the smile in the other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to rebel, Lian gongzi pulled her to the woman in gorgeous clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things she promised empress, Qi Qi had already done them. Presumably empress wouldn\u2019t make things difficult for Qi Qi anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>So this person is the empress, Duanmu Qing?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi quickly freed her hands and bowed to Duanmu Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour subject\u2019s daughter greets the empress! Empress, long live a thousand, thousand, thousand years!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s good attitude made Duanmu Qing feel good. At the palace, she had been fighting with Murong Xue Lian. Here, her little sister treated her respectfully. This greatly satisfied Duanmu Qing\u2019s vanity.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand up! Let bengong take a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand and carefully looked at her. She didn\u2019t have Murong Xue Lian\u2019s flirtatious look. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s looks could only be considered ordinary. This made Duanmu Qing\u2019s heart feel even better.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pleasant child. No wonder Lian gongzi cares about you\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian gongzi had already taken Murong Qi Qi into his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things I promised empress, I already did them. Asking empress to not forget what empress had promised me. I\u2019ll take my leave\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Duanmu Qing to speak, Lian gongzi grabbed Murong Qi Qi and left here.</p><br/><p>After Murong Qi Qi and Lian gongzi had left, Duanmu Lei came to Duanmu Qing\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, do you believe him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, his treatment techniques that he used on Yi Yi, you also saw, it\u2019s really unheard and unseen before. Bengong has a hunch that he will be able to cure me! Big brother, bengong tried so many medicines but they had no effect. Lian gongzi is my only hope. Bengong must give birth to a crown prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he is won over by Imperial noble consort,then what? Murong Qi Qi is Imperial noble consort biological little sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Gongzi: young master/ also used to call a famous unmarried man</p><br/><p>2. Bengong: this palace, I used b the females of the imperial family</p><br/><p>3. Wangfei: the main wife/consort of the prince of first rank</p><br/><p>4. Wang/Wangye: the prince of first rank</p><br/>\n</div>"}

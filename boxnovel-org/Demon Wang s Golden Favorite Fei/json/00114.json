Feng Cang was very happy. His face showed a blissful smile. Many people had come to congratulate. In the end, Feng Cang grabbed Wanyan Kang to help him. He himself escorted Murong Qi Qi to take their leave at Wanyan Lie\u2019s. They hurriedly left the palace and returned to Nan Lin wangfu2.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress mother, see how impatient this child is. Perhaps, next year, you will be able to hold a great-grandchild!\u201d Wanyan Lie supported Dongfang Lan, \u201cNow, you can be at ease!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be or not to be at ease, still need to wait till tomorrow morning to know.\u201d Dongfang Lan was happy for Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang, but the thought of those women who\u2019d died in the past, she frowned and was very worried.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang had finally encountered a woman he loves. If Murong Qi Qi\u2019s fate was the same as those women, then wouldn\u2019t Feng Cang be ruined at one stroke? As a maternal grandmother, Dongfang Lan\u2019s love towards this only grandson (from her daughter\u2019s side) was very evident.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan\u2019s words made Wanyan Lie pause a moment. Then he laughed, \u201cEmpress mother, zhen3 feels that Nan Lin wangfei is a blessed person. Nothing would happen this time, don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm! If it truly could be the same as what emperor said, then one of aijia\u2019s 4 wishes would be fulfilled. At that time, aijia would still go to the temple. This palace is too noisy. Aijia is already old and can\u2019t stand liveliness. Aijia likes it to be quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just return? Empress mother, you should stay at the palace, so this son can show you filial piety! Since the death of Ming Yue, you have been depressed. You only stayed a few days in the palace. Zhen, as a son, feels guilty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ashamed look on Wanyan Lie\u2019s face made Dongfang Lan laugh, \u201cEmperor, you\u2019re a monarch of a country. The affairs of the country are what you should care about the most. Aijia, ah, is old and likes the quiet. Aijia\u2019s mood will become good when looking at the green hills and clear water, small dogs and small birds! You should just let aijia go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Lan already said it like that, Wanyan Lie could only nod and agree. Seeing Dongfang Lan\u2019s aged back, Wanyan Lie revealed a strange smile, \u201cJing De, is everything prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering emperor, everything is prepared.\u201d Jing De stood behind Wanyan Lie with a bowed back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! Arrange to go to Long Autumn palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>The original palace banquet prepared for Feng Cang\u2019s and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wedding didn\u2019t become cold and cheerless because the main characters had left. Instead, it became livelier.</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian drank some wine. Her small face was flushed like a red apple. She looked at Longze Jing Tian who had been drinking to drown his sorrows. Her mood also went down because of this. Why couldn\u2019t he see her? Murong Qi Qi was already married, why did he still need to torture himself like this?!</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian really wanted to use herself to warm up Longze Jing Tian, but the other party didn\u2019t appreciate it. He didn\u2019t even give her a single glance. This made Murong Qing Lian sullen. At this time, someone who looked like a palace maid came to Murong Qing Lian\u2019s side, \u201cMiss Murong, someone let this slave bring this note to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The palace maid put down the note and left. Murong Qing Lian opened the note. On it appeared a string of familiar handwriting. \u201cFourth little sister, help! See you outside the hall where the flower path is, Murong Xin Lian.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because Murong Qin Lian was familiar with Murong Xin Lian\u2019s handwriting, that she would\u2019ve believed this was a prank. However, she had fought for so many years with Murong Xin Lian; she knew Murong Xin Lian\u2019s handwriting; so, the moment she saw the note, she became startled.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian mixed into here? This made Murong Qing Lian very surprised. How come that woman is still not dead? She became like that and is still alive? Besides, she\u2019s in Bei Zhou\u2019s palace? Truly incredible!</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian looked around once but didn\u2019t see Murong Xin Lian. She felt curious and even more surprised.</p><br/><p>If she could catch Murong Xin Lian and hand her over to Longze Jing Tian to let him deal with her (MXL), then wouldn\u2019t she (MQL) attract some good feelings from Longze Jing Tian? After all, it was Murong Xin Lian who threw away all of Longze Jing Tian\u2019s face. If she catches Murong Xin Lian, the \u2018wanted criminal\u2019 who\u2019d escaped without a trace, maybe then her wish (of getting with LJT) would be able to come true!</p><br/><p>This was a happy event that had \u2018dropped from the sky\u2019. It seemed that she was destined to be Longze Jing Tian\u2019s bride! Murong Xin Lian would be her gift to Longze Jing Tian!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Murong Qing Lian stood up. She pretended to go take some fresh air and left the hall.</p><br/><p>When Murong Qing Lian followed the instructions of the note and found the flower path, the one she saw was Wanyan Bao Zhu. Murong Qing Lian was surprised. Wanyan Bao Zhu chuckled, \u201cAre you looking for Murong Xin Lian? I\u2019ll take you there. She\u2019s at my place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qin Lian\u2019s desire to catch Murong Xin Lian and take credit for it eventually prevailed her doubts of Wanyan Bao Zhu. Moreover, she has inner energy; how could she be afraid of Wanyan Bao Zhu?! Thinking till here, Murong Qing Lian pretended to be worried. \u201cPrincess, do you really know where my big sister is? She had disappeared for a long time. Our whole family is very worried about her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian\u2019s \u2018anxious\u2019 expression, Wanyan Bao Zhu sneered in her heart.</p><br/><p>Continue pretending, later I\u2019ll make it so that you won\u2019t even be able to cry out! However, on the surface, Wanyan Bao Zhu was full of smiles, \u201cShe\u2019s very well. Only her body isn\u2019t very well. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t personally come here. Follow me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Luan followed Wanyan Bao Zhu and turned a few corners in the palace. In the end, they stopped at a remote chamber.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy second big sister is here?\u201d Murong Qing Lian couldn\u2019t believe it and looked vigilantly at Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Now, she\u2019s a palace maid in the palace, but her body is weak. She\u2019s temporarily recuperating here. Quickly go in! I\u2019ll look out here for you. There\u2019s not much time. Make the long story short!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s expression was very sincere. Nothing fake could be detected. Dubiously, Murong Qing Lian opened the door. She hadn\u2019t even crossed the doorway yet, when she had been pushed inside by Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2026,\u201d Murong Qing Lian didn\u2019t get the chance to shout, when her mouth was covered by a white cloth. On the white cloth, there was an unusual taste. It made Murong Qing Lian sleepy. She didn\u2019t even take a good look at who was in front of her when she\u2019d fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone?\u201d Wanyan Bao Zhu opened the door and entered. \u201cSend her to crown prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tonight, Murong Qing Lian had a beautiful dream. She dreamed about her marriage with Longze Jing Tian. Everyone came to send their blessings. Murong Qi Qi knelt in front of them and begged for Longze Jing Tian\u2019s forgiveness. She wanted to become his bride again, but has been sent flying by a kick from Longze Jing Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would only have Murong Qing Lian as a woman, how would I still love another?!\u201d These words made Murong Qing Lian\u2019s heart feel sweeter than honey. She was woken by her laughter.</p><br/><p>The moment Murong Qing Lian opened her eyes, she found herself in a completely strange environment. Nothing was on her body. She was lying on the bed and her limbs seemed to have been tied at the four corners of the bed. Her mouth was stuffed with a cloth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp! Help!\u201d Murong Qing Lian struggled. She wanted to scream, but her mouth was stuffed. Her hands and feet were also bound. She simply couldn\u2019t escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Did you wake up?\u201d Wanyan Hong, who was only wearing a single robe, came to Murong Qing Lian\u2019s side. In his hand, he shook a wing of a butterfly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou woke up faster than this crown prince\u2019s expectations!\u201d</p><br/><p>You are\u2026the moment she saw Wanyan Hong, Murong Qing Lian was shocked. Her body struggled harder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, still want to escape, ah?!\u201d On Wanyan Hong\u2019s gloomy face appeared a sarcastic smile. The butterfly brush in his hand slowly fell on Murong Qing Lian\u2019s toe. It was as gentle as a breeze. A numbness spread through Murong Qing Lian\u2019s body. What do you want to do? Murong Qing Lian was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, this crown prince likes virgins the most!\u201d Seeing the red-like blood gecko cinnabar mark on Murong Qing Lian\u2019s arm, Wanyan Hong lowered his body. He opened his mouth and bit on the gecko cinnabar mark, \u201cSo fragrant! Only a virgin could emit such a pure fragrance! This crown prince likes it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, Murong Qing Lian finally understood what she was about to experience. No! She shook her head. Tears filled her eyes. No! I beg you, no!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Wanyan Hong seemed like he could read minds. He was able to read Murong Qing Lian\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be right?! This crown prince is already interested in you! If you don\u2019t believe it, take a look!\u201d Wanyan Hong pulled away his robe and revealed a strong body.</p><br/><p>A sense of shame emerged in Murong Qing Lian\u2019s heart. She quickly closed her eyes and refused to look. However, the butterfly brush in Wanyan Hong\u2019s hand once again fell on the back of her foot. That numbing feeling once again hit her, making her face become red from holding it in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, so sensitive! This crown prince likes it!\u201d Wanyan Hong took advantage and went on top of her. \u201cBe good, be this crown prince\u2019s woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>No, no! Murong Qing Lian\u2019s eyes were wide open, but what could she do? When a pain spread through her whole body, Murong Qing Lian had already cried a lot. Save me! Wangye,5 save me! Save me, ah!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Bao Zhu stood not far away. She looked at how Murong Qing Lian was humiliated by Wanyan Hong. She felt pleasure from taking revenge. She also wanted to let people experience what she had experienced. She also wanted to let others experience her pain\u2026</p><br/><p>It was just, when she saw the bed being tainted with red, Wanyan Bao Zhu bit her lips. So, this man could touch women and had feelings for women. Him using such sick ways to wreck her was nothing more than his disdain for Wanyan Bao Zhu because she was not a virgin!</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, a sense of shame, anger and discontent filled Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s heart. No matter what, she and Murong Qing Lian still had differences. Wanyan Hong refused to use the normal way between men and women to treat her! Thinking of the humiliation Wanyan Hong brought her, the pain from there once again pierced Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p><br/><p>She seemed to have won this time, but the one who truly won was still Murong Qing Lian, because Wanyan Hong didn\u2019t treat her (WBZ) as a normal woman!</p><br/><p>The promises Wanyan Lie made at Feng Cang\u2019s wedding deeply prodded Wanyan Hong\u2019s proud and sensitive heart. He needed to get the feeling of conquest from another\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>For example, like now. Murong Qing Lian\u2019s eyes filled with pain, her flushed face and her tears filled with hatred made his heart get a great sense of satisfaction. Now, in his eyes, Murong Qing Lian became Murong Qi Qi. Since Feng Cang stepped on him under his (FC) feet, then he (WH) would press Feng Cang\u2019s woman under his body!</p><br/><p>His eyes burned anger. Wanyan Hong had long forgotten that Murong Qing Lian was a virgin and hadn\u2019t experienced intercourse before. He only wanted to quickly vent out his anger and the injustice he felt! He vented all his dissatisfaction towards Feng Cang on Murong Qing Lian. From Wanyan Hong\u2019s point of view, Murong Qing Lian is Murong Qi Qi\u2019s little sister and Feng Cang\u2019s sister-in-law. Humiliating Feng Cang\u2019s sister-in-law is humiliating Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>At one corner in the palace, Wanyan Hong was enjoying the prey Wanyan Bao Zhu had found for him. At another corner of the palace, Wanyan Hong\u2019s father Wanyan Lie was also doing a frightening thing.</p><br/><p>In a dark room under Long Autumn palace, Yue Lan Zhi had been stripped clean of her clothes. She was tied to a wooden cross.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, what do you want to do?\u201d Yue Lan Zhi was horrified. She couldn\u2019t imagine that Wanyan Lie, who had been speaking so happily to her before, would do such a thing now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, beloved consort, don\u2019t be afraid. Zhen came to help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>On Wanyan Lie\u2019s hand was a bamboo whistle that was as long as a finger. It was the color of green jade. It looked very beautiful. Seeing this bamboo whistle, Yu Lan Zhi suddenly thought about that scene she had seen before coming down here. She\u2019d looked at the other side. A woman, who had a similar appearance to her, stood there.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Emperor, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi finally came to understand how cruel this act was. She struggled and cried. She wanted to use tears to move this man with a gentle smile in front of her, \u201cEmperor, what did chenqie6 do wrong? Why do you treat chenqie like this?! Emperor, have mercy, ah! Emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s shouting and crying, Wanyan Lie shook his head, \u201cNo, no, no. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Yue er,7 zhen likes you the most!\u201d Wanyan Lie\u2019s big hand travelled all over Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s body. He looked infatuatedly at Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s face, \u201cZhen likes you. Zhen couldn\u2019t even pamper you more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor\u2026,\u201d Yue Lan Zhi sensed the darkness coming from Wanyan Lie. The gentler this man spoke; the more terrifying the things hidden inside of him would be. A new fear spread through Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s heart. She didn\u2019t want to die! She didn\u2019t want to die, ah!</p><br/><p>The thought of that night a few months ago, she was also led here and looked at how that woman had died in pain. Yue Lan Zhi was so scared that she had lost control over urination and defecation.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk!\u201d Smelling the stench emerging in the air, Wanyan Lie frowned. He hid far away. \u201cYue er, how come you lost your propriety now? Since you\u2019re like this, what\u2019s the use of keeping you (alive)?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that Wanyan Lie wanted to use such an excuse to kill her, Yue Lan Zhi forgot the filthiness beneath her and suddenly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Inside the dungeon, Yu Lan Zhi generously laughed. It was very ear-piercing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d Wanyan Lie had never seen such a Yue Lan Zhi. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t go directly to the main subject, but looked at Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s pale face. He wanted to know the answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, I\u2019m laughing at you. I pity you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Yue Lan Zhi calmed down from the terror and tension of just now. She seemed to have seen through everything. That pair of bright eyes stared at Wanyan Lei as if they wanted to see through his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cPity zhen? What qualification do you have to pity zhen? You\u2019re only a dog zhen kept!\u201d</p><br/><p>The irony in Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s voice made Wanyan Lie very dissatisfied. He only likes people who followed him. Now that Yue Lan Zhi suddenly became like this, Wanyan Lie was not used to it and also disliked it very much.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, emperor still said you\u2019re not pitiful. Look at my face! Then look at the face of the woman lying down in the underground; you still say you\u2019re not pitiful? Hehe, emperor, you\u2019re the most pitiful person in the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou possess the whole country, but you can\u2019t possess the woman you love. Because you\u2019re siblings. You would never be able to get princess Ming Yue. So, you found all the women who looked like princess Ming Yue to satisfy your desire. Is such a person not pitiful? You\u2019re the most pitiful person in this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous!\u201d His mind being spoken out loud by Yue Lan Zhi made Wanyan Lie furious. He took out a sword and cut off Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s left arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s shrill screams seemed to have penetrated throughout the whole ground. Her arm being cut off made a layer of cold sweat emerge on Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s forehead. This woman, who had been the most pampered one in the harem, at this moment, was pale faced and sweating from her whole body like a fish who was had just been scooped out of the water. Blood flowed out of the amputated area. It didn\u2019t take long before the ground was red.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, fly into rage out of humiliation?\u2026How much is it not accepted to fall in love with your own little sister, ah?! So, you\u2019re jealous of Feng Xie. You hate him! So, you don\u2019t let Feng Cang off, because you also hate him\u2026You hid princess Ming Yue, because like that, you can get her. However, she would rather go into a deep sleep than to look at you, this sick big brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Wanyan Lie\u2019s anger had been completely lit. The sword rose once again and cut off Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s right arm.</p><br/><p>Now, Yue Lan Zhi was in so much pain that she didn\u2019t even have the strength to open her mouth, \u201cEmperor\u2026you, can\u2019t take the mother gu\u2026if I die\u2026the mother gu will also die\u2026then you won\u2019t be able to control\u2026Feng Cang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Lan Zhi slowly said that. The smile on her face was pale and her eyes were empty. She lost. Originally, she imagined getting the love of an emperor; originally, she imagined getting Wanyan Lie\u2019s true love, but these two cuts from him destroyed all of her imaginations.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

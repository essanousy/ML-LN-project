Her eyes are glaring full of hate at Duanmu Qing. Why? Why is the unlucky one her? Why is her child that she tried so hard to protect for six months gone and Duanmu Qing is unscathed?</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Beloved consort, be assured. Zhen1 will give justice to you and your child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu\u2019s mood is very terrible. All bad things stacked together. Here he hadn\u2019t appeased Murong Xue Lian yet, when there Duanmu Qing began to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er, my Yu Er. Wake up, ah! Wake up quickly, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing held Longze Yu Er\u2019s body and cried loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er, Yu Er\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just in one hour, he lost two children. Longze Yu couldn\u2019t help but look at Murong Xin Lian angrily. Everything is because of her! If it wasn\u2019t because of her, Longze Yu Er wouldn\u2019t die. Murong Xue Lian also wouldn\u2019t have a miscarriage!</p><br/><p>Sensing the killing intent in Longze Yu\u2019s eyes, Murong Xin Lian climbed to Longze Yu and kowtowed: \u201cEmperor, I\u2019m innocent! I also lost a child. That\u2019s your first grandchild, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian\u2019s words let Longze Yu\u2019s gaze shift to the long trail of blood behind her. That blood is not red like Murong Xue Lian\u2019s but dark. It seemed that there\u2019s some more to it!</p><br/><p>Longze Yu didn\u2019t believe Murong Xin Lian. Before he didn\u2019t hear anything about an imperial grandson. How come there\u2019s now suddenly an unborn imperial grandson? Immediately Longze Yu let the imperial physician inspect Murong Xin Lian\u2019s body. He wanted to know the truth!</p><br/><p>The imperial physician stroked his beard while checking the pulse for Murong Xin Lian. After a while, he changed to the right hand. After a while again, the imperial physician walked to Longze Yu and knelt down.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, Jing wang cefei2 took medicine for abortion. That\u2019s why she miscarriage. Besides this drug is strong. Ce wangfei hurt her body. I\u2019m afraid that she won\u2019t be able to get pregnant in the future anymore\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMedicine for abortion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only Longze Yu, Murong Xin Lian was also in stunned.</p><br/><p>What did she eat? Why is it like this? Murong Xin Lian forgot the pain on her body and tried hard to remember everything that happened after she entered the palace. At the end, she remembered the empress rewarding her dessert and wine!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you! It was you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian struggled to get on her feet. Her finger trembled when pointing at Duanmu Qing: \u201cI only ate the dessert and wine you rewarded. It\u2019s definitely you! Right? How can you be so heartless? Why\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s words incensed Duanmu Qing\u2019s anger. She stood up and slapped Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think you are to dare to speak like this to bengong3! Bengong didn\u2019t even pursue the charge of you murdering the princess. You actually dare to frame bengong? Servants, drag this bitch down for bengong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe empress dowager has arrived\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a group of people escorted a grey haired old lady in.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress mother, why did you come over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Shangguan Fei Yan, Longze Yu immediately went to greet her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAijia4 heard that some things happened and come over to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the blood on the ground, Shangguan Fei Yan frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress mother, you need to get justice for chenqie5!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing knelt down in front of Shangguan Fei Yan and cried hysterically.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er died, empress mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after hearing this Shangguan Fei Yan saw the lifeless body of Longze Yu Er on the ground. Immediately her expression changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Who is so cruel to kill aijia\u2019s Yu Er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial grandmother, asking you to get justice for granddaughter in law! Asking you to get justice to your great grandchild!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Duanmu Qing being the thief crying thief, Murong Xin Lian also knelt in front of Shangguan Fei Yan. Her whole body was covered in blood. Her face was pale because of the miscarriage. She looked very pitiful.</p><br/><p>After Shangguan Fei Yan understood what has happened, the cane in her hand hit the ground hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cInvestigate! Investigate throughout for aijia! Wu Ji, you take charge!\u201d</p><br/><p>The empress dowager personally commanded Shangguan Wu Ji to take charge of the investigation. Duanmu Qing didn\u2019t say anything. The four great families; she came from Duanmu family, behind Murong Xue Lian there\u2019s Li family. As for Bai family, they have always just only been merchants. Shangguan Wu Ji is then the most suitable candidate.</p><br/><p>Just in a moment, Shangguan Wu Ji already found the palace maid who send the dessert and wine to Murong Xin Lian, but she had already been silenced. The whole atmosphere became more heavy because of the palace maid\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>The person Duanmu Qing sent to send the dessert and wine to Murong Xin Lian is dead. People couldn\u2019t help but suspect Duanmu Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpress, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Fei Yan is over fifty years, but her prestige is still there.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuhou, chenqie doesn\u2019t know. Someone must\u2019ve definitely framed chenqie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing also didn\u2019t expect that the outcome will be like this, but she really didn\u2019t do anything, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian began to cry.</p><br/><p>Just the thought that because of Duanmu Qing, she won\u2019t be able to get pregnant ever again, Murong Xin Lian was full of hate till her teeth clattered. Even if Longze Jing Tian dotes on her very much, but not being able to have children, she won\u2019t have a thing to fall back on. Moreover, the disgust that Longze Jing Tian has for her is so obvious. In the future, she won\u2019t have good days anymore on Jing wangfu6</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have children, so you\u2019re jealous that I\u2019ve become pregnant. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t tolerate him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s lips trembled and she was very emotional.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now I saw with my own eyes how princess hurt imperial noble consortniangniang7 which led to her miscarriage. Now you harmed me so I lost the child. It must be because you can\u2019t see our Murong fu8 be well. That\u2019s why you used underhanded means to kill! It\u2019s definitely like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for people to understand, Murong Xin Lian rushed to Duanmu Qing. She grabbed Duanmu Qing. She rolled with Duanmu Qing on the ground and twisted into a ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous! It\u2019s obviously you who killed my Yu Er! You\u2019re just too vicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing also didn\u2019t show weakness, grabbed Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hairs and teared at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous! Really presumptuous!\u201d</p><br/><p>An empress and a wangfei9 are now like abandoned wives shouting on the streets. Really shameful! Longze Yu\u2019s face became red from anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeparate them! Separate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know if it was Duanmu Qing who was unlucky or what, when the two were separated, Duanmu Qing stepped on Murong Xin Lian\u2019s gown. Along with the two palace maids, the four fell down. Duanmu Qing was the unluckiest. She was pressed down by three people above her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s knee just happened to touch Duanmu Qing\u2019s belly. The next moment, Duanmu Qing felt pain in her belly. Immediately two hands covered her belly, but it was too late. A warm liquid streamed out along her thigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy child. My child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing such a scene, Duanmu Qing was in daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial physician, imperial physician! Come quickly. Save my child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Qing being pregnant surprised the crowd. Originally she wanted to stabilize the foetus before telling Longze Yu, but such an accident happened in the middle.</p><br/><p>\u201cNiangniang, don\u2019t grief too much\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After the imperial physician checked the pulse for Duanmu Qing, he shook his head. Just a few words broke Duanmu Qing\u2019s last hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! My son, ah\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The child she hoped to get for so many years was gone in just a moment. Duanmu Qing couldn\u2019t accept this fact. She shook her head and screamed: \u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I, used by an emperor \u21a9</p><br/><p>Cefei/ce wangfei: second ranked wife of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family \u21a9</p><br/><p>Aijia: I, used by an empress dowager \u21a9</p><br/><p>Chenqie: I, used by the wives of the emperor while talking to someone of higher rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wangfu: residence of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Niangniang:used by someone of lower rank to refer to the females of the imperial family \u21a9</p><br/><p>Fu: residence/mansion \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wangfei: main wife of a wangye</p><br/>\n</div>"}

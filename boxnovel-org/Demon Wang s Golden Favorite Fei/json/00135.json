Winter hadn\u2019t passed and spring had yet to come. The night on the mountain was a bit cold, but inside the furnace of the garret, a raging fire was burning.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much candlelight; only two candles were lit. Coincidentally, the two were actually a pair of dragon and phoenix red candles. It seemed that the owner had long premeditated or perhaps this was done inadvertently by fate.</p><br/><p>The orange light projected the figures of the people inside the canopy onto the wall.</p><br/><p>A strong shadow gently covered the delicate body. His low moans and her light sounds of flowing water made a moving love song.</p><br/><p>The sweat on Feng Cang\u2019s nose dropped on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead and became one with the sweat on her forehead, just like their love which was inseparable. Her clench made him grit his teeth and didn\u2019t dare to be violent. He was afraid that tears would fill her eyes again.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing\u2026\u201d Feng Cang never knew that the love between man and woman could be so joyful, but also so torturing. It was like, one moment, he would be in heaven. The next moment, he would fall in hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s voice held a deep sobbing tone. Even though she\u2019d tried her best to relax, but the pain couldn\u2019t deceive people. She had bit too powerfully just now and left a deep tooth print on Feng Cang\u2019s shoulder. Fortunately, in the end, she released him. Otherwise, his shoulder would\u2019ve had a row of bloody teeth marks.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the first time Murong Qi Qi had experienced this kind of feeling of running between the edges of pain and happiness. It was a feeling that was difficult to express in words. It was like standing at a beach in the summer. Sometimes, there would be winds and thunderstorms. Sometimes, the sky was blue and sunny\u2026</p><br/><p>She could only use a hoarse voice to call out his name. She put that pair of fine and beautiful small hands on his shoulders. No matter if it was painful or beautiful, she still clutched him tightly as if she wanted to use all her strength and leave her traces on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s long and black hair covered their bodies like a black quilt and didn\u2019t let that orange light peep in the slightest. Under his black hair, his strong butt constantly came forward. And she was like a vine wrapped tightly around him.</p><br/><p>If he was a tree, then she was a vine which clung to him. Her white, slender, and without any superfluous legs encircled his thin and strong waist. Along his beat, she swayed in this red ocean.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s beautiful eyes were locked on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body, which was about to burn. At this moment, her eyes only had his figure. He clearly saw his face in those dark pupils. He could even see the fire in his eyes clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang bent over, bit her lips and wantonly captured her fragrance. At the same time, his right hand grabbed her pair of soft hands and trapped them above Murong Qi Qi\u2019s head. His left hand at this time took her as a peerless piano and lightly fiddled the strings.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also love you\u2026\u201d Murong Qi Qi was already unable to distinguish if the warmth she felt was because of shyness or because of excitement. She called out his name without any strength as if she was a delicate flower blooming in front of him.</p><br/><p>This \u2018love you\u2019 became Feng Cang\u2019s biggest power. He felt tenderness towards the woman in front of him and couldn\u2019t love her enough. To express his love, aside from language, there was also action.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, it\u2019s you who found me, hooked my heart and stole my love! From today onward, don\u2019t think about getting rid of me. Life after life, you\u2019ll be mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang overbearingly declared at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ears. And she, after listening to his domineering words, she couldn\u2019t help but look at him full of love, \u201cCang, I want to give you a son! What do you think?!\u201d</p><br/><p>How would Murong Qi Qi know that her words were a complete temptation? This little woman obviously didn\u2019t know what temptation was, but it so happened that she did it inadvertently with ten thousand flirtatious expressions.</p><br/><p>Like now, her words had directly stimulated Feng Cang\u2019s senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could one be enough?\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s long and narrow phoenix eyes flashed a trace of devilishly beautiful glory, \u201cAt least three\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This night seemed particularly long. Murong Qi Qi discovered for the first time that Feng Cang had such fake pure moments. After his declaration, what met her was a violent wind and rainstorm like passion. His tenderness, modesty and cautiousness, after saying the sentence of three children, had all been swept away and he became a vigorous extremist, making her unable to do anything but cling to him tightly.</p><br/><p>Only when a slight white light came into the room, did Murong Qi Qi finally close her eyes. She was too tired. The pain coming from her waist made her want to bite Feng Cang. However, she was really exhausted and could only fall asleep while lying on his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat\u2026\u201d Feng Cang\u2019s eyes were full of the satisfaction after having eaten her. If it wasn\u2019t because this little woman was tired, he would\u2019ve wanted to continue pestering her like this.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s slender white fingers were interwoven in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hair. He dried her wet, sweaty hair. In the end, he bound her hair with his hair. \u201cBinding our hairs means becoming a married couple. Qing Qing, from today onward, you\u2019re my wife, my only lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>In ancient China, only the main wife could have the title  (Binding hairs married couple).</p><br/><p>\u201cWoo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi hummed lightly. Feng Cang thought that she had woken up. In the end, he discovered that she\u2019d only hummed once. It seemed that she really was too tired.</p><br/><p>This couple had finally became one under such a turning point. This was a happy thing. However, to the people of Wu Ji Gong, this day was a nightmare.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d When he saw his underlings had climbed inside, completely covered in blood, Wu Ji Gong\u2019s new leader Hu Min was startled. The people behind them were a group of strangers. They didn\u2019t seem to be good people.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople who have come for your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin was too lazy to talk nonsense with Hu Min. He directly waved. The people behind him flocked forward.</p><br/><p>Although Wu Ji Gong was good at using poisons, but in front of Moyu, they were somewhat childish. Fortunately, this time they had Su Yue. Towards Fo Sheng Men\u2019s people, Hu Min\u2019s poison didn\u2019t have any effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoyu, you are Moyu\u2019s people!\u201d Seeing Su Yue in front of him, the hand which Hu Min held a dagger with trembled slightly. Just now, he\u2019d been accidentally infected with the red powder Su Yue sprinkled. Now, his right hand felt painful like a burning fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Du Xian Er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Min was startled. He hadn\u2019t seen this poison before and also couldn\u2019t detox it. Seeing that Su Yue was a weak girl and also recalling the rumors from the jianghu,1 Hu Min was sure that this woman in front of him was Du Xian Er from the jianghu\u2019s rumors.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Just you? You\u2019re not worthy for our miss to use her hands against!\u201d</p><br/><p>With one cut, Su Yue cut off Hu Min\u2019s throat, surprising Nalan Xin beside her. Her hand just flicked and she\u2019d directly taken someone\u2019s life. In his heart, his impression of Su Yue changed completely. Although he knew that Su Yue and Su Mei weren\u2019t ordinary, but after seeing Su Yue\u2019s vicious side with his own eyes, Nalan Xin\u2019s heart still couldn\u2019t help but shudder once.</p><br/><p>Feeling that someone was looking at her, Su Yue turned and saw Nalan Xin. At this time, she didn\u2019t smile at him. Instead, she had a displeased expression on her face. The next moment, she attacked another person from Wu Ji Gong. Similarly, he was killed in one move, making those people, who\u2019d wanted to surround her because she was a woman, take a few steps back.</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin had already sensed that Su Yue\u2019s mood was not good on the way here. Presumably, it was because he\u2019d followed her that day, which made her angry\u2026</p><br/><p>This time, Nalan Xin knew that it was his fault, but wasn\u2019t he also forced?! Now, even Su Yue resented him, making Nalan Xin nurse a grievance.</p><br/><p>Moyu and Fo Sheng Men cooperated side by side. Everyone from Wu Ji Gong was soon eliminated. Nalan Xin led people to clean up the scene, but Su Yue went directly to Wu Ji Gong\u2019s treasure-house.</p><br/><p>These past few years, Wu Ji Gong had been doing many shameful activities. They\u2019d earned a great deal of money. After seeing the gold and silver treasures in the treasure-house, Nalan Xin was shocked. It was just, wangye2 had ordered that Wu Ji Gong\u2019s things were wangfei\u2019s.3 That was why he let him brought Su Yue over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Qing, miss said that these things need to be registered. I\u2019ll talk, you\u2019ll register!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue smiled at the somewhat thin but handsome man standing at a side, making Nalan Xin\u2019s heart feel a bit strange. Just now, she had been giving him the cold face. Now, she smiled at another man. What does she mean with this? Could it be that he was severe floods and fierce beasts?</p><br/><p>Severe floods and fierce beasts: extremely dangerous things</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin stared at the man called Wu Qing. The more he (NX) looked, the more he (WQ) became displeasing to the eyes.</p><br/><p>Firstly, this man\u2019s name was very strange. Wu Qing, Wu Qing, he must be a ruthless person; secondly, this person was not as handsome as him. Nalan Xin went over to take a look when he (WQ) was registering. His handwriting was very beautiful, but his appearance wasn\u2019t comparable to Nalan Xin\u2019s. There was no doubt on this.</p><br/><p>Wu Qing means ruthless, heartless and merciless.</p><br/><p>Such a cold-blooded and ruthless person who wasn\u2019t as attractive as him, why would Su Yue smile at him? Could it be that they\u2019re lovers? A couple?</p><br/><p>Just the thought that Su Yue and this man called Wu Qing being lovers, made a thing called \u2018vinegar\u2019 spread in Nalan Xin\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he was accustomed to that gentle like water and smiling like flower woman. Also, her soft \u2018teacher Nalan\u2019. Now, she was so cold with him, but talked cheerfully with another person. From Nalan Xin\u2019s point of view, this scene was particularly piercing to the eyes.</p><br/><p>Wu Qing was in charge of the finances of Moyu, which was equivalent to being Moyu\u2019s accountant. Using the accounting method that Murong Qi Qi had taught them, in just a while, the two had registered Wu Ji Gong\u2019s financial inventory in its entirety.</p><br/><p>\u201cBarely able to offset the loss of the two stores.\u201d After calculating the results, Wu Qing reported to Su Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! So many things could just barely offset? You didn\u2019t calculate wrong?!\u201d Nalan Xin, who had long disliked Wu Qing, after hearing this result, questioned Wu Qing\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Su Yue glanced once at Nalan Xin, but didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, she continued to discuss with Wu Qing, \u201cThen, you lead the people to take the things away. Copy one registration sheet for me. I need to give it to miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue completely ignoring him and only speaking with Wu Qing, made Nalan Xin\u2019s originally gloomy mood become even worse. Like an ignored child, he squatted at a side and looked at Su Yue and Wu Qing.</p><br/><p>After Su Yue and Wu Qing cleaned up thoroughly, Su Yue put the register away. Nalan Xin quickly stood up and came to them smilingly, \u201cMiss Su Yue, where are you going? Returning to the wangfu4 or Lion Ridge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Qing and I will first go to Moyu.\u201d It was still a cold answer. It was the complete opposite of her attitude towards Wu Qing.</p><br/><p>As for Wu Qing, he acted as if he wasn\u2019t aware of Nalan Xin\u2019s hostility. He truly was like his name; he only had one expression, didn\u2019t have joy. He was just as quiet as stagnant water, \u201cSu Yue, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only when the two figures disappeared, did a trace of melancholy flash in Nalan Xin\u2019s eyes. It seemed that they really were a pair. He thought that Su Yue was single and was even thinking\u2026forget it, don\u2019t think about it anymore. She already had a lover. No matter how much he thought, it was of no use now.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Nalan Xin suddenly somewhat understood Feng Cang\u2019s mood when Feng Cang found out that Murong Qi Qi was Du Xian Er and also thought that Du Xian Er and Guanghua gongzi5 were a couple. It was just, was the bad taste in his heart, the jealousy from the legends? This taste was truly f****** uncomfortable!</p><br/><p>It seemed that love truly was a sad poison. It\u2019s better if he did not touch love. Thinking about the fact that Su Yue didn\u2019t turn back to look at him as she left, Nalan Xin\u2019s throat choked badly. Thinking about that time under the moonlight, when Su Yue looked back with a smile like a hundred charms were born. It was like a cat was scratching in Nalan Xin\u2019s heart; how uncomfortable it could be was how uncomfortable it was.</p><br/><p>In just a short night, Wu Ji Gong was completely removed from the jianghu. Everything from Wu Ji Gong had cleanly disappeared as if in this world, this sect had never even existed\u2026</p><br/><p>Inside the palace at the capital, Nan Lin wang didn\u2019t go to the morning court. This made the officials surprised. Although this wangye\u2019s body wasn\u2019t good, when he could persist, he would come to the morning court and never missed one unless he was sick.</p><br/><p>Today was an exception. The sun had definitely come out from the west! Yesterday, Nan Lin wang had left with princess Zhen Guo. Today, Feng Cang didn\u2019t appear. There was indeed something worth thinking about inside these actions.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie frowned and looked at the place where Feng Cang had usually stood. Now, it\u2019s empty. He was somewhat not used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing De, sent someone to Nan Lin wangfu to see what has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>When that person returned and told Wanyan Lie that Feng Cang didn\u2019t return to the wangfu for the whole night and princess Zhen Guo also didn\u2019t return, after hearing this, his face showed a trace of joyful smile. It was with a bit of happiness and also with a bit of loneliness.</p><br/><p>After the court meeting, like usual, Wanyan Lie mightily went to Long Autumn palace with Jing De.</p><br/><p>The Long Autumn palace, now without Yue Lan Zhi\u2019s presence, was usually deserted. The new palace servants had been long warned to not go everywhere. They could only appear in the fixed range.</p><br/><p>After pulling the seal off the door, Wanyan Lie entered the chamber.</p><br/><p>It had been some time since Yue Lan Zhi had died. This chamber still had the original furnishing. Thinking about that woman, Wanyan Lie already had no impression of her. There were too many of that kind of woman around. There also had been too many similar women who\u2019d lived in this place\u2026</p><br/><p>Letting Jing De keep a look out above, Wanyan Lie went underground.</p><br/><p>He came to the heating warm jade bed. Wanyan Lie looked infatuatedly at the sleeping Wanyan Ming Yue. Before, having a woman to be the cover, he could come frequently to this Long Autumn palace. Recently, many things had happened. It was the first time he came here in a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue er,6 I have come.\u201d Holding Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hand, Wanyan Lie sat at her side. \u201cDid you miss me? These days, I keep dreaming about you. You\u2019d certainly missed me; that was why you came in my dreams, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Ming Yue on the warm jade bed only had a serene expression on her face. It seemed that she was listening to Wanyan Lie talking. It also seemed that she didn\u2019t hear anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to tell you good news! Your daughter has been found! Her name is Feng Qi Qi. Do you think this name is pleasing to the ears? She looks almost exactly like you. It was just, that pair of eyes was very much like Feng Xie\u2019s. The moment I saw Qi Qi, my heart almost stopped. She was simply a replica of you before you had married!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Wanyan Lie was talking, his chin shook slightly. Even those thin beards shook as if he was suppressing his excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who she is? She was Murong Qi Qi who\u2019d come for a marriage alliance. That bitch Li Qiu Shui took Qi Qi away and raised her as her daughter. She\u2019d calculated very well! She wanted to humiliate Cang er and Qi Qi. How would she know that after I knew that truth, I was eager for them to be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, I didn\u2019t grasp my happiness. In the end, I could only watch you become Feng Xie\u2019s bride. This became the forever pain in my heart. Now, such a pain was also torturing these two children. I don\u2019t want our tragedy to play once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Recalling the memories of the past, Wanyan Lie\u2019s expression turned painful as if every time he thought about the person he\u2019d missed and the things he\u2019d missed, he would regret and wished time could go back and that everything could be started over.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this palace, consort De\u2019s eyes are like yours. The empress\u2019s smile is like yours. Noble Lady Zhao\u2019s hair is black like yours. Lady of Handsome Fairness Zhou likes to eat sweet and sour plum, just like you. The frowning expression of Talented Lady Sun is exactly like yours\u2026On each of them, there\u2019s your shadow. You live through them and have been in my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve raised so many women in Long Autumn palace. I wanted to let them replace you and let me forget you. However, I\u2019ve discovered that I was wrong. I was outrageously wrong. When Qi Qi stood very alive in front of me, my heart felt like it had met spring and resuscitated. She is so much like you, ah! Every smile, every frown is very much like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing the tangling love of her and Cang er, it was like I had seen you and me. It was just, these two children are stronger than us! They obviously know they are siblings, but they continue to love. They\u2019re a lot braver than I!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, Cang er didn\u2019t come to the morning court. The person who went to the wangfu said that Cang er and Qi Qi didn\u2019t return. What do you think they went to do? Yue er, if, I mean if, if they truly love each other, would you support them? I think, I would certainly support them! I don\u2019t want my tragedy to repeat with the children. They didn\u2019t do anything wrong like how there was no wrong with me loving you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Time went by slowly. Wanyan Lie held Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hand and rambled a lot. Before he left, he tidied Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s hair. Finally, he left a kiss on her forehead. Then, he returned to above.</p><br/><p>After he came out, Wanyan Lie discovered that it was already afternoon. Jing De shut the door and fixed the seal. The two talented ones left Long Autumn palace with one walking in the front and one in the back.</p><br/><p>When they left, a person in black appeared in Long Autumn palace. Just now, he\u2019d followed Wanyan Lie to here. Only after a long time, did Wanyan Lie come out with red eyes.</p><br/><p>What kind of mystery was hidden inside here? Feng Xie in black clothes touched the seal on the door. After thinking for a long time, he looked for a window without a buckle and went inside.</p><br/><p>This chamber\u2026</p><br/><p>After seeing the furnishings in the chamber, Feng Xie was shocked.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d even doubted that he\u2019d come to the wrong place. How could this be the palace? It obviously was Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s boudoir! He and Wanyan Ming Yue were childhood sweethearts. When Wanyan family didn\u2019t get the world yet, he had been to Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s boudoir at Wanyan residence. The furnishings there was exactly the same as here.</p><br/><p>Why was it like thus? Feng Xie quickly walked to the bed and looked at everything here. After circling once, Feng Xie was felt even more sure. Right! Everything here, including those white dresses in the closet seemed to be Wanyan Ming Yue\u2019s.</p><br/><p>What happened? Why was it like this? Could it be that Wanyan Ming Yue didn\u2019t die and had been living in this Long Autumn palace? Why would Wanyan Lie hide Wanyan Ming Yue? Why would he do that?</p><br/><p>Feng Xie seemed to have grabbed some clues, but these clues were so vague that he couldn\u2019t get them right. He carefully inspected the area once and didn\u2019t find any problems. However, just now, he saw Wanyan Lie enter and then exit from here. Could it be that he\u2019d only come to sit for a while?</p><br/><p>Not letting Feng Xie think anymore, he\u2019d heard the voice of a little palace maid outside. Feng Xie went to the window and saw that it was two little palace maids. One was in pink and one was in green.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister, where do you think consort Yue went to hide? It has been so long, why has she still not captured? Could it be that she grew wings and flew away?\u201d The palace maid in pink looked young, about thirteen to fourteen years.</p><br/><p>\u201cHush! Lower your voice. Aren\u2019t you afraid that someone would hear?!\u201d The palace maid in green did a gesture of silence. Obviously, they\u2019d sneaked from the busy affairs and got a little freedom to chat.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one would hear! His majesty and eunuch Jing De have just left. Now, no one would come here. Big sister, I heard consort Yue was very beautiful. She got the emperor\u2019s favor very much and was the most favored one out of the six palaces. Why would she cut off her future and attempt to assassinate the emperor?\u201d</p><br/><p>While mentioning Yue Lan Zhi, the palace maid in pink\u2019s expression turned mysterious. Right now, the matter of Yue Lan Zhi was a popular topic. The whole capital had been turned over, but they didn\u2019t find Yue Lan Zhi. This person seemed to have disappeared into thin air and become a mystery.</p><br/><p>\u201cI tell you, what you hear in this palace is false. What you see with the eyes is also false. Many imperial noble consorts have died in this Long Autumn palace. Many servants have also died here. It\u2019s said that this Long Autumn palace is haunted! From time to time, you can hear the crying voice of a female ghost\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Jianghu: world of martial arts </p><br/><p>2. Wangye: prince of first rank</p><br/><p>3.

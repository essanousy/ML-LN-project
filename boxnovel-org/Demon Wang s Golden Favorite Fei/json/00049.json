Qing Qing has more capabilities than any of them! What does Qing Qing want to compete in? They don\u2019t believe in you; I believe in you. I bet a hundred thousand golden taels that Qing Qing will win!\u201d</p><br/><p>One hundred thousand golden taels! The people around couldn\u2019t help but exclaim! They heard that the Gold thread dress on Murong Qi Qi is worth ten thousand golden teals. This Nan Lin wang1 is really too generous!</p><br/><p>Now everyone is looking at Murong Qi Qi from the top to the bottom. They wanted to see some clues on her body. No matter how they look, she\u2019s just an ordinary beauty; pure and cute. She doesn\u2019t have the fox beauty. How was she able to make Nan Lin wang become crazy about her? Not only did he come forward for her, but also gave her backing? Really don\u2019t understand, ah\u2026 \u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, talking about money will hurt feelings. It\u2019s a bit vulgar, how can this be worthy of wangye\u2019s status!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as everybody was sighing, Murong Qi Qi spoke softly: \u201cBesides, you protecting me like this, I\u2019m afraid that you have scarred the two big sisters. How would they dare to show off in front of you? This seems a bit unfair to the two princesses\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfair? Feng Cang smiled. It seems that little wangfei2 has found some fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, what do you want then?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little person in his embrace had a faint fragrance on her body, making him a bit obsessed with it. Forget it, let her play. Anyway, if something goes wrong, he\u2019ll clean-up for her\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust take it as a girls\u2019 game. It has nothing to do with others!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stood up and went to the middle of the hall. She looked at Longze Yu Er and Ming Yue Xin smilingly. Her face is as smooth as jade. There simply isn\u2019t a trace of those tears anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust us three playing for a moment, how does that sound? Don\u2019t take out the identity of a princess and also don\u2019t put emperor or wangye out to scare others. We bet between us, how about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Longze Yu Er stand being provoked by a rubbish? She immediately stood out and walked to Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, bengong3 takes this bet!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the other side, Ming Yue Xin also came over. She was not afraid! Besides, she needs to get that position of Nan Lin wangfei!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, what do we bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we bet what we have? For example, bengong\u2019s crown, bengong\u2019s position of wangfei or\u2026 \u2026 \u2026your lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lethality of the last phrase \u2018your lives\u2019 coming out of Murong Qi Qi soft voice was diminished a lot. In Longze Yu Er\u2019s and Ming Yue Xin\u2019s ears, it sounded like a joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cBetting lives? What a big tone! Can you afford to bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mockery on Ming Yue Xin\u2019s face was very evident. A rubbish daring to just bluster things out. What kind of ability does she has? Besides, just now, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t let Feng Cang help. Putting aside her backing, she\u2019s just a useless thing\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin\u2019s words let Longze Yu Er pinch a sweat. But after seeing that Feng Cang\u2019s just sitting there, without any intention of helping Murong Qi Qi, Longze Yu Er put her heart at ease. It seemed that Feng Cang really doesn\u2019t plan on reaching out a helping hand. That\u2019s why her courage also gradually became bigger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, ah. Can you afford to bet it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the matter was developing according to her expectations, Murong Qi Qi smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the two big sisters aren\u2019t at ease, we can write down an agreement! Today, there are representatives of all three countries, we can ask them to be the judge, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSetting an agreement of the bet? This is not bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er was very happy. Just now, she had been worried that Murong Qi Qi would put Feng Can out to protect her. She (LYE) didn\u2019t expect that she (MQQ) would make such a request. Didn\u2019t this fit her(LYE) own purpose?</p><br/><p>Anyway, if Murong Qi Qi loses, even if they want her life, Feng Cang will not violate the bet agreement. After all, offending two countries because of a woman is not a worthwhile thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, since it\u2019s like this, why don\u2019t we invite Nan Lin wang, Nan Feng\u2019s crown prince and Jing wang to be the judges!\u201d</p><br/><p>High on the platform, Murong Xue Lian\u2019s jade hand moved back and forth on the back of Longze Yu\u2019s hand. No matter what, today\u2019s matter has nothing to do with her. No matter what the outcome is, she will be happy. So this imperial noble consort would gladly push the boat with the current.</p><br/><p>Push the boat with the current: take advantage of the situation for one\u2019s own benefit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu nodded. At least, if something happened like this, Feng Cang couldn\u2019t hold anyone accountable for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just what do you want to bet on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, why don\u2019t you come up with the subject?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi threw this question to Longze Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu narrowed his eyes in deep thoughts.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s performance just now made Longze Yu very dissatisfied. She\u2019s just a bestowed princess; does she really think she\u2019s something?! She didn\u2019t even marry and already forgot that she\u2019s Xi Qi\u2019s citizen. She almost stabbed him in the back and also ignored him when he sent her signals with his eyes. He must let her suffer to make her know how much she weighs!</p><br/><p>Weighs here means what kind of position/importance she has.</p><br/><p>Longze Yu looked at Ming Yue Xin and Longze Yu Er. Ming Yue Xin is famous for her paintings in Nan Feng. Although his daughter is somewhat mischievous, but she wouldn\u2019t lose to Murong Qi Qi in this. Thinking till here, Longze Yu cleared his throat: \u201cThis year, the chrysanthemums in the imperial garden has just opened. Why don\u2019t you compete on painting! The subject is chrysanthemum, along with a poem!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin was the first one to agree. In this respect, she\u2019s an expert. She didn\u2019t believe that Murong Qi Qi could win over her. Ming Yue Xin looked provocatively at Murong Qi Qi once as if she was saying \u2018you\u2019re dead!\u2019.</p><br/><p>Towards Ming Yue Xin\u2019s provocative eyes, Murong Qi Qi only laughed: \u201cSince we already have the subject, we can now talk about the bet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want the position of Nan Lin wangfei!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to finish, Longze Yu Er rushed to say it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lose the position of Nan Lin wangfei is bengong\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her daughter\u2019s words, empress Duanmu Qing was shocked. She never expected that Longze Yu Er\u2019s heart would move for Feng Cang. Although that man is very beautiful, but he isn\u2019t a good person, ah!</p><br/><p>Even Longze Yu frowned. Before, the one who cried and refused to be Nan Lin wangfei was her. Now, the one who is fighting to be it is also her. This daughter, ah. In the end, she had been spoiled by him\u2026\u2026Longze Yu helplessly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi looked at Ming Yue Xin.</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong wants your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin revealed a ruthless smile. She won\u2019t be as mindless as Longze Yu Er. If there\u2019s a possibility that Feng Cang really has an interest for Murong Qi Qi, and would not letting her become Nan Lin wangfei, then he can let her become cefei4. That\u2019s why she wants her life! As long as Murong Qi Qi is dead, with her talent, beauty and her noble identity, Ming Yue Xin didn\u2019t believe that Feng Cang wouldn\u2019t be tempted!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026 \u2026if you win, I will surely let your wishes come true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi smiled like a dream and a fantasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for bengong, usually what bengong likes the most is collecting beautiful things. The two princesses\u2019 hands are very beautiful. If you lose, troubling you to leave your pair of hands here\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leave a pair of hands? The moment Longze Yu Er thought about the image of her hands being chopped off, she couldn\u2019t help but shudder. She wanted to back off, but when she met Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes, she could see the sarcasm at the bottom of her eyes. Longze Yu Er gritted her teeth and took the bet.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! No problem! Now we only have to see if you have the ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBengong also doesn\u2019t have a problem with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Xin was full of confidence. Confronting Murong Qi Qi, she only needs a small finger. She has nothing to worry about.</p><br/><p>Wang/ wangye: prince of the first rank \u21a9</p><br/><p>Wangfei: wife of a wangye \u21a9</p><br/><p>Bengong: I, used by a female of the imperial family \u21a9</p><br/><p>Cefei/ ce wangfei: second ranked wife of a wangye</p><br/>\n</div>"}

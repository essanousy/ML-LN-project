After hearing Yu Shi Shi\u2019s words, Murong Qi Qi made a judgement of her. She pushed away all responsibility. With one sentence \u2018did not see clearly\u2019, she got rid of all relation. Now, she pushed her (MQQ) out. Does she (YSS) think that she (MQQ) really is a pushover who everyone can bully?</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, don\u2019t be afraid. Say what you saw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small hand and seemed to cheer for her. In fact, it\u2019s also telling everyone that he\u2019s standing on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>With Feng Cang\u2019s support, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s confidence was enough. She pretended to recall what had happened. Her expression paled. Her voice began to tremble. Her voice pointed at palace maid Ning er1 who was standing at Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWorms\u2026\u2026many worms\u2026\u2026Then I fell. Fifth royal highness saved me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such short sentences made people unable to guess the content. The people who heard it became even more puzzled. They didn\u2019t know what kind of meaning this princess Zhao Yang wanted to express. It\u2019s the eloquent Wanyan Kang who then translated Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father, it\u2019s this palace maid who poured the worms on princess Zhao Yang. Princess Zhao Yang was afraid. As she was taking a step back, she slipped and fell. As for how miss Mu pushed little sister into the lake and how she was then pulled into the lake by little sister, this subject son doesn\u2019t know a thing about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Black, really a black belly! Hearing Wanyan Kang\u2019s words, Murong Qi Qi almost vomited blood. You already said that it\u2019s Mu Yu Die who pushed Wanyan Bao Zhu into the water and then she herself was pulled into the water by Wanyan Bao Zhu, in the end you still say you don\u2019t know anything? This fifth prince was a black belly to the extreme.</p><br/><p>Having this testimony of Wanyan Kang, the truth about the \u2018falling into water\u2019 incident came out. Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die also didn\u2019t have anything to say. They glared once at each other, full of hate.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that nothing happened. It\u2019s good that everyone is safe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Empress Li Bing smoothed things over. As long as this incident had nothing to do with crown princess Yu Shi Shi, then she was relieved. The empress wanted to let this incident pass, but someone was not willing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, this poor child. You must be certainly frightened!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expression, and her mouth showed much heartache: \u201cEmpress, it\u2019s chenqie\u2019s2 fault. Chenqie\u2019s body is weak. Just took two breezes and my head felt a powerful headache. I had to let crown princess take care of them. Didn\u2019t expect that such a thing would happen\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One sentence let all the responsibility fall onto Yu Shi Shi again. This crown princess Yu Shi Shi was the empress\u2019s daughter-in-law. How could consort De let her be well?</p><br/><p>After listening to Lin Ke Xin\u2019s words, Wanyan Lie nodded: \u201cCrown princess, you are also responsible for this incident. When you go back, shut yourself up and ponder over your mistake for one month! As for palace maid Ning er, she knows the rules and still offended her superior. Drag her out and beat her to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaughter-in-law accepts the decree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi\u2019s face was pale. Her body shook a bit. Obviously, this incident didn\u2019t have anything to do with her. Why was it that it had turned around in a circle, that the one who would receive punishment was her?!</p><br/><p>As for Ning er, she had it even more bitter. She knelt and kowtowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, have mercy! Emperor, have mercy! This slave knows this slave\u2019s wrongdoing. Emperor, have mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that emperor father wanted to sentence Ning er to death, Wanyan Bao Zhu also got anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor father, Ning er didn\u2019t do it on purpose! This is not Ning er\u2019s fault. It\u2019s this subject daughter who let her go get the fish food! Emperor, have mercy! Ning er served this subject daughter since little. This subject daughter is already accustomed with using her. Emperor father, don\u2019t kill Ning er! Asking emperor father to please have mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>One word of the son of heaven is worth nine sacred tripods. Once those words came out, naturally they cannot be recovered. So Wanyan Lie didn\u2019t soften at his daughter\u2019s tears. It just so happened that empress and Consort De helped with Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s plea, making Wanyan Lie\u2019s frown loosen up a bit.</p><br/><p>One word of the son of heaven is worth nine sacred tripods: one word of the emperor has enormous weight. It means that the emperor cannot easily go back on his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor, since this incident has something to do with princess Zhao Yang, why don\u2019t we listen to her opinion?!\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, she\u2019s a person who shares a bed with Wanyan Lie. Only a subtle movement from him, and Lin Ke Xin can figure his mind out clearly. After seeing that Wanyan Lie wanted to let Ning er off the hook, but because he had opened his golden mouth and couldn\u2019t go back on his words, Lin Ke Xin found a way out for Wanyan Lie.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, this ball was kicked back to Murong Qi Qi. The moment Wanyan Bao Zhu saw that things could turn out for the better, she quickly let Ning er go beg Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Although Ning er was full of tears, but Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t see the slightest remorse in her eyes. Even Wanyan Bao Zhu let out a breath, thinking that she wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything to Ning er.</p><br/><p>Ai, this master and servant, ah. They really misjudged her!</p><br/><p>\u201cAt home, there are rules of the home. On a country, there are laws of the country. Qi Qi doesn\u2019t dare to be presumptuous and change the decision of the son of heaven!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi glanced once \u2018full of fear\u2019 at the emperor. With a soft voice, she kicked the ball back to him and tightly closed Ning er\u2019s way to survival. Since Murong Qi Qi said it like that, Wanyan Lie couldn\u2019t go back. One order, Ning er\u2019s mouth became blocked and she was dragged out. Outside, she was directly beaten to death.</p><br/><p>A welcoming banquet ended with the death of a palace maid. Outside the palace gate, Murong Qi Qi took a deep breath. The palace and her really don\u2019t mesh well. Why was it that every time she went into the palace, there would always be people dying?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi taking a breath had been seen by Wanyan Kang. He couldn\u2019t help but open his mouth to tease her: \u201cCousin-in-law, in the future you need to be careful, ah! Today, Ning er died. Bao Zhu will certainly put this thing on your head. That girl bear grudges very strongly. You need to be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, it\u2019s good advice, but coming out from Wanyan Kang\u2019s mouth, it had the taste of him wanting to watch a \u2018play\u2019.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi pretended to not understand the meaning of Wanyan Kang\u2019s words. She looked at Wanyan Kang confusedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoyal highness, why would princess blame me? Was it not the emperor who sentenced her to death? This is Ning er\u2019s blessing, ah! Wangye3 don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>It so happened that Feng Cang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s her blessing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlessing?\u201d</p><br/><p>This word choked Wanyan Kang half to death. Was this princess Zhao really na\u00efve or was she pretending to be na\u00efve, ah? Why was cousin brother also following her in playing the fool, ah? Not waiting for Wanyan Kang to understand, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s carriage slowly drifted away.</p><br/><p>Inside the carriage, Murong Qi Qi was leaning against Feng Cang\u2019s chest. She closed her eyes slightly. In her mind, she was thinking about Yu Shi Shi and Feng Cang\u2019s relationship. Although, today she had met many infatuated flowers, but in her heart, Murong Qi Qi felt that this infatuated flower was somewhat different. She didn\u2019t know how it was different. However, the hatred emitting from her (YSS) towards her (MQQ) was a lot stronger compared to the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrightened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s big hand was on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s black hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi shook her head. She wasn\u2019t afraid of those worms. There were many things more frightening than worms, such as people\u2019s hearts\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have anything you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi remained silent and was not the same as usual, Feng Cang couldn\u2019t help but inquire into this little wangfei\u2019s4 heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, there\u2019s something that I don\u2019t know if I should say it or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it. What is it that let my Qing Qing be sulky?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only when Feng Cang said that did Murong Qi Qi become aware that ever since she had stepped inside the carriage, she had been unhappy. Could it be because of Yu Shi Shi and Feng Cang\u2019s relationship?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, the way crown princess looks at me is very strange. It\u2019s as if she is looking at a love rival. You say, what does she mean, ah? Is she eyeing what\u2019s in the pot as she eats from her bowl? Is she standing next to crown prince and still misses you, ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eyeing what\u2019s in the pot as she eats from her bowl: not content with what one already has/ wandering eye.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi twisted her hair in her fingers and bit her lips. A pair of watery eyes looked at Feng Cang, making him almost lose his soul. So, it\u2019s because of Yu Shi Shi? His little wangfei saying that, could it be that she\u2019s a bit jealous? Feng Cang felt somewhat happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe and I once had a marriage agreement. Half a month before the marriage, she suddenly cancelled the agreement and married Wanyan Hong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang concisely summed up in a few words what his relationship with Yu Shi Shi was.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Feng Cang\u2019s \u2018explanation\u2019, Murong Qi Qi stretched her voice and didn\u2019t ask any further.</p><br/><p>The silence made Feng Cang feel uncomfortable. He gentle patted Murong Qi Qi\u2019s nose twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of relationship did Qing Qing think we have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, it should be childhood sweethearts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi vaguely remembered that the other girls mentioned childhood sweethearts. Those girls certainly said it on purpose for her to hear. So, she still remembered.</p><br/><p>\u201cChildhood sweethearts?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Feng Cang heard such words. So, the others thought that he and Yu Shi Shi\u2019s relationship was that of childhood sweethearts? What a joke! It\u2019s just that when they were young, their parents knew each other and also had some connections with each other. They saw each other a few times only. How come they had become childhood sweethearts to everyone? No wonder every time crown prince looked at him, his demeanor was not right. Could it be because of this?</p><br/><p>Listening to the tone in Feng Cang\u2019s voice, Murong Qi Qi became completely rest assured.</p><br/><p>If a man uses a cold, ruthless and with some disdain type of voice to mention a woman, then that woman certainly doesn\u2019t have any place in his heart. Besides, Feng Cang\u2019s voice also had a trace of disgust as if, if he goes to touch that person, he would get dirty. Could it be that this was the so-called obsession with cleanliness?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, you are so ruthless, those ladies\u2019 hearts will certainly be broken!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mood was very good. This also let Feng Cang\u2019s face become full of laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing is now at ease?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her state of mind being pointed out by Feng Cang made Murong Qi Qi immediately feel embarrassed. Her small face turned pinkish. She glanced at Feng Cang. Seeing the smile in his eyes, Murong Qi Qi felt even more embarrassed. She hid her face to not let Feng Cang laugh at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi hide her head like an ostrich, Feng Cang couldn\u2019t love her enough. He reached out and took her into his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fool, don\u2019t restrain yourself too much! Come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi stubbornly shook her head. What a shame! All those thoughts had been seen through by Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out, alright?! I promise not to laugh at you. Really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang coaxed Murong Qi Qi with a soft voice and gentle words. It\u2019s just that she refused. Only when they had arrived at the entrance of wangfu5, did Murong Qi Qi raise her red head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang, there\u2019s one thing I want to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face was still pink, but her eyes were clear and thorough. Her voice was also very serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have love phobia. I have no way of accepting polygamy. Besides, I also have no way of accepting my husband having other women. My man, no matter if it\u2019s his body or heart, must be completely belong to me. Being touched by others, no matter if it\u2019s unintentional or intentional, I will feel dirty. Rather than living in torture together, it\u2019s better to leave alone, free and easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi said that very seriously. Feng Cang also listened very seriously. He didn\u2019t expect that his little wangfei\u2019s personality is so resolute! This is quite to his taste. Their thoughts coincide and are the same!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I assure you, my whole body from head to toe is very clean without any impurities. Aside from the time when I was young and my mother bathed me, there are no other women who has seen my body, let alone touch it. I absolutely meet your requirements. Moreover, with Qing Qing in it, my heart has no room for other people. Not to mention being intimate with others. Even if you don\u2019t feel dirty, I will think it\u2019s dirty!\u201d</p><br/><p>After some silence, Feng Cang added two sentences: \u201cToday, I gave my first kiss to you. Qing Qing must take responsibility!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t react for a long time to the \u2018first kiss\u2019 Feng Cang mentioned. When she remembered the kiss Feng Cang placed on her forehead at the banquet, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s face burned badly.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, will you take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang moved closer to Murong Qi Qi and shot a flirtatious glance at her. Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body immediately shivered. This man, whether he\u2019s being cold and ruthless or acting spoiled like this, he was still the most outrageous out of all the outrageous.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing won\u2019t take responsibility towards me; I can\u2019t continue live anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t answer for half a day, Feng Cang clutched his face and pretended to cry. This time, Murong Qi Qi was out of words. How could he cry whenever he wants? She has never met such a man as Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I will be responsible for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sobbing for a long time and finally heard this sentence, Feng Cang immediately smiled and took Murong Qi Qi into his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, why don\u2019t we pledge our love with a kiss?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to react, Feng Cang\u2019s lips was already on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Ice cold, this was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s first feeling. Why was it so cold? Even though now it\u2019s winter, Feng Cang\u2019s body temperature was not like ordinary people. Wasn\u2019t senior brother already performing treatment for Feng Cang? Why was it that after so many years, he still didn\u2019t get any better? What kind of problem does Feng Cang\u2019s body exactly have?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s thoughts already flew to the highest cloud. How would she remember that now it\u2019s their first kiss and she needed to be serious about it?!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, you didn\u2019t concentrate!\u201d</p><br/><p>After realizing that this little person\u2019s mind was elsewhere, Feng Cang\u2019s eyes showed that he was injured.</p><br/><p>Only when the cold disappeared from her lips and at her ears sounded the resentful voice of Feng Cang, did Murong Qi Qi became aware that her behavior was too much and would hurt a man\u2019s \u2018self-esteem\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I, I, it wasn\u2019t on purpose\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can Qing Qing\u2019s heart not have another?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang raised Murong Qi Qi\u2019s chin and looked at her in the eyes. The result of his first kiss really let Feng Cang feel surprised. His little wangfei\u2019s mind actually wandered off, making him unable to not want to know Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi shook her head quickly to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only felt that wangye\u2019s temperature is different from ordinary people. Don\u2019t know what kind of medicine wangye is usually taking? Why is your body so cold?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s questions were very subtle, but it made Feng Cang surprised for a moment.</p><br/><p>So, it was like that! She was worried about him. He actually misunderstood her! He didn\u2019t expect that she was so careful and so considerate. With just a small detail, she was able to think of so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just some old diseases. I\u2019m already working with the treatment of Jin Mo! I believe that after a while, he will be able to find a cure for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang only said two sentences about the problems on his body. He didn\u2019t want to scare Murong Qi Qi and didn\u2019t want her to be too worried. Especially about gu poison, he didn\u2019t want Murong Qi Qi to know. He didn\u2019t even more want Murong Qi Qi to see his appearance when the disease was acting up. This matter, if he could hide it, he would hide it!</p><br/><p>Feng Cang said it with so much certainty that Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t think about it anymore. Murong Qi Qi believed in Jin Mo\u2019s skills. In the past, master said that although Jin Mo was somewhat heartless and long-winded, but his skills were excellent. With this senior brother here, Feng Cang would certainly be alright.</p><br/><p>At this side, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s feelings advanced one more step. At the other side, Yu Shi Shi was receiving inhuman torture.</p><br/><p>The crown prince\u2019s carriage had entered the East Palace. It stopped at the entrance of the study, but for a long time, no one had come down. Towards such happenings, the servants at the East Palace were already used to. They continued what they were doing. No one was concerned about why the crown prince and the crown princess still hadn\u2019t come out of the carriage.</p><br/><p>The East Palace is the place where every prince lives when they become crown prince until the moment they become the emperor.</p><br/><p>TL Note: Click here for the last part of chapter 72 and the first part of chapter 73.

The moment you cry, old master\u2019s, my heart really hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld master is prejudiced! See how Xin er\u2019s 2face is hurt! The double seven festival is just around the corner. What will you let Xin er do?! Not long ago, Anyang wangfei 3 praised our Xin er, saying that she is intelligent. Now looking like this, how will Xin er go see people at the double seven festival? Old master, if this time you do not punish Qing er, this concubine will be unhappy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Double seven festival is the Chinese valentine which fell on the 7th of July of the lunar calendar</p><br/><p>Zheng Min saw that Murong Tai came to her first, naturally she was happy.</p><br/><p>Although Murong Qing Lian was a talent at martial arts, but women, after all, have to marry. Men wouldn\u2019t like such a strong woman. Since ancient times it was always the hero who saves the beauty. Never had it been the beauty who saves the hero. What kind of joke was that?!</p><br/><p>Zheng Min had full confidence in her daughter. Since Murong Xue Lian became Imperial Noble Consort, her daughter Murong Xin Lian\u2019s looks were also not bad. Not to mention that the main wife Li Qiu Shui is now staying at a temple to pray and didn\u2019t ask for the details about the outside world. Naturally, there was no one to stop her daughter\u2019s road to the wealth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t cry anymore. First, cure Xin er\u2019s face, then we will talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai took out a small box of creams.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Lian gongzi\u2019s 4Jade Lotus cream. I took it back from Xue Lian. First, let Xin Lian use it! Don\u2019t leave scars, otherwise there\u2019ll be trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she heard strange doctor Lian gongzi\u2019s Jade Lotus cream, Zheng Min quickly took it. She opened the box and a pleasant aroma came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really a good thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is, Xue Lian only got a total of two boxes. Now this box is Xin Lian\u2019s. Let her make her face look good again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai patiently coaxed Zheng Min for a while. Before he went away, he touched her face and then hastily rushed to Lan Xiang yuan, where Liu Yan Zhi lived.</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Tai\u2019s plump body disappear, Zheng Min humphed coldly. She took the Jade Lotus cream and applied it evenly on Murong Xin Lian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, father still cares more about fourth little sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian lowered her head. The long eyelashes blocked the emotions in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, remember, no matter how much grievances you suffer, be sure to endure. You are smarter than Qing Lian and also more beautiful than her. In the future, you will marry better than her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a son, Zheng Min could only rely on Murong Xin Lian. So, seeing Murong Xin Lian suffer grievances, her heart was also in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I want to be Jing wangfei! I want to marry Longze Jing Tian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zheng Min mention marriage, Murong Xin Lian suddenly raised her head. Her watery eyes sparkled with a strange light.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that that rubbish Murong Qi Qi who\u2019s good at nothing can directly marry Jing wang 5 and become wangfei?! I\u2019m not reconciled, mother, I\u2019m really not reconciled. Her status is just nobler than mine, but what capabilities does she have?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s hands clenched into fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, today Qing Lian sarcastically told me that I\u2019m from a concubine and in the future, I can only be a concubine. Mother, don\u2019t you know that at that moment I really wanted to kill her! I really hate ah\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Listening to Murong Xin Lian, Zheng Min\u2019s eyes filled with tears. Without a son, in this household her spine was a lot softer than Liu Yan Zhi. Normally, Li Yan Zhi mocked and ridiculed her and spoke words with thorns. All of that she could forget. Now even Murong Qing Lian was humiliating her darling daughter, making Zheng Min grit her teeth from hate.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin er, mother won\u2019t let you suffer grievances anymore. Don\u2019t you want to marry Longze Jing Tian and want to be Jing wangfei? I have a way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhen Min\u2019s word made Murong Xin Lian\u2019s mood immediately turn good. She grabbed Zheng Min\u2019s hand and began to shake it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, is what you said true? But their marriage has been bestowed by the emperor. What good way do you have to let Jing wang marry me? Daughter absolutely cannot be the small one. Being bullied by that rubbish Murong Qi Qi, I might as well die. Mother, if I can marry Longze Jing Tian and become wangfei, even in my dreams I will wake up laughing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Xin Lian like this, Zheng Min knew her daughter had really put Longze Jing Tian in her heart.</p><br/><p>That wangye was good at martial arts, handsome and besides he might become the crown prince. In the future, he might even become the emperor. Then won\u2019t Murong Xin Lian be the mother of the world, the empress\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Thinking about Murong Xin Lian\u2019s beautiful future, Zheng Min gritted her teeth and her heart gave birth to a deadly trap. Murong Qi Qi, since you are blocking my daughter\u2019s road to wealth, then don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!</p><br/><p>Zheng Min whispered a few words in Murong Xin Lian\u2019s ear. Hearing her mother\u2019s words, Murong Xin Lian muzzled a cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, is this alright? Will destroying Murong Qi Qi\u2019s reputation let Jing wangbreak off the engagement? But where would we find a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMan, isn\u2019t there one here?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Min\u2019s gentle face flashed a hint of viciousness.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it because Liu Yan Zhi had given birth to the only son of Murong household that she had been so loved by Murong Tai?! She\u2019d also relied on the fact that she had a son to fall back on and acted as if she was superior. Normally, she gave Zheng Min much anger!</p><br/><p>If Liu Yan Zhi\u2019s darling son Murong Jun appeared on third miss Murong Qi Qi\u2019s bed, this brother and sister affair, then not only would Murong Qi Qi be ruined but also Murong Jun will be ruined! She\u2019d like to see if by that time Liu Yan Zhi could still laugh!</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, this plan is really good. One stone killing two birds! That Murong Jun is always looking in secret at daughter, really disgusting. If we can get rid of both of them, then it couldn\u2019t be better!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian knew what Zheng Min was thinking, she immediately said good.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi, you can go to hell! You actually dare to steal my man. I\u2019ll let you know my power! That year, the fact that you didn\u2019t die was because you were lucky. This time, I want you to feel that living is more painful than death! Take your noble status and go to hell!</p><br/><p>That pair of eyes of Murong Xin Lian which looked similar to that of Zheng Min, at this moment, along with her mother, were flashing vicious lights. The two of them were like two poisonous snakes. Their mouths revealed cruel smiles\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>At Lan Xiang yuan, Murong Tai didn\u2019t take long before he appeased this pair of mother and daughter.</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian\u2019s martial arts was higher than Murong Xin Lian\u2019s, which was why she wasn\u2019t as wounded as Murong Xin Lian. She\u2019d just received superficial wounds. Murong Tai promised to give her a treasure sword. So, he recovered his youngest daughter\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>As for Liu Yan Zhi, the best way to appease her was in bed. Murong Tai always believed in fighting at the front of the bed, making up at the end of the bed. So he didn\u2019t say anything more and directly pulled Liu Yan Zhi for a few rounds. When the beauty was lying breathless in his arms, Murong Tai knew that today\u2019s matter had passed like this.</p><br/><p>The next few days, the prime minister\u2019s mansion was very quiet. Murong Qi Qi was \u2018honestly\u2019 staying in Cui Zhu yuan to \u2018reflect\u2019. Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian also didn\u2019t go out. They quietly hid in their yuans to recuperate.</p><br/><p>Ten days later, Murong Xin Lian\u2019s Fei Cui appeared at Cui Zhu yuan. She invited Murong Qi Qi to go admire the full moon at Hu Xin pavilion tonight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdmire the moon? Don\u2019t want to go! I\u2019m still shutting myself up to reflect over my mistakes!\u201d</p><br/><p>With just moving a toe, you\u2019d know that, that woman had bad intentions. Recently, Murong Qi Qi was really busy. She had no time to accompany that little miss at playing schemes, so she directly rejected Fei Cui.</p><br/><p>1. Yuan: part fo a residence</p><br/><p>2. Er: term of endearment</p><br/><p>3.

They also didn\u2019t want to bother with it. The priority now was how to cure the Forget Love in Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cJia Lan, is there a cure for Forget Love?\u201d Feng Qi Qi was a bit anxious. If Forget Love was really the same as what Jia Lan had said; that after three years of falling in love, he would forget the person he loves completely. Then, didn\u2019t she and Feng Cang only have two and a half years left?</p><br/><p>\u201cIncurable,\u201d Jia Lan shook his head. \u201cThis was a poison originally designed to prevent the female disciples of Penglai from betraying Penglai Island. There\u2019s no cure for Forget Love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t believe that in this world, there was a poison without a cure. He didn\u2019t want to forget Feng Qi Qi. He didn\u2019t want to forget everything about her!</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk! What is the cure?\u201d Feng Cang grabbed Jia Lan. His eyes were cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know! Even if you kill me, I still don\u2019t know! Unless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless what?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless you go to Penglai Island and find my master. Perhaps then, you can cure it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2019 Feng Cang threw Jia Lan on the ground. His face was gloomy. \u201cI will! I will go to Penglai Island within two years and find the cure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lan and Jin Yu were \u2018escorted\u2019 back to Nan Lin wangfu.1 Feng Cang decided to arrest these two to have them lead the way to Penglai Island later on.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t forget you!\u201d Inside Tingsong building, Feng Cang held Feng Qi Qi and kissed her frowning brow. \u201cBelieve me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026,\u201d Feng Qi Qi felt very weak. The moment she thought that in the near future, Feng Cang would forget every thing about them, forget their child, it made her heart feel so cold that it would frighten others.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me handle this matter! I will certainly take down Dong Lu within six months. By then, we can go to Penglai Island together, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d Things have reached this stage, so this was the only way. They couldn\u2019t be sluggish about Dong Lu\u2019s war. The longer they delay, the less time they had for themselves. Besides, there were also Xi Qi and the Jurchen tribe. These things would affect them. The war must be ended quickly!</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Cheng had rushed back to Nan Feng after reaching an agreement with Feng Qi Qi. Before leaving, he left Feng Qi Qi a letter. On it were only two flamboyantly written words: \u2018Don\u2019t worry\u2019.</p><br/><p>When he left, he also took Gu Yun Wan with him. Ever since she knew Ming Yue Cheng was in love with Feng Qi Qi, Gu Yun Wan had been thinking about how to approach Feng Qi Qi and take a look at what kind of person she was. It was just, she hadn\u2019t found a chance yet, when she was taken back to Nan Feng by Ming Yue Cheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue Cheng, why do you have to help Bei Zhou? Is it because of Feng Qi Qi?\u201d Inside the carriage, Gu Yun Wan muttered and cast a glance at Ming Yue Cheng. Originally, she\u2019d thought that Ming Yue Cheng had come around. That he\u2019d wanted to go back to Nan Feng to become the emperor. She didn\u2019t expect that the reason he went back this time was to send the army to Xi Qi. \u201cIs Feng Qi Qi really that great?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with her! I just thought that this was an opportunity. Now is the right time to plot against Xi Qi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, right! Who are you kidding?!\u201d Gu Yun Wan didn\u2019t believe Ming Yue Cheng. \u201cEver since you\u2019ve returned from the wangfu, you changed your mind. It\u2019s definitely because of Feng Qi Qi! Ming Yue Cheng, I need to remind you. You\u2019re a country\u2019s emperor. You can\u2019t disregard the country\u2019s interests because of love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Qi Qi had once helped me. A friend is in trouble, so I should help. This is the first reason. Secondly, Xi Qi had once insulted Nan Feng, insulted me. I should take revenge for this hatred. Thirdly, if Bei Zhou is destroyed, it won\u2019t benefit Nan Feng in any way. You probably understand the principle of when the lips go cold, the teeth would die. Well! I don\u2019t want to explain anymore about this matter! This is settled!</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yue Cheng, you obviously are a bastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Er drove the carriage and listened to the shouts and screams inside. He smiled helplessly. He continued to hit the horse\u2019s butt.</p><br/><p>After keeping Feng Qi Qi company for the whole night, Feng Cang woke up very early the next morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang\u2026\u201d Today was the day to send the army away. Feng Qi Qi wanted to wake up and send Feng Cang off, but she was stopped by Feng Cang, \u201cYou should rest well. Sleep a little more! Don\u2019t send me off. The feeling of parting is uncomfortable. I don\u2019t want\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s fallacious reasoning made Feng Qi Qi nod in the end. She laid on the bed and looked at Feng Cang as he put on a silver silk armor and robe. That white color made Feng Cang appear extraordinarily handsome, making Feng Qi Qi be in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for my return! Also, I love you!\u201d Feng Cang deeply looked at Feng Qi Qi once. Finally, he kissed her forehead. He turned and left Tingsong building.</p><br/><p>Outside of Yan capital, the three armies went away at the same time. Little emperor Wanyan Jie and empress dowager Dongfang Lan personally went outside the palace to bid them farewell.</p><br/><p>\u201cSafety comes first! You must pay attention to safety!\u201d Looking at Feng Xie, Feng Cang and Wanyan Kang, Dongfang Lan had only this sentence to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>After bidding Dongfang Lan and Wanyan Jie farewell, the three mounted a horse. \u201cDepart!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of the trombone sounded through the earth. The three troops mightily moved to three different directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe sure to come back safely!\u201d Dongfang Lan waved. Her eyes had tears. If there was no war, how great would it be?! However, the wish was great, but the reality was always cruel. She wished that her descendants would come back safely. She wished that the world was peaceful and the country prospered and the people were at peace!</p><br/><p>The regent and Xiaoyao wang2 personally went to war. The affairs of the state once again fell onto Dongfang Lan. Fortunately, Dongfang Lan had been a successful career woman who passed like the thunder and moved like the wind. These matters were a piece of cake for her. Plus, because of the invasion of the foreign enemies, the whole court dealt with outsiders. So, the officials of the court were united like never before.</p><br/><p>Passed like the thunder and move like the wind: swift and decisive</p><br/><p>Feng Qi Qi rested for a whole day. After bidding Dongfang Lan and Wanyan Ming Yue farewell, she embarked on the journey to the east.</p><br/><p>The eagle troop searched for a long time at the Red River, but they still hadn\u2019t found Misha or Xia Xue. They hadn\u2019t even seen their corpses. When this news was passed onto Feng Cang, Feng Cang stopped the pursuit of Misha. These two people had either died or escaped.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s guess wasn\u2019t wrong. At the lower reaches of the Red River, in an ordinary house made from grass, Misha had been unconscious for a month.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Xia Xue, the medicine is boiled!\u201d An old woman came in while carrying a bowl of thick black medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma Li, thank you! I gave you trouble!\u201d Xia Xue quickly stood up, but was stopped by grandma Li. \u201cDon\u2019t move! The injuries on your body haven\u2019t healed yet!\u201d The grandma handed the bowl of medicine to Xia Xue. \u201cDon\u2019t only care to take care of your husband. You should also take care of yourself! Your medicine will be done in a moment! I will bring it to you soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Xia Xue wanted to send the elderly out but was once again stopped by grandma Li. \u201cRest well! If your body isn\u2019t well, how would you take care of your husband?! Speaking about it, this little young master is also very brave. He looks young but has the courage to elope with you. However, your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is too aggressive. They treated you like this. Really a pair of unfortunate mandarin ducks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mandarin ducks: affectionate couple</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma Li, I should thank you and uncle Li for saving us. If it wasn\u2019t because of you and uncle Li, I and my husband would\u2019ve certainly died. Even if we didn\u2019t die, we would\u2019ve been caught by them. It would be no different from death then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue\u2019s complexion was pale. Although her expression was a bit cold, but when facing the elder, it was a lot gentler, \u201cI thank you on behalf of my husband! I kowtow to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t care about the pain on her legs and body, Xia Xue came to the elder and knelt in front of her. \u2018Knock, knock, knock\u2019, she kowtowed three times.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyaya! Quickly stand up! What are you doing, ah?! Quickly stand up!\u201d Grandma Li helped Xia Xue stand up and also helped her sit down. \u201cWe have a tiny family and house and don\u2019t have many good things! It could be considered that you were lucky! Fortunately, my old man had opened a medicine shop in the past. Li Da had learnt some medical skills from his father. Otherwise, we couldn\u2019t have saved you. Like the old saying, heaven helps the worthy. You two hadn\u2019t died due to a calamity, so you would be able to enjoy blessings in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also hope so! If my husband can really wake up, then I\u2019m willing to do everything for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue said it very emotionally, making the elder\u2019s eyes got warm, \u201cSilly girl, what silly things are you saying?! When your husband wakes up, you should find a place to hide for three or five years. After a period of time, the anger in your parents would be eliminated. By then, you could go back with their grandchildren to apologize. Your parents will forgive you! Listening to this old woman is right!\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending grandma Li away, Xia Xue came with the medicine to Misha.</p><br/><p>Seeing Misha\u2019s left eye wrapped in gauze, Xia Xue\u2019s tears couldn\u2019t help but fall. It had been a month. Misha was still in a coma. Previously, he had a fever for a long time. She thought that he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it and also intended to die with him. She didn\u2019t think that Misha would survive, but after that, he fell into a long coma.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, young master\u2026,\u201d She gently stroked Misha\u2019s left shoulder. The wound there had begun to heal. As grandma Lee said, fortunately they\u2019d encountered Li Da who knew how to treat wounds. Otherwise, they would\u2019ve long become white bones.</p><br/><p>Although Misha\u2019s shoulder could be healed, but his left eye was completely destroyed. Feng Cang\u2019s arrow had hit Misha\u2019s left eye. Now, his left eye was completely destroyed and he had become someone with only one eye. She didn\u2019t know if Misha would accept this matter when he wakes up. Someone as proud as young master, it took him a long time to adopt to the fact that his legs were disabled. Now, he lost a left eye. He would be very, very sad!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, it\u2019s Xia Xue\u2019s fault. It\u2019s Xia Xue who didn\u2019t block the arrow. It\u2019s Xia Xue who didn\u2019t take good care of you!\u201d Xia Xue\u2019s face was pasted on Misha\u2019s chest. Her worry eased a bit after listening to his calm heartbeat. A heartbeat meant that young master was still alive! As long as he was alive, there would be hope in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, forget Yi Lian, alright?! Is Xia Xue not good? Why can\u2019t you look at me?! I won\u2019t leave you. I will never abandon you\u2026Young master, am I not good enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue talked endlessly about things she usually didn\u2019t dare to say. In the past, Misha didn\u2019t like her to touch him, but now, she\u2019s the one who is changing his medicine, wiping him and feeding him medicine. Once or twice, Xia Xue had hoped to continue in such a state. Even if Misha was unconscious, but at least, such a Misha belonged to her completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, drink the medicine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue took a mouthful of medicine, leaned over and put her lips on Misha\u2019s lips. Her small tongue pried his lips and teeth open and let the medicine go in Misha\u2019s mouth. She waited till he swallowed it before she continued to feed him the next mouthful.</p><br/><p>Such an intimate contact was something Xia Xue never dared to imagine! But now Misha was unconscious and couldn\u2019t swallow the medicine. She could only feed him with her mouth and was also happy to enjoy such intimacy.</p><br/><p>Xia Xue fed a bowl of medicine for a long time before it was completely taken by Misha.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, although the medicine is bitter, but you would be fine after drinking it!\u201d Xia Xue gently wiped the medicine from the corners of Misha\u2019s mouth. Now, Misha lay so well-behaved. Although, he was still in come, but aside from a pale complexion, he looked like he was asleep.</p><br/><p>Xia Xue\u2019s hand gentle moved over that innocent face of Misha. Her eyes were full of love. If they could continue to be like this was also not bad\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the still beautiful face of Misha even when he was in coma, Xia Xue\u2019s heart felt a warmth. Could he kiss young master\u2019s lips once again? Xia Xue struggled in her heart. In the end, the love for Misha broke through her mind.</p><br/><p>She lowered her head and leaned over Misha. His white as porcelain skin was smooth and flawless. Even the sweat pores couldn\u2019t be seen. Also, his long eyelashes were thick like a small brush. The usual charming eyes under the eyelashes was now closed. He was well-behaved like a child. For the first time, Xia Xue discovered that Misha had such a quiet side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master\u2026,\u201d Xia Xue\u2019s face was a bit red. She didn\u2019t know if this was considered offending Misha or not, but she really loves Misha very much. When he was awake, she couldn\u2019t do anything. Now, he was unconscious, she could take the opportunity and do things she normally didn\u2019t dare to do.</p><br/><p>Just when Xia Xue closed her eyes and wanted to kiss Misha\u2019s lips, Misha\u2019s right eye suddenly opened and looked at Xia Xue who was getting closer and closer to him.</p><br/><p>Just when Xia Xue thought that she was about to touch those soft lips, a hoarse voice spread to her ear, \u201cXia Xue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Xue abruptly opened her eyes and looked at that pair of cold and dull eyes of Misha. The bowl in her hand made a \u2018kuangdang!\u2019 sound. It fell on the ground and was smashed into pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Xia Xue, what had happened?\u201d At the door, grandma Li once again came in with a bowl of black medicine. Hearing the sound, her steps sped up. She approached and saw the woken up Misha.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya! It\u2019s really a happy occasion as big as the sky! So great! Miss Xia Xue, your husband has woken up! Amitabha, buddha\u2019s protection!\u201d Grandma Li put the bowl down and bowed to the buddha stature on the wall. The appearance of grandma Li dissolved Xia Xue\u2019s embarrassment. She quickly got up and sat well. She pretended like nothing had happened, but her face was burning.</p><br/><p>Only when grandma Li said some more congratulatory words and left, did Xia Xue look at Misha again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou told her that we are husband and wife?\u201d Now, Misha had woken up completely. He seemed to have realized from the pain, that something had happened to his left eye. There weren\u2019t any thunderstorms that Xia Xue was expecting. This time, Misha was abnormally quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, this was a stratagem of convenience. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did good!\u201d Xia Xue wanted to explain, but then she heard Misha\u2019s praise, making her stunned.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xia Xue was somewhat in a daze, Misha laughed, \u201cWhat? Became silly? Thought that I would scold you? It turns out that I\u2019m such a cold and heartless person in your heart, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, young master isn\u2019t such a person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Xue, thank you for saving me!\u201d Misha smiled faintly. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, I may have been buried in the Red River.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what I should do!\u201d Misha\u2019s politeness and tenderness made Xia Xue feel somewhat overwhelmed. \u201cYoung master, you were in a coma for a month. You don\u2019t know how worried I was!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! One month!\u201d Misha was shocked after hearing this news. He struggled to sit up. \u201cWhere are we now? Did Bei Zhou send the troops to Dong Lu? How is the situation now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, we\u2019re in Bei Zhou and are far from Dong Lu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPack up. Go to Dong Lu!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Wangfu: residence of the first-rank prince</p><br/><p>2. Wang/wangye: first-rank prince</p><br/>\n</div>"}

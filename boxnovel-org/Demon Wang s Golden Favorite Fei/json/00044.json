Long before Feng Cang opened his mouth, her ears were covered by his big hands as if he feared his voice would hurt her. It seemed that he didn\u2019t find out everything about her. That\u2019s very good.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026 \u2026,\u201d Longze Yu coughed twice, embarrassed. The whole scene became chaotic because of Feng Cang. Those eunuchs and maids knew they did wrong. All of them were kneeling on the ground, trembling in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetreat, retreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Longze Yu didn\u2019t punish them. Although these people made him lose face, but what difference was there between him and those people? Wasn\u2019t he also attracted by his face? Really lost face at his own home!</p><br/><p>Only then did the people notice the girl standing next to Feng Cang. For a time, no one recognized Murong Qi Qi. Even Murong Tai didn\u2019t recognize his own daughter. Instead, he was wondering who this girl was. Could it be that Feng Cang wanted to break the engagement? And wanted to marry this beauty?</p><br/><p>Seeing that she had become the focus of many, Murong Qi Qi was about to greet the emperor and empress who were sitting on the top seat but was pulled up by Feng Cang, who didn\u2019t let her kneel. Why should his people bow and bend the knee for others? He will not allow it!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, our seat is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang gently held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hand and led her to their specified seat. His gestures were so gifted and noble, making those women\u2019s eyes almost fall out from envy. All of them were speculating as to who this girl was. What did she have to be able to accompany such a man?</p><br/><p>However, the one who first recognized Murong Qi Qi was Murong Xue Lian. After all, she\u2019s a country\u2019s imperial noble consort. Although Feng Cang was indeed attractive, she knew that the only man she could rely on was this man next to her. That\u2019s why she collected her heart back quickly and observed the girl next to Feng Cang. That appearance was somewhat similar to the Murong Qi Qi from her memories, but Murong Xue Lian wasn\u2019t very sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird little sister\u2026\u2026,\u201d Murong Xue Lian decided to test the waters.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to eldest sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi smiled and raised her head. She finally saw her big sister of the same mother and father. But when she saw Murong Xue Lian, she was somewhat surprised.</p><br/><p>Murong Xue Lian\u2019s features are lovely. She has an oval face, petal-like eyebrows, almond eyes, cherry lips; she\u2019s born with a seductive appearance which seems to emit from her bones. But as her sister of the same mother and father, why are her own looks so different from Murong Xue Lian?</p><br/><p>On Murong Xue Lian\u2019s body, you could still see Murong Tai\u2019s shadow. Even the other people in xiangfu1 looked like Murong Tai, but on her own body, it\u2019s something that cannot be found. Could it be that she resembles Li Qui Shui?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that Li Qui Shui had entered the temple after she was born. Seeing her just once seems harder than seeing the emperor\u2026 \u2026a small question mark appeared in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Murong Qi Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now it\u2019s Longze Yu Er\u2019s turn to be surprised. Her eyes were full of disbelief. When she saw Murong Qi Qi\u2019s dress, Longze Yu Er\u2019s eyes slowly turned from surprise to hatred.</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s shout attracted the attention of several people to Murong Qi Qi. After looking at her from head to toe, everyone sighed. Really people rely on clothes, Buddha demands gold adornments.</p><br/><p>People rely on clothes: clothes make the people</p><br/><p>Buddha demand gold adornments????: I don\u2019t know what this means. I think it means that even Buddha demands gold to be seen as Buddha.</p><br/><p>Earlier on, the matter of Longze Yu Er fighting with Feng Cang over the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 had been spread throughout the whole capital. All the people present knew about the matter. Now seeing the dress on Murong Qi Qi, the women exclaimed. The originally ordinary Murong Qi Qi had been made like an angel by this dress. Who didn\u2019t want such an outcome?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god! When I go back, I need to make a trip to Jue Se Fang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, you need to buy for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Various types of voices reached Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ears. Her heart has long been so happy that it bloomed like a flower. It seems that giving that \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 to Feng Cang was a good idea. After today\u2019s advertisement, Jue Se Fang\u2019s business will probably have a good start in Xi Qi. By that time, countless gold and silver will go into her pocket.</p><br/><p>And when the eyes of those women moved from Murong Qi Qi\u2019s body to the crown on her head, Murong Qi Qi felt envy, jealousy and hatred coming from them. Even the empress Duanmu Qing was attracted by that gorgeous crown. She couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cIs this the new work of Guang Hua gongzi2\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi glanced once at Feng Cang. Only when he nodded did she answer Duanmu Qing: \u201cAnswering empress niangniang3, \u2018Autumn flower\u2019 is Tong Bao Zhai\u2019s treasure at Bei Zhou and has been bought for me by wangye4.\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, a faint red appeared on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cheeks. When looking at it, people thought she was shy and also made people feel surprised at the level of Feng Cang\u2019s care towards Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>However, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words also aroused all the women\u2019s dislike for Longze Yu Er even more. If it wasn\u2019t because of her, would Guang Hua gongzi have migrated Tong Bao Zhai to Bei Zhou? In the future, if they wanted to buy those fine jewelries, it would be so much trouble. They would have to get it from Bei Zhou. This was the \u2018good thing\u2019 that this insensible princess did!</p><br/><p>Sensing the hostility from the women, Longze Yu Er\u2019s gaze fiercely swept once over the crowd, forcing those people to lower their heads. But when her gaze met Murong Qi Qi\u2019s, Longze Yu Er clearly saw the ridicule in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s eyes and also the provocation.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. It\u2019s provocation! Murong Qi Qi\u2019s black and white eyes was entirely full of provocation!</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er clutched her sleeves. Her teeth rattled. That\u2019s right, she regretted it! If she had known sooner that Feng Cang was such a figure, no matter what, she wouldn\u2019t have listened to the rumors and missed this marriage.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Longze Yu Er had long forgotten the words Duanmu Qing usually told her. Also Bai Mu Fei, Bai Fu\u2019s eldest daughter-in-law, all of this, she threw them to the back of her mind. In her eyes, there\u2019s only Feng Cang and also \u2018Gold thread dress\u2019 and that dazzling \u2018Autumn flower\u2019.</p><br/><p>All of these should have been mine! No matter if it\u2019s the handsome Feng Cang, or other things, they should have been hers! Why are they now that rubbish\u2019s?! This is not fair!</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s head was filled with such thoughts. From her point of view, all of this was Murong Qi Qi\u2019s fault. It\u2019s she who stole everything that belonged to her. Feng Cang\u2019s gentleness, his smile, all of this should have belonged to her, Longze Yu Er. But now they were occupied by Murong Qi Qi, she occupied her territory!</p><br/><p>Longze Yu Er\u2019s dark expression and her eyes full of hatred, Murong Qi Qi was very familiar with them.</p><br/><p>It seemed that today wouldn\u2019t pass in ease! But it also seemed that it\u2019s been a long time since she had encountered such a fun thing. Besides, she lived cowardly for so long. It\u2019s time to counterattack. Some people still owe her a debt. Before leaving Xi Qi, she must let them repay her back. Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi revealed a tempting smile.</p><br/><p>The smile on Murong Qi Qi\u2019s mouth was directly defined as \u2018sarcasm\u2019 by Longze Yu Er, making the last string of sensibleness in her head snap.</p><br/><p>No, what belonged to her, she must win it back! Why should she let Murong Qi Qi have it?! She is nobler than Murong Qi Qi. She is more beautiful than Murong Qi Qi. No matter where, she is stronger than Murong Qi Qi. Why should she surrender her belongings to Murong Qi Qi?!</p><br/><p>1. Xiangfu: residence of a prime minster </p><br/><p>2. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer a famous man </p><br/><p>3.

She stood up and left Wanyan Kang\u2019s sight. She took down the phoenix coronet and hairpins from her head and loosened her hair. Su Mei rubbed her tummy and looked pitifully at Wanyan Kang. \u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d</p><br/><p>A \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d made Wanyan Kang remember that Su Mei hadn\u2019t eaten ever since she gotten on the palanquin. She must certainly be very hungry. Wanyan Kang immediately called people to bring in hot meals. \u201cEat slowly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t know if Wanyan Kang was very excited or very nervous, he actually had forgotten about the most important step: sharing the nuptial cup of wine. Su Mei twitched her mouth and refused to pick up the chopsticks, making Wanyan Kang puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Is it that you don\u2019t like these foods? Do you want me to let people prepare another meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Wanyan Kang still didn\u2019t understand, Su Mei pointed at the nuptial wine with her finger. The moment Wanyan Kang looked, he slapped his forehead. \u201cAiya, I forgot! I\u2019m really too muddle-headed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang personally poured two cups of wine. He gave one to Su Mei. He took the other one.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei er[Er: term of endearment], after drinking the nuptial cup of wine, we will be husband and wife! To be able to have you is my blessing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two huge dragon-phoenix candles were burning greatly. The orange light plated Su Mei with a mysterious veil. Wanyan Kang\u2019s throat tightened. He put his arm around Su Mei\u2019s and drank the marital wine with her. The burning wine crawled in Wanyan Kang\u2019s throat and blurred his eyes.</p><br/><p>Su Mei was really hungry. Although, just now, the matron of honor also gave her some dessert, but she didn\u2019t have dinner. How could snacks fill her?! She ignored Wanyan Kang\u2019s burning eyes, Su Mei picked up the chopsticks and began to eat.</p><br/><p>Probably, she had gone hungry for a long time, so Su Mei ate very well. Just looking at Su Mei eat, Wanyan Kang\u2019s heart felt like it had eaten honey. His right hand supported his chin and looked with a satisfied look at Su Mei. Her small cheeks went up and down. Really so cute.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s eyes full of desire made Su Mei\u2019s body numb. \u201cAre you not hungry? Do you want to eat some?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m full just by looking at you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sweet words made Su Mei blush. She spouted out the rice in her mouth. They fell on Wanyan Kang\u2019s face like little stars. Su Mei was embarrassed. She quickly reached out to wipe Wanyan Kang\u2019s face. \u201cSorry, I was excited\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Eat slowly!\u201d Now, Wanyan Kang just kept on a smile that was able to make people feel very sweet. After a whole meal, Su Mei suspected if there would be a problem with Wanyan Kang\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>Finally, it was time for the most important thing. Although, Su Mei was a hot-tempered girl, but as a girl, she couldn\u2019t help but be nervous at the wedding night.</p><br/><p>Avoiding Wanyan Kang\u2019s hot gaze, Su Mei hid in the bathtub. \u201cDon\u2019t come in, did you hear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard! I\u2019m also going to take a bath!\u201d Knowing that Su Mei was shy, Wanyan Kang was very happy. He smelled his body. It was full of the smell of alcohol. He let people prepare the water and also comfortably soaked himself in the tub.</p><br/><p>There was only a wall between the two. Su Mei could clearly hear Wanyan Kang sing at the other side. There was also the sound of water hitting him.</p><br/><p>While Wanyan Kang was making noise, he also listened to the movements of Su Mei\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Contrary to him, that side was quiet. There was only a slight noise. What was Su Mei doing? Wanyan Kang was curious. In his head emerged the image of a beauty emerging from the bathtub. While thinking, Wanyan Kang felt something hot on his nose. When he touched, it was actually two lines of hot nose-blood.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s face burned badly. He quickly dived his head into the tub. He didn\u2019t expect that the pressure was too much, his foot slipped. His whole body fell. He choked and drank a few mouthfuls of water. \u201cCough, cough, cough!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sounds coming from the other side surprised Su Mei. Hearing that the sound wasn\u2019t right, Su Mei stood up. She didn\u2019t had time to wipe her body, directly pulled a dress and put it on. Then, she rushed to Wanyan Kang\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Su Mei was surprised that she didn\u2019t see Wanyan Kang. She quickly walked to the tub. She saw that Wanyan Kang was in the water. There were traces of blood in the water. Su Mei was very surprised. She quickly reached out to pull Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, what\u2019s the matter? What had happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang was choking on water. When he got up, the water splattered all on Su Mei.</p><br/><p>At this time, Su Mei was wholeheartedly worried about Wanyan Kang\u2019s safety. How would she know that the tulle nightdress Feng Qi Qi specially prepared for her was now completely pasted on her body because of the water? The exquisite figure made more blood go to Wanyan Kang\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it serious? What had happened?\u201d Seeing that there was blood under Wanyan Kang\u2019s nose, Su Mei quickly wiped it for him. When she reached out, she hadn\u2019t touched Wanyan Kang\u2019s face yet, her hand was grabbed by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang\u2026\u201d Su Mei followed Wanyan Kang\u2019s gaze and looked at her body. When she saw the graceful body wrapped in red muslin, Su Mei almost screamed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Putong\u2026\u2019 Wanyan Kang pulled Su Mei iton the big bathtub. He wiped the blood under his nose and his eyes looked full of desire at Su Mei. \u201cLittle Mei er, you\u2019re so beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei had never encountered such a thing. The original warm water became hot with her joining in.</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang was completely naked. His strong arms tightly held Su Mei\u2019s thin waist to keep her close to him and forbidding her from escaping.</p><br/><p>Could it be that her wedding night would be held here? Feeling Wanyan Kang\u2019s firmness and hotness, Su Mei\u2019s blood rushed to her face. She wasn\u2019t a shy woman, but she had never expected that her career of a woman would begin in a tub. It was really too shameful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei er, I\u2019m suffering from excessive internal heat! Help me lessen the heat, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although, usually Wanyan Kang was all smiles and didn\u2019t have any seriousness in him, but it was very rare for him to be so passionate and enthusiastic.</p><br/><p>Su Mei felt that the room was very hot. The water was also very hot. Even Wanyan Kang\u2019s skin that was close to her was boiling. There was a moment that Su Mei almost forgot who she was and where she was. In her eyes, there was only Wanyan Kang and she could only see Wanyan Kang.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t say anything, I\u2019ll take it that you consented. Then, I will begin tasting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s breathing was a bit quick. He tried to adjust his breathing and let himself calm down.</p><br/><p>He was a bit ashamed. Although he was born in the imperial family and was extremely noble, but he didn\u2019t have any women even at this age. Not to mention, cefei1, concubines etc. Presumably people with similarities flock to each other. After spending much time with Feng Cang, Wanyan Kang also had a kind of phobia towards women. If he didn\u2019t love her, he wouldn\u2019t touch her.</p><br/><p>Those imperial brothers of his didn\u2019t come of age yet, when they had countless of women around them. After becoming an adult, the number of women around them were uncountable. Only a prince like him was still persisting in this area. Although, before his mother consort Lin Ke Xin once wanted to let this son \u2018start to understand things\u2019, so, she stuffed a few women at him, but he got rid of time with all kinds of excuses.</p><br/><p>Now, Wanyan Kang was very grateful for his insistence. It was precisely because of this that he could wait for the woman he loved the most in this life\u2026Su Mei.</p><br/><p>The temperature gradually rose. Wanyan Kang\u2019s breathing became heavy. His hands held Su Mei\u2019s waist. His face got closer to hers. Little by little, closer and closer. Su Mei seemed to understand what Wanyan Kang wanted to do. She obediently closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>Just when Su Mei thought that Wanyan Kang would kiss her lips, a warmth came from her ear. It turned out that his first kiss fell on her ear\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei er, I love you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei er, you\u2019re so beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang, we\u2019re husband and wife. I only have one request! No matter what kind of experiences you had in the past, no matter how many women you had had in the past, from now on, you can only have me!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the misty water, Su Mei\u2019s exquisite and charming features became more charming. Those words came from her red lips made them look more tempting.</p><br/><p>Su Mei put forward such a request when the wedding night was about to begin let Wanyan Kang couldn\u2019t help but bit her nose. \u201cLittle girl, what are you thinking about?! I didn\u2019t have anyone in the past. From now on, I will only have you. In the later life, I will only have you! I promise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang wanted to raise his hand to promise but was stopped by Su Mei. \u201cI believe you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Si Mei trusted Wanyan Kang sincerely. Although, usually this person wasn\u2019t serious enough, but he was someone who would keep his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei er\u2026\u201d Wanyan Kang\u2019s voice was a bit hoarse. He had endured for so long. When the time came, this woman still had the mind to talk about something else. This really and simply made Wanyan Kang unable to it endure anymore. \u201cLittle Mei er, I want you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Kang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me Kang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hot water wrapped the lovers. Inside the misty fog, these two lovers finally became one\u2026</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t know how much time had passed. When Su Mei woke up, she discovered that she was laying on a bed. An arm was on her waist. From her ears came the sound of Wanyan Kang\u2019s breathing. Only now did Su Mei remember that this was her wedding night.</p><br/><p>She wanted to move but discovered that she only moved slightly when her body felt a soreness that made her feel at loss. Although, Wanyan Kang had been very gentle, but this strong and young man still couldn\u2019t hold back in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cScoundrel!\u201d Su Mei moved carefully. She finally turned and looked at the sleeping Wanyan Kang. He slept comfortable at the moment while she felt like she was falling apart. This guy was simply a gluttonous cat that couldn\u2019t get enough. Until late in the night did he release her.</p><br/><p>However, this kind of soreness filled Su Mei\u2019s heart. She had never tasted this kind of happiness. From now on, she has a lover, has a husband. She is no longer alone.</p><br/><p>Su Mei held Wanyan Kang\u2019s arm and closed her eyes. Her mouth revealed a sweet smile.</p><br/><p>Su Mei slept till the sun was very high before she woke up. Wanyan Kang was already not at her side. It was bright outside the window. It seemed that today was a sunny day.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangfei2 is awake? This slave will help you wash your face and rinse the mouth!\u201d Hearing the motion inside the room, the maid who stood outside immediately went to prepare warm water and helped Su Mei take a bath. She also helped Su Mei dress into a red dress of a wangfei . Only after all of these were done did Su Mei remember to ask about Wanyan Kang. \u201cWhere\u2019s wangye3?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye is in the study. He said that wangfei worked hard and to let this slave not bother wangfei\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Su Mei\u2019s ears got red. This Wanyan Kang could really say anything!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei er, you woke up? Why didn\u2019t you sleep a bit more?!\u201d After hearing that Su Mei woke up, Wanyan Kang immediately rushed over. He didn\u2019t care that there were others around and took Su Mei\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, ah, why didn\u2019t you wake me?! Didn\u2019t we have to go pay our respect to the grand empress dowager and emperor today?! It\u2019s already so late. If we go to the palace now, we will certainly be laughed at\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Imperial grandmother had already sent someone to give us a holiday. We don\u2019t have to go to the palace. Also, little Mei er, why are you calling imperial grandmother grand empress dowager?! You\u2019re now my wife. You should call her grandmother like me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang\u2019s \u2018you\u2019re now my wife\u2019 let a warmth enter Su Mei\u2019s heart. That\u2019s right. He\u2019s her husband. He\u2019s her family in this world! This feeling was really good!</p><br/><p>Originally, Su Mei wanted to go to the regent\u2019s palace to visit Feng Qi Qi. She didn\u2019t expect that Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang were also very \u2018understanding\u2019. They sent someone over to let them have the world of two people.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin brother and cousin-in-law are very considerate, ah!\u201d When Wanyan Kang\u2019s words reached Su Mei\u2019s ear, Su Mei reached out and pinched Wanyan Kang\u2019s waist, making Wanyan Kang shout from pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved consort, do you want to murder me, ah?!\u201d Wanyan Kang grimaced in pain and made strange expressions. The maids covered their mouths and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all, retreat first. I\u2019ve something to say to wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>After all the maids left and only Su Mei and Wanyan Kang were left, Su Mei reached out and grabbed Wanyan Kang\u2019s ear. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see that there were others around?! You say that, is it that you want people to laugh at me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurt, hurt, hurt! Little Mei er, have mercy, ah!\u201d Wanyan Kang began to scream. \u201cWasn\u2019t I only not aware that there were others around?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithdraw all these people. I don\u2019t need anyone to serve me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alight, alight! I won\u2019t let anyone serve! We eat off our own strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Mei only let go after receiving Wanyan Kang\u2019s assent. Wanyan Kang rubbed his ear and pouted as if he had suffered much grievances. \u201cLittle Mei er, you\u2019re so heartless! I\u2019m a bit sceptical whether that gentle woman of last night was you! Why are you so different during the day and night\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill talking?!\u201d Seeing that Wanyan Kang mentioned the matter of last night, Su Mei\u2019s face was tainted with a pinkish color. \u201cIf you continue to talk, I\u2019ll ignore you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, alright. I won\u2019t talk anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Kang knew that Su Mei was shy. New brides were always like this. He was very happy to see a different side of Su Mei. And, such a Su Mei only bloomed for him.</p><br/><p>After three days, Su Mei went \u2018back home\u2019 with Wanyan Kang. The home was naturally referring to the regent\u2019s palace. Hearing that Su Mei had returned, Feng Qi Qi specifically went to the door to meet her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d The moment she went down the carriage and saw Feng Qi Qi, Su Mei quickly went forward. She was just about to bow when she was stopped by Feng Qi Qi. \u201cYou\u2019re now my sister-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, miss is forever miss!\u201d Su Mei greeted Feng Qi Qi respectfully. Wanyan Kang didn\u2019t stop this. He knew about Su Mei and Feng Qi Qi\u2019s relationship. He also knew that without Feng Qi Qi, there wouldn\u2019t be the Su Mei of today and it would be impossible for him to have a happy marriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Quickly get up! Let\u2019s go inside!\u201d</p><br/><p>After entering the palace, Su Mei was pulled inside Tingsong building by Feng Qi Qi and Su Yue. Wanyan Kang followed Feng Cang to the study.</p><br/><p>Once she entered Tingsong building, Su Mei eagerly wanted to go see Feng Xiao. She really missed this little shizi4 after not seeing hm for a few days. These past days, she was the one who personally had taken care of Feng Xiao. She was really not used to being separated for three days from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, little shizi grew again!\u201d Su Mei teased Feng Xiao. Her appearance made Feng Qi Qi and Su Yu exchange a smile. \u201cSu Mei, if you like children, quickly give birth to one! You and ah Kang\u2019s child would certainly be very beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue\u2019s words made Su Mei blush. \u201cYou should be the one to give birth first, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yue only laughed but didn\u2019t answer Su Mei. Feng Qi Qi took Su Yue\u2019 hand and helped her say it. \u201cSu Mei, you don\u2019t know. Our Su Yue is already a month pregnant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d After hearing this news, Su Mei happily stepped forward and hugged Su Yue. \u201cSu Yue, congratulations! So great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Su Yue blushed. Her small hand was on her lower abdomen. Her face showed sweetness and happiness. Recently, she was busy looking after Feng Qi Qi. Her period hadn\u2019t come for a long time. Yesterday, Feng Qi Qi checked for her and discovered that she was pregnant. After knowing this news, Nalan Xin literally carried Su Yue and run several laps. Only when Su Yue said that she was dizzy did Nalan Xin put her down.</p><br/><p>Now that Su Yue was pregnant, Su Mei and Feng Qi Qi were happy for her. The three of them had been together the longest. They were like sisters. Now, each one of them had found their own happiness. Su Yue was also pregnant. This was simply the best news for everyone.</p><br/><p>Inside the study, after hearing that Su Yue was pregnant, Wanyan Kang quickly congratulated Nalan Xin.</p><br/><p>Although, the child in Su Yue\u2019s belly was only one month, but Nalan Xin, this prospective father could already imagine what his child would look like. Recently, after seeing Feng Xiao so much, Nalan Xin really wished that he could also have such a well-behaved child. He didn\u2019t expect that he only thought about it, heavens really gave them one. This was really a gift from heaven.</p><br/><p>Because Su Yue was pregnant and Su Mei just married, Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang who originally planned to go to Nan Feng, delayed the time. Su Mei and Su Yue always had a good relationship with Feng Qi Qi. If Feng Qi Qi went to Nan Feng, these two people would certainly follow. However, now Su Mei was newly married and Su Yue was pregnant. The two of them couldn\u2019t go.</p><br/><p>Although, Feng Qi Qi wanted to leave Su Mei and Su Yue in the capital, but they firmly refused to agree. Su Yue also said if miss left them and go to Nan Feng alone, she would certainly follow even with her pregnancy.</p><br/><p>1.

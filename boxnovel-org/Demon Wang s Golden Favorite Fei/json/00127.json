Now, he knew wangfei\u2019s \u2018secret\u2019. Feng Cang, who had such a strong personality, naturally wouldn\u2019t tolerate this.</p><br/><p>After all, Guanghua gongzi3 had a good reputation. Before, wangye praised Guanghua gongzi for withstanding the pressure \u2013 that evil and good couldn\u2019t coexist- and still be together with Du Xian Er. He also praised that they were an outstanding couple of the jianghu4. Now that he knew Du Xian Er was wangfei, wangye couldn\u2019t hold it any longer and also couldn\u2019t calm down.</p><br/><p>However, not only Feng Cang, even Nalan Xin was shocked at this result.</p><br/><p>Wangfei was such a gentle and lovely woman, how could she had anything to do with the Du Xian Er, the one who caused people\u2019s faces to change colour whenever they heard her name? Nalan Xin truly couldn\u2019t imagine it.</p><br/><p>In the jianghu, there were many rumors about Du Xian Er. No matter if it was vicious and merciless, or killed people as though she was cutting grass, Nalan Xin didn\u2019t see these actions with his own eyes so he didn\u2019t think it was believable. However, at the very least, Moyu had flourished in these five years after it was put in Du Xian Er\u2019s hands. This was an indisputable fact. This woman had the ability and the courage and was a rising star in the jianghu.</p><br/><p>It was just, Du Xian Er was wangfei? Wangfei was Du Xian Er? Nalan Xin still hadn\u2019t recovered about this from the moment he got the news.</p><br/><p>Although there hadn\u2019t been much contact between him and Murong Qi Qi, but when he was a teacher at the Murong household, he had taught Murong Qi Qi lessons for some time. During that period, he didn\u2019t notice anything strange from Murong Qi Qi, ah.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t really verify Murong Qi Qi\u2019s identity, he truly wouldn\u2019t be able to accept that wangfei was Du Xian Er.</p><br/><p>However, after thinking about it carefully, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find the similarities between Murong Qi Qi and Du Xian Er. Outside, it was rumored that Murong Qi Qi was a rubbish. However, how could a rubbish pass the tournament of the four countries? Let alone pass the finals!</p><br/><p>No matter if it was against Guli or Murong Qing Lian, from beginning to end, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s weapon had been a red muslin. To be able to manipulate a red muslin like it was her own body, how could a person like this not be a master?! It seemed that there were times they had seen a person wrongly.</p><br/><p>Presumably, after finding out wangfei\u2019s identity, wangye must have been very shocked!</p><br/><p>Previously, when the rumors about Du Xian Er and Guanghua gongzi had spread out, wangye was relieved and felt that Du Xian Er\u2019s marriage had been solved. He also could justify himself to that old poisonous fart of Moyu. Now, Du Xian Er was wangfei and he loved wangfei so much. Between the two, a Guanghua gongzi fell from the sky as the third party; wangye must feel very anxious and uncomfortable in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s not very good to touch Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai. It seems\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin hadn\u2019t finished speaking when he was interrupted by Feng Cang. He (FC) stood up. His phoenix eyes narrowed. From the icy purple eyes exuded a strong chillness, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Touching Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai is just to scratch the outside of the boot. I\u2019ll kill him to avoid danger in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>To scratch the outside of the boot: ineffectual</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words made Nalan Xin stunned. He was dumbfounded for a moment. Then, Nalan Xin softly asked, \u201cWangye, you\u2026you mean kill Guanghua gongzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! He dared to touch my woman, he also needs to have the ability to withstand my anger!\u201d</p><br/><p>What did that have to do with this?! Nalan Xin almost fainted. Just now, he wanted to persuade Feng Cang to consider the balance of powers in the jianghu and not to touch Guanghua gongzi for now. However, now master wanted to directly kill Guanghua gongzi?</p><br/><p>Heavens, master must have surely been carried away by jealousy. Could it be that he didn\u2019t know Guanghua gongzi\u2019s prestige among the commoners? Could it be that he didn\u2019t know that killing Guanghua gongzi would let all the women in the world rebel? This was simply making everyone an enemy, ah!</p><br/><p>Since ancient times, the most dangerous wind is the pillow talk. Although there was nothing to fear from those women, but in this world, there was no woman who didn\u2019t like Guanghua gongzi\u2019s clothes and jewelries.</p><br/><p>Wind: pillow talk/intimate conversation in bed</p><br/><p>Killing Guanghua gongzi was the same as killing the longing in their hearts for beautiful things. Forget those women crying, in case they blew wind at their men, then what to do? Many of them would be from the jianghu, from the court and also from the imperial family. If that wind blew up, it could sweep the mainland completely, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, Guanghua gongzi is not an ordinary character. Below, you have the merchants; above, you have the nobility. As long as there\u2019s a place with a mistress, there would be no place who didn\u2019t love Tong Bai Zhai and Jue Se Fang. Even the empress dowager in the palace couldn\u2019t praise Tong Bao Zhai\u2019s jewelries enough\u2026If you really touch Guanghua gongzi, the tears of those women would be enough to flood Yan capital!\u201d</p><br/><p>What Nalan Xin said was the truth. However, his words got converted into another meaning in Feng Cang\u2019s ears, \u201cHe\u2019s but a man who relies on women!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough!\u201d Nalan Xin was choked by his saliva. These words from Feng Cang was too mean. If Guanghua gongzi truly relied on women, and he (G) and wangfei were a couple; then didn\u2019t that mean that wangfei is maintaining a gigolo?! Wangfei maintaining a gigolo, then what is wangye? Green hat? Nalan Xin couldn\u2019t help but stare at Feng Cang\u2019s head\u2026</p><br/><p>Green hat: cuckhold</p><br/><p>Nalan Xin\u2019s expression was strange. Now, Feng Cang also became aware of the strangeness in his words. He also coughed twice, \u201cIn short, there are three steps to deal with a rival. First, inquire about the actual situation. Second, determine each position. Then, kill in one shot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Feng Cang\u2019s words, Nalan Xin almost spat out blood. What\u2019s the matter with wangye? He\u2019s actually using military strategies to deal with a rival. Really rare!</p><br/><p>Feng Cang had never been as tense as now. Although there were many stinky flies at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side; for example, the put things out in the open Longze Jing Tian. Another example, Wanyan Hong, who operated secretly. Another example, the proper Li Yun Qing\u2026However, they were all people he had seen in person and they had exchanged some blows.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a saying: easy to dodge a spear in the open, hard to avoid a stab in the dark. He had been busy guarding against the flies, so he didn\u2019t know when this outstanding Guanghua gongzi captured his little wangfei. How could he endure this?</p><br/><p>Easy to dodge a spear in the open, hard to avoid a stab in the dark: hard to guard against secret conspiracies</p><br/><p>Not to mention, he had seen those other rotten and stinky flies. That Guanghua gongzi was elusive. Even though he\u2019d guarded his little wangfei tightly day and night, but they\u2019d still kept in contact. Besides, they\u2019d also become a famous couple of the jianghu. How could Feng Cang accept this?!</p><br/><p>When did they get to know each other? How long had it been since they\u2019ve known each other? When did their feelings blossom? Under his strict guarding, how did this Guanghua gongzi contact Murong Qi Qi? These questions puzzled Feng Cang, making his mind unable to turn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, since you have so many headaches, why don\u2019t you go ask wangfei? From this subordinate\u2019s point of view, wangfei still cares very much about you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Feng Cang rejected Nalan Xin\u2019s suggestion. If Murong Qi Qi told him a heart-piercing and heartbroken result, then what should he do? If Murong Qi Qi says that she\u2019s only temporarily living here and in the future, she would fly away with Guanghua gongzi, he was afraid that he would really do something terrible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, the most important thing between lovers is honesty. Since you love wangfei, why don\u2019t you frankly tell her your thoughts? You need to communicate more, communicate more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Feng Cang gritted his teeth. He didn\u2019t want love out of sympathy and didn\u2019t want Murong Qi Qi to give him love out of charity.</p><br/><p>Since Murong Qi Qi was Du Xian Er, then she must have known about those rumors of her and Guanghua gongzi. She knew and still let such rumors appear. With his understanding of Murong Qi Qi, Guanghua gongzi must weigh very much in her heart.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang was somewhat nervous. He was afraid that between Guanghua gongzi and him, Murong Qi Qi would choose Guanghua gongzi. He couldn\u2019t make himself go face this truth.</p><br/><p>Seeing Feng Cang\u2019s complex expression, Nalan Xin felt even more that love was a torturing thing. The originally wise and like an immortal wangye, why would he always lose his reasoning when encountering matters related to wangfei? Could this be the so called \u2018those involved couldn\u2019t see clearly\u2019?</p><br/><p>It seemed that no matter what he says, wangye wouldn\u2019t accept. He might as well let their passion collude once again.</p><br/><p>Since Guanghua gongzi was an opportunity, why not use this opportunity to let wangye and wangfei\u2019s heart come closer to each other?! It was just, if Guanghua gongzi truly blocked wangye\u2019s road of love, no need for wangye to speak, he would clean the road for wangye.</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Nalan Xin no longer expressed his views. He only waited for Feng Cang\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what method you use, but I want you to find Guanghua gongzi in the shortest time possible. If he doesn\u2019t show his face, then clean Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang with blood. I don\u2019t believe that he still won\u2019t come out after being forced like this! I want to personally see what kind of person this rival is. He dared to have ideas about my woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Toward this wangye who was full of jealousy, Nalan Xin knew that opposing wouldn\u2019t work. The only way was to find Guanghua gongzi, tie him up in front of wangye and let them pk. Otherwise, wangye\u2019s vinegar would flood the entire Bei Zhou.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang stayed in the study a long time for the matter of Guanghua gongzi. When he returned to Tingsong building, it was already night. Murong Qi Qi had long changed clothes and slept. Seeing that calm face of Murong Qi Qi under the candlelight, Feng Cang reached out and gently stroked her slightly furrowed brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, I won\u2019t let go! I will even bring you to heaven or hell! Also, don\u2019t think to break free from me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing that there was someone, Murong Qi Qi slowly opened her eyes. When she saw Feng Cang, she yawned lazily, \u201cYou returned!\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence let Feng Cang\u2019s mood become a lot better. It was like a wife waiting at home for the husband to return. She then would use the sentence \u2018you returned\u2019 to eliminate the fatigue from the husband.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll help you take off the outer clothing!\u201d Feng Cang picked up Murong Qi Qi. These past few days, it had been him who helped Murong Qi Qi dress. She seemed particularly incompetent at these cumbersome clothes. She was already so big, but still couldn\u2019t get the inner and outer skirt right. So, Feng Can incumbently became Murong Qi Qi\u2019s \u2018nanny\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi was very sleepy. She closed her eyes and let Feng Cang take off her clothes. When, her body felt cold, the next moment, she was put into a warm blanket by Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Touching a gentle body, Murong Qi Qi climbed to Feng Cang with her eyes closed. \u201cWhy did you return only now?! I waited a long time for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of being sleepy and half conscious, Murong Qi Qi had her eyes closed from beginning to end. Her voice had a trace of whine and blame in it. Feng Cang kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead. He felt how real she was in his arms. His worried heart finally eased down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were some things that needed to be dealt with. That was why I came late. Be good! Sleep! I\u2019m here next to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d Murong Qi Qi nodded. Her small face leant on Feng Cang\u2019s solid shoulder. Her small hands fumbled over Feng Cang\u2019s body for a while, \u201cCang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough, you looked quite thin, but your body still quite had the material, ah! Murong Qi Qi groped with her eyes closed. Her fingers wandered on Feng Cang\u2019s abdomen. \u201cEight packs, Cang, you\u2019re very sexy, oh! Really, a book shouldn\u2019t be judged by its cover, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s small hand continued to explore. She was muddleheaded from sleep; how would she know that her behavior undoubtedly provoked Feng Cang\u2019s male dignity? Just when her hand slipped to his lower abdomen, Feng Cang caught her hand in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang?\u201d Murong Qi Qi was a bit dissatisfied being interrupted by Feng Cang. She strived to open her eyes and looked at Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle lazy cat, I don\u2019t want to get you when you\u2019re muddleheaded!\u201d Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi\u2019s naughty hand and took her into his embrace, \u201cYou must be very tired today after entering the palace. In the future, let\u2019s don\u2019t go anymore! Lest to not get a headache after seeing those people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words successfully changed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s line of sight. She nodded very cooperatively, \u201cThat\u2019s right! In the future, aside from meeting grandmother, we won\u2019t meet anyone else! That crown prince is very annoying. Second prince is also very annoying. Ah Kang is so pitiful. We need to care more about him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Feng Cang chuckled. He touched Murong Qi Qi\u2019s lips. Seeing Murong Qi Qi close her eyes once again, Feng Cang thought about the words Nalan Xin said, be frank, communicate\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, Longze Jing Tian called you Xian Er? Why\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang didn\u2019t know if such behavior was disgraceful or not. At this moment, Murong Qi Qi was very muddleheaded from sleep. Her brain wasn\u2019t working well. Asking her now, she certainly will speak the truth. He took this opportunity to get information from Murong Qi Qi, is it a bit despicable?</p><br/><p>Just a moment, the Feng Cang who thought about being a bit despicable and was a bit ashamed; after seeing Murong Qi Qi\u2019s pinky cheeks, his heart was hit once again.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just be shameless! In any case, Murong Qi Qi is his woman. Even if he needed to give it his all, he still would let her become his physically as mentally! Now, it\u2019s the time to defend and fight for his wife. It was not the time to talk about benevolence and morality. Could it be, to let him shake hands on the battle field with the enemy and say, \u201cHow are you?! Did you have dinner? The weather is not bad today, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if he was polite, those flies who was like wolves wouldn\u2019t because of this, give up the \u2018harassment\u2019 of Murong Qi Qi. If they were polite, they wouldn\u2019t covet his Qing Qing!</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I still have another name called Du Xian Er, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it was the same as what Feng Cang thought. Murong Qi Qi was muddleheaded from sleep. How would she know what sober is? That was why, when Feng Cang asked her, she answered!</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, are you Moyu\u2019s Du Xian Er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Murong Qi Qi pouted and frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t I look like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not like, I am!\u201d Murong Qi Qi yawned a small yawn. Her small mouth came to Feng Cang\u2019s face and \u2018smacked\u2019 his face a bit. \u201cGoodnight, Cang. I\u2019m so sleepy\u2026Also, my heart only has you and doesn\u2019t have him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Murong Qi Qi\u2019s breathing was even. Her mouth was slightly open like petals.</p><br/><p>This woman, ah! She didn\u2019t have any guarding in front of him. Feng Cang deeply kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead. She acknowledged her identity. His heart also got a certain.</p><br/><p>Now, the only problem is the matter of Guanghua gongzi. Could it be that Guanghua gongzi pestered and didn\u2019t want to leave his Qing Qing alone? Otherwise, why would she say that her heart doesn\u2019t have him? Is this \u2018him\u2019 not referring to Guanghua gongzi?</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi had a good sleep. Although Feng Cang hoped he could think the relationship between her and Guanghua gongzi clearly, but he didn\u2019t know why with a beauty in his arms, he was sleepy enough. Not long after, he fell asleep with his arms around Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Since Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang shared a bed, the list of things Su Mei and Su Yue needed to do had become smaller. This guye5 dealt with every matter, regardless of its importance. It made the two of them have less work to do.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang had to go to the morning court every day. He got up early and always put his official robe on very carefully, without a sound. Then, he would leave kisses on both of Murong Qi Qi\u2019s cheeks, her forehead and her lips before leaving. Murong Qi Qi slept in during the winter. She always happened to wake up just when Feng Cang comes back from the morning court.</p><br/><p>So, the work of dressing her became Feng Cang\u2019s work. During these past two days, even Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hair had been done by Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hair was long to her ankles. It slid like satin. Feng Cang loved it very much. So, he simply took over the job of combing her hair over from Su Mei and Su Yue. Although he couldn\u2019t do complicated hairstyles, but he could still do simple braids. It so happens that Murong Qi Qi liked to be simple. So every day, she walked around wangfu6 with a small pigtail.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, guye is really a versatile husband. He\u2019s not only elegant in public but also good in the kitchen.\u201d In the garden, Su Mei and Su Yue, one on each side, accompanied Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>Elegant in public but also good in the kitchen: good husband/wife both domestically and socially. It\u2019s usually used to describe the wife</p><br/><p>These two didn\u2019t know about Feng Cang\u2019s real identity. So, they were scared out of their wits about Feng Cang staying in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s chamber. Although, in these times, there were also marriage between siblings, but the marriages were mostly between cousins. Where were there people like miss and Feng Cang who\u2019re acting like this despite being biological siblings? This was too shocking!</p><br/><p>In China, cousin from the paternal line (cousins with the same surname) were considered brothers and sisters. For example, if my father\u2019s brother had a son/daughter, he will be called eldest brother/sister. My father had a son/daughter, who will be called second brother/sister. And if my father\u2019s brother had a son/daughter again, the son will then be called third brother/daughter. The \u2018cousin\u2019 usually is omitted and I need to only use \u2018brother/sister\u2019 to address them. Even if \u2018cousin\u2019 is still used, which is very rare, it would be tang-ge (big cousin brother) and not the biao-ge (big cousin brother) from the maternal line. It was not so well accepted to marry cousins with the same surname. However, it was accepted to marry cousins from the maternal line (cousins with different surnames).</p><br/><p>But later, seeing that Feng Cang treated Murong Qi Qi with his whole heart, these two gradually accepted it.</p><br/><p>Siblings being lovers was against human relations. However, since miss truly likes him, naturally they hope miss to be happy! It was just, even though they supported Murong Qi Qi, but they were also worried. They feared that this love of miss would never be able to see the daylight! Hiding this, when will it end?!</p><br/><p>Seeing Su Mei teased her, Murong Qi Qi laughed, \u201cAh Kang is also not bad, ah! Recently, he came so much to the wangfu and wished he could move in here\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Su Mei\u2019s face turned red after Murong Qi Qi mentioned Wanyan Kang. She stomped, \u201cMiss, if you continue to be like this, I\u2019ll ignore you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, alright! I won\u2019t speak anymore!\u201d Although Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t spoke, but the laughter in her eyes couldn\u2019t deceive people.</p><br/><p>Su Yue laughed at a side. Su Mei\u2019s face got redder. She didn\u2019t dare to do anything on Murong Qi Qi, Su Mei picked on Su Yue, \u201cSu Yue, don\u2019t laugh at me. I saw on a certain year, a certain month, a certain day and a certain night, you and a certain person were whispering sweet words\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Su Yue also has love affairs now? What is it? Tell me!\u201d The moment Murong Qi Qi heard, her small face was filled with excitement, \u201cWhen did it happen? Who\u2019s the man who had such good eyes? And took a fancy on our Su Yue?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Su Yue who was originally teasing Su Mei, after hearing this was stunned, \u201cWhat did I do? Su Mei, don\u2019t arrange anything for me, ah! Miss, don\u2019t listen to her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk! Not at all! It was on miss\u2019s wedding night. Su Yue and Nalan Xin talked for a long while under the building!\u201d Su Mei saw that Su Yue had a serious look, she immediately broke the news to Murong Qi Qi, \u201cMiss, you don\u2019t know. When Su Yue left, Nalan Xin stared at her back for a long time. While looking, he also laughed foolishly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLass, what are you talking about?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to the hot temper of Su Mei, Su Yue was a lot think skinned. Seeing Su Mei bring up a \u2018groundless\u2019 matter, she explained to Murong Qi Qi, \u201cMiss, it\u2019s not like that! That night, teacher Nalan Xin seemed to look for wangye about something. I stopped him. It was just like that, there\u2019s nothing else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Murong Qi Qi touched her chin and looked thoughtfully at Su Yue, \u201cNalan Xin? He\u2019s not bad! He\u2019s wangye\u2019s people. I can help you two be a match\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Murong Qi Qi talked, the more outrageous the matter became. Su Yue was angry. Her small face was red. She wanted to explain, but she didn\u2019t know how to say it. Now, Su Mei was happy. She applauded at a side, \u201cMiss, why don\u2019t you be Yue Lao and pull a red string to let them become a pair. How great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Lao: the god of marriage</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, you ass!\u201d Su Yue was pressed to much. She finally uttered foul language. \u201cI won\u2019t leave miss. I will serve miss my whole life! If we all leave, who would take care of miss?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Su Yue\u2019s words, Su Mei didn\u2019t laugh any longer. She thought about when sir Mozun passed away. He personally told them to take good care of Murong Qi Qi. If they really all marry, then at Murong Qi Qi\u2019s side there would be no close people.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was miss Duanmu who has gone too far\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister, no matter if third big sister did it on purpose or not, the truth is that she wounded miss Duanmu. If the empress wants to investigate, one \u2018not on purpose\u2019 is not enough to pass the responsibilities!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Murong Xin Lian plead for Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qing Lian rolled her eyes.</p><br/><p>It seemed that in this family no matter old or young have no place for Murong Qi Qi, ah!</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qing Lian\u2019s words, Shangguan Wu Ji couldn\u2019t help but feel heartache for Murong Qi Qi. Living in such a family, being calculated by her sisters and also being disgusted by her own father, he really didn\u2019t know how she survived all these years.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrime minister, the matter that happened just now, third miss really didn\u2019t do it intentionally. It was miss Duanmu who bullied her first. Asking prime minister to not blame third miss too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Wu Ji speaking up for Murong Qi Qi was outside of Murong Tai\u2019s expectation.</p><br/><p>At this time, Bai Mu Fei and Bai Yi Yue also stood out: \u201cIt was really an accident. It has nothing to do with third miss. Prime minister, don\u2019t make things too difficult for third miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>One Shangguan Wu Ji already let Murong Tai be surprised. Now even Bai family\u2019s young master and miss were pleading, made Murong Tai even more surprised. When has Murong Qi Qi\u2019s relationship with people become so good? Two great family are speaking up for her? Could there really be an ulterior motive in this?</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, we are all witnesses in this matter. Even if Duanmu family get this matter in front of the empress, we will also testify for little cousin sister. Uncle doesn\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yun Qing\u2019s last words, gave Murong Tai reassurance. Since there were so many people willing to testify, then he didn\u2019t need to worry about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s matter.</p><br/><p>Seeing others speak up for Murong Qi Qi and Murong Tai seemed to have dispelled the idea of going to look for Murong Qi Qi, Murong Xin Lian became anxious: \u201cDaddy, just now third little sister was somewhat unwell. Why don\u2019t we go see her?! Don\u2019t know if she got sick or not!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if she dies, she deserves it!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Murong Tai threw out this sentence. Li Yun Qing\u2019s and Shangguan Wu Ji\u2019s expression immediately changed.</p><br/><p>Seemed to have realized that his words are too fickle, Murong Tai immediately pulled out a smile. Even if this daughter wasn\u2019t much in his heart, but now there are outsiders. He couldn\u2019t leave a bad impression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go see her! Really troublesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond big sister, let\u2019s also go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qing Lian was really happy. It has been a long time since a thing in the mansion made her happy. Although before she and Murong Xin Lian had some unpleasant things, but bullying Murong Qi Qi this rubbish was her greatest pleasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s also go\u2026\u2026,\u201d Shangguan Wu Ji suggested to the others. He is very worried about Murong Qi Qi. Thinking back the Murong Qi Qi\u2019s expression with her tearful eyes and at this moment seeing the people of Murong fu 1 treating Murong Qi Qi like this, Shangguan Wu Ji felt a pumping pain in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, I also want to go see third miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Bai Yi Yue was also very worried about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s situation. Although she hadn\u2019t come much in contact with her (MQQ), but she liked this third miss from her heart. Now seeing her situation in the prime minister\u2019s mansion, Bai Yi Yue really pitied Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>With the two\u2019s suggestion, Bai Mu Fei and Li Yun Qing also nodded. They followed Murong Tai.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s mood was now very good. The more people, the better. She was worried about that this matter won\u2019t get big. The three great families\u2019 young masters and miss saw Murong fu\u2019s third miss scandal with their own eyes, tomorrow this will spread through all the streets of the capital. Haha ha! Murong Qi Qi, this time, you\u2019re dead!</p><br/><p>Everything was carried out according to Murong Xin Lian\u2019s plan. The closer they get to the room she arranged, the smile on Murong Xin Lian would become bigger. She seemed to have seen the position of Jing wangfei2 waving at her. She even saw Longze Jing Tian smiling gently at her\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dong\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, blood went to Murong Tai\u2019s head. He kicked the door open. Without a word, he rushed to the bed and teared the curtain. When he saw Zheng Min\u2019s expression of being in the seventh heaven, hot blood went in Murong Tai\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlut! You dare to put a green hat on me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Green hat means your wife is cheating on you in china that\u2019s why you won\u2019t see people in particular men wear green hats in china. The story that I found on the internet is about Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty enacted a law, which required men who worked in the prostitution trade to wear green hats. Later, it became common to say about man whose wife had an affair, that she made her husband wear a green hat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Murong Tai slapped Zheng Min in the face, grabbed Zheng Min and pulled her up.</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian heard that the voice was wrong, she immediately let people lighten up the room. The moment the room lightened up, Murong Xin Lian saw a naked Zheng Min kneeling on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, how come it\u2019s you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian\u2019s heart was in a tremendous shock. Should Murong Qi Qi not be in this room? Why was it Zheng Min?</p><br/><p>\u201cOld master, please spare my life! Old master, please spare my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man on the bed casually put on his clothes, came off the bed and immediately knelt down.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld master, it was concubine Zheng who seduced me. It really was concubine Zheng\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when Murong Tai pulled out a sword and cut off his head. A bloody head rolled in front of Zheng Min. Zheng Min screamed: \u201cWa\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlut! You still scream?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just thinking that the younger generation of the three great families saw the scandal of his family and saw that he actually had worn a green hat, Murong Tai was really angry. This matter had been seen by outsiders. How would he continue to live?! The more he thought, the angrier he got. The more he thought, the more fire lit in him. Murong Tai simply didn\u2019t think anymore. A sword pointed at Zheng Min.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Xin Lian wanted to rush inside to save Zheng Min, but Murong Qing Lian stretched her feet making her stumble on the ground. After she got up, the sword has already pierced into Zheng Min\u2019s heart. The blood splashed on Murong Tai\u2019s hem.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Murong Xin Lian cried once and fainted.</p><br/><p>Originally they were going to see Murong Qi Qi. Now they saw the prime minister\u2019s scandal. Li Yun Qing and the others exchanged a look and quietly backed out.</p><br/><p>At this time, Murong Tai was no longer in the mood to go think about Murong Qi Qi\u2019s matter. Seeing that till dead Zheng Min had her eyes open with a shocked expression, Murong Tai felt resentment. He went forward, pulled out the sword and kicked Zheng Min.</p><br/><p>According to Xi Qi country\u2019s law, when a wife is caught on spot having an affair, she could be killed immediately. The law will not hold the man responsible. That\u2019s why Murong Tai flew into rage out of humiliation and killed Zheng Min.</p><br/><p>\u201cServants!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai called the housekeeper Chen Zhong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThrow this couple out to feed the dogs. Today\u2019s matter no one was allowed to spread it out, otherwise don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Tai\u2019s ruthlessness made Chen Zhong\u2019s heart tremble. After all Zheng Min gave birth to Murong Xin Lian for him and normally she is also very favored by Murong Tai. But now this matter happened, Murong Tai didn\u2019t even ask, directly killed her and didn\u2019t even leave a whole body. This prime minister was really heartless, ah\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The only one on the scene who was happy was Murong Qing Lian. Zheng Min died. Liu Yan Zhi could now be the only favored one. And Murong Xin Lian will be shamed because of this. No matter how beautiful she was, good families wouldn\u2019t dare to let her marry into their family!</p><br/><p>I tried to find the story I heard when I was younger, but couldn\u2019t find it. I was also curious about the story of the green hat and a family once told me a story.</p><br/><p>Long time ago, in the ancient times, there was a merchant who had a wife that sold vegetable on the market. One day, she and a man selling tofu got attracted to each other. When the merchant went away for business, they would have an affair. One time, the merchant went away to buy something and the man selling tofu thought he went again on a business trip. While they were having a tryst, the merchant came back home. The man selling tofu needed to hide. The wife then told the man selling tofu that when her husband goes on a business trip, she\u2019ll make him wear a green hat. The wife said to her husband that she would make him a green hat, so it\u2019ll be like she is with him when he was away. So since then every time the man selling tofu saw the merchant go away wearing a green hat, he\u2019ll think: I\u2019ll go warm your bed for you.</p><br/><p>1.

Hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t hear! Miss didn\u2019t say that!\u201d Su Mei and Su Yue quickly and cooperatively shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown princess, princess, did you hear?\u201d Murong Qi Qi looked at Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu. Although these two really wanted to help Mu Yu Die, but from beginning to end, Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t nod nor agree. The two could only shake their heads.</p><br/><p>At this point, Mu Yu Die\u2019s face turned green. What did she mean? Could it be that the words she\u2019d just said didn\u2019t mean that she was willing to share a husband? The meaning was so obvious, how come Murong Qi Qi was now going back on her words?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Mu Yu Die blurted out.</p><br/><p>Seeing Mu Yu Die acting so eager, Murong Qi Qi chuckled, \u201cMiss Mu doesn\u2019t understand what I mean? Our family\u2019s wangye2 will have me as his only woman. It would be like this before the wedding and it would be like this after the wedding. As for miss Mu\u2019s wishful thinking, listen well and let the meaning get in your head. If I had to agree to every woman who are eager to paste themselves on my family\u2019s wangye, then even this capital wouldn\u2019t be able to fit them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026,\u201d Mu Yu Die never expected that Murong Qi Qi would say such things so straightforwardly, so\u2026ugly to hear. This was simply humiliating her, humiliating her feelings for Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, it\u2019s not only you who loves wangye! You should at least respect my true feelings for wangye!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing those words, Murong Qi Qi acted like she\u2019d heard the biggest joke. Slowly, step by step, she walked towards Mu Yu Die. Looking at the firmness in her eyes on her pale face, Murong Qi Qi sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelplessly, the falling flower is yearning for love, but the heartless brook ripples on. Even if the love miss Mu has for our family\u2019s wangye is higher than the mountains and deeper than the seas, what does it matter? Feng Cang\u2019s heart only has me. It so happens that I am someone possessive and has possessed his full heart. Even a strand of your hair wouldn\u2019t be able to enter. You should be more conscious and let go! Don\u2019t be at such an age and still thinking so wishfully!\u201d</p><br/><p>The falling flower is yearning for love, but the heartless brook ripples on: one side is willing, yet the other one remains indifferent</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s poisonous tongue made Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu startle. She\u2019d completely disregarded Mu Yu Die\u2019s face and \u2018humiliated\u2019 her on the street like this. Could it be that Murong Qi Qi wasn\u2019t afraid of offending the prime minister? Besides, how could there be such a woman who repeatedly said that she\u2019d not let Feng Cang take concubines? Was this woman a jealous wife? Would Feng Cang agree with such an unreasonable request?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Mu Yu Die got angry. The thing she cared about the most was when people talked about her age. Now, Murong Qi Qi keeps saying \u2018at such an age\u2019. She was clearly bullying her.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, you went overboard! You take decisions according to your wishes like that, wangye may not agree!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026,\u201d Murong Qi Qi sneered and casted a glance at Mu Yu Die\u2019s black face. Her mouth went up a beautiful curve. \u201cWangye said inside Nan Lin wangfu, I\u2019m the boss! My decision also means wangye\u2019s decision!\u201d</p><br/><p>That Feng Cang pampered Murong Qi Qi this much was more than Yu Shi Shi and the others had expected. It seemed that the hope to push Mu Yu Die into Nan Lin wangfu would fall!</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi couldn\u2019t bear to see Murong Qi Qi\u2019s proud face. If in the past, she didn\u2019t take one step wrong, how would Murong Qi Qi act so domineering like this now? Why did such a good thing fall into Murong Qi Qi\u2019s hands? This Murong Qi Qi didn\u2019t have the appearance nor the body; why did Feng Cang happen to like such a woman? Truly incredible!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye is not bigger than the emperor! The emperor hasn\u2019t spoken about this matter, so this matter isn\u2019t certain yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>After being irritated by Murong Qi Qi, Mu Yu Die finally pulled Wanyan Lie out.</p><br/><p>So, it was like that! Murong Qi Qi finally understood. No wonder these three women would group together; no wonder Mu Yu Die dared to be so bold and confident. It seemed that old thing from Mu fu wanted to walk the road of Wanyan Lie. They wanted to use the emperor and get a decree to suppress her? Could it be that she, Murong Qi Qi, was a lamb waiting to be slaughtered?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we can talk about this after the emperor opens his golden mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>The arrogant face of Murong Qi Qi changed to a calm one. So calm, it was like the deep sea without any trace of waves. She looked at her beautiful fingers and gently touched the pink nails.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, miss Mu should be careful, ah! Two happy occasions at one home, but there are many cases where people didn\u2019t have the blessing to receive such a situation. Even if the emperor sent a decree, you should also have the blessing to receive it\u2026If by chance, the head accidentally fell, then it would be like miss Mu using a wicker basket to draw water! After all, sometimes, old women\u2019s heads would get short circuited and the reaction is not so agile. There are also cases of sudden deaths.\u201d</p><br/><p>Using a wicker basket to draw water: wasted efforts</p><br/><p>Just now, Mu Yu Die was at \u2018such an age\u2019. Now, she\u2019d become upgraded to \u2018old woman\u2019. No matter how good Mu Yu Die\u2019s temper was, she could hear the sarcasm and threats in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words. She (MQQ) was too daring!</p><br/><p>\u201cMurong Qi Qi! Are you threatening and intimidating me?! I\u2019m the granddaughter of an official of the first rank; who gave you the gut to treat me like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBenwang3 gave it\u2026,\u201d not waiting for Mu Yu Die to finish venting her anger, a cold voice came over. The next moment, Murong Qi Qi fell into a warm embrace. She didn\u2019t need to guess to know it\u2019s Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s appearance made the three women take half a step back. After his gaze swept over the three women once, Feng Cang lowered his head and gently kissed Murong Qi Qi\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you not bring more people when coming out?! What if you\u2019d encountered mad dogs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words directly categorized the three women as mad dogs. Su Mei and Su Yue covered their mouths and laughed in secret. Wangye\u2019s poisonous tongue\u2019s skills have become better, ah! The crazy look of Mu Yu Due just now, truly was like a mad dog!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, when encountering a mad dog, naturally one should kill and then strip it to warn the public\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s gaze fell on Mu Yu Die\u2019s face. Her eyes were full of smiles but they let Mu Yu Die feel a coldness. She immediately tightened her cloak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, is miss Mu dissatisfied with benwang\u2019s wangfei?\u201d4 </p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Feng Cang here, how could Mu Yu Die dare to be rude to Murong Qi Qi? Unless she was blind; otherwise, how could she not see the love in Feng Cang\u2019s eyes for Murong Qi Qi? In her heart, she felt so jealous, but she couldn\u2019t say anything! It seemed that she definitely needed to let grandfather go to the emperor. She also wanted Feng Cang to look at her with so much love in his eyes and be gentle like this towards her!</p><br/><p>After Feng Cang came, Yu Shi Shi\u2019s gaze immediately was full of hidden bitterness. Why did he only show such a gentle side to Murong Qi Qi? Why wouldn\u2019t he take one more look at her? Could it be he hates her for annulling the engagement in the past? It was just, she also didn\u2019t have a choice; she was forced, ah\u2026</p><br/><p>At this time, Yu Shi Shi\u2019s illness of being infatuated acted up again. She was clearly searching for trouble. Seeing Yu Shi Shi like this, Murong Qi Qi wanted to vomit. It seemed that none of these mad and disorderly butterflies were well behaved! It\u2019s time to let them eat some bitterness!</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, in fact, they did it for my own good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi put her small hand into Feng Cang\u2019s big palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were worried that I would have a short life and wouldn\u2019t live pass the wedding night. So, crown princess and princess tried their best to pair miss Mu and you. Just now, the three persuaded me and wanted to let me agree on letting miss Mu and I serve and marry you together! I heard that sir prime minister personally took your and miss Mu\u2019s eight characters to let someone calculate it. The result is that you two were a perfect match\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi say that, the three wanted to die on the spot.</p><br/><p>These were only some words that they\u2019d wanted to test Murong Qi Qi privately with. It was a bunch of nonsense. How could they\u2019ve expected that Murong Qi Qi would tell Feng Cang everything?! Didn\u2019t all women, when faced with such a situation, pretend to be generous and take the concubine for their husband? How could there be such a woman like Murong Qi Qi, who wanted to let the world know about this?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that prime minister is already old. It\u2019s time for him to retire and return back to his hometown to enjoy his later years\u2026\u201d Feng Cang narrowed his eyes and looked at Mu Yu Die. His body burst with coldness. \u201cThat being the case, benwang will add one more sentence on the memorial to the emperor, lest the emperor forget about this matter and also to avoid prime minister being confused and do something detrimental to the country.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Feng Cang\u2019s words reached Mu Yu Die\u2019s ears, she couldn\u2019t help but shudder. What did Feng Cang mean? Did he want to remove her grandfather from his position? How could this be?! Then won\u2019t her Mu clan\u2019s splendor and wealth come to an end?</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, this is not a bad idea! This way, crown prince\u2019s heart can be at ease. Crown princess niangniang5 is really a good helper, ah! The prime minister leaving his post is all niangniang\u2019s credit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words let a trace of appreciation flash in Feng Cang\u2019s eyes. This little wangfei knows how to sow dissension! Everyone knew that the prime minister supported second prince Wanyan Yi. If the prime minister retires, the second prince would lose a source of power. The one who would benefit then would be crown prince Wanyan Hong!</p><br/><p>Must say, the result of this trick from Murong Qi Qi was very obvious.</p><br/><p>Although Mu Yu Die tried to convince herself that Murong Qi Qi was sowing dissension, but the thought about how recently Yu Shi Shi had been encouraging her to marry Feng Cang and also telling her to let her grandfather go to the emperor; the meaning behind these actions were worth thinking about! Could it be that Yu Shi Shi came to find her because she wanted to consolidate crown prince\u2019s position?</p><br/><p>Everyone knew the emperor favored Feng Cang. If Feng Cang didn\u2019t agree, then Wanyan Lie would also not force Feng Cang to do things he didn\u2019t like. By chance, if the matter didn\u2019t go as they planned, then not only did they offend Feng Cang, maybe her grandfather would truly need to resign and return to their hometown. In the end, the one who would profit from all of these is definitely crown prince Wanyan Hong!</p><br/><p>After thinking about all of these, Mu Yu Die glared once at Yu Shi Shi. Seeing that her (YSS) eyes dodged her eyes, Mu Yu Die was even more sure about the truth in Murong Qi Qi\u2019s words. No wonder Yu Shi Shi recently came to look for her and pretended to be close to her.</p><br/><p>In the past, because of the awkward situation between the second prince and the crown prince, Yu Shi Shi always kept a distance from her. Now, she suddenly became so close to her; there\u2019s certainly a hidden motive! She actually fell into Yu Shi Shi\u2019s trap!</p><br/><p>This woman was truly hateful! She used her love for Feng Cang to shake their Mu fu! Feeling that she had been used, especially her love for Feng Cang had been used, Mu Yu Die wasn\u2019t able to accept it. The way she looked at Yu Shi Shi was not as amiable as before. It seemed that gaze held two knives.</p><br/><p>Obviously, in the past, Wanyan Bao Zhu was like her and liked Feng Cang till they hovered between life and death, but today she was unusually quiet. Instead, she went along with Yu Shi Shi. These two definitely planned to let her fall into a pit! She almost fell for it!</p><br/><p>Being slandered by Murong Qi Qi like this, Yu Shi Shi couldn\u2019t clear herself even if she had a hundred mouths. She just wanted to use Mu Yu Die to crack Murong Qi Qi. She didn\u2019t expect that Murong Qi Qi would excavate the deep meaning behind it. Besides, she didn\u2019t even think about that.</p><br/><p>Seeing that her words had caused some effects, Murong Qi Qi chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I just joked with you. Don\u2019t take it seriously?! Just now, crown princess niangniang, princess Bao Zhu and miss Mu were just joking with me! I just shared the jokes between our sisters with wangye, how could wangye take it seriously? Prime minister Mu is highly respected and a pillar of the country\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that pair of clever eyes on Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang\u2019s eyes no longer could tolerate another. Feng Cang already knew that Murong Qi Qi being like this meant that she had found a way to punish these women and didn\u2019t want him to help. Since his little wangfei is happy, then he should just watch the play! Anyway, no matter what she does, it would be alright since behind her, there\u2019s him!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Really?\u201d Feng Cang \u2018suddenly realized\u2019. \u201cQing Qing, in the future don\u2019t use such jokes to scare me. It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know; in my heart Qing Qing is more important than all existence. If Qing Qing is unhappy, I\u2019ll let everyone be unhappy. Come, let me coax Qing Qing till she\u2019s happy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In comparison, Feng Cang\u2019s words were truly a threat and also made these people dare not to say anything. Feng Cang said it like that, then it\u2019s certain that he would do it. It was just, Yu Shi Shi and the other didn\u2019t think that Murong Qi Qi was so important in Feng Cang\u2019s heart. If Murong Qi Qi is unhappy, then he would let everyone be unhappy? Feng Cang could absolutely do such a thing!</p><br/><p>Feng Cang cooperated so well and gave her so much face, making Murong Qi Qi become very happy. She\u2019d already wasted so much time on these three women. It\u2019s time to go to Jue Se Fang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, I want to go to Jue Se Fang to pick a few clothes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accompany you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving these three women behind, Feng Cang personally led Murong Qi Qi away. And Feng Cang\u2019s appearance made the people inside the gambling dens come out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see? That is princess Zhao Yang! This time, our contestant got into an accident, it\u2019s princess Zhao Yang who substituted them. That\u2019s why we won the tournament!\u201d</p><br/><p>Some people in the crowd introduced Murong Qi Qi\u2019s wonderful story. The people who originally wanted to see the outcome of the wedding, when they saw that Murong Qi Qi was such a well-behaved and pretty person, they felt pity for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe in a few days, she\u2019ll become a red skull!\u201d Someone whispered and sighed. However, this sentence reached Feng Cang\u2019s and Murong Qi Qi\u2019s ears. Feng Cang\u2019s hand tightened. Murong Qi Qi could feel the chillness coming from his hand.</p><br/><p>Seeing the attitude of Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi gave a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t believe those god-like rumors! In this world, there\u2019s no ghost; there\u2019s only people\u2019s hearts acting like ghosts! After living together these days, she could feel what kind of person Feng Cang truly was. If Feng Cang\u2019s life was really as strong as the rumors say, then why was it that after so long, she\u2019s still safe? It seemed that the only problem was the wedding night.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, it was Murong Qi Qi who led Feng Cang. She used action to tell those people who looked at her with pity that she is happy! And that she would continue to be happy like this!</p><br/><p>After Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi left, Mu Yu Die felt unsatisfactory. She put all of these on Yu Shi Shi. After saying a \u2018I\u2019ll take my leave\u2019, she left. Wanyan Bao Zhu also wanted to leave. Ever since she had intimate contact with Wanyan Hong, she consciously avoided the people of the East palace. However, today she was dragged out by Yu Shi Shi. Now, even if she wanted to leave, she feared that she wouldn\u2019t be able to.</p><br/><p>Being defeated by Murong Qi Qi, being hated by Mu Yu Die and now seeing Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi showing so much love, Yu Shi Shi felt that nothing went according to her plan today! Yu Shi Shi stared at Feng Cang\u2019s back. The vinegar pot in her heart had been knocked over.</p><br/><p>Look, see how other people\u2019s men love their women? And then thinking about that one in the East palace, aside from being a man, nothing about him is normal! How could Wanyan Hong be compared with Feng Cang? With what could he be compared to? Appearance? Personality? Ability? Temperament?</p><br/><p>Now, Yu Shi Shi felt that she was blind. In the past, because of being afraid, afraid that Feng Cang would die young; so in the end, she chose Wanyan Hong who may become the emperor. Now, what kind of days was she living? Only she knew.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d promised that person to certainly break up Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang, but now looking at the situation, this simply couldn\u2019t be done. What should she do?</p><br/><p>Now, Yu Shi Shi had anger, and she had nowhere to vent. She turned and saw Wanyan Bao Zhu who was in deep thoughts with her head lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial little sister, why didn\u2019t you say anything just now? In the past, didn\u2019t you hate Murong Qi Qi the most? You liked Nan Lin wang so much; why is it that after a trip to Yongzhou, you changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi\u2019s words made Wanyan Bao Zhu startled. Presumably because she had a guilty conscience; after hearing Yu Shi Shi\u2019s words, she felt like she had been seen through.</p><br/><p>Only after being in a daze for quite a moment, did Wanyan Bao Zhu recover. Since Wanyan Hong was unable to recognize her, Yu Shi Shi definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize her. Why should she scare herself like this?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seeing that Wanyan Bao Zhu didn\u2019t seem right, Yu Shi Shi chuckled. She showed a smile full of sarcasm. Just now, she (WBZ) gave a performance of having no interest in Feng Cang and now she was immersed in her own world. She\u2019s certainly thinking about Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>Ah, when had this girl learn to loosen the reins only to grasp them better? It was just, Feng Cang didn\u2019t put such a small trick into his eyes. Now, his heart must be filled with Murong Qi Qi\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Yu Shi Shi went forward and grabbed Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere to, imperial sister-in-law?\u201d Wanyan Bao Zhu raised her head and was met with Yu Shi Shi\u2019s pair of calculating eyes. Her heart was alarmed and beat hard like bells. She always felt that Yu Shi Shi, this crown princess, wasn\u2019t ordinary. She looked gentle and delicate but was in fact, very insidious. She\u2019s comparable with Wanyan Hong. No wonder they\u2019re husband and wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, to Jue Se Fang, ah! I want to go buy beautiful clothes! We need to go congratulate when Nan Lin wang gets married! If we\u2019re defeated by Murong Qi Qi in appearance, wouldn\u2019t it be very shameful?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Wanyan Bao Zhu to refuse, Yu Shi Shi pulled Wanyan Bao Zhu along in order to catch up with Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlies! So hateful!\u201d When Su Mei saw Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu following them from far away, she immediately humphed. People need to have face, trees have skins, why were these two so shameless? They actually followed them! She really didn\u2019t know how, with such tyrannical faces, they could still laugh!</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Mei, calm down!\u201d Murong Qi Qi patted Su Mei\u2019s hand. \u201cThe road is for people to walk on. We can\u2019t stop them!\u201d</p><br/><p>She guessed that Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu would follow them to Jue Se Fang, but she didn\u2019t stop them. She was still relying on them to do live advertisement for her. No one would make things difficult for money.</p><br/><p>After Fang Tong heard that miss had arrived, he immediately came out to greet. He hadn\u2019t walked to Murong Qi Qi yet, when he was stopped by Yu Shi Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cShopkeeper, what new things do you have recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tong knew Yu Shi Shi. She was the crown princess; the eldest imperial grandson\u2019s biological mother. Seeing that Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang continued to look around, Fang Tong knew that miss didn\u2019t need his service. He smiled and accompanied Yu Shi Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Isn\u2019t this crown princess niangniang? This commoner greets niangniang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just now, she lost face by Murong Qi Qi\u2019s actions. Now, she got it back from Fang Tong\u2019s respectful attitude, making her heart feel great satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm! I came today with princess Bao Zhu. We just want to look to see if there are any beautiful clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreeting to princess!\u201d Hearing that the one beside Yu Shi Shi was Wanyan Bao Zhu, Fang Tong immediately paid his respect.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may dispense yourself from curtsying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Wanyan Bao Zhu said one sentence, Fang Tong became startled. Then, he looked carefully at Wanyan Bao Zhu. At last, he smiled, \u201cGreat, wait here for a moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>When a beautiful blue dress was brought out and shown in front of Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu, the two\u2019s eyes almost fell out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful!\u201d Yu Shi Shi reached out and gently touched it. She felt the softness of the blue dress.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pretty!\u201d When Wanyan Bao Zhu once again opened her mouth, Fang Tong was certain that the person in front of him was Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>Fang Tong had a pair of preternaturally good ears. In the past, at Xi Qi, with just the word \u2018good\u2019 from Feng Cang, he was able to recognize that he was Nan Lin wang. Now, although Murong Xin Lian wore a human skin mask, but after two sentences, it was enough to let Fang Tong confirm the true identity of Murong Xin Lian.</p><br/><p>Why was Murong Xin Lian at Bei Zhou? Why was she dressed and appeared like Wanyan Bao Zhu? The fact that she looked like this now was definitely because she wore a human skin mask. It was just, what\u2019s her purpose for coming here (BZ)? Could it be to deal with miss?</p><br/><p>Thinking till here, Fang Tong concluded. He must tell Murong Qi Qi Wanyan Bao Zhu\u2019s true identity. He couldn\u2019t let his miss stay in the dark.</p><br/><p>Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu each chose a dress. Although the dresses here were very expensive, but they were unique. The thing women buy when spending money was vanity. To be able to wear a beautiful and unique dress in Bei Zhou and even unique in the four countries, becoming the focus of everyone, what importance did spending some money have?!</p><br/><p>Although Wanyan Hong\u2019s personality was bad and he was not so normal, but on materialistic things, he gave Yu Shi Shi great satisfaction. Don\u2019t know if it was because she wanted to prove to Feng Cang that she was living very well now or that she wanted to show her wealth, Yu Shi Shi also generously bought that dress of Wanyan Bao Zhu and gave it to her as a gift.</p><br/><p>\u201cA total of one thousand, two hundred silver teals!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are bank notes! Count them!\u201d Yu Shi Shi proudly took out a stack of bank notes and gave it to the servant. Her eyes swept over Murong Qi Qi as if she was saying, how do you feel? With one gesture, I can get a thousand teals! Did I scare you?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

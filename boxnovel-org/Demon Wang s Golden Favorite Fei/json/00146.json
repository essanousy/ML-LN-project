In this world, there\u2019s not a man who would refuse the tears of a weak woman. Men usually have a hero complex and want to show women their desire of protection. And a delicate face, along with pitiful tears, would most likely stimulate a man\u2019s desire to protect.</p><br/><p>Imperial grandmother trapped imperial grandfather like this. Empress mother also firmly held emperor father\u2019s heart in her hands like this. Her turn here, she also needed to capture Feng Cang\u2019s heart and have him swept off his feet for her.</p><br/><p>Not a while later, Wanyan Lie\u2019s decree reached Nan Lin wangfu.1 Hearing this news, Feng Cang frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever saw such a pestering girl!\u201d Ji Xia couldn\u2019t hold it in and complained out loud. That Xia Yun Xi had been refused by Feng Cang at White Cloud Restaurant had long spread throughout the capital, not to mention Nan Lin wangfu.</p><br/><p>Now, this woman had skipped a grade and directly went to Wanyan Lie to ask for a decree. How could this not make Feng Cang\u2019s people angry?</p><br/><p>No matter how the outside world talked about Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi being siblings, but a few of his confidantes knew Feng Cang\u2019s real identity. From the bottom of their hearts, they all took Murong Qi Qi as their wangfei.2 Now, a nuisance princess appeared and wanted to steal wangfei\u2019s position. Really unable to made heads or tails of it. Shameless!</p><br/><p>Naturally, Xia Yun Xi didn\u2019t know of Nan Lin wangfu\u2019s people\u2019s evaluation of her. She was cleaning up her things in high spirits and rushed to Nan Lin wangfu.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, please go this side!\u201d Housekeeper Feng Qi led Xia Yun Xi to Guanyu building. The Tingsong building, where Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi resided, was at the far east side. Guanyu building was at the far west side. If Xia Yun Xi wanted to see Feng Cang, she must walk around half of the wangfu. It would take more than an hour before she gets there. This was also deliberately arranged by Feng Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuanyu building! Very beautiful, bengong3 likes it very much!\u201d</p><br/><p>To be able to enter the wangfu was already the greatest news for Xia Yun Xi. She thought that after entering the wangfu, she would be together with Feng Cang. How would she know that this Guanyu building and Tingsong building were very far from each other? Now, she was just happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHousekeeper, where is the stove?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe stove? Is princess worried that wangfu\u2019s cook\u2019s dishes are not to your taste?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, bengong wants to personally make some delicious dishes for wangye!\u201d4 While saying this, Xia Yun Xi blushed. Her affecting shyness was like she was a bashful little girl.</p><br/><p>However, this shyness looked very hypocritical in Feng Qi\u2019s eyes. A genuinely reserved woman wouldn\u2019t have stalked a man like this. Now, what\u2019s only left was seducing the other party with the body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWangye has a cook only dedicated to him. He doesn\u2019t like the taste others make.\u201d Feng Qi mildly rejected Xia Yun Xi\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, can bengong learn how to make dishes from this cook? Bengong also wants to make a meal to wangye\u2019s taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s words made Feng Qi completely speechless. You didn\u2019t understand people\u2019s words or was it that you\u2019re thick-skinned, ah?!</p><br/><p>However, no matter how uncomfortable Feng Qi was in his heart, but after all, the other party was a princess. He, a housekeeper, couldn\u2019t brush the princess face, \u201cThis, you need to ask the cook. If princess wants a stove, I\u2019ll make the arrangements.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, housekeeper. Really troubling you!\u201d Xia Yun Xi\u2019s voice sounded delicate and gentle, making Feng Qi\u2019s whole body get goosebumps. Really didn\u2019t have to be so whiny. So nauseating!</p><br/><p>After Feng Qi left, Xia Yun Xi began to shout inside Guanyu building, \u201cHong Ye, I moved into Feng Cang\u2019s wangfu! I moved into Feng Cang\u2019s wangfu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, ah, princess. You will see wangye soon!\u201d Hong Ye was also happy for Xia Yun Xi. After all, for so many years, her heart only had Feng Cang. Now, she was able to fulfil her wish. This was a matter worthy of being happy for.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong Ye, take these silvers and go inquire about what Feng Cang likes; what his schedule is and when can I meet him? Where does he live and how to get there? Oh, you also need to ask clearly what Feng Cang likes to eat! Anyway, as long it\u2019s related to Feng Cang, I have to know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before coming, Xia Yun Xi had prepared many small amounts of silver. Her purpose was to buy people\u2019s hearts when she arrived at the wangfu. The Xia Yun Xi who grew up in the harem was deeply aware of the importance of winning people\u2019s hearts. When she becomes the master of wangfu, she wouldn\u2019t need to do this anymore. However, at this moment, using these small people was very necessary.</p><br/><p>In just one afternoon, Hong Ye gave away many silvers. With these silvers, Hong Ye gained a lot of valuable information in return.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis most loved person is princess Zhen Guo. He likes light tasting food the most and loves to eat chicken. His royal friend is fifth prince Wanyan Kang. His most favorite color is khaki color\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hong Ye spoke, Xia Yun Xi would write it all down. In the end, she recorded a full ten sheets of paper.</p><br/><p>Looking at the thick stack of papers which had a list of things about Feng Cang, Xia Yun Xi got a sense of satisfaction. She believed that if she acted according to this stack of paper, her sincerity would split open metal and rocks. One day, she would be able to move Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, the person wangye loves the most is princess Zhen Guo. If you let princess Zhen Guo be shamed at the palace banquet, will wangye\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Ye\u2019s words caused Xia Yun Xi to think. Before coming, she had heard many rumors about this pair of siblings.</p><br/><p>Originally, Murong Qi Qi was Xi Qi\u2019s princess who\u2019d come to form a marriage alliance. She was to become Feng Cang\u2019s bride, but in the end, she inexplicably became Feng Cang\u2019s little sister. Such a change of the relationship made the two people somewhat unable to stand it. That was reasonable.</p><br/><p>However, if Murong Qi Qi couldn\u2019t correct her attitude and still wanted to dip her finger into her biological big brother, then she (XYX) certainly wouldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, princess\u2026\u201d Seeing Xia Yun Xi remain silent and the viciousness flashing in her eyes, Hong Ye was startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as she doesn\u2019t block my road, everything could be talked out. If she blocks my road, I don\u2019t care who she is! Feng Cang\u2019s heart must only have me and can only love me alone! Those who are superfluous must be removed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s words revealed her rich possessiveness of Feng Cang. Hong Ye pitied Murong Qi Qi a bit. At least, according to her experience, those people who had been eyed by Xia Yun Xi, in the end all died very miserably. She hoped that this princess Zhen Guo could be more tactful and won\u2019t bring trouble for herself.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi\u2019s every move had already been reported to Feng Cang. When he had heard her last words, which had targeted Murong Qi Qi, the writing brush made of weasel bristles in Feng Cang\u2019s hand broke into two. Want to touch his people? She must be tired of living!</p><br/><p>Forced to let a woman in, Feng Cang was very unhappy. In this huge capital, the other person who was also unhappy because of this action was Wanyan Yi.</p><br/><p>From the moment he saw Xia Yun Xi at White Cloud Restaurant, her voice and smile had engraved deeply in Wanyan Yi\u2019s heart. He had seen many women, but those women weren\u2019t feminine. On Xia Yun Xi, Wanyan Yi saw his long-waited feminism. That smile, that knit of the brows, were like an Iris Tectorum in the wind, making people remember it in their hearts with just one glance.</p><br/><p>Now, Xia Yun Xi had moved into Nan Lin wangfu. This made Wanyan Yi\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but get tangled.</p><br/><p>He knew that Xia Yun Xi had come to Feng Cang as a candidate for marriage. She had come for Feng Cang. However, Wanyan Yi couldn\u2019t accept it. How could Feng Cang receive so much? He was obviously a hundred times more outstanding than Feng Cang!</p><br/><p>\u201cYi er,5 Yi er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside Jingxin hall, Lin Ke Xin chatted with her son, but she discovered that his mind had been wandering. Talking with him, but he didn\u2019t answer for half a day. He had a concerned look on his face, making her couldn\u2019t help but worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi er, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Lin Ke Xin\u2019s hand waved in front of Wanyan Yi\u2019s eyes. Only now did Wanyan Yi wake up.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort mother, this subject son is thinking about the matter of Dong Lu\u2019s princess. If Xia Yun Xi and Feng Cang become one, then doesn\u2019t it mean that Feng Cang would get Dong Lu\u2019s backing? This subject son doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s so good about Feng Cang!\u201d</p><br/><p>So, it was this thing. Lin Ke Xin laughed. \u201cTell consort mother the truth. Do you like Xia Yun Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>His thoughts being exposed by Lin Ke Xin, Wanyan Yi was a bit embarrassed. In the end, he still nodded. \u201cThis subject son fell in love with princess Yun at first sight. This subject son likes her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanyan Yi\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t fake. Lin Ke Xin was very sure that her son really liked Xia Yun Xi. She had also seen Xia Yun Xi once. From the viewpoint of men, Xia Yun Xi would indeed evoke man\u2019s desire to protect. However, letting her become the mother of the country; she (XYX) missed the calmness, missed being collected and was a bit small-minded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi er, consort mother doesn\u2019t object you liking princess Yun, but your empress must be Feng Qi Qi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort mother\u2026,\u201d Wanyan Yi knew that Lin Ke Xin said that for his own good. No matter how great Xia Yun Xi was, in Wanyan Lie\u2019s heart, she simply couldn\u2019t be compared to princess Zhen Guo. If he could get Murong Qi Qi, then his chance for getting the throne would be a lot higher. It was just, his heart already had Xia Yun Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>It was not that Lin Ke Xin didn\u2019t understand his hesitation. However, it was related to Wanyan Yi\u2019s throne. They couldn\u2019t become lax.</p><br/><p>\u201cAffection of a man and woman are lasting. Being a hero is brief. If you want to become a sovereign who goes down famously in history, you should put down love and focus on your great cause. Yi er, even if you can\u2019t give Xia Yun Xi the position of empress, you can give her supreme pampering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA woman\u2019s power is gotten by relying on the man\u2019s pampering. However, if you didn\u2019t have the ability to give her a happy life, then what do you have to love her?! When you become the emperor, the whole world is yours. Why should you then fear of not getting the beauty\u2019s heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Have to say, Lin Ke Xin knew very well how to use psychological tactics. Sure enough, after her explanation, Wanyan Yi put down his obsession with Xia Yun Xi. Indeed, as Lin Ke Xin had said, if he couldn\u2019t become the emperor, then he couldn\u2019t give Xia Yun Xi anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsort mother, princess Zhen Guo has moved into Long Autumn palace. What do you think she\u2019s thinking?\u201d After crossing this pit, Wanyan Yi regained his reasoning.</p><br/><p>The matter of vital importance was to overcome Feng Cang and become the heir to the throne. Wanyan Yi was very grateful for Lin Ke Xin\u2019s sharp warning that woke him up. The country, he wanted it. The beauty, he also wanted it. With the country, he could have any beauty. Without the country, his life is hard to guarantee, let alone protect his woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026wasn\u2019t it not wanting to take this opportunity to pull the distance closer with the emperor? Before, the emperor made her princess Zhen Guo and gave her Long Autumn palace; why didn\u2019t we see her move in then? Now, you and Feng Cang are fighting for the throne, she couldn\u2019t wait to move into the palace. Isn\u2019t this obviously getting votes for Feng Cang?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout the matter of the throne; see how Feng Cang didn\u2019t say anything and pretended like he was a gentleman. In fact, his heart had long been wanting this piece of meat. It was not convenient for him to come forward. He sent his little sister to come play the family card. Yi er, ah, the Feng siblings are way smarter than you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Ke Xin\u2019s words made Wanyan Yi prostate himself in admiration. In the end, she\u2019s indeed his consort mother. Every sentence hit the core. Feng Cang sent his little sister to the palace to get love from emperor father. This pair of sibling are too vicious, despicable and without any sense of shame!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, this is your chance. You can get a bit closer to Feng Qi Qi and create moments to let everyone think that there\u2019s something between you. When the time is right, the uncooked rice is cooked, even if Feng Qi Qi doesn\u2019t want, but others would think you\u2019re a couple. She also wouldn\u2019t be able to overturn these facts and could only follow you! After all\u2026the most important thing of a woman is chastity.\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying this, Lin Ke Xin exposed a wicked smile. Corresponding to her, Wanyan Yi also laughed darkly. Anyway, it\u2019s just a woman! Even if she\u2019s the number one beauty of the world, pressed under the body, she\u2019s also such a simple thing!</p><br/><p>No matter how hard the outsiders were calculating, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi were very calm.</p><br/><p>Xia Yun Xi had plotted actively to breathe the same air under the same sky as Feng Cang, but she didn\u2019t expect that this involved party was no longer in the wangfu. Instead, he\u2019d taken advantage of the night and sneaked into Long Autumn palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you came?\u201d Seeing Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi was very happy. Although her words were indifferent, but her body language betrayed her heart. Not waiting for Feng Cang to come in front of her, Murong Qi Qi directly jumped into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cI missed you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Cang\u2019s words were very simple. His actions were more direct. One hand was around Murong Qi Qi. The other hand held her chin. He looked carefully for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, the complexion is not bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you want me to be? To weep endlessly and waste my feelings because of Xia Yun Xi?\u201d Murong Qi Qi liked the clean taste from Feng Cang\u2019s body. The feeling in his arms was very good. So warm, so safe.</p><br/><p>Originally, it was already night, but Murong Qi Qi\u2019s heart felt like it missed something. She\u2019d delayed going to sleep. Only when Feng Cang came, did she realise that she\u2019d been waiting for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, originally I thought that after Qing Qing left me, Qing Qing would have no thought for tea or rice and would be restless at night. Now, seeing Qing Qing living so comfortable without me, really let people be sad. Ay, pity my heart for thinking of you, couldn\u2019t sleep and even jumped over the wall to sleep with you. However, you being like this makes my heart so sad\u2026Forget it, I better go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>No thought for tea or rice: have no appetite</p><br/><p>Feng Cang turned and wanted to leave, but was hugged from behind by Murong Qi Qi, \u201cNot allowed to leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing doesn\u2019t think of me, doesn\u2019t miss me and doesn\u2019t love me. What meaning does it have if I stay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time, Murong Qi Qi found out that this man had a great potential for acting. Presumably, in this world, only Feng Cang could act cute so naturally, boldly and self-confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it that I didn\u2019t miss you?! I was separated for just a day from you; my head, my heart are both full of your shadow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murong Qi Qi\u2019s soft love words spread from behind Feng Cang, making him laugh. He turned and lifted Murong Qi Qi, \u201cI also missed you, Qing Qing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the chamber, the light went out. Outside the chamber, a black shadow left and went to the imperial study.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Nan Lin wang entered princess Zhen Guo\u2019s chamber and didn\u2019t come out again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswering emperor, this underling waited for an hour. Feng Cang didn\u2019t leave\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before, the person in black didn\u2019t know why the emperor would let him keep watch outside of Long Autumn palace. Now, seeing such results, he somewhat understood. Nan Lin wang committing incest with his own little sister? This was truly too shocking! However, the master on the top didn\u2019t speak. The person in black also didn\u2019t open his mouth. He only reported to Wanyan Lie what he had seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Good!\u201d Wanyan Lie\u2019s mood was very good. Feng Cang didn\u2019t leave, this meant that between these two people, the canal was formed (the deed is done). This brat was not bad. He knew how to seize an opportunity! Ay, if in the past, he also had half of Feng Cang\u2019s courage, it would\u2019ve been great!</p><br/><p>Wanyan Lie\u2019s \u2018good\u2019 surprised the person in black. What\u2019s the matter with the emperor? Could it be that he had turned muddle-headed?! Siblings committing incest and the emperor actually said good? What\u2019s Wanyan Lie\u2019s meaning, ah?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can retreat! Right, the next few nights, you should continue to keep watch outside of princess Zhen Guo\u2019s palace. Record what time Feng Cang enters and what time he leaves. Right, don\u2019t let him discover! Go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, the person in black was completely confused. What\u2019s the reason behind the emperor doing this? Could it be that he wanted to go catch them in the act? Could it be that emperor\u2019s favorite candidate for the crown prince\u2019s position wasn\u2019t Feng Cang? That\u2019s why he wanted to seize the scandal of the siblings and make a matter out of it?</p><br/><p>Although countless thoughts caused an impact in his brain, but the person in black was well trained. He didn\u2019t say any unnecessary words. Wanyan Lie\u2019s words were a decree. He should just comply. After leaving the imperial study, the person in black continued to squat at Long Autumn palace, just outside Murong Qi Qi\u2019s chamber.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, Cang, that fly has returned again! Whose people do you think he is?!\u201d Murong Qi Qi lay next to Feng Cang. From the moment the person in black had appeared, she knew. She just didn\u2019t say anything. Just now, she\u2019d thought he had left. She didn\u2019t expect that he would return again. So hateful, ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe secret guards of this palace are naturally the emperor\u2019s people\u2026\u201d His mouth was answering Murong Qi Qi, but Feng Cang\u2019s hand began to act dishonest\u2026</p><br/><p>1.

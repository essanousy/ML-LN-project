Her gaze was on elder Teng Yuan\u2019s face. Because she had a side of her face towards him, the tattoo on her left face glowed mysteriously under the light. Elder Teng Yuan smiled, reached out and wanted to touch the hook on Taji Guli\u2019s left hand, but he was dodged by Taji Guli.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to see if this iron hook was suitable!\u201d Elder Teng Yuan\u2019s wrinkled face smiled like a blooming chrysanthemum. \u201cI\u2019m really a genius! I gave you such a good weapon! Girl, you should thank me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The iron hook on Taji Guli\u2019s left hand was designed by elder Teng Yuan after she came to White Bird mountain and met him. Although, Taji Guli felt that it was a bit uncomfortable with such a thing on her left hand, but it was better than an empty broken hand. Especially after she tried the power of the iron hook, she had become more and more skillful at using it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want me to truly thank you, then help us. By then, we will give you whatever you want!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the moment Taji Guli opened her mouth, she will mention their pact, elder Teng Yuan leaned on the pillow and put more tobacco in the pipe.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! I know what you all are saying! Isn\u2019t it just about that I shouldn\u2019t agree on curing the gu?! Rest assured, leave it to me. Even if Gu De is the chief, we, these elders also have the right to vote. If I don\u2019t agree, this matter won\u2019t go so easily! Not to mention how difficult the three tests are! Even a high-skilled person would be guaranteed to be gone forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuang\u2026\u2019 Taji Guli\u2019s hook nailed in the wooden table in front of elder Teng Yuan. The sudden murderous aura scared him so much that the tobacco pouch in his hand almost loosened. He looked again and saw that Taji Guli was looking at him full of anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many times have I told you that Feng Cang is my man! I absolutely won\u2019t allow anyone to touch him! Did you hear clearly?!\u201d</p><br/><p>That overbearing tone matched with Taji Guli\u2019s ferocious looking face caused elder Teng Yuan\u2019s brow to quiver for two to three seconds. Then, he laughed, \u201cA man who needs the protection of a woman is still a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>This statement undoubtedly ignited the fire in Taji Guli\u2019s heart. How could she accept the other party talking like this about Feng Cang?! In Taji Guli\u2019s Feng Cang was a perfect incarnation. Even if the person in front of her was Qiang tribe\u2019s elder, but he couldn\u2019t even be compared to a small finger of Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Cang is not such a man! He\u2019s a hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Elder Teng Yuan lengthened his tone. His voice was full of mockery, \u201cThen, you are imagining that your love is reciprocated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when elder Teng Yuan was happy that he found the answer, Taji Guli\u2019s hook caught his collar and brought this thin and old man to her face. \u201cTry say that once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Teng Yuan was right, but it was precisely because he pointed out Taji Guli\u2019s heart that let her fly into rage out of humiliation. She didn\u2019t like people seeing through her inner thoughts. Feng Cang had become her hero for many years. She admits that she likes him, but when these words were spoken out by elder Teng Yuan, it changed taste. It was like she was a woman who couldn\u2019t be brought out in the open. She didn\u2019t want that!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get angry. Don\u2019t get angry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Teng Yuan hadn\u2019t been scared. Instead, he put his mouth on the pipe and inhaled two times. \u201cComfortable! So comfortable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you continue to say nonsense, I will make it so that you can never be comfortable again!\u201d The calmer the other party was, the angrier Taji Guli got. These two people; one was like water and one was like fire that couldn\u2019t mix together and be at a state of mutual hostility.</p><br/><p>Seeing Taji Guli like this, Duyi put away the box with the cream and pulled Taji Guli to a side.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, she\u2019s hot-tempered like this. Forgive her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never haggle with a woman! Women are to be pampered and loved! However\u2026\u201d Elder Teng Yuan swept once over Taji Guli. \u201cI like the gentle and kind-hearted women of our Qiang tribe better. I don\u2019t like such a tigress!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did you say is a tigress?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taji Guli stood up. She had been forced to hide here for many days. The anger in her heart was already like a thriving volcano and waiting to explode. Now elder Teng Yuan said these words was clearly looking for trouble.</p><br/><p>Elder Teng Yuan smiled at Taji Guli\u2019s temper. His mouth made \u2018cheche\u2019 sounds. Then, a worm crawled out from his right ear. This was a fat worm with a pair of small wings on its back. Compared with its fat body, these pair of wings were a bit comical. It was just, after the three people on the scene saw the worm, they couldn\u2019t laugh. Especially Taji Guli. She tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Gu, don\u2019t be afraid! This sister\u2019s temper is just a bit cranky. Don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Teng Yuan reached out to let the worm crawl on his hand. This worm was blue as the sky. The wings were lovely pink.</p><br/><p>\u201cI raised my ah Gu for forty-three years. Look, don\u2019t you think he\u2019s very cute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Teng Yuan looked smilingly at the three people in front of him. Especially when he looked at Taji Guli, his gaze paused for a long time. \u201cGood ah Gu, meet father\u2019s new friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>That gu worm seemed like it could understand elder Teng Yuan. It flashed its wings and flew to Duyi.</p><br/><p>For a moment, Duyi held his breath.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look down on this worm because it looked cute and seemed like fun to play with. It is a real gu worm. Especially when Duyi heard that this worm was raised by elder Teng Yuan for forty-three years, the way he looked at the worm changed. Forty-three years, it had almost become perfect!</p><br/><p>If it was somewhere else, Duyi would\u2019ve certainly picked up such a special worm and studied it. However, here is White Bird mountain and the Qiang tribe\u2019s territory. Here, any worm could be a gu. It could be that you didn\u2019t even know that you already got the gu. So, it\u2019s natural to stay as far away as possible!</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, Guli was just joking with you!\u201d Duyi smiled but his expression was very stiff. He was afraid that this gu would fell on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJoking? I know, I didn\u2019t haggle with the little girl! I only wanted to let you meet my baby ah Gu\u2026\u201d Elder Teng Yuan continued to smoke on the pipe. His eyes were closed. He had an expression that he was enjoying it very much.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, old man, if you\u2019re unhappy, then come at me! Why use a worm to dress up as god and play the devil?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dress up as god and play the devil: to mystify/ play tricks</p><br/><p>Taji Guli didn\u2019t like elder Teng Yuan from the very beginning. She felt that this person was too \u2018insidious\u2019 and didn\u2019t look like an honest person. Now, seeing that he took out his gu, Taji Guli felt more disgusted. She hated being threatened the most; especially by a worm!</p><br/><p>\u201cGuli, shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the leader of the three, Longze Jing Tian issued an order at the most critical moment. He stood up and cupped his fists at elder Teng Yuan to apologize, \u201cJust now, it was our fault. Asking elder to please pardon us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although, it had been a while since they met elder Teng Yuan, but Longze Jing Tian still couldn\u2019t see through this elder. He\u2019s the most prestigious elder of the Qiang tribe, but he doesn\u2019t do things according to common sense. Sometimes he was honest, sometimes he was evil. He was crazy and somewhat insane.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because of this character that Longze Jing Tian boldly put all his hopes on elder Teng Yuan. He didn\u2019t want much. He only wanted to get Feng Qi Qi. Of course, it would be better if they could kill Feng Cang.</p><br/><p>It was just, Taji Guli couldn\u2019t bear to see Feng Cang in trouble. So, they reached an agreement. He will get Feng Qi Qi; Taji Guli will get Feng Cang. As for Duyi, Longze Jing Tian promised him that after he (LJT) had killed Ming Yue Cheng and restored Xi Qi, he will give Duyi the position of the highest teacher of the state.</p><br/><p>Longze Jing Tian had always believed that there were no permanent enemies in this world. There were only eternal interests. For example, the three of them. They were originally people who would\u2019ve never crossed paths with each other, but for a common interest, they aligned together. Before reaching the goal, the three of them were a small group. If any side encountered a problem, the two other parties must use every effort to remedy the situation. This was where the significance of the alliance lies.</p><br/><p>The politeness of Longze Jing Tian was a stark contrast to Taji Guli. Elder Teng Yuan nodded and smoked twice again. He made two \u2018cheche\u2019 sounds. The fat worm flew back and stopped at elder Teng Yuan\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing elder Teng Yuan, the worm made two \u2018googoo\u2019 sounds and went into his earholes. The whole process was horrifying. Taji Guli almost vomited. She had never seen such a disgusting worm and such a nauseating way.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t because Longze Jing Tian said that this was their last resort, Taji Guli would\u2019ve never lived in such a sick place. She grew up on the prairie. When had she seen so many worms? Ever since she stayed at White Bird mountain, Taji Guli had seen a variety of worms. Whether it was the flying or crawling worms, all made her feel sick. Not to mention that these worms could be the terrifying gu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026,\u201d Seeing that Taji Guli didn\u2019t like here, elder Teng Yuan just chuckled. After he smoked a bag of tobacco, carefully cleaned the residue of the tobacco and knocked the ashes from the pipe, he finally put away the tobacco contentedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want Feng Cang to die, but he had decided to go through the three tests to save his son. By then, even if you couldn\u2019t bear to see something happen to the person you love, I\u2019m afraid that it wouldn\u2019t go as your wishes. Not to mention the mountains of daggers and the sea of flames, even if he is lucky and could survive till the end, the dragon pool is not somewhere anyone can enter. In this century, there had only been three people of our tribe who had passed these three tests successfully. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he mentioned that he had passed the mountains of daggers, seas of flames and the dragon pool, elder Teng Yuan\u2019s eyes obviously showed pride. Because he had passed these three tests, he was able to become the elder of Qiang tribe and became the person people admired. Even the new chief Gu De failed to pass the three tests smoothly!</p><br/><p>Taji Guli didn\u2019t know what these three tests are, but when she heard that these three tests would be unfavorable to Feng Cang, she was a bit anxious. \u201cIs there any way to resolve t? Nothing should happen to Feng Cang! Absolutely not!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, didn\u2019t you just say that he wasn\u2019t a man who needed the protection of a woman?! Since it was like that, then let him get through them himself! Life and death are ruled by fate; riches and honor are decided by heaven! If you want to achieve something without paying an equal price, how could you get what you want?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

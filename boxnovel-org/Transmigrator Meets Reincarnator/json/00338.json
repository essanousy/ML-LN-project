When she followed He Sanlang\u2019s line of sight, the crude naughty book that she had casually thrown onto the side table came into view.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blinked as curiosity welled up inside her.</p><br/><p>He Changdi normally seemed like a cool and aloof type of guy. She had never seen him smiling openly even in front of Matriarch He. Would a man as icy and reserved as He Sanlang really read that kind of book?</p><br/><p>Of course, Chu Lian didn\u2019t intend to judge him. He was a man after all and it was pretty common for them to watch a few \u2018movies\u2019 here and there. In the modern world, they might even have an entire hard disk\u2019s worth of \u2018movies\u2019 featuring their idols!</p><br/><p>She was simply curious. Chu Lian was definitely not going to admit that this was one of her stranger interests.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s body stiffened slightly. He shifted his gaze away from that blue leather-bound book forcefully. He then stood up abruptly and walked over to Chu Lian\u2019s other side before sitting down again.</p><br/><p>With his height and the armour he was wearing, as long as he bent his body forward slightly, he could block Chu Lian\u2019s view of that blue book on the table.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked at him strangely, \u201cWhy did you shift to the other side so suddenly?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi cast a quick glance over and met Chu Lian\u2019s perplexed gaze. It was only then that he pretended to be calm and collected as he replied, \u201cI\u2019m more used to sitting on this side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian muttered to herself, \u201cWhat a weird habit. Aren\u2019t you still sitting on the same bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>When He Sanlang saw that Chu Lian hadn\u2019t mentioned the little blue book at all, he heaved a sigh of relief inwardly. However, since he was leaning his body a little sideways, his current pose seemed rather strange.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hadn\u2019t realised why He Sanlang had moved at first. It was only when she turned her gaze in the direction of the side table that she realised what had happened.</p><br/><p>Her first reaction was to burst out into laughter within her mind. This lunatic husband of hers was trying to bury his head in the sand and ignore the book?</p><br/><p>He Sanlang hadn\u2019t even fully relaxed when Chu Lian\u2019s uniquely soft tone rang out, \u201cSo you like looking at lewd drawings?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s cool and handsome face instantly exploded into a furious blush that covered his entire face. His skin was the type that tended towards lighter tones, so the flush of red was extremely obvious.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian watched the changes on He Sanlang\u2019s face in surprise. She finally understood what the phrase \u2018ripe as a peach\u2019 meant.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s deep and serious eyes were now filled with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>His lips were pressed so tightly together that they formed a thin line. His face got redder and redder. After a moment of struggle, he managed to spit out a single sentence, \u201cThat book\u2019s not mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was already rolling on the floor in laughter within her mind. She was holding on to the last vestiges of her calm facade with all her might. She hadn\u2019t expected He Changdi to be so cute when embarrassed, so she hadn\u2019t been able to hold back her impulse to tease him just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found that book under your bed, so who else could it belong to? Who would put a book like that under someone else\u2019s bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>He just knew that this would happen! It was in this wicked woman\u2019s nature to be utterly infuriating!</p><br/><p>He had clearly been telling the truth, yet she refused to believe a single word of it.</p><br/><p>Frustration built up within He Sanlang\u2019s chest. However, there was no way for him to let it out. His current expression was extremely entertaining.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian just couldn\u2019t resist throwing in another jab, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any women in most military camps, so it\u2019s normal to look at these kinds of books. But there\u2019s nothing much to this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were just some normal positions shown in that book. They didn\u2019t even change the backgrounds of the drawings; it was too primitive.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Chu Lian\u2019s statement, a dangerous glint started shining in He Changdi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you looked inside?\u201d He abruptly cut in with a sinister-sounding tone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

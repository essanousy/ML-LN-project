He missed his father just as much as anyone else in the family, but he knew that it was his own fault that his father was coldly ignoring him now.</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an finally cast his gaze upon his disappointing eldest son. Fury and frustration warred within him and he ordered in a deep voice, \u201cFollow me to the study.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changqi stood up and followed the count out of Qingxi Hall with his head bowed.</p><br/><p>Now that the count had returned, the entire estate was bursting with joy.</p><br/><p>The news quickly spread to Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s courtyard. The countess disregarded her ailing health and immediately tried to get out of bed to see the husband she hadn\u2019t laid eyes upon for years.</p><br/><p>Luckily, He Changdi and Chu Lian arrived just in time to stop her, otherwise the countess might have made her condition worse.</p><br/><p>The entire family gathered in the parlour in the outer court to have a reunion dinner at night.</p><br/><p>Even He Erlang returned to the estate early this day.</p><br/><p>The estate was bustling with noise and excitement, and it was even livelier that it was on New Year\u2019s Day. The dishes served for dinner were personally cooked by Chu Lian and her handmaids.</p><br/><p>There was fragrant stir-fried pork, spicy stir-fried beef, griddle shredded cabbage, poached fish slices, old duck soup\u2026 There were more than ten dishes in total and they were all things that Count Jing\u2019an had never eaten before.</p><br/><p>After the meal, he couldn\u2019t help but compliment his youngest daughter-in-law\u2019s cooking.</p><br/><p>Since his belly was now full with an extremely satisfying reunion dinner, Count Jing\u2019an\u2019s mood had become much better as compared to in the day, when he was dealing with the mess that Dalang had created.</p><br/><p>That night, Count Jing\u2019an led his two little granddaughters and his wife back to their courtyard.</p><br/><p>Within the main bedroom of Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s courtyard, the servants had already retreated, leaving the couple to themselves. Their two granddaughters had been taken to bed by their nursemaids.</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an took his wife\u2019s hand and led her to sit by the desk. The couple was very close and they hadn\u2019t met in many years, so they were full of longing. Right now, the two of them had much to say to each other.</p><br/><p>The count was the most concerned about his wife\u2019s health.</p><br/><p>Although he had already received He Changdi\u2019s letter, stating that his wife\u2019s illness had been cured, he couldn\u2019t rest easy without seeing it for himself.</p><br/><p>Now that his previously bedridden and sickly wife was standing before him with healthy, ruddy cheeks, he was elated beyond belief.</p><br/><p>The burly middle-aged general\u2019s eyes reddened and he gripped his wife\u2019s hand, \u201cPeiwen, you\u2019re finally all better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an, Liu Peiwen, smiled along with her husband, \u201cYes, I\u2019m all better now. Those days when I was trapped in bed feel like a dream now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me how the person who healed you is like. Great Doctor Miao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an knew roughly how his wife had been cured, but he wasn\u2019t clear on the details involved.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an knew that he would ask about it, so she explained the entire situation from start to end patiently.</p><br/><p>It took her a whole hour to finish explaining it all. She smiled as she looked at her husband, \u201cIt must be the heavens who couldn\u2019t bear seeing me lying in bed and helped to cure me earlier so I could welcome you back to our home!\u201d</p><br/><p>The count chuckled and nodded. He lamented, \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife is really our He Family\u2019s lucky star. If not for her, Great Doctor Miao wouldn\u2019t have stayed in our estate so readily and helped to cure your illness. Although Mother is getting old and becoming more muddle-headed, she must have been guided by a greater power when she went to plead for this marriage for Sanlang. I\u2019ll go thank Great Doctor Miao myself tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an nodded in agreement, \u201cYes, we should thank him personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after, she seemed to have thought of something as she let out a giggle, \u201cHusband, now that you mention it, Sanlang has been growing more and more ever since his wife married into our family. He\u2019s a marquis now! Could Sanlang\u2019s wife be a lucky star for her husband as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an burst out into laughter and reminded his wife, \u201cRemember not to mention this out of our rooms, let\u2019s just keep it as a joke between us. This kind of talk can\u2019t be spread outside, or it might draw disaster upon us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that the count had returned, Countess Jing\u2019an had found her pillar of support once again. Her mind was now clearer than before. She hurriedly replied, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two drank their tea together. When the count noticed that his wife was looking at him as if she had something she didn\u2019t quite dare to say, he had a good guess at what she was keeping in. He sighed softly, \u201cDalang is an honest and considerate child to the bone and he\u2019s loyal to the family. It\u2019s not completely his fault that his marriage with Madam Zou turned out this way. The two of them have already divorced now, so don\u2019t think too much about it. We have to take each day as it comes. As for He Ying\u2019s child, don\u2019t worry. As long as I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll never approve of their marriage. Even if Dalang were to marry again, his second wife has to be a good and kindly lady. Otherwise, Little An and Little Lin will be the ones who\u2019ll suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Liu hadn\u2019t expected her husband to have made a clear decision on the matter. A burden was lifted from her heart.</p><br/><p>She leaned against her husband\u2019s side as the tightly wound nerves in her heart relaxed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

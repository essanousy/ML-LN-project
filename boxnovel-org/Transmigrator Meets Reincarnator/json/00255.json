All these important events had been squeezed together for some reason. It was going to be Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s birthday right after the autumn examinations ended, so the results of the autumn examinations would likely be posted on that day. However, since House Jing\u2019an was a military official family and none of their family members had taken part in the examinations, they wouldn\u2019t need to bother with the results. They would most likely hear about the top three scholars later and discuss it for a moment before forgetting about it.</p><br/><p>However, Chu Lian knew that the top scholar for the autumn examinations was going to be Xiao Bojian, the original male lead of the story. That scheming and ambitious man was going to use this result to transform himself and secure a seat at court.</p><br/><p>As much as Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to see that happen, she had no way to stop it either. There was a limit to her ability, and Xiao Bojian had a mysterious power backing him. She hadn\u2019t finished reading the book. Up to where she had stopped, the author had only mentioned that Xiao Bojian had a powerful force backing him, but hadn\u2019t revealed more details about it.</p><br/><p>As her thoughts led up to here, Chu Lian wanted to smash her bed out of regret and frustration. Why hadn\u2019t she read the ending first before starting the book!</p><br/><p>Her half-baked knowledge of the events of the book was now making her uneasy. She didn\u2019t know what Xiao Bojian was going to do later on.</p><br/><p>However, since she didn\u2019t know what was going to happen, she could only take it one step at a time. At least she still had a general understanding of the events of the near future, so she didn\u2019t have to worry too much for now.</p><br/><p>The day before Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s birthday.</p><br/><p>It was coming close to winter in the capital. Cold winds blew past like knives gliding across people\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>The north wind was blowing in the courtyard, but the bedroom in Qingxi Hall was as warm as spring thanks to the underground heating.</p><br/><p>By this time, Matriarch He had already woken up and was in the midst of having breakfast. While drinking some warm tea, she chatted with Senior Servant Liu and Muxiang.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu was squatting down and massaging Matriarch He\u2019s legs. \u201cMatriarch, you should have seen how sweet Third Young Master and Third Young Madam are with each other. Third Young Master wrote a letter this thick for Third Young Madam!\u201d After saying so, she even held up two fingers to illustrate her point. \u201cThis old servant was just sitting next to Third Young Madam and watching her read the letter. Third Young Madam read through that letter at least seven times over!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, this Sanlang. He\u2019s finally realising how good his wife is after leaving for the north. That\u2019s fine, the two of them are still young. Once Sanlang remembers this suffering, the two of them will be even closer after he comes back.\u201d Matriarch He had still been a little unwell over the past few days. However, after receiving a letter from her youngest grandson yesterday, her spirit had returned, along with her smiles. She looked both cheerful and energetic today, and her pallor seemed to have improved.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu knew that Matriarch He was the most worried about He Changdi out of her grandsons, so she took the chance to try to cheer Matriarch He up with some news.</p><br/><p>What else could make Matriarch He happy other than good news about the youngest couple of their family?</p><br/><p>When Madam Zou arrived at the entrance of the bedroom with her daughters in hand, she heard the sounds of laughter from within.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou frowned; in this month, she had actually slimmed down quite a bit. Her originally slightly plump cheeks were now sunken in on her face, making her look much older than she actually was.</p><br/><p>She gritted her teeth with a spark of unhappiness in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Her mother-in-law\u2019s birthday was almost here and she was the one who had to take care of all the matters related to it as the lady-in-charge of the household. She was so busy that she barely had any time to rest. It was already bad enough that the matriarch wasn\u2019t helping her, but look at what was happening in her courtyard. They were laughing so loudly like they had forgotten their manners.</p><br/><p>Little An and Little Lin trembled in their mother\u2019s grip. Their expressions seemed a little strained, as if they could sense their mother\u2019s unhappiness.</p><br/><p>The maidservant watching the door helped Madam Zou lift the curtains covering the entrance and Madam Zou led her two little ones into the warm room.</p><br/><p>When they caught sight of the affable Matriarch He, Little An and Little Lin immediately broke free from their mother\u2019s hands and ran towards the matriarch.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He chuckled and lifted the two children to sit on either side of her. She then patted their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle An and Little Lin have come! Was it cold outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little An tugged at her little sister\u2019s hand and secretly glanced at Madam Zou before shaking her head obediently, \u201cLittle An isn\u2019t cold at all. Little An wanted to come and see Great-Grandmother earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAy, my Little An\u2019s the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He quickly carried the six-year-old Little An and hugged her.</p><br/><p>Since the matriarch\u2019s health had just recovered, Senior Servant Liu was afraid that the weight of Little An might hurt the matriarch\u2019s body. She quickly shot a look at the two nursemaids standing by and the two nursemaids hurried forward to carry the children away to play.</p><br/><p>It was only after Madam Zou had finished watching Matriarch He bonding with her two children that she stepped forward to greet the matriarch. \u201cGranddaughter-in-Law greets Grandmother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He waved away the formality and instructed her granddaughter-in-law to take a seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting colder outside now. Little An and Little Lin are still young and they\u2019re just little girls. Their bodies are frail, so you don\u2019t have to bring them to greet me every day. Let the two children sleep a little more.\u201d</p><br/><p>These were just Matriarch He\u2019s way of caring for her great-granddaughters, but it seemed to hold a different meaning in Madam Zou\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Her expression stiffened and she replied, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be good, Grandmother. Although they\u2019re young, they\u2019re still your legitimate great-granddaughters. Greeting you in the morning is part of their duties.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

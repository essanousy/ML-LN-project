It was clear he hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock earlier. Although his figure was as large and burly as before, he seemed more like a lone and lost bear right now. The layer of stubble on his chin added to his fragile appearance.</p><br/><p>The grating sound of Eldest Madam He Ying\u2019s sobs was ringing in everyone\u2019s ears now.</p><br/><p>Ever since she had discovered what had happened to He Dalang and Miss Pan, He Ying had been wailing her complaints in the parlour.</p><br/><p>She was acting like a crazy woman, unbefitting of a noble, causing everyone in the estate to look down on her even more.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He had been awakened in the middle of the night, so her expression wasn\u2019t looking too good. When she heard that something had happened to her granddaughter, she almost fainted right over.</p><br/><p>Following that, her ears had been filled with the incessant cries of He Ying, turning her Qingxi Hall into a noisy vegetable market.</p><br/><p>Even the servants couldn\u2019t bear to look.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an was helped into the parlour by Senior Servant Wang. Her face was as pale as a sheet, alarming Chu Lian, who hurriedly went up to support her other side.</p><br/><p>When Matriarch He saw that Countess Jing\u2019an had arrived, she finally had someone to vent all the fire in her belly on. She slapped the table and roared furiously, \u201cLook at the son you\u2019ve birthed! That monster ruined his very own cousin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an almost collapsed to the floor thanks to the matriarch\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Luckily, there were two people supporting her on either side, or she might have fainted out of anger.</p><br/><p>The normally mild-mannered countess pointed at He Dalang with a trembling finger. Her voice was hoarse with pain as she ordered, \u201cYou unfilial son! Kneel down right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Dalang\u2019s eyes were still empty. Upon hearing his mother\u2019s order, he didn\u2019t give out any sound of protest. He simply knelt down in the center of the parlour. His originally straight back was bent over, causing a pang of heartache in those who cared for him.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shot a look at Senior Servant Wang, and they worked in unison to help Countess Jing\u2019an over to a nearby chair.</p><br/><p>He Ying kneeled down on the ground and grabbed onto the matriarch\u2019s legs. She wailed, \u201cMother! You have to do something for Miss Zhen! My poor, innocent daughter! I was still looking for a good marriage for her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen had been taken back to Qingxi Hall by now. She was resting in one of the side rooms near the parlour, with Senior Servant Liu and a few maidservants taking care of her.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t stopped crying ever since she had returned to Qingxi Hall, no matter how Senior Servant Liu and the maidservants tried to comfort her. Her eyes were already swollen to the size of walnuts. It was clear that she was feeling regret over her actions.</p><br/><p>Doubts arose in Senior Servant Liu\u2019s heart upon seeing Pan Nianzhen\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>She kept a watchful eye on the maidservants by Pan Nianzhen\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Over in the parlour, He Ying\u2019s plea for help had only darkened the storm on Matriarch He\u2019s face. Although she still felt guilt over her treatment of her daughter, the current situation was like a slap in her face. Thus, she finally spoke harshly towards her daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, why didn\u2019t you take proper care of Miss Zhen! Why would she be in the outer court at such a late hour!\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch still had her moments of clear wit. She could see that something was wrong with the situation.</p><br/><p>Even though this dynasty was more open-minded, there was an unspoken curfew at night for the ladies. Once the skies turned dark and they finished their dinners, noble ladies would stay in their own rooms. They wouldn\u2019t leave their own courtyards, let alone the estate.</p><br/><p>Last night, the three He brothers had returned at a very late hour. Why had Pan Nianzhen appeared in the main study of the outer court at that time?</p><br/><p>The answer to this question would determine whether He Dalang was a victim or a culprit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

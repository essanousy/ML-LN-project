He harrumphed and continued forming the plan in his mind.</p><br/><p>By the time He Changdi woke up, it was already morning of the next day.</p><br/><p>Even though Su City was close to Liangzhou City, their climates were completely different. While it was still snowing heavily in Liangzhou, the residents of Su City were able to experience the occasional warm winter morning day.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Hongyu and Zhang Mai walked out of their tent after a nice long night of rest, they had the feeling of having walked out of a prison and into the sunlight once again.</p><br/><p>Having gotten used to the bone-piercing cold winds and harsh snow of Liangzhou, the two men felt a little uncomfortable when they were only met with warm and gentle sunshine on their faces.</p><br/><p>After they moved into He Changdi\u2019s tent, Xiao Hongyu started joking around. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Brother He? Why are you in such a rush to go shopping in Su City? Are you looking to buy some of their specialties for Sister-in-Law?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai smiled upon hearing Xiao Hongyu\u2019s teasing.</p><br/><p>However, He Changdi didn\u2019t show any reaction to the joke. Instead, his expression turned even more grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhang, Hongyu, I have something I have to discuss with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two bright and sunny days passed in Su City before another wave of cold wind and snow came by. The city that had managed to thaw for a little while was once again engulfed by a snowstorm.</p><br/><p>Right now, there were only a few people in the commander\u2019s tent, but the atmosphere was tense.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhong was seated at the head of the table with his two trusted lieutenants by his side. To his left was the secretary of their current march, Xiao Bojian. To his right was the representative of the northern border troops who had come to request aid, He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian lifted up one of the teacups set out on the table in front of him, his feminine features set into an expression that spoke trouble for He Changdi. \u201cCaptain He, I hope that you\u2019ll understand the situation that you\u2019re in now. The great general just has one small request. If you agree to it, then our rescue army will immediately hand over the supplies once we finish preparing them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi had turned pale with rage. He gripped the edge of the table with one hand so tightly that his veins bulged against his skin. Although he had managed to keep his expression cool and focused, anyone could tell that he was furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to take advantage of us while we\u2019re in need!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian was enjoying He Changdi\u2019s little fit of temper very much. He smiled, \u201cThis is where you\u2019re wrong, Captain He. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch in this world. We\u2019re happy to provide whatever you need, but you should be able to fulfill our teeny tiny little request in return, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang glanced at Yuan Zhong, but the general had his head lowered as he seemingly downed some wine to drown his troubles. He was clearly silently agreeing with Xiao Bojian\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>He Changdi felt immense disappointment. If Great General Qian were to find out what Yuan Zhong had done today, he would likely be equally, if not even more, disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain He, it would be wiser to acquiesce to our request. You might be able to continue waiting, but those fifty thousand soldiers in the northern border might not.\u201d Xiao Bojian was practically sneering at him.</p><br/><p>Under these circumstances, he didn\u2019t believe that He Changdi would keep the blueprints of the snowboat in exchange for the lives of his comrades.</p><br/><p>Dejection appeared on He Changdi\u2019s face, as if he had finally given in to Xiao Bojian\u2019s forceful threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll give you the blueprints for the snowboat. But you have to give me half a day\u2019s time. I have to persuade the brothers who accompanied me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi shut his eyes. Shame was displayed on his handsome features, along with plenty of helplessness. Seeing such a pained expression on his rival, a wave of satisfaction flooded Xiao Bojian\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, at least you\u2019ve managed to think it through, Captain He. I\u2019ll have someone escort you back. I hope you won\u2019t make us wait too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang left with an air of defeat. However, the moment he was sure that Xiao Bojian could no longer see his face, his gaze sharpened.</p><br/><p>Once He Changdi was gone from the tent, Yuan Zhong\u2019s melancholy and troubled expression faded away and he suddenly lit up with energy. He walked over to Xiao Bojian\u2019s side and patted his shoulder, praising him, \u201cYour idea worked, Wujing! As long as we get those blueprints and make even more of those snowboats, then the achievements of the northern border troops will be ours!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian played along and praised the general as well. After getting complimented, Yuan Zhong felt even better.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai and Xiao Hongyu quickly welcomed He Sanlang once he returned to the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother He, how did it go?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi sat down by the table and shook his head with his brows tightly furrowed, \u201cIt looks like they won\u2019t give in unless we hand over the snowboat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen did you agree to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang clenched his fists and nodded, \u201cI agreed to give them the blueprints before night falls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu\u2019s eyes widened in shock after hearing that. He spoke in disbelief, \u201cBrother He, you actually agreed to it?! What if they refuse to give us the supplies after you give them the blueprints? Does this mean that our fifty thousand troops can\u2019t do anything but wait for death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai hurriedly stopped Xiao Hongyu once he noticed how agitated he was getting. \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? Would your Brother He be so stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished scolding Xiao Hongyu, Zhang Mai turned to He Changdi, \u201cZixiang, tell me honestly. Do you have a backup plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi looked at the two men with his lips pressed together and a resolute glint in his eyes. There was no hint of the desolation he had shown back in the commander\u2019s tent. \u201cIt\u2019s not time yet, so I can\u2019t tell you guys. But as long as you trust me, I won\u2019t disappoint you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Since you\u2019ve said so, this old brother will trust you!\u201d Zhang Mai\u2019s gaze showed the same determination. He didn\u2019t forget to pat Xiao Hongyu\u2019s shoulder, \u201cBrat, did you hear that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu took a deep breath, but it was obvious that he still had unvoiced objections. He sat by the bed silently, unlike his normal boisterous self.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai shook his head, \u201cThat\u2019s just how he is. Don\u2019t mind him. He\u2019ll be fine later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi and the rest had been living together for a few months. He was even sharing a tent with Xiao Hongyu, so of course he knew the brat\u2019s personality well.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t mind it at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her face immediately flushed red from her anger.</p><br/><p>Zou Yuanqin was just a twelve-year-old girl after all. She was also a favoured legitimate daughter in her house, and Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s companion. She was usually pampered by everyone, and the one thing she hated the most was when anyone challenged her authority. Chu Lian\u2019s comment had sparked the fuse on her firecracker temper.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Lian! How dare you doubt my words! Don\u2019t think that you can accuse us like this just because you\u2019re too poor to pay us back! Let me tell you now, I don\u2019t care about the thousand taels!\u201d Zou Yuanqin\u2019s face was completely red by now.</p><br/><p>Madam Huang hadn\u2019t expected her daughter to lose her calm after a single sentence from Chu Lian. She frowned and shot a look at Zou Yuanqin. Unfortunately, Zou Yuanqin was currently blinded by her rage and didn\u2019t notice the look from her mother.</p><br/><p>Madam Huang suddenly regretted agreeing to her daughter\u2019s request about using that plate of longevity peach buns to make things difficult for Chu Lian. However, now that her daughter had spoken, it wasn\u2019t appropriate for her to step in. If she stepped in now, it would seem as if she was bullying a junior. Chu Lian was still a young lady who had just come of age, after all.</p><br/><p>In Zou Yuanqin\u2019s rage, she had actually called out Chu Lian\u2019s full name. In a public event like this, calling out someone\u2019s full name, especially a married woman\u2019s, was extremely rude.</p><br/><p>Zou Yuanqin\u2019s sudden flare of temper caused the spectating noble madams to frown. She was already twelve this year. In another two years, it would be time for her to be engaged. By being this unruly in such a public place with so many noble madams watching, she was actually spoiling her own chances of finding a good husband.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled inwardly; it was a hundred years too early for this little brat to think of trapping her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth Miss Zou, a thousand taels isn\u2019t a small sum for me. Of course I\u2019ll have to ask a few questions to understand what\u2019s going on. Please excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had generously admitted to her own shortcomings. Yes, she was poor. Although her maiden family had a noble title, they were already on the decline. This was common knowledge, and there wasn\u2019t any need to hide it. At this point in time, if she tried to pretend to be rich and flaunt her wealth, that would simply draw their ire.</p><br/><p>She already knew that these stupid buns had definitely cost a thousand taels. If they were trying to humiliate her, Madam Huang definitely wasn\u2019t going to lie! However, she had purposely brought up this line of talk in order to make Zou Yuanqin get angry.</p><br/><p>By freely admitting her financial situation, Chu Lian actually garnered the admiration and respect of quite a few spectators. Not everyone had the courage to admit their shortcomings in front of a crowd, since most people were conceited creatures.</p><br/><p>Compared to Chu Lian, Zou Yuanqin seemed even more willful and arrogant, like a bully on a power trip.</p><br/><p>The slender finger that she was pointing at Chu Lian began to shake out of rage. However, Chu Lian appeared unperturbed. She stood her ground and serenely gazed forward, like Zou Yuanqin was the one at fault and was making a fuss out of nothing.</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao glared unhappily at Zou Yuanqin.</p><br/><p>When Zou Yuanqin saw Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s glare, her heart clenched. Even if she didn\u2019t want to continue this farce, she had to.</p><br/><p>Zou Yuanqin hardened her stance and said, \u201cChu Lian! No matter what, you have to account for this to my mother! There\u2019s only an hour left until we have to serve the longevity peach buns at the outer court. If we miss the lucky hour, my grandfather\u2019s feast will be ruined! I\u2019ll make you go to the banquet hall and ask for forgiveness from my grandfather right then and there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Zou Yuanqin\u2019s ultimatum, Imperial Princess Leyao finally let the dissatisfied expression on her face disappear. She watched the cornered Chu Lian with renewed interest.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see if she can get out of this now!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian, meanwhile, was listening to the discussions of the spectating noble madams.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam\u2019s unlucky day today. Those longevity peach buns weren\u2019t made by just anyone; they were made by De\u2019an Restaurant\u2019s Mr Wang! That chef has a really strange temperament. He only makes them once per person! By now, the people in the banquet hall must have heard that Mr Wang\u2019s longevity peach buns are being served today. It\u2019ll be tough for House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam to settle this incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mind blanked out a little, and she felt the urge to laugh. If she had the chance to, she would like to meet this Mr Wang someday! Although he didn\u2019t make very good-looking longevity peach buns, he had plenty of rules to go around!</p><br/><p>However, the more rare something was, the more valuable it became. By setting such a rule, this Mr Wang had guaranteed that there would be people coming after his peach buns based on its rarity alone. They would be more willing to fork over as much as they could afford to.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian recalled that there was an engagement ring company who only allowed men to buy a single ring from them in their lifetime. This Mr Wang had done something similar and his business was booming; could he possibly be a transmigrator, too?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tilted her head to the side. Her eyes were as clear as glass, and a pretty colour to boot. Her honest expression generated plenty of goodwill for her amongst the crowd. If this continued, there wouldn\u2019t be a single person who would believe that she had knocked over that plate of buns on purpose.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s brows knit together. She sincerely said, \u201cFifth Miss Zou, I don\u2019t have a thousand taels of silver.\u201d</p><br/><p>She really didn\u2019t have a thousand taels, or anything close to it. Even if she included the ruby ornament she was wearing right now, she wouldn\u2019t even have half of that amount.</p><br/><p>Hearing her reply, Zou Yuanqin cast a contemptuous look at her. She smirked. \u201cThen go to the banquet hall and plead for forgiveness from my grandfather!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

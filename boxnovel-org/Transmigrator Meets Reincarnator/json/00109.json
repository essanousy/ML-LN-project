Please don\u2019t pin all your hopes on that restaurant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian finally turned to look at Senior Servant Gui. \u201cMomo, I know that you only have my best interests at heart, but for matters like this, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike her usually soft and kind voice, the Chu Lian of now carried the strict authority of a person in power.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui stiffened and quickly stopped speaking.</p><br/><p>Although Third Young Madam\u2019s personality had changed and she had become much more easy-going with them as compared to before, it didn\u2019t mean that Senior Servant Gui could overstep her bounds as a servant and think to change her master\u2019s decisions. She had committed one of the taboos as a servant.</p><br/><p>Finally realising what she had done, Senior Servant Gui broke out into cold sweat.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had the same thoughts. Although she didn\u2019t like being harsh towards others and preferred to live casually, even to the point of being a little dazed and silly at times, she never played around with important matters. She also had her own ideas, and hated when others tried to make decisions for her.</p><br/><p>She knew that her way of thinking was very different from the way the people here thought, so upon arriving in the Great Wu Dynasty, she had always tried to be as easygoing as possible. However, that didn\u2019t mean she would allow others to interfere with her choices.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the silver accessories today, as well as any important decisions from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old servant understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian saw that Senior Servant Gui had finally gotten the message, her expression softened and returned to her usual tender smile. Her gentle demeanor also returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMomo, you have to trust me. Money is easy to earn!\u201d Chu Lian even broke out into a mischievous grin, blinking innocently at Senior Servant Gui.</p><br/><p>Although Senior Servant Gui was nodding on the surface, she didn\u2019t believe Chu Lian\u2019s words a single bit on the inside. Even though Third Young Madam had a good head on her, due to her status back in the Ying Estate, she hadn\u2019t been able to interact much with the outside world. Third Young Madam\u2019s stepmother had never really taught her much about the world either, so it would be normal if Chu Lian had good ideas, but not the experience to execute them well.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui sighed inwardly. It might be best to let Third Young Madam suffer some setbacks so that she could understand clearly.</p><br/><p>After dismissing Senior Servant Gui from the room, Chu Lian kept the gold bricks in the wooden box. Now that she had these gold bricks at hand, she had a total capital of six hundred taels. Although this was already a huge sum in the eyes of most people, it wasn\u2019t enough at all for Chu Lian. She opened up another brocade box on the side, this time to admire Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s golden qilin that sat within. The corners of her lips lifted up into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial Princess Leyao, since you like your Brother He so much, I\u2019ll let you donate the rest of my funds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before heading off to sleep, Chu Lian flipped through the account book that Matriarch He had given her for Guilin Restaurant.</p><br/><p>What she had was the accounts of the last three months. Since there were barely any customers, the records for all three months could fit into a single thin book.</p><br/><p>Without even talking about whether the numbers would add up correctly in such a thin account book, Chu Lian couldn\u2019t agree on the way the accounts were being recorded. She could see that there were quite a few places where the records didn\u2019t make sense, just from skimming through them roughly.</p><br/><p>For example, the following entries\u2026</p><br/><p>1st June: Kitchen expenses, 1 tael.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kitchen expenses\u2019?</p><br/><p>What had they bought? Was it the fresh ingredients for the day, kitchen utensils, or even furniture? They had only described the expenditure in such vague terms that she had to suspect that there was embezzling going on.</p><br/><p>12th June:</p><br/><p>2.5kg of pork, 100 coins.</p><br/><p>Chinese cabbage, 10 coins.</p><br/><p>Tea leaves, 500 coins\u2026</p><br/><p>There had only been two or three customers daily for the first half of June. At its lowest, there might not even be any customers at all. At the peak, there had never been more than five customers in a day. And amongst all these diners, only one person had even ordered a pork dish.</p><br/><p>This meant that Guilin Restaurant\u2019s pork dishes weren\u2019t very popular, so they shouldn\u2019t be buying more than 0.5kg of pork a day. However, on that day, they had bought five times that amount. So they were using the company\u2019s accounts for their own expenses, hmm?</p><br/><p>Hehe!</p><br/><p>She had only gone through a third of this thin account book, and she had already found so many suspicious points. There was no need to keep reading further.</p><br/><p>It looked like there wasn\u2019t just a problem in management for this Guilin Restaurant, but there were also some rats amongst the employees. Even if this group of embezzlers were to run the most popular restaurant in the entire capital, it would probably still be a losing business!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

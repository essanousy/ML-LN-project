He waved at Laiyue impatiently. Laiyue had already been serving He Changdi for years, so he understood what He Changdi wanted. He turned and instructed the maidservants to send the ingredients to their courtyard\u2019s kitchen.</p><br/><p>Although the kitchen here wasn\u2019t used often, it was quite clean as the servants would still clean it every day. For a period of time, each courtyard would have to settle their own meals. As for the cookware, Madam Zou sent some senior servants over with a set overnight. She even sent some firewood and charcoal with them.</p><br/><p>There were no large surfaces for dining in the study room. There was only a writing desk and a few side tables. The two maidservants who brought the food in were at a loss of what to do; they didn\u2019t know where to place the dishes.</p><br/><p>The moment He Changdi entered the study, he saw the two maidservants standing there carrying the boxes with troubled expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>One of the servants drummed up the courage to say, \u201cThird Young Master, we really can\u2019t hold dinner here. Why don\u2019t we place the dishes in the parlour?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s expression turned dark right after she finished speaking. He tossed a gloomy glance at her, and following that, he ordered her to scram.</p><br/><p>The two low-ranking maidservants were so frightened that they trembled, put down the food, and didn\u2019t dare to stay a second longer. They hurriedly ran out as if a deadly tiger was after them.</p><br/><p>Third Young Master usually looked handsome and heroic; who knew that he would be so frightening once he got angry?</p><br/><p>The poor servants\u2019 ideal image of him was instantly crushed.</p><br/><p>Laiyue came in from outside and saw that the maidservants had run off with pale faces. He scratched his head with a bemused look on his face. He shivered a little when he spotted He Sanlang\u2019s cold expression.</p><br/><p>Laiyue cleared his throat and carefully asked, \u201cYoung Master, when do you want to call Young Madam over to have dinner? It\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi harrumphed after hearing that. That wicked woman had already plotted and schemed against the entire estate today; did she really think she would be getting dinner?</p><br/><p>Hmph! Let her dream on!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo out and keep a watch! No one is allowed in without my permission, even Third Young Madam!\u201d He Changdi instructed without an ounce of compassion.</p><br/><p>Laiyue hadn\u2019t expected Third Young Master to say something like that. He instantly froze on the spot and didn\u2019t know how to react. His line of sight landed on the boxes sitting on the writing desk. He was about to say something, but shivered when he met with He Changdi\u2019s dispassionate gaze. His young master had never gone back on his words before and would never let him defy his orders. But was he really not going to let Third Young Madam eat?</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t good!</p><br/><p>However, Laiyue went out and kept watch at the door. He didn\u2019t dare to say a single word to He Sanlang.</p><br/><p>He Changdi stood before the writing desk with a profound look in his eyes. He then retrieved a thick envelope from a hidden compartment inside the desk. He carefully read through the letter inside, and after making sure there weren\u2019t any problems, he sealed the envelope and wrote the words: \u201cTo Grandmother\u201d.</p><br/><p>Then, He Sanlang placed the envelope inside the hidden compartment once again.</p><br/><p>The wick of the study\u2019s candle crackled. He Changdi turned back to the red lacquered boxes, the scent of food catching his attention as it drifted up to his nose.</p><br/><p>He stood up and opened both of them. Each had four to five layers, and there were different dishes in each one. There was steamed perch in ginger and scallion, roast mutton chops, spring chicken, and vegetables in one of the boxes. Soup and rice were packed in the second box, and there was even a warm wine flask1. Every dish looked exquisite and much better than what the main kitchen usually served. They must have come from the little kitchen in Matriarch He\u2019s courtyard.</p><br/><p>Although they had been left out for awhile, and the dishes were cold by now, they still looked appetizing and looked more delicious than what they had eaten last night.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang felt smug after looking at these dishes. Didn\u2019t that wicked woman love to eat? Well, she wasn\u2019t getting any!</p><br/><p>As he was savoring his revenge in his mind, He Changdi picked up some chopsticks and chose a few dishes to taste. However, the dishes might have gotten too cold, or perhaps he wasn\u2019t in a good mood. Although the two boxes were filled to the brim with delicious food, he barely tasted any of it. He ate a few bites before setting down his chopsticks.</p><br/><p>He sat down again and casually took out a book to read.</p><br/><p>1. The wine here isn\u2019t made of grapes, but is a Chinese white wine made from sorghum. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baijiu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

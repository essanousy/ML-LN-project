He ended up standing right next to Mo Chenggui in the corridor.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan shook his head helplessly and turned to Mo Chenggui. He complained, \u201cLeader Mo, I\u2019ve been dragged down by you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui had no desire whatsoever to acknowledge a literary official, who was just a weak chicken in his eyes. He simply harrumphed.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan wasn\u2019t deterred by the cold response and said, \u201cLi Xing, see here. I\u2019m not Leader Mo and I didn\u2019t argue with your mistress. Why can\u2019t you let me in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, please don\u2019t make it difficult for this subordinate. This subordinate is simply following Honoured Lady\u2019s orders. Honoured Lady said that this matter is top secret. Even when it\u2019s finished, she won\u2019t be able to give you a demonstration. The first priority is to send it to the border camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fine! He was dealing with another stick in the mud! Tang Yan finally gave up on trying to enter. His heart was itching with curiosity and he really wanted to know what miracle Chu Lian had somehow come up with to save fifty thousand border troops. However, since she wasn\u2019t willing to divulge the secret to him, he had no other choice.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan immediately turned around and left. He wasn\u2019t going to stand there in the cold wind and snow like that silly Mo Chenggui.</p><br/><p>On the way back to his own courtyard, Tang Yan was still trying to guess at what Chu Lian\u2019s solution was.</p><br/><p>What kind of magic powers did that Chu Lian have? Why was it that every single person by her side was so loyal to her? Even the guards from Prince Wei\u2019s estate, Li Xing and Li Yue, were already treating her like their real master. Could it be due to her foodie ways?</p><br/><p>As expected, foodies were full of potential.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan was shamelessly disregarding how he had taken every chance he could to take a meal over at Chu Lian\u2019s courtyard. During the past few days of heavy snowfall, he had constantly been sending guards over to check on what Chu Lian was eating in her courtyard\u2026</p><br/><p>Once the old carpenter had the rest of the materials in hand, he was able to work fast. They had already planned out the designs. Before actually starting the project, they had also made prototypes.</p><br/><p>Even so, they wasted a portion of the wood that had been gathered while working. Now on the brink of finishing, their materials fell short: they still needed one last plank\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had been watching from the side this whole time. The old carpenter stopped working and hurried over to Chu Lian a little anxiously. \u201cEsteemed Madam, we\u2019re still lacking one more piece of wood. It was all this old man\u2019s fault for having such clumsy skills\u2026 We wasted some of the wood earlier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked at the project. It did indeed look like it was nearly finished, so she sent the orders down to her subordinates.</p><br/><p>Wenqing quickly ran out to inform Manager Qin.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin had only gotten hit once with the rod, so he could bear with the pain in his buttocks. However, he could only stand and he wasn\u2019t able to sit. It would take a few days for him to recover enough to sit and lay on his back.</p><br/><p>When he saw Wenqing rushing out of the workroom, he moved forward to meet her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are we lacking something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing sighed. \u201cWe just need one more piece of fir wood! Why didn\u2019t you buy just one more this morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin sighed bitterly. It really wasn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t bought enough materials. He had been captured by Mo Chenggui while on the way back and Mo Chenggui had burned some of it as firewood. If not for him struggling and shouting that the fir wood was expensive, they might not have even had what they did.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t the time to explain this to Wenqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk Third Young Madam to wait a little longer. I\u2019ll go out right now and look for more fir. Rest assured, I\u2019ll definitely bring the remaining materials to Third Young Madam today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go quickly. I\u2019ll pass your words on to Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin rubbed his backside gingerly and hobbled towards the courtyard entrance.</p><br/><p>He cursed and swore at Mo Chenggui hundreds and thousands of times over in his heart.</p><br/><p>When he reached the entrance and looked up, only to see the man he had been cursing at, Manager Qin was so frightened he almost fell onto the ground. Once he could see the man\u2019s face clearly, Manager Qin spat on the ground and mumbled angrily under his breath, \u201cHow unlucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Mo Chenggui found it awkward as well, he still reached out to help Manager Qin find his feet before asking anxiously, \u201cManager Qin, how is that thing that Third Young Madam is building? I definitely won\u2019t interfere or leak any information, could you let me in to look at it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin snatched his arm back in a cold manner before sending a side-eyed glance at Mo Chenggui. Then, he said, \u201cThanks to Leader Mo\u2019s heroic actions, we\u2019re now short on fir wood so we can\u2019t complete the project. This humble one is about to go out and search for more!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

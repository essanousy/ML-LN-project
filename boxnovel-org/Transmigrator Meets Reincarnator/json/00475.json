Strength was slowly returning to her limbs. When she recalled what she had just done with He Changdi in bed, a furious blush flared back to life on her cheeks.</p><br/><p>She covered her burning cheeks with her hands and soaked in the bath in an absent-minded daze until the sound of footsteps resounded behind her.</p><br/><p>The moment she turned around, she was met with the gloomy-looking He Sanlang. Her husband stripped off his sleeping robe and tossed it haphazardly to one side before stepping right into the bathtub.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have any time to react before He Changdi was already in the bath with her. With another pull of his long arms, she was already wrapped in his naked embrace.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes widened in shock. It took her a moment to find her voice again, \u201cHe Changdi, what are you doing! Get out!\u201d</p><br/><p>The usual cold layer of frost had returned to He Sanlang\u2019s handsome face. He scooped up some warm water and poured it over Chu Lian\u2019s smooth shoulders before suddenly bending over to nibble her earlobe. His deep and hoarse voice echoed in the bathroom, \u201cWhat am I doing? I\u2019m just taking a bath!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian saw that his hands were starting to wander, so she started struggling. The level of water in the bath dwindled as water splashed all over the bathroom.</p><br/><p>In the end, they weren\u2019t able to finish their bath as half of the water in the tub had spilled over\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian let out a shrill cry as she was carried back to their bed by He Changdi.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang seemed to be trying to prove himself to her as he entered her continuously, ignoring Chu Lian\u2019s pleas for mercy. At last, he managed to last longer than their first hurried coupling\u2026</p><br/><p>Near the end, Chu Lian didn\u2019t even have the strength to lift a finger any longer. The moment He Changdi had finished, she dozed right off into sleep from fatigue.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was covered in beads of sweat all over, but his mood was the highest it had ever been.</p><br/><p>He pulled out and went off to the bathroom to clean himself. When he was done, he found a handkerchief and dipped it in warm water to clean Chu Lian\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>When he finished cleaning his wife and realised that red marks had been left all over her snow-white skin from his excessive use of force, guilt rose within him and he started feeling vexed with himself.</p><br/><p>He helped Chu Lian into a clean set of nightclothes and gently fed her a few spoonfuls of the warm honey water on the side table. Finally, he changed the bedsheets before carefully setting her back down on the bed and snuggling right in with her, gaze fixed on her defenseless sleeping expression.</p><br/><p>Outside, in the servant\u2019s wing, Xiyan was feeling sorry for her mistress.</p><br/><p>She knew that Chu Lian hadn\u2019t consummated her marriage with He Changdi on their wedding night and that this was the couple\u2019s first time together.</p><br/><p>Even at the start, when there hadn\u2019t been much movement from the bedroom, she had still been extremely worried.</p><br/><p>Later on, after Wenqing had gone in to prepare a hot bath, the sounds and movements coming from inside the bedroom were even louder than before.</p><br/><p>She could even hear her young madam\u2019s soft cries.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had never cried in front of her servants before. Xiyan was frantic with worry, afraid that Third Young Master was abusing her mistress.</p><br/><p>She had listened to the gossiping senior servants in the past when she had been bored. The servants had talked about how there was a servant being abused by her husband, who took out the stresses of his job on her and beat her until she cried for mercy.</p><br/><p>The more she thought about it, the more worried she got until she couldn\u2019t take it any longer. Xiyan abruptly stood up and spoke, \u201cI have to go in to check on Third Young Madam! I won\u2019t let anyone bully Third Young Madam, even if it\u2019s Third Young Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing was alarmed by Xiyan\u2019s declaration. How could she really let Xiyan enter the bedroom?</p><br/><p>If the two of them entered the bedroom at this time, their lives would likely be forfeit.</p><br/><p>She practised martial arts, so her hearing was more acute than Xiyan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Senior Servant Zhong had specially educated them on the birds and the bees, so she was much more knowledgeable than Xiyan on these matters.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy for her to explain it so openly. However, she understood that it was always hard for women on their first time. Although she felt for Third Young Madam as well, she was more afraid of Third Young Master.</p><br/><p>They were just servants, so it was better if they didn\u2019t interfere with their masters\u2019 activities.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

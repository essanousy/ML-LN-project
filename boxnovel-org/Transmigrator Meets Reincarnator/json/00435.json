Miss Pan is watching from the side!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, with the reminder that her granddaughter was watching, Matriarch He slowly got her emotions under control. She let go of her daughter and dabbed at her tears before finally getting a good look at her daughter. When she was satisfied, she turned her gaze to her granddaughter, Pan Nianzhen.</p><br/><p>He Ying pulled her daughter closer, \u201cNianzhen, this is your maternal grandmother. Quick, greet her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was a little timid. She darted a glance at the kindly yet intimidating old lady before her and greeted in almost a whisper, \u201cGrandmother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a good child!\u201d The matriarch reached out and took Pan Nianzhen\u2019s hand in her own. She carefully looked over the young lady before asking, \u201cHow old is Nianzhen this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying looked at her daughter with pride, \u201cHer coming of age ceremony was done just this summer, so she\u2019ll be sixteen this coming year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sixteen years of age? That was considered an adult woman in the Great Wu Dynasty. It was also the right time to start preparing for marriage and it wouldn\u2019t be good to tarry on that matter.</p><br/><p>An idea sparked to life within Matriarch He.</p><br/><p>She let the two ladies sit down next to her. At the same time, she had also noticed that they were dressed in rather plain and shabby outfits.</p><br/><p>He Ying seemed to have sensed her mother\u2019s measuring gaze. She lowered her head in shame.</p><br/><p>The matriarch frowned, \u201cWhy are you dressed in this manner?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying glanced at her mother. Her lips parted, as if she wanted to speak, but it seemed like her shame was holding her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to dress up, you should have given Nianzhen a few good dresses at least. She should be dressing prettily at her age.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Matriarch He had spoken, He Ying could no longer hold back her words, \u201cMother, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not willing to, but I just don\u2019t have the money right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He stared in disbelief, \u201cDid you spend all of the silver I gave you back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying acted aggrieved when reminded of the money she had been given, \u201cMother, it\u2019s been so many years. How could there be anything left from just those ten thousands of taels?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He deeply regretted that she hadn\u2019t raised Miss Ying properly.</p><br/><p>She was actually dismissing those ten thousands of taels. How could ten thousands of taels be a small amount?</p><br/><p>Ten thousands of taels was enough to buy at least ten or more storefronts. Even if they did nothing with the storefronts and rented them out, they would be able to live much more comfortably than they seemed to be now. She would at least have the money to make some new clothes and accessories for her daughter.</p><br/><p>The frustration within the matriarch almost shot through the roof after that casual comment from her daughter.</p><br/><p>However, as angry as she was, she couldn\u2019t just let her daughter and granddaughter continue dressing so shabbily.</p><br/><p>She looked her daughter up and down once more before speaking again. \u201cThe two of you can stay in my Qingxi Hall for now. You\u2019re about the same size as I was back then, so you can take some of my clothes for now. Muxiang, lead Eldest Madam over to the storehouse in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muxiang respectfully acknowledged the orders.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He looked at the timid Pan Nianzhen and faced a dilemma.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was fifteen this year and in the prime of her life. Matriarch He didn\u2019t have any clothes suitable for her to wear. Even if they ordered the seamstresses to rush out something, it would still take a few days. It was already close to the year\u2019s end, so the clothes stores outside were all closed. They wouldn\u2019t be able to buy any ready made dresses. It was really a tough problem for the matriarch.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu was observant. She smiled and whispered a suggestion to the matriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cMatriarch, why don\u2019t you send someone over to Third Young Madam\u2019s courtyard to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that Senior Servant Liu had reminded her, realisation dawned upon the matriarch. That\u2019s right. Sanlang\u2019s wife was also fifteen. Although the two young ladies were a little different in size, it wasn\u2019t so drastic.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiangyun, take Miss Pan over to Sanlang\u2019s courtyard and borrow two outfits for the time being. Get our seamstresses to measure the two of them tomorrow afternoon to make some outfits they can wear,\u201d Matriarch He instructed Senior Servant Liu.</p><br/><p>Once those details were settled, Matriarch He held on to her daughter\u2019s hand and started chatting about their past memories.</p><br/><p>He Ying wanted to get closer to her mother, so she put all her efforts into caring for the matriarch. They started talking about He Ying\u2019s childhood and kept chatting until it was time for the midday meal.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, they had lunch served in the parlour of Qingxi Hall. Matriarch He shared the meal together with her daughter and granddaughter.</p><br/><p>On the table was Eight Treasure Duck, boiled fish with pickled cabbage and chilli, imperial tofu, pork strips in chilli sauce and meatballs in clear soup. There weren\u2019t that many dishes, but He Ying and her daughter were stunned.</p><br/><p>They had never eaten or even seen such exquisite dishes before.</p><br/><p>The parlour was filled with the fragrance of food.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, what\u2026 what is all this?\u201d He Ying pointed at the dishes and gulped.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He puffed up with pride at the mention of the food, \u201cThese dishes were all taught to our estate\u2019s cooks by Lian\u2019er. They\u2019re much better than what we had before. Come, have a taste! Nianzhen, start eating!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying found it strange. \u201cMother, who\u2019s Lian\u2019er? One of your maidservants?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He glared at her daughter upon hearing so, \u201cWhat nonsense are you speaking? Lian\u2019er is your niece-in-law! She married Sanlang this year in early autumn.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying\u2019s eyes almost bulged out at her shock, \u201cSanlang is married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou silly child. Have you forgotten everything as the years passed? Sanlang is already twenty this year, important matters like marriage can\u2019t be delayed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing her mother\u2019s reply, a trace of disappointment flashed across He Ying\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough of that. Let\u2019s eat first. Once we\u2019re done, Xiangyun will explain everything that has happened on our estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>None of what her mother and grandmother were talking about had gone into Pan Nianzhen\u2019s ears. She had just taken a bite of the Eight Treasure Duck and almost swallowed her tongue along with it because of how tasty it was. She couldn\u2019t help but think: how could there be such delicious food in the world?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

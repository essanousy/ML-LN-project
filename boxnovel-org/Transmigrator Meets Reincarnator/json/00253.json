His originally slim body had turned into a potbelly, giving the maidservants the urge to sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Madam, this is Guilin Restaurant\u2019s account book for the past month.\u201d Manager Qin bowed respectfully towards Chu Lian before offering up the account book with two hands.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian flipped through one or two pages of the book before setting it aside. \u201cManager Qin, give me a short summary of the accounts. I\u2019ll keep this account book and go through it in detail over the next few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin couldn\u2019t wait for Chu Lian to ask him about the accounts.</p><br/><p>He had learned how to manage shops by following his father around since he was young. Later on, as the years passed, he was able to manage businesses by himself. Perhaps due to the influence of his younger years, he was able to turn a normal store into a profitable business at the tender age of fifteen. He was already in his twenties now, but this Guilin Restaurant was one of the most successful businesses he had ever managed.</p><br/><p>Thus, he couldn\u2019t wait to show off his achievements to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>When Xiyan heard the number that Manager Qin reported, she froze on the spot from shock.</p><br/><p>Three thousand, five hundred and eighty taels!</p><br/><p>That was after subtracting the running expenses for Guilin Restaurant!</p><br/><p>That is to say, Guilin Restaurant had turned a profit of 3580 taels alone this month!</p><br/><p>Heavens!</p><br/><p>Taking away the 2000 taels of initial capital that Chu Lian had invested in Guilin Restaurant at the start, that was still 1800 tales of pure profit!</p><br/><p>What kind of concept was that?!</p><br/><p>Xiyan\u2019s mind immediately turned blank.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had already expected a profit from Guilin Restaurant, so she wasn\u2019t as shocked as Xiyan was. However, even so, that amount had completely exceeded her expectations for the first month. She had really underestimated the spending power of the people in the capital.</p><br/><p>After asking Manager Qin for a few more details, it was only an hour later that Senior Servant Gui escorted Manager Qin out.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian opened up the wooden box of money that Manager Qin had left behind and took out two bills to pass to Xiyan.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep these for Songtao Court\u2019s daily expenses. Mother\u2019s birthday is coming, so we can use that chance to give out some rewards for all the people in our courtyard. You can decide what to do with the rest of the money by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan held the two hundred-tael bank notes in her hands and spoke with disbelief in her tone, \u201cThird Young Madam, all this is from Guilin Restaurant\u2019s profit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glared at her speechlessly. \u201cOf course! Do you want to count through all the notes in this box and see if it\u2019s really a thousand taels?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan quickly shook her head. \u201cNo, no, this servant doesn\u2019t have to count it. This servant trusts that there\u2019s a thousand taels in there. Third Young Madam, you\u2019re amazing! This servant just can\u2019t really believe it. Back in the Ying Estate, it would have taken us quite a few years to save up a hundred taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blinked in surprise. She hadn\u2019t expected this girl to think back to the past. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t think about those things now. I\u2019m not the Sixth Miss of House Ying anymore. I\u2019m now House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam and an Honoured Lady personally named by the Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan rubbed away the tears that had leaked out unconsciously from her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Young Madam\u2019s days are much better now. If only Third Young Master could be by Young Madam\u2019s side, then all would be well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan\u2019s words made Chu Lian\u2019s face stiffen.</p><br/><p>Her days had been too carefree; she had almost forgotten that she had a husband who had gone off to the northern border.</p><br/><p>She wondered how that crazy, unfortunate husband of hers was doing. She hadn\u2019t gotten any letters from him for a month. Maybe the blank letters she had sent him had upset him and made him even more unhinged?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head. What was she doing thinking about He Sanlang?</p><br/><p>It was more important to pass her days in peace.</p><br/><p>She remembered that the Great Doctor Miao was supposed to appear in the capital around this time.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blinked and the corners of her lips lifted up in excitement.</p><br/><p>With her here, she wasn\u2019t going to let that Xiao Bojian get to Great Doctor Miao first.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, you really can\u2019t speak of the devil. Not even an hour had passed since she had thought about how He Sanlang hadn\u2019t sent any letters back for a while, when Senior Servant Liu personally came over to Songtao Court with some maidservants in tow.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stood up to welcome her.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu was wearing an azure cloak lined with down. Her hair was pressed flat to her face thanks to the outside winds, and it looked like she had rushed all the way here.</p><br/><p>\u201cMomo, please come in and sit! Have a cup of hot tea.\u201d Chu Lian quickly ordered Fuyan to serve some tea.</p><br/><p>It was already October and the weather was turning cold.</p><br/><p>Winters in the capital were always bitterly cold and dry.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu was clearly in high spirits as she took out a thick letter from her sleeve without waiting for the tea. She passed the letter to Chu Lian and said, \u201cThird Young Madam, Third Young Master personally wrote this for you! Look, it\u2019s such a thick letter, too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s lips parted in surprise as she took the parcel. \u201cHus\u2026. Husband sent letters back?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then that Senior Servant Liu took a seat and sighed. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t so! There was another letter for the matriarch as well. These were just sent here by a soldier from the posthouse. He said that there was a huge snowstorm near the northern border and the highways between the cities were blocked. We were supposed to get this letter about half a month ago, but it was delayed thanks to the snowstorm. I heard the northern border is supposed to be many times colder than the capital! Third Young Master has never been to the northern border before, I wonder if he\u2019ll be able to get used to the weather there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Senior Servant Liu spoke, her eyes started to redden and the tears gathered in her eyes fell.</p><br/><p>Amongst the three young masters in House Jing\u2019an, Senior Servant Liu cared the most for He Changdi. Back then, after Countess Jing\u2019an had given birth to He Changdi, her health had taken a turn for the worse and He Sanlang had been practically raised by his grandmother. Senior Servant Liu had taken care of He Sanlang alongside his nursemaid.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had gotten lost in her thoughts after hearing Senior Servant Liu\u2019s words. The weather at the northern border had already turned cold, and it was already snowing in the nearby cities!</p><br/><p>So early!</p><br/><p>There was no longer any trace of the excitement and joy she had had earlier. Instead, her brows drew together in tension.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Senior Servant Liu had seen such an expression on Third Young Madam. She thought that her words had caused Third Young Madam\u2019s to worry, so she quickly wiped away her tears and forced herself into using a happier tone. \u201cAh, it\u2019s this old servant\u2019s fault. Third Young Madam, please don\u2019t worry. Although Third Young Master looks a little skinny due to his height, he has been practising martial arts alongside the Count and his brothers ever since he was a child, and he\u2019s very skilled! The weather at the northern border must be nothing to him. Furthermore, all we\u2019ve heard is some hearsay from others, so it might not be true. See, Third Young Master sent out his letters after all. Third Young Madam, why don\u2019t you open it up and see what Third Young Master has written?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

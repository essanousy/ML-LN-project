I just didn\u2019t expect that the wife I happened to pick out for Sanlang would turn out to be such a lucky star.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it so! If Third Young Madam continues her friendship with Prince Wei\u2019s estate, it\u2019ll be tremendously beneficial for our estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Wei was extremely close to the current emperor, yet he wasn\u2019t involved in politics. His house was also known for being morally upright. Having connections with Prince Wei\u2019s estate would only bring them benefits, and no harm at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMatriarch, this old servant isn\u2019t sure whether to speak freely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He glared at Senior Servant Liu. \u201cYou silly servant. There\u2019s nothing that you can\u2019t say freely in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu paused her massage and moved over to face the matriarch. \u201cMatriarch, this old servant wonders if you noticed Eldest Young Madam\u2019s expression today. This old servant is afraid that Eldest Young Madam\u2019s thoughts may be straying towards the wrong path\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He sunk into silence.</p><br/><p>Dalang\u2019s wife!</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian returned to Songtao Court, she had a quick meal with some snacks before returning to her bedroom. It had been a physically and mentally taxing day for her, so she intended to go to bed early and get a good night\u2019s sleep.</p><br/><p>Regardless of the troubles currently plaguing her mind, Chu Lian determined that leaving the pondering to tomorrow was a better course of action than keeping herself up the entire night today.</p><br/><p>Fuyan pushed aside the gauze curtains on the bedchamber. First, she glanced at Xiyan, who was standing ramrod straight as she guarded the chamber. Next, she peeped at Chu Lian, lying on the bed.</p><br/><p>Although nothing showed on her expression, her curiosity was burning. She hated that she couldn\u2019t immediately question Xiyan about what had happened today.</p><br/><p>She wanted to know if Third Young Madam had met Mister Xiao today while out of the estate. Was she secretly having an affair with Mister Xiao?</p><br/><p>That high-quality dress that Third Young Madam had changed into was also suspicious. She couldn\u2019t possibly have changed into it after meeting Mister Xiao, right?</p><br/><p>All sorts of scenarios played out in Fuyan\u2019s mind. When she thought of Third Young Master\u2019s cool and handsome face, she pinched her palm for courage.</p><br/><p>Third Young Master was so good-looking. If Third Young Madam had betrayed Third Young Master, she\u2026 she wouldn\u2019t let it continue!</p><br/><p>Though Fuyan was so hung up over He Changdi\u2019s looks now, if she could see what He Sanlang looked like as he roughed it out at the northern border, she probably wouldn\u2019t be using the word \u2018handsome\u2019 to describe him any time soon.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian had already escaped Defend Teahouse long before the city guards\u2019 arrival, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t close by.</p><br/><p>Standing inside a fabric store opposite the teahouse, Xiao Bojian repeatedly clenched his hands into fists at his side. His eyes were murky, as if he were struggling inside. Finally, he turned and spoke to One in a low voice. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to Defeng Teahouse and see how Lian\u2019er is doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression on the bodyguard\u2019s average-looking, forgettable face seemed to flicker for a bit. However, in the end, he didn\u2019t disregard his master\u2019s request. He grunted in acknowledgement and merged back into the crowd on the street.</p><br/><p>After an hour, One was back.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian had already moved to a room on the second floor of the fabric store. He sat behind a desk, a calm expression on his face. However, his voice betrayed the anxiety he felt inside as he asked, \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>One cupped his fists. \u201cReporting to master. Sixth Miss Chu is already safe. Master can relax now. The city guards have already taken down all the assassins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian caught the thread of hesitation on One\u2019s face as he spoke. His expression darkened. \u201cWhat are you trying to hide? Speak!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

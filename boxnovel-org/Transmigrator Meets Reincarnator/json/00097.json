Since she had called her to Qingxi Hall alone, Matriarch He must have something to say to her alone.</p><br/><p>As expected, Matriarch He happily continued speaking. \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, I\u2019ve heard about what happened today. It must have been tough on you. Luckily, our Lian\u2019er is smart enough to outmaneuver any trickery. Grandmother heard that you\u2019ve gotten quite a few accessories from those madams. What are you planning to do with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old matriarch watched Chu Lian\u2019s expression as she waited for her reply.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared back at Matriarch He with wide eyes, appearing as if she was confused. Inwardly, she smiled.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was trying to test her!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian already had a plan for her spoils.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, I couldn\u2019t have gotten these accessories without Lady Yang\u2019s help, so I can\u2019t just take their accessories. Granddaughter-in-Law will write letters and prepare gifts in return tomorrow. Then I\u2019ll instruct some servants to send the accessories and gifts back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The slightly imposing expression on Matriarch He\u2019s face softened into kindness in an instant.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian continued, adding, \u201cAs for the others, I won them fair and square, so they\u2019re mine! Well, Imperial Princess Leyao might come asking for her golden qilin statue back\u2026 As for Madam Huang\u2019s precious pearl bracelet, I\u2019ll help to safeguard her treasure! She doesn\u2019t like me anyway, so I don\u2019t want to give it back to her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d Matriarch He couldn\u2019t hold back her laughter.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s somewhat childish tone made her want to pamper her even more.</p><br/><p>Although she had spoken in a childish manner, there was nothing wrong with the way she had chosen to take care of things. She had heard that most of the accessories were top-quality treasures, and very few girls would bear to send them back again once they had them, especially someone without many accessories herself, like Chu Lian. It was good that Sanlang\u2019s wife hadn\u2019t been blinded by greed and had chosen the right way to handle those \u2018prizes\u2019 of hers.</p><br/><p>Although she had been a little juvenile on some of the finer details, Chu Lian had a good grasp on how to please everyone involved overall. She had called Chu Lian over to knock some extra sense into her and make her more aware of the intricacies behind such dealings, but she hadn\u2019t expected that Chu Lian had already properly planned everything out.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He felt even more gratified that she had such a good granddaughter-in-law, but at the same time, she felt even guiltier about Chu Lian\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>That heartless brat Sanlang had abandoned such a wonderful wife! What a waste!</p><br/><p>Matriarch He knew about the conditions that Chu Lian had grown up in back at the Ying Estate, more or less. She wanted to wait and observe for a while longer, but after He Changdi\u2019s sudden departure and the events at the Dingyuan Estate today, Matriarch He felt that there was a need to push forward her plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, it\u2019s getting late. Why don\u2019t you return to your courtyard and rest a little earlier? Tomorrow, come over to Grandmother\u2019s place a little earlier. Grandmother has something else to say to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Chu Lian agreed and bowed to Matriarch He before leaving Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>The next day, Chu Lian made her way to Qingxi Hall early in the morning for her daily greetings.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He had also gotten up earlier, seemingly on purpose. When Chu Lian arrived, the matriarch was already sipping some tea in the parlour.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shot a glance at the sencha on the table and frowned a little.</p><br/><p>At the matriarch\u2019s advanced age, it wasn\u2019t good for her to drink tea that contained such a strange mix of spices.</p><br/><p>When Matriarch He saw that she had arrived, she waved her hand to indicate that Chu Lian should take a seat by her side.</p><br/><p>Once Chu Lian had settled in, Matriarch He passed a thin account book to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, open it and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian opened the account book curiously; within moments, she understood what it was. This was an account book for a restaurant. \u2018Guilin Restaurant\u2019 was written in tidy lettering on the first page.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, this is an account book for Guilin Restaurant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He smiled as she nodded. Guilin Restaurant was part of her dowry. It had already been in business for more than fifty years by now, and it could be considered one of the capital\u2019s long-established shops.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

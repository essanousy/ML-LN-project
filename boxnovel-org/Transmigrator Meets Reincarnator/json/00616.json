She felt really wronged. From the very beginning, she had never felt anything for him, alright!?</p><br/><p>Without any mercy, Chu Lian replied, \u201cSir Xiao, you need to know your place. I am Marchioness Anyuan and there is no connection between us. Therefore, there\u2019s no need to even mention like or dislike.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s head tilted down a little. His face was shrouded in darkness, so Chu Lian was unable to see his current expression.</p><br/><p>A moment later, he raised his head again. The malevolent look on his face had disappeared. All that was left was his usual gloominess.</p><br/><p>He suddenly spoke, \u201cLian\u2019er, do you want to know the truth about your mother, your birth mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>The life of the deceased first wife of House Ying\u2019s Second Master was basically a mystery.</p><br/><p>The moment Second Madam had passed on, it was as if nobody in House Ying remembered what she looked like. If it hadn\u2019t been for the existence of the Sixth Miss, Chu Lian, everyone would have thought that Second Master hadn\u2019t married before.</p><br/><p>Later on, when Chu Lian had grown up and started to become more aware, there was no one around her who knew anything about her mother. Even Senior Servant Gui who was closest to her only knew a little bit from hearsay.</p><br/><p>Since young, Chu Lian had wanted to know more about matters regarding her mother, but nobody would tell her. On the other hand, her father, Chu Qizheng, would get angry at the mere mention of Chu Lian\u2019s mother. Second Master had remarried very quickly and his new wife treated Chu Lian harshly. Once the new Second Madam had birthed her own daughter, she would constantly make things difficult for Chu Lian. This only increased Chu Lian\u2019s desire to know about her mother she had never gotten to meet.</p><br/><p>She would often fantasise about how her mother would look like if she were alive, especially when she was being bullied by her stepmother or Miss Yuan.</p><br/><p>Later on, Xiao Bojian had entered House Ying and Chu Lian had become friends with him. When the two chatted, Xiao Bojian learned about Chu Lian\u2019s wishes to find out more about her mother.</p><br/><p>The scheming Xiao Bojian had committed this to memory, and today, he had finally found a use for it.</p><br/><p>If the person who stood in front of him were the real Chu Lian, there was no doubt that she would definitely have become agitated and asked Xiao Bojian about things like what her mother looked like or her personality, and more.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the Chu Lian right now was already a completely different person.</p><br/><p>The original Chu Lian\u2019s mother had passed away a long time ago, and she didn\u2019t care enough to find out about the looks of a dead person.</p><br/><p>Even if she knew, it wasn\u2019t like it would do her any good.</p><br/><p>As a simple glutton, the current Chu Lian was simply uninterested in finding out other people\u2019s secrets, and wasn\u2019t a particularly curious person.</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Bojian thought that victory was within reach and he was excitedly waiting for Chu Lian to take the bait, Chu Lian calmly replied without so much as a ripple in her heart, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>In her mind, Chu Lian thought that this was none of her business at all, she\u2019d rather go home earlier and hug He Sanlang to sleep\u2026</p><br/><p>It was as if a bucket of icy water had been dumped over Xiao Bojian\u2019s head, dousing his excitement. His gloomy and slightly feminine face was filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pouted, \u201cMy mother died so many years ago, I don\u2019t even remember what she looks like, and I\u2019m not interested in that anymore. Now, tell me where Royal Princess Duanjia is.\u201d</p><br/><p>A contorted expression suddenly appeared on Xiao Bojian\u2019s face again. It was unknown whether he had become angry from her words, or if he was enraged by the fact that things hadn\u2019t progressed the way he expected. He spoke to Chu Lian with an angry tone, \u201cChu Lian, this clearly wasn\u2019t what you said back then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes shifted away a little. She wanted to stall for time.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone changes. Even if I wanted to know about it in the past, I am no longer interested now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Xiao Bojian was seething with rage.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shot a signal at Wenqing with her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, you\u2019ve changed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mouth twitched. Xiao Bojian was too slow. It wasn\u2019t just her personality that had changed, she was practically a different person, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to try signalling your servant. With her level of martial arts, she isn\u2019t even a match for my guard.\u201d Saying that, Xiao Bojian glanced back at the shadow-like One.</p><br/><p>Two words came out of his mouth, \u201cTake her!\u201d</p><br/><p>One moved like a sudden wind. Although Wenqing\u2019s martial arts weren\u2019t bad, there was still an insurmountable difference between her and One who was specially trained as an assassin.</p><br/><p>With only a few moves, One had knocked Wenqing unconscious. However, when One was about to grab hold of Chu Lian, he was blocked by a figure who suddenly leapt out of the darkness.</p><br/><p>One looked at the man who wielded a sword in front of him, and stared at the man with disbelief.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had suddenly appeared with his handsome but grim face and frosty eyes. His chilly gaze fell upon Xiao Bojian, and he spoke with his deep, tantalising voice, \u201cXiao Wujing, just where are you trying to take my wife to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian gave He Changdi a death stare. He nearly fainted from the force of his fury. His hands which were at his sides turned into fists, and he clenched them so much force that the joints turned white.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

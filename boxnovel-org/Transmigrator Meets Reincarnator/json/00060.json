The poor manservant replied in agreement and left to carry out his orders, though not without a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>Halfway to the kitchen, Laiyue still felt uncomfortable. That look from Third Young Master had been like a firebrand; even though he hadn\u2019t been able to meet eye-to-eye with that fiery gaze, he still felt tense, as if his skin had been scorched by the encounter.</p><br/><p>Laiyue shook his head helplessly. He couldn\u2019t understand how the gentle, refined Third Young Master had suddenly turned into this unreadable, fearsome young man.</p><br/><p>No matter how much the servant in the kitchen pled, Laiyue still took away the bowl of snow fungus and lotus seed porridge sitting on the stove and brought it to the study.</p><br/><p>When he brought it to He Sanlang and lifted the porcelain cover, the refreshing, delicious scent of lotus seeds drifted up. The porridge had been cooked until the rice grains were thin and sticky, while the snow fungus had turned translucent. There was no trace of the thick flavour of meat in the porridge; instead, there were plump, cute lotus seeds mixed in with the grains. Anyone\u2019s appetite would have been awakened by the mere sight of it. This kind of porridge really suited the current hot summer.</p><br/><p>Laiyue couldn\u2019t resist gulping as he watched from the side.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang, on the other hand, inwardly snorted at the dish\u2019s presentation. How had he missed this in his previous life? That wicked woman really knew how to eat well.</p><br/><p>\u201cServe a bowl for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue scooped some porridge into a small celadon bowl and placed it in front of He Sanlang.</p><br/><p>Without another word, He Sanlang dug in with his spoon, scooping some porridge into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Soft, sticky, fragrant and sweet, it was simple and refreshing to the taste, exactly like its scent.</p><br/><p>Since He Sanlang hadn\u2019t said anything, Laiyue stood by his side and didn\u2019t dare to move away. He watched as his reserved master, who usually didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, gulp down bowl after bowl of that snow fungus and lotus seed porridge without any hint of stopping\u2026</p><br/><p>By the time He Changdi put down his personal bowl, there was nothing left in the original dish that Laiyue had brought to the study. Not even a single grain remained\u2026</p><br/><p>Laiyue\u2019s mouth twitched and he lowered his head. He didn\u2019t dare to make a single sound and quietly took the bowls away from the study.</p><br/><p>As he stood outside, Laiyue looked at the empty bowls and shook his head regretfully. It must\u2019ve been delicious, based on the way Young Master had been so heartily eating. What a pity that Young Master hadn\u2019t missed a single drop; otherwise, maybe Laiyue could have had a taste of it too.</p><br/><p>With food in his stomach, especially since it was something that Chu Lian had prepared for herself as next morning\u2019s breakfast, He Sanlang\u2019s tense mood immediately relaxed into something lighter.</p><br/><p>When he thought of how that wicked woman would wake up to find that the porridge she had worked so hard to make was gone, he felt positively elated.</p><br/><p>Now filled with energy, he read some military strategy books for two more hours before he finally washed up and went to bed with a light heart.</p><br/><p>Back in the kitchen, when the servant assigned to watch the porridge saw that Third Young Master\u2019s personal manservant had forcefully taken it away, she hurriedly ran to report to Senior Servant Gui.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui nodded and sent the servant back.</p><br/><p>The next morning, the moment Chu Lian woke up, Senior Servant Gui reported the matter to her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mouth wordlessly twitched.</p><br/><p>Conversely, it was Senior Servant Gui who filled in Chu Lian\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>She picked out a hairpin made with kingfisher feathers and inserted it into Chu Lian\u2019s hair. Senior Servant Gui smiled as she said, \u201cThird Young Madam, you must have left that porridge out for Third Young Master on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting exposed, Chu Lian\u2019s cheeks reddened as she blushed. She pouted. \u201cWho would leave something out for that guy to eat? Didn\u2019t he eat before coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui smiled and stopped speaking, understanding that the young lady was too shy to admit it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

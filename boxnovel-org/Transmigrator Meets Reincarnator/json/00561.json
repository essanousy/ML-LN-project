It\u2019s from Manager Qin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian opened the letter and skimmed through it quickly.</p><br/><p>When she finished reading, she smiled and said, \u201cManager Qin has finished setting up the simple market, so he and the others are already on the way back to the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since everything was going swimmingly, Xiyan was happy as well.</p><br/><p>The mood in Songtao Court was harmonious with the sounds of laughter and happy chatter, but it was the complete opposite in the gloomy Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>The matriarch slammed the letters in her hand on the side table, her complaints bursting out in a furious exclamation. \u201cThis is absurd! How can these people be so brazen!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying stood by her side, dabbing at her tears. \u201cMother, please don\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s all my fault. I couldn\u2019t find a good chef, causing Guilin Restaurant to get criticised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu stood behind the matriarch and patted the matriarch\u2019s back. There was a disapproving expression on her face as she looked at He Ying.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, stop weeping. This isn\u2019t completely your fault; Sanlang\u2019s wife transferred all of the original personnel away, so there\u2019s nothing you could have done about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying wiped away her tears and nodded dejectedly. \u201cMother, what are we going to do then? Our family still needs funds! We couldn\u2019t possibly go borrowing from others, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only a small amount of funds left in the public accounts in the first place. After they were returned to Matriarch He\u2019s hands, Muxiang and He Ying had both taken their cut, leaving a paltry sum of income. The funds couldn\u2019t cover their estate\u2019s expenses now.</p><br/><p>The matriarch\u2019s brows were furrowed tightly together. She hadn\u2019t thought that she would have to worry about their bread and butter even after reaching such a grand old age. She should\u2019ve been happily retired by now.</p><br/><p>Seeing the terrible expression on the matriarch\u2019s face, Pan Nianzhen spoke up in a soft tone, \u201cGrandmother, I\u2019ve heard that Aunt\u2019s health has gotten much better. She can get off the bed and walk around now, as well as take care of the management of her courtyard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to Pan Nianzhen\u2019s reminder, a lightbulb went off in He Ying\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>She looked approvingly at her daughter. \u201cMother, Nianzhen is right. You\u2019re already in your golden years. This is when you should be able to relax and enjoy the fruits of your labour. It shouldn\u2019t be up to you to manage these tiresome matters in the estate. Sister-in-Law\u2019s health wasn\u2019t up to the task in the past, but now that she\u2019s healthy again, shouldn\u2019t she be the one to manage these household matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch\u2019s body wasn\u2019t as hearty and hale as it had been in the past. She was starting to struggle with the estate\u2019s management. Her daughter\u2019s suggestion sounded perfectly reasonable to her. Since she didn\u2019t want to handle these trivialities any longer, she might as well hand it off to her daughter-in-law.</p><br/><p>Her daughter-in-law had been resting for so many years. It was indeed time for her to take the mantle back up again.</p><br/><p>Gears were turning in Eldest Madam\u2019s head as she thought of how best to gouge another cut from the funds after handing the public accounts over to Countess Jing\u2019an.</p><br/><p>Once the account books reached her sister-in-law\u2019s hands, it would then be her business to take care of making ends meet. It wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with her.</p><br/><p>While He Ying was deep in thought, the matriarch brought up an abrupt question. \u201cMiss Ying, how are Nianzhen\u2019s marriage prospects going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the new year had passed, Matriarch He had been busy looking at potential grooms for Pan Nianzhen. Her friends had passed on some candidates, but her daughter and granddaughter had rejected all of them.</p><br/><p>Actually, she wasn\u2019t very satisfied with the choices presented either. Most of them were from minor officials\u2019 families, or some poor households. If the potential candidate had some money, then it was only because they were a lowly merchant.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the matriarch hadn\u2019t taken Pan Nianzhen\u2019s status into consideration while thinking this.</p><br/><p>Other than being linked to House Jing\u2019an through her mother, she didn\u2019t have any other redeeming qualities to her. Her mother was also a widow who had abandoned her husband\u2019s house. In her younger days, her mother had also made a bad name for herself.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy to collect this list of men without any bad reputation.</p><br/><p>Actually, He Ying didn\u2019t like the potential candidates because she had her mind set on He Erlang.</p><br/><p>She secretly glanced at her mother to gauge her mood before pretending to be furious. \u201cAll of them are looking down on us! Look at who they\u2019ve recommended. Miss Zhen has been suffering with me ever since her childhood. How could I let her marry just anyone? Wouldn\u2019t she have to continue suffering under her mother-in-law after marrying then?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

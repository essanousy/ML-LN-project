As they saw what their marchioness had packed, the old steward couldn\u2019t help the twitch that developed in the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Just look at all this!</p><br/><p>A specially made metal wok, a strange metal rack with unknown purpose, all sorts of ingredients that a hunting ground would lack, seasonings he had never heard of, jerky, fruits, desserts\u2026</p><br/><p>Of the luggage they had brought in that one carriage, half of it was food\u2026 As for the other half, they were all things to cook food\u2026</p><br/><p>In comparison, look at what the noble madam over there had brought: clothes, accessories, incense, all sorts of furnishings\u2026</p><br/><p>The old steward bowed his head in shame, resigned to his fate. He continued helping his noble madam move all sorts of food-related items into the tent.</p><br/><p>However, the foodies staring at Chu Lian and He Changdi\u2019s tent didn\u2019t share the same thoughts.</p><br/><p>Before they had even started preparing the meal, there was already a table full of guests in Chu Lian\u2019s tent\u2026</p><br/><p>Sima Hui and Royal Princess Duanjia were to be expected, since they were both ladies. However, what was with Great General Qian and Old Duke Zheng inviting themselves in? What were these two old beardies doing here?</p><br/><p>Captain Guo, Xiao Hongyu, and Zhang Mai didn\u2019t have any space to sit.</p><br/><p>However, they would rather stand than leave.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia rolled her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Liu, tell your servants to cook a little less, just enough for our table to eat. Ignore those gluttons standing over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast in the rush to leave this the morning. As a young man, he couldn\u2019t bear with the hunger and was starving by now. Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s words only made him feel even more stubborn.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, due to the princess\u2019 status, he couldn\u2019t respond to her provocation.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry looking at the tent full of guests.</p><br/><p>For the nobles settling into the hunting grounds, they had brought their servants to cook their meals.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s meals were taken care of by his attendants, but for the three soldiers, they had to take care of their own meals. It was only if the emperor specially ordered a feast to be held that they would be able to gather for dinner.</p><br/><p>Looking at the number of guests, the maidservants they had brought wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><br/><p>The sight that first greeted He Changdi when he entered their tent was their table full of guests. His expression immediately turned overcast.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t say anything with Old Duke Zheng and Great General Qian around, since their statuses were greater than his.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked at the ingredients that the steward had brought and wondered what to cook.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the steward had packed extra food just in case, otherwise there might not have been enough to feed this group of gluttons.</p><br/><p>Since there were so many people present, Chu Lian told Wenqing to grill some lamb chops and prepare a large pot of sour beef stew.</p><br/><p>The sour beef stew contained a lot of mushrooms and vegetables. It was very appetising when paired with white rice.</p><br/><p>It was the best dish for a large party like this.</p><br/><p>Since they were in the wilderness, they could prepare simple dishes without being too fussy about the presentation.</p><br/><p>As Wenqing and Wenlan worked on the lamb chops and sour beef stew, Chu Lian continued looking through the ingredients they had brought.</p><br/><p>She lifted the cloth covering a small bamboo basket.</p><br/><p>When she saw what was inside the basket, Chu Lian\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>Stinky tofu!</p><br/><p>This was what she had made a few days ago with the maidservants when she was bored.</p><br/><p>Since it couldn\u2019t be stored for long, the cook managing Songtao Court\u2019s kitchen had packed it in when the steward had told her to prepare ingredients for the trip.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian loved to eat fried stinky tofu the most back in the modern era, especially Changsha\u2019s special stinky tofu. The stinky tofu would be perfectly crisp once prepared properly. In order to make it Changsha style, she just had to spread a layer of bright red chilli paste on the outside. If you bit into it, it would be crispy and fragrant, with the perfect crunchiness on the outside and soft tofu on the inside.</p><br/><p>While it still stunk to high heaven, it was addictive once you got past the smell and took the first bite.</p><br/><p>Stinky tofu was a pretty marvelous food when you thought about it.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at the pieces of stinky tofu in the little bamboo basket and frowned.</p><br/><p>If she didn\u2019t use them up today, it would likely spoil.</p><br/><p>Wasting food was criminal.</p><br/><p>The weather was slowly warming up again. Fresh foods would spoil faster now.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she hadn\u2019t eaten stinky tofu in a long time and she had been craving for it for so long. She checked the time and realised that there was still enough time before the spring hunt to cook the stinky tofu.</p><br/><p>After a slight moment of hesitation, Chu Lian made her decision.</p><br/><p>She took up the little basket and moved over to the stove where Wenqing and Wenlan were preparing food.</p><br/><p>Wenlan was in the middle of seasoning the lamb chops.</p><br/><p>Seeing that her master had come over, Wenlan quickly set down the things in her hands and welcomed her, taking the little basket from her master\u2019s delicate hands.</p><br/><p>She even said, \u201cThird Young Madam, please rest and leave all the work to us servants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t resist bursting out into laughter. \u201cYou and Wenlan won\u2019t be able to do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenlan refused to admit defeat. She and her sister had been serving Third Young Madam for so long, and Third Young Madam had never been stingy with sharing her cooking techniques with her handmaids. How hard could making a few dishes for their guests be?</p><br/><p>Wenlan blinked and looked at the basket that she was now holding. \u201cThird Young Madam, what\u2019s in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed her curiosity. A mischievous glint passed through her eyes. \u201cIf you want to know, why don\u2019t you open it up?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

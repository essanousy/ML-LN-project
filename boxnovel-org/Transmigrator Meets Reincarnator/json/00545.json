It didn\u2019t take long before he found out what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Marchioness Anyuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was covered in bruises. He didn\u2019t know what the young nobleman before him had forced down his throat, but he understood that he had to reveal everything he knew in order to leave this place alive. He didn\u2019t dare to hide anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lord, my lord, please spare this humble one. This humble one doesn\u2019t know of any Marchioness Anyuan. This humble one was paid to do this, this humble one doesn\u2019t know anything else!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man trembled with fright. It wasn\u2019t long before a puddle spread on the floor beneath him, a clear sign that he had wet his pants.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly be lying, judging from the state he was in. He Changdi frowned in distaste and knocked the man out as well.</p><br/><p>As he was preparing to leave, it started getting noisy outside.</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan was leading a group of her sisters over. She smiled as she explained to them, \u201cSixth Sister is resting in this courtyard. Her status is so prestigious now that I wouldn\u2019t dare to disturb her if I were alone. With all of you as company, I\u2019m sure Sixth Sister won\u2019t feel like I\u2019m bothering her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following behind Miss Yuan were married madams and young ladies of the Chu Family. Miss Fu was included amongst them and was looking around the secluded little courtyard curiously.</p><br/><p>She found it a little strange that Chu Lian had chosen such a quiet courtyard out of all the guest rooms the Ying Estate had.</p><br/><p>Once they entered the courtyard, the ladies realised that there were already a few people standing within. That handsome man standing in the corridor not too far from the guest room\u2014 wasn\u2019t that the top scholar Sir Xiao?</p><br/><p>Why was he here at this time?</p><br/><p>A glint flashed through Chu Yuan\u2019s eyes. Although jealousy was churning in her heart, she didn\u2019t dare to meet the sinister and grim expression in Xiao Bojian\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Most of the ladies who had followed her here had never seen Xiao Bojian before. Although they thought it was weird for him to be here, the person they were here to see was Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>One of the married ladies had already spoken up with her misgivings, \u201cEighth Sister, you said that Sixth Sister is here, but I don\u2019t see her anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan purposefully frowned and turned towards the bedroom, \u201cMaybe she\u2019s inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, she tried to lead the group of women towards the room.</p><br/><p>The senior servant who had guided He Changdi here had been staying out of the way in a corner. When she saw what was about to happen, alarm spread through her and she leaped into action.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t let a bunch of unmarried ladies enter that room! There were inappropriate things going on in there!</p><br/><p>She tried to hold back Chu Yuan and the others, \u201cEighth Miss, please listen to this old servant. You can\u2019t enter the room right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ladies exchanged gazes, finding it odd that the servant would try to stop them, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you let us enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan was doing her best to avoid Xiao Bojian\u2019s icy gaze. She held up under the pressure and put on an innocent act, \u201c<i>Momo</i>, isn\u2019t Sixth Sister in there? Why can\u2019t we go in?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at the open doors and glanced over Laiyue, who was standing as still as a statue at the entrance. Realisation seemed to dawn upon her and she covered her mouth in shock, \u201cWait, is Sixth Sister actually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after she finished speaking, the distinctive sounds of a man\u2019s groans and a woman\u2019s moans rang out.</p><br/><p>The expressions of the ladies behind Chu Yuan changed. Those who were married instantly understood what those sounds meant.</p><br/><p>Everyone stared in the direction of the room with astonishment. They wished desperately for the ability to see through the walls to check out what was going on inside.</p><br/><p>They looked again at the tall guard standing in front of the entrance and his terrible expression, and their minds helpfully filled in the blanks.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Chu Lian was having a sordid affair in there right now? While meeting with her lover in there, had she actually been caught by her very own husband?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There were also several braziers placed around the room.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of chill even when she took off her cloak. She unfolded the blankets and dove into the bed. The warm and soft blanket covering her body made her sigh from comfort.</p><br/><p>With her entire body ensconced in warmth, the tension in Chu Lian quickly dissipated and she fell asleep.</p><br/><p>While in a half-dazed state, she felt someone pulling her into the crook of an arm. Due to her experience from before, Chu Lian hadn\u2019t fallen into a deep sleep, so this action startled her awake.</p><br/><p>The moment she opened her eyes, she was faced with He Changdi, whose eyes were as bright as stars in the night sky.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian turned mute with shock. It took her a moment to take ahold of herself and speak, \u201cYou\u2026 why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, He Changdi had already lifted up the blanket and made his way into the warm and cosy nest. He tightened his grip around her and stared calmly at her blushing face. He let out a gentle laugh, \u201cWere you expecting me to sleep in the study instead of our bedroom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had just lifted up the blanket, it hadn\u2019t completely settled down to cover their bodies yet. The whole area from Chu Lian\u2019s neck to her chest was exposed to his gaze.</p><br/><p>The faint lantern light streaming through the curtains on the bed made her exposed snowy white skin look all the more appetising.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang sized up the nightclothes she seemed to have worn \u2018intentionally\u2019 with a smile. His voice dipped a few notches as he continued, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come, wouldn\u2019t you have worn this robe for nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mind was still hazy after getting woken up. However, his words made her recall that she was still wearing those extremely revealing nightclothes\u2026</p><br/><p>Her cute little cheeks lit up in a furious blush instantly.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hastily explained, \u201cThis was prepared by momo! I didn\u2019t choose this, don\u2019t misunderstand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Servant Gui?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly nodded.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s eyes were already alight with humour, but he put on a dignified face and said, \u201cSenior Servant Gui is indeed an experienced senior servant, it\u2019s about time that I give her a raise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he finished speaking, He Changdi pulled away the blanket covering their body in one go.</p><br/><p>Shyness and anger welled up within Chu Lian. She hadn\u2019t expected such a sudden movement from him and her whole body stiffened up in response. It was only when He Changdi looked all over her body with his gleaming eyes that she finally returned to her senses.</p><br/><p>Realising that she had nothing to cover herself with, Chu Lian sat up in a panic and tried to cover He Sanlang\u2019s eyes with her hands instead.</p><br/><p>When she raised her slender arms, the two soft lumps under her clothes were squeezed together, forming a deep ravine that called out to the beholder.</p><br/><p>The Adam\u2019s apple on He Changdi\u2019s throat trembled as he gulped down his drool. Unfortunately, his eyes were immediately covered in the next second.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s soft hands blocked He Changdi\u2019s invading gaze. Her face was completely flushed as she said furiously, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to look!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t know what to do right now. Wasn\u2019t his little kitten being too difficult? He was probably the most pitiful husband in the whole capital for getting scolded just for looking at his own wife. It left a bitter taste in his heart.</p><br/><p>Now that He Changdi\u2019s vision was obscured, Chu Lian felt safer. Little did she know that she was merely deceiving herself by delaying the inevitable</p><br/><p>It was a rare sight for He Changdi to see her in such a helpless and shy state, so he didn\u2019t stop her and let her cover his eyes as she liked.</p><br/><p>Besides, her hands were so small and she was so tense that she hadn\u2019t noticed that her \u2018blindfold\u2019 had already slipped and he could take in everything.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was laughing endlessly inside. His dear wife was just too cute.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian might have succeeded in blocking He Changdi\u2019s \u2018evil eyes\u2019, but she had no way to counter his \u2018evil claws\u2019.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang reached out to hook her around the waist again and pulled her soft and fragrant body on top of him with barely any effort at all.</p><br/><p>The bedroom was very warm, so He Sanlang wasn\u2019t worried about her feeling cold despite her thin clothes.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian could feel the burning heat of his hand on her waist. She struggled a little in an attempt to break free from his evil claws, but it was pointless as she was imprisoned in his embrace\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

A single candle was lit, its flickering flame causing the shadows on Muxiang\u2019s face to ebb and flow.</p><br/><p>Someone knocked on the door at this time, to which Muxiang answered, \u201cEnter.\u201d</p><br/><p>A maidservant pushed the door open and came into the room. She turned to lock the door before quickly moving to Muxiang.</p><br/><p>Muxiang was seated with her back to the light, dressed in a pretty azure dress embroidered with butterflies, very different from what most maidservants wore. She glanced over at the maidservant, who startled and hurriedly lowered her head, standing to attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying to Miss Muxiang, this servant has already gone out to investigate. Everything happened as we predicted, except for one thing\u2026 When Second Young Master drank that sobering soup, there were no changes in him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muxiang let out a peal of laughter. \u201cHow lucky for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a slight pause, she asked, \u201cHow did Pan Nianzhen enter Eldest Young Master\u2019s room?\u201d</p><br/><p>The maidservant replied in detail, \u201cAfter she drank that \u2018medicine\u2019, she headed straight for Third Young Master\u2019s room. However, Third Young Master had already left, so she entered Second Young Master\u2019s room instead. When Third Young Master went to the inner court, Second Young Master took Third Young Master\u2019s room, leaving her with no choice but to go to Eldest Young Master\u2019s room instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Dalang had drunk too much that night. His days hadn\u2019t been going smoothly either. In his drunkenness, he had mistaken Pan Nianzhen for Madam Zou\u2026</p><br/><p>In order to bolster her courage, Pan Nianzhen had also taken an aphrodisiac. By the time she reached He Changqi\u2019s bedside, her mind had already turned fuzzy, so she didn\u2019t even notice that the man she was with wasn\u2019t He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Through this series of mishaps, the two of them had slept together. Of course, Muxiang had her own part to play in causing this mess.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen had not wanted to take the drug at first. However, her maidservant Pinglu had persuaded her otherwise and she had taken the aphrodisiac. Otherwise, if Pan Nianzhen had been clear-minded, none of this would have happened.</p><br/><p>A mocking curve appeared on Muxiang\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Even a country bumpkin like Pan Nianzhen wanted to have He Changdi?</p><br/><p>She had been practically asking for it.</p><br/><p>This was just a small lesson for her. If there were ever a next time, it would definitely be her last!</p><br/><p>When the maidservant realised that the air around Muxiang had changed, she trembled in fear and bowed her head even lower. She didn\u2019t dare to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue working hard for me. Remember, your mother and younger brother are in my hands. If you\u2019re not obedient, I\u2019ll immediately have my men send their heads straight to your doorstep.\u201d Muxiang didn\u2019t have any particular expression on her face as she threatened the maidservant. The maidservant fell down to her knees in fright and kowtowed repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Muxiang, please spare this servant\u2019s mother and brother. This servant will definitely work hard for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muxiang snorted. \u201cRest assured. As long as you\u2019re good for me, your mother and brother will have happy and carefree lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the shivering maidservant had left, Muxiang stayed seated at the desk for a long moment. The emotions in her impenetrable eyes changed as quickly as the candle\u2019s flame flickered.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the first tendrils of dawn crept over the horizon that she picked up the brush on the table and quickly wrote something on a piece of paper.</p><br/><p>She wrote out a full three pages before she stopped. Then, she blew on the papers to dry the ink, carefully folded them, and finally put them into an envelope, which she tucked into her clothes.</p><br/><p>Muxiang stood up and walked over to the window, the determination to win flashing in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Since the heavens had given her a second chance, she wasn\u2019t going to squander it. This time, she wouldn\u2019t make the wrong choice.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was going to be her husband in this lifetime, just as he had in the previous one.</p><br/><p>As for that imposter in her body, she was definitely going to unmask her one day and have He Changdi see her for who she really was!</p><br/><p>Did that imposter really think that she had turned into House Ying\u2019s Sixth Miss Chu Lian just because she was wearing her face?</p><br/><p>Dream on!</p><br/><p>She was the only one who could be Chu Lian! The pearl hidden in the dust was her alone!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She struggled slightly before she was able to break free from He Changdi\u2019s embrace. Following that, she returned to her seat across from him.</p><br/><p>She could vaguely sense that He Sanlang\u2019s gloomy and depressed mood was related to Xiao Bojian. Perhaps it was due to the way Xiao Bojian had looked at her in Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>But what did that have to do with her? She wasn\u2019t the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019. She had already done her best to distance herself from Xiao Bojian. It wasn\u2019t her fault that she had encountered Xiao Bojian at Prince Wei\u2019s Estate today. He Sanlang was being unreasonable by venting his anger on her.</p><br/><p>Although it was his fault, he couldn\u2019t even bring himself to apologise now? Even if he had his pride, he should also be able to distinguish right from wrong!</p><br/><p>She was usually able to tolerate He Sanlang\u2019s weird temperament. However, she was genuinely angry today.</p><br/><p>There had been some things she wanted to ask him about, but now that the two were locked into a cold war, there was no chance to speak.</p><br/><p>Actually, Chu Lian was rather meek and good-natured. She wouldn\u2019t make trouble for someone unless they provoked her first. Moreover, there weren\u2019t many things that she cared about in the Great Wu Dynasty. Thus, her personality had become even more carefree and easygoing.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had truly provoked Chu Lian\u2019s temper now. On one hand, it was because Chu Lian genuinely cared for him. On the other hand, He Sanlang\u2019s actions had been utterly infuriating.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian leaned against the pillow. Her pair of clear almond-shaped eyes were shut, as if she no longer wanted to see the man across from her. </p><br/><p>There was a gloomy atmosphere inside the small carriage. It was so quiet that even the turning of the axles on the carriage could be heard.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian propped her head on one arm and closed her eyes. It was hard to tell if she had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>He Changdi kept his eyes fixed on Chu Lian\u2019s beautiful face. There was an unprecedented sense of regret in his heart. He loosened and tightened his fists. The frustration in his chest built up until his chest felt like it was going to explode.</p><br/><p>He parted his thin lips and took a deep breath. He was about to apologise when the carriage abruptly stopped and Laiyue\u2019s voice sounded from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Master, Third Young Madam, a carriage broke down ahead so the road is blocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi was interrupted by Laiyue just as he was about to speak. Thus, his face immediately became as black as the bottom of a pot. He gritted his teeth and forced out three words, \u201cTake a detour!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, his gaze turned towards Chu Lian, only to see her acting as if nothing had happened. She was still leaning against the pillow with her eyes shut, like she was asleep.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s fragile heart tightened, as if it had just been ruthlessly squeezed.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, Laiyue felt a chill down the back of his neck when he heard his master\u2019s voice. He hunkered into his shoulders, lifted the reins, and was about to order the guards to take a detour. </p><br/><p>However, before the carriage had even moved, Laiyue noticed a familiar figure.</p><br/><p>A troubled expression appeared on his face. He could more or less guess that Third Young Master and Madam were probably fighting. However, he couldn\u2019t pretend not to see the person that had just gotten out of the carriage in front of them. Thus, he mustered up some courage to report, \u201cThird Young Master, the person in the carriage before us is the Second Master of House Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019s\u2019 father, Chu Qizheng!</p><br/><p>He Changdi couldn\u2019t just take a detour now, since he now knew that it was his father-in-law\u2019s carriage that had broken down in the middle of the road.</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian wasn\u2019t treated well during her maiden days in House Ying, Chu Qizheng was still her biological father. He was the person who had given her life.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian, who had been resting, also opened her eyes now.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t look at He Changdi and turned her head towards the waiting Laiyue outside. She instructed, \u201cInvite Second Master to come sit in our carriage.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

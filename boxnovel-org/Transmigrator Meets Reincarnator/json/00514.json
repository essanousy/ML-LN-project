After serving the Chengping Emperor for so many years, he understood that the Emperor wasn\u2019t actually trying to ask him for advice. The Emperor had likely already come to a decision in his mind.</p><br/><p>The question was entirely rhetorical.</p><br/><p>As expected, after a few minutes, the Emperor ordered, \u201cCall Yang Yanfeng in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty, this servant will go immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the whole fiasco with Miaozhen, everyone, including Dalang, Matriarch He and Countess Jing\u2019an, were in agreement with the main branch\u2019s divorce.</p><br/><p>On the next day, House Jing\u2019an sent a notice to House Dingyuan.</p><br/><p>They had already prepared the divorce papers with the relevant authorities the day before. The only step remaining was for Madam Zou to pack up her dowry and leave the estate.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou was the eldest daughter of the second branch of House Dingyuan. While she was a true noble lady, old Marquis Dingyuan was already getting on in age and the main branch of House Dingyuan was in charge now.</p><br/><p>Once old Marquis Dingyuan passed on and the main branch succeeded the title of marquis, the second branch would be cast out of the estate. The second branch\u2019s influence would only deteriorate from then on.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was now trusted by the Emperor and he held the title of marquis. The second branch of House Dingyuan could no longer match up to House Jing\u2019an.</p><br/><p>Even though Madam Zou had been divorced, the second branch of House Dingyuan didn\u2019t dare to make any comments. Furthermore, this had all been Madam Zou\u2019s own doing.</p><br/><p>As much as Madam Zou\u2019s mother wanted to reprimand her daughter, since she had already gotten divorced by her husband, there was nothing else to say!</p><br/><p>Since she couldn\u2019t do anything to her daughter, Madam Zou\u2019s mother, the Second Madam of House Dingyuan, could only help her daughter pack up her dowry.</p><br/><p>Luckily her daughter hadn\u2019t been a complete idiot. After so many years, her dowry hadn\u2019t decreased one bit. Conversely, it had actually grown much larger.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou had been in charge of the household for so many years. Of course she had dipped her hands into the public funds from time to time.</p><br/><p>Once Madam Zou\u2019s dowry had been taken out from the storehouses, the amount of silver as well as the properties belonging to the estate had actually been halved!</p><br/><p>Madam Zou took her divorce papers and returned home to the Dingyuan Estate with Second Madam richer than before.</p><br/><p>While this was what the He Family had agreed on, there wasn\u2019t any hint of a smile on Matriarch He\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>In the warm room of Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He sat on the hearth bed. Although it was already early spring, the winter chill still hung in the air in the capital. Matriarch He\u2019s body was weak to start with, so she couldn\u2019t bear to be out in the cold. The fires warming the hearth bed and the walls had never stopped.</p><br/><p>He Ying and her daughter, Pan Nianzhen, were keeping the matriarch company in that room as warm as spring.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was squatting by the matriarch\u2019s side and kneading her legs while He Ying was flipping through some account books on the other.</p><br/><p>The matriarch\u2019s eyes were slightly shut. She breathed a sigh of comfort before opening her eyes again, \u201cYou\u2019re getting better at this, Miss Zhen. My old bones are feeling more comfortable thanks to your massage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen blinked her eyes bashfully and smiled, \u201cGrandmother, as long as it\u2019s good for your health, I won\u2019t mind serving you like this forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch reached out to stroke Pan Nianzhen\u2019s smooth locks, \u201cGrandmother can\u2019t bear to tire you out so. Alright, your hands must be sore from massaging me for so long. Go and take a rest at the side. There are some new confections on that table that the kitchen sent over this morning. Why don\u2019t you have a taste and see if you like them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll massage Grandmother for a while longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen\u2019s actions and words had completely won over Matriarch He\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>He Ying secretly sent a look at her daughter, indicating that she had done well.</p><br/><p>A wave of gratitude washed over Matriarch He\u2019s heart. Only her real daughter and granddaughter would treat her so well. They weren\u2019t at all like those granddaughters-in-law she had. Although they had married into this house, they had grown up in other houses after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old woman regrets not bringing the two of you back to the capital earlier. Otherwise, Miss Zhen\u2019s marriage wouldn\u2019t be delayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was the same age as Chu Lian and she had turned sixteen over the New Year. Since she hadn\u2019t been engaged yet, it was indeed a little late for her.</p><br/><p>He Ying smiled, \u201cMother, you don\u2019t have to blame yourself. We\u2019re fine as long as we know that we\u2019re in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch feigned an angry glare at her, \u201cYou silly girl. What are you saying? You should know better at your age! I gave birth to you myself, why would I not have you in my heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, when He Ying smiled again, a satisfied glint flashed across her eyes as she lowered her head.</p><br/><p>In a short moment, He Ying handed the account book over to Matriarch He with a frown, \u201cMother, take a look at these accounts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s health was failing and she didn\u2019t have as much vigour as before. Although the household management rights were in her hands, she hadn\u2019t been able to work on the household at all. Most of the work had been given to her handmaid, Muxiang, while another portion had been handed over to Senior Servant Liu. He Ying was now the one looking over ost of the accounts.</p><br/><p>Her eyesight had become blurry over the past two years, so she couldn\u2019t quite see the fine words on the accounts now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Matriarch He took the book and squinted hard. It took her some effort before she could finally see the words clearly.</p><br/><p>Once she read the writing on the book, her eyes widened in shock. \u201cThat Madam Zou! I shouldn\u2019t have left her in charge of the household back then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Half of the money and properties of the estate had actually been taken away!</p><br/><p>That was a whole half of the assets under the Jing\u2019an Estate!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

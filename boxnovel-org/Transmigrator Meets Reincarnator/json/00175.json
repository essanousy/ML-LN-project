She was a titled noble madam now, so she didn\u2019t need to make any bigger gestures of respect towards them.</p><br/><p>Miss Su invited Chu Lian into Jinshi Pavilion. In a abnormal display of behaviour, Miss Yuan walked close to Chu Lian\u2019s side and bumped Wenlan away before grabbing onto Chu Lian\u2019s arms and calling her \u2018Sixth Sister\u2019.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian felt goosebumps rising all over her body thanks to Miss Yuan\u2019s overly intimate tone. Her gaze landed on Miss Yuan\u2019s hands wrapped around her left arm, and she didn\u2019t bother hiding the disgust she felt in her eyes. Miss Yuan\u2019s gaze met hers, but she acted as if she hadn\u2019t noticed how annoyed she was. Conversely, she acted as if they were best friends, flattering her with, \u201cSixth Sister, we heard about your noble title! We just didn\u2019t have the time to visit you in the Jing\u2019an Estate to congratulate you. You won\u2019t blame this sister, would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian snorted inwardly. If House Ying really cared about this matter, then they would have made it known to her, instead of waiting for Miss Yuan to mention it now after they had ran into each other.</p><br/><p>Although it was rare to get the Honoured Lady title, it was just a low-ranking title without any imperial privilege. It wouldn\u2019t affect the court a single bit. To House Ying, she was no longer part of their family once she got married. Her parents didn\u2019t care about her either, so it was normal to receive such cold treatment from them. Luckily, she wasn\u2019t the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019, so this was completely fine to her.</p><br/><p>What was there to complain about? She had more freedom now than they would\u2019ve ever given her back there!</p><br/><p>Since House Ying had drawn the lines between them, they would have to think again if they wanted to make use of their connection in the future!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian really didn\u2019t want to play nice with them at all, but they were out in public now so she had to care about keeping up House Jing\u2019an\u2019s reputation.</p><br/><p>She said with good temper, \u201cI won\u2019t blame you, it\u2019s just a small matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan rolled her eyes, and a corner of her mouth hooked up. Her expression practically screamed, \u2018At least you\u2019re smart enough to realise that\u2019. Wenqing almost choked on her anger upon seeing that expression. Her hands balled into fists as she felt outrage on behalf of her master.</p><br/><p>Miss Su was about two steps in front of them as she listened to their conversation. Her brows drew together in a frown. Afraid that Miss Yuan would chase Chu Lian away with her provocation, she quickly tried to smooth out the tense atmosphere. \u201cSixth Sister, have you come to Jinshi Pavilion to pick out some accessories as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>By this time, the Ying sisters had reached Jinshi Pavilion\u2019s main hall.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to let them know that she was here to pick out a birthday present for Countess Jing\u2019an, so she casually nodded.</p><br/><p>Miss Su\u2019s eyes darkened a little. Ever since the incident at the Dingyuan Estate, she could feel the distance that Chu Lian was putting between her, Madam Rong, and the whole of House Ying.</p><br/><p>Back at the Dingyuan Estate, she hadn\u2019t jumped out to support Chu Lian at the first hint of something wrong, and she had always felt guilty over it. Seeing Chu Lian\u2019s attitude towards them, she dropped the conversation.</p><br/><p>The main hall of Jinshi Pavilion was decorated elegantly and lavishly. There were small rest areas with tables, chairs, and incense burners behind the screens of the main hall for the noble madams and ladies to rest. There was even a tea room in the building in the back.</p><br/><p>When the four ladies sat down, maidservants came up to serve them sencha. The same manager came up to serve them personally.</p><br/><p>Miss Fu\u2019s eyes glanced over Chu Lian\u2019s outfit and a tinge of disdain filled her expression. The three branches of House Ying had never been at peace with each other. Even if Chu Lian had married out of House Ying, she was still a lady from the second branch. From Miss Fu\u2019s perspective, she and Miss Yuan were on the same boat. Now that the chance had fallen into her lap, how could Miss Fu not make use of it?</p><br/><p>Miss Fu faked envy as she looked at Chu Lian. \u201cIt was really a matter of pride for our House Ying when Sixth Sister received that personal title from the Emperor! Grandmother even praised Sixth Sister in front of me two days ago! It even made me a little jealous. Grandmother also said that the imperial family usually bestows material awards when the Emperor personally gives out an Honoured Lady title! I heard that it\u2019s usually at least a few hundred taels of gold, and that\u2019s not counting the number of dresses and accessories you must have received! I\u2019m really quite envious of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Su hadn\u2019t expected Miss Fu to have brought that topic up. She shot a warning look at Miss Fu.</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan\u2019s eyes abruptly lit up with greed before it was quickly replaced with jealousy and unhappiness.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian remained unmoved. She simply continued watching the ladies before her with wide eyes, inwardly wanting to laugh. Miss Fu hadn\u2019t even done her research before trying to make up this lie. The original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 had probably met the old madam of House Ying maybe twice a year at most. Any servant in the Ying Estate knew that the old madam didn\u2019t like this daughter from the second branch at all. How could she have possibly done something so out-of-character as praising her? Also, getting a reward of a few hundred gold taels from a measly Honoured Lady title? Did she think that the imperial treasury was a mountain of gold and silver?</p><br/><p>Miss Fu\u2019s words were just too fantastical. She was probably only able to hoodwink the narrow minded Miss Yuan. Even Jinshi Pavilion\u2019s manager hadn\u2019t moved at all; she clearly didn\u2019t think much about what Miss Fu had said.</p><br/><p>When Miss Fu finished speaking, she cast a measuring gaze over Chu Lian and Miss Yuan, smirking with bad intentions.</p><br/><p>The single motive she had for saying something like that was to provoke that Eighth Miss, Chu Yuan.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan had clearly gotten hooked. Back then, when they had both been unmarried ladies of House Ying, she had been better at Chu Lian in everything. Food, living standards, even her monthly allowance had been ten taels higher than Chu Lian\u2019s.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian had gotten married, Second Madam had used some underhanded measures to cut the original sum of a thousand taels by half. She had been especially happy back then, because her mother had given her half of the confiscated silver.</p><br/><p>However, things were different now. It was bad enough that Chu Lian had gotten a noble title and a personal name from the Emperor. She had actually gotten that much in rewards? A few hundred taels of gold? How could she hold back her jealousy?</p><br/><p>The plan that she had thought of just now came to mind again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

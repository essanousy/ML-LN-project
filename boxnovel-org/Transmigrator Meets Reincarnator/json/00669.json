He Changdi was incredibly surprised as well.</p><br/><p>At this moment, He Changdi was seated in Prince Jin\u2019s study.</p><br/><p>The two stared at each other in bewilderment. They just couldn\u2019t understand the emperor\u2019s intentions. Could it be that the emperor wanted to raise House Ying up again?</p><br/><p>That wouldn\u2019t be right, a mere bestowal didn\u2019t mean anything. Besides, House Ying didn\u2019t even have any children with talent. Earlier, there had even been a rumour that Chu Lian\u2019s father, House Ying\u2019s Second Master, had been dismissed from office.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin\u2019s azure eyes were filled with doubt. Could it be that his extremely wise father was just having fun causing drama?</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was simply toying with House Ying\u2019s second branch for amusement? Giving them a slap and then handing out some candy? But these candies weren\u2019t even sweet\u2026</p><br/><p>Even the reincarnated He Changdi couldn\u2019t figure out why the emperor had done this.</p><br/><p>After a period of silence, Prince Jin finally spoke, \u201cAh-di, our earnings aren\u2019t enough to cover our expenses anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>They now had assistance from House Sima, but they still had to increase their forces, and they had to compete with Sixth Prince in secret. There were too many avenues where funds were needed, so Prince Jin and He Changdi couldn\u2019t even manage to break even.</p><br/><p>Actually, it was easy for them to acquire funds publicly. With their statuses, there would definitely be rich people who would lend a helping hand.</p><br/><p>However, the situation right now was peculiar. Everything had to be done in secret, and for some matters, it was also better for fewer people to be in the know.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s cool face became increasingly grim.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh-yi, I\u2019ll find a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s eyes deepened. Going by his original plan, it should have been smooth sailing once they secured the silver mine, but there was unexpectedly a slip-up with acquiring the mine!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will send more people to investigate.\u201d As he spoke, Prince Jin handed a letter over to He Changdi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heiyu Army sent this.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no big deal for him to read Prince Jin\u2019s letters, so He Changdi quickly opened the letter and read its contents. What he saw put a slight smile on his face, \u201cXiao Wujing is truly unscrupulous! He even managed to put a person like Wei Fengzi under his control!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh-di, I think we should warn Father about this. I\u2019m afraid Xiao Bojian is plotting something.\u201d Prince Jin was slightly worried.</p><br/><p>Wei Fengzi was Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s younger sister. They had been born from the same mother and she was Minister Kong\u2019s wife.</p><br/><p>This was something that had they had to think through carefully.</p><br/><p>He Changdi looked out of the window as the skies slowly darkened. It was getting late.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh-yi, it\u2019s late now, I have to go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that said, He Changdi had already stood up and was walking towards the exit.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin scoffed, and sourly replied, \u201cLook at how smug you\u2019ve gotten since Jinyi got pregnant. You\u2019ve probably been staying by her side twenty-four hours a day, right? Even if you don\u2019t mind, Jinyi would be annoyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s normally frozen face had changed to something more gentle. There was a warm smile on his face. He hadn\u2019t hid the news of Chu Lian\u2019s pregnancy from his best friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you jealous, Ah-yi? Just get General Sima to make a child for you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting teased right back by his friend, the aloof and proud Prince Jin actually blushed.</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan and Royal Prince Shou\u2019s wedding was to be held in two months.</p><br/><p>After the marriage had been bestowed by imperial decree, House Ying started talks with Prince Yongkang over the details of the marriage.</p><br/><p>After the initial buzz of gossip, it was as if the whole capital had gone into absolute silence. In the following month, everything went as smooth as silk. Chu Lian\u2019s restaurant on Zhuque Avenue had already opened.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had thought of the new restaurant\u2019s name herself, \u2018Dejufeng\u2019. Just like the old Guilin Restaurant, this place was separated into inner and outer courts. However, there was now an extra floor of private rooms added on the third floor of the building in the front.</p><br/><p>A small stage had been built to the side of the main hall on the ground floor. Dejufeng had a collaboration with Pear Garden to have their actors come over to perform a show every day at noon and three o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>As for what the actors would perform, the manager would either set the songs in advance, or allow guests who were having their meal there to pay for a song they wanted.</p><br/><p>This time, there wasn\u2019t as much fanfare to Dejufeng\u2019s opening as when Guilin Restaurant had opened.</p><br/><p>On the opening day, all they had done was to light up two strings of firecrackers and send gifts to the neighbouring shops, and that was it! They were open for business.</p><br/><p>When they opened in such a subdued manner, everyone around them was wondering how this mysterious Dejufeng Restaurant was going to end up. However, moments later, carriage after carriage stopped in front of Dejufeng\u2019s entrance, causing the eyes of those who had been secretly paying attention to open wide.</p><br/><p>Amongst the people who were watching was De\u2019an Restaurant\u2019s Manager Wang.</p><br/><p>Manager Wang stood in the private room on the second floor of his restaurant, with the old bookkeeper who had worked with him for many years by his side.</p><br/><p>Manager Wang had his hands clasped behind his back as he squinted past the half-open window, \u201cJust who is backing Dejufeng? I\u2019ve long heard that Old Lin\u2019s store was bought over by a noble, but when I asked him, the old fogey refused to reveal their identity.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bookkeeper\u2019s gaze landed on Dejufeng\u2019s entrance.</p><br/><p>The newly opened restaurant didn\u2019t look any different from before, it seemed like all that changed was its sign board and nothing else.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

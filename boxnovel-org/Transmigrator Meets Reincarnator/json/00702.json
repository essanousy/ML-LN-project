She cried out once more, and lost all her strength again.</p><br/><p>When Physician Li saw that she was about to pass out again, her face paled along with Chu Lian\u2019s, \u201cMadam, Madam, wake up! We can see the baby\u2019s head now! You have to push a little harder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian swallowed the saliva that had gathered in her mouth. Her voice had gotten hoarse from her screaming, \u201cI don\u2019t have any more strength left\u2026 I can\u2019t do it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi ignored the shocked looks sent his way from the senior servants. He came right over to the bed and pulled Chu Lian\u2019s hand away from clutching tightly at the blankets.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, Lian\u2019er, I\u2019m here now. Wake up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the voice of the person she had been waiting for, Chu Lian\u2019s mind finally cleared a little. When she turned and looked at He Changdi, a sense of grievance fell upon her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Changdi, I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t give birth to our child\u2026 I don\u2019t have any strength left\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That frail tone from his wife was like a hand squeezing hard on He Changdi\u2019s heart. All of his emotions were laid bare on his cool and handsome as he reached out to stroke Chu Lian\u2019s sweat-covered face, \u201cLian\u2019er, don\u2019t give up! I\u2019ll stay by your side and watch as our child is born! Once he comes out, I\u2019ll scold him for you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>For some people, when they were suffering, their loved ones\u2019 reassurance might bring tears instead.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was one of those. When she saw that He Changdi had come to her side, the melancholy stored in her heart all came flooding out at once. Tears streaked uncontrollably down her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Changdi\u2026 But\u2026 It hurts, it hurts like I\u2019m about to di-\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her words, He Changdi pressed two fingers to her lips, \u201cLian\u2019er, don\u2019t say that. What did you promise me last time? You said that you would be with me forever, have you forgotten already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pressed her lips together, enduring the immense pain her body was in to focus her gaze on the man before her.</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t wait for her reply and put his arm in front of Chu Lian\u2019s lips, \u201cLian\u2019er, be good for me. Listen to the midwife. If it hurts, just bite me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if He Changdi\u2019s sudden arrival had returned her courage, Chu Lian shut her eyes briefly and had a short break. Finally, she complied with the midwife\u2019s instructions and pushed even harder. Even so, the birth was hard. Under the protection of Physician Li, Chu Lian still fainted once more. After that, they gave her the medicinal soup that Great Doctor Miao had already prepared.</p><br/><p>After going through a whole night of hellish torture, when the first tendrils of daylight showed over the horizon, the little baby in Chu Lian\u2019s belly safely arrived in the world.</p><br/><p>The moment she heard the baby\u2019s hearty cries, Chu Lian finally drifted off to sleep out of exhaustion.</p><br/><p>Senior Servants Gui and Zhong both rejoiced inwardly upon seeing the lower half of the newborn baby.</p><br/><p>It was a young master!</p><br/><p>The midwife quickly brought the newborn over to a basin nearby and washed him clean, before bundling him into a large red blanket. When all was done, she handed over the little fellow to Senior Servant Gui to hold.</p><br/><p>Wenqing had already gone out to report the good news.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui brought their young master over to He Changdi, who was still sitting by the bedside, and exclaimed happily, \u201cMaster, it\u2019s a young heir! Congratulations, Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>The midwife and maidservants in the room chimed in with their own congratulations.</p><br/><p>However, He Changdi was still watching the sound asleep Chu Lian with a dark expression. There were still strands of hair stuck to her sweaty face, so he lovingly helped her to tuck them back behind her ear.</p><br/><p>His response to Senior Servant\u2019s Gui was a cold one, \u201cBring the child out to his nursemaid. Get Great Doctor Miao to come in and look after Lian\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>The midwife had helped plenty of noblewomen give birth. This was her very first time seeing a father who only cared for his wife and didn\u2019t even glance at their child.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the child was a boy! If it had been any other man, they would have been elated beyond belief.</p><br/><p>Senior Servants Gui and Zhong muttered inwardly to themselves. Their young heir was so cute, but his father didn\u2019t even want to look at him! He didn\u2019t have any taste at all. However, they didn\u2019t\u2019 dare to disobey orders in front of He Changdi.</p><br/><p>The two senior servants could only carry the new heir out to find his nursemaid.</p><br/><p>He Changdi watched as Great Doctor Miao took Chu Lian\u2019s pulse. The moment the doctor put down Chu Lian\u2019s wrist, he hurriedly asked, \u201cUncle Miao, how is Lian\u2019er\u2019s body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao had seen how He Changdi only had eyes for Chu Lian and her health, he hadn\u2019t even glanced at his own child after becoming a father for the first time. Since he was satisfied with He Changdi\u2019s attitude, he didn\u2019t try to scare him.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, Marquis. She\u2019s only sleeping because she used up too much strength. There won\u2019t be any negative effects from this, especially if she eats a few rounds of my special medicine. However, since she\u2019s so young and her body suffered a bout of ill health previously, I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t be able to feed the child normally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao\u2019s meaning was clear. Chu Lian wasn\u2019t allowed to breastfeed her child. However, since they had hired two nursemaids, they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the heir going hungry.</p><br/><p>He Changdi stood up to see Great Doctor Miao out of the room. When Great Doctor Miao got up, he caught sight of He Changdi\u2019s rolled up sleeve which exposed the bites covering his forearm. The bites were so deep that they were bleeding. It was clear that those had been made by Chu Lian during the birth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

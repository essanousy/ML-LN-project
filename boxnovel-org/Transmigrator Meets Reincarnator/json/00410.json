He felt like there was a double meaning to the word \u2018care\u2019, especially after he had experienced more intimate contact with his wife\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, the tips of He Sanlang\u2019s ears started turning a little red.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo and the others didn\u2019t notice this little detail. At most, they just thought that He Sanlang\u2019s expression seemed slightly awkward.</p><br/><p>However, they weren\u2019t bothered about such minute changes amongst brothers.</p><br/><p>The men sat down at the center of the tent.</p><br/><p>As He Changdi removed his sword from his waist, Zhang Mai glanced at him and asked, \u201cHave you found the culprit behind this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang looked at his brothers and said a single name.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bojian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although his tone hadn\u2019t changed, Captain Guo was able to sense the deep hatred for the man in his heart.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai furrowed his brows. His surprise showed in his voice as he asked, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this name before, how is he involved in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo\u2019s home was in the capital and he exchanged letters with his wife and children regularly, so he knew a little more about the news in the capital compared to Zhang Mai. He frowned as well, \u201cThat person is this year\u2019s top scholar for the imperial examinations. His good name has spread through the whole city. He\u2019s Old Duke Ying\u2019s disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the mention of Duke Ying came up, Captain Guo shot a meaningful look at He Changdi as his expression turned a little strange.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu was lying on his bed. His lips tilted to one side, \u201cThat old man Duke Ying must be really blind. He\u2019s raised a feral wolf by his side without knowing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young Xiao Hongyu had somehow stumbled upon the truth of it.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang sat down and poured himself a cup of tea. After holding up the cup and taking a small sip, his brows drew together and set down the cup. It was clear he didn\u2019t like the mixed taste of sencha. He licked his lips and realised that Chu Lian\u2019s sickly sweet honey water was actually better than sencha.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough House Ying is linked to me in marriage, we\u2019re not close to House Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had put it nicely. Not only were they not close to House Ying, Chu Lian probably would never want to go back.</p><br/><p>He Changdi brought his fingers together and touched the green Hetian jade ring on his right thumb before continuing, \u201cXiao Bojian is currently the secretary of the northwestern army encamped in Su City.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Captain Guo and Zhang Mai\u2019s expressions both changed.</p><br/><p>Surprise and bewilderment showed on their faces. They had never expected a newly minted top scholar to have climbed his way up the ranks in court so quickly!</p><br/><p>When Captain Guo noticed the darkness swirling in He Changdi\u2019s eyes, he startled a little and held down Sanlang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe have to think about this in the long term, don\u2019t be rash.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang looked helplessly at his two older brothers, \u201cBrother Guo, Brother Zhang, don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m not an impulsive person.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his past life, he had already suffered enough torture under the hands of that adulterous couple. How would he fall for their tricks once again? Once bitten, twice shy, but he had already been bitten more than just once!</p><br/><p>Although He Changdi was young, even Great General Qian placed utmost trust in him, let alone his band of brothers.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai patted He Changdi\u2019s shoulder in comfort. However, he added on, \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang looked up at Zhang Mai in slight confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know this yet since you just came back to camp, but the traitor in our camp has been caught. It was Gao Zhangwei.\u201d Zhang Mai\u2019s expression was grave, as were his words.</p><br/><p>Although Gao Zhangwei didn\u2019t get along with their Right Wing Army and constantly went against them in the northern border troops, conflict within an army was one thing and selling out their country was another.</p><br/><p>Even if they fought within the army ranks, there wouldn\u2019t be any grudges left once one side won. However, if they betrayed the entire army by colluding with the enemy, the entire army would look down on them.</p><br/><p>Who could have expected Gao Zhangwei to have done such a thing?!</p><br/><p>Great General Qian was also both shocked and angry. He immediately decided to have Gao Zhangwei executed under the flagpoles of the border camp.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was a little startled. He remembered that Gao Zhangwei\u2019s collusion with the enemy hadn\u2019t been discovered in his past life. Not only that, he had even earned a lot of merit from this war and had later been personally titled General Changping by the Emperor himself. He had also been awarded a noble rank along with the title.</p><br/><p>Thoughts swirled in He Sanlang\u2019s eyes. Although Gao Zhangwei was narrow-minded, he didn\u2019t have much courage to do anything. If he had really sent secret military information to the Tuhuns, then there had to be a mastermind behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe execution will be held tomorrow. In order to send a warning to the whole army, the general will be doing the execution himself in front of the two wings and the female army. We have to be present as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>On this night, everyone was able to set aside the worries in their hearts to have a good night\u2019s rest. Even the burdened He Sanlang was no exception.</p><br/><p>Since the Tuhun army had already been defeated, it wasn\u2019t too appropriate for Chu Lian to continue staying in the camp. The next morning, He Changdi escorted her back to Liangzhou City\u2019s He Estate, along with his subordinates and House Jing\u2019an\u2019s private soldiers.</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t sit in the warm pen together with Chu Lian this time, and stayed on horseback next to the snowboat instead.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was following right behind him, his old face wrinkled up. He stared at He Changdi for a long time with his lips parted and a conflicted expression. In the end, he wasn\u2019t able to say a single word.</p><br/><p>He Changdi cast a neutral glance at him before speaking, \u201cUncle Mo, if you think that you shouldn\u2019t speak up, then don\u2019t speak at all. Keep your words to yourself forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was startled by the frank words and hurriedly chased up to He Changdi on his horse. He looked around them first before asking He Sanlang in a low tone, \u201cThird Young Master, when Third Young Madam was taken away\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Each of them was tall and their bodies seemed to brim with strength thanks to their years of martial arts training. Adding on their clean faces, just like Tang Yan\u2019s, the group of men made for a nice spectacle.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t there a saying that went something like, women put on makeup to show respect to others? These men before her had taken the time to clean up and dress well, and that was a similar form of respect. Chu Lian suddenly felt that the customs of the Great Wu Dynasty weren\u2019t too bad.</p><br/><p>She praised them unreservedly, \u201cSir Tang is quite the spectacle today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who didn\u2019t like praise? Even Tang Yan wasn\u2019t exempt from this. On the way here, Tang Yan had already become familiar with Chu Lian. He understood that there was no other meaning to her words and that she was purely praising him for his looks.</p><br/><p>He was already in a good mood. The full wash up he had done this morning was the first time he had taken a bath this whole trip. Washing off all the dirt and detritus of a long journey could always make anyone feel refreshed. Getting this unexpected praise lifted up his mood by a bit more.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan was about to speak up when a cold snort sounded from the entrance. Following that, a low, magnetic and cool voice resounded in the room, practically forming icicles, \u201cWhat a way with words you have, Lian\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the voice finished speaking, Chu Lian stared at the entrance in astonishment. He Changdi was standing there stiffly behind the felt curtain covering the entrance. Behind him was the anxious yet helpless Wenlan.</p><br/><p>More than half of his face was covered by his thick facial hair, so she couldn\u2019t tell what his expression was like. However, massive waves seemed to be rippling in those narrow eyes of his. Chu Lian felt as if she might be overcome by one of this waves in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian frowned as she stared at him. His appearance at this time was completely out of her expectations.</p><br/><p>There were a few snowflakes on He Sanlang\u2019s shoulders and his tied up hair was a little messy. His tough armour was looking a little worn out and dirty as well. His thick army boots were covered in mud and snow. He Changdi\u2019s wretched appearance was a huge contrast when set against the clean and neat appearance of Tang Yan and his group.</p><br/><p>Just now, if Wenlan hadn\u2019t noticed the huge beard that had become his trademark, she might not have realised that this was her very own master.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stood up and walked slowly in He Sanlang\u2019s direction. \u201cWhy have you come at this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just a normal question, but it sounded like disdain for his presence to He Sanlang\u2019s ears. His expression turned even darker.</p><br/><p>The corner of his lips tugged downwards, \u201cWhat? Lian\u2019er doesn\u2019t welcome Husband back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tilted her head to one side and looked carefully at He Changdi. She could detect that trace of unhappiness in He Sanlang\u2019s words. Was this guy going on a bend again? If she remembered correctly, they hadn\u2019t even met these few days. She couldn\u2019t possibly have made him mad again, right?</p><br/><p>Hadn\u2019t they been just fine the last time when he had left?</p><br/><p>However, Chu Lian was already completely used to He Sanlang\u2019s bipolar attitude. This time, her emotions remained unchanged. When she heard his words, she only smiled and didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan stood up at this time and greeted He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Even though there was practically no relation between He Sanlang and Tang Yan and they were acquaintances at most, when He Changdi looked at the bare-faced and neatly dressed Tang Yan at this moment, a strange feeling of dissatisfaction rose in his heart.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan hadn\u2019t interacted much with He Changdi and they had only met at Prince Jin\u2019s estate once or twice.</p><br/><p>He generously explained the reason he had come to find Chu Lian today to He Sanlang.</p><br/><p>He Changdi took in a quick breath to calm his emotions and nodded in acknowledgement. He sat down assuredly at the table. At the moment he sat down, he gritted his teeth forcefully to bear with the pain on his buttocks.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t mind at all. Since the last time when she had inadvertently overheard Mo Chenggui\u2019s words, she had been absent minded these few days. Now that she was finally meeting him again, the attention that she had originally placed on Tang Yan and Prince Jin\u2019s guards was completely drawn to him. She wanted to ask He Sanlang whether he had been punished or not, but with Tang Yan still around, it wasn\u2019t the right time for her to ask. She could only sit at the table together with He Changdi.</p><br/><p>At this time, Wenqing came in with breakfast. To her surprise, Third Young Master had come.</p><br/><p>After she bobbed in greeting, she placed the food on the table. Today\u2019s breakfast was fried spring rolls and shredded chicken and mushroom porridge.</p><br/><p>When Tang Yan saw the food, his eyes lit up. He picked up a pair of chopsticks. \u201cHonoured Lady, Third Young Master He, I won\u2019t stand on ceremony with you then. I\u2019ll start first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he was done speaking, he immediately started wolfing down food.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian picked up her own spoon and lowered her head to have a sip of porridge. She was about to ask whether He Changdi had had breakfast yet, but in the next second, the spoon in her hands was stolen by him.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian could only watch as that fellow used her own spoon, right before her very eyes, and dug a up a spoonful of porridge from her bowl and stuffed it into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was absolutely stunned. That\u2026 that He Sanlang! That was her breakfast! Wasn\u2019t he being overly familiar with her?</p><br/><p>She glared at him with wide eyes, completely forgetting to speak. Her eyes were filled with the scene of He Changdi gulping down her breakfast voraciously. His movements were even faster than Tang Yan\u2019s. When she looked at how the two men eating, she was seriously questioning whether they were really nobles from the capital.</p><br/><p>It was Wenqing who reacted first. \u201cThird Young Madam, please wait. This servant will get another bowl for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pursed her lips and could only nod.</p><br/><p>By the time Chu Lian\u2019s new bowl of porridge was served up, the spring rolls on the table had disappeared into thin air\u2026</p><br/><p>He Sanlang kept count inwardly. He had eaten one more spring roll than Tang Yan. With that result, his mood became much better. He set down his chopsticks and looked at Tang Yan.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan had already sensed He Changdi\u2019s disdain towards him by now. Since he had already eaten the gourmet food he had come for, there was no other reason for him to stay. Thus, he bid them goodbye. \u201cThird Young Master He, Honoured Lady, why don\u2019t you discuss it between yourselves first? Once you\u2019ve decided, just send someone to inform this subordinate.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

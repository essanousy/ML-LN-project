How lucky that Second Brother had come back to the estate at the right time. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have been good if Royal Princess Duanjia had really fallen.</p><br/><p>She instructed Wenqing and Wenlan to bring Royal Princess Duanjia to another room to wash up a little and change out of her clothes before the two of them sat down to have breakfast.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia pouted. \u201cChu Liu, I missed the chance to watch you cook for me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian rolled her eyes speechlessly. \u201cPrincess, isn\u2019t it good enough if you get to eat the results of my cooking? Why do you want to watch me cook? Don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re trying to learn how to cook yourself? If you want to learn how to cook, it\u2019s easy enough. I\u2019ll just write out some of my recipes for you and you can get one of your estate\u2019s cooks to teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia quickly shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to learn how to cook. That\u2019s too troublesome. If I want to eat something good, I\u2019ll just come look for you. Anyway, I can come at any time and you\u2019ll cook for me regardless, right, Chu Liu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why do you want to watch me cook?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious! I want to see how you made all these delicacies step by step.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know what to say at all about Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s strange liking.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia suddenly reached out with her chopsticks and pointed at the \u2018crystal buns\u2019 and \u2018crystal dumplings\u2019 in front of her. \u201cChu Liu, you haven\u2019t made these for He Sanlang to eat before, have you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wasn\u2019t sure why Royal Princess Duanjia had suddenly asked such a question, but she shook her head honestly.</p><br/><p>Strictly speaking, it seemed like He Changdi had only eaten her wontons and scallion pancakes before? Uh\u2026 and that beef jerky she had sent.</p><br/><p>Now that she thought about it, he really hadn\u2019t eaten much of her cooking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Royal Princess Duanjia suddenly burst out into laughter, even holding onto her stomach.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tapped the jade bowl in front of her. \u201cPrincess, are you going to eat or not? If you\u2019re not going to eat this, I\u2019ll let the maidservants clear it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia quickly covered the bowl full of chicken porridge protectively and shook her head. \u201cNo, don\u2019t clear it! I haven\u2019t even eaten enough! Chu Liu, I just suddenly thought that He Sanlang is rather pitiful, hahaha! He actually hasn\u2019t tasted such delicious buns before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glanced at Royal Princess Duanjia helplessly. She was clearly reveling in someone else\u2019s misfortune. Who would laugh like that if they were pitying others\u2019 circumstances?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until Royal Princess Duanjia had filled up her tummy that she let the maidservants clear away the dishes on the table and ordered two cups of honey water.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia held up the white porcelain teacup with both hands. \u201cChu Liu, the rankings for the autumn examinations are already out. Take a guess at who the top three are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stiffened. She hadn\u2019t expected the rankings to have come out so quickly. When she remembered that Xiao Bojian had been the top scholar for the autumn examinations in the story, her mood turned sour.</p><br/><p>She half-heartedly replied, \u201cScholars from the imperial college?\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia didn\u2019t notice Chu Lian\u2019s sudden change of mood. She nodded and continued, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Other than the second placed scholar, the first and third placed scholars all came from the Imperial College. The top scholar this time is the Imperial College\u2019s Xiao Bojian. Speaking of which, you should know of him. He\u2019s one of your grandfather\u2019s pupils and he\u2019s even been living in the Ying Estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian completely missed whatever Royal Princess Duanjia said after she heard that Xiao Bojian had gotten the first place in the examinations. Her heart seemed to quiver as she thought about the events in the later part of the book. As optimistic as she was, Chu Lian couldn\u2019t help but frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Liu, Chu Liu. What\u2019s wrong? Are you listening to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was dragged back to reality by Royal Princess Duanjia. \u201cAh? What did you say, Your Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia cast a measuring gaze towards Chu Lian. \u201cChu Liu, what\u2019s happened to you? You seem a little absentminded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. My spirit hasn\u2019t been too good these few days, perhaps due to how busy I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia could tell that Chu Lian wasn\u2019t willing to talk about it, so she simply repeated the question she had just asked. \u201cWhat kind of gift did you prepare for Countess Jing\u2019an? When I arrived at Songtao Court just now, a few of your maidservants were chatting and saying that your eldest sister-in-law\u2019s going to give the Countess a hundred-year-old ginseng! He Sanlang isn\u2019t around, so you can\u2019t let her beat you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to compare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, I just don\u2019t like that eldest sister-in-law of yours. Look at how fragile and gentle she\u2019s acting. You must be getting bullied by her often here! This won\u2019t do! I\u2019ll send someone back to my estate to bring a two-hundred-year-old red ginseng over!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiyan\u2019s eyes twitched as she listened to this conversation and she sighed in her heart. With Third Young Madam\u2019s temperament, how could she possibly get bullied? If anyone actually dared to bully her, she would return it eye for eye on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that! I\u2019ve already prepared my gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, Chu Lian sent Xiyan into her room to bring out an accessory case to let Royal Princess Duanjia have a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis headdress is for Princess Wei. Your Highness, help me bring it back to her. I\u2019ll also be giving my mother a pearl headdress, just in a different style and with different materials. However, I personally designed both of these and ordered a master craftsman from Jinshi Pavilion to make them both.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia opened up the case, revealing an elegant pearl headdress within. Its design was novel and exquisite. Even the accessories from the palace couldn\u2019t compare to this. She said sourly, \u201cChu Liu, don\u2019t tell me that my mother has a higher position in your heart than I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. She could only bring out another small box. \u201cHere, I prepared this for you. It\u2019s a pink pearl bracelet, also designed by me. I have a matching bracelet.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only after seeing the bracelet that Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s mood lifted. She immediately put it on her slender wrist and showed it off to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Actually, there wasn\u2019t any special meaning behind Chu Lian\u2019s gifts. She only felt that she had to give them something in return, especially since Princess Wei would bestow some rewards to her each time she visited Prince Wei\u2019s Estate. Princess Wei was her elder too, so it wasn\u2019t good for her to keep receiving gifts from her without an appropriate return gift. It was already pretty late to be giving her a return gift at this time.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei treated her very well. She could even tell that Princess Wei looked at her with the same loving gaze she would look at Royal Princess Duanjia with.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although the capital was large, there was a great number of people occupying the space. As long as someone intentionally tried to spread some news, even the most boring gossip would spread like wildfire.</p><br/><p>The House of Count Jing\u2019an was also a noble house. When ordinary folk had nothing better to do, they enjoyed discussing interesting tidbits like the private affairs of the noble houses during their meals.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, when Chu Lian had received an imperial edict and been conferred the title of Honoured Lady Jinyi, House Jing\u2019an hadn\u2019t hidden the news at all. Chu Lian usually stayed inside the Jing\u2019an Estate without paying attention to what went on outside, so she had no idea that this matter had already spread throughout the capital.</p><br/><p>Although there were many members of the imperial family who were conferred titles, House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam was the first non-imperial family member to receive a personal title in decades, so it was normal for everyone to be surprised.</p><br/><p>In fact, there were also plenty of noble ladies who were looking for an opportunity to meet this Honoured Lady Jinyi as well!</p><br/><p>Due to a mere fifth-ranked Honoured Lady title, Chu Lian had been pushed to the height of gossip. She had practically become famous overnight among the capital\u2019s people.</p><br/><p>These bailiffs weren\u2019t stupid; the leader immediately realised what Chu Lian\u2019s identity was! He glared at Manager Wang, wishing he could split that man\u2019s head open!</p><br/><p>What the hell! And he even called himself a servant of the Jing\u2019an Estate! If he couldn\u2019t even recognize his own master, he deserved whatever punishment came to him!</p><br/><p>The leader\u2019s attitude became even more deferential. He even seemed to be trying to curry favour with the flattering lilt of his tone. \u201cHonoured one, please let this humble one deal with these bad servants who don\u2019t know any better for you, so they don\u2019t spoil your mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s brows furrowed together. She really didn\u2019t like how this head bailiff had changed his attitude towards her so quickly, like he was merely flipping the pages of a book. She indifferently said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I\u2019ll send someone to bring them back to the estate, and have the steward personally punish them.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how terrible this Wang family\u2019s actions had been, they were owned by the matriarch. It wouldn\u2019t be proper to use her title and order the bailiffs to deal with them \u2014 certain things should stay within the family, especially as the matriarch was her elder.</p><br/><p>The leader was rather embarrassed by the rejection, but he had no choice but to keep quiet.</p><br/><p>When they heard what Chu Lian had said, the three servants were all scared out of their wits and knelt on the floor, begging for forgiveness.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to deal with this annoying family, so she ordered the manservants who had come along with her to stuff their mouths and send them to the steward of the estate.</p><br/><p>Wenqing politely sent the bailiffs off.</p><br/><p>Guilin Restaurant\u2019s main hall finally settled into silence again. Only Chu Lian and her party were left.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that she heard footsteps coming from the back. Chu Lian raised her brows. She hadn\u2019t thought that there were still other people inside Guilin Restaurant.</p><br/><p>The curtains in front of the door shifted, revealing a white-haired old man dressed in a rough tunic.</p><br/><p>When the old man lifted his gaze, he was met with Chu Lian\u2019s appraising eyes. He was slightly stunned, but immediately followed with an amiable smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay this old servant ask if you\u2019re the master of this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan exchanged glances, both wearing identically puzzled expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>Wenqing walked up to him and supported him as they walked over to Chu Lian. \u201cOld sir, this is House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam. The matriarch has already handed over this restaurant to Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s eyes immediately lit up, causing his wrinkled face to look like peels of dried tangerines.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s finally hope for Guilin Restaurant! It can be saved!\u201d The old man began to laugh and cry with joy. He used his sleeves to wipe away his tears.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was confused. \u201cOld sir, may I ask your identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man quickly calmed himself down and said, \u201cMy apologies, Third Young Madam, this old servant has been inconsiderate. I am the bookkeeper of Guilin Restaurant\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s surname was also Wang, but he wasn\u2019t related to Manager Wang and his family at all. However, the old man was also a servant originally from the Jing\u2019an Estate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It didn\u2019t matter whether this situation had been planned by Aunt and her daughter or not. What\u2019s done was done, there was no way around it.</p><br/><p>If Grandmother insisted on him marrying Pan Nianzhen, he probably wouldn\u2019t reject.</p><br/><p>Even if it was clear that no happiness would come out of their marriage, he wouldn\u2019t reject it.</p><br/><p>It seemed like He Changqi had already given up and was only trying to please others. This course of action was extremely damaging to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you persuade Eldest Brother?\u201d Chu Lian suggested.</p><br/><p>He Changdi shook his head again.</p><br/><p>As the three brothers had grown up together, He Changdi knew his eldest brother very well despite their age gap of ten years.</p><br/><p>As the eldest son of the family, He Changdi had been indoctrinated at a young age to become a pillar for the family and to take care of his brothers. He had an upright and responsible personality. He had to assume filial duties on behalf of his brothers as the eldest. In the Great Wu Dynasty, filial piety was a core value of the country, so in normal situations, most children would never go against the wishes and decisions of their parents.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was easy to imagine the pressure that Dalang was under when faced with Matriarch He, who was his grandmother</p><br/><p>Although He Sanlang had some measure of power in the household, he was still one of the youngest in the family and he didn\u2019t hold any authority towards his brother. Even if he were to persuade him sincerely, He Dalang simply wouldn\u2019t listen.</p><br/><p>The only person who could overturn the decisions of the matriarch and He Changqi would be his father, Count Jing\u2019an.</p><br/><p>Hearing He Sanlang\u2019s explanation, Chu Lian hastily interjected, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Father is returning soon? Let\u2019s write a letter to notify him about this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s suggestion made sense to him. He Changdi quickly got up, walked to the writing desk, and begun writing a letter.</p><br/><p>Once the letter hd been sent out by Wenlan, the couple finally relaxed their tense shoulders.</p><br/><p>As long as Count Jing\u2019an managed to return in time, the marriage between He Dalang and Pan Nianzhen wouldn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian and He Changdi then chatted for a little more before having their afternoon nap together.</p><br/><p>Within a room in Qingxi Hall, Pan Nianzhen was lying on the bed. She had already cried to the point of passing out several times.</p><br/><p>When she had been \u2018caught with her pants down\u2019 by He Changdi and Chu Lian this morning, it had felt as if she had been struck by lightning. Her mind had collapsed instantly.</p><br/><p>Until now, she still refused to believe that the person she had mustered up her courage to give up her body to was actually the tall, bear-like He Changqi!</p><br/><p>The prince charming she had been dreaming about turned into a black bear. Pan Nianzhen wanted to slam her head into the wall and kill herself, but she managed to stop herself from doing that with what was left of her rationality.</p><br/><p>Although she hated the situation right now, she didn\u2019t have the courage to hang herself.</p><br/><p>Moments later, He Ying entered.</p><br/><p>Seeing her pale and haggard-looking daughter, she helplessly sighed. She walked up to her daughter and sat by the bedside.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Zhen, Mother arranged everything perfectly for you. How\u2026 how did you make a mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying may have been a selfish shrew, but she treated her only daughter well. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have groomed Pan Nianzhen into what she was.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen didn\u2019t dare to tell her mother the truth now. How could she reveal that she hadn\u2019t intended to follow the plan at all?</p><br/><p>Her target from the very beginning wasn\u2019t He Erlang, it was He Sanlang.</p><br/><p>The servant who had told He Changdi that Chu Lian was sleeping had been bought by her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, my mind was in a daze then. I don\u2019t know how I made the mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the mention of the incident, the floodgates were opened once again. Tears fell freely from Pan Nianzhen\u2019s eyes which were already swollen from all her crying. She threw herself into He Ying\u2019s embrace and wailed, \u201cMother, what should I do? I can\u2019t live on anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying wanted to admonish her daughter for having foiled the plan. She had arranged everything to perfection, yet her daughter had somehow made a mistake. However, looking at her daughter\u2019s state, she lost the will to reprimand her.</p><br/><p>She sighed and said, \u201cWhat else can we do? You have no choice but to marry Dalang now!\u201d There was decisiveness in her tone.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen sobbed, she obviously didn\u2019t want this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

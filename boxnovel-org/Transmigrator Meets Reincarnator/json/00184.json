After savouring the taste, his eyes lit up and he praised, \u201cIt\u2019s good. Sister-in-Law must be a really good cook.\u201d After saying so, he used his chopsticks to point at He Changdi. \u201cYou lucky brat, you married a good wife! You were crazy enough to come all the way out here to the northern border, but not only did your wife not blame you, she even sent you something good to eat. I heard that you came out here just a few days after getting married, too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuhong hadn\u2019t heard of this news. He had been intently listening to this juicy piece of gossip while shoveling the shredded beef into his mouth, and didn\u2019t even bother to swallow before noisily asking, \u201cBrother He, what\u2019s wrong? Is Sister-in-Law not pretty enough for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo harrumphed. \u201cNot pretty? So what if she\u2019s not pretty? As long as she can manage the household and give birth to a few sons, she\u2019s a good wife! Besides, I heard that he married a legitimate daughter from House Ying!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xiao Yuhong received a sudden warning glare from Zhang Mai, he abruptly came to a realisation.</p><br/><p>The captain\u2019s wife was an ugly woman, but was deeply respected by the captain. She had also given birth to a fair amount of good sons and daughters for him. Xiao Yuhong came from a common family, but he still knew this much from listening to his mother and sisters\u2019 gossip sessions from before. That was also why he knew that, although House Ying was on the decline, their ladies had the reputation of being exceptionally fertile. Furthermore, their looks were all top notch. His wife was most likely not the reason that Brother He had left his home in such a hurry.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuhong knew that he had stepped on a landmine with his careless words, so he stopped talking and buried his head in his bowl of meat.</p><br/><p>From the side, Zhang Mai tried to smooth the dispute over. \u201cCaptain\u2019s right. In the future when we return to the capital, we definitely have to go to the captain\u2019s estate and visit Sister-in-Law.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then that Captain Guo was satisfied. He continued pointing at He Changdi as he lectured him. \u201cSince you\u2019ve come out already and you can\u2019t disobey army orders, you won\u2019t be able to return home for quite some time. Still, you can\u2019t keep your head in the sand! You left a young wife back at home, you heartless bastard! She\u2019s living like a widow, but she hasn\u2019t forgotten to send you packages even with how you\u2019ve treated her. If you have time, make sure you send more letters back home. And when you have the money, don\u2019t forget to buy some local specialties and send them back to your wife and family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to how he usually addressed his brothers on the training grounds, there was an additional trace of sincerity in Captain Guo\u2019s tone. The way he was pointing out He Changdi\u2019s wrongs seemed more like an older brother earnestly lecturing a younger family member for their own good.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai\u2019s smile widened a little upon hearing this. He Changdi also stopped being a block of wood and immediately stood up to bow deeply towards Captain Guo in thanks for his teachings.</p><br/><p>He could also feel that he had become much closer to Captain Guo thanks to this small jar of translucent shredded beef.</p><br/><p>He Changdi stared at the empty jar with mixed feelings in his heart.</p><br/><p>In the middle of this brotherly atmosphere, Xiao Yuhong, who had been acting like a backdrop up till now, pointed at the bowl of shredded beef and mumbled, \u201cBrothers, if you\u2019re not going to eat, this little brother is going to eat it all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after he finished speaking, everyone\u2019s chopsticks shot towards the bowl. Now that everyone had joined the fray, the bowl was quickly emptied. When there was only a thin layer of beef left, Captain Guo glared at He Changdi and said, \u201cWhat are you still eating for? Your wife made this, so you must have eaten tons of this before. And yet you still have the face to keep fighting with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, He Changdi was much more thick-skinned. He scooped up another piece with his chopsticks and, with nary a change in his expression, he said in a low voice, \u201cI left my home just a few days after getting married. This is my first time eating my wife\u2019s cooking, so why can\u2019t I eat more of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai patted He Changdi\u2019s shoulder and burst out into loud laughter. \u201cWell, look who\u2019s become a miser now!\u201d</p><br/><p>That small bowl of shredded beef wasn\u2019t enough when shared between four people. When the bowl was finally empty, none of them was satisfied. In the end, Xiao Yuhong poured the remaining scraps and oil into his own bowl to mix in with the porridge and fill his stomach.</p><br/><p>After that meal, Xiao Yuhong stuck close to He Changdi. \u201cBrother He, when is Sister-in-Law going to send more things over?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s gaze was solidly stuck to the ground. He was truly beginning to regret giving them that taste of beef! Since the beef was so precious to him, he had only eaten small bits of it each time he had taken it out. If he had known that this day would come, he would have definitely eaten his fill and saved himself from heartbreak.</p><br/><p>However, he hadn\u2019t revealed all his cards. He hadn\u2019t taken out the beef and pork jerky that Chu Lian had sent him along with the shredded beef.</p><br/><p>When he heard this brat Xiao Yuhong asking for more, He Changdi looked up and stared coldly at him, thinking in his heart, \u2018My wife didn\u2019t cook this for a stinky man like you! Dream on!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuhong awkwardly rubbed his nose. He was inwardly bubbling with frustration. Brother He seemed easy to get along with normally, so why was he being so stingy now? Xiao Yuhong was determined; in the future, he definitely had to marry a wife from House Ying who could cook well!</p><br/><p>When they finished their meal, the group began to idly chat. Due to this sudden event, they had become much closer when compared to before.</p><br/><p>As they were speaking, there was a sudden burst of commotion from the outside of their small tent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

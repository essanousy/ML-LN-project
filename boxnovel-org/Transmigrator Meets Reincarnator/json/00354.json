She was using some black eyebrow dye to draw on some paper.</p><br/><p>She walked over as soundlessly as she could and stood to one side. She looked at the paper, but she couldn\u2019t tell what Chu Lian was drawing at all. There were even strange symbols marked on the paper here and there.</p><br/><p>Before Wenqing could ask, Chu Lian spoke up first. \u201cQuick, tell Manager Qin to find the best carpenter in Liangzhou City and bring him here! Quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s tone was so firm that Wenqing couldn\u2019t help but treat it as a very serious matter. She had absolute trust in her Third Young Madam. As absurd as Chu Lian\u2019s actions might look to others sometimes, Wenqing would never doubt her mistress. After experiencing the power of her young madam\u2019s ideas so many times, Wenqing had already become a loyal fan of Chu Lian\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Madam, rest assured. This servant will go and look for Manager Qin right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Manager Qin had been given his orders, although he found it rather strange as well, he set to work immediately.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin was quite capable. In just half a day, he managed to find the best carpenter in Liangzhou City and invited him to the He Estate.</p><br/><p>Just as they entered the estate, they bumped into the leader of the He Family\u2019s soldiers, Mo Chenggui.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was dressed in just a single layer of clothing. He was drenched in sweat from shovelling snow, even to the point that his hair seemed to be giving off steam.</p><br/><p>The private soldiers behind him were all panting for breath as well.</p><br/><p>When Mo Chenggui looked up, what he saw was Manager Qin leading an old man in with a bright smile on his face which looked almost ingratiating.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was a stubborn man who had no forbearance for anything. He was already biased against Chu Lian, so he never had anything nice to say to Chu Lian\u2019s subordinate, Manager Qin.</p><br/><p>Normally, the two of them would mind their own business, somewhat keeping the peace in the estate. However, Mo Chenggui wasn\u2019t going to let him off so easily today.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the estate had been put to shovelling snow. Even the two guard siblings from Chu Lian\u2019s courtyard, Li Xing and Li Yue, hadn\u2019t been exempt. However, look at this Manager Qin. It was fine if he didn\u2019t help out, but he had even gone out early in the morning for some idle walk. Now he was bringing back some stranger to the estate.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui shot a glance at Manager Qin from the corners of his eyes. He spoke with a mocking tone, \u201cWhile everyone in the estate is working so hard, Manager Qin seems to have plenty of free time. Even the knee-high snow isn\u2019t enough to stop your feet from wandering out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin didn\u2019t have the time to argue with Mo Chenggui. He bowed towards Mo Chenggui before quickly leading the carpenter towards Chu Lian\u2019s courtyard.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui\u2019s wrinkled old face turned dark with anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at what a good dog he is!\u201d</p><br/><p>The private soldiers next to him kept silent, afraid that they would accidentally spark the temper of their volatile old brother.</p><br/><p>After getting ignored by Manager Qin, Mo Chenggui couldn\u2019t hold down the frustration in his heart. He spit on the ground before saying, \u201cSend someone to see what kind of trouble Third Young Madam is trying to cause now!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the soldiers acknowledged the order and left.</p><br/><p>When Manager Qin led the carpenter into the courtyard, Chu Lian was already seated in the parlour with some papers in hand.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin was very reliable when it came to business. Although the carpenter he had found wasn\u2019t literate, when Chu Lian explained her blueprints to him, he immediately understood. He was really the best in the woodworking business around here after all. The old carpenter examined the three blueprints, each with a different view of the design, for about fifteen minutes before knowing exactly what he had to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master, how fast can you make this?\u201d Chu Lian asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>The old carpenter looked at the blueprints in his hands for a moment before speaking, \u201cEsteemed Madam, this old man has never done anything like this after living for so long. This old man will speak to you honestly. If this old man were to do it alone, it would take at least five days. If you would allow this old man to bring in this old man\u2019s sons and grandsons to help, then it can be done in about two to three days.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She predicted that they would able to create a new trade route in a year or two if business went well, with the support of the northern border troops.</p><br/><p>By then, this trade route with the barbarians would likely become the best way to supply the army with good-quality steeds.</p><br/><p>Even if they had to hand over a half of the profits of the trade route to the government, the remaining profits were still a good amount.</p><br/><p>Since the simple market was still in the middle of growing, Chu Lian left Manager Qin, Narisong and Myeryen behind in Liangzhou. Once everything was stable and once they found some suitable managers to take over, she would summon them to the capital.</p><br/><p>After resting for a month, He Changdi\u2019s wounds were getting much better. Although he still couldn\u2019t walk normally, he could move slowly using some crutches.</p><br/><p>According to the doctor, He Sanlang was young and his body was in good shape. Although he had been wounded heavily this time, with enough nutrition during his recovery period, he would be able to recover quickly. After one more month, he would be able to walk normally. In two more, even riding wouldn\u2019t pose any problems.</p><br/><p>The troops heading to Suzhou formed a long line, winding through the snow-covered grasslands like a little dragon.</p><br/><p>He Changi was seated in a snowboat alone with an overcast expression.</p><br/><p>Laiyue huddled in a corner of the warm pen upon seeing how his master was in bad mood. He didn\u2019t even dare to breathe audibly.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang leaned against the wall of the warm pen with a book in a hand. Who knew if he managed to read any of it? Anyway, an hour had already passed but Laiyue hadn\u2019t seen him flip the page yet.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang suddenly put down the book and ordered Laiyue, \u201cGo and ask your Third Young Madam what\u2019s for lunch later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue quickly obeyed and jumped off He Changdi\u2019s snowboat. It wasn\u2019t until he had gotten off the snowboat and switched to a horse that Laiyue heaved a sigh of relief. He shook his head helplessly and headed towards Third Young Madam\u2019s snowboat instead.</p><br/><p>Right now, Sima Hui was chatting with Chu Lian in a warm pen. Their maidservants would interject with some jokes from time to time, so there were occasional bursts of laughter from the warm pen.</p><br/><p>When Laiyue drew close, he sighed inwardly. No wonder his young master wasn\u2019t happy. Third Young Madam had abandoned him in a snowboat by himself to come chat with General Sima so happily. It would be crazy if Third Young Master was happy about this.</p><br/><p>In a short moment, Urihan had lifted the curtain covering the entrance and jumped into the warm pen. She passed Laiyue\u2019s words over to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian found it funny. She asked for the time and realised it was almost time for the midday meal.</p><br/><p>She then ordered Wenlan to pass a small box of food to Urihan, who was to pass it to Laiyue outside and send it to He Changdi.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to travel to Suzhou, even with the snowboats, so they wouldn\u2019t stop in the middle of the day, even for lunch. Thus, most of their midday meals were some dry rations. They would only make a warm meal when they stopped for the night.</p><br/><p>Holding the small box of food, Laiyue didn\u2019t even dare to lift the curtain of his master\u2019s warm pen.</p><br/><p>It was only when He Sanlang purposely coughed that Laiyue had to brace himself and enter.</p><br/><p>As expected, he was met with He Sanlang\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>They finally reached Su City on this night. Some of the family soldiers had already gone ahead to book their rooms for the night.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had specially made arrangements in private. He would naturally share a room with Chu Lian when they reached the inn.</p><br/><p>This time, before Sima Hui could stick to Chu Lian, she had already been dragged back to their room by He Sanlang.</p><br/><p>Once they reached their room in the inn, the wooden door was slammed shut with a bang. He Changdi threw his crutches to one side and pressed Chu Lian up against the wooden door.</p><br/><p>His strong arms were placed on either side of her body, trapping her within his embrace.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was still dazed from all the movement. She felt a pinch on her soft lips, then her mouth was open to He Changdi\u2019s plundering.</p><br/><p>His demands were both sudden and forceful. Chu Lian couldn\u2019t fight against him with the tiny bit of strength she had. The hands she had placed against his chest slowly turned limp and slipped down to grasp the lapels of his tunic.</p><br/><p>Once that domineering kiss was over, the two of them panted for breath. Chu Lian was especially flushed while her almond-shaped eyes were glazed over. Her warm and fragrant breath blew over He Changdi\u2019s chest in puffs. Although they were separated by a layer of clothing, it felt as if those warm puffs were brushing directly over his bare chest.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly covered up her burning face with one hand and frowned. She used her other hand to push forcefully at the strong arms He Sanlang had put on either side of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Changdi, let me go! Let me out!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang cast his eyes downwards to stare at the flushed woman in his arms. His eyes darkened but he didn\u2019t speak, as if trying to carve this moment into his heart.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t push him away, but it was just too embarrassing to be in this pose, trapped against the door. She gulped nervously, subconsciously trying to hide from this intimacy.</p><br/><p>She eyed the gap under his arms and prepared to squeeze her body out from that gap.</p><br/><p>However, before she could move, He Changdi seemed to have predicted her actions. He moved his right arm so it was no longer pressed against the door. Instead, he wrapped it around her slender waist, trapping her solidly within his embrace. She wouldn\u2019t be able to escape now.</p><br/><p>His hand started kneading her waist gently, tickling Chu Lian and making her want to laugh. She started struggling and trying to escape, but his hand moved downwards smoothly and landed a sound smack on her butt.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She first heard a light crack before an intense pain on her jaw overwhelmed her senses. Her forehead broke out into cold sweat from the pain.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t even close her mouth, so how would she be able to say anything?</p><br/><p>He Changdi threw her to the ground, where she sprawled out in a pitiful manner. She was in so much pain that she couldn\u2019t even straighten her back.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had just dislocated her jaw!</p><br/><p>Following that, He Changdi ordered with a shout, \u201cServants, come in and take her away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone pushed open the door to the study once again from the outside. The person who entered was none other than He Changdi\u2019s manservant, Laiyue.</p><br/><p>Laiyue had come in with two guards. With a wave of his hand, they swiftly dragged Fuyan out.</p><br/><p>After Fuyan was taken away, Laiyue secured the door before reporting to his master.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Master, after some investigation, we found that it was someone from Qingxi Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is she serving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a third-ranked maidservant who used to do menial chores in Qingxi Hall. When Eldest Madam and Miss Pan returned to the estate, Senior Servant Liu promoted her and assigned her to serve Eldest Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSend someone to keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue acknowledged the order, but he didn\u2019t leave right away. He stood beside He Changdi appearing as if he was hesitating to speak.</p><br/><p>He Changdi turned a bland look on him.</p><br/><p>Laiyue felt a chill all over his body and the hesitation in his mind suddenly cleared up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Third Young Madam. Third Young Madam\u2019s servants already know that Fuyan came in earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to Laiyue\u2019s report, a trace of panic appeared in He Changdi\u2019s eyes. However, he managed to get his emotions under control in short order.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind that order, He Sanlang abruptly broke into a quick stride and exited the study. He seemed to be going towards the direction of the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Laiyue was still rooted to the same spot in his confusion.</p><br/><p>What exactly was going on? Wasn\u2019t his master still mad at Third Young Madam? Why did it seem like he was in a rush?</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t understand it, he decided that it was better to stop thinking about it. A bachelor like him wouldn\u2019t be able to understand the goings-on between couples anyways. It would be more practical to just go back to his room earlier and rest.</p><br/><p>He Changdi slowed down only when he reached the parlour. He suddenly realised that he was still holding the letter in his hand.</p><br/><p>He paused in his steps and held up the letter in his hand. He stared at it for a few seconds. A shadows fell over He Sanlang\u2019s eyes and he walked towards the brazier in the parlour. With a quick flick of his hand, the unopened letter fell into the brazier. The greedy flames quickly crept over the paper. It only took a few seconds before the letter turned into a pile of ashes.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang breathed a sigh of relief after he watched the letter turn to dust. The knot of emotions within his eyes seemed to have disappeared along with the letter.</p><br/><p>He turned around and walked towards the bedroom, his rapid pace betraying his sense of urgency.</p><br/><p>Wenlan was on the night shift, so she was the one who heard his arrival from the side room. Knowing that it was He Changdi, she didn\u2019t come out to disturb him.</p><br/><p>The moment Chu Lian heard the footsteps from outside, she hurriedly put away the storybook and hid inside the blanket.</p><br/><p>In the darkness, she could sense the other side of the bed sinking in a little.</p><br/><p>Following that, she was suddenly pulled into a familiar embrace, blanket and all.</p><br/><p>Before she could even open her eyes, kisses were raining continuously on her face. Finally, her dewy lips were captured, forcing her to open her crystal-clear eyes.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t given Chu Lian any chance to resist. By the time he released her, she was already panting hard with a flushed face.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s expression was strangely calm. He stared at that beautiful and delicate face in front of him and suppressed his burgeoning desires so that he could speak, \u201cIt was Fuyan. The one who relayed the message was a maidservant who serves He Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t seem surprised by the news. She had already known that Fuyan wasn\u2019t loyal to her, but that maidservant was definitely suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone from Aunt\u2019s side? But this doesn\u2019t feel like the way she works.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi took off his shoes and got on the bed. He didn\u2019t even take off his outerwear and leaned directly against the bed frame, his long arms cradling Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>He let out a cold snort, breaking the silence, \u201cHe Ying? She\u2019s not that smart. She\u2019s not responsible for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gravity of the matter they were discussing slowly helped to calm the young couple down from their previous intimacy.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian lifted her head and asked out of curiosity, \u201cThen who do you think is responsible for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang couldn\u2019t resist caressing Chu Lian\u2019s shoulder with the arm that he had placed around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Sister-in-Law. But I\u2019m not sure about the mastermind behind her. Madam Zou doesn\u2019t have the guts to do this herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian inadvertently thought of the servants under Matriarch He. Multiple faces flashed through her mind, but none of them stood out to her.</p><br/><p>In the end, even her brows had furrowed together.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s thoughtful gaze had returned to Chu Lian\u2019s face at some point. The little wrinkles that the frown had made on her face gave him the irresistible urge to smooth them out. He gave in to the desire and reached out to stroke the crease between her brows gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, are you still angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was jolted out of her thoughts by his sudden question. She glared at him, \u201cWhat did Fuyan say to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang suddenly remembered that letter. His eyes narrowed and he hugged the lovely figure in his arms more tightly a moment later, \u201cNothing much. She was just an ambitious maidservant.\u201d</p><br/><p>His half-hearted attempt at brushing off the topic made Chu Lian even more suspicious.</p><br/><p>She placed her hands against He Changdi\u2019s chest and pushed him away slightly. Her brows furrowed even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Changdi, do you take me for a fool?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was slightly startled by her reaction. He had no choice but to confess the whole truth, \u201cThe letter Xiao Bojian wrote to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026</p><br/><p>Had she been cursed with bad luck somehow? When had Xiao Bojian written a letter to her? Why didn\u2019t she know anything about it?</p><br/><p>So such an important piece of evidence had been in Fuyan\u2019s hands this whole time. Coupled with the feelings that she had for her crazy husband, it was no wonder that she had decided to jump at the chance tonight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Was this really just a coincidence?</p><br/><p>As her mind was preoccupied, Chu Lian didn\u2019t notice the dark clouds gathering on He Sanlang\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>The couple continued walking in silence for a good distance. When they arrived at the garden outside of Songtao Court, He Sanlang suddenly stopped short and led Chu Lian over to an octagonal pavilion nearby.</p><br/><p>He stood with his back against the wind and used his tall figure to shield Chu Lian from the chilly breeze, \u201cLian\u2019er, you don\u2019t have to make the candied hawthorns anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was still lost in her thoughts. Upon hearing this statement from her husband, she let out a confused \u2018huh?\u2019 and looked up at He Changdi.</p><br/><p>It was only then that she finally noticed the peculiar expression on his face.</p><br/><p>When met with Chu Lian\u2019s clear and innocent eyes, despite having already lived one lifetime, He Changdi didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>He pursed his lips and extended his arm to take Chu Lian\u2019s small and soft figure into his embrace.</p><br/><p>The feeling of his wife lying peacefully in his arms made him sigh contentedly.</p><br/><p>With a possessive tone, he proclaimed, \u201cYou are MY wife, you don\u2019t need to cook for anybody else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite how baffling and awkward his words were and how controlling they seemed, Chu Lian still felt warm and fuzzy inside.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian snuggled into his chest for a bit, before she raised her head and stared at him, \u201cIt\u2019s your mother we\u2019re talking about, she\u2019s not just anybody.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t reply this time. He tightened his arms around her and turned his gaze out towards the frozen lake which had yet to melt, with a profound look in his eyes that probably no one would understand.</p><br/><p>In his previous life, Miaozhen had miscarried, and the culprit had been \u2018Chu Lian\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>Was the mastermind in the shadows trying to pull something again?</p><br/><p>At Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>The brazier in the parlour was burning brightly and the walls were heated, so the room was as warm as spring. Senior Servant Liu was feeling hot in her cotton jacket, but the matriarch who sat on the heated bed felt that it was still chilly.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu took a porcelain bowl with the sign of longevity painted on it from another servant and carried it over to Matriarch He, \u201cMatriarch, perhaps this servant should ask Great Doctor Miao to check on you. Your health is a far cry from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He waved her hand to reject that notion, \u201cUnnecessary. Putting aside the fact that Great Doctor Miao just gave me a checkup two days ago, this illness of mine can only be cured by a deity. You don\u2019t have to trouble Great Doctor Miao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu let out a soft sigh. Matriarch He had too many worries on her mind and she was getting old, which was why her health had declined so much. To have a healthy body, one had to have a clear mind, so it was indeed pointless to rely on Great Doctor Miao to cure the matriarch.</p><br/><p>No matter how great a doctor is, they couldn\u2019t possibly restore vigour that had been sapped away by time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNevertheless, you should still drink this bowl of medicinal soup, Matriarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He didn\u2019t reject her this time. She accepted the bowl and drank two mouthfuls of it. Finding it tasteless, she put it to one side.</p><br/><p>She dismissed the other servants waiting upon her in the room before taking Senior Servant Liu\u2019s hand into her own. She asked seriously, \u201cXiangyun, what do you think about Sanlang\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu was stunned by this sudden question, but she immediately realised what was on Matriarch He\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu smiled and said, \u201cMatriarch, you must be thinking about letting Third Young Madam manage the household, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He looked at her with surprise, \u201cYou old fox, I can\u2019t hide anything from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu started massaging Matriarch He\u2019s shoulders as she spoke, \u201cThis servant may be overstepping her bounds but I believe that Third Young Madam is the best choice for managing the household in our estate. It\u2019s obvious just from looking at Songtao Court and Guilin Restaurant. Hasn\u2019t Third Young Madam done well beyond expectations for both of them? Third Young Master also seemed very pleased with Third Young Madam. The couple looked like they were joined at the hip when they came for their morning greetings earlier, how enviable.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Senior Servant Liu gave her opinion, Matriarch He fell into deep contemplation.</p><br/><p>Noticing the silence of the matriarch, Senior Servant Liu didn\u2019t disrupt her from her thoughts and just continued massaging her gently instead.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Matriarch He sighed deeply, \u201cHow could I possibly be unaware of how well Sanlang\u2019s wife has done? However, she\u2019s still so young\u2026 When all\u2019s said and done, she\u2019s just a mere sixteen years of age. She\u2019s only a little older than Nianzhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this statement from Matriarch He, Senior Servant Liu realised that the matriarch had already come to her own conclusion in her heart. She stayed silent now, knowing that the matriarch didn\u2019t fully trust Third Young Madam.</p><br/><p>If the matriarch did not truly believe in someone, even if she tried persuading otherwise, the matriarch wouldn\u2019t waver at all. She might even damage the friendly relationship that they had cultivated over the years.</p><br/><p>While the master and servant shared a private conversation in the room, a maidservant outside the room announced that \u2018Leader Mo\u2019 was requesting an audience.</p><br/><p>When Matriarch He shot Senior Servant Liu a look, Senior Servant Liu bobbed in acknowledgement and headed out to bring Leader Mo in.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui scanned the parlour the very moment he entered. He relaxed when he noticed that there were no outsiders around.</p><br/><p>He greeted Matriarch He with a bow.</p><br/><p>The matriarch had him take a seat and ordered Senior Servant Liu to bring tea for him.</p><br/><p>Once he had settled down, the matriarch asked, \u201cLeader Mo, is something the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guards of House Jing\u2019an worked in shifts under a schedule specially planned by Heir Jing\u2019an, He Changqi. Except in the cases of emergencies or matters concerning the inner court, the guards normally wouldn\u2019t request to meet the matriarch.</p><br/><p>However, looking at Mo Chenggui, he seemed to have a special reason for coming to visit her.</p><br/><p>Leader Mo mulled over the question for a moment and finally nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMatriarch, there\u2019s a matter that I have been brooding over for some time\u2026 Since the Count isn\u2019t around, I\u2019ve decided to report this matter to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later, Leader Mo departed from Qingxi Hall, leaving behind an alarmed Matriarch He and Senior Servant Liu.</p><br/><p>There was a complicated look in Matriarch He\u2019s eyes. She had never expected Sanlang\u2019s wife to have been abducted while at the northern border!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she had spent the night out\u2026</p><br/><p>Although the Great Wu Dynasty was starting to become more open-minded, that was only when compared to the previous dynasty. Even though women in this dynasty had more freedom than before, the reputation of noble ladies were still regarded with utmost importance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

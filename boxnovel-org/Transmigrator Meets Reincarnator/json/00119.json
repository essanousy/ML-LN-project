No wonder they had to dip it in soy sauce and salt.</p><br/><p>The soy sauce and salt combo could add some taste to the meat, but that was only on the outermost layer. It was worth noting that even the most finely ground salt here was coarser than the table salt of the modern world. She could clearly see every single grain of salt, and the larger crystals arguably made the crispy skin it coated even saltier. The meat on the inside was the complete opposite: utterly tasteless. While biting down was like eating a mouthful of salt, chewing was equally horrid. She couldn\u2019t taste any duck at all. With this sort of uneven flavour distribution, how could anyone consider this delicious?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was used to lighter flavours, and this duck definitely didn\u2019t match her tastes. However, Royal Princess Duanjia was watching her so she couldn\u2019t just spit it out. She quickly chewed the piece of duck in her mouth and swallowed it with difficulty.</p><br/><p>She coughed twice to disguise her disgust. When Royal Princess Duanjia saw her reaction, she asked, \u201cChu Liu, how is it? Did you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked up at Royal Princess Duanjia. Although her expression was rather calm, the anticipation of a positive answer in her eyes gave her away.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t bear to waste her good intentions, so she tried to gloss over it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon receiving an answer she hadn\u2019t expected, Royal Princess Duanjia frowned. \u201cIs it tasty or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian awkwardly smiled. She was already numb to the dreadful food here. Perhaps even the imperial banquets in this darn Great Wu Dynasty were of this standard.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cChu Liu. Could it be\u2026 that you know how to make even tastier roast duck?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wanted to say no, but Royal Princess Duanjia quickly followed with, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me! Or I\u2019ll tell my father that you bullied me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Chu Lian hadn\u2019t expected the amiable Royal Princess Duanjia to suddenly behave like a tsundere towards her.</p><br/><p>Considering Prince Wei\u2019s status, and comparing him to her own father, who was simply slacking around in a cushy official job while House Ying was going into decline, Chu Lian had to give in. The princess\u2019 dad was too strong for her. If they were to call out their fathers, she would be completely obliterated.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian replied with a quick turn of wit, \u201cRoyal Princess, I can\u2019t guarantee that my roast duck is magnitudes better, but it would be at least a teeny bit better than Yuehong Restaurant\u2019s roast duck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian even held out her right hand and made a pinching gesture to show how tiny the difference would be, with her fingertips almost touching.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia hadn\u2019t thought that this little brat in front of her actually knew how to cook roast duck. Her eyes darted about as she thought. \u201cIn a few days, I\u2019ll send another invite for you to come to my estate. How about we cook roast duck together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Royal Princess Duanjia was proposing this with a straight face, she was laughing her head off on the inside. Hmph! She knew that this roast duck wasn\u2019t all that good. Her fourth brother had actually spent a huge sum to buy the secret recipe for this duck. Now even Chu Liu could make something better than this. What a joke! She definitely had to give Fourth Brother a piece of Chu Liu\u2019s roast duck. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll expire from anger!</p><br/><p>While indulging in her smug thoughts, Royal Princess Duanjia had completely forgotten that she had been the one who wanted to come to Yuehong Restaurant to eat this roast duck in the first place.</p><br/><p>However, now that Chu Lian had given it such a poor evaluation, it didn\u2019t seem to be as delicious as before, no matter how much she continued eating.</p><br/><p>Out of all the ways she had tried to imagine how this day with Royal Princess Duanjia would go, Chu Lian hadn\u2019t expected them to spend the whole day on eating.</p><br/><p>Again, she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>The roast duck was the only dish in Yuehong Restaurant that the princess liked, and she didn\u2019t think the other dishes were all that good. Since Chu Lian had made her lose interest in eating any more of the roast duck, the two of them just ate a little more of the meal. They did take a liking to the sweet, fragrant fruit wine that Yuehong Restaurant offered, so the two of them drank more of that.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia and Chu Lian chattered on happily in their private room, not knowing that every word was falling into the ears of someone in the room next door.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan couldn\u2019t help but cover his mouth with a hand, his cheeks flushing red as he held back his laughter. In the end, he lost the fight and burst into a fit of coughing. He gave up and laughed outright.</p><br/><p>The Fourth Brother that Royal Princess Duanjia had mentioned happened to be Prince Jin. He already had an unhappy expression on his face. Those extraordinary azure eyes of his coldly swept over Tang Yan, causing the man in question to abruptly shiver.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan quickly stopped laughing after receiving that warning glare. He straightened up and put on a serious face as he said, \u201cThis lowly official dares to ask Fourth Prince, how much did you spend on the secret recipe for this roast duck?\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin\u2019s face stiffened and he shot another flying dagger of a glare at the man. \u201cTang Yan, do you perhaps feel that you\u2019re being paid too much as an official, since you\u2019re coming to Yuehong Restaurant to spend it all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Having some intelligence about him, Tang Yan immediately shut up. However, just like Royal Princess Duanjia, he didn\u2019t feel much like eating the crispy roast duck before him now.</p><br/><p>He lamented, \u201cThis lowly official wonders how skilled the princess\u2019 friend is at cooking roast duck. This lowly official would like to try some.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin generously bestowed another cold glare upon him. \u201cHave you gotten addicted to testing your courage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yan awkwardly coughed before turning the conversation back to their original topic. \u201cYour Highness, He Sanlang has already reached Liangzhou. These are the letters that he sent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yan was one of Prince Jin\u2019s subordinate officials, as well as one of his trusted advisors.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin took the stack of letters from Tang Yan, only reading the letter that He Changdi had written to him. The other two letters meant for House Jing\u2019an were kept to one side. He would send someone to the Jing\u2019an Estate with them when he reached home.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend a team of men and horses over to Changdi. They are to be at his disposal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yan nodded.</p><br/><p>When the two of them were almost done with their business, Prince Jin heard the ladies next door preparing to leave for Defeng Teahouse for the show.</p><br/><p>Remembering He Changdi\u2019s words in the letter just now, asking him to take \u2018special care\u2019 of Chu Lian, Prince Jin and Tang Yan also stood up to move to Defeng Teahouse in secret.</p><br/><p>Actually, while writing the words \u2018special care\u2019, He Changdi had been gritting his teeth in anger. His brush had been trembling while writing out the words, and he had almost fainted from the force of his rage. Who could know if Prince Jin could sense the conflict and anger in his heart?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

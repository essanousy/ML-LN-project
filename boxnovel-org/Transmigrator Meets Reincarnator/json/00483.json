The young lady was wearing a lilac dress that cinched at the waist, paired with a jacket that buttoned down the front. Her hair had been combed into a style that was currently popular in the capital. A ruby chain headdress shone against her dark hair, which made her skin appear even more fair and smooth. The bright smile on her face made her a picture-perfect beauty.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He suddenly felt somewhat displeased with her granddaughter-in-law, who seemed to be blossoming into her looks.</p><br/><p>However, there wasn\u2019t a single hint of her inner thoughts showing on her facial expression as she asked, \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, are you going out today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded upon hearing the matriarch\u2019s question, \u201cReplying to Grandmother, Royal Princess Duanjia sent an invitation yesterday. Since I happen to be free today, I wanted to pay a visit to Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying and Pan Nianzhen were shocked when they heard her words. It was out of their expectations that the first person Chu Lian would visit upon returning to the capital was Royal Princess Duanjia!</p><br/><p>They had heard about the status of Royal Princess Duanjia.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen had also personally met Royal Princess Duanjia that day at the birthday banquet in Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia had a high status by birth. She also had a haughty and cold personality which meant that she didn\u2019t interact much with other noble ladies. Pan Nianzhen had seen how several legitimate daughters of noble families had tried to chat with Royal Princess Duanjia at Princess Wei\u2019s banquet and how they had been coldly rejected.</p><br/><p>A personage like Royal Princess Duanjia had actually sent an invitation to Chu Lian post-haste!</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was shaken to the core by this bit of news.</p><br/><p>He Ying was surprised as well, but she had already begun making her own plans.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He wasn\u2019t really surprised by this, since she knew that Chu Lian had a good relationship with Royal Princess Duanjia. She had also gone to Prince Wei\u2019s Estate often before going to the northern border.</p><br/><p>Thus, the matriarch simply stated, \u201cPrincess Wei provided much assistance during your journey to the northern border. You should indeed pay her a visit in person to express your gratitude. When I visited Prince Wei\u2019s Estate some time ago, Princess Wei even asked after you. Don\u2019t forget your manners when you go today. \u201c</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s expression showed that she was listening very seriously. When the matriarch finished speaking, she nodded in response.</p><br/><p>Although there was nothing wrong with Matriarch He\u2019s words, Chu Lian could sense the difference in the matriarch\u2019s attitude.</p><br/><p>Her words were polite, but she seemed to be completely ignoring her obligation as an elder member of the family. </p><br/><p>If her attitude was the same as before, Matriarch He would have instructed the servants to help prepare a suitable gift.</p><br/><p>After all, Prince Wei\u2019s Estate had really provided much needed help throughout the trip to the northern border. Moreover, Chu Lian wasn\u2019t the only one who benefited from their help. It could be said that Prince Wei\u2019s Estate had taken care of House Jing\u2019an as a whole.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, Princess Wei wouldn\u2019t have invited Matriarch He to her important birthday banquet.</p><br/><p>He Ying quickly shot her mother a look. She stared at Matriarch He with pleading eyes.</p><br/><p>When the matriarch made eye contact with her daughter, she was momentarily stunned. It didn\u2019t take long before her heart softened.</p><br/><p>She still felt a little guilty when she thought of the cold treatment her only daughter had received upon returning to the capital.</p><br/><p>The matriarch had the intention to help her daughter settle in the capital. Although her daughter had been rather \u2018rebellious\u2019 when she was younger, she had already matured with age and she was able to comport herself with proper etiquette now.</p><br/><p>The only problem was that she still had a bad reputation, especially as a widow who had returned to her maiden family. Thus, she wasn\u2019t very welcome in the social circles of the noblewomen in the capital. The matriarch had brought her daughter and granddaughter along to several banquets, so she had personally seen her daughter being excluded. It was inevitable that Matriarch He would feel uncomfortable with this situation.</p><br/><p>Although she blamed those noble ladies for only pandering to power, her daughter had indeed been a little too deviant in the past. Therefore, there was nothing she could do about her exclusion from noble society. </p><br/><p>However, if her daughter and granddaughter could get on friendly terms with Royal Princess Duanjia and Princess Wei, then there might be a favourable turn to this situation.</p><br/><p>The matriarch couldn\u2019t bear her daughter\u2019s earnest pleading for long.</p><br/><p>She let out an awkward cough before asking, \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, are you going to Prince Wei\u2019s Estate alone today?</p><br/><p>While Chu Lian thought that the matriarch\u2019s tone had changed rather quickly, she hadn\u2019t realised that it was related to He Ying and her daughter. Thus, she answered truthfully .</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband is also going, but he\u2019s stopping by the Left Military Guards first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The road to Prince Wei\u2019s Estate and the Left Military Guards happened to be in opposing directions. Matriarch He smiled kindly, \u201cSince you\u2019re going by yourself, then take Miss Pan along with you. You\u2019re all about the same age as Royal Princess Duanjia. There\u2019ll be plenty to talk about with three young ladies together.\u201d </p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen hadn\u2019t expect her grandmother to say this. Delight appeared on her face. She would be able to interact more with Third Cousin like this.</p><br/><p>Hesitation flared up in Chu Lian\u2019s heart, but she didn\u2019t let it show on her face. She shot a nonchalant glance at the matriarch, before turning her gaze on Eldest Madam and her daughter.</p><br/><p>Although she was unhappy, as a granddaughter-in-law, she couldn\u2019t reject Grandmother upfront when she had made such a request.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was obviously using her to help He Ying and her daughter make some connections.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s cold voice resounded just as Chu Lian was about to agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, I need to accompany Lian\u2019er to Prince Wei\u2019s Estate first. Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia have been taking great care of Lian\u2019er. As her husband, it\u2019s improper that I haven\u2019t paid them a visit them yet. Thus, it would be inconvenient for Cousin to follow along.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi spoke with a cool tone that brooked no argument. The Emperor had placed him in an important position, so even Matriarch He had to give some face to her youngest grandson. </p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s so, then the two of you should leave earlier. Miss Pan, you won\u2019t go along today. Sanlang\u2019s wife can bring her along next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, thank you for your understanding. It\u2019s getting late, so Lian\u2019er and I will take our leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He waved her hand and dismissed the couple.</p><br/><p>He Changdi pulled Chu Lian up with him and they both bowed towards Matriarch He before leaving Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>As soon as they left, He Ying let all of her dissatisfaction show on her face.</p><br/><p>She complained with indignation, \u201cMother! Is Sanlang looking down on us? If Sanlang dislikes us, then I can\u2019t continue living in this estate. I\u2019ll bring Nianzhen back to Siyang tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was similarly stunned. She hadn\u2019t thought that He Changdi would actually refuse Grandmother and leave her in the estate.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was getting a headache from the sound of her daughter\u2019s wailing. Her heart was also pent up with frustration.</p><br/><p>Of course she had noticed that He Sanlang had done that to protect Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>There was a hint of anger in her voice when she spoke, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to cry about!? If it weren\u2019t for all the preposterous things you\u2019ve done in the past, would Sanlang have rejected you on the spot?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

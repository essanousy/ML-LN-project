As expected, there was a stack of 100 tael notes, five in total. They were all issued by Datong Bank.</p><br/><p>She took out one note and held it out to Senior Servant Gui. \u201cMomo, keep this hundred taels in case of emergency. I\u2019ll keep the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui waved her hands as she looked at the hundred tael note. \u201cNo, no! This is Third Young Madam\u2019s dowry. How could this old servant keep it? Rest assured, we don\u2019t need to spend any money within the estate. There won\u2019t be any emergencies at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she finished speaking, the corners of her eyes turned red. Thinking back to the days in the Ying Estate, Sixth Miss had always hoarded her money like it was treasure, afraid that these lowly servants would find her money and steal it. Although Senior Servant Gui didn\u2019t hold that kind of behaviour against Chu Lian, she couldn\u2019t help but feel that small distance between them. As close as they were, they were still master and servant in the end. A grudge would be the worst thing that could come between them.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled. Of course she could guess what Senior Servant Gui was thinking. She inwardly pursed her lips, scolding the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 for being too silly.</p><br/><p>No matter how much Senior Servant Gui tried to reject the money, Chu Lian still pushed the note in Senior Servant Gui\u2019s hands in the end. \u201cMomo, keep it. You never know what might happen. It\u2019s better to have this money in hand, rather than none at all. Money can solve a lot of problems in this world. Anyway, I still have four hundred taels with me! It\u2019s not a small sum at all. I\u2019ve finally learned to let go of some things. Money at hand is meant to be spent anyway; why be calculative about who\u2019s keeping it? Momo, I was too narrow-minded in the past, and I was in the wrong. Please don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Chu Lian speak like that, Senior Servant Gui couldn\u2019t hold back her emotions any longer. Tears streamed down her cheeks and she let out a choked sob, the thin banknote gripped tightly in her hands. She couldn\u2019t find the strength to speak, and could only nod. Any servant who served their masters with all their heart would want to earn their acknowledgement and trust. Now that she had earned Chu Lian\u2019s trust today, Senior Servant Gui felt that the grievances she had suffered in the past were all worth it.</p><br/><p>Within her heart, she silently said, \u2018Madam, did you see that? Young Miss has grown up and matured. You can rest in peace now.\u2019</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian saw that Senior Servant Gui had lost control of her emotions, she wanted to cheer her up.</p><br/><p>She drew closer and answered Senior Servant Gui\u2019s teary expression with a bright smile, her eyes narrowing into crescents. \u201cWhy? Does momo think I\u2019ve given too little? Just wait till I earn more money! I\u2019ll let you count the notes until your hands are sore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui burst into a chuckle and glared playfully at Chu Lian. \u201cThird Young Madam has such a silver tongue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can back my words up with results! Momo, don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do! Momo trusts you the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui watched the pretty young flower before her, freed from burden. She felt that she had never been as lighthearted as she was now. Sixth Miss had been restrained and gloomy in the past. The current Sixth Miss was like a beautiful piece of jade, cleansed of all impurities. She practically radiated a comfortable warmth that drew others in. As for whether Sixth Miss was merely boasting about earning more money or not, what did that matter? As long as they were all peaceful and happy, she would be content.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They were going to send He Ying and her daughter off to one of House Jing\u2019an\u2019s rural holdings and keep them there under guard.</p><br/><p>They were also going to rotate the servants in Qingxi Hall out so as to prevent any incidents from happening again.</p><br/><p>Now that Count Jing\u2019an was back, it was time to bring forward He Changjue\u2019s engagement.</p><br/><p>Since Eldest Brother He Changqi had just divorced, there wasn\u2019t a need to find a second wife for him so quickly.</p><br/><p>Once Second Brother took a wife, it wouldn\u2019t be good for him to stay on in the estate, since he had his own noble title. Why not leave the estate and make their own home earlier?</p><br/><p>Especially since his grandmother had something against Chu Lian now, it was better for them to leave the Jing\u2019an Estate.</p><br/><p>Actually, Matriarch He was still in the dark about his decision. However, He Changdi had no intention of telling his grandmother until they were ready to move out.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Sanlang had already made preparations so quickly, Chu Lian felt reassured. Her smile reached her eyes, turning them into crescents.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going to live in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Chu Lian had lived in the Great Wu for close to a year, she was still a modern person deep down. She wanted to have her own home with her husband.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had already looked at several courtyards outside in secret. He bent down and smiled, \u201cShall we go take a look together soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian happily agreed to it. They didn\u2019t lack money right now, so it would be better to choose an estate that they liked.</p><br/><p>While the gloomy clouds over the He couple had cleared up, there was a storm brewing somewhere else.</p><br/><p>To the west of the capital, an average-looking carriage stopped outside the walls of an ordinary residence.</p><br/><p>The blinds of the entrance of the carriage were lifted, and a middle-aged man dressed in grey jumped out. There was a sword hanging at his waist. After exiting the carriage, he respectfully lifted the blinds once again and helped a young man out.</p><br/><p>The young man had exquisitely handsome looks. If not for the Adam\u2019s apple on his throat, he would have been beautifully androgynous.</p><br/><p>One followed behind Xiao Bojian and whispered into his ear, \u201cMaster, this is the place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian frowned. He straightened out his clothes before pushing the gates open and entering.</p><br/><p>This small rural residence was built in the most common layout: a main building and two rooms to the east and west. There was a persimmon tree growing in the middle of the yard, with a well beside it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian took in the courtyard with one glance and noticed a single green-clothed maidservant guarding the west room\u2019s entrance.</p><br/><p>He paused in his footsteps, a glint of loathing flashing across his eyes, although he quickly concealed it again.</p><br/><p>He strode forth to the west wing with One following behind him, his head bowed. After Xiao Bojian pushed the door open and entered the west room, One stood guard at the door together with the green-clothed maidservant.</p><br/><p>Not too long later, the sounds of lovemaking resounded from the room.</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s voice was unfamiliar, but extremely flirty.</p><br/><p>One was trained in the martial arts, so his senses were heightened. His brows drew together at the sounds coming from the room, while the maidservant next to him blushed.</p><br/><p>An hour later, peace returned to the west room.</p><br/><p>One heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>There was a strong tell-tale smell within the room.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much in the way of furniture in the room, just a single bed, a table and two chairs. However, the quality of the furnishings spoke of deliberate and careful placement.</p><br/><p>The voices of a man and woman in conversation could be heard from within the bedchamber.</p><br/><p>The man was Xiao Bojian, of course. His tone carried a hint of ice and gloominess, so it was easy to identify.</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s voice was soft, sweet and flirtatious.</p><br/><p>From her voice, one could discern that she wasn\u2019t very young and was already past her twenties.</p><br/><p>She chuckled and used a single red fingernail to make a scratch on Xiao Bojian\u2019s pale chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were unexpectedly impressive, Mr Scholar. This madam almost fainted just now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian was currently holding a curvy and mature woman in his embrace. Disgust flashed across his eyes again. A corner of his lips lifted up and he blew a puff of warm air into the woman\u2019s ear. His palm slid down to the woman\u2019s full bosom and he gave it a hard squeeze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a good thing that I can satisfy you so well?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman laughed at his words, her well-rounded body jiggling with the effort. She lifted a leg onto Xiao Bojian\u2019s body and wriggled about seductively.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis madam does like your <i>impressive</i> self~\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian suddenly pushed the woman away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about the matter I entrusted to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was finally unable to conceal the iciness of his tone.</p><br/><p>If not for the woman\u2019s presence, he would have immediately jumped into the bathtub and scrubbed himself clean.</p><br/><p>The woman let out another wanton chuckle and clung to him once again. She sprawled over Xiao Bojian\u2019s naked back, her hand wandering down his smooth skin, lower and lower\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Xiao, don\u2019t you trust in this madam\u2019s work? How will you thank me this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the woman finished speaking, Xiao Bojian felt an important part of his body grasped by a smooth hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

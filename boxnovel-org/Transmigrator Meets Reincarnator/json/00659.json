I\u2019m just a messenger sent from Fourth Prince, here to inform you of some facts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian turned a confused look on Sima Hui.</p><br/><p>Facts?</p><br/><p>When Sima Hui noticed the dazed look on Chu Lian\u2019s cute little face, she knew instantly that her silly friend wasn\u2019t in the know.</p><br/><p>She sighed inwardly, cursing at He Changdi in her mind for keeping everything hidden from his wife. That man had suppressed all his bitterness and hatred in his heart. If not for this special situation and Prince Jin\u2019s inside knowledge, then this couple\u2019s relationship might really have gone beyond the point of repair.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe silver mine that He Changdi and Prince Jin have been hiding at the north is being investigated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Was she joking?! A silver mine?! The discovery of any silver mines had to be reported to the court immediately so that the Ministry of Revenue could make an official report of it to the emperor. The emperor himself would then order the cabinet to pick a few suitable officials to lead a team to develop the mine.</p><br/><p>The law here was that no one could develop mines on their own, even the princes!</p><br/><p>He Changdi was way too bold! He actually developed a private mine of his own with Prince Jin!</p><br/><p>Thinking back to when they were in the north and how He Changdi\u2019s subordinates had kept disappearing, a chill sprung up in Chu Lian\u2019s heart. It was her fault for not reading the story to the end and not finding out if there was anything information related to the silver mine.</p><br/><p>No wonder he had been so generous with his money that time. He had bought her accessories and even that storefront\u2026 When she had asked, all he had said that the money was his and that he had gotten it through legitimate means that had to be kept secret.</p><br/><p>Well, now she knew exactly what it had to be kept secret. That money had come from the silver in his illegal mine!</p><br/><p>If the emperor really wanted to pursue the matter, he could definitely mete out a heavy punishment. Taking away his official position as well as his noble rank were all within expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes His Majesty know?\u201d A tremor had developed in Chu Lian\u2019s voice when she spoke.</p><br/><p>Sima Hui nodded gravely, \u201cHis Majesty found out right before the spring hunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian immediately realised how serious the matter was. Her own expression took a turn for the worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, Imperial Concubine Wei knows about this matter as well,\u201d Sima Hui calmly added on a bombshell that gave Chu Lian the urge to fall to the ground\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t hold back her gasp.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry too much. Prince Jin and Marquis Anyuan have already controlled any news leaking about this matter and there aren\u2019t many who know about it. His Majesty has also quietly given them permission to hand over the silver mine to the court through the proper channels instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin was still the emperor\u2019s flesh and blood after all. Although this incident had turned the emperor\u2019s impression of him towards the negative, the benefits brought to the country by discovering a new silver mine were enough to grant him some merit for the achievement, enough for the emperor to overlook his mistake.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian suddenly thought back to the morning she had seen He Changdi accompanying Imperial Princess Leyao.</p><br/><p>Sima Hui seemed to have guessed at her train of thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cMarquis Anyuan has been accompanying Princess Leyao for the past two days, partly because of the emperor\u2019s order, as well as due to Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s threats. Imperial Princess Leyao got crippled because of her own reckless actions. Unfortunately, because Marquis Anyuan was nearby when it happened, Imperial Concubine Wei feels that it was Marquis Anyuan\u2019s fault for not saving her in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes opened wide, she really couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing.</p><br/><p>There were so many reasons behind his cold behaviour towards her the past few days?</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t He Changdi talk to her? When she wanted to open her heart to him, he had kept avoiding her.</p><br/><p>As if she were some scary beast.</p><br/><p>Sima Hui noticed that Chu Lian had lowered her head and closed her eyes. Her lips were pressed tightly together. The general knew that her friend had taken her words to heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m not going to say anything else. The rest is between you and your husband. If you have the time, go and have a good chat with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui stroked Chu Lian\u2019s smooth hair before lifting the curtain entrance of the carriage and jumping straight out, landing on her mount smoothly. She wielded her horse whip gracefully, and her horse shot forward to join the rest of the military officials further in front.</p><br/><p>When the spring hunt party passed the gates of the capital, they each returned to their own estates.</p><br/><p>Only a few officials still had to follow behind the emperor and enter the palace for further orders. Chu Lian was intending to wait at Xuanwu Gate for He Changdi so that they could return home together. Unfortunately, Laiyue came out with a special message from He Changdi, telling her to head home first.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian thought it over for a moment before shooting a look at Laiyue, who was waiting respectfully at the side. Instead of instructing the driver or the guards to move, she started questioning He Changdi\u2019s manservant, \u201cWhere did you go last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue looked up in shock over the question, but quickly lowered his head again to hide the flash of panic in his eyes. He tried his best to calm down and answered, \u201cReplying to Third Young Madam, this servant didn\u2019t go anywhere, this servant went to sleep the moment it got dark?\u201d</p><br/><p>The usual soft and watery gaze in Chu Lian\u2019s eyes was gone, replaced by a frigid glare that could rival her husband\u2019s. When it landed on Laiyue\u2019s frame, he couldn\u2019t bear the pressure and started trembling uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Laiyue\u2019s head shrunk even lower. Chu Lian didn\u2019t continue speaking and simply continued looking at him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She frowned; the novel had only mentioned Royal Princess Duanjia a few times, and she hadn\u2019t even properly made an entrance in the scenes that Chu Lian had read. She didn\u2019t know much about Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s personality or Prince Wei\u2019s estate.</p><br/><p>However, since it was a royal princess who had sent her a proper invite, it wouldn\u2019t be good if she rejected it.</p><br/><p>There were many noble ladies in the capital who would love to get connected to Royal Princess Duanjia, but weren\u2019t able to. Besides, Chu Lian didn\u2019t hold any ill will towards her.</p><br/><p>After accepting Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s invite, Senior Servant Gui and Senior Servant Zhong were happy as well.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia was famed for being detached from the social circles of the nobility. At most, she would occasionally mix with some of the ladies from the imperial family, but she didn\u2019t have any known close friends amongst the nobility. Prince Wei was someone that even the most favoured courtiers would have to pay respects to, so if Chu Lian could form a connection with Royal Princess Duanjia, even House Jing\u2019an\u2019s prestige would rise a level.</p><br/><p>Dinner was at Qingxi Hall tonight. When Chu Lian arrived at the entrance, she could hear laughter coming from within.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian walked in curiously, and Matriarch He waved her over. \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, come over, we were just talking about you!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the exception of Madam Zou\u2019s two daughters, Chu Lian was the youngest amongst them. She obediently greeted all her seniors before she was pulled by Matriarch He to sit on a soft chair just one step below hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, what were you talking about me?\u201d Her inquisitive wide eyes made the matriarch smile again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eldest brother was just talking about those longevity peach buns you made at the Dingyuan Estate! Grandmother tried them today as well; they\u2019re really tasty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled back and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s good that Grandmother likes them! I\u2019ll make more interesting ones for Grandmother\u2019s birthday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this, so those longevity peach buns weren\u2019t even the best ones. There are more interesting ones to be had!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the parlour laughed together. Chu Lian\u2019s sharp gaze swept over each member and picked out some unhappiness in Madam Zou\u2019s eyes, so she quickly changed the topic. \u201cSecond Brother has come back early today. I heard that we\u2019re having venison for the banquet! Granddaughter-in-Law can\u2019t wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Chu Lian changed the topic, she glanced at Madam Zou again and noticed the lightening of her expression.</p><br/><p>However, He Changqi just had to add fuel to the fire at this moment. \u201cThird Sister-in-Law, since you know how to make those fine pastries, do you know how to cook a better dish of venison?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian cried out in her heart. Madam Zou was already starting to dislike her, but her eldest brother just had to add that line.</p><br/><p>\u201cVenison\u2019s quite rare, so Sister-in-Law doesn\u2019t have any secret recipes for venison.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian finished speaking, He Changqi\u2019s face practically radiated disappointment.</p><br/><p>Following that, the family ate their dinner together. Chu Lian didn\u2019t want her eldest sister-in-law to feel like she was taking the spotlight, so she didn\u2019t speak much during the meal, except to reply the matriarch.</p><br/><p>When she returned to Songtao Court afterwards, Chu Lian patted her chest in relief without minding her image one bit.</p><br/><p>She had been scared to bits! She hadn\u2019t thought that just making some desserts would be enough to draw her eldest sister-in-law\u2019s jealousy. It looked like her journey to become a peaceful layabout in the inner court wouldn\u2019t be that easy.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hadn\u2019t even mentioned Lady Yang\u2019s gift of a coral bracelet and Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s invite to her estate in front of the family. She wondered if Madam Zou might misunderstand if she had spoken of it just now.</p><br/><p>After she had thought it through, Chu Lian decided to tell the matriarch alone when she made her morning greetings at Qingxi Hall the next day.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia had invited her to meet at her estate on the twenty-sixth of the month; there were still two days left to prepare, so it wasn\u2019t too urgent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

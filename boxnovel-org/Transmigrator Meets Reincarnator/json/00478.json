By the time she was able to overcome that short instant of confusion, He Sanlang had already tried placing a gentle kiss on her soft lips. </p><br/><p>Chu Lian immediately reacted by turning her head to avoid it.</p><br/><p>Her temper piqued, she said, \u201cHe Changdi, you lied to me last night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her whole body was wrapped up in the blanket within his embrace. She couldn\u2019t move at all. At this moment, she could only move her lips. He Changdi couldn\u2019t hold back his chuckles when he saw her flushed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian recalled his shameless and insatiable demands from last night, she gnashed her teeth in frustration. However, she had already experienced for herself how well he could twist his words. Moreover, they were lying together on the bed right now and her whole body was still aching. She couldn\u2019t afford to provoke him.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pouted and turned her head away. She didn\u2019t want to answer his question.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang stared at her reddened earlobe for a moment. He lowered his head to suck on it, his warm breath puffing over Chu Lian\u2019s ear as he whispered huskily, \u201cIt was my bad last night. Does it still hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>The blush on Chu Lian\u2019s ears extended to her entire face after hearing his question, especially since they were in such an intimate pose.</p><br/><p>She pursed her lips together and remained silent. It was too embarrassing to talk about this.</p><br/><p>Moreover, He Changdi wasn\u2019t a doctor. He wouldn\u2019t be able to help even if she told him that it was hurting.</p><br/><p>When He Sanlang saw that his wife was evading his gaze with a bashful look, he could guess what her answer would have been.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was worried about her, so he suggested, \u201cDon\u2019t go over to visit Grandmother and Mother this morning. I\u2019ll send someone to let them know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes widened and she immediately shook her head upon hearing his suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had been completely fine and healthy yesterday. If she didn\u2019t visit her elders today for the usual morning greetings, what would everyone else think? </p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to discuss this topic with him any longer. She shifted her position and looked at the handsome man beside her. She brought up her own question, \u201cYou went out to exercise in the morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>A spark of discomfort flashed through He Changdi\u2019s deep eyes, but he quickly recovered his usual calm.</p><br/><p>He squeezed the lovely woman in his embrace, \u201cMm, it\u2019s an old habit I\u2019ve had even before I went to the north. When I joined the northern border troops later, Uncle Qian was really strict, so the time I spent on training became even longer.\u201d </p><br/><p>He Sanlang didn\u2019t dare to speak the truth.</p><br/><p>Actually, after consummating their marriage, he had been too excited to fall to asleep last night. He held her in his arms and just stared at her all night and only managed to nap for about 3 hours.</p><br/><p>When he had woken up, it was still dark outside. Chu Lian had been sleeping on his chest with her rosy cheeks, fair skin, and bright red lips. Moreover, her nightclothes had gotten a little disheveled in her sleep. A man\u2019s lust was the strongest in the morning. He Sanlang was also at the age when his body was full of vigour. With his beloved wife sleeping in his arms, it was unbearable.</p><br/><p>However, afraid of hurting Chu Lian, He Sanlang pursed his lips with a grim expression and headed out to the martial arts arena to vent\u2026 Ahem\u2026 He also paid a visit to Great Doctor Miao on the way.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded without noticing the hidden meaning in He Changdi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>She wriggled a little and complained, \u201cHe Changdi, let go of me. It\u2019s getting late. I need to get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Chu Lian was struggling, He Changdi suddenly bent down and whispered something into her ear.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian instantly froze, the healthy blush on her face instantly fading to a pale pallor. She seriously wanted to strangle He Changdi right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026..You actually went to look for Great Doctor Miao!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

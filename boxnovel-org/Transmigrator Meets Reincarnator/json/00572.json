This time, I\u2019ll open a restaurant specialising in roast duck! I\u2019m going to be selling the roast duck I made at Prince Wei\u2019s estate. You\u2019ve already tried it, so what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang burst into a bout of open laughter. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019m going to be receiving complaints from Fourth Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>Confused, Chu Lian tilted her head, but she immediately caught on. \u201cPrince Jin is the owner of Yuehong Restaurant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Yuehong Restaurant famed for having the best roast duck in the capital?</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia had brought her there for a meal last year, but the taste of their duck was nothing to write home about.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that even better? Prince Jin is rich anyways, and that Yuehong Restaurant only has a single signature dish. Besides, the restaurant I\u2019m going to open won\u2019t just be selling roast duck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling helpless, He Changdi said, \u201cThis time, I\u2019ll find you some helpers, so don\u2019t push yourself to take care of everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were two downsides if Chu Lian personally managed the restaurant. Firstly, it\u2019d be tough on her. Secondly, it wouldn\u2019t reflect well on her since she had given the broken Guilin Restaurant away.</p><br/><p>If it was left to someone else to manage, even if people suspected them, they wouldn\u2019t go running their mouths off if they didn\u2019t have any solid evidence. This would also serve to protect the tentative peace between Chu Lian and Matriarch He on the surface.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian knew that He Changdi was doing this for her own good, so she didn\u2019t object. When the time came for it to open, she could just make a few covert trips there to keep an eye on things.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang reached out to pull Chu Lian into his embrace. \u201cWe\u2019ll move out once Father returns.\u201d</p><br/><p>Caught off guard by this sudden statement, Chu Lian\u2019s eyes went wide. She put her hand on his chest and asked, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mind immediately rejected this possibility. Although Count Jing\u2019an had three sons, the eldest had just divorced and had no heirs. The second one was a stubborn man who still hadn\u2019t married. She and He Changdi may have gotten married last year, but they had only consummated their marriage recently. Other than that, there was only the elderly Matriarch He and her mother-in-law, who had only just recovered. It wouldn\u2019t be reasonable for the third branch to move out at this point of time.</p><br/><p>He Changdi kept his eyes on his wife\u2019s face. When he noticed that the joy from receiving the deeds paled in comparison to the news of them moving out, he became even more resolute with regards to this decision.</p><br/><p>Since his aunt and cousin had moved in, his grandmother had become increasingly paranoid. There was a saying amongst the common folk that some things were better with distance.</p><br/><p>It actually wasn\u2019t normal for a family of dual nobilities to live under one roof. Now that he had become a marquis, he could leave this house to his father once his father returned. He had his own ways to convince his father to let the two of them move out. Second Brother couldn\u2019t remain single forever either, so Father would make the decision for him. With Mother\u2019s health improving day by day, there wasn\u2019t much left for him to worry about in House Jing\u2019an.</p><br/><p>After moving out with his wife, Chu Lian would then be the one to handle their estate, so he would no longer have to be stuck between his wife and his grandmother.</p><br/><p>He Changdi stroked her hair. \u201cI\u2019m your husband. Have I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mood immediately brightened up. She didn\u2019t want to interfere with how He Changdi was going to persuade his parents, so she would just wait to move out with him.</p><br/><p>The couple chatted for a while longer before going to have a meal together.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

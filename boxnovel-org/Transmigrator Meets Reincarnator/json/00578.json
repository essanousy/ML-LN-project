He mercilessly rejected his brother, \u201cSecond Brother, if you want to keep drinking, you can do it by yourself. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m heading back to my place to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, He Changjue was a stubborn one. He continued hanging onto He Changdi\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it just because Third Sister-in-Law might be waiting up for you? Don\u2019t worry! It\u2019s already this late, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s already gone to bed!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi chuckled coldly, \u201cSomeone who\u2019s still single won\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s words stirred up the hornet\u2019s nest. He Changjue still had enough consciousness left to recognise the insult. Furthermore, his path to love had never been smooth. His brother\u2019s mocking tipped him over the edge and he leaped up to attack He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Of course, He Changdi was no pushover. They started brawling noisily right there in the study.</p><br/><p>Perhaps due to their drunkenness, the brothers fought fiercely.</p><br/><p>The maidservant waiting outside was pale with fright. She hurriedly ran off to find the steward. The steward was already old, so there was no way he could pull apart his two masters. In the end, he ordered some servants to bring the family soldiers here to stop their fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat! Don\u2019t you dare show off with your wife in front of me in the future, or I\u2019ll knock all your teeth out!\u201d He Erlang was still scolding his little brother when they were pulled apart, the very picture of a drunk maniac.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had suffered a punch of the corner of his lips, which was starting to bruise. However, at least he had left Erlang in much worse shape. He shifted his jaw and muttered \u2018idiot\u2019 under his breath. Just as he was about to return to the inner court to look for his wife, the steward stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Second Young Master, Third Young Master, please, drink a bowl of sobering soup before you head back to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a maidservant standing behind the assistant steward with a food container in hand.</p><br/><p>When the steward finished speaking, the maidservant hurried forward and set down the box on the table. She brought out two warm bowls of sobering soup and offered one each to He Changjue and He Changdi.</p><br/><p>After that brief bout, both brothers were a little thirsty. He Changjue took the bowl and downed it in one gulp. He even had another two cups of tea in addition.</p><br/><p>He Changdi took up the porcelain bowl. When he put it to his mouth, he frowned. The smell of this sobering soup was strange.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t like drinking these types of medicinal soups, so he only had less than half the bowl.</p><br/><p>When he returned to the estate, he had already sent someone to Songtao Court to ask about his wife. The person he sent returned to say that Third Young Madam had already gone to bed.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang escorted his brother to the side room in the study and waited until the servants had helped him out of his clothes and laid him in bed.</p><br/><p>The assistant steward drew closer with a smile, \u201cThird Young Master, would you like to rest here in the outer court, or return to the inner court tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Chu Lian was already asleep, He Changdi told the steward to arrange a side room for him in the outer court as well.</p><br/><p>The assistant steward personally led He Sanlang to the side room on the left of the main study.</p><br/><p>After he entered the room, He Changdi came out again in a few minutes. He told the manservant guarding the door outside, \u201cPrepare the room next to Second Brother. I\u2019ll sleep over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manservant quickly ran off to follow his orders.</p><br/><p>While He Erlang was a good drinker, he became unreliable once he was high. He Sanlang was worried that something would happen to him in the night, so he decided to watch over his brother instead.</p><br/><p>By the time he finally laid down to rest, it was already an hour later.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had gotten married, He Changdi hadn\u2019t spent many nights in the main study in the outer court. He had also slept in this particular side room a few times before. However, for some reason, it felt uncomfortable this time.</p><br/><p>The blankets didn\u2019t feel as soft, the bedding wasn\u2019t comfortable enough, his sides were empty, making him feel that the entire room was too empty and quiet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

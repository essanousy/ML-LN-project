However, she had arranged for He Erlang to be the one. She had no idea why it had suddenly turned into He Dalang!</p><br/><p>However, since her mother was casting her suspicions on her now, she couldn\u2019t admit to that.</p><br/><p>In order to finish up her plans, she had no choice but to use He Dalang now.</p><br/><p>He Changqi was the eldest grandson of House Jing\u2019an. He was going to inherit the countship in the future. If she was really able to marry Miss Zhen to him, it wouldn\u2019t be that bad of a choice compared to her original plans.</p><br/><p>He Ying\u2019s target shifted in the span of a few seconds of thinking.</p><br/><p>Anyway, things had already happened. She just had to push Miss Zhen onto He Dalang no matter what.</p><br/><p>He Ying refused to speak. She only continued crying in sobs, annoying the matriarch even further.</p><br/><p>The problem at hand was tricky. The victim here was her granddaughter, who had only been living in the estate for a few months. However, in that short amount of time, that lovely flower had been plucked. Pan Nianzhen didn\u2019t have much status to begin with. Now that her body had been ruined, who could she marry?</p><br/><p>Even if they managed to get her married, she would only be a disgrace to House Jing\u2019an.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He bowed her head. She caught sight of her eldest grandson from the corner of her eyes.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have any heirs and he had just divorced. Even though he was nearing thirty, his previous wife had only left him two daughters.</p><br/><p>Miss Zhen was Dalang\u2019s cousin and he had interacted with her a few times before. Dalang was meant to inherit the title of Count Jing\u2019an, so he couldn\u2019t stay single forever. He had to have an heir someday.</p><br/><p>Compared to bringing in an arrogant young noble miss from the outside, why not simply give Miss Zhen to him in marriage? Miss Zhen was still young, so surely she would be able to give him a heir?</p><br/><p>Eldest Madam\u2019s non-stop crying had made everyone fidgety.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked at He Changdi.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang took in the ring of spectators in the parlour with his cold eyes and understood that he was the only one who could do something now.</p><br/><p>His eldest brother was still lost and blank. He hadn\u2019t recovered from his shock at all. His second brother was still sound asleep. His mother was too soft and she wasn\u2019t good at sticking her head out in these kinds of matters.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian did have that capability, but she was the youngest here and it wouldn\u2019t be easy for her to stand out. He Changdi couldn\u2019t bear to have his wife stand out again to face the crowd anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, stop crying. I\u2019ll send someone to investigate the details of this matter. If it\u2019s Eldest Brother\u2019s fault, he\u2019ll definitely take responsibility as a man. However, if I find out that this was all part of some unsavoury plot, then don\u2019t blame me for not giving face to relatives!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s voice was as icy as the tundra. He Ying couldn\u2019t help but twitch.</p><br/><p>She shot a quick, fearful glance at He Changdi, guilt rising in her heart.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s face had lost all colour. In this short amount of time, it seemed like her hair had turned more white and the wrinkles on her face had deepened.</p><br/><p>Since her youngest grandson had volunteered to take on the matter, she nodded in agreement. As much as she wanted to oversee the resolution of this, she didn\u2019t have the energy any longer.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He waved her hand weakly to dismiss them all. She spoke with some difficulty, her age clearly catching up, \u201cThen I\u2019ll leave this matter to Sanlang. The sun hasn\u2019t risen yet. Return to your beds and get some rest. There\u2019s no need to come here for morning greetings tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she was done speaking, Matriarch He hobbled towards her bedroom with the help of Muxiang and another handmaid.</p><br/><p>He Ying tried to follow behind her, but she was stopped by the maidservant guarding the door.</p><br/><p>Apology showed on the maidservant\u2019s face, \u201cEldest Madam, the matriarch isn\u2019t feeling well. Please allow her to have some rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying wanted to barge in regardless, but Senior Servant Liu arrived just in time to persuade her otherwise.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

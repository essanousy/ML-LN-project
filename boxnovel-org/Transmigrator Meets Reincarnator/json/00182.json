It was still dusk. Under the cover of the tent flap, which blocked the wind from reaching them, they could use the fading light to have a rough meal of army fare.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo had his two assistants sit down first before pointing at the three bowls on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tiring day, let\u2019s just eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi and Xiao Yuhong didn\u2019t stand on courtesy and picked up some chopsticks to begin wolfing down their food.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s dinner was Chinese olive porridge with some cabbage thrown in. There were two wheat pancakes thrown on top of the porridge- and no meat. The porridge itself was simply flavoured with a little bit of coarse salt. Since it was the lowest quality of salt, there was a strange taste to it as well.</p><br/><p>With this kind of food, they couldn\u2019t be picky about the taste. They could only use it to fill their stomachs out of a lack of better options.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuhong finished off a wheat pancake in two or three bites. When he tried to swallow it down, it got stuck in his throat. He had to gulp down quite a few mouthfuls of the porridge before he could push that piece of pancake down into his stomach.</p><br/><p>His face was flushed red from the exertion, and he stared into his bowl in a daze.</p><br/><p>Although he looked as strong as a bull, he was younger than He Changdi by a year at only nineteen years old. He had joined the army just last year, and his family was also a military official house. Although his family had been strict with his education, he had never lacked for any sort of food ever since he was young.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Guo, Brother He, at every meal time, I really miss eating the meat that my mother cooked. Back at home, I still thought that that meat was too fatty and oily. If I could have a whole pot of it now, I\u2019d finish it all up and lick it clean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo found it funny and pointed at his bowl. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You still have half your bowl left. If you can\u2019t finish it, give it to me; I\u2019ll help you eat it up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuhong quickly pulled his bowl into a protective embrace, just like a little puppy trying to protect its food. The others couldn\u2019t hold back their laughter at the sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! Brother Guo, I\u2019m not done yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to eat meat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there isn\u2019t any! If there was meat, who would eat this porridge or these pancakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi held his bowl and slowly ate his meal. Although he ate pretty quickly, he didn\u2019t look like a starving wolf at all, and even seemed to have an elegant grace in his actions.</p><br/><p>It was just his beard that seemed a little inconvenient. Some porridge would get on it from time to time. He Changdi simply buried his head and ate his meal, acting deaf to the conversation of the two people beside him.</p><br/><p>Right after Captain Guo and Xiao Yuhong finished talking, a man\u2019s voice joined in, easy like a refreshing breeze. \u201cWho says there\u2019s no meat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? There\u2019s meat?\u201d Xiao Yuhong immediately stood up, his eyes almost shining red from his hunger. He hadn\u2019t had a bite of meat for months now. Thanks to his excitement, his small eyes had grown wide.</p><br/><p>The man who spoke walked over with an empty bowl. He was about as tall as He Changdi, but without a beard on his face. He was also wearing a lieutenant\u2019s uniform, but he was clearly older than He Changdi by a whole decade. He was the third lieutenant under Captain Guo\u2019s command, Zhang Mai.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai had been exempted from training today due to an old wound flaring up. After resting in his tent for half the day, he had wandered over to the cookhouse for dinner.</p><br/><p>For some reason, the previously silent He Changdi suddenly froze.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuhong was practically drooling from the thought of having meat to eat. He quickly moved over to Zhang Mai, face sticking out as if he could smell the meat. He pleaded in a friendly tone, \u201cBrother Zhang, you just said that there\u2019s meat to eat. You can\u2019t forget about your brother here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai smiled mysteriously before reaching out with one finger and pointing at the now rigid He Changdi.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After a moment, he had already reported the sequence of events in detail to the gloomy-looking Emperor beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNanzhang? Prince Hexi\u2019s daughters? Anmin?\u201d The emperor raised his voice as he said those names. He Lin couldn\u2019t help but tremble when hearing his tone.</p><br/><p>He Lin vaguely knew that those noble misses were going to suffer the consequences, but he didn\u2019t dare say anything more.</p><br/><p>A moment later, He Lin asked in a soft voice, \u201cYour Majesty, Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s injury\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSend someone to notify Imperial Concubine Wei. We\u2019re tired, so We\u2019re going back to my tent to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this servant understands.\u201d He Lin quickly left with two imperial guards.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei had already come to greet the emperor when he arrived at the tent with his imperial guards.</p><br/><p>The emperor glanced at Eunuch Wei and knew that he had probably already heard the news. \u201cDon\u2019t ask. We\u2019ll talk after entering the tent. There\u2019s something We need you to handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty. This old servant understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia followed after Chu Lian when she returned to her tent.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei had even found a female physician with good medical skills to examine Chu Lian again. The female physician also inspected the wounds on her body that had been inconvenient for the male imperial physician to examine.</p><br/><p>The physician left a high-quality ointment and prescription. Wenqing helped Chu Lian apply the ointment, while Wenlan went to brew the medicine.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia was sitting beside the bed. She held onto Chu Lian\u2019s hand, a tinge of fear still evident in her voice as she said, \u201cChu Liu, you really scared me. If anything bad had happened to you this time, I would have died of guilt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian forced a smile. \u201cRoyal Princess, you shouldn\u2019t say that. Who could have thought that such an accident would occur?\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance to ask you at the polo field, so tell me more about what happened at that time. Why did those two brats, Dong\u2019er and Nan\u2019er, attack you? If I remembered correctly, you\u2019ve never interacted with them before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head. She really didn\u2019t have any relationship nor conflict with Prince Hexi\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Prince Hexi\u2019s twin daughters had good reputations in public. They were known to be obedient, intelligent, and talented.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t understand why Prince Hexi\u2019s daughters would harm her at this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it has something to do with Anmin? Anmin is very close with Leyao, so was it Leyao\u2019s idea?\u201d Royal Princess Duanjia made a guess.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei tapped Royal Princess Duanjia on the shoulder. \u201cAlthough Leyao is ill-natured and spoiled, she isn\u2019t someone who knows how to scheme. This wasn\u2019t something that she would think of doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Wei was right. To put it bluntly, Imperial Princess Leyao was a brainless idiot. This was a detailed plan that had started with the mention of polo and evolved into an actual polo match among the noble ladies. There was also the limit to the selection of players for the match that had made them pick Chu Lian for the team. Lastly, they had targeted Chu Lian on the field. This was a plan with many linked parts. If any one part within this plan failed, then Chu Lian wouldn\u2019t be hurt.</p><br/><p>In conclusion, this wasn\u2019t something that Imperial Princess Leyao could devise with that brain of hers.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Imperial Princess Leyao hadn\u2019t been at the scene. Thus, it was even more impossible.</p><br/><p>It also couldn\u2019t be Imperial Concubine Wei. During the process of Chu Lian being injured and rescued, her eyes were full of surprise and shock. Princess Wei was right beside her at that time. It wasn\u2019t something that she could fake.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho could it be then! I\u2019ll definitely find that culprit to avenge Chu Liu.\u201d Royal Princess Duanjia clenched her fist.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei sighed helplessly. She patted Royal Princess Duanjia, and then Chu Lian. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t be rash. This doesn\u2019t seem like a simple matter. We should give this matter some more thought before coming to a conclusion.\u201d After saying that, she looked towards her daughter. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll definitely find the truth and help you avenge Jinyi.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Princess Wei\u2019s words, Royal Princess Duanjia immediately drooped. Even her shoulders hung low.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia was guilt-ridden because she felt responsible for Chu Lian getting injured this time.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei understood her daughter\u2019s feelings. \u201cAlright, Jinyi is probably tired after suffering such a fright. We should leave and let her get some proper rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia helped Princess Wei stand up. She felt reluctant to part with Chu Lian and said, \u201cChu Liu, you should quickly lie down and sleep. I\u2019ll come over to see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian agreed with a voice filled with fatigue.</p><br/><p>When Royal Princess Duanjia and Princess Wei arrived at the entrance of the tent, Duanjia abruptly stopped and asked with creased brows, \u201cWhere\u2019s Marquis Anyuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard, who was standing at the entrance, just shook his head in reply.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia immediately clenched her fists. \u201cThat scumbag! Chu Liu is already injured and he\u2019s still not coming back!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi couldn\u2019t possibly be accompanying the emperor because the emperor had already returned to his tent! How could He Changdi still be wandering around outside?!</p><br/><p>Princess Wei\u2019s expression also turned slightly grim, but she wasn\u2019t as impulsive as Royal Princess Duanjia. However, she silently took note of this matter in her mind.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian laid down with a soft and comfortable pillow behind her. She was also covered with a warm blanket. However, despite the comforts around her, there was a terrible expression on her face.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but recall the moment He Changdi had turned to leave with Imperial Princess Leyao in his arms.</p><br/><p>She rang the bell beside her bed and Wenqing immediately rushed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Madam, do you feel uncomfortable anywhere? Please bear with it for a little longer. The medicine will be ready soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head and looked towards Wenqing, who was standing beside the bed, and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing was shocked, but she promptly answered with her head bowed, \u201cReplying to Third Young Madam, Third Young Master hasn\u2019t returned yet. This servant also doesn\u2019t know where he is. Laiyue hasn\u2019t come back either.\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving Wenqing\u2019s reply, Chu Lian feebly waved her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing looked worriedly at the back of the slender figure resting on the bed. She gave a light sigh and quietly went out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

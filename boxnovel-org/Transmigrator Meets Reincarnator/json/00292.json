However, his fever hadn\u2019t broken completely, although it was still better than yesterday.</p><br/><p>When he heard Chu Lian\u2019s words, a corner of his lips lifted up. His tone was full of disdain as he replied, \u201cWhat can a person like you help me with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian turned to him with an unhappy frown. \u201cWell, who knows what\u2019ll happen in the future! How do you know that I won\u2019t be able to help you? I can even help you right now! Wait here, I\u2019ll go and find something to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang turned towards the cave entrance. The rain had stopped, and there was a thick layer of snow on top of the dried grass outside the cave. He snorted inwardly. With this sort of bitterly cold weather in the middle of a mountain forest, it was going to be impossible for a weak little girl like Chu Lian to find anything edible.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had been watching He Changdi\u2019s expression, so she immediately noticed the disbelief and contempt on his face, which provoked her stubborn temper.</p><br/><p>Her cheeks puffed up as she said angrily, \u201cSit here and don\u2019t move! I\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Chu Lian took her big cloak with her as she quickly walked out of the cave. When she reached the entrance, the cold air immediately forced her sleepy mind to wake up all at once.</p><br/><p>Somewhat disturbed, Chu Lian shook her head and stomped her foot.</p><br/><p>What had gotten into her? Why was she so easily provoked by that beardy? He hadn\u2019t even really said anything to her and here she was, all ready to go out and look for food by herself.</p><br/><p>But now that she had already left the cave, she couldn\u2019t just return empty handed. Wouldn\u2019t that just make her die of embarrassment?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sighed and tried to calm herself down. She accepted her fate and picked a random direction before trudging off into the woods.</p><br/><p>After walking for some time, the scene in the cave played in her mind again. That beardy\u2019s voice seemed strangely familiar, as if she had heard it somewhere before. However, she couldn\u2019t recall exactly where\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head and set that matter aside. There were so many people who looked alike in this world, it wasn\u2019t a surprise if there were people who sounded the same, too. After reassuring herself, Chu Lian stopped thinking about it.</p><br/><p>He Changdi watched as Chu Lian\u2019s slender figure disappear from sight. Only then did his stiff body untense in relief.</p><br/><p>He looked up at the uneven surface of the cave wall, thoughts hidden in the unreadable depths of his eyes.</p><br/><p>However, after a short moment, he suddenly stood up. Due to his abrupt movement, he felt a wave of dizziness crash over his head, and he couldn\u2019t help but stumble. He Changdi immediately grabbed onto the cave wall for balance and shut his eyes. After resting for a while, his body felt better.</p><br/><p>Although He Sanlang\u2019s condition had improved since yesterday, he was still poisoned and feverish. The remaining toxins hadn\u2019t been cleared from his system yet, so his body was still weak. Actually, he was in very frail health right now, but when he thought of how Chu Lian had gone into the woods all by herself, he couldn\u2019t rest easy.</p><br/><p>Who knew if those crafty Tuhuns were still out there in the forest? What if Chu Lian encountered them? Even if there weren\u2019t Tuhuns around, the forest was a dangerous place in winter.</p><br/><p>He had risked his life to save Chu Lian\u2019s, so if anything happened to her now, wouldn\u2019t all his previous efforts go to waste?</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s expression was as gloomy as ever. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about everything that could go wrong, and so he used this twisted reasoning to cover up the concern he felt for Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>He Changdi bore with the weakness of his body and left the cave. He quickly found a place to leave a distress signal for his subordinates to find, and then began to track Chu Lian\u2019s footprints to follow after her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That worm came from within the fresh peach! Your Majesty, if it seems beyond belief, how about ordering someone to check the peach?\u201d</p><br/><p>Empress Shen shot a look at a middle-aged eunuch waiting on the side. In a moment, that middle-aged eunuch picked up the half of the peach that Chu Lian had placed on the table. As expected, he found a large hole where a worm had been near the center of the peach. The eunuch reported his finding, and after a few moments, he found that trouble-making, black, wriggling worm near the table\u2026</p><br/><p>When the handmaid saw that evidence to her claims had been found, her tense heart relaxed for a moment. She almost collapsed on the ground after losing all the strength in her body. \u201cIt was the Honoured Lady who tossed that worm onto this servant\u2019s hand, causing this servant to lose composure before Your Majesties. Your Majesty, please seek justice for this servant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian cast a sideways glance towards the handmaid who had suddenly become the victim. The corners of her lips curved upwards. This silly girl, did she think anyone here was stupid?</p><br/><p>As expected, Empress Shen had thought further. \u201cSo what you\u2019re trying to say is that Honoured Lady Jinyi purposely tried to lead you into a trap? You\u2019re just a lowly handmaid. What benefit is there for Honoured Lady Jinyi to harm you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The handmaid who had just found a moment to relax was suddenly plunged back into the depths of despair. Her eyes widened, and she couldn\u2019t speak for a long moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 This servant\u2026 does\u2026 doesn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was supposed to make longevity peach buns for the Chengping Emperor. The ingredients were all prepared by people in the palace. Furthermore, this handmaid was one of Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s servants. She had also been the one to wash those peaches before handing them over to Chu Lian. However, a disgusting worm had appeared in those supposedly fresh peaches, and Chu Lian was supposed to prepare the peaches herself\u2026 It was clear what had happened.</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei had tried to quickly get rid of this handmaid earlier, because she didn\u2019t want the handmaid to make a mistake and expose everything. Even those with the slightest bit of brains could guess what was going on.</p><br/><p>However, Empress Shen had stopped her with the intention of trapping Imperial Concubine Wei.</p><br/><p>Now that things had progressed to this step, it was as if Imperial Concubine Wei had been slapped in the face by Empress Shen right in front of the Emperor. Her face felt like it was on fire.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Empress Shen to speak, the Emperor ordered in a low tone. \u201cTake her out! Beat her to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Emperor\u2019s words were much more powerful than Empress Shen\u2019s or Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s. Before the handmaid could speak another word, she was immediately taken away by two guards dressed in black and dragged out.</p><br/><p>Next, the Chengping Emperor glanced at Chu Lian and how she was standing obediently to one side with her head lowered, merely watching the show. If Chu Lian had raised her head at this moment, she would have been able to see the strange glint in the Emperor\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cConcubine, you failed to teach your servants properly. When the Mid-Autumn Festival is over, you are grounded in your palace for half a month.\u201d The Chengping Emperor\u2019s tone sent chills down everyone\u2019s spine.</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei looked up at the Emperor in disbelief. However, the Emperor looked like a cold and unreachable ruler right now; nothing at all like the Emperor who had snuggled up with Imperial Concubine Wei earlier on the same sofa. </p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei looked at the Chengping Emperor with aggrieved eyes, hoping that that he would retract his order. However, the Emperor had already shifted his gaze away. Empress Shen looked gleeful. Right now, the only one in the palace who could vie with her for status was this Imperial Concubine Wei. This concubine had used so many little tricks in secret to fight with her. Who would have thought that a small matter like this would make Imperial Concubine Wei fall from grace? How could Empress Shen not be delighted?</p><br/><p>Following this line of thought, Empress Shen turned her head to look at Chu Lian, a miniscule hint of a smile on her face. As expected, a dog who would bite wouldn\u2019t bark. She had underestimated this Honoured Lady Jinyi.</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei had no other choice but to accept her punishment.</p><br/><p>The Emperor\u2019s gaze swept across the entire Tingyu Pavilion before he ordered, \u201cForget it. I no longer have any interest in this. Jinyi, go to your grandmother over at the Empress Dowager\u2019s palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian respectfully bowed and answered in agreement.</p><br/><p>However, before the crowd started to leave Tingyu Pavilion, a bell-like voice called out from outside the entrance. \u201cFather, Father! Yao\u2019er has come to greet you!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard that voice, the dark clouds in the Emperor\u2019s expression dissipated a little. He turned to the entrance, and in a short moment, a little girl in a pink court dress came running in like a little butterfly. Following that, she threw herself into the Emperor\u2019s welcoming embrace.</p><br/><p>The Emperor bent down slightly, his face full of tender love as he patted Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s hair gently. He asked her, \u201cLeyao, why have you come all the way here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao coquettishly answered, \u201cYao\u2019er missed Father, so Yao\u2019er asked the eunuchs and came over! Yao\u2019er hasn\u2019t seen Father for two whole days! Did Father miss Yao\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Emperor burst out into laughter, enjoying such a warm exchange with his daughter. \u201cFather misses you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao let out a bright smile. \u201cYao\u2019er knows that Father loves Yao\u2019er the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Emperor pinched his daughter\u2019s cheeks gently.</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei had been kneeling at the side. When she saw her daughter entering the hall, her expression relaxed and she heaved a sigh of relief in her heart.</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao looked around Tingyu Pavilion and ran into Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s embrace next. \u201cMother, what\u2019s wrong? Why are you kneeling on the floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei showed a slightly fatigued smile and combed through Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s slightly messy fringe. \u201cYao\u2019er, Mother made a mistake. Mother has to kneel on the floor in repentance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s eyes widened and she tried to pull her mother up from the ground. However, Imperial Concubine Wei didn\u2019t move. Imperial Princess Leyao ran up to the Emperor and hugged his arm, shaking it. \u201cFather, Mother didn\u2019t do it on purpose! Could you forgive Mother just this once?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chengping Emperor looked into Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s eyes and finally gave in. \u201cAlright, get up. If there\u2019s a next time, you won\u2019t be able to make up for it even if Leyao pleads for you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Delight bloomed on Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s face. She quickly said, \u201cThis humble one wouldn\u2019t dare. There won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Empress Shen was about to grind her teeth down from frustration. She couldn\u2019t believe that the Emperor had completely let go of his anger and pardoned Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s crime just because of two simple sentences from Imperial Princess Leyao!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

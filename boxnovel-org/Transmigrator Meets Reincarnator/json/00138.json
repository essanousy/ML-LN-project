It was going to be refreshing vegetarian wraps, paired with a light and salty vegetable porridge.</p><br/><p>After breakfast, Chu Lian noticed it was still early and went back to her little study to practise her calligraphy.</p><br/><p>She had some talent in calligraphy already, and she had experience in writing simplified Chinese words with pens. Now all she had to do was learn to use a brush and write in traditional Chinese words instead. She wasn\u2019t used to it at first, but after practising for a few days, she had no problems writing most of the commonly used words. However, it was impossible for her to write exactly like \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 had. </p><br/><p>Firstly, she wasn\u2019t good at copying. Secondly,there weren\u2019t many examples from the former host of this body that she could reference. Besides, she was herself and she wasn\u2019t going to try to imitate the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019. They were two completely different people in the first place!</p><br/><p>Although using a brush and writing in traditional Chinese words were easy enough, she still had a long way to go before her calligraphy could be anywhere close to passable.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was more used to using pens instead of brushes. She got Xiyan to find some goose feathers and made her own feather pens. When she wanted to practise writing fancier characters, or writing for longer amounts of time, she would switch to the feather pens.</p><br/><p>After filling up two sheets of paper with her calligraphy practice, Chu Lian made her way over to Qingxi Hall to give her daily greetings to the matriarch. Afterwards, she intended to stop by her mother-in-law\u2019s courtyard for a visit.</p><br/><p>Who could have known that Chu Lian would receive something she hadn\u2019t expected at all- a letter from He Changdi all the way from the northern border!</p><br/><p>Matriarch He had a wide smile on her face as she passed the letter over. She was acting just like she was watching her cute pair of grandchildren being lovey-dovey right in front of her.</p><br/><p>The corner of Chu Lian\u2019s mouth twitched. She kept her expression neutral as she took the letter, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to speak. The matriarch mistook this as Chu Lian simply being shy, so she dismissed her with a wave of a hand to let her read the letter in private. Matriarch He even reminded her to write a reply after she was finished reading. The man who had brought them the letters was still waiting to send everyone\u2019s replies back together to the northern border!</p><br/><p>Seeing Matriarch He\u2019s pleased expression, Chu Lian felt like she was out of her depth. When she recalled what Senior Servant Liu had told her last night while escorting her back to Songtao Court, Chu Lian\u2019s mood took a turn for the worse.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu\u2019s words played again in her mind. \u201cThird Young Madam, please don\u2019t blame this old servant for speaking up about this. The countess hasn\u2019t been in the best of health since the birth of Third Young Master, so this old servant was the one who took care of him from childhood. This old servant feels warm just watching the two of you interact so well. But now, Third Young Master must be suffering over at the northern border, and our Master can\u2019t help him either. He\u2019s all alone over there without a companion he can share his troubles with. Although it\u2019s been so hot as of late over here in the capital, it\u2019s actually terribly cold over there, especially at night. I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s impossible to survive without a jacket on. Third Young Master left in such a hurry, this old servant doesn\u2019t know if he brought enough supplies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Senior Servant Liu had dragged on and on in this vein, Chu Lian instantly understood. She only had one purpose; that was to make Chu Lian, as Sanlang\u2019s wife, send more care for the He Family\u2019s lonely, suffering Third Young Master.</p><br/><p>If she could be a caring and considerate wife and prepare some changes of clothing and such for her dear husband, it would be great.</p><br/><p>As much as Chu Lian wanted to roll her eyes, she couldn\u2019t say anything to Senior Servant Liu. She could tell that Senior Servant Liu genuinely cared for He Changdi. She treated him like her very own son.</p><br/><p>There was nothing wrong with those kinds of feelings.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian agreed to it. Despite how terribly He Changdi acted in front of her, she was still his legitimate wife. There were expectations she had to fulfill according to that role. As for that crazy husband of hers, pfft. As long as he wasn\u2019t around to disturb her, there was nothing to worry about.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s thoughts were plain and simple.</p><br/><p>When she returned to her study, Chu Lian sat alone at her desk. She measured the thickness of the envelope with her fingers; it seemed pretty thick. There must be quite a few pieces of paper in there!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

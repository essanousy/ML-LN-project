However, once she finished speaking, Chu Lian instantly understood what she had meant.</p><br/><p>She was extremely shocked, to put it lightly. Third Aunt-in-law was hinting at giving Miss Yuan to He Changdi as a concubine to bear children!</p><br/><p>What kind of mother was she? Why was she so desperate to give away her own daughter?</p><br/><p>Even if the prestige of the present House Ying had declined, a legitimate daughter of the family couldn\u2019t just be given away as a concubine, even to a highly ranked official! What was wrong with this Third Aunt-in-law\u2019s brain!</p><br/><p>The smile that Chu Lian had somehow managed to squeeze out completely disappeared after Third Aunt-in-law said those words.</p><br/><p>She really didn\u2019t want to bother with what these aunts of hers had to say, but she had to nip things in the bud and give them a direct response now.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, I know that you\u2019re thinking for my sake. However, my husband has already said that we\u2019re still young and that he\u2019s not in a rush to have children right now. It\u2019s best to let nature take its course. Besides, you should know about the rules of the He Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s response was a merciless slap to everyone\u2019s face. It was also a firm rejection to Third Aunt-in-law\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>Out of all the women present, not a single one of their husbands was without a concubine or even a bedservant. Even the old madam\u2019s husband, Duke Ying, had two maidservants under the age of twenty to \u2018prepare his ink\u2019 in the study! Of course, the fact that there was a bevy of aging concubines in his harem went without saying.</p><br/><p>There were plenty of illegitimate children in this household. Chu Lian\u2019s father, Chu Qizheng, was considered the best amongst the husbands of House Ying. She and Chu Yuan didn\u2019t have any illegitimate siblings, but that was most likely because Chu Qizheng was lacking in vigour with old age\u2026</p><br/><p>Of all the women in the room, it was only Chu Lian\u2019s husband, He Changdi, who didn\u2019t have a concubine. It was written right in the rules of the He Family after all!</p><br/><p>All the noble madams who had been babbling away earlier instantly fell silent. The atmosphere of the entire parlour was instantly transformed into an awkward tension.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was Madam Rong who purposely gave off a loud cough and drew back everyone\u2019s attention. Madam Rong smiled and said, \u201cAunts, don\u2019t you feel ashamed as elders for envying a young lady like Miss Lian? It\u2019s also a blessing for our Chu Family that Miss Lian was able to marry so well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those who had more wits hastily chimed in and agreed with her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled slightly. It wasn\u2019t appropriate for her to say anymore right now. However, the old madam was smiling somewhat awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s getting late now. The coming of age ceremony will start soon. Everyone should get going now,\u201d Madam Rong took the chance to remind them.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room promptly stood up and walked towards the parlour in the outer court of the Ying Estate, where the coming of age ceremony was being held.</p><br/><p>Once the maidservants had helped the old madam out of the room, Madam Rang personally came over to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Madam Rong examined Chu Lian carefully from head to toe first, before she beamed with a genuine smile, \u201cMiss Lian, it\u2019s only been a few months since we last met and you\u2019ve become even more beautiful. It\u2019s no wonder that Marquis Anyuan wouldn\u2019t let you come back by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was undeniable that Madam Rong was good at speaking.</p><br/><p>With such a formidable daughter-in-law at the helm of the main branch, their inner court was likely much more organised than those of the other two branches.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian returned the smile, \u201cEldest Sister-in-law, don\u2019t tease me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Rong reached out and hooked her arm with Chu Lian\u2019s. They left the parlour of the inner court together, \u201cMiss Lian, I\u2019m busy today, so I can\u2019t take care of you. Could you go to the outer court with Miss Su?\u201d</p><br/><p>It might have been because of the previous incident at the Dingyuan Estate, but Chu Lian had a strange feeling that Madam Rong was being more careful and flattering towards her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded, \u201cEldest Sister-in-law, please go ahead since you\u2019re so busy. You don\u2019t have to worry about me. I\u2019ll look for Fifth Sister right now and go to the outer court with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Rong gave her an apologetic smile before making a hasty departure.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian left the old madam\u2019s courtyard and turned the corner, the first thing she spotted was Miss Su standing beside some rose bushes.</p><br/><p>Miss Su had become much thinner since the last time they had met.</p><br/><p>The baby fat on her cheeks had disappeared. Not only that, her cheeks were actually slightly sunken in. She didn\u2019t exactly look like the picture of health in this state.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian frowned. She hadn\u2019t expected Miss Su to have become so gaunt after just a few months.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth Sister,\u201d Chu Lian called out softly when she got closer.</p><br/><p>Miss Su snapped out of her light daze after hearing her voice. She turned towards Chu Lian\u2019s direction and gave a wan smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth Sister, why have you lost so much weight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Su shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I got wrapped up in some troublesome matters within the estate that I couldn\u2019t avoid, so I naturally lost some weight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Miss Su didn\u2019t want to talk about her troubles, Chu Lian didn\u2019t press the issue.</p><br/><p>Miss Su pulled Chu Lian\u2019s hand into her own and looked her over with a measuring gaze. The faint smile on her face became a touch more sincere, \u201cSixth Sister seems to be more lively than before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian forced a smile. How could she not be \u2018lively\u2019? She had to drink a nourishing tonic twice a day. He Changdi was still on leave, so he was eating with her everyday. With He Changdi watching her at mealtimes, she had to eat a lot more as compared to before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s chat over there,\u201d Miss Su held hands with Chu Lian and led her towards the outer court.</p><br/><p>There was a small garden just up in front. Everyone was gathered in the outer court right now, so there were barely any servants around in the inner court. It was quiet and serene in the garden, so it was a good place for a private chat.</p><br/><p>Miss Su sent a signal to the handmaid behind her with her eyes. The handmaid immediately bobbed in acknowledgement and retreated several steps, keeping a good distance from Miss Su and Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian could understand Miss Su\u2019s intention, so she waved at Wenqing and Wenlan to do the same.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

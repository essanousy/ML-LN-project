After throwing up that mid-afternoon, He Changdi hadn\u2019t eaten anything else. Now that he was being forced to drink some strange herbal soup, he was already filled to the brim with frustration.</p><br/><p>He Changdi no longer had the mood to continue reading the letters in front of him. Thus, he stood up and left the study.</p><br/><p>Laiyue, his personal manservant, was dozing off while guarding the door outside. He Changdi kicked him to relieve some of his frustration, startling Laiyue awake. He wiped away the drool at the corner of his mouth and hurriedly asked, \u201cYoung Master, where are you going at this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi cast a sideways glance at Laiyue and was about to reply that he was returning to his courtyard. However, he instantly remembered that the wicked woman, Chu Lian, was staying there, so he turned and headed to his mother\u2019s courtyard instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to visit Mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue scratched his head and followed behind Third Young Master, confused. There were three great occasions in a man\u2019s life: meeting a friend in a foreign land, getting married, and ranking on the imperial examination. Third Young Master had just gotten married and Third Young Madam was such a beauty. Why was Third Young Master walking around with such a dark look on his face, as if the entire world owed him three hundred taels of silver and no one was paying up?</p><br/><p>When He Changdi reached his mother\u2019s courtyard, Countess Jing\u2019an was currently walking about in her room with the support of one of her personal maidservants.</p><br/><p>Something interesting seemed to have occurred, as the bell-like laughter of her personal maidservant, Miaozhen, drifted out from the parlour.</p><br/><p>As He Sanlang walked closer, he could hear Countess Jing\u2019an talking and laughing with the servants by her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam, these candied kumquats that Third Young Madam sent over are really delicious!\u201d That was Miaozhen\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this old servant also thinks that they\u2019re good. Speaking critically, these candied kumquats look pretty and cheerful, and they even taste great. They won\u2019t lose out to the pastries that Cook Zhou makes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? I didn\u2019t think that these sweets could get such a high evaluation from you. Let me have one to try.\u201d Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s voice was clearly a little weak.</p><br/><p>Following that came the sound of the maidservants\u2019 footsteps.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s expression changed and he sprinted into his mother\u2019s room. When he saw the plate of candied kumquats that Miaozhen was about to bring to his mother, he reached out and knocked it away.</p><br/><p>The little dish immediately shattered, making a sharp, ear-piercing sound as it hit the ground. The translucent candied kumquats scattered all over the floor.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room was so shocked by He Changdi\u2019s sudden actions that they turned completely mute.</p><br/><p>It was Countess Jing\u2019an who recovered and reacted first. She stared at her youngest son with her brows slightly drawn together as she said, \u201cSanlang, what are you doing? Your wife personally delivered these to me this afternoon as a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi finally realised that he had acted too impulsively. However, upon thinking of the ploys that \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 had used in his past life, he felt that he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, you\u2019re not well. You have to be careful with what you eat. Don\u2019t let it affect your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one knows a man better than his own mother. Countess Jing\u2019an seemed to have detected something from He Changdi\u2019s flickering eyes. She sent away the servants in the room before she asked her son, \u201cI heard from Senior Servant Liu that you don\u2019t seem to be very happy with your wife. Is this true? Tell Mother why you\u2019re so unhappy with her. She came to visit me this afternoon, and she seems like a good child.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi was astounded. He inwardly sneered. Who would have thought that that wicked woman, Chu Lian, would actually try and play this game while he was away? She had even come to curry favour with his mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, don\u2019t think too much about it. Nothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m just worried about your health.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that He Changdi wasn\u2019t willing to speak the truth, Countess Jing\u2019an could only sigh. \u201cSanlang, Mother worries the most over you. If you don\u2019t pass your days in happiness, how can Mother relax?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s expression was extremely dark when he left Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s courtyard. By this point, he had already heard of what Chu Lian had done earlier in the afternoon. So she had been up to something while he wasn\u2019t around. He walked towards his courtyard in a huff.</p><br/><p>Laiyue scratched his head as he followed behind his master. He found that he really couldn\u2019t understand Third Young Master anymore.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian napped for an hour in a daze. She woke up in the most uncomfortable way, covered in sweat and stifled. Thus, she ordered Jingyan and Mingyan to prepare a hot bath for her.</p><br/><p>She had just entered the fragrant hot bath when she heard Mingyan\u2019s alarmed voice outside. \u201cThird Young Master, Third Young Master, it\u2019s not convenient to meet Third Young Madam at this time! Please wait for a moment before going in!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

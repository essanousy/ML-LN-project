Although she managed to force herself to eat a little bit of each dish in front of her, she could feel her limits and sensibly set down her chopsticks after a few bites.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang didn\u2019t say anything upon noticing her actions. He simply took her leftover wheat pancake and finished it.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blinked and watched as He Changdi ate all of her leftovers with a coldly handsome face. She felt both embarrassed and guilty at the same time.</p><br/><p>In order to lessen her awkwardness, Chu Lian tried to start up a conversation. \u201cSo this is what all the officers in this camp eat every day?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi finished drinking all the warm water left in the bowl and wiped his mouth with a handkerchief that Wenlan passed over before turning to look at the young and weak woman in front of him.</p><br/><p>The wicked woman\u2019s doe-like eyes were shining brightly, like a little creature filled with curiosity.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang shifted his gaze away as casually as he could before carefully replying, \u201cMm, even the great general is no exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wailed in her heart at the bleakness of his answer. However, she also found it strange. Even the unpaid volunteer forces formed to fight against sudden rebellions, like the Hunan Army from history, wouldn\u2019t be forced into conditions where they only had bean paste to eat and no grains at all. While He Sanlang\u2019s position wasn\u2019t very high, he was still a captain. She had come today with an imperial decree to bring them supplies, so Great General Qian had specially invited her to stay for a meal. They wouldn\u2019t normally welcome their guests with such poor fare, what more an Honoured Lady representing the Empress Dowager.</p><br/><p>However, all they had sent over were these dishes\u2026</p><br/><p>They had been given some salted meat and wheat pancakes at least. But what about the lowest ranked soldiers?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes abruptly widened into huge circles. She gulped and suddenly moved over to He Changdi\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>When Wenqing and Wenlan noticed their young madam\u2019s sudden action, they were stunned for a moment before their cheeks flushed red and they quickly retreated out of the tent.</p><br/><p>Absence really did make the heart grow fonder. Third Young Madam hadn\u2019t gotten enough alone time with Third Young Master.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian sat down next to He Changdi, she even squeezed closer to him, as if they weren\u2019t already close enough.</p><br/><p>All He Changdi could smell right now was Chu Lian\u2019s uniquely refreshing and sweet scent. His entire body froze instantly as he tried to figure out what Chu Lian was trying to do.</p><br/><p>He wanted to push the wicked woman away, but his hands just refused to listen to him.</p><br/><p>Her familiar scent drew him back to the memories of that wonderful kiss from before.</p><br/><p>The tips of He Sanlang\u2019s ears turned red and he gulped unconsciously, causing his Adam\u2019s apple to move noticeably.</p><br/><p>The depths of his pupils seemed to turn even darker as his eyes darted towards Chu Lian\u2019s tender, pink lips. However, Chu Lian\u2019s next words made him drop his wayward thoughts completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Sanlang, tell me honestly, is the border army running out of food?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s body seemed to have frozen into a statue-like stillness. His eyes narrowed dangerously and he grabbed Chu Lian\u2019s arm with his large hand. In a deep and icy tone, he questioned, \u201cHow do you know that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hadn\u2019t noticed his strange mood yet; her only reaction was to widen her eyes as shock filled her heart. So it was true!</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your manservant Laiyue follow you here to the northern border? How come I haven\u2019t seen him these few days?\u201d Laiyue definitely wasn\u2019t in the camp. Otherwise, he should have come out to welcome her in He Changdi\u2019s stead by now. However, he wasn\u2019t at Liangzhou\u2019s He Estate either\u2026 Chu Lian\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve sent him out to secure supplies?\u201d Chu Lian\u2019s bright and sparkling eyes were filled with certainty as she looked up at He Changdi.</p><br/><p>However, the sight that met her eyes was enough to make her tremble in fright.</p><br/><p>The look in He Sanlang\u2019s eyes was cold. He looked exactly like the day they had first met, back on their wedding night, as if he wanted to chew her up and spit out her blood. Back then, when he had almost strangled her to death\u2026</p><br/><p>Goosebumps rose on Chu Lian\u2019s head and she subconsciously took a step back, trying to distance herself from the danger before her.</p><br/><p>However, He Changdi maintained his tight hold on her upper arm and refused to let her move. His dangerous gaze was locked onto Chu Lian\u2019s eyes, as if he was trying to see into her heart and all her thoughts with his eyes alone!</p><br/><p>He asked again, \u201cHow. Do. You. Know. That!\u201d His tone was even more sinister than the first time.</p><br/><p>He had been able to make preparations in advance because he had experienced it in his previous life, but how had Chu Lian been able to find out about the lack of supplies?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

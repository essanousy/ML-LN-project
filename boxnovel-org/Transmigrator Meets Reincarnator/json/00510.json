She helplessly shook her head. Great Doctor Miao was too accustomed to acting as he liked. Although he had spoken up to defend her, it had backfired instead. Judging by the expression on the matriarch\u2019s face, it seemed that the misunderstanding between them had deepened.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao only realised that he should have put more thought into his words after the fact.</p><br/><p>However, there was no use in regretting it now. Words couldn\u2019t be taken back once thrown out.</p><br/><p>He made a cupped fist salute towards Matriarch He before finding an empty seat in the corners of the parlour and sitting down.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He wasn\u2019t in the mood to be angry with Great Doctor Miao right now. Her expression turned grim and she abruptly turned her gaze towards Chu Lian, who was seated beside He Changdi. She demanded with a thunderous shout, \u201cMadam Chu, do you still have anything to say for yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was out of Chu Lian\u2019s expectations that the matriarch\u2019s first reaction was to condemn her, let alone with such a hostile tone.</p><br/><p>This was likely all \u2018thanks\u2019 to Great Doctor Miao\u2019s previous remark.</p><br/><p>Likewise, He Changdi hadn\u2019t expected that Grandmother\u2019s mindset hadn\u2019t changed even after a whole night. It wasn\u2019t as if this incident was airtight. If Matriarch He had her wits about her, then she would have already realised the truth overnight.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s expression darkened. He was about to stand up to defend Chu Lian, but Chu Lian tugged at his hand and lightly shook her head.</p><br/><p>After that, she stood up in a calm and easy manner.</p><br/><p>There was a faint smile on her face, as if she wasn\u2019t facing a \u2018trial\u2019 and interrogation from all sides. Instead, her peaceful expression made it seem like she was enjoying a lakeside garden with beautiful scenery. She looked around leisurely. Her gaze stayed the longest on Madam Zou and Eldest Madam\u2019s faces, before she finally made eye contact with the matriarch\u2019s muddled yet sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a single trace of fear in Chu Lian\u2019s bright eyes. A moment later, her reply to the matriarch resounded in the parlour for everyone to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn reply to Grandmother, Granddaughter-in-Law has plenty to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s expression became even darker and uglier. Beside her, He Ying\u2019s temper was also provoked by Chu Lian\u2019s nonchalant attitude.</p><br/><p>She sneered coldly, \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, do you think that everyone will believe you just because you\u2019re acting this way? Let me warn you! Even if the child is safe, we won\u2019t pretend like this never happened! Mother, our estate can\u2019t tolerate the existence of such a cruel and vile woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying\u2019s words were very harsh. She had obviously said those words because she wanted to kick Chu Lian out of House Jing\u2019an and to have He Changdi divorce her.</p><br/><p>What a pity that she didn\u2019t have much in the way of smarts. The Empress Dowager herself had decreed He Changdi and Chu Lian\u2019s marriage. He Changdi wouldn\u2019t be allowed to divorce his wife as he liked. Furthermore, Chu Lian had a noble title on her that gave her the status of an imperial daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, please make sure to your brain before speaking in the future. Polish your eyes while you\u2019re at it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>When dealing with people like Eldest Madam, there was no need to reason with her and give her respect.</p><br/><p>Although Matriarch He knew that He Ying\u2019s words had been out of line, since He Ying was her very own daughter, she still sided with He Ying in the end. She reprimanded, \u201cMadam Chu, Miaozhen nearly had a miscarriage because she ate the candied hawthorns that you made! Though that child will be born an illegitimate child, but he\u2019s still your eldest brother-in-law\u2019s first son!\u201d</p><br/><p>The first person to feel guilt from the matriarch\u2019s words was Countess Jing\u2019an. She couldn\u2019t resist glancing at her youngest daughter-in-law, who was standing ramrod straight, \u201cMother, I\u2019m also at fault regarding this matter. I\u2019m the one who told Sanlang\u2019s wife that I wanted to eat some candied hawthorns to boost my appetite. It didn\u2019t occur to me that the pregnant Miaozhen liked sour foods\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anymore. Even if that\u2019s true, she was still the one who made those harmful candied hawthorns.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyone who had a mind would probably have realised what was going on by now.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He hadn\u2019t convened this trial just to investigate the truth regarding Miaozhen\u2019s miscarriage. Her hidden motive was to take this opportunity to discipline Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>He Changdi clenched his fists as a glint flashed in his deep eyes.</p><br/><p>The matriarch had been wielding great power and influence within House Jing\u2019an for many years after all. Moreover, Countess Jing\u2019an had been bedridden for so long that she hadn\u2019t managed the household for a long time. Thus, her character was much weaker in comparison. After that retort from her mother-in-law, she couldn\u2019t continue speaking.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t seem to care about Matriarch He\u2019s harsh words. She calmly took a couple steps forward, tilted her head, and said, \u201cGrandmother, even if you\u2019ve already decided that I\u2019m guilty, you should let me have a chance to defend myself at the very least!\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He stared at Chu Lian without saying a word. Her silence meant that she had agreed to give Chu Lian a chance to explain herself.</p><br/><p>He Ying smirked. Her eyes were full of pride for herself. She wanted to see what kind of explanation her nephew\u2019s wife could come up with today.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wasn\u2019t stupid. She wasn\u2019t really going to let others slander her.</p><br/><p>She turned her head towards Countess Jing\u2019an, \u201cMother, do you still have some of the candied hawthorns that I sent you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an quickly nodded in response, \u201cThere is. Miaozhen only ate a few because she wanted a snack. The rest are still here.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that, Countess Jing\u2019an turned around and told her handmaid to retrieve the hawthorns.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

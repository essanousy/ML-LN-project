He would have to go to the imperial court to receive the role through an official ceremony eventually.</p><br/><p>After he and the other accomplished officers from the north had returned to the capital, they had all been granted half a month of leave after their meeting with the Emperor. During this period, He Sanlang planned to spend more quality time with his family.</p><br/><p>The couple continued whispering sweet nothings to each other in the bedroom. Once they had their breakfast, it was time for them to pay their respects to their elders.</p><br/><p>The two first visited Qingxi Hall, before going over to Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s courtyard.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an was leaning slightly skewed against the headboard of a bed with a thick quilt covering her body. She seemed to be in great spirits, perhaps thanks to He Changdi\u2019s safe return from the north and the news of his great accomplishments.</p><br/><p>Her previously thin and pale face had now gained a little more colour, making her seem more lively.</p><br/><p>He Changdi and Chu Lian went to visit Great Doctor Miao together and heard from him that Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s condition was taking a turn for the better. He was preparing to use the Snow Mountain Mists flower in a few more days to make some medicine to permanently cure the root of Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s illness.</p><br/><p>The young couple was seated by Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an held Chu Lian\u2019s hand as she chatted with them.</p><br/><p>In the middle of their conversation, Countess Jing\u2019an said with a smile, \u201cLian\u2019er, I\u2019ve missed your cooking while you were away.\u201d</p><br/><p>A slight smile surfaced on Chu Lian\u2019s face, \u201cWhat would you like to eat, Mother? As long as it\u2019s good for your health, I\u2019ll make it right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she had departed for the north, Chu Lian had regularly sent portions of food to the other courtyards whenever she cooked up something new in Songtao Court. She assumed that Countess Jing\u2019an had become accustomed to her cooking.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an looked to be in serious thought for a moment, \u201cThe candied kumquats I ate the last time were very good, but kumquats are hard to find right now. Would you be able to use hawthorns instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded with a smile, \u201cYes, hawthorns are fine too. I\u2019ll make them myself and send them over to you myself when I\u2019m done, Mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an chatted with the two for some time before letting them leave.</p><br/><p>They left the bedroom and headed out to the parlour, but the moment they had just stepped out of the parlour, Chu Lian\u2019s footsteps came to a halt.</p><br/><p>He Changdi found it strange, so he followed the direction of her gaze and looked towards the corridor on the right.</p><br/><p>They watched as a pregnant woman with a protruding belly walked towards them while being supported by two servants.</p><br/><p>The pregnant woman seemed pretty young. She was wearing a loose apple-red robe with a matching brocade cloak. Her hair was shaped into a simple bun, with just an ordinary golden hairpin holding it up.</p><br/><p>Although her face had become chubbier, Chu Lian was still able to recognise her instantly. She was Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s personal maidservant, Miaozhen.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hadn\u2019t expected Miaozhen\u2019s belly to have grown so quickly in the few months that she had been away/</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian thought of her eldest brother-in-law He Changqi, she felt sorry for him.</p><br/><p>He Changdi and Chu Lian were standing in a rather secluded area. They were basically in a blindspot from where Miaozhen was right now.</p><br/><p>Just as Chu Lian and He Changdi were about to leave, they heard conversation coming from Miaozhen\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>One of the maidservants supporting Miaozhen asked, \u201cSister Miaozhen, are you feeling any discomfort today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miaozhen smiled and replied, \u201cNot at all, I\u2019m feeling good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant then asked, \u201cSister Miaozhen, are you still craving sour foods?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Miaozhen didn\u2019t reply and shyly nodded instead.</p><br/><p>The servant gave a wide smile, \u201cSister Miaozhen, my mother said that craving for sour food means that it\u2019s a boy and craving for spicy food means that it\u2019s a girl! The child in your belly is definitely a little young master!\u201d The servant then paused for a moment as if she was afraid that someone might be eavesdropping. She intentionally moved closer to Miaozhen\u2019s ear and lowered her voice, \u201cOur house doesn\u2019t have a little young master yet, if Sister Miaozhen gives birth to a boy, your position will be stable!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had kept her voice quiet, but Chu Lian was still able to hear every word she said.</p><br/><p>The brows on Chu Lian\u2019s little face furrowed together.</p><br/><p>Happiness was written all over Miaozhen\u2019s face at the thought, while the servant supporting her giggled out loud.</p><br/><p>While Chu Lian was staring blankly at them, He Changdi grabbed her hand. It was still cold in February, so this sent warmth to her icy cold hand.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s handsome face reverted back to the grim expression that he put on in front of others. He then stooped over and whispered into Chu Lian\u2019s ear, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stopped looking in Miaozhen\u2019s direction and gave a slight nod in response. After getting her agreement, He Changdi quickly pulled her away.</p><br/><p>Wenlan and the other servants tactfully kept a distance while still following behind their masters.</p><br/><p>It was only when Chu Lian and He Changdi had finally left the parlour that Miaozhen noticed their presence.</p><br/><p>She immediately stopped in her tracks, subconsciously attempting to greet Third Young Master and Madam, but it was impossible for her to catch up with them considering the speed at which He Sanlang was dragging Chu Lian away.</p><br/><p>The servants by Miaozhen\u2019s sides stared after the tall figure of He Changdi with dazed looks, \u201cSister Miaozhen, is that Third Young Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miaozhen nodded. Her brows knitted together, but she didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>She looked away and continued heading towards Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

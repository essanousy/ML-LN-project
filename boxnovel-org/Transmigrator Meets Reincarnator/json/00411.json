He stared at Mo Chenggui unhappily with a threatening aura that demanded obedience. \u201cUncle Mo, you had better remember this. Nothing happened to Lian\u2019er at all. If I happen to hear anything that says otherwise, I won\u2019t let you off easy even if you\u2019ve served our family for so long!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was shocked by the sudden forceful air his Third Young Master had taken. That aura had been exactly like that of the old count when he had still been alive. Like a bucket of cold water, it had completely woken him up.</p><br/><p>In the end, Mo Chenggui glanced at He Sanlang and chose to seal his lips on this matter. \u201cPlease rest assured, Third Young Master. This old Mo knows how to behave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that Uncle Mo knows how to behave. I hope that Uncle Mo will pass down this order to the rest of the old soldiers. I don\u2019t want to hear any other misunderstandings about Lian\u2019er in the future either.\u201d</p><br/><p>After throwing down those words, He Changdi twitched the reins in his hands and pushed his horse ahead to the warm pen where Chu Lian was.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui stopped his mount and stared at He Changdi\u2019s leaving back as he moved to meet his wife. Uncertainty wavered in his heart. Ever since he had come to the northern border and seen everything that He Changdi had done in the military for himself, his turbid old eyes had a new shine to them.</p><br/><p>The current Count Jing\u2019an, also known as the North Defender General of the border at Mingzhou, was a large, tan and burly man who simply didn\u2019t look at all like the tall and slim Old Count Jing\u2019an.</p><br/><p>If not for how loving the old count and countess had been and how he had watched Matriarch He swelling up for ten months and eventually giving birth to Count Jing\u2019an, he would even have suspected that the current Count Jing\u2019an wasn\u2019t the old count\u2019s biological son.</p><br/><p>Everyone said that He Sanlang took after his mother, Countess Jing\u2019an, but that was because they had never seen Old Count Jing\u2019an in person. Out of the three sons that Madam Liu had given birth to, He Sanlang was the most similar to the old count when he had been young. This was most evident in his slender build and his steady and introverted nature.</p><br/><p>It was most likely because of the similarity to her husband that the matriarch liked this grandson of hers the most.</p><br/><p>The second son of House Jing\u2019an was already twenty four this year. Even though he still refused to take a wife, the matriarch had left him to his own devices. However, when He Sanlang came of age, the matriarch had gone to plead the empress dowager for the sake of getting him one of House Ying\u2019s fertile young misses.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t purely because Matriarch He wanted the He bloodline to go on, but also because she wanted the grandson who looked the most like her husband to leave behind some children of his blood for the future.</p><br/><p>A resolute glint lit up in Mo Chenggui\u2019s old eyes. He seemed to have returned to the days when he had followed the old count to the battlefields and lost themselves in the heat of battle. Since the old count had already gone ahead without him, he would have to take the place of the old count to take care of the grandson who looked the most like him.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the He Estate, He Sanlang actually personally helped Chu Lian out of the warm pen.</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan were waiting on Chu Lian nearby. When they saw this, they couldn\u2019t contain the elation on their faces. It seemed like this incident hadn\u2019t created a gap between Third Young Master and Third Young Madam, but had actually pulled the young couple closer instead.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shot a look at the huge palm that He Sanlang had offered to her and placed her tiny hand in. The corners of her lips curled up.</p><br/><p>Just as the couple had entered the He Estate and settled down at the table, before they even had the time to breathe, Mo Chenggui had already strode in with someone behind him. It was a familiar face to all of them: Laiyue.</p><br/><p>This was when Chu Lian recalled that He Changdi had entrusted the matter of searching for the Snow Mountain Mists flower to Laiyue. Did this mean that there was good news?</p><br/><p>As the thought crossed her mind, she became even more alert.</p><br/><p>When Laiyue entered the hall after Mo Chenggui, his face was practically radiating joy. Even before He Changdi or Chu Lian could ask, he had already spoken up, unable to contain himself. \u201cThird Young Master, Third Young Madam, we found it! We found the Snow Mountain Mists!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected. Chu Lian\u2019s almond-shaped eyes lit up, \u201cDid you find it at Mount Ah-ming? Have you heard when it will bloom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue nodded so furiously that he looked like a chicken pecking at grain. \u201cWe\u2019ve investigated all the details. It seems like the Snow Mountain Mists will bloom in about seven or eight days. We heard from an old barbarian living at the foot of Mount Ah-ming that the flower blooms for about five days. We just have to climb up to the mountain peak during this period and pluck the flower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although there wasn\u2019t any change in He Changdi\u2019s expression, his eyes were also overflowing with the light of expectation. \u201cSince that\u2019s so, send out the orders. Prepare to leave immediately, we\u2019ll depart for the mountain tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui had received the good news along with them, so he followed Laiyue and went off to prepare for the journey.</p><br/><p>Soon, only the young couple were left in the hall, along with Wenqing and Wenlan.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian abruptly turned to He Changdi with her eyes sparkling. She was about to speak when He Changdi cut in first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was stunned speechless, but she had enough wit left to roll her eyes. What was this? When had He Sanlang learned how to read her mind? She hadn\u2019t even said anything yet, but he had already anticipated what she was going to say.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s gaze fell onto her ankle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wound on my ankle healed a long time ago. I can walk the same as any other person now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang remained resolute, \u201cEven so, you\u2019re not allowed to go. Be good and stay in the He Estate. I\u2019ll lead my men to Mount Ah-ming.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, no matter how Chu Lian tried to persuade him, He Sanlang was stubborn and refused to let her go. Even though Chu Lian was on the verge of getting angry at him, He Sanlang still remained steadfast.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had no choice but to give up on following along.</p><br/><p>Actually, she knew that He Sanlang was worried for her health. However, when she saw him being so stubborn, she just wanted to knock heads with him anyway.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

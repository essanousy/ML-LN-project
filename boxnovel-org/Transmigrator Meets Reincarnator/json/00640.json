At this moment, she was seated right beside Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia.</p><br/><p>The one in the highest seat was Imperial Concubine Wei, which was to be expected, then there were the various wives of the princes and imperial ladies.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be quite a number of people here, and the three viewing shelters were all completely filled.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia tossed a walnut that Jinxiu had already opened into her mouth, and rolled her eyes in the direction of Feudal Princess Anmin.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei noticed her action and glared at her, \u201cDuanjia, don\u2019t be rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was seated by Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s side, so she turned to look towards Feudal Princess Duanjia after hearing Princess Wei\u2019s comment.</p><br/><p>At this time, Feudal Princess Duanjia and the other princesses were deeply engrossed in conversation.</p><br/><p>Royal Princesses, Feudal Princesses, Honoured Ladies, and other titled ladies who were related to the imperial family didn\u2019t possess any territory in the Great Wu Dynasty. It wasn\u2019t like in the Tang Dynasty where ladies could be granted territory. It was possible for small amounts of land to be granted, but the disparity in treatment between men and women was like that of heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Even the closest female members to the emperor didn\u2019t hold much power.</p><br/><p>Feudal Princess Anmin\u2019s mother, Princess Ande, was one such person.</p><br/><p>Princess Ande was the eighth daughter of the previous emperor. Her mother had been of lowly birth, and was a palace maid who had been taken by the previous emperor when he had gotten drunk once. After a difficult birth with Princess Ande, she had soon passed away.</p><br/><p>Rumours in the palace spread that Princess Ande was an unlucky star to her mother, so there was no concubine who was willing to foster her.</p><br/><p>She spent her younger years amongst the palace maids, and sometimes, she hadn\u2019t even gotten to eat her fill. Later on, when the current emperor had taken the throne, Princess Ande was finally bestowed a title.</p><br/><p>However, due to the time that she had languished in the palace, the peak of Princess Ande\u2019s life had already passed before she got married. She only managed to give birth to a daughter, Feudal Princess Anmin, when she was almost thirty. Since Princess Ande didn\u2019t hold enough power, her prince consort had taken in two more concubines, and they had each given birth to an illegitimate son.</p><br/><p>Due to the existence of the illegitimate sons, Feudal Princess Anmin didn\u2019t have a harmonious family.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian moved her gaze away, and softly asked Royal Princess Duanjia, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia snorted, \u201cI just don\u2019t like her face. Chu Liu, remember to stay away from people like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian recalled the the events stated in the book. Feudal Princess Anmin had merely been mentioned in a couple of lines, and there weren\u2019t any more details regarding her.</p><br/><p>Before Royal Princess Duanjia could explain to Chu Lian why she didn\u2019t like Feudal Princess Anmin, they were disturbed by the loud noises coming from Feudal Princess Anmin\u2019s table.</p><br/><p>The noises were then followed up with laughter from the young ladies.</p><br/><p>Everyone could hear a delicate and tender voice giggling, \u201cImperial Concubine Wei, don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s really boring for us to just sit here? His Majesty and the others will only return from their hunt later at night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one speaking is Royal Princess Nanzhang,\u201d Royal Princess Duanjia whispered into Chu Lian\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Nanzhang was Prince Lewen\u2019s youngest daughter. Although she was of royal blood, her status was very average. Prince Lewen was the second son of the previous emperor\u2019s brother, Prince Zhao.</p><br/><p>In actuality, when it came to Royal Princess Nanzhang\u2019s generation, she was already considered a distant relative.</p><br/><p>However, Royal Princess Nanzhang was a talented speaker. She would often appear at upper-class gatherings, and she left a deep impression on many noble ladies in the capital. Even Imperial Concubine Wei liked her glib tongue.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Nanzhang had earned her royal title from the power of her speaking alone, so from that angle, she was truly talented.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Nanzhang\u2019s identity was similar to that of a mere socialite, and she wasn\u2019t even worth mentioning in the eyes of those who held real power.</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei, who sat on the upper seat, gave off an elegant smile, \u201cYou silly girl, it\u2019s only been a short while and you\u2019re already bored? Well then, do you have any bright ideas? Come and tell me about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re truly wise, Your Grace! You\u2019ve managed to see through me so easily. Since you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll voice my bold suggestion,\u201d As she spoke, Royal Princess Nanzhang swept her phoenix eyes around the shelter. She had a smile on her face, which made her seem amiable and approachable to others.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we are of the fairer sex, it\u2019s not like we actually lack any strength. We may not be as strong as General Sima, but I believe that practically everyone here can ride a horse! How about we play a game of polo?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Great Wu Dynasty, both football and polo were extremely popular.</p><br/><p>As horses were expensive, football became more popular to the masses than polo. Sometimes, young children could be seen playing football on the streets.</p><br/><p>Polo, on the other hand, was an activity solely for the rich and noble.</p><br/><p>Practically all noble ladies knew how to play it.</p><br/><p>Women\u2019s polo was a little more gentle than men\u2019s polo, and the sticks and balls that they used were different. They also played with fewer players than men, and they played using the most carefully selected tame mares.</p><br/><p>Generally, there was no danger involved at all.</p><br/><p>This game was also an activity whereby ladies could showcase their physical talents.</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei seemed to be swayed by Royal Princess Nanzhang\u2019s words. She smiled and said, \u201cNanzhang has made a good suggestion. Since we\u2019re already out, we might as well have some fun. Everybody came here in riding attire, so it would be a waste for us ladies if we don\u2019t make use of this opportunity to play.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

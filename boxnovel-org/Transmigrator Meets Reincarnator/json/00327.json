She could only follow Captain Guo to the campgrounds of the Right Wing Army and see exactly what kind of environment He Sanlang lived in.</p><br/><p>More than half of the Right Wing Army had gone to the frontlines to act as reinforcements, so there were only little more than half of the men left here. Most of the men remaining had gone to the training grounds, so there were even fewer people milling about. However, it was more convenient for Chu Lian that way.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo did have some business at hand and he was the only officer left in the Right Wing Army now, so he had to do everything himself. Once their party reached the camp grounds, a soldier rushed over to report that one of the squad leaders had twisted his leg on the training grounds, and had even started fighting with another squad leader from the Left Wing Army.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo\u2019s expression turned icy.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian noticed that Captain Guo seemed put on the spot, she said, \u201cBrother Guo, if you have something urgent to settle, please feel free to go ahead. I just need someone else to bring me around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo hesitated for two seconds, but there was nothing else he could do. \u201cThen please sit in Zixiang\u2019s tent for a while, Sister-in-Law. Once I\u2019ve settled my business, I\u2019ll come back immediately and accompany Sister-in-Law for the midday meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo instructed his adjutant to lead Chu Lian over to He Sanlang\u2019s tent before he left with the soldier who had given the report.</p><br/><p>Wenqing watched as Captain Guo\u2019s back disappeared into the distance. For some reason, she felt that the chain of events had been too much of a coincidence.</p><br/><p>However, she couldn\u2019t say anything with strangers present. Wenqing could only helplessly worry and keep an eye on her carefree master.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo\u2019s adjutant was a slightly short and plump young man with a squarish face. When he smiled, his eyes would pinch up and become two tiny, upturned smiles of their own. He looked like someone who was very easy to get along with.</p><br/><p>This adjutant took the lead and pointed at the right side of the camp. \u201cHonoured Lady, please follow this subordinate this way. Captain He\u2019s tent is in the second to last row.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded and allowed Wenlan to support her as they walked. Her leg hadn\u2019t recovered completely yet, so she was a little slow while walking. The adjutant specially slowed down to accommodate her.</p><br/><p>Little flakes of snow were drifting in the sky, so Wenlan put a warm hat on Chu Lian\u2019s head. He Sanlang\u2019s tent wasn\u2019t too far, but due to Chu Lian\u2019s snail-like pace, they used more than twice the normal amount of time it might take.</p><br/><p>Once they reached the tent that the adjutant had mentioned, it didn\u2019t look too different from any of the other tents around- except for the two female soldiers standing in front of the tent!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian paused in her steps and her almond-shaped eyes narrowed. The hands she had stuffed into her rabbit fur sleeve clenched unconsciously.</p><br/><p>The adjutant\u2019s eyes widened in shock. He rubbed the back of his head as he tried to think of an explanation.</p><br/><p>In the entire army, no one but General Sima had command of the female soldiers. So, why were General Sima\u2019s female soldiers standing in front of Captain He\u2019s tent?</p><br/><p>In front of the tent, there was a wooden basin filled with water and a few shirts. It clearly announced for all to see what the female soldiers were doing for He Changdi.</p><br/><p>As for who could have given orders to the prideful female soldiers\u2026 there was only one possible culprit\u2026</p><br/><p>When had that He Sanlang gotten such good treatment?</p><br/><p>The adjutant was a little jealous. However, when he turned to look at the pretty little Honoured Lady Jinyi next to him, his expression changed. As he thought of the terrible situation that the poor He Sanlang was about to be embroiled in, he felt that he would rather be an old bachelor who washed his own clothes by himself\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

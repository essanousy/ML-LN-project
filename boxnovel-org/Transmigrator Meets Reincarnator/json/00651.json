Although his handsome face was as cold as ever, but it was also very pale and haggard.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin lifted the tent flap and saw his good friend was sitting beside the table in a daze.</p><br/><p>He glanced at him calmly with his blue eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why do you look so lifeless?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s thin lips were tightly pursed and his eyes were lowered, as if he was a statue that couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin took off his cloak and handed it to the attendant beside him. After that, he walked towards He Changdi and carefully examined him from head to toe a couple of times.</p><br/><p>His clothes were disheveled. He appeared haggard and miserable. He had an unkempt beard and bloodshot eyes with dark shadows under them. Tsk\u2026 What in the world had happened to this guy?</p><br/><p>As soon as Prince Jin sat down, a maidservant brought over a warming soup.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t even lifted his spoon when He Changdi gloomily said, \u201cGive me a bowl, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin was stunned now. He held the spoon and looked at his close friend with furrowed brows, \u201cWith the meals that Jinyi cooks, you still want the food prepared here?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Guilin Restaurant had still been open, he would go to the restaurant to satisfy his cravings. Even a dignified prince had to visit a restaurant in order to satisfy his appetite. On the other hand, He Changdi was actually going around outside to eat other people\u2019s \u2018crudely made\u2019 food. What a joke.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was indifferent to Prince Jin\u2019s teasing and said faintly, \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten anything for a whole day and night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWould Jinyi starve you?\u201d That girl was a foodie. She was probably stuffing her face whenever she was free. There was no way she didn\u2019t prepare any food. Even if she didn\u2019t make it herself, she still had two maidservants, who had learned some of her skills, beside her!</p><br/><p>No matter what, He Changdi wouldn\u2019t be starved.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang didn\u2019t say anything and remained silent. When the maidservant brought another bowl of soup over, he held it up and finished it in one breath.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t tasting the food at all and was just simply trying to fill his stomach.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin was somewhat dumbfounded and shook his head helplessly, \u201cI wanted you to taste it properly. Although the soup isn\u2019t as delicious as the foods that Jinyi makes, it\u2019s still considered a delicacy.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Prince Jin was drinking his soup, his attendant came in to make a report.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting to Fourth Prince, Honoured Lady Jinyi sent over some wild game. Would you like to try some right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin was stunned and raised his brows. Look at that. The moment he mentioned Chu Lian, she had sent over some food for him to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring them in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant hastily went out. A moment later, he came in with a food box. Then, he took out the two plates of meat from the food box and placed them on the table.</p><br/><p>A plate of venison and a plate of duck meat, which were already sliced up.</p><br/><p>They had just been roasted, so the roast meat inside the plates was still steaming with heat. The fragrance of the meat billowed up into their faces.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin picked up his chopsticks and pointed at the two plates in front of him, \u201cYou\u2019ve been exposed. Can you still say you didn\u2019t eat anything? Jinyi wouldn\u2019t have sent all the roasted meats that she prepared over to me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi had a bitter expression on his face because it was true. Chu Lian hadn\u2019t left any of her cooking for him to eat.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, He Sanlang picked up his chopsticks, grabbed a piece of roasted meat, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p><br/><p>It was crispy and tender, a taste that was unforgettable for a lifetime. It had definitely been roasted with Chu Lian\u2019s recipe.</p><br/><p>However, his mouth was filled with bitterness when eating such delicious delicacies.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin didn\u2019t think his good friend would suddenly start digging into his food.</p><br/><p>He complained, \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you being too rude? Jinyi sent these for me to eat. If you want to eat, then have Jinyi make some for you. You can eat as much as you want. Why are you taking my share?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Prince Jin complained, he didn\u2019t stop his friend\u2019s action. He knew his friend was in a bad mood. He had only interrupted to distract his friend from his thoughts.</p><br/><p>The two plates of roast meats were soon cleared by these two grown men.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin leaned back against his chair slightly. His gaze fell upon his friend, who was still in a daze, \u201cSay it. What happened? Did you have an argument with Jinyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang rubbed his stiff face and took a deep breath, \u201cLian\u2019er is mad at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin lifted his pair of unique eyes, \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang and Prince Jin were sworn brothers who had grown up together. Since their previous lifetime, they had been best friends who could risk their lives for each other. Thus, there was nothing they couldn\u2019t talk about.</p><br/><p>After some deliberation, He Changdi told him the whole story.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin was slightly stunned after listening to him. His blue eyes flickered in disbelief, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t actually be interested in that brat Leyao, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi was dumbfounded by his friend\u2019s question. He had a grim expression on his face and his voice had a sense of anger, \u201cLu Yi, what do you mean?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin sneered coldly, \u201cYou embraced her and you\u2019ve been accompanying her. Doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re interested in that brat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. Imperial Princess Leyao is only eleven years old. I\u2019m not a pervert!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was His Majesty\u2019s order. I can\u2019t reject an imperial order.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin gave his idiotic friend a glare and scoffed, \u201cAre you an idiot? Leyao is already eleven years old. Are there any imperial children who are actually na\u00efve? Don\u2019t tell me that Leyao is still young. In another year, she is going to be twelve. Even for noble families, marriage arrangements can begin when they\u2019re twelve. Leyao is resentful towards Jinyi. Haven\u2019t you ever considered Jinyi\u2019s feelings? In my opinion, you\u2019re probably worse than Xiao Bojian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin\u2019s last comment was somewhat harsh, but when facing someone so oblivious, he had to knock him awake somehow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

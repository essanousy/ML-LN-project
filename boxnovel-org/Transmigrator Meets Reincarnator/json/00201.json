You\u2019re actually keeping someone like that as company!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was pulled back to reality by that young, angry voice. When she focused her gaze on the source, she saw Imperial Princess Leyao standing not too far from them. The two ladies standing behind her were the same ones she had seen last time at the Dingyuan Estate, House Dingyuan\u2019s Fifth Miss, Zou Yuanqin, and Feudal Princess Anmin.</p><br/><p>One of Chu Lian\u2019s eyebrows shot up. She was about to speak, but Royal Princess Duanjia beat her to the punch and started to retort with, \u201cLeyao, when has it been up to you to manage my business? If you\u2019re that free, why don\u2019t you mind your own!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the way to Ninghe Palace, Chu Lian had already told Royal Princess Duanjia about everything that had happened at Tingyu Pavilion, so Duanjia also knew about Princess Leyao\u2019s grounding.</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao was actually a rank higher than Royal Princess Duanjia. However, Prince Wei and the Chengping Emperor were blood brothers, and the Emperor favoured Prince Wei. Since Royal Princess Duanjia was Prince Wei\u2019s only daughter, she held favour with both the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. She wasn\u2019t any less favoured than Imperial Princess Leyao.</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao had always maintained a cordial relationship with her cousin, the equally pampered Royal Princess Duanjia. However, who could have expected Royal Princess Duanjia to side with Chu Lian?</p><br/><p>Leyao\u2019s face had instantly turned white from rage. She couldn\u2019t win over Royal Princess Duanjia, but was she really going to lose to a measly Honoured Lady like Chu Lian?</p><br/><p>What was strange was that Imperial Princess Leyao didn\u2019t say anything in retaliation to Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s retort. Instead, she actually managed to hold back her anger, and only led her entourage away. At the same time, she shot a fierce glare at Chu Lian and smirked.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s brows drew together. That smirk gave her an uncomfortable feeling.</p><br/><p>When Royal Princess Duanjia saw that Chu Lian didn\u2019t seem too happy, she tried to reassure her in her own clumsy way. \u201cChu Liu, you don\u2019t have to care about that sort of person. She\u2019s just throwing a tantrum because she\u2019s used to being spoiled. Who knows when she\u2019ll be able to grow some brains!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian managed to pull out a smile for the princess, but her right eyelid kept twitching for some mysterious reason.</p><br/><p>After about ten minutes, Matriarch He\u2019s handmaid, Muxiang, came rushing over from somewhere. Her face was extremely troubled. When she saw Chu Lian, it was as if she had seen salvation.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked over, but before she could ask what had happened, Muxiang had already spoken first. \u201cThird Young Madam, something bad happened! The matriarch requires your presence!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s brows were raised high. She had a hunch that this had something to do with Imperial Princess Leyao.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Chu Lian was going to leave in a hurry, Royal Princess Duanjia frowned and asked, \u201cChu Liu, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian suppressed her anxiety and said, \u201cRoyal Princess, my grandmother is looking for me. I have to go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to come along with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia didn\u2019t press the matter. After watching Chu Lian leave with that handmaid, she moved to another wing of the side hall.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei seemed to have noticed the commotion. She sent someone to look for Royal Princess Duanjia, who then personally went to meet Princess Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like something has happened to House Jing\u2019an. Chu Liu was called over by Matriarch He.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Wei gripped one of her handkerchiefs and thought for a moment. Then, to one of her senior servants, she instructed, \u201cSend someone to take a look. If there\u2019s really something that can\u2019t be resolved, report back to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was taken to another wing of the side hall by Muxiang. She went further in as Muxiang turned back around to shut the doors tight. As expected, there was Matriarch He, sitting by the table with Madam Zou standing next to her respectfully.</p><br/><p>Muxiang led Chu Lian over to Matriarch He, only to see Matriarch He slam her cane on the ground and shout, \u201cDalang\u2019s wife! What is going on here? How could you have lost our round cakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou lowered her head, face pale as she replied to the matriarch with a trembling voice. \u201cGrandmother, when Granddaughter-in-Law left the estate, Granddaughter-in-Law checked through everything personally. When Granddaughter-in-Law entered the palace, our round cakes were still there. They only disappeared once Granddaughter-in-Law entered Ninghe Palace\u2026 Granddaughter-in-Law\u2026 really doesn\u2019t know where they went\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He banged her cane on the floor again, restraining the urge to hit Madam Zou with it instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cDalang\u2019s wife, tell me! When you entered the palace, who was holding onto that box of round cakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the palace was hosting a Mid-Autumn Banquet today, the noble madams of each estate were not allowed to bring just anyone with them. Someone of Madam Zou\u2019s rank was only allowed to bring in two servants at most.</p><br/><p>She had brought her most trusted senior servant and handmaid, Senior Servant Qiao and Jinshui.</p><br/><p>This whole matter was extremely suspicious, so Madam Zou didn\u2019t dare to hide anything. However, she also wanted to protect her own servants. After mumbling for a bit, she didn\u2019t say anything concrete. Chu Lian was starting to frown as she watched on from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam Zou! Look at what has happened! Are you not going to answer me? Are you trying to bring down our entire family?!\u201d Matriarch He was usually amiable, and she rarely lost her temper like this. Years of accumulated stress poured out all at once, even scaring Chu Lian, let alone the guilty Madam Zou.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, please calm down! Granddaughter-in-Law will say it! It was\u2026 It was Granddaughter-in-Law\u2019s Jinshui\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Madam Zou had given a name, Senior Servant Zhou, who served Matriarch He, immediately shouted, \u201cWhat a daring servant! Even after committing a crime, you\u2019re still refusing to admit to it? Kneel down at once!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jinshui was already afraid since she had lost the estate\u2019s round cakes. Now that she was being shouted at by Senior Servant Zhou, her legs turned to jelly and she collapsed on the ground. She tried and failed to support herself with her trembling arms a few times before she finally managed to crawl over to Matriarch He.</p><br/><p>\u201cMatriarch, Matriarch, please have mercy on this servant! This servant\u2026 this servant didn\u2019t lose the box on purpose. This servant was carefeully holding onto the box while following Eldest Young Madam into Ninghe Palace. When this servant was turning a corner, a eunuch suddenly pushed this servant. This servant smelled something strange and immediately fainted. When this servant came to, the box was gone! That eunuch had also disappeared. Matriarch, this servant\u2026 has been caught in someone else\u2019s schemes!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

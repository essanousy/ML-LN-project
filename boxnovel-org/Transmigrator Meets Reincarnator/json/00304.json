It was getting late; if they didn\u2019t move quickly, it would be dark by the time they left the forest. There were too many unknowns in the dark, and there had already been one ambush. They couldn\u2019t give the Tuhuns another chance to attack them.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, He Changdi held a post in the army. This time, he had come out against the wishes of Captain Guo. It had already been two days, so they couldn\u2019t delay their return any longer. Even so, when He Sanlang returned to the camp, he would likely have to suffer some punishment.</p><br/><p>The men rode their horses hard and none of them had the mood to talk at this time. Chu Lian gripped the saddle of the galloping horse under her tightly as the cold winter winds brushed against her cheeks like knives. Her shaking body had been stabilised at some point by a strong arm wrapped around her waist. As furious as she was with her husband, it would be silly of her to struggle at this time and place.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that strong arm holding her steady, Chu Lian\u2019s back was pressed against He Sanlang\u2019s chest. Even through that cold and hard armour, she could still hear the fast, powerful beat of his heart.</p><br/><p>She pressed her lips together as a warm flush overtook her face.</p><br/><p>She covered her face with her hands and told herself that the only reason her face was so hot was because of the chaffing cold winds.</p><br/><p>When dusk fell, the party finally reached a small town close to Liangzhou City.</p><br/><p>The maidservants and retainers who had accompanied Chu Lian here, along with the two guards that Princess Wei had sent, were resting in a residence here and recovering from their injuries.</p><br/><p>Zhao Liang dismounted first and went off to report their arrival. The entrance of their courtyard was immediately flung open from the inside as Wenqing and Wenlan came out to welcome her.</p><br/><p>He Changdi carried Chu Lian off the horse, but didn\u2019t let her down. He carried her straight into the courtyard under the watch of Wenqing and Wenlan. The two maidservants followed after with pale and panicked faces. Manager Qin\u2019s face was also full of worry. He looked towards the men who had escorted He Changdi and Chu Lian back. Since he had clearly seen how Mo Chenggui had treated his Third Young Madam, his gaze skipped over the old soldier and landed on Zhao Liang and Xiao Hongyu instead.</p><br/><p>He quickly walked over to ask, \u201cExcuse me, sirs. What happened to our Third Young Madam? Has she been injured anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu saw that he was truly worried, so he reported what he had been told. \u201cI heard Brother He say that she injured her foot. Don\u2019t worry, Sister-in-Law\u2019s injury isn\u2019t too bad. She should be fine after a few days of rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard Xiao Hongyu\u2019s reply, Manager Qin heaved a sigh of relief. He thought carefully about their current situation. Half of Third Young Madam\u2019s party was injured, so they probably wouldn\u2019t be able to continue their journey immediately. They would likely have to stay in this small town for a few days.</p><br/><p>\u201cSirs, please come in and rest. I\u2019ve already ordered the servants to cook a meal for our guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu and Zhao Liang were indeed hungry. However, when they thought of the military order hanging over their heads, they waved their hands in rejection. \u201cKind sir, there\u2019s no need for that. Once Brother He comes out, we have to hurry back to camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin almost gaped in shock. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re still rushing back to camp?\u201d He looked up at the darkening sky. \u201cBut it\u2019s almost night.\u201d It was already dangerous enough to rush on the roads in winter. This area was close to the northern border, so the risk was even higher.</p><br/><p>Zhao Liang smiled bitterly. \u201cThanks for your kind offer, sir, but we have to follow our orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how resolute they were, Manager Qin couldn\u2019t hold them back. However, he couldn\u2019t let their guests continue standing outside either. These men were clearly Third Young Master\u2019s comrades and subordinates. He had to treat them well.</p><br/><p>Thus, he invited the men into the courtyard to sit for a while and ordered the servants to bring in hot water. He also prepared some food and wrapped it up for the soldiers to bring along.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin was very smooth and capable. He did all of the above under Chu Lian\u2019s name, so that He Sanlang\u2019s comrades would have a good impression of their brave sister-in-law who had come all the way to the northern border.</p><br/><p>In the main room of the small courtyard, He Sanlang set Chu Lian down on the bed and turned to leave with a cold expression. Wenqing and Wenlan came over anxiously to ask about Chu Lian\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t have the mood to answer the two girls. Instead, she turned towards He Changdi\u2019s departing back and quickly called, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi hadn\u2019t expected Chu Lian to call out for him. He froze and stopped walking.</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan could see that their masters had something to say to each other. Wenqing shot a look at Wenlan and the two girls quietly stood up, bobbed towards Chu Lian, and retreated. They even closed the room\u2019s door for the couple.</p><br/><p>He Changdi shifted sideways so he could look back and see Chu Lian\u2019s small figure sitting on the bed.</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt that his throat was as dry as a desert; he couldn\u2019t say anything at all and could only cough and use the sound to cover up his guilt and awkwardness.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian clenched the hem of her clothes in her hands and seemed to be having trouble speaking as well. However, it hadn\u2019t been easy for them to meet again, and they were married after all. If they left this misunderstanding as it was, it wouldn\u2019t be good for them. She could also feel that He Sanlang\u2019s attitude towards her had improved significantly since their wedding day.</p><br/><p>With that thought, she gathered up her courage and blurted out in one go, \u201cHe Sanlang, I\u2026 I\u2019m in the wrong for not recognising you. I\u2019m apologising to you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s eyes that had always been unreadable since his reincarnation began to ripple with emotion. Those beautiful ripples expanded and grew until they reached his heart.</p><br/><p>TL Note: Announcing a change of names!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuhong -&gt; Xiao Hongyu</p><br/><p>All previous chapters have been updated and this character will be referred to with Xiao Hongyu from now!

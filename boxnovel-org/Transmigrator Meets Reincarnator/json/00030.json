He Sanlang pushed Chu Lian away with enough force to make the sleeping Chu Lian almost fall onto the carpet of the carriage.</p><br/><p>This time, Chu Lian jolted awake. She looked around in confusion before realising that she was still in the carriage.</p><br/><p>There was some suspicious wetness at the corner of her mouth\u2026 Chu Lian blushed deeply before taking out a handkerchief and quickly wiping it off.</p><br/><p>Next, she noticed that He Changdi was looking at her with anger, and maybe even the slight hint of a grudge. She faintly recalled that she had been sleeping on He Changdi\u2019s thigh, and she had been drooling. Her eyes couldn\u2019t resist drifting in the direction of He Changdi\u2019s thigh.</p><br/><p>It was close to summer now, and the weather was turning warm, so they were all wearing cool spring clothes.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was wearing a thin, light-blue robe with embroidered flowers. It looked both low key and luxurious, matching his calm, aloof aura perfectly.</p><br/><p>From afar, he looked like a mountain flower that no one could profane.</p><br/><p>However, on that completely unwrinkled silk brocade robe of his, there was a wet patch about half the size of a palm near the crotch area\u2026 The position was a little\u2026 awkward, and it would be extremely easy for others to misunderstand.</p><br/><p>If it had been a dark coloured robe, it wouldn\u2019t have been too obvious, but the wet patch stood stark against the light coloured robe.</p><br/><p>It only took one glance for Chu Lian to realise she had caused some trouble this time!</p><br/><p>The corner of her eye twitched. She hurriedly hid in the corner like an ostrich, moving as far away from He Changdi as she could and pretending she hadn\u2019t seen anything.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s expression had turned completely black. He had the sudden urge to beat Chu Lian up, but he had never hit a woman before; it was part of the He Family principles to never harm a lady.</p><br/><p>He snatched the handkerchief in Chu Lian\u2019s hands away and scrubbed at the \u2018suspicious\u2019 mark on his robe. However, he didn\u2019t realise that Chu Lian had already used the handkerchief to wipe her mouth, so he ended up making the wet patch even bigger\u2026</p><br/><p>He Changdi threw the handkerchief to the floor. This time, his face was so black, it could probably drip ink.</p><br/><p>He was about to ridicule Chu Lian when he heard Laiyue announce from outside the carriage, \u201cThird Young Master, Third Young Madam, we\u2019ve reached the entrance of the estate. Senior Servant Liu and Eldest Young Madam are waiting to welcome us at the entrance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, the carriage came to a stop.</p><br/><p>Since Eldest Sister-in-Law had personally come out to welcome the couple back home, it would be rude if they didn\u2019t get out of the carriage to meet her. He Changdi\u2019s hopes of ordering Laiyue to drive the carriage all the way back to their courtyard were dashed.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the carriage was tense and strange. Chu Lian couldn\u2019t withstand the deathly look that He Sanlang was sending her, so she pushed aside the curtains of the carriage and alighted.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou was already waiting by the side of the carriage. Matriarch He had been worried that He Sanlang might have drunk too much at the Ying Estate, so she had sent her eldest granddaughter-in-law and Senior Servant Liu out to receive them.</p><br/><p>When Madam Zou saw Xiyan helping Chu Lian out of the carriage, she was stunned for a moment.</p><br/><p>Following that, a blush spread on her face. Senior Servant Liu coughed twice, a smile shining in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know why they seemed to be trying but failing to hold back their smiles upon seeing her.</p><br/><p>The attentive Xiyan had also flushed red. She hurriedly tidied up Chu Lian\u2019s clothes and adjusted the accessories on her head.</p><br/><p>By this time, He Sanlang had finally alighted from the carriage after dawdling as much as he could. After noticing Chu Lian\u2019s disorderly appearance, Madam Zou and Senior Servant Liu couldn\u2019t help but glance at He Sanlang.</p><br/><p>When they saw the wet patch on He Sanlang\u2019s clothes, Madam Zou almost choked on air while Senior Servant Liu\u2019s eyes merely crinkled upwards. She was already an old woman, there was nothing she hadn\u2019t seen before. She reacted quickly and walked to He Sanlang\u2019s side to help block the onlookers\u2019 gazes.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s hands were trembling with the force of his rage. He wanted to strangle Chu Lian on the spot. It was all that wicked woman\u2019s fault! He had been completely embarrassed in front of his seniors!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

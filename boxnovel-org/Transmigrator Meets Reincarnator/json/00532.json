She pouted and cursed him under her breath.</p><br/><p>When she was done sorting out her appearance, she returned to the study to do some work.</p><br/><p>Once Chu Lian had left and He Sanlang couldn\u2019t hear any more sounds coming from the bedroom, he was finally able to move freely without the fear of being heard.</p><br/><p>Some time later, a small piece of fabric fell out of He Sanlang\u2019s hand, which had been draped over the edge of the bathtub. If Chu Lian had been there to see the soft light-coloured piece of fabric, she would have immediately identified it as her breast band\u2026</p><br/><p>He Changdi took a deep sigh and leaned back against the wall of the bathtub, basking in the afterglow while calming down.</p><br/><p>He smiled bitterly, feeling as if his actions were like shooting himself in the foot.</p><br/><p>When he got out of the bathtub, He Changdi picked up the small piece of fabric and put it together with his dirty clothes. He rubbed his nose a little awkwardly, before putting on clean clothes and leaving the bathroom.</p><br/><p>He Changdi and Chu Lian had lunch together at noon.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had the habit of taking afternoon naps, so she went to sleep an hour after lunch.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was tempted to take a nap with his wife, but when he recalled what had happened in the study, he gritted his teeth and went to his study to work.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t be bothered with him. She had been craving sleep more for the past two days, perhaps due to the nourishing soup that Senior Servant Zhong had given her. It might also have been due to the arrival of spring, and she was having trouble adjusting to the changing seasons.</p><br/><p>In any case, Chu Lian fell asleep soon after getting into bed.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui lifted the drapes to take a peek, before stealthily leaving the room.</p><br/><p>Happiness was shining from Senior Servant Gui\u2019s eyes. She bumped into Xiyan at the side room and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThird Young Madam has suddenly been sleeping so much, could it be\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xiyan was a young maiden herself, she had been educated about various things by Senior Servants Zhong and Gui for the sake of serving Chu Lian as a handmaid. Therefore, she was aware of many details regarding matters after marriage.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, she smiled and answered, \u201c<i>Momo</i>, you\u2019re overthinking things! How could anything happen this quickly? Third Young Madam has only just consummated her marriage! Perhaps she\u2019s feeling easily tired now that it\u2019s spring because she overexerted herself at the northern border.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan\u2019s suggestion caused the smile to fade from Senior Servant Gui\u2019s face, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll have to ask Great Doctor Miao to take a look at Third Young Madam tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan smiled; Senior Servant Gui was worrying too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you forgotten? Third Young Master recently asked Great Doctor Miao to take Third Young Madam\u2019s pulse and Third Young Madam has been drinking nourishing soup daily!\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting reminded of the situation, Senior Servant Gui shook her head helplessly .</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t resist adding on, \u201cI really hope Third Young Madam can get pregnant soon, so she can get a foothold in the estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan sighed in response. Didn\u2019t they all!</p><br/><p>The customs in the Great Wu Dynasty were more open than the previous dynasty, so even young ladies who hadn\u2019t come of age could participate in banquets and visit their friends. However, the rules were still more strict on women, especially after marriage. If a wife didn\u2019t manage to produce any heirs, it was as good as committing a crime.</p><br/><p>This could be seen from what had happened to the first branch. If Madam Zou had birthed a son, her relationship with He Dalang would never have deteriorated to its current state.</p><br/><p>It had been at least half a year since Third Young Madam and Third Young Master had gotten married. Although they knew that the two had only consummated their marriage a few days ago, no one else did! If people started gossiping about it, Third Young Madam would be the one who received the blame.</p><br/><p>When a wife couldn\u2019t produce any heirs, the blame was always directed at the woman.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

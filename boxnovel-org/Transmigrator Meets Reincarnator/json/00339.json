His face was still flushed as he pointed at Chu Lian with a trembling hand, \u201cYou\u2026 Chu Lian, you loose woman\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah?</p><br/><p>It was Chu Lian\u2019s turn to open her eyes wide. Just looking at some lewd drawings was enough to condemn her as a loose woman? They were such lousy drawings too.</p><br/><p>A corner of her lips tugged downwards. Or should she say that this lunatic husband of hers was just too inexperienced?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t care about He Sanlang\u2019s reprimand at all. She simply rolled her eyes wordlessly. \u201cIsn\u2019t your book too low quality?\u201d Even with such poor quality, He Sanlang was still hiding it like it was some treasure.</p><br/><p>He Changdi almost exploded on the spot upon hearing that. His frustration was stuck in his chest with nowhere to go. That chattering mouth of hers was really annoying as well. His pupils contracted; he finally lost control of his emotions and grabbed her shoulders before sweeping her up in a fierce kiss.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had just been in the middle of enjoying He Sanlang\u2019s blushing a second ago. In the next instant, her mind went completely blank.</p><br/><p>She could feel the pressure of something soft and slightly cool on her lips. She blinked once, then twice, before she finally came to her senses.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was kissing her by force!</p><br/><p>She immediately put her hands on He Changdi\u2019s chest and instinctively struggled as she tried to push him away.</p><br/><p>However, He Changdi\u2019s palms were so strong that they seemed to be made of steel. They held onto her slender shoulders so that she couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t understand what kind of fit he was having now.</p><br/><p>The fires of He Sanlang\u2019s rage were still burning brightly. If he were to let go of her mouth and let her continue speaking, who knew what new ways she would find to infuriate him? Thus, he simply kept her mouth occupied.</p><br/><p>He still hadn\u2019t realised that his heart was beating tremendously fast while he was kissing Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was still a virgin after all. He didn\u2019t even know how to kiss, let alone act out the scenes shown in that naughty little book. When he realised that Chu Lian was struggling, his only reaction was to press his lips even more forcefully onto hers, as if he could subdue her by doing so. How naive.</p><br/><p>Although the mouth that was always filled with words meant to provoke him was annoying, it tasted rahter good. He wondered what Chu Lian had just eaten. There was an addictively sweet taste on her soft, supple lips that drew him back time and time again for more.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian made muffled sounds of complaint. Their teeth were grinding against each other, so she was feeling very uncomfortable. However, He Sanlang was like a bull locked on his target, he just tried going forward without turning back.</p><br/><p>While wailing in her heart, Chu Lian had no choice but to part her lips slightly so she could catch He Changdi\u2019s upper lip between her own, giving herself a chance to breathe.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang reacted as if he had just been struck by lightning. His body stiffened unconsciously as enlightenment seemed to have dawned upon him from the heavens.</p><br/><p>It was easy for men to grasp what to do in these kinds of situations without any prior experience. Chu Lian\u2019s simple action had somehow opened a gateway in his mind; He Changdi had somehow managed to gain insight into the art of kissing in a mere instant.</p><br/><p>He mounted a counterattack, causing Chu Lian to lose her advantageous position and face a pending defeat.</p><br/><p>By the time He Changdi finally let go of her, Chu Lian\u2019s lips had already turned red and swollen\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was a little annoyed. She covered her lips and glared fiercely at He Sanlang. \u201cHe Changdi! Would it kill you to be gentle?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was He Sanlang\u2019s first time experiencing something so wonderful. He had still been panting for breath while immersed in the recollection of the sweet taste on his lips. Chu Lian\u2019s complaint snapped him back to reality and caused his expression to darken, as if his pride as a man had been questioned.</p><br/><p>However, he did feel a little guilty, since he hadn\u2019t known how to kiss at all at the start. It was only later on that he had discovered the true technique of kissing, so he held back his retort. After struggling for a moment, he finally managed to reply with a subdued, \u201cI\u2019ll be gentler next time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian rolled her eyes.</p><br/><p>She muttered to herself, \u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was just a kiss, it felt like she had almost been completely eaten up by him. That feeling was just too scary.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

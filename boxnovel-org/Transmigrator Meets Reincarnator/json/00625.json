She had already forgotten about the brazen words that He Changdi had said to her earlier in front of the remote palace hall.</p><br/><p>Under these circumstances, she seriously couldn\u2019t remember what she had promised He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian innocently blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s handsome face turned gloomy. He got up and swiftly walked to Chu Lian\u2019s side. Then, he trapped her between himself and the dressing table with his long arms.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang bent down. They were so close, they could practically feel each other\u2019s breaths.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s cheeks unconsciously flushed as she looked into his deep eyes. She felt a mix of embarrassed and annoyed at him.</p><br/><p>She pulled back slightly, putting some distance between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whenever Chu Lian retreated a little, He Changdi would move closer. In the end, Chu Lian\u2019s entire back was up against the dressing table. She was unable to distance herself from He Sanlang, and the atmosphere between them turned suggestive instead.</p><br/><p>The handmaids who were on duty inside the bedroom had already tactfully left the room.</p><br/><p>He Changdi stared at her. When he spoke, she could feel his warm, clear breath on her face. Chu Lian was blushing with shyness when she heard him ask, \u201cDo you remember now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian felt uneasy because it seemed as if he was able to see into the depths of her heart. She subconsciously looked away, not daring to make eye contact with his ink-black eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian feigned ignorance. She really hadn\u2019t remembered the promise she made to He Changdi at the remote palace hall, but now\u2026</p><br/><p>Anyone would be able to guess with a single glance the kind of thoughts her voracious husband was currently having. Thus, she was going with the oblivious route.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid. He Changdi was often insatiable when he wanted her. Chu Lian had been scared off intimacy with him after the last time.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang stared at her evasive gaze, then suddenly smiled with a strange curve to his lips. He lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t understand? Lian\u2019er, I\u2019ll give you one more chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s entire body trembled. The devilish expression that had suddenly appeared on He Changdi\u2019s face made her somewhat edgy, but she was already at the point of no return with her charade. She couldn\u2019t screw up at this critical moment.</p><br/><p>She bit her lips, blinked her watery eyes, and firmly said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know. He Changdi, you must have remembered it wrongly.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next second, her tender earlobe was immediately held within his warm, humid mouth. The sensation of it sent tingles through her whole body.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes widened because of He Changdi\u2019s actions. Her hands reached out in an attempt to push him away and cover her sensitive ears.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was able to pull Chu Lian\u2019s hand away from her eyes by exerting a little force with his slender fingers. He propped himself up with one hand on the dressing table, then used his other hand to capture her two slender wrists. He rained kisses on her tender earlobes and neck before continuing downwards.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was held completely under his control. She didn\u2019t even have the leeway to struggle.</p><br/><p>All she could do was retort with her mouth, \u201cHe Changdi, stop it! I want to take a bath!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? There\u2019s no hurry. I\u2019ll help you recover your memory first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was furious. \u201cHow is this supposed to help recover my memory?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her nagging little mouth was soon attacked.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang lifted Chu Lian\u2019s delicate figure onto the dressing table. It took Chu Lian a few moments before she could even react.</p><br/><p>He leaned against her as his large hand wandered all over her body on a dangerous path. Chu Lian\u2019s entire body felt limp and weak. He bent down beside her ear and asked, \u201cDo you remember now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian seriously wanted to cry. At this point, she didn\u2019t dare to say that she didn\u2019t remember. She looked towards He Changdi with pleading eyes and nodded pitifully.</p><br/><p>He Changdi saw that the little woman in his arms had finally admitted defeat, so he immediately started the battle to satisfy Chu Lian\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t think that he would really go for it, even after she surrendered. She seriously wanted to die right now.</p><br/><p>She resisted the urge to moan and firmly bit onto her red lips. She glared at him with watery eyes and complained with a shaky voice, \u201cI\u2019ve already admitted my fault\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi lowered his head and dropped kisses down her beautiful collarbone with his thin lips. His voice was hoarse yet restrained as he said, \u201cSince you made a mistake, you should be punished!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had already attacked her delicate lips before Chu Lian even got the chance to finish speaking.</p><br/><p>As a result, the young couple didn\u2019t get to the bathroom until an hour later. This also meant that the tub of hot water prepared in the study had become completely unnecessary.</p><br/><p>He Changdi carried the worn-out Chu Lian directly to their bedroom, then straight into the bathroom inside it.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian leaned against He Sanlang\u2019s sturdy chest, sulking with a pout.</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t mind at all; in fact, he felt refreshed. Since he was fully content, there was nothing wrong with yielding to his wife now.</p><br/><p>With one hand wrapped around Chu Lian\u2019s slender waist, his other resting on the edge of the bathtub, He Changdi closed his eyes and laid back to relax.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sulked by herself for a while, but she felt that it was pointless when He Changdi didn\u2019t even react to her pouting. She turned around slightly and used her index finger to jab at He Changdi\u2019s muscular chest. \u201cHe Changdi, I\u2019ve already fulfilled your request. We don\u2019t owe each other anything now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi opened his deep eyes and narrowed them dangerously. He looked at his wife who was lying within his embrace, her face flushed from the hot steam, and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gave him a glare. If she wasn\u2019t being held within He Changdi\u2019s embrace right now, she would have definitely placed her hands on her waist in an imposing manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already fulfilled the promise I made with you! You can\u2019t use that matter to threaten me again!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi glanced at her and smirked. \u201cWho said that was my request? I\u2019ve already told you earlier, that was a punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Sanlang, don\u2019t push your luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2026 He had done it twice just now! Even if the first time was considered a punishment, then the second time should have been enough to fulfill her promise!</p><br/><p>How could he be so shameless?!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s chest was heaving due to anger. He Changdi\u2019s gaze narrowed at the sight of her moving chest, which was partially covered by the flower petals within the tub.</p><br/><p>In the end, the pitiful Honoured Lady Jinyi didn\u2019t get to sleep until late at night in order to fulfill her promise.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

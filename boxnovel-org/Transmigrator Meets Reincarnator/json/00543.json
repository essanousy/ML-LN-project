Although they passed a few servants along the way, the servants were all low-ranked and they didn\u2019t dare to question why Chu Lian had appeared there at that time.</p><br/><p>They reached the side entrance without any obstructions. Wenqing found House Jing\u2019an\u2019s guards and driver and helped Chu Lian up the carriage. Without further ado, they left the Ying Estate.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian was finally sitting safely in the carriage, her heart was still beating rapidly.</p><br/><p>That was too close!</p><br/><p>Wenqing\u2019s expression was still grim as she poured a cup of warm water for Chu Lian, \u201cThird Young Madam, please have a cup of water to calm your nerves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian took the teacup in her hands without bringing it up to her lips, she simply held it in a daze.</p><br/><p>Wenlan was filled with self-reproach, \u201cThird Young Madam, it was this servant\u2019s fault for being so unskilled. This servant couldn\u2019t even beat a maidservant and Third Young Madam was almost in danger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If not for that bag of chilli powder that Chu Lian had thrown, the Wen sisters couldn\u2019t possibly have subdued that purple-clothed maidservant so quickly.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian returned to reality and shook her head, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to blame yourselves. That maidservant was specially trained so it\u2019s normal that you weren\u2019t able to beat her. We left in such a hurry that we didn\u2019t get to inform my husband. Send someone to inform him now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing nodded and left to carry out her orders.</p><br/><p>Back in the Ying Estate.</p><br/><p>The banquet was in full swing in the parlour of the outer court. A senior servant whispered something into Miss Yuan\u2019s ear over at the female guests\u2019 side of the party.</p><br/><p>A satisfied glint flashed through Miss Yuan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>She clutched her handkerchief with excitement. She whispered a few words in reply to the senior servant who had come to report.</p><br/><p>The senior servant bobbed in acknowledgement and left the parlour.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had been delayed by official business and had only been able to leave the Ministry of War after 2pm. Once past the gates of the ministry, he urged his horse into a gallop and headed straight for the Ying Estate.</p><br/><p>Upon entering the estate, he was informed that the banquet had already started. A manservant guided him over to the parlour where the banquet was being held.</p><br/><p>Before He Changdi even had the chance to greet the officials in attendance at the banquet, he first sent Laiyue off to notify Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>When Laiyue returned, his expression didn\u2019t look too good.</p><br/><p>The cool aura wrapped around He Changdi dipped a few degrees in temperature when he saw Laiyue\u2019s expression. Those closest to him immediately ducked their heads out of fright at the building storm in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened! Speak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue reported everything he had been told, \u201cThird Young Master, please don\u2019t worry. Second Madam brought Third Young Madam into a side room for a change of clothes. Wenqing and Wenlan are with her, so she\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is she? Take me there now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue was good at his job and he had predicted that his master would want to see Third Young Madam for himself, so he had already brought over one of Second Madam\u2019s senior servants to lead the way.</p><br/><p>An extraordinary aura was exuding from He Changdi\u2019s tall figure. He had survived the fields of war and killed Tuhuns with his own hands, so there was a military air around him. How could an old servant who had lived years in the sheltered inner court dare to slight him?</p><br/><p>The senior servant spoke carefully without ever raising her head in front of He Sanlang. She pointed out the way with light gestures.</p><br/><p>As they drew closer to their destination, He Sanlang noticed that their surroundings were becoming more secluded. His expression turned grim.</p><br/><p>The old servant felt that the air around her was starting to become even frostier, so she wiped the cold sweat on her forehead in fright. When she saw that they were almost there, she heaved a sigh of relief inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Lord, it\u2019s right in front.\u201d</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many servants around in this quiet and secluded courtyard. When they passed the entrance, it was strangely silent.</p><br/><p>As He Changdi strode down the corridor towards the guest room, he stiffened up and halted his steps, as if something had caught his attention.</p><br/><p>His senses were sharper than most, and the first thing he could hear was the abnormal sounds of lovemaking in the room\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

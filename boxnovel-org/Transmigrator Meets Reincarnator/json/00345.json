After a few days and nights of fighting, she should have long been sound asleep in bed, but Sima Hui wasn\u2019t sleepy at all. She listened to the north wind howling outside her tent with a bitter and helpless feeling in her heart.</p><br/><p>Actually, when she had returned to the main tent, Xiaoju had already reported the day\u2019s events to her. She just hadn\u2019t expected Xiaoyan to have betrayed her expectations so badly.</p><br/><p>The corner of Sima Hui\u2019s lips tugged downwards bitterly. Xiaoyan had been too naive. Honoured Lady Jinyi had managed to teach them a lesson with nary a change in expression. How could someone like that be taken down by such a weak scheme?</p><br/><p>A few moments ago, when she had passed by the hurried Captain He, he had most likely been chasing after that Honoured Lady Jinyi.</p><br/><p>She was a little curious about this Honoured Lady Jinyi now.</p><br/><p>As Sima Hui immersed herself in her thoughts, Xiaoju brought over some food.</p><br/><p>She knew that her young miss was still angry over Xiaoyan, so Xiaoju was even more careful and conscientious in her service. \u201cGeneral, please eat. You haven\u2019t eaten anything since you\u2019ve returned!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui took a deep breath to calm her emotions and nodded.</p><br/><p>When she picked up the silver chopsticks on the table, her gaze took in the food displayed before her.</p><br/><p>Sima Hui was momentarily stunned. She asked, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there any rice today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Sima Hui\u2019s ancestors were from Shandong, her likings were more akin to her mother\u2019s, who had come from the southern parts of the country where there were many lakes and rivers. She loved rice. When she had the luxury to, she would rarely eat things made of flour as her main dish.</p><br/><p>It was usually Xiaoju who took care of her clothing and food in the main camp. She usually had rice or porridge for all three meals of the day. However, there wasn\u2019t a single grain of rice in any of the dishes before her. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Xiaoju sunk into silence, but after a moment, she said, \u201cGeneral, we\u2019ve used up all the rice we brought with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui paused in thought for a short while, but ultimately, she didn\u2019t say anything. She picked up a wheat pancake and bit into it. In the end, she had to pair it with water before she managed to swallow the tough pancake.</p><br/><p>She looked again at the other dishes. There was a small saucer of some sort of black sauce and half a plate of salted meat. She set down the wheat pancake in her hands and asked, \u201cIs this what all the officers in camp eat every day?\u201d</p><br/><p>With Xiaoyan\u2019s example before her, Xiaoju didn\u2019t dare to hide anything from her general.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is what this servant was given by the cooks in camp. Even the great general himself eats food like this. The dried meat and sauce were specially given to you because of General Qian\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui\u2019s brows furrowed. Her gut told her that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than those under my command, what do the normal soldiers eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the soldiers who aren\u2019t deployed at the frontlines, they get two bowls of bean porridge and one wheat pancake each day. The soldiers at the frontlines get three meals a day and each meal consists of one wheat pancake and a bowl of bean porridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon getting this answer, Sima Hui\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cWhen did the border troops start eating bean porridge?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoju was much more reliable than Xiaoyan. She had a conscientious personality, so she normally scouted for more news in camp.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey started eating bean porridge even before we arrived. However, that had only been for one meal a day back then. There was also some rice porridge in the morning and night. However, since the end of last month, the camp has completely stopped eating rice. The quartermaster said that they\u2019re saving the grains to pass the winter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui wasn\u2019t that naive. Her expression was full of worry. She stood up and walked over the tent entrance. The moment she lifted the flap, a bone-piercingly cold wind came barrelling in from outside, complete with ice and snow. It was enough to make anyone shiver.</p><br/><p>Saving supplies? Who would start saving supplies in winter? Their men would freeze to death if they tried to cut back in this cold weather.</p><br/><p>She was afraid that their supplies had most likely run dry\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

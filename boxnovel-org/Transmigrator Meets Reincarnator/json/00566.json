She had just found out they truly wouldn\u2019t be able to move in this position.</p><br/><p>With her covering He Changdi\u2019s eyes and He Changdi carrying her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 then set me down and I\u2019ll walk by myself,\u201d Chu Lian suggested after a long moment.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s mouth curled up into a smirk, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he moved into a stance where he seemed ready to set her down.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian abruptly recalled the difference in height between them. If he really put her down like this, she would barely be able to cover his eyes and it would take just way too much effort to do so\u2026 She would be completely exposed to his gaze anyway. Wouldn\u2019t she be stuck right back in the situation she was right now?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait!\u201d Seeing He Sanlang about to let her down, Chu Lian raised her voice in alarm.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s face was lit up with a mischievous smile. He shifted her higher up and even managed to grope a feel on her butt while he was it. A blush immediately bloomed to life on Chu Lian\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to put down your hands? Do you really want to catch a cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian bit her lip and slowly pulled her arms back down.</p><br/><p>She crossed her arms over her chest instead to hide the cherry buds on top of the \u2018hills of snow\u2019. However, it only pushed her hills together to form an even deeper and tempting valley.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s gaze travelled down her neck to behold the view of that valley. His pupils dilated with interest, but he managed to hide it quickly.</p><br/><p>He Changdi would never put Chu Lian\u2019s health at stake for a mere joke. Worried that she would really catch a cold, he swiftly carried her over to the changing screen and grabbed a large cloak. He wrapped it securely around her before running out of the bathroom with her still in his arms.</p><br/><p>He took one of the blankets from the bed and added another layer of warmth around her before calling for Wenqing to help Chu Lian dry off. Meanwhile, he turned back and re-entered the bathroom instead.</p><br/><p>When Wenqing came in to help Chu Lian dress up, she couldn\u2019t keep the smile off her face. Chu Lian was so embarrassed that she couldn\u2019t look up.</p><br/><p>The sounds of water splashing came from the bathroom. It was only then that Chu Lian realised that the bath water hadn\u2019t been changed, and that it had already cooled down by the time she was done.</p><br/><p>She hurriedly finished dressing and put on her shoes to rush over to the bathroom, only to see that her husband was already in the tub.</p><br/><p>A twitch developed at the corner of her mouth. She reminded, \u201cHubby, that water\u2019s already been used. I\u2019ll call someone to get you a fresh change of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Chu Lian could set off, He Changdi stopped her, \u201cNo need, I\u2019m already done.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he stood up from the bathtub without warning.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian got a good eyeful of his perfect figure: tightly packed abs, defined lines down his hips, and\u2026 a certain part of him that looked to be brimming with vigour\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The blush that had just faded from her cheeks came back to life, spreading all the way down to her neck this time.</p><br/><p>She was stunned speechless by the sight. It took a good moment before she managed to shift her gaze away in a panic.</p><br/><p>By then, He Changdi had already walked up to her and was nonchalantly putting on his clothes\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stomped her foot in annoyance before fleeing pathetically from the bathroom.</p><br/><p>That He Sanlang! He looked like an upright and cold man on the outside, but he was actually a great big pervert!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he way too accepting of her? He had actually used her dirty bathwater\u2026</p><br/><p>When He Sanlang stepped out of the bathroom, Senior Servant Zhong had come over to ask if they would like their meal served now.</p><br/><p>The couple had their dinner on the small table in the bedroom. It was an exceptionally fast meal and they quickly cleared the dishes.</p><br/><p>While drinking her nourishing tonic, Chu Lian stared at He Changdi with a strange expression.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang lifted one brow, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tilted her head to one side, \u201cI thought you were acting especially weird today. Why are you so rushed for time today? You even ate dinner so quickly. Do you have to go over to your study to settle some business?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

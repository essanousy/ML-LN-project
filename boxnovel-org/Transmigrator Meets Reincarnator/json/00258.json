Please read from the original source!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s offer was completely out of Matriarch He\u2019s expectations. She stiffened for a moment in surprise before tears gathered in the corners of her eyes.</p><br/><p>She knew roughly how much Guilin Restaurant earned in a month. Manager Qin had previously been one of her servants after all.</p><br/><p>She also knew that Dalang\u2019s wife had brought up that idea purely out of jealousy. In order for their family to stand stably, the inner court had to be at peace or in balance. The matriarch was gratified that Chu Lian was able to make such an offer for the greater good. At the same time, she lamented how much Madam Zou had changed.</p><br/><p>In the end, she made the final decision. \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, since you have the heart to do so, you\u2019ll be the one to pay for your mother\u2019s medicine fees from now on. However, only do so within your own capability and don\u2019t push yourself too hard. No matter what happens to you afterwards, you still have this old woman here to support you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s almond-shaped eyes turned upwards in a smile. \u201cGranddaughter-in-Law understands! I won\u2019t be too shy to ask for help from Grandmother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He dwelled in thought for a moment before turning to Madam Zou and speaking, \u201cDalang\u2019s wife, this old woman did not expect the family\u2019s shared properties to have declined to this state. The blame for this can\u2019t be placed on your shoulders, since you didn\u2019t have a capable steward to help you manage these properties. I gave Sanlang\u2019s wife a manager before, so I\u2019ll send you one as well. He\u2019ll help you with managing the estate\u2019s properties!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou looked up in shock right after Matriarch He finished speaking. Her lips trembled and parted as the urge to reject this arrangement flooded her being. However, when she met Matriarch He\u2019s sharp old eyes, any hope of struggling faded away.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Matriarch He had already detected those small tricks she had pulled with the estate\u2019s properties beforehand, but the matriarch hadn\u2019t bothered to stop it due to her trust in her. Now that she was starting to target the third branch with her schemes, Matriarch He naturally wouldn\u2019t continue letting her greed run free.</p><br/><p>Now that Matriarch He had placed a manager by her side with a completely upright reason, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to continue appropriating funds in secret.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou was filled with regret. Not only had she failed to steal Guilin Restaurant, but she had even lost her source of income to boot.</p><br/><p>When Matriarch He saw that Madam Zou had remained silent and was simply looking downwards at the floor, the matriarch frowned and raised her voice with an unhappy tone, \u201cDalang\u2019s wife, did you hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou\u2019s body shook once. Matriarch He\u2019s rage showed clearly through her voice. \u201cGranddaughter-in-Law hea.. heard you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He had already been feeling unwell these two days. After facing such a huge problem in the morning thanks to Madam Zou, her head was starting to ache.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since there\u2019s nothing else to discuss, all of you should return. Bring Little An and Little Lin back with you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou was currently feeling very low, so she left quickly with her two daughters.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was one step behind her. Just as she was about to step out of Qingxi Hall\u2019s entrance, someone with a clear voice called out from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Madam, please wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian paused and turned back to look, only to see Matriarch He\u2019s handmaid Muxiang and a few maidservants carrying some exquisite wood boxes.</p><br/><p>Muxiang hurried over in two strides, \u201cThird Young Madam, the weather has turned cold, so the matriarch has sent this servant over to escort you to Songtao Court.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, with Muxiang supporting her arm on one side and chatting to her, Chu Lian returned to Songtao Court. Following that, Muxiang instructed the maidservants behind her to place the brocade-lined boxes on the parlour\u2019s table.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are some rewards that the Empress Dowager bestowed upon the matriarch. There\u2019s a handsome white fox fur coat within; it\u2019s quite a rare treasure due to its purity. The matriarch said: a white fur coat like this wouldn\u2019t suit her at her age, but it will fit Third Young Madam perfectly. There are also a few brand new exquisite ruby and sapphire accessories. The matriarch ordered this servant to bring these over to Third Young Madam as well because they\u2019ll go along perfectly with the outfits the palace sent over for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian accepted the gifts and had Senior Servant Zhong send Muxiang off. She returned to her own little study, knowing very well that these gifts were Matriarch He\u2019s way of compensating her.</p><br/><p>She had taken a look at that white fox coat earlier. It was brand new and hadn\u2019t even been worn, so it was indeed a rather expensive gift. If not for that ruckus today, this fox coat would most likely have been given to that sister-in-law of hers, Madam Zou.</p><br/><p>Of course, the reason Chu Lian knew this was because she had read about it in the story before.</p><br/><p>However, due to her arrival in this story, she had changed some of the events.</p><br/><p>Just as Chu Lian was about to sink into her thoughts, Wenlan came in to pass a message. \u201cThird Young Madam, Manager Qin has come over. He\u2019s waiting in the parlour outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stood up to meet Manager Qin.</p><br/><p>In less than fifteen minutes, they were done with the meeting and Manager Qin left.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui had been standing behind Chu Lian during the meeting. She had a bewildered expression on her face as she asked, \u201cThird Young Madam, what is this about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just now, she had watched as Chu Lian gave Manager Qin a letter and listed out three questions. Manager Qin was to put up these three questions at the entrance of Guilin Restaurant with a notice to announce that anyone who could answer all three questions correctly would get a free meal at Guilin Restaurant.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled mysteriously, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, momo! It\u2019s not anything bad. It\u2019ll be a surprise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui was even more confused. She couldn\u2019t even start to guess at what her master was trying to do now.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, with Chu Lian\u2019s guarantee, Senior Servant Gui felt reassured.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

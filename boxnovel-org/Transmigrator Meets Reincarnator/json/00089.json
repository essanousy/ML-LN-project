All the women in Mei Court immediately focused on Chu Lian before their eyes turned to the box that Xiyan was carrying. Curiosity itched inside their hearts; they wished for the power to see through things so that they could have a peek at what House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam made.</p><br/><p>The four senior servants accompanying Chu Lian hurriedly returned to their own masters.</p><br/><p>Madam Huang\u2019s servant whispered a few lines into her ear, causing Madam Huang\u2019s expression to change. She asked in return, \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><br/><p>The senior servant nodded and said, \u201cThis old servant didn\u2019t get to see what the end result was, and didn\u2019t get the chance to taste it. House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam purposely hid the buns from us the moment she took them out of the steamer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the senior servant\u2019s reply, the tension on Madam Huang\u2019s face faded away.</p><br/><p>Heh! If she tried to hide them, that meant she wasn\u2019t confident!</p><br/><p>Anyone could learn how to make longevity peach buns. She refused to believe that a young lady who had never stepped foot into the kitchen could make buns that tasted better than Mr Wang\u2019s.</p><br/><p>After her servant had reported what she had seen, Madam Huang was even more certain that Chu Lian was simply acting the part. Furthermore, even if the buns looked good, it didn\u2019t mean that they would taste delicious. Before seeing them for herself, there was no need for her to get all flustered; that was just giving that hateful Lady Yang a chance to mock her.</p><br/><p>The senior servant was about to say more, but Madam Huang waved her hand in dismissal.</p><br/><p>She could only close her mouth and retreat a few steps to stand in the corner. Her curiosity burned in her heart as she watched Chu Lian\u2019s every move.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian walked into the middle of the crowd with her maidservants and curtsied to each of the madams. \u201cI\u2019ve made you wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao glared at Chu Lian before sneering. \u201cHow fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, please don\u2019t get angry. All she can do is act the part. Let\u2019s wait until she brings out the longevity peach buns. We\u2019ll see if she can keep acting then!\u201d Zou Yuanqin quickly said, trying to curry favour with the princess.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t stand on ceremony. Bring out the longevity peach buns!\u201d Lady Yang stated calmly.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t tarry and instructed Xiyan to place the box on the stone table in front of everyone. Then, she opened the box herself.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes were instantly concentrated on the box. All the people present, even Imperial Princess Leyao and Royal Princess Duanjia, opened their eyes wide, afraid that they would miss a moment of this exciting event.</p><br/><p>Miss Su nervously wrung the handkerchief in her hands while staring at the box. Madam Rong was both anxious and remorseful, with various emotions running through her heart. However, Miss Yuan couldn\u2019t even bear to pry her gaze away from the prizes on the tray.</p><br/><p>The crowd watched as Chu Lian took out three plates of perfectly-sized peaches and placed them on the stone table. The peaches were vibrant and lovely, full and plump; there were even a few fresh, verdant leaves on the top of the peaches with waterdrops glistening on their surfaces. These were clearly fresh, sweet peaches that had just been plucked off a branch!</p><br/><p>The noble madams present stared at the peaches in a daze, and some of them even gaped in surprise.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a young voice cried out in shock, \u201cAh! Those aren\u2019t fresh peaches! Those were made!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl\u2019s voice rang out clearly, travelling into the ears of everyone present.</p><br/><p>What? Those weren\u2019t fresh peaches? They were longevity peach buns?!</p><br/><p>The young girl realised that she had spoken out of turn and quickly covered her mouth. Her face flushed as she glanced at her mother beside her. The madam knew that her daughter had been lacking in manners, so she apologised to the madams around her. While apologising, she explained, \u201cWhen House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam brought those buns out, I thought they were fresh peaches too. I didn\u2019t realise they were buns until I spotted the steam rising off these \u2018peaches\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl and madam were standing near the stone table, so they had quickly spotted the difference.</p><br/><p>After her explanation, all the madams in Mei Court were even more stunned. Those realistic longevity peach buns were really made of flour and weren\u2019t actually fresh peaches!?</p><br/><p>Even Lady Yang and Wei Fengzi had their interests piqued.</p><br/><p>Madam Huang was staring straight at the buns with extreme disbelief in her eyes. The way she was tightly clutching onto her handkerchief revealed her unwillingness to concede.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if they look realistic? It\u2019s not enough to win against Mr Wang\u2019s longevity peach buns if they don\u2019t taste right!\u201d Imperial Princess Leyao couldn\u2019t hold back her anger and was the first to reply.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They were lacking one more piece of fir wood?</p><br/><p>Leader Mo was filled with regret as he remembered the pieces of wood he had carelessly burned earlier.</p><br/><p>When he looked at how Manager Qin was hobbling away while holding on to his behind, he felt even more anxious. At this rate, wouldn\u2019t he take too long to find more fir wood?</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui followed closely behind Manager Qin and said, \u201cManager Qin, you\u2019re injured, so leave this matter to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin looked him up and down and snorted in his heart. This Mo Chenggui was making his two-faced act so obvious that he felt irritated just looking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to go, then go ahead. I\u2019m not holding you back. However, since this is something that Third Young Madam has ordered me to do, I have to do my best to complete my task no matter what!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, Manager Qin tossed his sleeves and hurried away while bearing with the pain from his injury, completely ignoring Mo Chenggui.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui knew that he had gone overboard with his actions previously. However, what was done was done. He couldn\u2019t turn back time. He gritted his teeth and led a party of his men out to search for fir wood as well.</p><br/><p>After four hours, it was still Manager Qin who found some supplies of fir wood first and sent it back to the He Estate. He had already gone out to buy wood a few times, so he had some connections.</p><br/><p>In just a short moment, the object that Chu Lian had entrusted to the old carpenter to bought was completed.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian ordered her people to move the object to one of the more deserted courtyards. She then ordered them to harness horses to the object and test how the object moved over an area that was covered in knee-deep snow.</p><br/><p>When she saw that there were only two shallow tracks on the snow where the horses had apssed, Chu Lian then passed orders to Manager Qin to have heavy items put on top of the object for another test.</p><br/><p>The result? The horses were actually able to maintain a normal speed even while pulling a load of goods!</p><br/><p>Manager Qin couldn\u2019t help but cry out in surprise, \u201cThird Young Madam, it was a success!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian heaved a sigh of relief and let out a refreshed smile. With this, they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the problem of transporting goods through heavy snow!</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan had simliar expressions of joy. Wenlan asked excitedly, \u201cThird Young Madam, what is this thing called?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s almond-shaped eyes were curved into crescents as she spoke in a tender and soft tone, \u201cA snowboat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA snowboat? A boat that can travel over snow?\u201d Manager Qin\u2019s eyes lit up and he praised her, \u201cWhat a fitting name.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old carpenter and his helpers were already smiling from ear to ear as they watched from the side.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian came closer to examine the \u2018snowboat\u2019. Actually, it was a sleigh that was commonly used during winter in the northeast of China back in the modern world. It could also be called a sled, but there were some differences between sleds and sleighs.</p><br/><p>There were many different types of sleighs, but the one she had drawn out was most suited for transporting goods. It was slightly larger than most sleighs and should be able to withstand the same load that normal carriages could. They could even create a small warm pen on top of the sleigh by putting up a tent of animal skins and leaving small windows at the side for ventilation. With braziers within for warmth, they would be able to travel long distances without getting frozen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

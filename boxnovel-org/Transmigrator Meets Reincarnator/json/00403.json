Once Chu Lian had gotten close to this heat source, she subconsciously wanted to get even closer. It was all part of her natural instincts.</p><br/><p>In order to hug her heat source tight, one of her legs even found its way onto He Sanlang\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The cool-faced He Changdi looked down at Chu Lian for a moment as his body stiffened up. After some time, he simply let her do as she liked.</p><br/><p>The two of them were each down to a single layer of clothing now, which was made of a thin material. He Sanlang had one arm under Chu Lian\u2019s neck while the other circled around her slender waist.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was exhaling warm puffs of air around He Changdi\u2019s collarbone. One of her hands had subconsciously curled around the collar of He Changdi\u2019s shirt, like she trusted and relied on him.</p><br/><p>The couple was stuck close to each other without any gaps between them.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s cool mask had melted a little by now. When his arms were filled with Chu Lian\u2019s presence, it felt as if his heart was full too.</p><br/><p>Hidden from Chu Lian\u2019s view, He Changdi sighed lightly in satisfaction and shut his eyes, as if he was about to join Chu Lian in slumber.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t rested for a very long time in order to look for Chu Lian. His nerves had been tightly wound up all the while until she had finally returned to his arms again, so he was rather tired by now.</p><br/><p>His eyelids slowly slid shut and he was just about to fall asleep when Chu Lian suddenly moved. She wriggled as if trying to burrow deeper into his embrace. It seemed like her current position wasn\u2019t too comfortable and she wanted to change into a better one.</p><br/><p>After Chu Lian moved, He Changdi completely lost all traces of sleepiness.</p><br/><p>He loosened his hold on her and let Chu Lian shift into a more comfortable position. Once she had fallen back into deep slumber, he slowly tightened his arms around her again, keeping her safe and secure in his embrace.</p><br/><p>However, after all that movement, He Sanlang didn\u2019t feel like sleeping any longer.</p><br/><p>He sighed helplessly and stared blankly at his surroundings while hugging Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>After a short moment, He Changdi started to feel that something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>His expression changed and his ears started to flush red.</p><br/><p>While Chu Lian was ensconced in his arms, she was breathing out directly over his Adam\u2019s apple. The warm puffs of her breaths were making his mouth dry.</p><br/><p>He had been too worried earlier to think about how intimate their actions were. Now that he had calmed down, everything that had escaped his notice earlier was standing out. It was hard for him to ignore it again.</p><br/><p>Since the two of them were bundled so tightly together and wearing thin clothing, he could feel the softness of her chest on his.</p><br/><p>The palm that he had placed on Chu Lian\u2019s waist suddenly felt burning hot. He completely froze up, not daring to make the slightest bit of movement.</p><br/><p>He forcefully adjusted his breathing, trying to make himself calm down.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s tall body was now tensed up like a drawn bow.</p><br/><p>A bow that was already pulled to its limits and about to shoot at any moment with all its stored energy.</p><br/><p>The sleeping Chu Lian just had to start getting restless at this moment.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had been tensing his body in restraint due to the strange sensations overcoming his body. Thus, he had lost control over the strength of his arms, which turned into tight bars around Chu Lian. Chu Lian wanted to escape the uncomfortably tight hold around her, so she started to wriggle.</p><br/><p>She rubbed her body against He Changdi\u2019s and let out an uncomfortable moan. It was then that He Changdi finally realised that he was crushing her. He let go of her in panic, a light blush dyeing his handsome face pink.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wriggled a few more times before realising that the uncomfortable bindings around her had disappeared. She smacked her lips and slipped back into peaceful slumber.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s body remained stiff for a long time after that. It wasn\u2019t until Chu Lian stopped moving that he finally dared to move. The pen\u2019s surface area was small so there was only so much space for them to sleep on.</p><br/><p>Afraid that she would still be affected by the cold, He Changdi could only attempt to hug Chu Lian once again, but more carefully this time.</p><br/><p>He reached out towards her under the blanket and wrapped his arm around Chu Lian\u2019s waist. However, in the next second, what his fingers touched wasn\u2019t soft and smooth fabric, but something soft and warm.</p><br/><p>His body froze up once again. This time, his whole face turned a bright lobster red. The thoughts that he had managed to suppress earlier came flooding back into his mind.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s earlier movements had caused her clothes to unravel a little, revealing some of the smooth skin around her waist.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang wanted to remove his scorching hot palm from Chu Lian\u2019s bare skin, but it was stuck and he couldn\u2019t move it at all\u2026</p><br/><p>Although He Changdi\u2019s expression remained as cool as usual, the raging blush on his face revealed his inner turmoil. He gulped a mouthful of saliva with difficulty.</p><br/><p>He looked down at the woman in his arms.</p><br/><p>Her lips were currently formed into a pout and her hair was slightly messy. A few strands had fallen over her flushed cheeks, right under her eyes. Her cute little nose was twitching slightly.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s gaze couldn\u2019t help but follow the line of her nose down to Chu Lian\u2019s slightly parted red lips.</p><br/><p>He pressed his dry lips together.</p><br/><p>His face moved closer to her, inch by inch, until he could feel the warmth of her breath on his face. At this point, he forced himself to stop.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was fighting a massive battle in his heart. His breathing became more hurried. In the end, he could no longer hold himself back and he placed a light kiss on Chu Lian\u2019s soft lips.</p><br/><p>The palm resting at her waist glided over her skin before moving upwards in a very natural movement.</p><br/><p>He still remembered the heavenly softness that had been pressed against his hard chest earlier, tempting him to lose control of himself\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

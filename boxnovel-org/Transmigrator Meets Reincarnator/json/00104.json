After moving just two steps away, Countess Jing\u2019an instructed from behind him, \u201cCome back a little earlier for tonight\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the various branches of the Jing\u2019an Estate didn\u2019t usually take their meals together, they would eat dinner together in the middle and end of every month. Everyone would gather in Qingxi Hall and strengthen their family bonds.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye, I understand. I won\u2019t be late for my meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an noticed that Miaozhen was still staring distractedly after her eldest son, long after he was gone.</p><br/><p>She inwardly sighed.</p><br/><p>Five years ago, Miaozhen had fallen into one of the ponds in the estate by accident and the passing He Changqi had saved her. It was likely then that this girl had fallen in love with him.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the He Family had that rule against taking concubines.</p><br/><p>However, Dalang had been married to Madam Zou for quite a number of years and they still didn\u2019t have any sons. Furthermore, Madam Zou had suffered some complications after giving birth to Little Lin. Little Lin was already four this year, but there was no news of another pregnancy from Dalang\u2019s wife.</p><br/><p>Dalang was about to hit the age when he would be allowed to take a concubine, since he had no sons.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an abruptly made a decision.</p><br/><p>She pulled Miaozhen\u2019s hands into her own and smiled as she asked, \u201cMiaozhen, what do you think about the heir?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Miaozhen hadn\u2019t expected Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s sudden question; her face flushed red and her soul seemed to have flown to the far reaches of the earth in her panic.</p><br/><p>She quickly cast a sideways glance at the countess, but she couldn\u2019t read the expression on Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s face at all. The redness on her face gave way to pallor and she knelt to the ground with a thump. Trembling, she said, \u201cThis servant has such a lowly identity, this servant doesn\u2019t dare to have any thoughts of the heir.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she placed her head on the footrest before the bed, shaking like a leaf in the wind. She didn\u2019t dare to say another word.</p><br/><p>As one of Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s handmaids, she knew the rules of the estate clearly. The men of the family were only allowed to take a concubine if they didn\u2019t have any male heirs when they reached the age of thirty. Thus, she had quickly cut off her own desires for Heir Jing\u2019an. She would daydream of that unattainable man only when she was alone, but because she had gotten a little lost in her thoughts just now, the countess had actually discovered that the object of her affections was Eldest Young Master.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an was a little startled; it was only now that she realised her silly handmaid had misunderstood her intentions and thought that she was angry that Miaozhen had stepped out of bounds for daring to long for her eldest son.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an sighed helplessly. She reached out to pull the trembling Miaozhen up and glared at her. \u201cYou silly girl. How could I possibly think like that? Alright, I\u2019m not blaming you. Just tell me honestly, what do you think about Dalang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miaozhen stared at Countess Jing\u2019an in a daze. It took a long moment before she looked down with a flush that spread all the way to her neck. \u201cHeir\u2026 Heir Jing\u2019an is\u2026 tall and\u2026 handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an burst out into laughter. Tall and handsome? As his mother, she knew better than anyone what her eldest son was like.</p><br/><p>If Dalang\u2019s burnt skin and ruffian-like appearance could still be considered tall and handsome, then love really was blind. If Miaozhen had used that description on Sanlang, she might have believed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I understand. Miaozhen, don\u2019t worry about it and continue serving at my side for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s words, Miaozhen\u2019s heart almost leapt out of her throat.</p><br/><p>In the Yang Estate, Lord Yang had just returned from Wenhua Hall. He had taken care of quite a few tricky tasks today, so he was more tired than usual, and was even hungrier than he usually was.</p><br/><p>When Lord Yang reached the outer court\u2019s parlour, he just happened to see a steward carefully bringing in an exquisitely decorated box, and paused in his steps.</p><br/><p>The steward saw that the master of the house had returned, so he quickly came over to greet his master.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Lord Yang tilted his chin towards the box in the steward\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying to Master, this was sent by someone from the Jing\u2019an Estate. They said that it\u2019s a return gift for the madam, and that it\u2019s food, so we can\u2019t leave it for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Jing\u2019an Estate? Food? Could it be those longevity peach buns from Marquis Dingyuan\u2019s feast?</p><br/><p>While on the way back to their estate yesterday, Lord and Lady Yang had been talking about the interesting events behind Chu Lian making longevity peach buns. Lord Yang hadn\u2019t been able to set his pride aside to request for a bun, so they had been on his mind for a while.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

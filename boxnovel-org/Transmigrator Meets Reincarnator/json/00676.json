Now she thought back to what He Changdi had first said to her and she finally understood his meaning. She tugged at He Changdi\u2019s collar unhappily, \u201cYou can handle it however you like. I don\u2019t want to see her again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi mulled over it. He didn\u2019t want her to have to take care of such matter even while she was pregnant. Furthermore, she was carrying their child, so she shouldn\u2019t see anything bloody. He Changdi sunk deeper into thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall I get another two maidservants for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head, \u201cNo need, let\u2019s wait until our child is born before we add any more servants to the household.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were already plenty of servants around her. Two days ago, Princess Wei had even specially sent over a senior servant and some maidservants specialising in caring for pregnant noblewomen.</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t push the issue and simply enjoyed holding her. He breathed in the faint fragrance emanating from her body and shut his eyes.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian played with the collar on his chest and asked in a soft voice, \u201cWere you busy the whole night?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi made a tired groan in response.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian thought for a bit before moving back a little. Looking at the sky outside, the sun would likely rise in less than two hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here, why don\u2019t you sleep for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi had only been holding her at the edge of the bed. When he opened his eyes and saw that she had given up more than half of the bed for him, he smiled, \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re really getting more and more daring. Aren\u2019t you afraid that the <i>momos</i> will nag you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blushed before glaring at him, \u201cAre you going to sleep or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi moved his body and took up all the space she had offered. He didn\u2019t even take off any of his clothes, simply holding her loosely in his embrace.</p><br/><p>Since finding out about Chu Lian\u2019s pregnancy, the two senior servants had forbidden the couple to sleep on the same bed. He Changdi normally slept next to the bed on a chaise. It was now a rare chance for him to sleep together with his wife.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t hugged Chu Lian to sleep for so long. As he breathed in her naturally sweet scent, he quickly drifted off into dreamland.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shifted her position within his arms and lifted her chin to look at He Changdi\u2019s features, softened by sleep. She couldn\u2019t resist reaching out to stroke his skin.</p><br/><p>There were dark circles under his eyes, showing how he had worked the whole night.</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian didn\u2019t really ask about what He Changdi was doing at court, from the first half of the novel that she had read, she could guess at some things.</p><br/><p>While things seemed calm in the capital for now, there was actually a storm brewing underneath. Ever since the crown prince had presented the fake phoenix to the emperor, there had been more and more of his ugly news revealed. Finally, the corruption case in Chaozhou had been exposed. While the crown prince was still holding on to his position, he had already been grounded in the east palace for close to two months.</p><br/><p>This grounding was basically equal to imprisonment. The officials on the crown prince\u2019s side had made their moves: some of them had switched sides, and some of them had resigned. There were barely any supporters of the crown prince left.</p><br/><p>It was practically a fact that the emperor had already taken away the title of crown prince from Second Prince, all that remained was the formalities.</p><br/><p>By now, the factions of Sixth Prince and Fourth Prince were already going against each other in secret.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had been working through the night likely due to a major incident in their faction.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know much of politics in court and didn\u2019t have any subordinates who could be of use, so she couldn\u2019t help him directly. The only way she could contribute was likely through money.</p><br/><p>The first batch of tea that she had prepared in early spring had already been sent to Dejufeng. She would likely get the results from that tea soon.</p><br/><p>Deep in her thoughts, Chu Lian didn\u2019t notice the passing of time. In the blink of an eye, it was time for He Changdi to head out to court.</p><br/><p>Wenqing called out from outside to remind them of the time. Before Chu Lian could wake He Changdi, he had already opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still sleepy?\u201d Chu Lian rubbed his slightly prickly chin and placed a kiss on it with a mischievous smile.</p><br/><p>The sight of her rosy cheeks riled up the desire in He Changdi\u2019s heart. He returned the kiss with force, but on her lips. Only when he had had his fill, did he stop and try to calm the fires burning in his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get up now, otherwise I won\u2019t make it in time for court. You can sleep a little longer. When I return, let\u2019s go to the old residence together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Chu Lian wasn\u2019t that sleepy either. She had already slept more than enough in the day and earlier at night. Even if she had only laid down with her eyes open for two hours, she still felt rather energetic.</p><br/><p>She got up and helped He Changdi to find his court robes. She then personally instructed Xiyan to prepare breakfast before accompanying He Changdi for the meal. Chu Lian sent him off at the gates.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked over the servants following after He Changdi and noticed that Laiyue wasn\u2019t there. She found it strange and remarked on it, \u201cWhere\u2019s Laiyue? Has he gone somewhere to skive off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing chuckled awkwardly, \u201cHe did something wrong yesterday and he\u2019s been punished by Master. He\u2019s currently lying in bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was surprised, \u201cHe was beaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing nodded and held out two fingers, \u201cTwenty strikes of the rod.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mouth twitched. She had a rough guess at why Laiyue had been punished. She glanced at Wenqing and noticed the concerned expression on her face, so she ordered, \u201cGo and prepare some ointment and snacks. Visit him on my behalf. He\u2019s been a loyal servant of your master for so long after all, and it wasn\u2019t entirely his fault what happened last night.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

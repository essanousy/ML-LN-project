However, she\u2019s still young and she\u2019s only just come of age. There were so many ladies in the Ying Estate, how could they have taught every single one properly? She\u2019s lacking in many areas! Let her follow at your side and learn everything slowly. Once she\u2019s familiar with the household, it\u2019s not too late to ask her to shoulder bigger responsibilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Matriarch He heard that that was the original meaning behind his words, she stared at him in rebuke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo our Sanlang is someone who pampers his wife. Well, you\u2019re right. Your wife is still rather young; she should come and learn by Grandmother\u2019s side. Don\u2019t worry, Grandmother won\u2019t forget about your wife. Grandmother must have been born to toil; I still have to worry over these things even when I\u2019m already this old.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, there was some sense in what He Sanlang had said. Chu Lian had lost her mother at an early age, and as the saying went: \u2018With a new stepmother, fathers turn into stepfathers\u2019 1. It was already a miracle that Chu Lian was this ignorant and meek, having grown up in those circumstances. They couldn\u2019t be too demanding on the rest. Back in the Ying Estate, she probably hadn\u2019t been taught much. So, Matriarch He thought it was indeed sensible to have Chu Lian learn the necessary skills by shadowing her. Chu Lian seemed to be smart; the duty of managing a household would fall upon her sooner or later, and it was best to have her prepared when the time came.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had achieved his goal, so he inwardly heaved a sigh of relief and quickly refuted his grandmother\u2019s claim of being old.</p><br/><p>Actually, Matriarch He really couldn\u2019t be considered that old. She hadn\u2019t even reached sixty years of age. Although she had some minor ailments here and there, her body was in rather good condition thus far.</p><br/><p>For He Sanlang, only one thing mattered. As long as the power of managing the household didn\u2019t fall into Chu Lian\u2019s hands, her little ploys were unlikely to succeed!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t anyone come back to report?\u201d Matriarch He was starting to get impatient from waiting.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had been about to get up and find out what happened when he saw a few people walking in from the garden outside. The person leading them was actually Madam Zou!</p><br/><p>Following behind Madam Zou was one of her senior servants. Walking right at the very end was Laiyue.</p><br/><p>He Changdi and Matriarch He were floored by this sight.</p><br/><p>It was Matriarch He who reacted first. She leaned heavily on her cane as she stepped forward to welcome them. Her personal maidservant hurriedly supported the old matriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Granddaughter-in-Law, you\u2019re fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou pinched the space between her brows and entered the parlour. She then supported Matriarch He from her other side and got her to sit back down on the soft couch. \u201cGrandmother, Granddaughter-in-Law is fine. Please don\u2019t worry too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that Madam Zou was fine, Matriarch He still carefully inspected her, sweeping a gaze up and down for any injuries. After confirming that she looked absolutely alright, Matriarch He was finally able to relax.</p><br/><p>Following that, she turned to look at He Changdi with a strange expression. \u201cSanlang, what\u2019s this? Your Eldest Sister-in-Law is just fine. Why did you come here in a panic asking for an imperial physician?! You\u2019re just making trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi was also stunned. Countless thoughts tumbled about in his head.</p><br/><p>What? How? In his previous life, Eldest Sister-in-Law had clearly suffered serious burns. She had even lost a leg because they hadn\u2019t been able to get the imperial physician here in time. Chu Lian had also taken over the management of the He Household because of this fire. She had then proceeded to steal from the household funds, funneling all that money into Xiao Wujing!</p><br/><p>However, Eldest Sister-in-Law was now standing completely undamaged before him.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s expression turned dark. He pressed his thin lips together, speechless.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Madam Zou reacted quickly. \u201cGrandmother, please don\u2019t panic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou took the teacup from a maidservant\u2019s hand and passed it to Matriarch He before she slowly explained. \u201cGranddaughter-in-Law came here to report that the main kitchen caught on fire. Granddaughter-in-Law was about to enter the main kitchen to brew some medicine for Mother at the time. If I hadn\u2019t bumped into Third Sister-in-Law in the gardens outside and chatted for a short while with her, Granddaughter-in-Law might\u2019ve really been injured! Third Brother must have heard the servants along the way mention that I had gone to the main kitchen, so that\u2019s why he thought that Granddaughter-in-Law was injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she finished speaking, Madam Zou turned to He Changdi. \u201cThird Brother, wasn\u2019t that what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything had been messed up. He Changdi struggled to maintain his composure and nodded towards Matriarch He. \u201cYes, Grandmother. I thought that Eldest Sister-in-Law was injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou\u2019s reasoning made sense. Matriarch He nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did the main kitchen catch on fire? Are there any casualties in our household? What\u2019s the situation like now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue came up to report at this time. \u201cReporting to Matriarch, we don\u2019t know the cause of the fire yet. As it happened around mealtime, quite a few senior and junior servants, as well as the cooks, have been gravely injured. I\u2019m afraid Cook Zhou isn\u2019t likely to survive the night\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He froze for a moment before sighing with great pity. At the same time, she addressed Laiyue with an order. \u201cInform the main steward. Tell him that he needs to find the cause of this fire, as well as take care of the injured servants. As for Cook Zhou\u2026 If you have the time, arrange a visit with her. After all, we\u2019ve enjoyed the sweets she\u2019s made for so many years\u2026 It would only be proper to say a few words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue hurriedly went off to obey the orders.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou patted the back of Matriarch He\u2019s hand in reassurance. \u201cGrandmother, please don\u2019t worry. What happened was just too sudden; there wasn\u2019t anything that could be done. We can only say that it was Cook Zhou\u2019s fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He held Madam Zou\u2019s hand and patted her. \u201cLuckily you made it out alright! If anything happened to you, how would Grandmother answer to Dalang and your two little girls?! Thank goodness for Sanlang\u2019s wife. That girl carries fortune with her; she might even be our He Family\u2019s lucky star! She\u2019s so young and you\u2019re her elder sister-in-law. Do take more care of her. Since she was talking to you in the garden, she must have seen the fire personally. She might still be in shock right now! Do visit her and take a look at her tomorrow when you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou warmly smiled. \u201cI understand. I heard that Third Sister-in-Law likes brewing sencha; I have some good quality sencha with me, so I\u2019ll send some to her when I visit tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Matriarch He patted Madam Zou\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Waves were churning in He Sanlang\u2019s heart as he listened to his grandmother and sister-in-law speaking.</p><br/><p>What\u2026 What was going on? How did that wicked woman get such a high evaluation in their hearts this time around?!</p><br/><p>1. With a new stepmother, fathers turn into stepfathers \u2013 meaning that fathers don\u2019t treat their children as well once there\u2019s a new wife in the house.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

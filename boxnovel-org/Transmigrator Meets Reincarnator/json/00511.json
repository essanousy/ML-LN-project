Several minutes later, the plate of candied hawthorns that Chu Lian had personally made was placed on the sandalwood table in the center of the parlour.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian walked over to the table and pointed at the tasty-looking candied hawthorns on the white porcelain plate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do all of you think this is?\u201d Chu Lian asked.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was keeping a close watch on Chu Lian. After hearing her question, an idea popped up in his mind.</p><br/><p>Eldest Madam covered her mouth and tittered loudly, \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, you\u2019re not trying to stall time, right? We\u2019re not blind. Do you think we can\u2019t recognise hawthorns?\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an seemed rather puzzled as well, \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, these are the candied hawthorns that you sent over. I\u2019ve tried them myself. The sweet and sour taste was really appetising.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s lips lifted up into a smile and she called over one of the maidservants in the parlour.</p><br/><p>The maidservant trembled with fear. She kept her head lowered as she asked in a shaky voice, \u201cThird\u2026Third Young Madam, what do you require of this servant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian held up a sugar-coated hawthorn and handed it to the maidservant, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try one, and then tell me what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The maidservant was clearly relieved to hear that it was such a simple request. She timidly took the hawthorn ball from Chu Lian\u2019s pale and delicate fingertips and slowly placed it in her mouth.</p><br/><p>The sweet and sour taste spread on her tongue. It was neither too sweet nor too greasy. After eating one, there was an irresistible urge to have another.</p><br/><p>After carefully chewing and swallowing it, the maidservant couldn\u2019t resist smacking her lips a couple of times as if she was trying to bring back the taste of the hawthorn ball she just ate.</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying to Third Young Madam, it\u2019s hawthorn. It tasted really good. It\u2019s the first time this servant has eaten such a delicious hawthorn.\u201d The hawthorns that she ate were usually very sour. She had never thought that it could be so tasty when it was prepared in this way.</p><br/><p>The gluttonous maidservant couldn\u2019t help glancing at the plate of candied hawthorns a couple more times.</p><br/><p>He Ying rolled her eyes, but Chu Lian let out a smile.</p><br/><p>She waved her hand to dismiss the maidservant. She then took another hawthorn ball and walked towards Great Doctor Miao.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao smiled, \u201cHonoured Lady, you wouldn\u2019t be asking this old man to taste one as well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at him with an expression that read, \u2018you should know what to do\u2019.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao found it funny and shook his head with a grin. He took the hawthorn ball and sniffed it first. After that, he broke it apart and carefully examined the ingredients inside. Finally, he burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>He stood up, holding half a hawthorn in each hand, and strode towards Matriarch He.</p><br/><p>He lifted his hand respectfully, \u201cMatriarch He, this isn\u2019t hawthorn. It\u2019s a special type of gooseberry from the northern border. Its taste is very similar to a hawthorn, but its effect is completely different. Hawthorns are good for digestion and circulation, but pregnant women shouldn\u2019t eat too much of it. The gooseberries from the northern border possess a warmer attribute. It can nourish vitality and calm the mind. It can even be used as an ingredient for medicines to stabilise pregnancies. For pregnant women, there\u2019s no harm at all in eating this. It\u2019s even beneficial to their pregnancy.\u201d</p><br/><p>When compared like this, the medical properties of the northern gooseberries that Chu Lian used were quite close to those of wild ginseng.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao\u2019s words shocked nearly everyone in the parlour.</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Those confections on the table weren\u2019t hawthorns, and they were some kind of gooseberry from the northern border instead?!</p><br/><p>How could that be!</p><br/><p>If that really wasn\u2019t a plate of hawthorns, then this incident had nothing to with Chu Lian at all!</p><br/><p>There was one person whose expression couldn\u2019t be described with just the word \u2018shocked\u2019.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou\u2019s face had instantly turned deathly pale and she clenched her hands tightly under her wide sleeves. She didn\u2019t even notice when her sharp nails had pierced the skin of her palms.</p><br/><p>A strange look appeared in He Changdi\u2019s eyes after Great Doctor Miao revealed the truth.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He, He Ying, and even Miss Pan were unconvinced.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? This is clearly hawthorn!\u201d Matriarch He was still doubtful.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao scoffed, \u201cIf the matriarch doesn\u2019t believe this old man\u2019s words, then you can go ask the imperial physicians from the palace to distinguish them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the people in the parlour were convinced after Great Doctor Miao said that.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian bobbed towards Matriarch He and Countess Jing\u2019an, \u201cGrandmother, Mother, I\u2019m done speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s face was full of guilt, \u201cLian\u2019er, Mother has wronged you.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Matriarch He didn\u2019t apologise. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, as if she was calming her fluctuating emotions. She opened her eyes a long while later.</p><br/><p>Her gaze swept over everyone in the parlour before she let out a small sigh, \u201cSince this matter has nothing to do with Sanlang\u2019s wife, then Sanlang\u2019s wife can go sit to one side!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then that Chu Lian turned around and returned to her seat beside He Changdi.</p><br/><p>When He Sanlang caught sight of the tranquil and serene look in Chu Lian\u2019s almond-shaped eyes, his heart felt painfully sour. So the reason she had refused to let him intervene earlier was because she had already taken precautions beforehand.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for her lack of trust in Grandmother and Mother, why would Chu Lian have prepared a backup plan for everything?</p><br/><p>Did that also mean that she had some backup plans for him?</p><br/><p>The storm brewing in He Sanlang\u2019s expression worsened when he thought about this possibility.</p><br/><p>He Changdi and Chu Lian were too occupied with their own thoughts to listen to what Matriarch He had to say until a loud smack jolted them back to reality. They watched as the table in front of the matriarch trembled from the force of the old lady\u2019s blow, followed by an angry bellow from the matriarch, \u201cThis old woman wants this matter investigated thoroughly! Even if this estate is turned upside down, this old lady wants to know who the culprit behind this terrible incident is!\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch was really furious now!</p><br/><p>Anyone with a few brain cells could tell that Chu Lian had been framed by someone.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many family members in House Jing\u2019an to begin with, so Matriarch He was extremely sensitive about anything that endangered the children of their house and their bloodline. In House Jing\u2019an, little schemes against one another could be tolerated. Even coveting the family\u2019s wealth could be forgiven. However, plotting to harm their bloodline was absolutely forbidden!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

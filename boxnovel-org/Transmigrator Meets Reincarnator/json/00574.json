Matriarch He was using her responsibility as a daughter-in-law to pressure her. If she didn\u2019t take over the management of the household, then she would deemed unfilial.</p><br/><p>While standing beside them, Chu Lian frowned slightly. She didn\u2019t understand Matriarch He\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>Although she wanted to speak up for her mother-in-law, the matriarch and Madam Liu were both her elders. She was in no position to speak right now.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an was soft-hearted. She didn\u2019t dare to disobey the matriarch upfront. Thus, she reluctantly agreed.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t decline because she didn\u2019t have any legitimate reason to refuse.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t managed the household in the past because she had been seriously ill and she didn\u2019t have the energy to do it. She had even needed the matriarch\u2019s help to take care of her. However, her health had gotten better now. Since the matriarch had personally requested to hand over the rights to manage the household to her, she didn\u2019t have any good reason to decline.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an grasped the handkerchief in her hand, stood up, and bobbed towards the matriarch, \u201cMother, please rest assured. I\u2019ll do my best to manage the household.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and stand up. You\u2019ve just recovered, so there\u2019s no need to keep bowing like that. Well then, I\u2019ll rest easy now that you\u2019ll be taking care of the household affairs. If you have any questions, feel free to ask Muxiang and Miss Ying.\u201d A smile finally appeared on the matriarch\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, Countess Jing\u2019an returned to her courtyard with several maidservants, each carrying a stack of account books.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian followed behind her mother-in-law. She noticed that the countess was frowning deeply, and she appeared to be laden with worry. She tried consoling Countess Jing\u2019an, \u201cMother, you don\u2019t have to worry too much. We don\u2019t have that many people in our estate. There\u2019s only a head steward and an assisting steward in the outer court. There are also plenty of senior servants acting as stewards in the inner court. As long as you keep these people in check and you look over the account books thoroughly, there shouldn\u2019t be any major problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an was a little embarrassed. She smiled apologetically at Chu Lian, \u201cI\u2019m really useless. At this age, I still need reassurance from a young girl like you. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not that easily fooled. When I married into House Jing\u2019an, I did manage the household for several years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that Mother thinks of it this way. If you need any help, you can send someone to Songtao Court to find me. I don\u2019t have much to do anyway. Although I\u2019ve never managed a household before, I can help you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an felt more relaxed after Chu Lian\u2019s offer of help.</p><br/><p>She nodded and told her to return to her courtyard for some rest.</p><br/><p>She patted Chu Lian\u2019s hand, \u201cAlright, it\u2019s just some minor household affairs. I have senior servants who can assist me as well, so I\u2019ll be fine. You should concentrate on nourishing your body. I\u2019m still waiting for my grandsons!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s face immediately reddened due to her mother-in-law\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>She had never thought about having children at such a young age. Back then, she had even thought about finding a nice and quiet place to live out a rural lifestyle in seclusion. However, with the passage of time and the progression of her relationship with He Changdi, she was actually starting to hope that a child would form in her belly as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>She and He Changdi could watch their adorable little child grow up, bit by bit. They could raise him or her together.</p><br/><p>After sending Chu Lian off with her servants, Madam Liu returned to her own courtyard and headed directly for her study.</p><br/><p>She had much to do today, and she wasn\u2019t going to have any free time to take care of her granddaughters. She sat in front of her desk and flipped open the account books. It didn\u2019t take long before Countess Jing\u2019an discovered many suspicious gaps in them.</p><br/><p>She was dumbfounded after making a rough calculation of the estate\u2019s assets. Why were there so few stores and properties left in the public accounts?</p><br/><p>Judging by these calculations, the monthly income probably wouldn\u2019t even hit five hundred taels\u2026</p><br/><p>Moreover, that was under the assumption that the stores were turning a profit\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She came over with a friendly smile and walked up to Matriarch He\u2019s side, bobbing in greeting. Matriarch He was about to return the greeting, but was held up by Lady Pan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMatriarch He, you\u2019re already at a grand age, please don\u2019t stand on ceremony with me. I don\u2019t see Countess Jing\u2019an with you today; how is her health now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, as if they hadn\u2019t panicked over losing their round cakes just moments earlier. With a calm expression, she amiably replied, \u201cI thank you for your kind thoughts in place of my daughter-in-law, Lady Pan. Her body is still a little weak, so she sent a reply to the palace a few days ago, explaining that she couldn\u2019t make it to the banquet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lady Pan\u2019s gaze casually passed over the two ladies standing behind Matriarch He before focusing on Chu Lian\u2019s young and tender face. Her smile grew even warmer. \u201cThis lady behind you must be your newest granddaughter-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is. Sanlang\u2019s wife may be young, but she\u2019s very sensible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Matriarch He\u2019s words, Chu Lian bobbed in greeting to Lady Pan.</p><br/><p>The smile on Lady Pan\u2019s face hadn\u2019t budged an inch. \u201cWhat great fortune you have, Matriarch He. Your granddaughter-in-law is a sensible one, and she\u2019s also a lady from House Ying. It won\u2019t be too long before you\u2019ll get to play with a great-grandson, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lady Pan\u2019s sudden shift in topic caused the expressions of the three madams from House Jing\u2019an to change.</p><br/><p>Noting the fertility of the ladies of House Ying was a slight to Chu Lian. Mentioning a great-grandson was to provoke Madam Zou, who hadn\u2019t produced a heir for the family line yet. Saying that it wouldn\u2019t be too long now was slapping both Chu Lian and Matriarch He in the face.</p><br/><p>In the entire capital, who didn\u2019t know of the news that House Jing\u2019an\u2019s He Sanlang had entered the army just three days after his marriage? Without her husband at home, what did it mean if the wife was suddenly pregnant?</p><br/><p>This Lady Pan, who seemingly hadn\u2019t done any wrong on the surface, was actually a master of provocation.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was more experienced on this end. After a spark of rage had passed through her eyes, she quickly regained her calm. \u201cLady Pan, you\u2019re usually closed up in your estate. You probably don\u2019t know that that unfilial grandson of mine has already left to join the army at the northern border.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shock appeared on Lady Pan\u2019s face, and she quickly tried to apologise. \u201cMatriarch He, it was my bad for that slip of the tongue. I hope you don\u2019t blame me. Who could have expected He Sanlang to be so resolute in leaving? Unless\u2026\u201d Her gaze shot towards Chu Lian, leaving the nonverbal accusation to hang in the air. It was clear by her actions that Lady Pan harboured some bad intentions towards them.</p><br/><p>Since their parties had been conversing for quite awhile, some of the madams were starting to shoot casual glances in their direction. Although nothing showed on their faces, their ears were keenly tuned to the slightest inflection as they tried to catch every word of Matriarch He and Lady Pan\u2019s conversation. Their eyes shone like vultures\u2019, seeking to scavenge some gossip.</p><br/><p>Lady Pan was trying to put the blame for He Changdi\u2019s leaving on this newlywed wife of his. Although she hadn\u2019t finished her sentence, anyone with a brain could tell what she was trying to get at.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou lowered her head. Although Lady Pan was provoking House Jing\u2019an right now, she didn\u2019t feel anger at all. Actually, it was the complete opposite- she felt delighted!</p><br/><p>Lady Pan happened to cross gazes with Chu Lian and was abruptly stunned by what she saw. Chu Lian\u2019s wide, clear eyes were looking right back at her without any hint of anger, as if she wasn\u2019t the subject of her provocation at all. What Lady Pan had done was akin to tossing a bucket of icy water into a bamboo basket. The icy water didn\u2019t affected the basket one bit, and had actually slipped through the seams like the basket was no more than a sieve, making Lady Pan feel like she had failed to do any damage at all.</p><br/><p>The two-faced Lady Pan hadn\u2019t made Chu Lian angry, but had conversely suffered some frustration herself. She stared at Chu Lian as she continued to say, \u201cNow that He Sanlang has joined the army at the northern border, if he doesn\u2019t accrue some sort of achievement, he\u2019ll only be able to return in five years. What a waste of Honoured Lady Jinyi\u2019s best years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian found all this rather funny. What was going on? Why was everyone targeting her? This was the first time she had ever met Lady Pan. The Pan Estate was also ranks above her, so she couldn\u2019t have possibly encountered them before marriage either. Why was Lady Pan suddenly at odds with her?</p><br/><p>Could it be because of Chu Qizheng\u2019s visit to the Pan Estate?</p><br/><p>When she thought of this, Chu Lian\u2019s expression turned dark.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t ask for her father\u2019s love, but he shouldn\u2019t be dragging her down, either!</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for Lady Pan\u2019s kind thoughts. My husband is extremely fortunate, so he\u2019ll surely have a lucky turn of events.\u201d Chu Lian threw her neutral reply back at Lady Pan. She was too lazy to beat around the bush with this Lady Pan and couldn\u2019t be bothered to form a more politically correct response. That Lady Pan was already trying to bully her, wasn\u2019t she allowed to throw something back?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wasn\u2019t someone who liked to hold grudges. She would rather give as good as she got on the spot.</p><br/><p>Lady Pan choked on that response. That everlasting smile on her face also slowly disappeared. She tossed one last cold sentence at Chu Lian. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Honoured Lady Jinyi to be so open-minded!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tilted her head to one side and gave a dazzlingly bright smile to Lady Pan.</p><br/><p>Lady Pan\u2019s tempo had been completely messed up by Chu Lian\u2019s unexpected reply. She suddenly gave a furtive smile. \u201cMatriarch He, I haven\u2019t seen your estate\u2019s round cakes. What\u2019s going on? Are you trying to deceive the Empress Dowager?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He sent a look at Chu Lian, who held up an exquisite container and showed it off to Lady Pan. \u201cThank you for reminding me of the round cakes, Lady Pan. I have to present them now, please excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said so, Chu Lian took the round cakes and her maidservants with her to greet the Empress Dowager.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

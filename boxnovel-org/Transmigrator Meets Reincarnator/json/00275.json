Are you really going to Liangzhou? I heard my big brother say that you can\u2019t even stick out your hands over there, or else they\u2019ll freeze!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s tightly furrowed brows. Her eyes were full of worry.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled. \u201cPrincess, the matriarch has already requested this from the Empress Dowager. I have to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia immediately stood up, indignant. \u201cHow can that old woman force you like that? Just tell me now! If you really don\u2019t want to go, this princess will go and plead with Grandmother- the Empress Dowager right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hurriedly tugged the agitated Royal Princess Duanjia back down. She held onto the princess\u2019s arm and shook it. \u201cPrincess, it\u2019s not like that, I wanted to go myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!! Chu Liu! You\u2019re trying to anger me to death!!\u201d Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s chest heaved up and down in her frustration. Finally, she turned her head and refused to pay attention to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was at a loss for what to do. She could only try to patiently explain her rationale. \u201cPrincess, He Sanlang is facing danger in the north. Our family can\u2019t just sit back and do nothing. Eldest Brother can\u2019t leave the capital and Second Brother is away in the next city on imperial business. The only one who can leave the estate is me! Also, if I\u2019m the one to go, we won\u2019t alert the enemy. We might even be able to snatch a victory if an opportunity comes along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia rolled her eyes without any consideration for Chu Lian\u2019s feelings. \u201cChu Liu, you don\u2019t even know a single martial arts move. What can you do if you go there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t intend to hide anything from Royal Princess Duanjia. She admitted, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know what I can do. But if I don\u2019t go and something happens to He Sanlang, I won\u2019t be able to live with myself.\u201d Looking at Matriarch He and Eldest Brother\u2019s preparations, they weren\u2019t hoping for any miracles from her. She was just meant to be a cover for the He Family to send resources to save Sanlang.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia knew that she couldn\u2019t convince Chu Lian, so she stomped hard on the floor. Full of dissatisfaction, she said, \u201cWhat did that He Sanlang do in his previous life to marry a wife like you?! Did he save the country or something? If I had met you earlier, I would have gotten my brother to marry you so you could be my sister-in-law!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian heard Royal Princess Duanjia speak so carelessly, the corners of her mouth twitched. This princess was really daring in her choice of words.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you unhappy because I\u2019m dissing He Sanlang? He\u2019s a good-for-nothing in the first place. What are you defending him for? See, that title of yours had nothing to do with him!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Royal Princess Duanjia wanted to insult people, she went all the way.</p><br/><p>Luckily, He Changdi wasn\u2019t here. Otherwise, he might have choked on his anger and died!</p><br/><p>When the princess saw that Chu Lian hadn\u2019t answered her and was just looking down and sipping her honey water, Royal Princess Duanjia suddenly sucked in her breath. She moved closer to Chu Lian and said, \u201cChu Liu, have you really fallen in love with that He Sanlang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was speechless. She didn\u2019t understand how Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s mind could leap to conclusions like that. Why was she suddenly asking about the feelings between her and her husband?</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian only looked up and blinked at her, Royal Princess Duanjia became more anxious, \u201cChu Liu! How could you be so silly! Are you made of putty?! That stupid man abandoned you five days into your marriage, but you\u2019ve actually set your heart on going to the northern border to save him from danger. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t even care if he lived or not! It would be best if he just died; this princess can still take another husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian almost spit out the honey water in her mouth thanks to Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s outrageous words.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t ignore Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s complaints and replied frankly, \u201cI\u2019m not going to the northern border just for He Sanlang. It\u2019s more for the sake of House Jing\u2019an, since I\u2019m the Third Young Madam of House Jing\u2019an first and foremost. As long as House Jing\u2019an is doing well, I\u2019ll be able to live my days well, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only when Royal Princess Duanjia heard Chu Lian\u2019s reply that she turned quiet.</p><br/><p>She stopped refuting Chu Lian and remained silent for a moment. Finally, she looked up and met Chu Lian\u2019s eyes. \u201cChu Liu, you have to be careful when you go to the northern border. I\u2019ll ask my father to send some guards to protect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled. \u201cPrincess, it\u2019s not as dangerous as you think. I\u2019m not going to the army camp, so why would anything happen to me? At most, I\u2019ll be staying in Liangzhou City for a while. Oh yes, didn\u2019t you say you wanted to eat hotpot some time ago? Why don\u2019t we eat hotpot together today since we have the chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although saliva had already began to pool in her mouth, Royal Princess Duanjia still rolled her eyes at Chu Lian. She complained, \u201cChu Liu, you\u2019re still thinking about food at this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian made a \u2018pfft\u2019 sound. \u201cSo~ Princess doesn\u2019t want to eat hotpot? Then I\u2019ll tell Xiyan and the rest to stop preparing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Chu Lian was about to stand up and do exactly that, Royal Princess Duanjia tugged on her sleeve and said, \u201cChu\u2026 Chu Liu\u2026 Since you want to eat hotpot, then this princess will do you a favour and accompany you for a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian covered her smile and shot a look at Royal Princess Duanjia.</p><br/><p>As expected, once food was mentioned, Royal Princess Duanjia had been successfully distracted. In an instant, she had already started to ask more questions: How was hotpot made? Could they really put all sorts of food in to cook? Would it still taste good that way?</p><br/><p>After the meal, Princess Wei grasped Chu Lian\u2019s hand and nagged at her for a long time. It wasn\u2019t until after 2pm that Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia finally went home in a low-key manner.</p><br/><p>The situation in the north could change at any moment, so House Jing\u2019an didn\u2019t dare to tarry. They quickly set the date for Chu Lian\u2019s departure to the north.</p><br/><p>Very coincidentally, it happened to be the day of Xiao Bojian\u2019s appreciation banquet in the Ying Estate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

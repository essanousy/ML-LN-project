He said that Third Young Master is being delayed by some matters, so he\u2019ll come by a little later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded and turned back around without asking more.</p><br/><p>The older cousin beside her had been trying to eavesdrop with her ears pricked, so her whispers to Wenqing had been overheard. The round-faced and slightly chubby cousin raised one brow, \u201cSixth Sister, you\u2019re already missing Marquis Anyuan when you\u2019ve only just come back to your maiden home? What a loving couple, you really make us all envious.\u201d</p><br/><p>A furrow developed between Chu Lian\u2019s brows. There was an obvious trace of jealousy and dissatisfaction within this unfamiliar cousin\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Even Wenqing and Wenlan couldn\u2019t help but frown when they heard her words.</p><br/><p>Right when Chu Lian was being distracted by this older cousin, someone bumped into her, causing her to lose her balance. Almost at the same time, she felt something hot on her shoulder.</p><br/><p>Teacups fell to the floor with a clatter, accompanied by a brief cry an instant later.</p><br/><p>When she turned around with a frown, she was met with the sight of a trembling maidservant prone on the ground and wailing constant apologies to her.</p><br/><p>Wenlan\u2019s face was full of fury as she set her eyes on the maidservant kneeling on the ground before them. She was using all of her willpower to refrain from shouting at the maidservant.</p><br/><p>Wenqing\u2019s brow furrowed as she held up Chu Lian\u2019s sleeve, \u201cThird Young Madam, your dress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian turned to look at her shoulder. A weird stain was spreading over the exquisite bamboo green fabric, which made it appear rather disconcerting.</p><br/><p>It was a cup of sencha that had been spilled on Chu Lian just now. The sencha of the Great Wu Dynasty consisted of various spices. The strange mixture was much more difficult to clean, compared to most stains. Furthermore, there was a strange odour that was unbearable to the senses.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at her stained sleeve for a few seconds. The maidservant who had bumped into her with the sencha earlier continued to kowtow and apologise. Chu Lian waved her hand to dismiss the maidservant. Even though she had already tried her best to be as low-key as possible, the commotion at their table had still attracted the attention of others.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s stepmother, Second Madam, rushed over.</p><br/><p>Her expression didn\u2019t look too good. She immediately berated the troublemaking maidservant the moment she arrived and ordered two senior servants to drag the culprit away.</p><br/><p>Once that was taken care of, she finally walked up to Chu Lian. When she saw the stain on her sleeve, she exclaimed, \u201cMiss Lian, you can\u2019t wear this dress anymore. Mother will arrange for you to change in a room nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian didn\u2019t like this stepmother of hers, she couldn\u2019t reject Second Madam under the watchful eyes of the crowd around her.</p><br/><p>She apologised to her cousins and excused herself from the table. She followed behind Second Madam with Wenlan and Wenqing in tow and left the banquet hall to change in another room.</p><br/><p>On the way there, Second Madam was all smiles, \u201cMiss Lian, your figure is similar to Miss Yuan\u2019s. I\u2019ll take you to the room first and send someone to bring over a set of Miss Yuan\u2019s clothes. Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to spend any more time with Second Madam than she absolutely had to. Miss Su had given her a warning earlier, so she was already inwardly taking precautions against the second branch of House Ying.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded her head. Second Madam smiled when she saw that she hadn\u2019t rejected the offer.</p><br/><p>Second Madam was certainly good at acting. Those not in the know would surely believe that she was Chu Lian\u2019s birth mother!</p><br/><p>She led Chu Lian to a quiet room nearby, then turned around to order the handmaid behind her to fetch the change of clothes. She immediately put on an apologetic expression while saying, \u201cMiss Lian, I can\u2019t leave the outer court for too long. I\u2019ll have to leave you here by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian showed a light smile, \u201cMother, go ahead. I\u2019ll have my maidservants here with me, so there won\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Madam kindly patted Chu Lian\u2019s hand before turning around to leave.</p><br/><p>After confirming that Second Madam had really left, Chu Lian immediately stood up.</p><br/><p>Wenqing was puzzled by her sudden action, \u201cThird Young Madam, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Resolution shone in Chu Lian\u2019s gaze, \u201cWe\u2019re leaving right now and returning to the estate!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

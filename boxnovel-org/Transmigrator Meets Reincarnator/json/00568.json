Even the experienced Senior Servant Zhong, who was on duty in the side room, couldn\u2019t help blushing over the noises she heard.</p><br/><p>The next day, Chu Lian slept in until the sun was high in the sky.</p><br/><p>She turned to one side without thinking and was suddenly re-acquainted with all the sore parts of her body, especially her waist\u2026</p><br/><p>When her eyes flickered open and her mind started to wake, the scenes from last night played in her head one by one.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s face turned bright red and she hugged the warm blankets to herself as she beat the bed with her fists. Regret washed over her in waves.</p><br/><p>How could He Changdi do that! He had actually hid the truth from her! No wonder she had felt that something was strange with her body these few days. She even thought that He Sanlang had become a herbivore, but he was actually a sheep in wolf\u2019s clothing!</p><br/><p>Thinking of the nourishing tonic she had readily drunk over the past few days, Chu Lian felt that she was a lamb being fattened for slaughter.</p><br/><p>The crazy passion they had shared last night made Chu Lian wish she could spontaneously erase all her memories. Where did He Changdi learn all those shameful poses\u2026</p><br/><p>She pulled the covers over her face and hid like an ostrich with its head in the sand.</p><br/><p>However, the sounds of footsteps outside the bedchamber made her get up again.</p><br/><p>She took in a deep breath and rubbed at her warm cheeks. When she felt calm again, she asked, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenlan was standing by the bed. When she heard the question, she immediately replied, \u201cThird Young Madam, it\u2019s almost the eleventh hour of the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stiffened up. She threw back the blankets and leapt up in a single instant.</p><br/><p>Wenlan quickly added on after hearing the noises, \u201cThird Young Madam, please don\u2019t worry. Third Young Master has already informed the matriarch and the countess before he left this morning. You don\u2019t have to greet them today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blinked and let out her anxiety in a single breath. Although her relations with the matriarch had already soured, she still had to do what was required as a junior member of the family. If she was lacking in her etiquette, it would reflect badly on her instead. Luckily, He Changdi had already taken care of that for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Master went to the Ministry of War and he said he would return in the afternoon. Would you like to get up now, Third Young Madam?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian lifted the bed curtains and told Wenlan to bring her clothes.</p><br/><p>When she finished washing up and sat at the table for breakfast, she seemed to have the strange feeling that the servants were looking at her with knowing expressions, coupled with teasing glints.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t sit still. It felt like she had done something wrong.</p><br/><p>After she was done with breakfast, Countess Jing\u2019an even specially came over to Songtao Court to visit her with a bowl of soup\u2026</p><br/><p>The obvious intentions of her mother-in-law gave Chu Lian the urge to pummel He Changdi to get rid of all the embarrassment welling up within her.</p><br/><p>However, she was still happy to see that Countess Jing\u2019an had become well enough to visit her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, do you feel any discomfort in your body now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since her health had improved, her mood had never been better.</p><br/><p>The current Countess Jing\u2019an had filled out a little. Her cheeks were now rosy with the pink of health.</p><br/><p>The countess shook her head with a smile, \u201cNot at all, I\u2019m perfectly healthy. I can eat well and sleep well. I never dared to dream of recovering my body to this state before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an had spent many years bedridden still. Even though the root of her illness had been cured, she was still a little more fragile than most. She would have to be careful not to expend too much energy in the future. However, compared to her condition a few months ago, this was a vast improvement.</p><br/><p>She was already very content with what she had now. She had been expecting to spend the rest of her life in bed before this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

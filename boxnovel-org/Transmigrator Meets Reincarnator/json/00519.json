The way she had put it was that the matriarch was dissatisfied with their branch of the family? How could the matriarch be dissatisfied with the third branch? He Sanlang was her most accomplished grandson, and she was probably more fond of him than his brothers! There was no way she\u2019d be dissatisfied with him, so Matriarch He was obviously only dissatisfied with just her alone.</p><br/><p>People often said that it was hard to be a wife and marry into someone else\u2019s family. Chu Lian hadn\u2019t felt that way at all in House Jing\u2019an previously, but now she was experiencing exactly what the saying meant for herself.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian grinned. She was very grateful that her mother-in-law cared about her enough to give her such advice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mother, I\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an spoke a few more lines of advice before letting Chu Lian go off.</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later, Chu Lian arrived at Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>While walking down a corridor, she bumped into Senior Servant Liu who had just came out of the warm parlour.</p><br/><p>When Senior Servant Liu noticed Chu Lian, she hastily stepped forward to welcome her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Madam,\u201d Senior Servant Liu had already greeted her although she was still some distance away.</p><br/><p>While Senior Servant Liu had a smile on her face, it didn\u2019t reach her eyes.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian suddenly figured out that there was something else going on.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Momo</i>, where are you heading to?</p><br/><p>While Chu Lian was speaking, Senior Servant Liu took the chance to raise her hand and make a gesture while everyone else was focusing on Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s expression froze before turning into a smile, \u201cSince <i>momo</i> is busy, don\u2019t let me hold you back. I\u2019ll go pay my respects to Grandmother now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant knew that Chu Lian had understood from the look in her eyes. She nodded, curtseyed towards Chu Lian, and quickly walked out of the bounds of Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian paused in her tracks for a moment. Senior Servant Liu had made a gesture indicating the act of \u2018drinking wine\u2019. This obviously referred to a place where wine was served\u2013 a restaurant. The only restaurant that could be related to her was Guilin Restaurant.</p><br/><p>Just as Senior Servant Zhong had said, the matriarch had probably set her heart on taking Guilin Restaurant back.</p><br/><p>The signal from Senior Servant Liu was likely a warning that the matriarch was going to mention this matter to her today.</p><br/><p>This was out of Chu Lian\u2019s expectations; she hadn\u2019t thought that they would become so impatient as to actually snatch \u2018food\u2019 right off her plate. What a complete lack of table manners.</p><br/><p>Before Chu Lian even entered the heated room, a servant had already scurried in to report her arrival.</p><br/><p>Her aunt-in-law, He Ying, was in the room. She gave a little cough, glanced at Matriarch He, and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, it won\u2019t be too good if you speak later. Let me take the burden off your hands and be the bad person.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch thought about it for a moment before nodding.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was led into the warm room by a maidservant.</p><br/><p>She then greeted them both as a junior family member.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was seated in the middle with Muxiang behind her, earnestly massaging the matriarch\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, there are no strangers here. Have a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The edges of Chu Lian\u2019s mouth curved upwards. After thanking the matriarch for her kindness, she took an empty seat on the matriarch\u2019s right side.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas Sanlang come back yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy husband mentioned that he would be having dinner outside and that he\u2019ll be home late tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Matriarch He asked a few more superficial questions, clearly trying to make some small talk, before falling silent.</p><br/><p>Eldest Madam He Ying was getting a little impatient. She gauged the matriarch\u2019s mood from her expression first, before her eyes darted from side to side. She interrupted the conversation as if she had just thought of something, \u201cMother, if I remember correctly, your birthday is coming soon. Are we going to hold a large celebration this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glanced at her aunt-in-law with her eyebrows raised slightly. While her lips were obviously raised into a smile, He Ying had a weird feeling as if Chu Lian had already seen through her motives long before she had even mentioned it.</p><br/><p>The matriarch showed a bitter smile in response to the question, \u201cDalang\u2019s recent divorce hasn\u2019t reflected well on our house. Let\u2019s forget about celebrating my birthday this year, it\u2019s not a major milestone anyway. When the time comes, we can just have a nice reunion dinner with family. Besides, our estate is lacking in funds now, it\u2019s better if we save more.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying let out a startled expression, \u201cMother, how can that do? Even if we\u2019re low on funds, we\u2019d rather save more from our daily spending than just let your birthday pass without a proper celebration! Don\u2019t you agree, Sanlang\u2019s wife!?\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint smile hung on Chu Lian\u2019s face, but she didn\u2019t answer her aunt-in-law\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s indifference and refusal to take the bait made He Ying extremely vexed.</p><br/><p>A new idea sparked in He Ying\u2019s mind and she changed strategies, \u201cMother, how about this? Tell me how much our estate needs. If the amount is within my capabilities, I\u2019ll help to make up for it, alright? No matter what, you must be able to have a proper birthday celebration.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying shot Muxiang a look while speaking.</p><br/><p>Muxiang looked at the matriarch awkwardly, and the matriarch helplessly glared at He Ying.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ying, do you really think your mother is that useless? To actually need your contributions? Let me tell you frankly, our estate is indeed severely lacking in funds. A large part of it is due to Madam Zou, but we\u2019re not in as dire a state as you think. Besides, we still have Sanlang\u2019s wife\u2019s Guilin Restaurant helping to keep us afloat. Once Guilin Restaurant reopens, we\u2019ll be able to survive this period of hardship just fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was laughing inside. After the many twists and turns, they had finally moved on to the main topic. It had truly been tough on this mother-daughter pair.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

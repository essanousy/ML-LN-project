I\u2019ll tell Senior Servant Lan what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know of the underlying reasons for her visit, she was genuinely concerned for Princess Wei\u2019s health.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao stroked his long, white beard with a spark of understanding in his eyes.</p><br/><p>His decades of experience meant that he could see through certain things. Although he had realised what was going on the moment he read Princess Wei\u2019s pulse, the sharp Great Doctor Miao didn\u2019t expose their excuse and simply followed along with what Princess Wei wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, don\u2019t worry. You still have to worry about your own health first, with that little one in your belly! Have the symptoms gotten better this month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled and nodded, \u201cI can eat whatever I want now without any nausea!\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Wei returned the smile and stroked her head.</p><br/><p>While the atmosphere in the room was warm, Senior Servant Lan suddenly rushed into the room with a terrible expression.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei frowned at the sight, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Lan glanced at Chu Lian, then Royal Princess Duanjia. In the end, she could only lean close to Princess Wei and whisper something into her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The originally kind expression on Princess Wei\u2019s face fell away and absolute shock replaced it in an instant. The fact that she hadn\u2019t been able to conceal the change spoke to the gravity of the news.</p><br/><p>It was very rare that Princess Wei would act this way. Even Royal Princess Duanjia had never seen her mother lose her composure like this before.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia asked urgently, \u201cMother, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stood up along with Royal Princess Duanjia. She pressed her lips without speaking and looked seriously at Princess Wei.</p><br/><p>With a subtle nudge from Senior Servant Lan, Princess Wei suddenly came back to her senses.</p><br/><p>She abruptly looked towards Great Doctor Miao, who was sitting at one side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, I have a request that I hope you might accept.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Wei spoke very humbly. She didn\u2019t even refer to her status while speaking.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao was first startled for a moment, before he replied, \u201cIf Your Highness has some request, please feel free to speak. If it is within my means to help, I won\u2019t stand by idly.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Great Doctor Miao did have some arrogance that came with his age, he wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><br/><p>He knew of Princess Wei\u2019s status. Someone who could make her this worried, worried enough to humble herself, was likely someone of equally high status. Although he didn\u2019t care about fame, he knew that there were some people he couldn\u2019t afford to offend if he wanted to continue living peacefully. Princess Wei just so happened to be one of those.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it would likely be in line with his strengths, so there shouldn\u2019t be much difficulty in her request.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei was an upright character and she wouldn\u2019t make unreasonable demands.</p><br/><p>Soon, the princess personally lead Great Doctor Miao to a room that was under heavy guard.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was left under the care of Royal Princess Duanjia, and even Senior Servant Lan wasn\u2019t allowed to follow them.</p><br/><p>Within the heavily guarded room, Prince and Princess Wei stood by the bedside while two men stood not too far away.</p><br/><p>One of them was a clean-shaven man who looked to be in his fifties, while the other man was much younger.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao only managed a glance at them before a chill ran down his spine. His gaze moved to the middle-aged man in steel grey robes lying on the bed.</p><br/><p>The doctor suppressed the turbulent emotions in his heart by shutting his eyes and letting his mind calm down.</p><br/><p>He was invited to sit by the bed by Prince Wei.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t ask any questions and simply started taking the pulse of the middle-aged man according to Prince Wei\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>After fifteen minutes or so had passed, Great Doctor Miao was done with his diagnosis.</p><br/><p>He looked back at the middle-aged man on the bed before looking up at Prince Wei. While time has left its mark on the mysterious man\u2019s face, it was clear that Prince Wei and the man were closely related.</p><br/><p>The two of them had very similar features.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao was deliberating on what to say. His brow was already furrowed from tension.</p><br/><p>After mulling it over, he decided to tell the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, would it be possible to speak elsewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Wei was slightly surprised. He hadn\u2019t thought that the doctor would make such a request.</p><br/><p>He looked over the other people present in the room with caution. After a few seconds of thought, he agreed to Great Doctor Miao\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, please follow this prince this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them entered a quieter room. Prince Wei set his personal bodyguards at the entrance, so no one would dare to approach.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao took a deep breath before speaking resolutely, \u201cThe patient has been poisoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Prince Wei couldn\u2019t maintain his composure at this point. His eyes were wide with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?! He\u2019s been poisoned? How could that be possible?!\u201d</p><br/><p>His brother was the ruler of the land under heaven, the regent of their kingdom. There were many talents gathered under his court. How could he possibly be poisoned?!</p><br/><p>Since Great Doctor Miao had decided to speak the truth, he had also considered Prince Wei\u2019s emotional outburst.</p><br/><p>He first waited for Prince Wei to calm down before explaining everything to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a slow-acting poison. This old doctor can\u2019t tell which poison it is until further examination. However, this old doctor can confirm that it isn\u2019t a common poison and that it hasn\u2019t spread throughout the patient\u2019s body yet. There is still a chance for treatment at this point. If treatment is delayed any longer, the patient will be beyond saving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Wei had already been through great turmoil in his life. During the fight for the throne, where they had battled against their brothers, he and the emperor had carved out a bloody road for themselves. As grave as it was, could any other matter compare to the perilous situation they had been in back then? He quickly calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow confident are you that you will be able to treat the patient?\u201d</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao was silent in thought for a moment before he lifted seven fingers, \u201cSeventy percent. With the right ingredients, it could be as high as eighty percent.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

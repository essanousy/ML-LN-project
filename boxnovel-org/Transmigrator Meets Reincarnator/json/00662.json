I only had some normal nourishing soup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that Chu Lian had fallen off her horse, Great Doctor Miao\u2019s eyes widened as far as they could go. However, after hearing that she hadn\u2019t taken any medicine, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Those sly imperial physicians! The old foxes must have suspected that Chu Lian was pregnant, but they likely hadn\u2019t been able to diagnose it properly, so they must have avoided prescribing any medicine for their own safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you! Are seriously muddle-headed!\u201d Great Doctor Miao pointed a shaking finger at the couple in his anger.</p><br/><p>He turned to look at the servants standing behind Chu Lian and He Changdi and lamented, \u201cAh\u2026 What a useless group of people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was shocked by Great Doctor Miao\u2019s sudden change in mood. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Faced by all the dazed and confused faces around him, Great Doctor Miao just couldn\u2019t keep his temper up. He stopped beating around the bush and stated, \u201cLian\u2019er is already one month pregnant! Thank your lucky stars! If you continue being so clumsy, you might have lost the child!\u201d</p><br/><p>What?!</p><br/><p>The sudden announcement from Great Doctor Miao made everyone dumbfounded and lost for words.</p><br/><p>The most exaggerated reaction came from He Changdi.</p><br/><p>He completely lost his usual cool and stiff facade as a myriad of emotions blossomed into life on his face.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was stiff with shock. She looked down dazedly at her flat abdomen. So there was already a new life growing in there without her knowing! She subconsciously reached out to stroke her abdomen. Even if she couldn\u2019t feel any change, Chu Lian still thought that something was different.</p><br/><p>He Changdi turned to stare at Chu Lian. There were too many emotions in his eyes to name, but slowly, joy surfaced up and shone in his gaze.</p><br/><p>He pulled Chu Lian into his embrace without caring for their audience, hugging Chu Lian around her narrow waist and stroking Chu Lian\u2019s smooth hair tenderly.</p><br/><p>He mumbled, \u201cLian\u2019er, we\u2026 we have a child!\u201d</p><br/><p>In his past life, He Changdi had never consummated his marriage with \u2018Chu Lian\u2019. Later on, when House Jing\u2019an had fallen and he had been exiled, his very survival had been a problem out in the bitter north. With revenge on his mind, he hadn\u2019t had the time to consider relationships with women.</p><br/><p>Thus, this child was his very first. Now that he was going to become a father for the first time, and the person who was going to bear the next generation for him was a woman he deeply loved, the last bits of ice locking his heart fully melted away.</p><br/><p>The servants, Senior Servant Zhong and Xiyan included amongst them, finally reacted to the news. Joy shone from all of their faces; Senior Servant Zhong\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t even be seen from how widely she was beaming.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao harrumphed, \u201cDon\u2019t get too happy yet! Tell me, did you hear what I just said?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi and Chu Lian\u2019s hearts thumped in unison.</p><br/><p>There was extreme worry in He Changdi\u2019s expression, \u201cUncle Miao, how is Lian\u2019er\u2019s body now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked up at Great Doctor Miao with uncertainty on her face. This was her first ever child as well. She wanted to protect her child with all her might. The little sprout was the product of the love between her and He Changdi, a living testament to the depth of their feelings and promise to each other.</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao was pretty helpless in the face of their worry. He could only try to empathise with them since they were going to be parents for the first time. He explained everything to them in detail patiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I can tell, the foetus is in a stable condition. However, don\u2019t be so rash as you were last time! Lian\u2019er\u2019s body isn\u2019t in the best of health now. Before the pregnancy is stable, stay in the estate and be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Great Doctor Miao\u2019s words were like an imperial decree, from the way everyone present was listening intently.</p><br/><p>Before Great Doctor Miao left, he specially called out to He Changdi.</p><br/><p>\u201cZixiang, come with me. I have some instructions for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t dare to tarry and quickly followed after Great Doctor Miao out of the room.</p><br/><p>Now it was only Chu Lian and her servants left in the parlour. When she looked up and around the circle of servants, all she could see was happiness and elation on their faces. The corners of her mouth couldn\u2019t help lifting in a smile.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong stood at the lead of the group of maidservants as they bobbed in respect towards Chu Lian in unison. The old servant\u2019s eyes were still upturned crescents as she said, \u201cCongratulations, Third Young Madam! Our estate is about to have a new heir!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in this era tended to favour males more, so Chu Lian didn\u2019t correct the senior servant\u2019s words. She simply smiled again and told them to stand.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian stood up, wanting to return to her bedroom to change, Xiyan immediately rushed over to support her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at her action. She glared at Xiyan. Why did she feel that she had suddenly become someone who couldn\u2019t even walk properly in the eyes of her servants? The \u2018child\u2019 in her belly was likely only a fertilised egg at this point\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShoo, I can walk by myself. You\u2019re making a mountain out of a molehill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan wasn\u2019t willing to budge and insisted on holding her, so Chu Lian let her be.</p><br/><p>Once they entered the bedroom, just as she was about to lie down on the chaise by the bed, Senior Servant Zhong ordered all the maidservants in the room to leave.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian found it strange. She gaped a little at Senior Servant Zhong\u2019s sudden actions, \u201cMomo, what is it? Do you have something to say to me in private?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong had some knowledge of medicine and midwifery. While she had been away at the rural holdings of House Jing\u2019an, she had helped quite a few pregnant women deliver their children. She was a very capable person.</p><br/><p>He Changdi respected her, so Chu Lian also viewed her as half a senior family member.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong walked over to Chu Lian and sat down in front of her. She took Chu Lian\u2019s hand in her own and smiled, \u201cThird Young Madam, this old servant will ask someone to clear out the side room and move Third Young Master\u2019s daily necessities over.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

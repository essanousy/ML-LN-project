Nothing good ever happened each time she met Prince Jin. He hadn\u2019t left a shred of mercy in his words for her. Didn\u2019t he know that women hated being called fat?!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was the frail-looking and thin type of beauty that was favoured in the Great Wu Dynasty.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian managed to squeeze out an awkward smile for Prince Jin before introducing Sima Hui to him.</p><br/><p>Sima Hui had a straightforward and brave air to her because she spent so much time in the army. She had traded the reserve that most noble ladies had for an easygoing and dignified attitude.</p><br/><p>Somehow, the fourth prince who rarely interacted with unfamiliar ladies got along with her rather well.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian followed behind them while holding the reins of her mare, looking at their backs with the spark of an idea forming.</p><br/><p>The author of the original story had only mentioned Sima Hui in a single line. From what she knew, the fourth prince had never even met Sima Hui before. However, the two of them seemed like old friends right now.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s almond-shaped eyes were sparkling bright now. Even her lips had tilted upwards in a curve.</p><br/><p>Just as she was immersed in her thoughts, her horse suddenly changed directions and tried to head towards the side of the road, giving her a fright. When she quickly turned to look, she realised that it was all He Sanlang\u2019s doing.</p><br/><p>She complained, \u201cHe Changdi! What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang turned to her with a faint smile as he continued leading her horse away. \u201cTeaching you to ride.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian cried out in alarm as the gentle mare under her suddenly started galloping. Her face turned pale from fright. Just as she felt as if she were going to fall off the horse, something tightened around her waist and pulled her up into the air. When she finally regained her senses, she was already sitting on He Changdi\u2019s mount.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was still in a panicked state. She gripped tightly onto He Sanlang\u2019s narrow waist once she was ensconced in his embrace.</p><br/><p>Despite having only one hand on the reins and one arm around Chu Lian, He Changdi was at ease even as his steed was galloping freely.</p><br/><p>As they travelled under the clear sky, there was a warm and genial smile on He Sanlang\u2019s face that had never been seen before even in his past life.</p><br/><p>Once Chu Lian had recovered her breath, she pinched his arm forcefully in anger.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s eye twitched in pain. He lowered his gaze helplessly, \u201cChu Lian, if you continue pinching me that hard, I\u2019ll lose my grip on the reins and we\u2019ll really fall off the horse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glared at him fiercely, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to do that anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang looked down and placed a kiss on her smooth, flushed cheek. \u201cThen you can\u2019t let anyone else teach you how to ride next time. Only I\u2019m allowed to teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know how to ride now, so there\u2019s no need for you to teach me.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to ride a horse. The hard part was getting used to the bumpy ride.</p><br/><p>He Changdi raised an eyebrow in question, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve already learned how to ride?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian refused to give in, \u201cDidn\u2019t you watch me just now? I was riding that horse perfectly well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Chu Lian finished speaking, He Changdi urged his horse on with a low shout. The handsome steed responded by opening up its stride and flying into a gallop.</p><br/><p>The scenery on either side turned into a blur and the ride turned even more bumpy. Chu Lian was frightened by the sudden speed and clung tightly onto He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Somehow, she could still hear He Changdi\u2019s husky, magnetic voice by her ear, \u201cAre you still sure that you know how to ride a horse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had already realised that this fellow was purposely teasing her. Her cheeks were flushed red with anger as she exclaimed, \u201cHe Changdi! Why are you so childish!\u201d</p><br/><p>The only response she could hear through the winds blowing past was He Changdi\u2019s bright and open laughter, which she could feel through his shaking chest.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was startled. She couldn\u2019t help but look up at He Changdi\u2019s sharp jaw. Right now, he had lost all of the gloominess that had always been present on his face ever since she had met him.</p><br/><p>He was genuinely and truly living in this happy and warm moment now.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian suddenly had the urge to freeze time to keep him in his current state, freed of all his worries and burdens.</p><br/><p>She tightened her hold around him and buried her head into his chest. Having lost all desire to retort to him, she broke out into a whole-hearted smile.</p><br/><p>By the time the couple returned to the group, an hour had already passed.</p><br/><p>The fierce winds they had encountered on horseback had messed up their cloaks, so He Sanlang and Chu Lian both looked a little haggard. However, the messiness of their clothes couldn\u2019t hide the pure joy on their faces.</p><br/><p>He Changdi personally escorted Chu Lian to her carriage.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu eyed the two of them from not too far away with shining eyes. He tsked to himself and let out a chuckle with a wretched expression, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Brother He know how to control himself? We\u2019re still on the road here! He just took Sister-in-law out like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai had no idea what to say to the brat. He glared at him and threw a chestnut at his silly head, \u201cYou little brat. What are you thinking of in that head of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu held his wounded head in a pitiful manner and protested, \u201cBrother Zhang, you\u2019re not allowed to hit my head! My mother already thinks I\u2019m stupid enough. If you keep hitting my head, I won\u2019t be able to get a wife in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo burst out into raucous laughter while watching the two banter.</p><br/><p>The victory in the war against the Tuhuns had lifted the mood of their their long-suffering soldiers.</p><br/><p>They entered the capital on the second day of the second month of the lunar calendar, the day of the Longtaitou Festival.</p><br/><p>The Chengping Emperor had sent officials from the Ministry of Rites to welcome them five kilometres out from the capital.</p><br/><p>General Qian and his troops would have to change into special ceremonial armour and enter the capital under the lead of the officials armed with ceremonial weapons. They would then enter the palace for the official bestowal ceremony. This was the highest honour that could be given to a military official returning home.</p><br/><p>It was also due to this arrangement that Prince Jin and Chu Lian had to part ways with the border troops when they were close to the outskirts of the capital.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At least that man would show his sincerity through his actions, rather than just using meaningless words.</p><br/><p>She sneered inwardly. Did Xiao Bojian really think that those empty promises would melt her heart?</p><br/><p>That only showed how much he didn\u2019t understand her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Xiao, don\u2019t you know that you\u2019re causing trouble for me like this? Right now, I don\u2019t have any ties with you at all.\u201d Chu Lian lowered her head as she spoke, so that Xiao Bojian wouldn\u2019t see the annoyance and disgust in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian stiffened and looked around them with some anxiety.</p><br/><p>This place was foreign to him. This was the Jing\u2019an Estate, and the woman before him had the title of House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam.</p><br/><p>When his thoughts led him to this realisation, it was as if he had lost his soul. He felt as if thorns were piercing him right in his heart.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! How could he have forgotten that fact? Such a wonderful and perfect Lian\u2019er\u2026 didn\u2019t belong to him right now!</p><br/><p>The depths of his eyes turned cold in an instant, but the guilt in his heart only increased.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath and managed to calm down a little. He raised his gaze and stared at Chu Lian. \u201cLian\u2019er, I didn\u2019t think things through carefully enough. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get you out of this and give you a proper title as my wife! You\u2026 have to wait for me! It won\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shock flared up in Chu Lian\u2019s mind, but she didn\u2019t dare to display it on her face. She looked downwards without speaking, as if she was pretending to be angry at him.</p><br/><p>It was clear from Xiao Bojian\u2019s expression that he couldn\u2019t bear to part with her. However, he pressed his lips together and finally said, \u201cLian\u2019er, don\u2019t be angry with me. I\u2019m leaving now, we won\u2019t be discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he strode right out of the pavilion. When he stepped out, he paused before adding on, \u201cLian\u2019er, the meal you cooked today was delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the future, would you just cook for me alone? Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have the right to say that now.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Xiao Bojian was really feeling shame and remorse; he didn\u2019t even turn back to look at her again after leaving.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until Xiao Bojian\u2019s figure had completely disappeared from sight that Chu Lian dared to raise her head. Her remaining strength left her body and she collapsed on the spot.</p><br/><p>That was way too dangerous. If she hadn\u2019t discovered Xiao Bojian\u2019s guilt towards her in time, their meeting wouldn\u2019t have ended well for her.</p><br/><p>If that Xiao Bojian could act so fearlessly even in the Jing\u2019an Estate, it looked like just avoiding him wasn\u2019t going to work next time. She had to prepare some precautionary measures somehow.</p><br/><p>Sob sob. She really didn\u2019t like him at all! If she could pay a thousand taels to stop Xiao Bojian from liking her, she would have gritted her teeth and paid out the full amount! Why was she so unlucky?!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wiped her lips fiercely with a handkerchief until they were red and sore, before throwing the handkerchief to the ground in a temper.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s thin lips looked so soft, pink and weak\u2026 They were pretty much better-looking than hers. Wasn\u2019t his kiss the same as getting kissed by a woman??</p><br/><p>Chu Lian flipped a table in her mind! (\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t the type of person who dwelled on things. For the whole incident today, she just treated it as getting bitten by a passing stray dog. Thus, she managed to calm herself down and walked over to Xiyan to wake her up.</p><br/><p>When she took a look at the back of Xiyan\u2019s neck, there was a bruise, just like the previous time with Wenlan.</p><br/><p>After Xiyan woke up, she was completely panic-stricken. \u201cThird Young Madam, are you well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head and helped her up from the floor. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan looked Chu Lian up and down. When she saw that her master really seemed okay, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Her voice trembled as she asked, \u201cWas it Mister Xiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian knew that she couldn\u2019t hide this matter from Xiyan, so she nodded.</p><br/><p>Xiyan\u2019s cheeks immediately puffed up, shaking with anger as she said, \u201cHe\u2026. How dare he! This is the Jing\u2019an Estate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was also helpless. Xiao Bojian was indeed very bold. If she hadn\u2019t made use of his guilt towards her today, he probably wouldn\u2019t have left so quickly.</p><br/><p>When Xiyan noticed Chu Lian\u2019s silence, she quickly tried to reassure her. \u201cThird Young Madam, please don\u2019t worry too much. As long as we don\u2019t associate with him, he can\u2019t do anything to Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t be bothered to say any more on the matter. She had already lost the interest to nap by this time. She simply ordered listlessly, \u201cLet\u2019s return to our courtyard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan answered her and quickly followed behind Third Young Madam. However, she had already decided in her heart to send Wenqing and Wenlan with her master, no matter where she went.</p><br/><p>While full of suppressed emotion, Xiao Bojian quickly strode along. Since Xiao Bojian had left that pavilion, One had already come out of the shadows to follow behind his master. He kept a watchful eye on their surroundings as they left the inner court of the Jing\u2019an Estate. Along the way, he even knocked out two servants who had been passing through the gardens.</p><br/><p>No matter how skilled he was in martial arts, he couldn\u2019t make any careless mistakes while protecting his master.</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Bojian was passing through the door connecting the outer and inner courts, he was caught by someone\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou couldn\u2019t stop worrying when she wasn\u2019t serving by her husband\u2019s side. When she heard that her husband\u2019s friends had been sent to rest after getting drunk, she had gone to the outer court to check on the situation. However, on her way back to the inner court, she suddenly spotted a familiar figure.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s appearance was rather outstanding and would attract a second look from anyone, regardless of gender. No matter how much he tried to keep a low profile with his dressing and personality, he couldn\u2019t hide his extraordinary looks.</p><br/><p>TL Note: The author put the table flip emoji there, so I kept it in the text (\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/>\n</div>"}

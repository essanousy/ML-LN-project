When that happened, more than half of the snow-covered plains would turn into wetlands, which was just as dangerous as snow.</p><br/><p>Urihan and her sons now lived in the He Estate. After spending some time with them, Urihan was now able to speak the common language used in the Great Wu at a basic level. Although her intonation was a little strange, there was no problem in communicating with day-to-day matters.</p><br/><p>Having survived an arduous trial with Urihan and her sons, Chu Lian had a great relationship with them now. Urihan only had two sons and no daughters and Chu Lian was even younger than her eldest son Myeryen, so she doted on Chu Lian like her very own daughter.</p><br/><p>The barbarians were a straightforward people and weren\u2019t bound by complicated rules and etiquette like the nobles of the Great Wu Dynasty. As an honest young lady born in the modern world, Chu Lian found it easy to get along with Urihan. They acted more like long-lost relatives around each other.</p><br/><p>The health of the eleven-year-old Narisong had slowly improved after days of proper nutritious food and medicine in the He Estate. Now the two brothers were working under Manager Qin.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had already discussed the matter of Urihan and her sons with He Sanlang. They were going to bring the three along with them when they returned to the capital, and they would stay with them from now on.</p><br/><p>The usually \u2018narrow-minded\u2019 He Sanlang had generously agreed with Chu Lian\u2019s suggestion for this matter. This had caused Chu Lian to confirm it with him again as she wasn\u2019t sure if he had heard her clearly. Only then was she sure that he wasn\u2019t joking.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was seated beside He Changdi\u2019s bed with a bowl of medicine in hand. Finding her husband\u2019s sudden geniality strange, she asked, \u201cHe Changdi, when did you become so agreeable?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi shot a quick glance at her before he closed his eyes, hiding the flash of emotion in their depths. The changes in his mood couldn\u2019t be detected from his even tone, \u201cWhen have I ever been anything but agreeable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had been stirring the concoction in the bowl with a spoon. She rolled her eyes when she heard He Changdi\u2019s reply, \u201cWhen have you ever been agreeable? You get into a temper if I stay for just a moment longer with Sister Hui!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tips of He Changdi\u2019s ears reddened. He then pursed his lips and remained silent.</p><br/><p>During the time they had spent together in the past few days, they hadn\u2019t been glued to each other the whole time, but they had still shared the same bed and ate all three meals together everyday. Now, they were both more familiar with each other.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had always been sharp-witted, so she had a much better understanding of how socially awkward her husband was now.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had pursed his lips and maintained his silence probably meant that he had justified his own actions to himself a hundred times over.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mouth twitched. She wanted to stuff the bowl of medicine into his hands.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang intentionally stayed still, so Chu Lian could only come to a compromise. What could she do since he was still injured?</p><br/><p>She resigned herself to her fate, and lifted a spoonful of medicine to He Sanlang\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>It was only then that He Changdi finally opened his mouth to take the bitter medicine.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was speechless. She had tried tasting the medicine he was drinking out of curiosity before. It was bitter as hell! If she had the choice to, she wouldn\u2019t be able to take a single sip.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t it better to just gulp it all down considering how bitter it was? Why did he insist on her feeding him spoonful by spoonful? Could it be that He Sanlang had lost his sense of taste? He even looked so happy drinking it, what a weirdo.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian started discussing the matter at hand with him only after he had finished the last mouthful of medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going out later, and I\u2019ll probably only be able to return in the afternoon. The doctor will be coming to the estate later to prescribe more medicine, so let Laiyue attend to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had initially been in a good mood. However, his wife\u2019s words immediately made his mood take a turn for the worse.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much change in his expression, as he already had a cold and handsome face, but his eyes seemed to darken a little. His aura became so imposing that it would make others freeze up, but he didn\u2019t realize that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian knew that he was leaping to conclusions in his mind again, so she reassured him, \u201cGet Laiyue to follow me then. I\u2019ll have Wenqing and Uncle Mo stay behind to take care of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were husband and wife, so she didn\u2019t want to keep him in the dark regarding what she was doing. Thus, she might as well open up everything she was doing to his watch. If Laiyue followed along, He Sanlang would definitely trust what Laiyue reported about her doings.</p><br/><p>In the end, He Changdi agreed, but he didn\u2019t forget to remind her, \u201cBring more guards with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a laugh, Chu Lian suddenly kissed him on the cheek, then quickly made her escape.</p><br/><p>The sounds of her sweet bell-like laughter resounded in the room.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was stunned by Chu Lian\u2019s sudden kiss. It was only after she was long gone that he managed to regain his senses. His first reaction was to blush hard.</p><br/><p>Luckily, there was no one else in the room at this moment, otherwise they would have witnessed the poker-faced Third Young Master blushing after getting assaulted by Third Young Madam. The sight alone would likely shake them to their core and they might even worry that he had been possessed.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin had already prepared the snowboats for departure.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was helped up onto the snowboat by Wenlan. She and Wenlan shared the snowboat with Li Yue.</p><br/><p>Laiyue and Manager Qin sat in another.</p><br/><p>The places they were heading to today weren\u2019t too far away, it would only take about an hour to get to the closest one.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the first area, Chu Lian lifted the curtain in the carriage slightly to look at the six sturdy tents nearby.</p><br/><p>There were barbarians travelling to the tent from all directions from time to time.</p><br/><p>Most of the barbarians were herding yaks, horses and goats. There were also some who carried goat and yak skins. However, they all shared one common trait, which was their skinny bodies and haggard faces.</p><br/><p>Someone with experience would be able to tell that they had become like this because of their quality of life.</p><br/><p>It may not necessarily have been caused by a lack of food.</p><br/><p>There could be a few causes for their haggard appearances. Not eating salt for a long time, or an imbalance of nutrition due to only eating meat for extended periods of time. It may even be due to them lacking coal to provide them warmth.</p><br/><p>This small area with the six tents in the center was a simple market specially prepared for them to trade goods.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

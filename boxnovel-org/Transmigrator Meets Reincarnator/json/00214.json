I would like to ask for your forgiveness, and hope that you won\u2019t hold it against her for this dishonesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou didn\u2019t know that He Changqi had already told his friends about Chu Lian\u2019s cooking. However, Madam Zou had suddenly tried to steal Chu Lian\u2019s credit in front of He Changqi and his friends. Her plan had failed and she had shown that she didn\u2019t have the virtues that a good wife should have. Not only that, she had practically slapped He Changqi in the face in front of his good friends.</p><br/><p>Lord Ge quickly helped He Changqi back up. \u201cBrother He, please don\u2019t blame yourself. Everyone has some form of greed for fortune and fame. Sister-in-law simply wanted to impress us brothers for your sake. There\u2019s no reason for us to blame her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marquis Weiyuan smiled and agreed with Lord Ge\u2019s sentiment. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for us all to have the time to meet. There\u2019s a great feast before us, so let\u2019s not waste it. Come, come, let\u2019s eat and drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>After this whole turn of events, Madam Zou\u2019s lies had already been exposed. Although He Changqi\u2019s friends let it pass so as to help He Changqi keep his dignity, the same couldn\u2019t be said for their private thoughts.</p><br/><p>However, there was one point of similarity. Madam Zou\u2019s image had been utterly destroyed in front of them. Even Heir Zheng and Marquis Weiyuan were starting to pity He Changqi.</p><br/><p>Without speaking of how Madam Zou hadn\u2019t given He Changqi a male heir yet, just based on what they had seen of her personality today, it had completely changed how these few men thought of the ladies of the Dingyuan Estate.</p><br/><p>He Changqi had been expecting to impress his friends today. However, after Madam Zou\u2019s little play, He Changqi was so ashamed that he couldn\u2019t hold his head high amongst his friends.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the awkward atmosphere didn\u2019t last for long. When the men started tasting the food before them, they completely forgot about Madam Zou and her lies. All that remained in their minds was the delicious food on the table! Right here and right now, they couldn\u2019t let these delicacies go to waste!</p><br/><p>There was usually a refined and lofty air at these friendly meetings between noblemen. They would brew some tea, warm up some wine and maybe grill some venison with their good friends. If the mood was right, they might even compose a few poems or couplets with brushes in hand and wine cups in the other\u2026 Basically, it would be very elegant and dignified. Wolfing down their food and searching for seconds in the pot was something that unrefined barbarians would do. It was something that these noble and high-born gentlemen would never do.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Nobility, manners, elegance? Are those edible? Could those silly principles satisfy the hunger in their bellies?</p><br/><p>Of course not!</p><br/><p>Marquis Weiyuan and Lord Ge were childhood friends and had grown up together. When they had started studying, they had studied together in the Ge Family\u2019s private school for their own clan members. Their mothers were best friends, so the two kids had practically grown up wearing the same pair of pants. However, at this moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Marquis Weiyuan quickly finished off one of the sweet and sour pork ribs before staring at the remaining ribs on the plate. As he watched, Heir Zheng reached out and stole away one more rib, so there was one left on that blue porcelain plate. Marquis Weiyuan immediately sent his chopsticks flying towards that last pork rib on the plate, but sparks flew as he suddenly met with another pair of silver chopsticks on his way.</p><br/><p>Marquis Weiyuan\u2019s gaze traced the chopsticks back to their owner, only to see the normally composed Lord Ge with his cheeks bulging.</p><br/><p>His eye twitched and he quickly spoke up, \u201cBrother Ge, I touched it first, move your chopsticks away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Li, I\u2019m older than you by a year. When you were younger, I gave in to you all the time. This time, you should let your older brother have a turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Ge, your mouth is still full!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Marquis Weiyuan and Lord Ge, who were practically twins since birth, had suddenly started arguing over a single sweet and sour pork rib.</p><br/><p>He Changqi\u2019s awkwardness upon witnessing this scene didn\u2019t prevent him from continuously reaching out to grab some poached fish slices at all. It was good that they were arguing anyway. As a result, no one was fighting with him over this plate of fish. Although Third Sister-in-Law had sent over an entire bowl the last time, it hadn\u2019t been enough! Furthermore, he had a big appetite, so he hadn\u2019t eaten his fill yet. This time, perhaps due to consideration for the guests, Chu Lian had prepared a much larger portion. That soft, tender, white meat was paired with the fiery fragrance of chilli, yet it still melted in the mouth like butter. It was so tasty he even felt like swallowing his tongue along with it!</p><br/><p>Right after he had placed a thin slice of fish in his mouth, he caught sight of Xiao Bojian, who was sitting across from him, reaching into the large plate with a spoon. After some quick maneuvering with his chopsticks, when his spoon was lifted up from the sea of red chillis, it was full of tender, white fish slices\u2026</p><br/><p>Following that, He Changqi watched with wide eyes as Xiao Bojian poured all the fish slices into his small white porcelain bowl\u2026</p><br/><p>Next, his empty spoon reached out once again towards the plate of poached fish\u2026</p><br/><p>What the heck\u2026 What happened to their noblemen\u2019s gathering? There were only hungry ghosts sitting at this table!</p><br/><p>A meal that should have been filled with conversation, laughter and drink\u2026 ended in just an hour.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

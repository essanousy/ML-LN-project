Her craving hadn\u2019t been satisfied and she wanted to eat more!</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t think that He Changdi would start minding what she ate, so she wasn\u2019t very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Changdi, I want to eat pears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian complained to him directly. They had made an agreement today that they would tell each other everything and that they wouldn\u2019t have cold wars or sulk by themselves.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang wanted to laugh when he heard the rare childish tone from Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>He whispered, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m just playing with you? You can\u2019t eat cold-natured fruit right now. I\u2019ll explain it to you when we get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Chu Lian was slightly baffled. What was going on? Why were fruits suddenly forbidden?</p><br/><p>She had even ate ice cream during winter back in modern times and nothing had happened to her health.</p><br/><p>When he finished speaking, He Changdi quickly dragged Chu Lian back to Songtao Court.</p><br/><p>It was already dinner time. Senior Servant Zhong had already received the report that the young couple was on their way back, so she began to instruct the maidservants to prepare dinner.</p><br/><p>By the time Chu Lian and He Changdi arrived, there was already a table full of food in the parlour.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian looked over all the foods on the table, she couldn\u2019t drum up any of her appetite.</p><br/><p>She was feeling stuffy and uncomfortable since He Changdi had pulled her into a brisk walk back from Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s courtyard. She wanted to eat something cold right now, but everything on the table was steaming with heat. She really didn\u2019t have any appetite.</p><br/><p>However, He Changdi had pulled her down to sit at the table.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sighed, then turned her head to instruct Baicha, \u201cBring me a cup of tea first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baicha was surprised, \u201cThird Young Madam, do you mean sencha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded in affirmation.</p><br/><p>Baicha thought it was strange and glanced in askance at Xiyan. Didn\u2019t Third Young Madam dislike sencha? Didn\u2019t she normally only drink honey water or honeydew juice?</p><br/><p>Baicha was stopped by He Changdi\u2019s icy gaze right when she was about to go prepare the sencha.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed that Baicha wasn\u2019t moving. When she traced the cause back to He Changdi, she exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cHe Changdi, do you have a problem? You\u2019re not even going to let me drink some tea!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s face darkened after being reprimanded by his wife. He waved his hand to order the attending servants to leave.</p><br/><p>A moment later, they were the only ones left in the parlour.</p><br/><p>He Changdi sat beside Chu Lian in the quiet and empty parlour. Since there wasn\u2019t anyone else in the parlour, he tugged Chu Lian onto his lap with an easy wave of his arm.</p><br/><p>With Chu Lian\u2019s petite figure, trying to resist He Sanlang was like an ant trying to move a tree. She struggled a little to no avail, so she gave up.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was still trying to resist at this time, He Sanlang reached towards the softness of her chest and squeezed it. He lowered his voice and scolded her, \u201cAre you going to behave?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know if it was something to do with the tonic that she had drunk, but Chu Lian\u2019s whole body felt like it was on fire when he casually teased her. She stiffened up, not daring to move again.</p><br/><p>She gritted her teeth and smacked He Sanlang\u2019s hand away. She replied with rising anger, \u201cHe Changdi, if you don\u2019t give me an explanation now, then don\u2019t expect to stop me from eating pears!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t know how he should react. She usually acted so clever, but she was actually just a glutton. She couldn\u2019t be kept from any of her cravings at all.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang put some strength into his arms and cuddled Chu Lian. He let out a light sigh and asked, \u201cI believe the maidservants have already told you about the situation with your body, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy body\u2019s slightly cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe nourishing tonic that you\u2019re drinking twice a day was decided upon after much deliberation from Great Doctor Miao and Senior Servant Zhong. It contains some special medicinal herbs that will help to supplement the warmth of your body, but you have to avoid cold-natured foods. While you\u2019re drinking this tonic, you\u2019re not allowed to eat anything cold.\u201d He Sanlang patiently explained to her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian instantly wailed when she heard his words. She knew that it was difficult to balance the inner systems of a body. Great Doctor Miao was already being nice by not prescribing her those really bitter medicines. But drinking this nourishing soup was also suffering for her!</p><br/><p>The corners of Chu Lian\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cHow long do I have to drink this tonic for?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

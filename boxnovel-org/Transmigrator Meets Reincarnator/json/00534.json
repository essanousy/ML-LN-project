He first swept his icy gaze over to Xiyan, who was standing beside Chu Lian. Xiyan\u2019s whole body froze as a troubled expression appeared on her face. Following that, He Sanlang strode towards Countess Jing\u2019an and bowed in greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cSanlang, you\u2019ve come too! Come, come sit beside Mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an was clearly happy that her youngest son had come to visit her. He Changdi quickly sat down beside his mother. Once seated, he extended his long arm and took away the plate of pear slices on the table beside Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>When the toothpick that Chu Lian was holding landed on thin air, she looked at him in astonishment.</p><br/><p>What was wrong with He Changdi? She couldn\u2019t even eat a few pieces of pear now?</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an was also finding it strange, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Since Lian\u2019er likes to eat pears, why not let her have a few more pieces? I haven\u2019t been eating them much so it\u2019s a waste to leave them lying around here anyway. Have the maidservants take some back with you later. Mother has too many pears to finish!\u201d</p><br/><p>The first half of her words was directed at He Sanlang and the latter half was directed towards Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Before Chu Lian could happily agree and thank her mother-in-law, He Changdi had already rejected the offer, \u201cNo need. Mother, you should keep the pears and eat them yourself. If you can\u2019t finish them all, then give them to the servants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hadn\u2019t been expecting He Sanlang to say that, so she secretly gave him a glare. However, He Changdi was seemingly ignorant of the complaint in her eyes. He continued to speak to his mother, \u201cPears are cold by nature. Lian\u2019er is susceptible to the cold, so it wouldn\u2019t be good for her health if she eats too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an initially wanted to put in a good word or two for Chu Lian, but she held her tongue when she saw that her son was doing it for the sake of his wife\u2019s health. Instead, she turned to comfort Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, Sanlang is right. We have to take good care of our own health. It\u2019s better to eat fewer of these \u2018cold\u2019 fruits. It\u2019s still chilly outside now, so you should make sure to keep your body warm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an had been bedridden for many years and had been drinking different medicines during that whole time. She had become half a doctor after going through a prolonged period of illness. During the long suffering, she had also learned plenty of methods to maintain good health. Once she started on the topic, she couldn\u2019t stop talking.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t interrupt her since the countess was her elder. All she could do was to listen earnestly and put on an enlightened expression, while suffering in her heart.</p><br/><p>Now that the root of Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s illness was gone, her health had improved by leaps and bounds. She had also become more livelier than before. With her new-found energy, she actually managed to talk about the subject of health for an hour.</p><br/><p>When the countess finally realised what she had done, she felt embarrassed for a moment.</p><br/><p>However, since it was only her son and daughter-in-law before her, the moment of embarrassment faded away quickly.</p><br/><p>She was happy for the young couple instead, as she saw the genuine concern in the gaze that her son directed at his wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I hope you don\u2019t find me too naggy. But you must pay attention to your health no matter how busy you are. Lian\u2019er, as a woman, it\u2019s especially important for you to take good care of your body. That\u2019s all from me today. It\u2019s getting late now. I won\u2019t keep you two for dinner, so go back to eat by yourselves.\u201d Countess Jing\u2019an could also see the suffering expressions on the young couple\u2019s faces from her long lecture, so she waved her hand to dismiss them.</p><br/><p>Even He Sanlang hadn\u2019t been able to withstand his mother\u2019s endless nagging. He breathed a sigh of relief after leaving the courtyard while holding Chu Lian\u2019s hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even One couldn\u2019t stop him in time.</p><br/><p>One helplessly shook his head. Afraid that the situation would take a turn for the worse, he decided to take up the spot Laiyue was in earlier and guard the door.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan wanted to go in as well after seeing Xiao Bojian head inside. Fortunately, Second Madam still had the presence of mind to pull her back.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian had an ugly grimace on, as he pushed away the curtains and entered the room.</p><br/><p>Second Master Chu Qizheng was standing by the bed with a blank expression, shocked beyond words.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian took in the room at one glance, but all he could see from his angle were the figures of two people lying down together in the bed.</p><br/><p>In a moment of panic, he actually pushed Chu Qizheng aside and lifted up the curtains around the bed. The sight of two strangers entered his view no, that wasn\u2019t right, the naked woman was someone he knew, she was one of the subordinates he had sent to execute the plan\u2026</p><br/><p>As for the unconscious man, Xiao Bojian had a slight inkling as to who he was. He looked like a distant relative of the Eighth Miss, Chu Yuan. Xiao Bojian had seen him once before by sheer coincidence.</p><br/><p>The tension in Xiao Bojian\u2019s heart disappeared in an instant. He subconsciously wiped away the cold sweat that had gathered on his forehead.</p><br/><p>What a relief\u2026 Lian\u2019er was unharmed.</p><br/><p>With the burden on his heart released, Xiao Bojian returned to his usual calm and gloomy self in the next moment.</p><br/><p>There was a grim look on his face as he turned to look at Chu Qizheng. He gave off a cold sneer as he said, \u201cIt seems like Sir Chu isn\u2019t worthy of trust when it comes to business. Our deal is off. All the best to you, <i>Sir</i> Chu.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, it was obvious that Xiao Bojian was now aware that he had been fooled by the second branch of House Ying.</p><br/><p>Chu Qizheng hadn\u2019t thought that Xiao Bojian would figure things out so quickly, so he hastily explained, \u201cMister Xiao, I do not know why things happened this way either! Perhaps it was those two skilled handmaids around Chu Lian who turned the tables. This has absolutely nothing to do with me. You\u2019ve agreed to marrying Miss Yuan, how can you go back on your word!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s patience had been thoroughly depleted. He let out a cold snort as he walked past Chu Qizheng, not even deigning to give him a reply.</p><br/><p>Chu Qizheng was shocked by the lack of reaction from Xiao Bojian. It took him a few seconds to recover and scold with a low, raspy shout, \u201cXiao Bojian, don\u2019t forget who your teacher is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t matter how angry Chu Qizheng got, as Xiao Bojian quickly vanished from his field of vision.</p><br/><p>Chu Qizheng staggered a few steps forward as all his energy left his body. Luckily, he managed to grab onto an old wooden rack, or he would have fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>Chu Qizheng took some time to put up a calm front before leaving the room. The first thing he did was to walk up to Second Madam in fury and berate her, \u201cAll you do is cause trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then turned to Miss Yuan, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you returned to your damned room!? You\u2019re getting more and more outrageous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even someone as slow as Miss Yuan could tell that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Her father had only revealed these plans to her after discussing them with her mother, so why would her father chastise her at a time like this? There was only one possible reason for that: the plan had failed!</p><br/><p>Chu Qizheng left the scene quickly, charging out of the courtyard furiously with his attendants, while Second Madam and Miss Yuan went into the room with disbelief.</p><br/><p>They looked all over the room, but they couldn\u2019t find any trace of Chu Lian, even down to her dirty clothes! Chu Yuan stared blankly in shock. There was a terrible expression on her face.</p><br/><p>This whole affair turned out to be a dramatic play where they had ended up shooting themselves in the foot, so the gossipy expressions of the ladies who had tagged along with Chu Yuan faded into awkward silence.</p><br/><p>The news of Miss Yuan falsely accusing her own sister of adultery at her own coming-of-age ceremony would likely spread everywhere soon.</p><br/><p>When that happened, there would probably be no one who would speak up for her or even take her side.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

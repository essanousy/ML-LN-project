However, after speaking, he found that he had only become even more nervous. His gaze subconsciously landed on Chu Lian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>There was no good way to describe what Chu Lian\u2019s expression looked like now. The closest approximation was \u2018like she had stepped in dog poop\u2019.</p><br/><p>Sigh\u2026 This lunatic He Sanlang\u2026 When had she ever not tried to get along with him?</p><br/><p>She had focused on cooking good food to raise her standard of living, respected her elders and even earnestly started a business to earn money. She was living perfectly well!</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t the one throwing fits of lunacy since their wedding night!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian fought the urge to smile out of overwhelming anger. Wasn\u2019t it lucky for him that she was the He Family\u2019s Third Young Madam? If he had said that to any other noble lady, wouldn\u2019t they have expired on the spot from frustration?</p><br/><p>When He Changdi noticed the mocking expression on Chu Lian\u2019s face, his body froze up and his lips pressed together into a thin line as his expression turned colder and colder. The hands hidden under his sleeves slowly tensed into fists.</p><br/><p>He wanted to speak, but he found that he couldn\u2019t say a word when faced with the sort of expression on Chu Lian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tilted her head to the side and started examining the tall He Sanlang the Fair, who would still tower over her by half a head even when seated.</p><br/><p>At this moment, He Sanlang\u2019s fine features were contorted with tension. There was an aura of restraint around him, as if he was a dog trying to suppress the feelings of having been abandoned by his master.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled, \u201cHe Changdi, what\u2019s with that pitiful act? It\u2019s not like I abandoned you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s current expression was extremely entertaining. He stared at Chu Lian with wide eyes. Her reply had been completely out of his expectations.</p><br/><p>Before he could gather his wits to summon a reply, Chu Lian continued her tirade, \u201cHaven\u2019t you realised it yet? I\u2019ve always been trying to get along with you! Otherwise, why would I have come all the way out to this poor and desolate place? Why else would I be sitting right next to you now? Are you taking me for a fool?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fog covering He Sanlang\u2019s eyes seemed to have lifted in an instant.</p><br/><p>Shame and guilt flashed through his eyes. Chu Lian\u2019s mocking words felt like a slap to his face. Although it didn\u2019t hurt, he was still upset.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Hadn\u2019t he been the one determined not to get along with her?</p><br/><p>Although he hadn\u2019t caused any physical or fatal harm to Chu Lian\u2019s body, ever since their wedding day, all of his actions had been damaging Chu Lian\u2019s reputation and self-respect.</p><br/><p>How hilarious. How could he have had the guts to ask Chu Lian to \u2018get along well\u2019 with him? He deserved every word of ridicule from her.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang pressed his lips and parted them, yet he just couldn\u2019t let a single sound out.</p><br/><p>The smile on Chu Lian\u2019s face slowly faded away. She looked up at that handsome face with her almond-shaped eyes. \u201cHe Changdi, is it so hard to say that you\u2019re sorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian no longer wanted to wait for his apology. She abruptly stood up, but her legs were numb from kneeling down for too long. Her body refused to listen to her commands and wavered. He Changdi was about to reach out to support her, but Chu Lian recovered her balance and stabilised herself before he could do so.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s outstretched arms looked pitifully lonely and useless. He lowered them in desolation.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian watched all this happen, but her heart was set.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Changdi, it\u2019s getting late. Lieutenant Xiao must be suffering in the cold wind outside. You have a mission to carry out tomorrow as well, so I\u2019ll stop bothering you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving behind these words, Chu Lian turned and quickly left. Although her figure seemed slender and weak, she moved faster than expected. She was already long gone by the time He Changdi thought to chase after her.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian stepped out of the tent, the cold northern winds were like a slap to her face, instantly calming down her tumultuous emotions. Chu Lian took in a deep breath, but her expression didn\u2019t improve.</p><br/><p>The tent had muffled all the sounds from inside, so Xiao Hongyu, Wenqing and Wenlan didn\u2019t know what the couple had discussed. However, judging from Chu Lian\u2019s expression, all of them could tell that the couple had fought.</p><br/><p>Wenlan quickly hurried forward to wrap a cloak around Chu Lian. Xiaoju stepped up to welcome her, \u201cHonoured Lady, our general has charged this subordinate with the duty of leading Honoured Lady to a place to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo had been intending to send Chu Lian over to the women\u2019s camp for the night anyway. It was even better that Sima Hui had sent one of her most trusted adjutants over to lead Chu Lian there personally.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled at Xiaoju. She wasn\u2019t an unreasonable person. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be troubling your general. I\u2019ll head over right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was Xiaoju\u2019s first time interacting with Chu Lian, she felt that it was easy to interact with the baby-faced Honoured Lady Jinyi. Her personality was also straightforward, unlike most of the noble ladies in the capital.</p><br/><p>Xiaoju was already used to living in the army with her mistress, so she hated the way that noble ladies would talk in circles with hidden meanings. It was better to be honest and direct in everything.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian followed Xiaoju to Sima Hui\u2019s tent with Wenqing and Wenlan behind her.</p><br/><p>When He Sanlang came out of his tent, all that he caught was Chu Lian\u2019s slender back walking into the flurry of snow.</p><br/><p>Noticing that He Changdi\u2019s expression was very gloomy, Xiao Hongyu acted appropriately for once and said, \u201cBrother He, Sister-in-Law has gone over to General Sima\u2019s camp. Don\u2019t worry, Brother Guo has already made a proper request to General Sima, the general won\u2019t mistreat Sister-in-Law.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t reply Xiao Hongyu. He simply stood at the tent entrance and watched until Chu Lian\u2019s silhouette had completely faded into the darkness of the snowy night. He finally turned around and returned to the tent. However, for some reason, when he heard from Xiao Hongyu that Sima Hui had sent her trusted female adjutant to welcome Chu Lian, there was a hint of upset in his heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

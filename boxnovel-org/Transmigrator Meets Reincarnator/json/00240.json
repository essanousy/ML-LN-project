Please read from the original source!</p><br/><p>\u201cSleepy birds return to the forest at dusk, floating clouds return to the mountain when it\u2019s clear. Congratulations to Guilin Restaurant for its grand reopening!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guilin Restaurant, Guilin Restaurant?</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s Guilin Restaurant!</p><br/><p>Many of the old gourmands standing below the stage had a sudden spark of realisation. Following that, they shouted out in excitement.</p><br/><p>Others in the crowd stared strangely at the old foodies.</p><br/><p>A white-bearded old gourmand posed in deep thought as he stroked his beard. He made sure that the people around him were itching with curiosity before he started speaking, \u201cThis Guilin Restaurant is one of the old well-known restaurants in the capital. It\u2019s located where the entrance of the old west market used to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was a restaurant!</p><br/><p>The crowd finally realised what was going on.</p><br/><p>After such a huge buzz, it was just a restaurant? And here they were thinking that it was some grand event!</p><br/><p>The news spread quickly, and the originally festive atmosphere brought about by the lion dancers and the lively song dampened a little.</p><br/><p>Some people reacted with disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering what was going on. So it\u2019s just the opening of a restaurant, and an old poor one at that. It\u2019s even located in that desolate old west market. Does the owner of the restaurant even know how to do business? Who\u2019s going to go to a place like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA restaurant? They actually dared to open a restaurant? There are already over ten or more famous restaurants on Zhuque Avenue alone. They\u2019re really overestimating themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we can all just leave now. What else are you waiting for? Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far off, the watching Manager Qin smirked.</p><br/><p>By this time, a young server had come up to greet him. \u201cMaster Qin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everything ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>The server stood to the side and revealed the things arranged behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other five points in the city are also ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin\u2019s gaze landed on the three mid-sized jars behind the server and he nodded at the young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring them up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The server immediately called up a few men behind him to help.</p><br/><p>Just as the crowd was about to disperse, Manager Qin walked up onto the stage.</p><br/><p>The moment he entered the stage, the drummers in the troupe hit their drums with two forceful strokes.</p><br/><p>The crowd\u2019s attention was once again drawn to the stage.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin was dressed in a sapphire blue brocade robe. His black hair was tucked away neatly into his headpiece. Dressed as he was, he didn\u2019t seem like a servant; rather, he seemed more like a scholar.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin was someone who knew how to give off a good impression. He bowed slightly in a semicircle facing the crowd, instantly drawing their favour.</p><br/><p>With a slightly raised voice, he said courteously, \u201cIt\u2019s the opening of my master\u2019s restaurant today. Firstly, thank you all for coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this first line, Manager Qin bowed to the crowd once again before continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master would like to pass on these words. Guilin Restaurant is one of the old restaurants in this capital after all, so it wouldn\u2019t be good if it were to fail in her hands. For today\u2019s opening, my master has specially instructed me to treat everyone to a taste of Guilin Restaurant\u2019s cooking. If you think it\u2019s good, you can draw a lot to win a seat at today\u2019s free tasting feast in Guilin Restaurant. My master said this: we\u2019re going to make our Guilin Restaurant the best restaurant in this capital, or quit the business entirely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wow, what a boast!</p><br/><p>Manager Qin\u2019s words had practically drawn all the hatred of the other restaurants.</p><br/><p>His words had offended all the famous restaurants in the capital at once. Quite a few of the people in the crowd today were the managers and servers of the big restaurants in the capital!</p><br/><p>Without waiting for those managers and servers to stand out to scold him, some of the ardent supporters of those restaurants had already stepped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! It\u2019s obviously Yuehong Restaurant that makes the best food in the capital!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026what?! It\u2019s De\u2019an Restaurant\u2019s feast that\u2019s the best! You\u2019re just a nameless little rascal, how dare you talk so wildly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The huge crowd of people had a favourable impression of this scholarly manager at first. However, after his great boast, they only thought that he couldn\u2019t tell good from bad and was too cheeky for his own good.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the sounds of chiding and cursing filled the area below the stage.</p><br/><p>TL Note: \u2018Sleepy birds return to the forest at dusk, floating clouds return to the mountain when it\u2019s clear.\u2019 \u2013 This is a pretty Chinese poem incorporating Guilin\u2019s name, which means \u2018return to the forest\u2019.</p><br/><p>Regarding the managers, servers, and other staff of the restaurant, the modern English terms don\u2019t quite match the context of the ancient Chinese restaurant staff, but I tried my best so that we don\u2019t have more pinyin terms in the text.</p><br/><p>Manager \u2013 runs the restaurant on behalf of an owner/master</p><br/><p>Server \u2013 mid-level staff who can wait on tables and settle bills</p><br/><p>Runner \u2013 welcomes customers from the street, waits on tables</p><br/><p>Why not \u2018waiter\u2019? Well, the servers here are doing all sorts of menial labour too, which is not quite related to the term \u2018waiter\u2019, which makes me think of high-class restaurants. I thought that \u2018server\u2019 might be a more neutral term. Give me your thoughts on this!</p><br/><p>Customers will also call for the staff by their titles, but it would be weird to hear, \u201cServer! Runner!\u201d so this might be replaced by \u201cWaiter!\u201d when it appears. &gt;w&lt;</p><br/>\n</div>"}

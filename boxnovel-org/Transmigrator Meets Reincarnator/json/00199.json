Finally, the princess\u2019s gaze landed on the remains of the half-eaten mooncake in her left hand. The princess blinked and asked, \u201cChu Liu, what are you eating?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she heard that, Chu Lian didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. She held up the remaining mooncake in her hand and replied honestly, \u201cThis is a type of snack I made earlier; it\u2019s called mooncake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMooncake? It sounds really tasty. Chu Liu, how could you bring snacks into the palace? Why didn\u2019t you bring some for me, too?!\u201d Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s cheeks puffed up as she questioned her friend.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian replied very intelligently with an \u2018uhhhh\u2019. She really didn\u2019t know how to deal with Royal Princess Duanjia.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Royal Princess Duanjia held out an open palm in front of her face.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at Princess Duanjia\u2019s face in befuddlement before looking at her open palm. \u201cPrincess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you blanking out for? Hand over all your food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, you were a little too late. I just finished everything; there\u2019s only this half left\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pressed a hand against her forehead. Why were the people around her such gluttons for food?! It was just a simple snack, so why were there waves of people trying to snatch it away from her? Did they really have to be this way?!</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia thought for a moment before harrumphing in her uniquely tsundere manner. \u201cWell, if you\u2019ve only got that half left, then so be it. I just want a small taste first. You\u2019ll make more for me later anyway, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at her. This half was only a half because she\u2019d eaten the rest already. Her saliva was already on it\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, Chu Lian didn\u2019t have any other choice but to hand it over. \u201cIf Royal Princess Duanjia would like more, there\u2019s still one more box of it that my maidservants are carrying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia tossed the piece of mooncake into her mouth without any hesitation. She chewed it for a bit before her eyes lit up. \u201cChu Liu, this \u2018mooncake\u2019 is a lot tastier than those round cakes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eunuch Sun\u2019s eyes were twitching when he saw the normally calm, cool, and collected Royal Princess Duanjia was acting like a naive, haughty child.</p><br/><p>The two girls sat in Mixiang Pavilion for a while longer. However, because Chu Lian was afraid that more strange people would pop out of the bushes, she dragged Royal Princess Duanjia off to the Empress Dowager\u2019s Ninghe Palace before long.</p><br/><p>At a corner hidden out of sight from Mixiang Pavilion, Eunuch Wei stood before the Emperor. He offered the purse he took from Chu Lian to the Emperor with both hands, and the Emperor, in turn, received it.</p><br/><p>The purse itself was light in colour, and there was some oil paper sewn inside of it. On the outside, the embroidery was fairly elaborate, but it wasn\u2019t anything special. It looked just like a simple snack purse that any noble would prepare for their children.</p><br/><p>The Emperor opened the little purse and looked inside, only to see the last remaining pastry within. It was about half the size of an egg and circular in shape, and its maker had imprinted the word \u2018fortune\u2019 on top of it. Overall, it looked delightful and well-made.</p><br/><p>The Emperor took it out and had a taste. His deep eyes squinted. The stuffing inside was actually quite salty!</p><br/><p>When he took a closer look, he discovered that the stuffing was made of salty egg yolk.</p><br/><p>It seemed that that girl did possess some talent in the culinary arts after all.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei stood behind the Chengping Emperor, sweating a little. If Honoured Lady Jinyi hadn\u2019t already been married off to House Jing\u2019an\u2019s third son, he would have thought that their Emperor\u2019s heart had been moved by the Honoured Lady.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pastry is quite good. Since Jinyi was able to make it, then it\u2019s not strange that she could have made better longevity peach buns than Mr Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is exactly as the Emperor says. Honoured Lady Jinyi seems a little different from most noble ladies!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chengping Emperor finished the mooncake in just two or three bites. He seemed to have recalled something, as he burst into laughter and said, \u201cShe is indeed a little different from most. She\u2019s much braver than the average noble lady as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Eunuch Wei\u2019s mouth twitched. Wasn\u2019t that just so? If it had been any other lady who had found a disgusting, black, wriggling worm inside of a fresh peach, they would have surely screamed in fright. However, Honoured Lady Jinyi had the guts to pick out that disgusting worm and instead used it to scare the person who had tried to prank her instead.</p><br/><p>However, when he thought back to how Imperial Concubine Wei and her handmaid had tried to trick Jinyi into losing composure before the Emperor, Eunuch Wei thought that Honoured Lady Jinyi\u2019s actions had really made for quite the satisfying end.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Since the letter had been received by one of her handmaidens, he assumed the letter would definitely reach Chu Lian\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>When Wenqing returned and found that the letter had disappeared, she was scared out of her wits. She rummaged through the entire room, but couldn\u2019t find it. After her bout of panic, she eventually fell sick and couldn\u2019t get out of bed for a few days.</p><br/><p>While recovering from her illness, Wenqing could only console herself by thinking that she must have accidentally dropped it somewhere. Even if she had dropped it within Songtao Court, only Chu Lian\u2019s personal maidservants knew how to read. Since the incident had already happened, Wenqing didn\u2019t dare to report it to Wenlan or Senior Servant Zhong, and simply let it pass.</p><br/><p>Once Chu Lian had returned to her bedroom in Songtao Court, she ordered Xiyan to bring out the box of accessories.</p><br/><p>The moment the pear blossom wood box was opened, the dazzling glow of treasure inside was revealed. Senior Servant Gui, Senior Servant Zhong, Wenlan, and the rest who hadn\u2019t gone to the Dingyuan Estate were blinded by the sight.</p><br/><p>What? Had Third Young Madam gone shopping at a jewellery store instead of attending Old Marquis Dingyuan\u2019s longevity feast today?</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian looked up and noticed the shock on everyone\u2019s faces, she smiled mischievously. She took out Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s \u2018gracious\u2019 contribution to the pot, the exquisite little golden qilin statue, and showed it off to them. \u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t it pretty?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could it possibly not be pretty? That was something that the empress had ordered a special craftsmen\u2019s guild to make by hand!</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui and Senior Servant Zhong nodded in a daze.</p><br/><p>It was Senior Servant Gui who recovered first. \u201cThird\u2026 Third Young Madam, where did you get all this jewellery from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Those couldn\u2019t possibly be visiting gifts from the Dingyuan Estate. If the Dingyuan Estate gave away things like that to their visitors, their doorstep would have been flattened by the crowds flocking there.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook the box of accessories while grinning from ear to ear. These were all top-quality goods, except for a few more normal-looking golden hairpins and bangles. However, even if their quality was just average, they were still worth a hefty sum.</p><br/><p>The best items of the lot were Lady Yang\u2019s red coral bracelet, Madam Huang\u2019s pink pearl bracelet, Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s white jade ring, and Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s golden qilin statue.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shot a look at Xiyan before looking down into the box and picking out accessories to play with.</p><br/><p>Xiyan understood Chu Lian\u2019s hint, and explained everything that had happened at the Dingyuan Estate to the rest.</p><br/><p>Senior Servants Gui and Zhong were shocked; they hadn\u2019t expected Third Young Madam to run head-first into a plot like that just by visiting the Dingyuan Estate.</p><br/><p>However, after they had recovered from their fright, admiration blossomed in their hearts for their young madam. There must have been plenty of high-ranking officials\u2019 wives at the feast. Chu Lian was only fifteen years old, yet she had managed to deal with the situation with calm and poise. It must have been tough on her.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui frowned upon looking at the various expensive accessories placed on the table. When she thought about the noble madams whom the accessories belonged to, she couldn\u2019t help but break out into cold sweat. Turning to look at her young madam, she saw that Chu Lian was happily playing with her spoils of war without a care. Senior Servant Gui started worrying about her naivete.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t her master\u2026 a little too innocent\u2026?</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui didn\u2019t want to speak of it in front of Senior Servant Zhong; she wanted to wait until everyone had been dismissed before reminding Chu Lian of the consequences of taking things from those high-ranking noble madams.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t expect Chu Lian to pass two sets of solid golden hairpins and bangles to her. \u201cMomo, take these and melt them into gold, then change them into banknotes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Senior Servant Gui couldn\u2019t decide whether to receive the accessories or not.</p><br/><p>Instead, she decided to tactfully remind her of their origin. \u201cThird Young Madam, these accessories belong to those noble madams.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be too good if she took other people\u2019s precious jewellery to melt, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all mine now. Momo, don\u2019t worry about it; I know what I\u2019m doing. Take them. Right, remember that list I gave you the other time? Follow the instructions there and have the items made before you bring them back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Chu Lian had already spoken, Senior Servant Gui could only accept the accessories.</p><br/><p>Although Senior Servant Zhong didn\u2019t say a word, she made a mental note to question Wenqing thoroughly later on.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

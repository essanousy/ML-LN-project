She reached out and tugged at Miss Su\u2019s sleeve with a smile as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s about time now. Fifth Sister, Seventh Sister, Ninth Sister, the kitchen will send our meal over soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Su quickly shot a glance at the table behind them before looking at Chu Lian again. When she noticed that Chu Lian\u2019s expression was calm, she inwardly heaved a sigh of relief before leading Chu Lian down to sit by the table.</p><br/><p>As much as Miss Su and Miss Fu wanted to avoid creating any awkward situations, with Miss Yuan around, how could that be possible?</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan sent another look at her handmaid. The handmaid then brought over a tray with the freshly brewed tea with an arrogant swagger to her walk. She kept her haughty expression even as she set a teacup in front of each of the ladies at the table.</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan picked up the white porcelain teacup and lifted it to her nose. After a short sniff, she acted as if she was drunk on the smell of the tea. She then smiled and boastfully said, \u201cSixth Sister, I usually drink this Zhengshan tea at home, thanks to Grandfather and Grandmother\u2019s love for me. After getting used to it, I just can\u2019t drink any of this North Fujian loose-leaf tea of yours. I\u2019m sure Sixth Sister has never had a chance to taste this Zhengshan tea before. Why don\u2019t you try some?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at Miss Yuan with her big, bright eyes- eyes that seemed like they could see through everyone\u2019s hearts. Miss Yuan didn\u2019t dare to meet that gaze and hurriedly looked away. Even though she should have been pleased with herself, there was a mysterious sense of guilt in her heart.</p><br/><p>Miss Su and Miss Fu stiffened in surprise and turned to Chu Lian with peculiar expressions.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian innocently blinked. \u201cThank you for the offer, Seventh Sister, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t like sencha anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had absolutely zero interest towards sencha. Forget Zhengshan; even if it was the highest grade of tea straight from the imperial tribute itself, Chu Lian still wouldn\u2019t be interested. Seventh Miss Chu Yuan could slowly savour her precious Zhengshan tea by herself.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s answer was completely out of Miss Yuan\u2019s expectations. She stared at Chu Lian with wide eyes, her true emotions completely revealed on her face despite her best efforts to hide them.</p><br/><p>How could that be? Back in the Ying Estate, Chu Lian had taken utmost pride in her sencha-brewing skill. Even Old Duke Ying had praised her for it once. At every special occasion or family banquet, she would always offer to brew some sencha to show off her skills and earn the favour of the older members in their family. However, despite her skill in tea ceremony, she still wasn\u2019t able to get any high-quality tea in her hands. Miss Yuan always mocked her for that, even purposely wasting precious high-quality tea right in front of her eyes. </p><br/><p>Today, she had gotten this Zhengshan tea specifically to provoke her. How could Chu Lian say that she didn\u2019t like sencha anymore!</p><br/><p>How could someone who had previously been so in love with sencha suddenly change her mind? Was that even possible?</p><br/><p>All sorts of thoughts ran through Miss Yuan\u2019s head for a while before she finally managed to calm down. She found the perfect excuse for herself and decided that Chu Lian was just hiding her real emotions. She was probably going mad with envy and jealousy inside, and only acting as if nothing was wrong on the surface.</p><br/><p>Saying that she didn\u2019t want to drink the tea was just to avoid feeling sad over it.</p><br/><p>Hmph, she had already figured out exactly what that Chu Lian was thinking!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Sixth Sister doesn\u2019t like it, then the three of us will drink it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, she took a sip right in front of Chu Lian, and even purposely started telling Miss Fu how sweet and aromatic the tea was and how it contained all sorts of flavours.</p><br/><p>If Chu Lian knew that Miss Yuan\u2019s abnormal behaviour was meant to provoke her, she would have rolled her eyes directly at Miss Yuan.</p><br/><p>Since she was so good at jumping to conclusions, why didn\u2019t she just jump straight up to heaven?</p><br/><p>Conversely, Miss Su was the one who looked at Chu Lian with worry. \u201cSixth Sister, you used to love sencha so much. Why don\u2019t you like it anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian reassured her with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why, but I just lost all liking for it. Now I prefer to drink honey water or fruit teas. Perhaps our tastebuds just change with time.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Miss Su heard her explanation, she got lost a little in her thoughts. When she thought of how different Chu Lian\u2019s life had turned after marrying into House Jing\u2019an, she didn\u2019t know whether she felt more sympathy or happiness for Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cSixth Sister said it well. You\u2019ll be happy as long as you follow your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan glanced at them from the corner of her eyes. Her mind was filled with hatred as she thought, \u2018Keep acting, just keep acting! I want to see how long Chu Lian can keep acting for!\u2019</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t have any energy to waste on guessing Miss Yuan\u2019s thoughts. There was so much on her plate. There was no need to bother with a small fry like Miss Yuan who only knew how to jump up and down in a temper. She wasn\u2019t the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 so Miss Yuan was just a stranger to her. As long as Miss Yuan didn\u2019t go overboard, she wouldn\u2019t use any of her limited time and energy to deal with her.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 anymore and she didn\u2019t share any of her past likes. If she suddenly changed all at once, it might draw unnecessary attention, so why not remind her maiden family bit by bit that she was slowly starting to change? She was no longer that Chu Lian who stayed hidden in the Ying Estate.</p><br/><p>Telling them that she no longer liked sencha was just the start.</p><br/><p>She believed that Miss Su would remember her words. As long as Miss Su knew this, Madam Rong would naturally find out about it as well, and if Madam Rong knew, then so did the entire Ying Estate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

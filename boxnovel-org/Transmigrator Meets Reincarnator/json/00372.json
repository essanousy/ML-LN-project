He looked like he was preparing to settle down and watch a good show. When Zhang Mai spotted what their youngest member had done, he slapped the back of Xiao Hongyu\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo was the eldest of the group and the most mature one. He peeked at He Sanlang\u2019s cold expression and realised that he wasn\u2019t going to speak up. In the end, Captain Guo had to take up the role of speaking for the group and made a greeting bow towards Sima Hui. \u201cHow may we assist you, General Sima?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Sima Hui\u2019s features gave off a certain heroic spirit that most girls wouldn\u2019t have, she looked especially gentle when she smiled. Her actions were also upright and straightforward, so most of the officers in the army held a good impression of her.</p><br/><p>Since Sima Hui was trying to be friendly, they couldn\u2019t just reject her overtures. She was a woman too, so that meant that it would be an even greater faux pas if they didn\u2019t respond to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis general heard that Honoured Lady Jinyi has come to the camp today. The last time Honoured Lady came over with extra supplies, this general wasn\u2019t able to meet her, so this time, this general has to pay her a visit today at the very least.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Sima\u2019s reason made it hard for them to reject her. Since the general was here to visit Chu Lian and they were both female, they couldn\u2019t really stop them as a bunch of guys.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was already pretty late now. Honoured Lady Jinyi definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to return to Liangzhou City tonight. He Sanlang shared a tent with Xiao Hongyu and it wasn\u2019t appropriate for them to let He Sanlang and his wife have the tent by themselves. They would have to request for assistance from General Sima in the end anyway.</p><br/><p>If they offended her at this point, it wouldn\u2019t be good for them.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo\u2019s thoughts ran quickly. He spoke with a polite tone, \u201cWe\u2019re on our way to visit Honoured Lady as well. Since General Sima has the same intention, why don\u2019t we go together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu saw that He Changdi\u2019s gaze hadn\u2019t even grazed Sima Hui\u2019s body for even a second, so he rubbed the back of his head. When there wasn\u2019t any exciting gossip or drama to look at, he felt a little bored.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai and Xiao Hongyu had no objections to Sima Hui\u2019s addition to their party. Only He Changdi seemed to be emanating an icy aura to keep people thousands of miles away from his person, but his unspoken opinion was automatically disregarded.</p><br/><p>Sima Hui\u2019s gaze drifted casually over to He Changdi. When she realised that his eyes hadn\u2019t turned in her direction even once, a pang of pain rose in her heart before abruptly fading into nothing.</p><br/><p>She smiled mockingly at herself inwardly. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible between them anyway, it was better if she could let it go.</p><br/><p>After finally letting go of the twisted emotions in her heart, self-confidence returned to Sima Hui\u2019s expression and she started exuding a charismatic and magnetic aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s so, let\u2019s go together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s teppanyaki had been rather good, especially when paired with that warming lamb organ soup. After she had gulped down the bowl of soup, it felt like her entire body had warmed up.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had her plate in hand as she ate her late dinner. However, she was only able to eat a few bites of the delicious grilled beef slices before the guards outside announced, \u201cReporting to Honoured Lady, General Sima, Captain Guo, Captain He, Lieutenant Xiao and Lieutenant Zhang are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of her lips twitched. What was up with this group of people? Their noses were even better than those of dogs! They were somehow able to come by every time she was having a meal.</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan both stiffened and froze at the same time, their faces turning pale. They exchanged troubled looks. What were they to do? Third Young Master\u2019s chest plate was still serving as the frying pan over the fire\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian demolished the remaining beef slices on her plate in record speed and with absolute calm before standing up and straightening out her clothes.</p><br/><p>As expected, in a short moment, the tent flap was lifted from outside and her visitors poured into the tent.</p><br/><p>The tent wasn\u2019t that big, so there was hardly any space left once everyone had entered.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to the brazier next to Chu Lian the moment they entered the tent, their eyes filled with curiosity and expectation.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu was the first to lose to his curiosity. He strode over to Chu Lian, not forgetting to give her a greeting bow, before asking her with wide, sparkling eyes, \u201cSister-in-Law, what are you cooking now? It smells delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t hold back the twitch in her eyes any longer.</p><br/><p>These gluttons! The first thing on their minds wasn\u2019t asking after her wellbeing, but eyeing the table and plates in front of her\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this really how they should be acting?</p><br/><p>However, Chu Lian couldn\u2019t share her honest thoughts with these gluttons, so she could only summon up her well of patience and reply, \u201cI\u2019m not used to the food here in the army and I had nothing to do, so I made these with my maidservants. They\u2019re just some small snacks. If it seems interesting to you, please feel free to have a taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>That invite was exactly what the gluttons had been waiting for. When they heard her words, their faces lit up with delight. They had been stuck in the meeting in the commander\u2019s tent for almost the entire day. In the afternoon, all they had was just bean paste. They were absolutely starving right now. If not for Chu Lian\u2019s status and gender, they would probably have come charging in to snatch her food when they had smelled that delicious aroma, rather than trying to be polite.</p><br/><p>Sima Hui formed a cupped fist salute with her hands in Chu Lian\u2019s direction. The manly gesture didn\u2019t seem out of place with her military outfit. Instead, it made her seem even more dashing and bold.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonoured Lady Jinyi, my name is Sima Hui. I\u2019ll be troubling you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui was half a head taller than Chu Lian. She had long legs, a narrow waist and a heroic aura. Her eyes were slightly tilted upwards at their corners, giving her sharp features a hint of loveliness. Chu Lian met her eyes and saw the resolution in her gaze, so she bobbed in reply and smiled with good intentions.</p><br/><p>As she expected, Sima Hui wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who would be narrow-minded or a stickler for social conventions.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

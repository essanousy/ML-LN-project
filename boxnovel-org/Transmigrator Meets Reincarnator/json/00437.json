As her gaze swept the room, a book placed on the side table caught her eye.</p><br/><p>That was the book that Xiyan had been using to catalogue Chu Lian\u2019s accessories. Pan Nianzhen\u2019s appearance had been so sudden that she had forgotten about the catalogue, even though she had ordered the servants to keep the jewellery. Xiyan had left it open on a little table near the hearth. It was unfortunate that it caught Pan Nianzhen\u2019s eye.</p><br/><p>At first, Pan Nianzhen had just glanced at it due to curiosity. However, when she read the names of the accessories recorded on the book, she was first startled, before envy and jealousy flooded her heart.</p><br/><p>Golden hairpin with sapphire and jade inlays, Eight Treasure hairpin with pearl chains, dangling hair ornament shaped as a blooming blossom with ruby\u2026 The names of some accessories leaped out at first glance- they sounded like they were worth a few hundred taels at least!</p><br/><p>In Siyang, even the provincial official\u2019s wife didn\u2019t own such jewellery.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was overcome with jealousy. In her mind, Chu Lian was merely the wife of the third young master, but she had so many expensive accessories! What about the wives of the first and second sons then!?</p><br/><p>Xiyan, Senior Servant Liu and the others didn\u2019t notice where Pan Nianzhen\u2019s gaze had been directed. Xiyan continued with a smile, \u201cMiss Pan, please follow this servant, Third Young Madam\u2019s clothes are all in the bedroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian wasn\u2019t home, Xiyan still followed their standard procedures and switched out the clothes in the closet for ones suited for winter.</p><br/><p>Once the closet was opened, it became too dazzling for Pan Nianzhen to behold.</p><br/><p>Her mouth was agape as she looked at the various winter clothes in disbelief. Her eyes were filled with greed.</p><br/><p>When Xiyan looked towards the fragile-looking Miss Pan, she noticed that something was amiss with her gaze. She turned her head to check what she was looking at. When she realised that Miss Pan was eyeing the clothes in the closet, her brows knit together.</p><br/><p>Xiyan suppressed the displeasure in her heart and tried her best to keep up her calm tone, \u201cMiss Pan, Third Young Madam\u2019s winter clothes are all here. These were all newly made this year and Third Young Madam hasn\u2019t worn them yet. Please go ahead and pick a few from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The clothes that Xiyan had pointed at had been made by the seamstresses in the estate and were part of the regular allowance sent to every member of the household. There were six sets in total, all made to Chu Lian\u2019s measurements. There were high-quality dresses, fur-lined jackets, vests and cloaks.</p><br/><p>However, Pan Nianzhen\u2019s eyes landed on another chest of clothes off to the side. The outfits in that chest were just too outstanding. One of the full-length dresses was even decorated with black pearls the size of rice grains. The pearls followed a winding pattern on top of the dark-coloured dress. It was the epitome of understated luxury. Pan Nianzhen couldn\u2019t help pointing at that outfit with her eyes glistening, \u201cI\u2019ll take that set then.</p><br/><p>Xiyan followed where Pan Nianzhen was pointing. The moment she saw the outfit Pan Nianzhen wanted, her expression changed and she took a deep breath. Xiyan used all her patience to explain, \u201cMiss Pan, I truly apologize, the winter clothes in this wardrobe were all bestowed to our Third Young Madam by Princess Wei, we can\u2019t give them to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? Bestowed by Princess Wei?</p><br/><p>Although her hopes had been crushed, Pan Nianzhen refused to give up.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just borrow these and wear them for a bit?\u201d Pan Nianzhen spoke in a slightly whiny tone as if she had been bullied.</p><br/><p>Xiyan was stunned. She didn\u2019t expect this Miss Pan to be so stubborn as she had already stated things very clearly.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei doted on Chu Lian, so she had sent a whole chest of clothes over at the end of the year. The clothes in the closet could all be lent to Miss Pan, but the outfits bestowed by Princess Wei truly couldn\u2019t be lent to her. Their own mistress hadn\u2019t even worn them once yet, so it would be bad if Princess Wei found out that the clothes had been lent to others.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

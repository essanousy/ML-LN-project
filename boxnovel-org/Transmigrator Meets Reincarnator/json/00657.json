Her mind had been on edge the whole day. Now that she finally got to relax, the exhaustion piled up upon her.</p><br/><p>However, the moment she laid down, there was the sound of thunder, and then came the pattering sound of rain.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared blankly at the ceiling. She blinked her almond-shaped eyes several times, then pulled up the blanket to cover her ears in an attempt to isolate herself from the annoying sound of rainfall.</p><br/><p>Wenqing stood to one side, contemplating whether to speak or not. She had already received news of Third Young Master coming over and waiting outside the gates.</p><br/><p>It was evident that Prince and Princess Wei had no intention of keeping He Changdi\u2019s actions from Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>The final say was left to Chu Lian. Even though Wenqing was concerned about the well-being of her master, as a mere servant, it wasn\u2019t her place to say anything.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian reached out and made a gesture for Wenqing to go and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard today, go get some rest too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing sighed inwardly. The quarrel between Third Young Madam and Third Young Master must be really bad this time. Even at this point in their relationship, there were still obstacles between the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis servant will retreat for now. This servant will have a rest on the chaise right outside, please call for this servant if you need anything, Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Wenqing\u2019s footsteps faded away, Chu Lian pulled down the blanket covering her face.</p><br/><p>As she looked at the peaceful turquoise-colored canopy, her mind was filled with chaotic thoughts.</p><br/><p>She forced her eyes shut, but the sounds of the pattering rain and cracking thunder pierced her ears, and felt like hammers slamming down on her heart.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tossed and turned but she just couldn\u2019t fall asleep. All that was on her mind were the words reported by a servant who had come by earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonoured Lady, Marquis Anyuan has come over looking for you. The princess ordered the guards to stop him from entering and the guards have advised him to leave, but it doesn\u2019t seem like Marquis Anyuan intends to do so. He has been standing at the entrance for an hour. Do you have any orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>It had never occured to Chu Lian that it would rain tonight, and that it would be such a heavy downpour.</p><br/><p>That lunatic He Sanlang wouldn\u2019t actually be so silly to stand in front of the gate all night, right?</p><br/><p>At the entrance, there were only small eaves hanging over the door to protect people from the rain.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t he already be soaked by now?</p><br/><p>It was already spring, and summer would soon come, but it was still easy to fall ill by staying out in the rain like this.</p><br/><p>Even though they had Great Doctor Miao, the Great Wu Dynasty wasn\u2019t like the modern times. They didn\u2019t have any advanced medical equipment. Thus, even the smallest cold could end up taking a person\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s thoughts went wild. The more she thought about it, the more uneasy she became.</p><br/><p>The maidservant had said that Laiyue was there as well. That fellow wouldn\u2019t just stand there and watch his master get soaked, right?</p><br/><p>He Sanlang would have to stay by His Majesty\u2019s side as a guard the next morning as well\u2026</p><br/><p>After tossing and turning restlessly in bed for another fifteen minutes, Chu Lian couldn\u2019t continue lying down anymore. She got up and listened to the pouring rain, praying that it would lighten up, but the heavens paid no heed to her wishes. The rain outside didn\u2019t get any softer at all, and was even getting louder instead.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian finally had enough, and shouted for Wenqing who was resting outside.</p><br/><p>Wenqing quickly entered. From her attire, it was obvious that she hadn\u2019t gone to rest at all.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gripped the blanket tightly with both hands, took a deep breath, then ordered, \u201cWenqing, go to the entrance and check if he has left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing\u2019s eyes brightened up. She quickly answered in the affirmative and bowed to Chu Lian, then immediately walked off to complete the task.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian watched as Wenqing left impatiently, and sighed. They had probably guessed that she would be too soft-hearted to ignore this situation.</p><br/><p>Oh well, what\u2019s done is done, She had never had the heart to watch He Changdi suffer anyway.</p><br/><p>At the entrance, the originally suave and charismatic He Sanlang was now so soaked that he looked like a drowned rat.</p><br/><p>The two locks of hair framing his face were now stuck to his face due to the rain, and drops of rain were streaking down his stubborn expression and dripping from his chin.</p><br/><p>He raised one hand to wipe away the rainwater on his face.</p><br/><p>He maintained a frosty expression in the pouring rain, but his back was straighter than ever.</p><br/><p>Even the two guards couldn\u2019t bear to watch him do this to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cMarquis, please come over here for cover. The spring rain is chilly, and it will be easy to fall ill if Marquis stays there.</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t move an inch. It was as if the two guards didn\u2019t even exist.</p><br/><p>The two guards were at a loss for what to do, so they secretly had someone report this to the higher-ups.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the servant who went to pass the message returned and told them to leave Marquis Anyuan alone. As long as Honoured Lady Jinyi remained silent, this would be none of their concern even if he stood there overnight.</p><br/><p>The two guards looked at each other, and had no choice but to keep their mouths shut.</p><br/><p>Laiyue was standing there holding two umbrellas and was incredibly anxious as well. He was completely soaked, and he had tried to persuade Third Young Master to take an umbrella or go back for now, but He Changdi stayed unmoving like a stone statue.</p><br/><p>Like a fool, Laiyue held the umbrellas without opening them, and accompanied his \u2018crazy\u2019 master in front of the entrance.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that these guards refused to let him enter as well, he would have already gone in to look for Third Young Madam with tears in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Right as Laiyue was falling into a daze, he caught sight of someone in his peripheral vision; it was a familiar figure to him.</p><br/><p>He abruptly raised his head, and his eyes met with Wenqing\u2019s searching gaze.</p><br/><p>His eyes immediately brightened up, and he waved at Wenqing from outside the courtyard like an idiot. His smile was so wide that it revealed all of his white teeth.</p><br/><p>Wenqing served Third Young Madam personally. Since she had come here at this time, it had to be by Third Young Madam\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Third Young Master hadn\u2019t gotten soaked for nothing. The rainbow comes after the storm.</p><br/><p>This had truly been an arduous mission.</p><br/><p>Wenqing glared at him, then shifted her gaze to He Changdi. She sized him up, then turned away and left quickly.</p><br/><p>Laiyue moved closer to He Changdi, and said with a silly smile on his face, \u201cThird Young Master, did you see who that was? It was Wenqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi sent a chilly gaze at him, and Laiyue immediately curbed his smile and shut his mouth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There were also parts that were stuck directly to his wounds. Chu Lian clenched her teeth and mustered up the courage to pull it off in one go.</p><br/><p>The unconscious He Sanlang was covered in cold sweat. There was an unnatural flush on his cheeks, and his lips were pale and cracked. These were the signs of a high fever.</p><br/><p>Wenlan ordered a servant to bring in a few more braziers, then placed a towel soaked with cold water on He Changdi\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pursed her lips tightly, holding back her tears with everything she had.</p><br/><p>After cutting for approximately five minutes, she finally managed to cut off the clothing stuck to his wounds, revealing his entire right leg.</p><br/><p>His right leg was badly mangled from thigh to calf,. She couldn\u2019t even see a single patch of clean skin- everything was covered in blood.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had gone through special training for emergency first aid in the wilderness before. Although she couldn\u2019t match the treatment a medical professional might provide, she could still patch up his wounds before a doctor arrived.</p><br/><p>She asked Wenqing and Wenlan to search for some supplies before she began tending to He Changdi\u2019s thigh. Before long, the condition of his thigh and calf was stabilised.</p><br/><p>Those who remained in the room were all Chu Lian\u2019s trusted servants, so nobody questioned Chu Lian\u2019s decisions. Even though Mo Chenggui had tried to object, his objection had already been quelled by Manager Qin.</p><br/><p>By the time Chu Lian finished, an old physician with a snow-white beard was helped in by two guards.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly welcomed him in. This physician was a familiar face. He had been the one to see to the wound on Chu Lian\u2019s ankle, and he was an experienced old physician who was skillful with external wounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, please take a look at my husband\u2019s wounds,\u201d Chu Lian said as she supported the physician to the bed.</p><br/><p>When the old physician saw that the wounds on the patient\u2019s right thigh had already been cleaned, he seemed astonished. \u201cWho tended to these wounds?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question from the unknowing physician lit a fire in Mo Chenggui\u2019s heart. He thought that the physician meant that Chu Lian had made the condition of He Changdi\u2019s wounds even worse. He immediately stood up to face Chu Lian with a fierce glare.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian completely disregarded his angry look. Instead, she focused on suppressing her own anxiety and remaining calm. \u201cSir, it was me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old physician raised his head to glance at Chu Lian. He nodded with approval. \u201cMadam, you\u2019ve done very well. You must have studied a little about medicine before. I didn\u2019t bring any of my assistants in my rush to come here, so I\u2019ll need to trouble you in a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly nodded and took off her loose outer robe, which would only get in the way. She changed into a more flexible tunic.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was stupefied. It was completely out of his expectations that a young lady like Third Young Madam would actually have some medical knowledge at the tender age of sixteen. However, since the old physician had said so, he believed it.</p><br/><p>For a moment, he felt rather guilty.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin glanced at him with contempt. For some reason, Manager Qin just couldn\u2019t get along with Leader Mo.</p><br/><p>He just couldn\u2019t see eye to eye with this old ruffian no matter how much he tried.</p><br/><p>The old physician didn\u2019t like how crowded the room was, so he only allowed Chu Lian and Wenqing to stay while everybody else was chased out of the room.</p><br/><p>After a whole two hours, the old physician finally exited the room with the support of Wenqing, while the weary Chu Lian came out right behind them.</p><br/><p>The moment the door was opened, Mo Chenggui and Manager Qin anxiously went up to them.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui asked apprehensively, \u201cDoctor, how is Third Young Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old physician looked him up and down. When he saw that the middle-aged man also seemed to be covered in wounds, he rattled out a list of complaints. \u201cWere you involved with bringing the patient back here? You, don\u2019t you know how to take care of someone? If that young man in there had stayed on horseback for just half a day longer, you can forget about keeping his right leg! Luckily, your madam arrived just in time to take care of those wounds. Otherwise, even if I were Hua Tuo reborn, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep that leg! A fine young man would have been crippled just like that!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

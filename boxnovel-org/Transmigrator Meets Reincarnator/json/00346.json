In the northern border, it was so cold that spit would turn into ice the moment it hit the ground. The fleece rug and blankets that had originally been placed inside the carriage had been used to replace He Changdi\u2019s bedding, so all that was left were bare wooden boards. Chu Lian wasn\u2019t used to the cold and hard interior yet.</p><br/><p>Wenqing heard the sound of hurried hoofbeats outside the carriage, so she lifted the curtain slightly to peek outside. Her face lit up with happiness and she turned to Chu Lian. While speaking, she adjusted the large fur cloak on her mistress properly. \u201cThird Young Madam, Third Young Master has come to send you off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was still angry at that lunatic husband of hers and had no desire to see him at this point. All she did was harrumph in reaction to Wenqing\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Wenqing started getting anxious when she saw Third Young Madam\u2019s reaction. However, there was nothing she could do.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was intent on stewing in her anger in the carriage. Meanwhile, He Sanlang had never been a man who was good at placating his wife, let alone after reincarnating from his previous life. The thought of shamelessly begging his wife for forgiveness had never even crossed his mind. Thus, he kept his face cold and continued following by Chu Lian\u2019s carriage on his horse, escorting her silently all the way back to the He Estate in Liangzhou City.</p><br/><p>He dismounted from his horse and stood by the carriage. It wasn\u2019t until he finally saw Chu Lian as she was being helped down from the carriage by Wenlan, that his deep, dark gaze finally lit up with some life. He moved forward with some urgency, intending to help Chu Lian, but when he received a fierce glare from his wife in return, he pulled his hand back.</p><br/><p>As he was right now, He Sanlang looked like a poor dog who had been abandoned by his master\u2026</p><br/><p>After Chu Lian glared at him, she simply walked straight into the He Estate without Wenqing and Wenlan\u2019s support, treating He Changdi as if he was thin air.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang stood silently by the entrance of the estate as the cold winter winds blew past.</p><br/><p>The two subordinates who had followed after him lowered their heads with scared looks on their faces, afraid that their captain would turn around to take his anger out on them instead.</p><br/><p>Damn it, which brat had told them that there would be good food to eat if they accompanied the captain to the He Estate!? They were going to kill him when they got back to camp!</p><br/><p>He Changdi continued staring in the direction that Chu Lian had left in, his thin lips pressed tightly together. His hands curled into fists at his side. The small trace of warmth in his eyes disappeared and his expression turned cold and dark.</p><br/><p>Just like this, he stood by the entrance of the estate without going in nor leaving, as if the howling icy winds would be able to calm the swirling emotions in his heart.</p><br/><p>After fifteen minutes, Chu Lian could no longer sit still. She wasn\u2019t the kind of girl to play cold wars with others anyway. She had done so with He Changdi because that fool had deserved it!</p><br/><p>When Wenqing noticed that Third Young Madam seemed a little distracted, she quickly took the chance to ask, \u201cThird Young Madam, we haven\u2019t heard any sound of hoofbeats. It\u2019s still snowing outside right now, wouldn\u2019t it be unbearable to stand out there in the cold? Third Young Master might be sent back out to the frontlines to fight our enemies too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Wenqing could finish speaking, Chu Lian had already interrupted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo out and give him some stuff!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Third Young Madam had finally given in, Wenqing\u2019s face brightened up with joy. She quickly called Wenlan to follow her out to prepare a package. Just as they were about to leave, Chu Lian quickly added on, \u201cDon\u2019t tell him that it was my order! I\u2019m still angry here! And I haven\u2019t forgiven him! It\u2019s just\u2026 for the sake of his efforts on the frontlines.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing resisted the urge to smile and respectfully agreed.</p><br/><p>As Wenqing rushed towards the estate entrance with a package in hand, she spotted Manager Qin standing to one side awkwardly. When Manager Qin noticed her arrival, he reacted as if he had seen his saviour.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Young Master still standing at the entrance?\u201d Wenqing asked in a whisper.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin nodded with a troubled expression. \u201cMiss Wenqing, please try to convince Third Young Master to return. Those two soldiers standing behind Third Young Master look like they\u2019re about to freeze.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing told him to return to the estate first, while she hurried towards the entrance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

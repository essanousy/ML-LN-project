He looked around the courtyard in a panic, but Chu Lian\u2019s figure had long since disappeared.</p><br/><p>Agitated, he roared, \u201cWhere is Third Young Madam?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old soldiers who had been carrying out Manager Qin\u2019s punishment were stricken with terror. Although they were already getting on in age, their hearing was still working fine. They had heard Third Young Madam\u2019s words just now. Manager Qin had gone out to find these planks of fir for the sake of saving the fifty thousand border troops. However, they had not only blamed him unjustly for his actions, but they had also almost beaten him to death\u2026</p><br/><p>When the soldiers thought of what they had almost wrought, cold sweat ran down their backs, regardless of the fact that it was the middle of a cold winter day. The soldiers stared at Mo Chenggui with condemning gazes and said, \u201cBrother Mo, Third Young Madam is already gone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui ran after her without thinking. Although he didn\u2019t quite dare to trust her yet, since Chu Lian had spoken, that meant that there was hope- even if he had no idea how fir wood, of all things, would be able to save the troops.</p><br/><p>The people of the Great Wu Dynasty placed great emphasis on keeping to one\u2019s word. This wasn\u2019t the modern era where even the most binding contracts could be broken. This was an era where a promise was worth a thousand taels of gold. All families, no matter their size or influence, would keep the promises made by their ancestors for generations upon generations.</p><br/><p>Thus, when Chu Lian made her outrageous claim in front of Mo Chenggui, he didn\u2019t have an ounce of suspicion that she was spinning up a story. Since she had said it was so, then there was definitely hope!</p><br/><p>It was indeed so. The old carpenter had already finished building Chu Lian\u2019s idea. It was just a matter of time before they were able to put it to use.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Mo Chenggui had instantly forgotten all the disdain he had for Chu Lian. He chased right after her without any shame at all.</p><br/><p>When the old soldiers saw their Leader Mo acting so shamelessly, they wanted to turn their cheeks and pretend they didn\u2019t know him.</p><br/><p>This was entirely different from what they had imagined would happen!</p><br/><p>O Great Leader, shouldn\u2019t you be scolding her right back with anger and arrogance?</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui ran off quickly, leaving a huge mess behind him!</p><br/><p>Manager Qin and the manservants were still tied up, and there was still a pile of fir wood at the side.</p><br/><p>One of the old soldiers hurriedly ran off to ask about what they were supposed to do. Mo Chenggui then ordered them to untie Manager Qin and help send the fir to Chu Lian\u2019s courtyard.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan stood at the entrance of the side courtyard with his guards. When he heard what was going on, he shook his head. Even he had been frightened by Chu Lian\u2019s words just now. He had thought to come out to mediate at first, but who knew that the whole scene would come to such a dramatic end?</p><br/><p>Honoured Lady Jinyi was really full of surprises.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, will you step in to this matter?\u201d One of the guards next to Tang Yan inquired.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan shook his head with a smile. \u201cThis matter has already been settled. Didn\u2019t you hear? Honoured Lady has already found a solution. Come on, let\u2019s go and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yan turned and started walking towards Chu Lian\u2019s courtyard as well.</p><br/><p>When he reached the entrance, he was met with the sight of Mo Chenggui being blocked from entering the courtyard. When he saw the old soldier pacing back and forth at the entrance without care for the feather-sized snow falling from the sky, Tang Yan hesitated before going up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Mo, why are you standing out here? Why don\u2019t you go in and take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leader Mo hated literary officials like Tang Yan the most. After glaring at him, he continued pacing with his hands behind his back.</p><br/><p>Tang Yan didn\u2019t mind the frosty reception. He turned towards the entrance and was about to stride right in when Li Xing used a sword to block his path.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Tang, please stop right there. Honoured Lady has given us instructions to prevent anyone from entering, with the exception of the people who work in this courtyard.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

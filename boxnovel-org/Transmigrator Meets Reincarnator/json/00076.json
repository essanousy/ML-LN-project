She had already been up for a while.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian reached Qingxi Hall, the matriarch had just finished her breakfast.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian greeted her in the traditional manner of a junior family member, and Matriarch He waved her forward with upturned, smiling eyes. \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, come sit by Grandmother\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sat down on the low stool a step below the matriarch. She looked at Matriarch He as she asked, \u201cGrandmother, is there any news from my husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had just been married to He Changdi for a few days and the two of them hadn\u2019t consummated their marriage. He Changdi had even treated her with the equivalent of a cold shoulder. No matter how outstanding his looks were, Chu Lian had no feelings for him at all.</p><br/><p>She was simply acting the part of a devoted wife for the matriarch\u2019s sake.</p><br/><p>Although she didn\u2019t like He Changdi\u2019s actions, she liked the matriarch. Since the second day of her marriage, during the tea ceremony, she could see the genuine care and concern this old granny held for her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wouldn\u2019t let anyone who treated her well be sad.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He sighed and stroked Chu Lian\u2019s soft head of hair. \u201cThat Sanlang is really\u2026 Sanlang\u2019s wife, please don\u2019t worry too much about him. I\u2019ve already asked Dalang to send people out with inquiries. There\u2019ll be news soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian obediently nodded; she didn\u2019t look like this news particularly surprised her, or was anything really special. However, it was this lack of expression that caused the matriarch\u2019s heart to ache in sympathy.</p><br/><p>She had been the one to plead with the empress dowager for a girl from House Ying, but now, that girl had to suffer living like a widow while her husband was still alive. Thus, she felt a little more guilty compared to the other members of the family.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed the gloom creeping onto the matriarch\u2019s face and hurriedly tried to change the topic. \u201cGrandmother, what did you have for breakfast today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after she asked, Chu Lian almost blushed with shame. What was wrong with her? The only topic she could come up with was related to food?</p><br/><p>However, she couldn\u2019t take back her words, so the only thing she could do was suppress her blush and look up at Matriarch He. The matriarch could see the embarrassment on Chu Lian\u2019s face, so she burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You didn\u2019t have enough to eat in your own courtyard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blushed at Matriarch He\u2019s teasing. Of course she had eaten her fill! Half a basket of soup dumplings had gone into her stomach! Even now, Chu Lian still felt bloated.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was already old. Her daughters had already left the estate a long time ago, and her daughter-in-law had given birth to three sons. When Madam Zou had married into the estate, she had already been over twenty years old. Matriarch He hadn\u2019t had the company of young ladies around the age of fifteen like Chu Lian in a long time, so she cherished seeing her innocent reactions even more.</p><br/><p>When she saw that Chu Lian was already flushed and didn\u2019t know how to answer, the smile on her face grew. \u201cGrandmother doesn\u2019t have a very good appetite in the summer. I only ate half a bowl of red bird\u2019s nest. When you return to your courtyard, I\u2019ll let Senior Servant Liu bring half a kilogram of it for you later. You\u2019re still growing at your age, so you should make sure you have enough nutrients.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian had never eaten red bird\u2019s nest before, as an experienced gourmet enthusiast, she knew that red bird\u2019s nest was the best quality of bird\u2019s nest available. Most of the nobility in the Great Wu Dynasty ate white bird\u2019s nest, two whole grades lower than red bird\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s red bird nest probably couldn\u2019t be bought with money, and most likely came from the palace. The matriarch was good friends with the empress dowager, so it had probably been a gift.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t dare to accept something that the empress dowager had given to Matriarch He.</p><br/><p>She quickly shook her head. \u201cGrandmother, there\u2019s no need for that. My body\u2019s perfectly healthy! If I take in more nutrients, I\u2019ll get fat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about getting fat with such a tiny figure?\u201d Matriarch He smiled broadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, if you really want to give it away, why not give it to Mother instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He froze for a moment and sighed. \u201cChild, you\u2019re always thinking of others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked up at Matriarch He\u2019s affectionate expression. \u201cMother is my husband\u2019s very own mother. How could Mother be counted as an outsider?\u201d</p><br/><p>Warmth suffused Matriarch He\u2019s heart and she poked Chu Lian\u2019s little nose. \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, you really are such a good child. Alright, Grandmother will send some red bird\u2019s nest to your mother. You had better take some back with you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the matriarch had already put it this way, it would be unreasonable if Chu Lian continued declining.</p><br/><p>Eldest Young Madam had arrived outside sometime while they were talking. She just so happened to overhear Matriarch He\u2019s words upon entering. She lowered her head and frowned a little.</p><br/><p>Since Madam Zou\u2019s back was to the light, no one noticed the expression on her face.</p><br/><p>A maidservant lifted up the curtain at the entrance of the room and let Madam Zou in.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother.\u201d After Madam Zou bobbed in greeting, she sat at Matriarch He\u2019s other side.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He smiled as she looked at Madam Zou. \u201cDalang\u2019s wife, why have you come here so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no change in the expression on Madam Zou\u2019s face at all. The corner of her lips lifted elegantly. \u201cGrandmother, have you forgotten? It\u2019s rest day for all the stewards in our estate today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every day, Madam Zou had to listen to all the stewards of every courtyard in the estate make their report. She would only come to Qingxi Hall to greet the matriarch when she was done. After that, she would visit her mother-in-law.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s the sixteenth today. Grandmother\u2019s forgotten all about the date.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou exchanged small talk with the matriarch for some time, but seeing that Matriarch He didn\u2019t mention the red bird\u2019s nest at all, she couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

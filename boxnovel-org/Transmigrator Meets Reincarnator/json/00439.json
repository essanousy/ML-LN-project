She stood up to give her greetings, \u201cEldest Madam, how did you come to be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying had recovered her senses by now. She hid the greed in her eyes and raised her chin, \u201cI was just taking a walk around since I was bored. Why? Are you trying to pry into my business?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, Eldest Madam. If Eldest Madam wishes to take a stroll, this servant will arrange for some of the brighter maidservants to accompany you. Although it\u2019s winter, there are still some scenic areas around our estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying could sense that this handmaid Muxiang was more stoic and stubborn. She thought for a bit before replying, \u201cI won\u2019t trouble you. I\u2019ll go over to the matriarch, continue with your task!\u201d</p><br/><p>Muxiang escorted Eldest Madam to the door before turning back to deal with the skiving maidservant guarding the door.</p><br/><p>The little maidservant trembled and pleaded for mercy, but Muxiang\u2019s face was contorted into a fierce expression.</p><br/><p>Another maidservant standing at the side couldn\u2019t hold back her own tremors upon seeing Muxiang\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>Back in Liangzhou on the night of New Year\u2019s Eve, the guests who had come to the He Estate were now seated together in the parlour after eating their fill at the feast. They stayed up to usher in the New Year until it was past midnight. Chu Lian then ordered the servants to bring them to some rooms to rest.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian returned to her own little courtyard and placed all the red packets and one purse she had received that night on the table. She sat next to the table and opened up the red packets using the faint light of the lanterns around her.</p><br/><p>Opening these red packets was like opening presents. The most enjoyable part was the surprise right before opening the envelopes. She hadn\u2019t gotten any red packets for a long time back in the modern world, so she wanted to experience the delight of it again.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, although it was already the New Year, He Sanlang was still pulling a long face in his room, causing the whole room to be enveloped in cold.</p><br/><p>Laiyue stood to one side with a conflicted expression- he didn\u2019t know whether he should sit or stand.</p><br/><p>He rubbed his hands together and said, \u201cThird Young Master, it\u2019s already late. Your wounds aren\u2019t completely healed yet, why don\u2019t you sleep earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t look at him. Instead, he showed his palm to Laiyue, \u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue quickly pulled out a thin and exquisite wooden box out of his clothes and offered it up to his young master with both hands, \u201cThird Young Master, it\u2019s right here. This servant kept it close at all times, this servant didn\u2019t dare to be careless with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi took the wooden box without another word.</p><br/><p>An idea flared to life in Laiyue\u2019s mind and he coughed lightly. He bent over and whispered a suggestion in He Changdi\u2019s ear, \u201cThird Young Master, it\u2019s a matter of course for a couple to be together. Since it\u2019ll be the first day of the new year tomorrow, it seems like you should spend the night with Third Young Madam no matter what. Although Third Young Madam hasn\u2019t said anything, she surely has you in mind. However, she\u2019s still young so she\u2019s likely a little too shy to mention anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s handsome face finally melted a little upon hearing Laiyue\u2019s words. His slender fingers gripped the wooden box. After a short pause, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll head over to your young madam\u2019s room tonight then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elation showed on Laiyue\u2019s face. When He Changdi turned his gaze away, he quickly wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and heaved a sigh of relief inwardly. He thought to himself, \u2018Sheesh, I\u2019ve finally pushed this load over to Third Young Madam. Now no matter what Third Young Master\u2019s mood turns out to be, it won\u2019t be my problem anymore!\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to be a manservant. Not only did Laiyue have to look after his master\u2019s daily needs, he also had to keep guessing at what his master wanted and help him out of awkward social situations. If things continued in this manner, his lifespan would probably be shortened by at least ten years.</p><br/><p>Thus, Laiyue quickly ordered some servants to carry He Sanlang over to Chu Lian\u2019s courtyard. Once they set their young master down, Laiyue made his escape.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was still happily opening her red packets in her room! When she heard noises from outside, she found it strange and called for her maidservants. Wenqing came running in and reported, \u201cThird Young Madam, Third Young Master is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gaped speechlessly. It was already so late. Why had he come over to her place instead of resting comfortably in his bed?</p><br/><p>She set down the purse that she had been about to open- the one that Sima Hui had given her, and followed Wenqing to the outer room.</p><br/><p>He Changdi wasn\u2019t able to walk on his own yet, so he had been carried over to Chu Lian\u2019s courtyard by a few of the family\u2019s soldiers. Right now, he had been set on the hearth bed in the outer room.</p><br/><p>He was dressed in a black fur-lined cloak that accentuated the current pallor of his handsome face. His long and narrow eyes were half-lidded and his lips were pressed together. He was lying sideways on the hearth. Due to his height, his long legs stuck out a little past the length of the hearth bed, so he had propped them up on the armrest. His slender fingers were playing with the green jade ring on his left thumb.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian realised that He Changdi would play with the ring whenever he was in deep thought, ever since she had unwittingly given him the jade ring.</p><br/><p>Stunned as she was by his otherworldly looks, Chu Lian stood by the door in a daze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Without her noticing, even her ears had flushed red with embarrassment. However, when she heard his mocking reprimand, she just couldn\u2019t muster up any energy to retort.</p><br/><p>That\u2026 It\u2019s not like she wanted to step on this trap\u2026 It\u2019s not her fault\u2026 Okay\u2026</p><br/><p>Dejected, Chu Lian defended herself\u2026 in her mind.</p><br/><p>In actual fact, her external appearance and internal thoughts were completely opposite.</p><br/><p>Her head was lowered, her long eyelashes trembling as they covered her eyes like little fans. She looked extremely pitiful, like she was afraid of getting scolded.</p><br/><p>However, He Sanlang\u2019s determination to reprimand her hadn\u2019t decreased one bit despite the guilt and self-blame she was demonstrating.</p><br/><p>He harrumphed inwardly. This wicked woman was too used to acting pitiful.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian snatched the hem of her skirt from his hands and covered up her legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 How could you do that!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s gloom and doom hadn\u2019t dissipated at all. His voice turned harder and colder as he disregarded Chu Lian\u2019s retort and warned, \u201cMove your hands away!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fire had been stoked in Chu Lian\u2019s heart thanks to this man\u2019s icy, forceful attitude. Her cheeks puffed up and she met his eyes directly in a spurt of courage. \u201cMister, men and women should keep their distance! I can do it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, Chu Lian pulled down her skirt tightly before glaring up at the bearded man, her eyes full of stubborn determination.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was instantly filled with anger.</p><br/><p>Heh! Men and women should keep their distance!</p><br/><p>She was trying to use that silly rule on her own husband!</p><br/><p>Very well!</p><br/><p>Then he was going to see how capable this wicked woman was today!</p><br/><p>He Changdi released her ankle and stood up. He walked off to one side and even turned his back towards her a little, as if just the distance wasn\u2019t enough- he also had to avert his gaze.</p><br/><p>Without that beardy staring at her, Chu Lian was much more relaxed since she no longer felt so on edge. She sneaked a peek in the beardy\u2019s direction, only to see that his tall back was ramrod straight. After making sure that he really wasn\u2019t looking this way anymore, she reached out to pull aside the cloth covering her trapped ankle.</p><br/><p>Just that slight movement of her body pained her enough that she sucked in her breath.</p><br/><p>Her attention had been drawn away by that beardy earlier. It was only now when she looked at her wound that the pain returned with double or triple the force.</p><br/><p>She slowly shifted into a more comfortable position before she tried to pry the animal trap apart using her hands.</p><br/><p>However, she quickly realised that this animal trap wasn\u2019t as easy to open as it first seemed to be. Since her ankle was trapped, she couldn\u2019t really use all of her strength. Furthermore, the animal trap was clamped on too tightly. She tried a few more times, but the trap was unmovable. Conversely, she had become fatigued from her exertions and the pain she was suffering.</p><br/><p>She kept sucking in her breath due to the pain. Her gaze hesitantly turned to the bearded man not too far away. She wanted to ask for his help, but when she thought back to how she had refused his help earlier, she just couldn\u2019t set down her pride to do so.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian scolded herself in her mind in her frustration.</p><br/><p>Although He Sanlang was standing to one side and pretending not to care, he had been watching Chu Lian from the corner of his eyes.</p><br/><p>He watched as that tiny yet stubborn figure gritted her teeth while trying to pry off the animal trap, her eyelashes already wet with tears from her struggles.</p><br/><p>Those little hands, reddened from the cold, were gripping the two sides of the animal trap so fiercely that her knuckles had turned white. However, that steel trap remained clamped onto her leg without budging. In the end, she weakly let go of the trap. Her leg was still caught in it, and all she had to show for her efforts was more blood seeping out from her wound.</p><br/><p>The knot in He Changdi\u2019s heart tightened and he could no longer continue standing still. He berated himself for striking a compromise with her and forgetting his original purpose.</p><br/><p>He ignored all of the wicked woman\u2019s protests and grabbed hold of Chu Lian\u2019s hands with one of his arms. He stuck so close to her that he could feel her breath ghosting over his face. When he spoke, his slightly husky voice carried an undertone of restraint as he warned her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move, or you\u2019ll never use this leg of yours again!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

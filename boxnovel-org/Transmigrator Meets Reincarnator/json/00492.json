Why did he bring back three young men along with their son? Furthermore, their identities weren\u2019t ordinary.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s arrival didn\u2019t surprise Chu Lian much as he had mentioned that he would come to pick her up after settling his business with the Left Military Guards. But how had Xiao Bojian come into the picture?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s features tensed up subconsciously and there was an extra spark of guarded caution in her eyes.</p><br/><p>It had been about half a year since Xiao Bojian had last seen Chu Lian. The moment he entered the parlour, his gaze was drawn uncontrollably to Chu Lian\u2019s figure. His gloomy eyes were like those of a desperate man who had found an oasis in the desert, glittering with excitement.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for his extreme self-control, he might have actually run up to her the moment he spotted her.</p><br/><p>He murmured her name in his heart as the hands hidden under his sleeves formed into fists.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had been completely focused on Xiao Bojian\u2019s movements while standing next to him, so he had naturally noticed the changes in him. Luckily, Chu Lian hadn\u2019t welcomed Xiao Bojian\u2019s gaze and she even had a disgusted and guarded look in her eyes. Otherwise, He Sanlang might actually have spit up blood from the anger.</p><br/><p>Although five new people had entered the parlour at the same time, the atmosphere took on a strange air. There was an awkward silence no one could deal with.</p><br/><p>Prince Wei glanced at them with a hint of a smile, as if he wasn\u2019t affected by the weird atmosphere at all.</p><br/><p>Knowing that his wife was surely puzzled over his guests, he quickly walked over to Princess Wei\u2019s side. He took the master seat and explained, \u201cI was at the Left Military Guards to handle some business today and I happened to bump into these fine young men. Ah-tai was there as well. I heard from Ah-tai that Jinyi was here, so I decided to bring them over here for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Prince Wei and his wife exchanged looks. After so many years of marriage, they were able to read each other\u2019s intentions just from looking at each other.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei looked at the young men before her with a composed and dignified smile, \u201cWell, since that\u2019s the case and it\u2019s already getting dark, let\u2019s start dinner! You\u2019ve lucked out today, Duanjia and Jinyi spent most of the day making tonight\u2019s roast duck. Even the palace hasn\u2019t served such a dish before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Lu Tai\u2019s brows raised in interest. Jinyi\u2019s skill in cooking was widely acknowledged. He had gone to Guilin Restaurant once before, and the food there was indeed better than the imperial kitchen\u2019s. It was addictive from the first bite!</p><br/><p>Roast duck? Although Yuehong Restaurant had roast duck too, he felt that something that Chu Lian had made personally would probably be better.</p><br/><p>He Erlang was a simple man who had never been very interested in good food, but upon hearing that Royal Princess Duanjia had done half the work for the dish, he was starting to look forward to it as well.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s face turned black, he obviously wasn\u2019t happy about this.</p><br/><p>If his wife cooked for Prince Wei and Princess Wei alone, then she was simply showing filial piety to her elders and it was part of her obligations. After all, Princess Wei had showed care and concern for his wife. However, the fact that the dish that his wife had personally cooked was going to be shared with Royal Prince Lu Tai, and above all, that damned Xiao Bojian, made him extremely unhappy.</p><br/><p>The jealousy in He Changdi\u2019s heart was hitting its peak. He wanted to cast Xiao Bojian out from the estate on the spot.</p><br/><p>The gloominess on Xiao Bojian\u2019s fine features faded a little upon hearing this. He sent a tender look at Chu Lian. There were many layers of unsaid emotions in that one stifling look.</p><br/><p>How wonderful, he thought. He had never expected to have another opportunity to taste Lian\u2019er\u2019s cooking again.</p><br/><p>With such sweet thoughts occupying Xiao Bojian\u2019s mind, he completely ignored He Changdi\u2019s ice-cold glare.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

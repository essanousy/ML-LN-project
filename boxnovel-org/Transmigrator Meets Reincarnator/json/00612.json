They were all crowding over at Zhuque Gate. It also just so happened that House Zheng\u2019s carriage was right next to theirs. When he turned, he noticed that Heir Zheng was about to disembark his carriage.</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng noticed the couple as well, and took the initiative to greet them, \u201cMarquis Anyuan, Honoured Lady Jinyi, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi nodded towards Heir Zheng with a chilly and unsociable countenance, while Chu Lian smiled at Heir Zheng and returned the greeting.</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng seemed to have something to say as his mouth opened, but before he could speak a word, He Changdi let the curtains of their carriage back down.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng: \u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked speechlessly at her lunatic husband.</p><br/><p>She softly said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Heir Zheng obviously wanted to speak, can\u2019t you put the curtain back down after the conversation is over?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi coldly turned his head to face Chu Lian and asked, \u201cWhat rank are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was flabbergasted. This fellow was changing topics too quickly, he hadn\u2019t even answered her question, yet he had already presented her with another.</p><br/><p>\u201cA second rank Marchioness.\u201d Chu Lian subconsciously answered.</p><br/><p>Although she was still Honoured Lady Jinyi and it was a title bestowed by the Emperor, the honoured lady title was merely a fifth-ranked title. It was a far cry from a second-ranked marchioness. Thus, when in gatherings in the palace or daily social interactions, she would automatically assume the title with the highest rank.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Chu Lian was attending the banquet in the palace with her status as Marchioness Anyuan, and not Honoured Lady Jinyi.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s tone became increasingly displeased, \u201cWhat did he just call you? Honoured Lady Jinyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026</p><br/><p>She had finally learned why this lunatic He Sanlang was being so rude. It was because he didn\u2019t like how others addressed her\u2026</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng hadn\u2019t done it on purpose, right? Maybe he had just called her Honoured Lady Jinyi out of habit.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glared at him.</p><br/><p>Their carriage was well and truly stuck here. They had no choice but to get off.</p><br/><p>He Changdi first leapt off the carriage, then supported Chu Lian as she got down by stepping on a stool.</p><br/><p>Hidden by the wide sleeves of his robes, He Sanlang held Chu Lian\u2019s little hand as they walked towards Count Jing\u2019an\u2019s carriage.</p><br/><p>One was tall and wide while the other was short and slender, so they looked strangely matching when they stood together.</p><br/><p>What He Sanlang and Chu Lian didn\u2019t know was that Xiao Bojian was nearby and looking in their direction with his hands behind his back. He had a sinister expression on as he looked at He Changdi with jealousy and hatred.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian got off the carriage, her soft and tender lips looked a little swollen. When Xiao Bojian noticed this little detail, he almost crushed his own fingers in anger.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath, before he turned away and walked towards Zhuque Gate.</p><br/><p>One glanced at Chu Lian\u2019s direction, then quickly kept up with his master.</p><br/><p>Outside Zhuque Gate, Chu Lian bumped into Old Duchess Zheng and Lady Yang.</p><br/><p>The three families walked towards Taixuan Gate together, where the male guests separated from the female guests.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian supported Countess Jing\u2019an as they were led alongside Old Duchess Zheng and Lady Yang and the other female guests towards the imperial gardens within the inner palace.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had come to the imperial gardens before, but this time, the imperial gardens looked nothing like before.</p><br/><p>A majority of the female guests were led by the maidservants to the halls beside the imperial gardens to rest.</p><br/><p>The moment Chu Lian arrived, she began looking for Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia.</p><br/><p>As expected, she managed to find the two of them, surrounded by people.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian helped her mother-in-law over to greet Princess Wei.</p><br/><p>A while later, the banquet of the Thousand Blessings Festival began.</p><br/><p>While Chu Lian was a second-ranked marchioness, she wasn\u2019t given a seat at the front, and was instead sat by Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s side, which was somewhere in the middle.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia sat at the very front with other high-ranked noble ladies.</p><br/><p>As they sat in a very conspicuous position, Chu Lian was able to see them just by raising her head a little.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia was even specially seated beside the Empress Dowager.</p><br/><p>Halfway through the banquet, Chu Lian raised her head and noticed that there was a palace maid whispering something towards Royal Princess Duanjia. Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s expression immediately changed, and she then got up and stealthily left the banquet.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Royal Princess Duanjia didn\u2019t even bring along any of her trusted handmaids with her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian frowned. She felt that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei sat facing in a different direction from Royal Princess Duanjia, so if she didn\u2019t deliberately turn to look, she wouldn\u2019t have noticed what happened to her daughter at all.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hesitated for a moment, before leaning over to her mother-in-law\u2019s side to excuse herself quietly. She then stood up and quickly led Wenqing and Wenlan in the direction that Royal Princess Duanjia had left in.</p><br/><p>When they got out of the banquet hall, Chu Lian sternly commanded Wenlan, \u201cGo inform Princess Wei that Royal Princess Duanjia left the hall alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, she instructed Wenqing, \u201cWenqing, follow me, and keep your guard up at all times.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying her piece, Chu Lian and Wenlan went their separate ways and disappeared off into the darkness in the imperial gardens.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

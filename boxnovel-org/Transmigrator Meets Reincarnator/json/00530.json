The discontentment in her slowly faded away and the impulse that had filled her head dissipated. When she finally regained her calm, Chu Lian suddenly realised that He Changdi had derailed the conversation completely!</p><br/><p>She had been intending to have a serious discussion with him and make him realise his mistakes. How on earth had it turned into asking if he believed her about the letter and the jade amulet?</p><br/><p>Thinking back on it carefully, she wasn\u2019t the one at fault for the letter or the jade pendant! She was the innocent victim here!</p><br/><p>Once she had thought it through, Chu Lian quickly pushed He Sanlang away and glared at him with her clear, almond-shaped eyes.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang lowered his head to meet his wife eye-to-eye. Upon seeing her eyes clear without any of the anxiety and impatience from before, he realised that Chu Lian had realised what he just did.</p><br/><p>He looked away and said, \u201cAhem. Lian\u2019er, how I acted after we returned from Prince Wei\u2019s estate was entirely my fault, I apologise.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time, He Sanlang had stopped trying to avoid the topic and had actually admitted to his mistake.</p><br/><p>Although his apology was rather vague, it was already a huge step forward that he had admitted fault to this degree, especially considering his awkward personality. Chu Lian knew that she shouldn\u2019t push him too hard for now. Rome hadn\u2019t been built in a day after all.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian believed that their understanding of each other would naturally deepen over time as long as they could live together harmoniously.</p><br/><p>By then, these mysterious problems wouldn\u2019t need to be resolved at all, as they wouldn\u2019t even exist.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had never admitted to his mistakes in such a straightforward manner before. When he finished apologising, his ears even turned red without his knowledge.</p><br/><p>Staring at his stiff expression, Chu Lian couldn\u2019t help bursting into a wide grin. She reached out with her fair fingers and touched He Sanlang\u2019s flushed ears.</p><br/><p>They were hot to the touch and were at a much higher temperature than the rest of his body. He Changdi\u2019s earlobes had always been sensitive, so having it touched by his lover made him stiffen up. All of the surplus blood in his body gathered into a certain area.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt took so much to get you to admit your mistake. Also, don\u2019t go around getting jealous for no reason, I don\u2019t have any relationship with Xiao Bojian at all!\u201d Chu Lian declared to He Sanlang in a serious tone.</p><br/><p>He Changdi wrapped both arms around her and pulled her into an even closer embrace. The rigid tension that had filled his body slowly drifted away from having her soft figure in his arms. He sulked a little as he said, \u201cI know that I shouldn\u2019t be jealous, but I can\u2019t help it. The way Xiao Bojian looked at you didn\u2019t help that either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian rolled her eyes. She was on the verge of suffocating from all this injustice being piled upon her. What could she even do about it if someone looked at her funny?!</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian wasn\u2019t some random commoner, so she couldn\u2019t just lash out at him in the open or dig out his eyes\u2026 He Sanlang\u2019s jealousy was completely unreasonable.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s hand was caressing her petite back even as he continued sulking, \u201cYou\u2019re MY wife! Anyway, other men aren\u2019t allowed to look at you in such a manner at all. Just you wait, I definitely won\u2019t let Xiao Bojian off.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Chu Lian\u2019s lips twitched. She didn\u2019t feel like replying to He Changdi\u2019s pointless proclamation. In any case, she didn\u2019t care about what happened to Xiao Bojian. If He Changdi really had the ability to drag Xiao Bojian down from his high horse, she would actually support her lunatic husband in doing so.</p><br/><p>Now that they had resolved all the misunderstandings between them, the couple had naturally became closer as a result.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian frowned and declared fiercely, \u201cHe Changdi, you\u2019re not allowed to brood so much on your thoughts in the future. I can\u2019t always guess your meaning. If you\u2019re feeling uneasy, you have to let me know.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

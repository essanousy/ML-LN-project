When he turned to his side, he reached out for the warm body that was usually beside him. The emptiness that met his arm startled He Changdi awake.</p><br/><p>He stared at the bed curtains for a few seconds before realising that this wasn\u2019t his bedroom in Songtao Court and that Chu Lian wasn\u2019t by his side right now.</p><br/><p>An irritable heat was building up within him. He tossed and turned, but he couldn\u2019t sleep. His mind was full of Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Finally, he ended up flipping the blankets aside and getting off the bed.</p><br/><p>The night was quiet. Even the manservant who was supposed to be on duty through the night was sound asleep in the side room.</p><br/><p>He Changdi walked over to the window and opened it. He somersaulted out easily and rushed straight for Songtao Court.</p><br/><p>The moment he entered Songtao Court through the window, he was stopped by a soft voice, \u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing dashed over, only to see He Changdi sitting on the window sill, in the middle of breaking into his own room. The corner of her mouth twitched uncontrollably and she set down her raised sword. She greeted him with a bob, \u201cThird Young Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi dismissed her with a wave of his hand and finished entering the bedroom, closing the window on the way.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was in the middle of some sweet dreams when something caught her and tightened around her.</p><br/><p>She turned around and faced He Changdi, trying to push the thing holding onto her away.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s eyes were like black holes in the darkness, as bottomless and impenetrable as a deep lake.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Chu Lian was still sleeping, so she couldn\u2019t see that his eyes were hazy with desire.</p><br/><p>He Changdi traced the profile of Chu Lian\u2019s face with his fingers, but it only made the heat within him worse.</p><br/><p>He buried his head into the crook of her shoulder and called her name, \u201cLian\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian usually slept like a log, and this night was no exception. When she was trapped in his tight embrace, all she did was struggle perfunctorily twice. The moment she found that her struggles were useless, she gave up and let He Changdi do as he wanted. Perhaps due to the familiar scent around her, she relaxed more and even reached out to hug He Changdi\u2019s narrow waist.</p><br/><p>The fire burning in He Sanlang\u2019s heart was becoming unbearable. He kissed the sensitive back of Chu Lian\u2019s ear, huffing out his breath over her soft, little earlobe. His pants were starting to become heavier.</p><br/><p>His hands roamed freely over Chu Lian\u2019s body until she finally awoke.</p><br/><p>When she first opened her eyes, a sleepy haze still covered them. It was when her top was suddenly taken away that she immediately came to her senses.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang could tell that she had woken up, so he covered her lips with his own and started plundering with his tongue.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian made some muffled sounds, intending to protest, but she soon realised that He Changdi was especially forceful tonight. He wouldn\u2019t let her retreat at all.</p><br/><p>She was soon teased to the point of wanting.</p><br/><p>When He Sanlang finally entered her, forcefully and mercilessly, Chu Lian felt like her waist was about to break. However, no matter how much she pleaded, it was no use.</p><br/><p>An hour later, the bedroom finally quietened down again.</p><br/><p>Wenqing had remained on duty in the side room at first, but later on, she had quietly slipped away\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was extremely put out. Her throat was hoarse from her cries and she didn\u2019t even know what day it was.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until He Changdi carried her into the bathtub that she regained her senses.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang used a soft cloth to clean his wife\u2019s body. Chu Lian was sprawled against his chest without even the strength to move a single finger. She suddenly bit harshly on He Changdi\u2019s shoulder, leaving two neat rows of teeth marks on the muscles there.</p><br/><p>She complained with her hoarse voice, \u201cHe Changdi! You\u2019re actually a huge pervert, aren\u2019t you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang didn\u2019t mind whatever his wife called him. He chuckled lowly and whispered teasingly into her ear, \u201cHaven\u2019t I serviced you enough? I thought all your energy should have been used up by now?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Instead, his curiosity was like a million cat claws scratching at the walls of his heart. He couldn\u2019t sit still any longer and tried to urge He Changdi on. \u201cBrother He, what are you in a daze for? Quick, open it and see what\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>With such a nice box, surely it wouldn\u2019t turn out to be jewellery? He really couldn\u2019t think of an accessory that a man would wear.</p><br/><p>For He Changdi, it was impossible to think with such a noisy guy right next to him. Thus, he abandoned his train of thought and turned his focus to the box. It couldn\u2019t be opened straightforwardly. He Changdi located the hidden mechanism and pressed down, releasing the lock. The exquisitely fragrant rosewood box popped open with a clack.</p><br/><p>Nestled within the dark red silk-lined box was a dark green piece of jade in the shape of a thumb ring. Its vibrant colour and glossy surface were a testament to its quality; it even seemed to glow in the light.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Hongyu didn\u2019t understand the finer points of jade quality, he could tell with one glance that something of this colour and texture was definitely high-quality. Furthermore, as a military man, Xiao Hongyu could immediately tell what the item was.</p><br/><p>\u201cA thumb ring!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lowest ranked foot soldiers of the Great Wu Dynasty were given bows and arrows. Thus, thumb rings were something that almost every soldier would use.</p><br/><p>Some of the standard thumb rings would have grooves to help with holding the bow string. The most common type of thumb rings were made of elk horn and were rather cheap in the Great Wu Dynasty.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu was a little jealous upon seeing He Changdi\u2019s gift. The thumb ring he was wearing now was only made of elk horn; he certainly didn\u2019t own any made out of jade. How nice it was to have a wife!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother He, quick, put it on and see if it fits!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi stared at the green jade thumb ring for a moment, but instead of putting it on, he closed the lid and didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu immediately grew anxious. \u201cBrother He, aren\u2019t you going to try it on?\u201d When that didn\u2019t work, Xiao Hongyu smiled and then began to cajol, \u201cBrother He, if you\u2019re not going to use it, then why don\u2019t you lend it to me? The one I\u2019m using is just made of elk horn. It\u2019s not really good and it usually rubs against my skin. See, I\u2019m getting a blister on my thumb from it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi gripped the wooden box in his hands and cast a cool look at the shameless Xiao Hongyu. \u201cWho said I\u2019m not going to wear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he took out the green Hetian jade thumb ring and put it onto his right thumb.</p><br/><p>Although He Sanlang regularly practised martial arts, resulting in some calluses on his hands, his fingers were long and slender. His hand was so slim that his finger bones could be counted from the back of his hand. When he pushed the dark green Hetian jade ring onto his thumb, it made his whole hand seem even more elegant and good-looking. It looked even better than when Xiao Bojian had worn it.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Hongyu saw that the thumb ring was now on He Changdi\u2019s hand, he shook his head in pity and lamented, \u201cSister-in-Law really has a good eye for things.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had no choice but to admit that this Hetian jade ring was perfect for He Changdi, as if it had been tailor made for him.</p><br/><p>Even He Changdi himself lost track of his surroundings and stared at the ring for two entire seconds.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Hongyu turned and crawled back into his own bed, He Changdi threw another wooden box at him. \u201cYou can use this from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu\u2019s expression turned to joy after he opened the box. Inside it was the white jade thumb ring that He Changdi had been using. He hugged the wooden box and broke out into a wide, foolish smile. \u201cBrother He, at least you have some conscience left in you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hetian jade ring was warm to the touch, a constant reminder of that wicked woman\u2019s existence.</p><br/><p>A little uncomfortable, He Changdi rubbed at the thumb ring.</p><br/><p>Finally, he set his gaze on the other items in the package. Xiao Hongyu was playing with the white jade ring that He Changdi had given him, so he was being very quiet.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much else in the package. Just some sets of clothes that he usually wore. It was just enough to replace the two sets that he had ordered to be thrown away today. They were all inner clothing meant to be under armour.</p><br/><p>One of them was grey and the other was indigo.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang stroked the cloth with his slender fingers. He suddenly paused and looked closely at the indigo set of clothes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

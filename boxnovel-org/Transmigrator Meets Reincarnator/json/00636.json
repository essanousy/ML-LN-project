(4)</strong></p><br/><p>Wenlan looked at the stinky tofu before glancing back at Chu Lian. Finally, she shut her eyes, took up a pair of chopsticks, and shoved a piece of tofu into her mouth.</p><br/><p>Back in the emperor\u2019s luxurious tent, Eunuch Wei had returned from his journey and was now laying out dish after dish in front of the emperor.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s eyes came alight and he pointed at the food in front of him, \u201cWere these all made by Lian\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>When there weren\u2019t any strangers around, the emperor had already started calling Chu Lian by a nickname instead, as if he could become closer to his daughter just by doing so.</p><br/><p>As the emperor\u2019s trusted confidante, Eunuch Wei knew exactly why the emperor was so delighted by a few dishes.</p><br/><p>He smiled and replied, \u201cYes, these were all made personally by Honoured Lady Jinyi. She even instructed this old servant about this dish. This new dish is called stinky tofu, and it has a rather peculiar smell. She said to simply take it away if Your Majesty doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s nose twitched. The smell of the stinky tofu was indeed strange. Although it had already been fried and the smell wasn\u2019t as strong as it might have been, that peculiar odour was still much stronger than the rest of the fragrant dishes on the table.</p><br/><p>However, since it had been made sincerely by Chu Lian\u2019s own hands, the emperor wouldn\u2019t hesitate to eat it, even if it was a poison.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, we will have a taste of every dish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the emperor had already said so, Eunuch Wei naturally wouldn\u2019t try to stop him.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei called over the poison taster, who was also a eunuch. Once the taster had tried the dish, the emperor quickly picked up a piece of stinky tofu and put it into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Just like how it had conquered Old Duke Zheng, the emperor\u2019s taste buds were completely taken over by the stinky tofu.</p><br/><p>Following that, he tried all the other dishes as well. Since Chu Lian had made them for the emperor alone, there wasn\u2019t much in each dish. There was exactly a single bowl\u2019s worth for each one, so even if he finished them all, he wouldn\u2019t be overly full.</p><br/><p>Just as the emperor was enjoying his meal in a great mood, Imperial Concubine Wei and Imperial Princess Leyao arrived.</p><br/><p>Even before she had entered the tent, the emperor and Eunuch Wei could already hear Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s voice from inside.</p><br/><p>The eleven-year-old Leyao was still a child. Her voice held a hint of a child\u2019s clear tones, but it wasn\u2019t very likable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that weird smell in Father\u2019s tent? Why is it so stinky? It smells terrible! What are you darn eunuchs doing? How could you let Father stay in such a smelly tent? Do you still want to keep your heads?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Leyao\u2019s voice had been clear at first, but later on, it turned nasally, indicating that she was pinching her nose closed.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei looked over at the emperor in alarm. What he saw there made him hunker into his shoulders and take a step back in retreat.</p><br/><p>His master\u2019s face was looking extremely thunderous. This was clearly the calm before the storm!</p><br/><p>An instant later, Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s voice travelled over as well, \u201cWhat are you standing there in a daze for? Didn\u2019t you hear what the princess said? Hurry up and bring over some flower dew!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was the sound of footsteps rushing away, clearly off to do Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s bidding.</p><br/><p>It was only now that the tent flap was lifted up from outside as Imperial Concubine Wei and Imperial Princess Leyao entered the imperial tent.</p><br/><p>Once they entered the tent, the smell of the stinky tofu was even stronger.</p><br/><p>Princess Leyao was both sensitive to and disgusted by the smell of the stinky tofu. She was also used to being spoiled and pampered, which meant wearing incense-imbued clothes and carrying flower dew essence around with her. She had never before encountered such a strong odour before. Her line of sight fell upon the emperor\u2019s dining table and she noticed the disgusting, black thing sitting in a white porcelain dish.</p><br/><p>The moment she confirmed that the smell was coming from that dish, Imperial Princess Leyao immediately gagged and ended up puking her guts out\u2026</p><br/><p>Everything happened so suddenly that Imperial Concubine Wei couldn\u2019t even stop her even if she tried.</p><br/><p>She could only watch as her daughter dirtied the spotlessly clean Persian rug on the floor of the imperial tent.</p><br/><p>The emperor had just been eating his middy meal. Now thanks to Imperial Princess Leyao, he no longer had any appetite to eat even the rarest of delicacies.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei was stunned speechless.</p><br/><p>He admitted that the stinky tofu did live up to its name, but the smell wasn\u2019t so bad to that extent, surely? Princess Leyao\u2019s action was quite exaggerated\u2026</p><br/><p>How was His Majesty supposed to continue eating like this?</p><br/><p>He had just been praising the stinky tofu for being delicious\u2026</p><br/><p>The emperor slammed his jade chopsticks onto the table and roared out, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s heart almost leaped out of her throat as she noticed the emperor\u2019s gloomy expression. She hurriedly instructed her attendants to take care of Princess Leyao as she tried to answer the emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease calm down, Your Majesty. Yao\u2019er didn\u2019t do it on purpose! She is sensitive to smells and she\u2019s just a child, so her stomach is weaker. She couldn\u2019t help her reaction when she breathed in the terrible smell in the tent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake her away!\u201d Two eunuchs went up to either side of Princess Leyao, prepared to send her out of the tent.</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei had no choice but to comply. She carefully walked over to the emperor\u2019s side and said, \u201cYour Majesty, it was Yao\u2019er\u2019s fault. Please forgive her as she\u2019s still just a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then cast a glance over the meal laid out on the emperor\u2019s dining table. When she saw the black stinky tofu, she let out a complaint, \u201cFurthermore, this dish is just too smelly! What are the imperial cooks doing? They should be punished!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor had lost all of his earlier good mood and he didn\u2019t want to listen to Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s explanations.</p><br/><p>He waved her away impatiently, \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed. We\u2019re tired and we want to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei hadn\u2019t thought that the emperor would be this angry over the incident. Even if she didn\u2019t want to resign herself, she had no choice but to bob towards the emperor and leave the imperial tent.</p><br/><p>Once Imperial Concubine Wei left, she investigated the incident and found out why the emperor had been so unhappy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

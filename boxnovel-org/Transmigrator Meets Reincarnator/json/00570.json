He wanted to prop He Changdi up.</p><br/><p>He was going to do this by slowly taking away the powers of Count Jing\u2019an, and transferring the influence that the He Family had in the imperial court to He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, if the He Family collected too much power, it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing for the imperial court.</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an was already fifty. That was rather old for an officer. Furthermore, he had spent years away from his family, so it was time for him to return to the capital and spend the remainder of his life in peace.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang stared at her clear almond-shaped eyes, and smiled, \u201cHave you figured out the reason yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blinked at him, \u201cThe Emperor intends to entrust you with greater responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi raised his hand to pinch her soft and rosy cheeks, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian puffed up her cheeks and escaped from his evil clutches.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen my holiday ends, all the matters regarding the Department of Appointments will become my responsibility. When that time comes, I won\u2019t have as much time to spend with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your company,\u201d Chu Lian softly retorted.</p><br/><p>He Changdi tossed the book in his hand aside. He suddenly lowered his body and held her down with one leg. His warm breath washed over her ear as he said, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need my company?\u201d</p><br/><p>His aggressive move caused Chu Lian\u2019s face to become completely flushed. Afraid that he would do something naughty, she used both arms to push against his solid chest, \u201cYou\u2019re too heavy! Don\u2019t squash me, it\u2019s so uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang noticed that his body was reacting to her actions, but knowing that she was likely too tired from what had happened last night, he endured it. He lightly pecked the side of her lips and said, \u201cDon\u2019t seduce me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was feeling very wronged. She hadn\u2019t even done anything at all! How was that considered an attempt at seducing him?</p><br/><p>She glared at him with her wide, watery eyes, but He Changdi covered them with his wide palm. He pressed his lips together, gritted his teeth, and said, \u201cI just told you not to seduce me! Stop, or I\u2019ll do you right here and now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He Changdi reverted back to the relaxed position he was in against the bed. He took out an envelope from his sleeves and handed it to his wife.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sat up, crossed her legs, and leaned against him. With a confused look, she stared at the envelope, \u201cA letter? Who is it from?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was only wearing a thin brown robe. Although the room was heated and it wasn\u2019t cold, He Sanlang was still worried that she would feel chilly, so he pulled up the blanket to cover her legs, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a letter, open it up and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian received the envelope with suspicion and opened it. There were two booklets inside. When she took them out, she could feel that they were made of high-quality paper. Once she flipped them open, she realised that they were deeds.</p><br/><p>The deeds were for a storefront situated in an excellent location on Zhuque Avenue. The two deeds were for the shophouse in the front and the courtyard right behind it.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes went wide with astonishment and she exclaimed, \u201cWhere did you get such a good storefront?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the good locations on Zhuque Street were already owned by someone high-ranking in the capital. It was no simple task to obtain such a good storefront, as it was something that money couldn\u2019t buy.</p><br/><p>Even if these were obtainable through wealth alone, the value of these two deeds added together would at least be five thousand taels\u2026</p><br/><p>That was going by a conservative estimate.</p><br/><p>Even House Jing\u2019an hadn\u2019t owned any storefronts on Zhuque Street at its prime. They had held one or two shops on a side street nearby at the most.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If the Third Young Madam from House Jing\u2019an really went to the banquet hall and asked for forgiveness from Old Marquis Dingyuan in front of all the distinguished male guests, House Jing\u2019an would never be able to hold their heads high in the capital again.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for the crowd to pity her, Chu Lian said with a clear voice, \u201cHowever, I\u2019m willing to compensate Madam Huang with more longevity peach buns.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s sparkling eyes, straight back, and complete lack of any cowardice drew everyone\u2019s gazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? How are you going to make up for them? These longevity peach buns were made by De\u2019an Restaurant\u2019s Mr Wang. Can you make the exact same ones?\u201d The one speaking was Feudal Princess Anmin. She raised her chin slightly, showing off her clear disdain for a lowly person like Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled; coming from someone already pretty and innocent \u2014 and on her way to becoming a great beauty \u2014 her smile was like a refreshing spring breeze.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dare to claim that I can make the exact same ones, but I can definitely make something even better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! De\u2019an Restaurant\u2019s Mr Wang makes the best longevity peach buns in the entire capital. How could you possibly make something better?!\u201d Zou Yuanqin hadn\u2019t expected Chu Lian to say something like that. She refuted her on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth Miss Zou, how could you know that without seeing it for yourself? I\u2019m in the wrong for knocking over Madam Huang\u2019s longevity peach buns today, but since Madam Huang is a magnanimous person, please grant me a chance to make up for it.\u201d Chu Lian\u2019s first sentence was meant for Zou Yuanqin, but her next sentence was aimed towards Madam Huang.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had already gotten some goodwill from the crowd thanks to her performance. Now that she was making such a sincere request to Madam Huang, it showed that she knew when to push and when to retreat. This action earned even more positive assessments from the crowd. Anyway, everything had happened so quickly; who knew if it was even Chu Lian who bumped into that maidservant just now?</p><br/><p>At this point, many of the madams were leaning towards Chu Lian\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Zou Yuanqin\u2019s neck was starting to turn red from all her anger. She refused to let Chu Lian off and said, \u201cSo what if you can make longevity peach buns? Don\u2019t tell me that they\u2019ll be able to match up to Mr Wang\u2019s? Mr Wang only makes one order of longevity peach buns per person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s expression turned solemn. \u201cFifth Miss Zou. If we\u2019re talking about food, we should judge by sincerity and taste. As long as the longevity peach buns I make are more delicious than Mr Wang\u2019s, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s better than any of those false tricks?\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, that was just a silly trick!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the crowd was awakened by Chu Lian\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>No matter how expensive they were, it was just a plate of longevity peach buns and De\u2019an Restaurant was out to make money. If the Emperor wanted to eat two plates of longevity peach buns, that Mr Wang couldn\u2019t possibly defy an imperial edict for the sake of this principle.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, how could a noble young madam from House Jing\u2019an be compared to a lowly cook from De\u2019an Restaurant?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s words were like a slap to the face.</p><br/><p>Fifth Miss Zou was so angry that her face and neck were flushed red, but she couldn\u2019t say a word in retort.</p><br/><p>Madam Huang glared at her daughter. With the situation as it was now, she could only agree to Chu Lian\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>If she didn\u2019t give her this chance, then it would be Madam Huang and her daughter who were the discourteous ones.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam. I\u2019ll give you this chance today. However, if you don\u2019t manage to make longevity peach buns that taste better than Mr Wang\u2019s, even if Matriarch He is here, I won\u2019t show you any mercy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Huang was the madam in charge of the Dingyuan estate now, and she was used to dealing with the high echelons of society. Thus, she had a powerful aura about her. Any normal young lady would probably be shocked stiff by her threatening words.</p><br/><p>However, Chu Lian was the one facing her!</p><br/><p>The business dealings in the modern world were much more sly and craftier than this, and she had met all sorts of bosses before. How could she be afraid of someone like Madam Huang?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Madam.\u201d Chu Lian respectfully bobbed towards Madam Huang.</p><br/><p>Her actions were completely in line with etiquette, and there was nothing to pick on.</p><br/><p>Although Madam Huang was inwardly raging, on the outside, she maintained her elegant demeanour.</p><br/><p>Her sharp eyes watched Chu Lian as she secretly harrumphed.</p><br/><p>Inside the privacy of her mind, she thought, don\u2019t think longevity peach buns are that easy to make! There must be something behind Mr Wang\u2019s peach buns since his business has been doing so well! At least, up until now, all the nobles who ate Mr Wang\u2019s longevity peach buns have had nothing but praise for them.</p><br/><p>Child, be careful. It won\u2019t be easy to clean up your mess if you\u2019ve boasted beyond your abilities!</p><br/><p>You might think it\u2019s easy just by watching others, but when you\u2019re really put on the spot, you\u2019ll find that it isn\u2019t as easy as you thought!</p><br/><p>House Jing\u2019an had managed to become popular amongst the nobles in the capital just by having a pastry chef who could make tasty snacks. That was how valuable secret recipes were. If House Ying had some secret recipe for longevity peach buns that was better than Mr Wang\u2019s, they would have used it to gain popularity a lot earlier!</p><br/><p>After thinking it through, Madam Huang was even more certain that Chu Lian was being too overconfident. She didn\u2019t believe that Chu Lian could make anything close to Mr Wang\u2019s longevity peach buns, never mind something better than them.</p><br/><p>When Madam Rong, who was still standing in the crowd, heard that Chu Lian was going to suddenly make longevity peach buns of her own, she almost fainted out of shock. She had eaten Mr Wang\u2019s longevity peach buns only once before. They were much tastier than House Jing\u2019an\u2019s pastries. Then there was Chu Lian, who hadn\u2019t even entered the Ying Estate\u2019s kitchen before her marriage. How could she possibly know how to make longevity peach buns?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

(2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Now that she had someone to back her up, Miss Yuan looked at Chu Lian in delight, flaunting her power.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was too lazy to argue with this braindead pair of father and daughter. She rolled her eyes with an exaggerated motion, without any care for her image. She then snorted and said, \u201cDaddy, why did you come to interrogate me without first making sure of the truth? Those not in the know might even think that I\u2019m not really your daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Qizheng glared at her in disbelief that she would say such words. His rage shot through the roof and he was about to vent his temper and give her a sound scolding. However, Chu Lian didn\u2019t give him the chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, I hope Daddy can investigate the truth properly before coming to interrogate your daughter. Don\u2019t just place all the blame on me without any proof. My husband isn\u2019t around and I\u2019m alone, so I can\u2019t withstand your accusations. It was me who bought that golden hairpin you mentioned. One hundred and fifty taels: no more, no less. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask the manager over at Jinshi Pavilion. If Eighth Sister likes it, Daddy can buy one for Eighth Sister there. I\u2019m sure that Daddy won\u2019t be bothered about spending such a trivial sum of money since you\u2019re such a great and mighty man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t continue any further. She boarded her carriage by herself. With a crack of the driver\u2019s whip, Chu Lian\u2019s carriage departed with the escort of her family servants, disappearing from Chu Qizheng\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>Chu Qizheng only knew Chu Lian as the daughter who sometimes craved for his approval. He hadn\u2019t expected her to completely abandon all consideration for his pride- she had disgraced him without a second thought! His face was as black as a pot. However, he couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with what Chu Lian had said, either.</p><br/><p>Finally, he could only hold back his anger and question Miss Yuan. \u201cIs what your Sixth Sister said true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan knew that her plot had failed again, so she harrumphed and said, \u201cSixth Sister bought that golden hairpin, but I was clearly the one who chose it first!\u201d As she spoke, she started to cry. She looked up at Chu Qizheng with a pitiful expression. \u201cDaddy, I really like that golden hairpin. Maybe\u2026 Daddy can buy a hairpin for little Yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Buying a hairpin?</p><br/><p>Chu Qizheng\u2019s face froze. Second Madam was strictly in charge of the finances at home, and he didn\u2019t have much squared away in his private funds. He usually went out to play, drink, and have fun. How could he possibly have a hundred taels to buy a hairpin?! What a dangerous thought that Miss Yuan had!</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! Stop thinking about buying this and that! All you know how to do is spend money on accessories! Girls your age should be doing more productive things, like focusing on your studies.\u201d Chu Qizheng tossed his sleeves and left. Due to Chu Lian\u2019s words, his chest was full of rage.</p><br/><p>When Miss Yuan saw that her plan hadn\u2019t come to fruition, she wiped her tears with a handkerchief and looked down with reddened eyes. Her heart was full of hate for Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Miss Fu and Miss Su were watching from afar. Miss Fu\u2019s lips curled up and she mocked, \u201cEver since Sixth Sister got married, she\u2019s been getting more and more difficult to deal with. \u201c</p><br/><p>However, Miss Su didn\u2019t share her thoughts. If only she could be as straightforward and decisive as Sixth Sister was!</p><br/><p>On the way back to the Jing\u2019an Estate, Chu Lian leaned against the wall and rested her eyes for a while. Wenqing and Wenlan sat to one side and carefully watched her expression. Finally, Wenqing couldn\u2019t hold back any longer and began to try to console her. \u201cThird Young Madam, please don\u2019t think too much about what just happened. You\u2019re now a member of House Jing\u2019an. You have Third Young Master, Madam, and the matriarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Chu Lian opened her eyes to look at Wenqing. She suddenly smiled and reached out to pinch Wenqing\u2019s nose. \u201cYou silly girl, what are you thinking about? I\u2019m not angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law both treated her very well. Chu Lian was already satisfied. As for that crazy, absentee husband of hers, forget it. She had never thought of expecting anything from him.</p><br/><p>When Wenqing saw that Chu Lian\u2019s smile seemed to be genuine and she really wasn\u2019t bothered by what happened just now, she heaved a sigh of relief together with Wenlan. Following that, she purposely tried to cheer her master up with a couple jokes.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian rolled her eyes. \u201cAlright, enough. Your jokes aren\u2019t funny at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing covered her smile with a hand. \u201cIf Third Young Madam has any funnier jokes, then why don\u2019t you share them with us servants?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian coughed once for effect. \u201cThen listen carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan nodded seriously. Chu Lian coughed again into her fist before sending a sneaky glance at Wenqing and Wenlan with wide, watery eyes. \u201cIf a fatty jumps from a nine-storey pagoda, what will he turn into?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan thought long and hard, and gave all sorts of guesses. They even tried guessing \u2018a god\u2019, but Chu Lian still shook her head.</p><br/><p>Wenqing was burning with curiosity since she couldn\u2019t guess the answer. With a coquettish lilt, she pleaded, \u201cThird Young Madam, please tell us the answer~! What will he turn into?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dead serious, Chu Lian stated the answer without a single break in her expression. \u201cWhat else could it be? He\u2019d turn into a dead fatty, of course! What kind of human can survive a fall from a nine-storey tall pagoda?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the final answer, Wenqing and Wenlan looked like they just ate a mouthful of flies. Their mouths opened and closed, but in the end, they couldn\u2019t manage to say anything. From then on, the two maidservants never asked Third Young Madam for a joke ever again. Her jokes were way too lame! They weren\u2019t funny at all. Sob sob sob.</p><br/><p>When she saw Wenqing and Wenlan\u2019s expressions, Chu Lian couldn\u2019t restrain herself any longer and fell back laughing inside the carriage.</p><br/><p>Although her maiden family didn\u2019t love her and her husband wasn\u2019t interested in her, at least her handmaids were all really cute. With these sisters by her side, she didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit lonely at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

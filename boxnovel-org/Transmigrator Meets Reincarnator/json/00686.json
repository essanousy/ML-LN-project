However, now he refused to let her sleep alone in bed.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the protests of the two senior servants, He Changdi had removed the chaise by the bed and was now hugging her to sleep every night. He would even help her turn around at times. Sometimes, when it came to midnight, Chu Lian would suffer cramping in her legs. Since she slept in his arms, the moment she moved, he would wake immediately and help her with the cramps.</p><br/><p>As time passed and he became used to his \u2018work\u2019, Chu Lian was starting to feel that her husband had become even better than Xiyan at taking care of her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was still in the midst of a daze. She turned to look up at He Changdi with blank eyes.</p><br/><p>When He Changdi noticed that there wasn\u2019t any pain in her expression, he first heaved a sigh of relief before placing a kiss on her cheek. He lowered his voice and whispered gently into her ear, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Something moved within her bloated belly again. This time, Chu Lian was completely sure of what was going on. She came back to her senses and burst into a wide smile. She replied He Changdi with an equally soft voice, \u201cHubby, he\u2019s moving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>The novice dad was completely confused.</p><br/><p>The smile on Chu Lian\u2019s face widened into a grin until her eyes were sparkling.</p><br/><p>She pulled He Changdi\u2019s hand over and set it down on her belly.</p><br/><p>The little bun then helpfully gave another tiny kick.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was trained in martial arts, so his five senses were stronger than most. He could clearly feel a bump suddenly appearing on the smooth skin he was touching, before subsiding back down.</p><br/><p>He reacted just like Chu Lian had and froze up entirely.</p><br/><p>Cracks started appearing in his frozen expression as he processed what was going on. The weird look on his face made Chu Lian burst out into peals of bell-like laughter.</p><br/><p>She covered He Changdi\u2019s hand with her own and wrapped her other arm around his neck. She looked up at him, full of smiles, as she continued watching his expression change.</p><br/><p>This was the first time she had felt the baby move in her whole pregnancy. Being able to share in this moment with her loved one was a different sort of bliss.</p><br/><p>He Changdi gulped hard. His normally clear eyes were now clouded over in bewilderment. He asked stupidly, \u201cThis is our child moving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded with a smile, \u201cThe little fellow is saying his to his dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was talking, He Changdi could feel another bump under his hands.</p><br/><p>This time, the baby kicked much harder than before. Perhaps he had sensed his dear dad on the other side, so he wasn\u2019t holding back in the last. The force of this kick made Chu Lian gasp a little.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s expression immediately turned into a frown upon seeing this. His face turned somewhat overcast as he asked, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi rubbed a circle around his wife\u2019s belly, \u201cWhy is this rascal so disobedient?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile dropped from Chu Lian\u2019s face and she rolled her eyes at her husband, \u201cHe\u2019s only a few months old, it\u2019s just a subconscious reaction from our little fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi let out a cold chuckle, which sent a chill down Chu Lian\u2019s spine.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to take care of you even while in your belly. Well, let\u2019s see how I\u2019ll take care of him when he\u2019s out!\u201d</p><br/><p>A twitch developed in the corner of Chu Lian\u2019s mouth, \u201cAre there any dads like you? He hasn\u2019t even been born yet and you\u2019re already thinking of how to discipline him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be glad he\u2019s not out yet, or it won\u2019t just be a verbal threat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had no words to reply to that\u2026</p><br/><p>However, perhaps the little fellow had realised that he was being threatened by his dear old dad. Later on, whenever He Changdi was by Chu Lian\u2019s side, he refused to move at all.</p><br/><p>Standing far off behind the corner of a wall, Muxiang stared at the happy couple hugging in the pavilion with dead eyes. Her lip was already red from how hard she was biting it.</p><br/><p>There was a poisonous look in her eyes. She wanted Chu Lian to just fall right into the lotus pond.</p><br/><p>Her fists were already clenched so tight that her nails were digging into the flesh of her palm, while her expression was contorted into an ugly mask.</p><br/><p>She had been enduring for all this time, but it was finally time to take action. In this lifetime, anyone who stole away her \u2018husband\u2019 would die a gruesome death! Even if it was someone in her previous body!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

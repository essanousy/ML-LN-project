Please don\u2019t try to arrange a meeting with me ever again. I\u2019m not interested in you at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Chu Lian couldn\u2019t say something like that. Instead, she leaned close and whispered into Xiyan\u2019s ear. \u201cHelp me block him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan was a smart one. She immediately shielded Chu Lian behind her and drummed up the courage to speak to Xiao Bojian. \u201cMister Xiao, please leave. Our madam doesn\u2019t want to see you. If you\u2019re still going to continue forcing the issue, this servant\u2026 this servant will call the guards!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian didn\u2019t bother with Xiyan. He only stared dead-on at Chu Lian, who was still hiding behind Xiyan. He pushed closer step by step until the girls were forced into a corner of the pavilion. Behind them was a stand of flowering trees; it looked like they couldn\u2019t escape anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, please talk to me. Are you really not even going to look at me anymore? Have you forgotten about the promise we had?\u201d Xiao Bojian\u2019s eyes reddened, and he looked like he was struggling with some inner pain.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had been observing Xiao Bojian in secret from behind Xiyan. When she realised his emotions seemed to be getting out of hand, her brows furrowed with tension.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian was only one of Old Duke Ying\u2019s students right now. He was born in poverty, and was twenty years old now. Last autumn, he had gotten first place in the provincial imperial examinations and had become the top scholar of Jiaqing Hall. Right now, he was living in the Ying Estate to await the last two stages of examinations to become a court official: the metropolitan examination and the final imperial exam.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian knew that once the final imperial examination was over this year, Xiao Bojian would get the achievement of ranking first in three consecutive imperial examinations, displaying his extraordinary talent in the capital. It was around that time that the original female lead had really started to \u2018hook up\u2019 with Xiao Bojian.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Bojian was handsome and full of potential, Chu Lian didn\u2019t really like him. If she had to choose, she would pick He Changdi. At least He Changdi had a kind heart somewhere deep inside of him; he knew where to draw the line with his actions and wouldn\u2019t go too far.</p><br/><p>Those who didn\u2019t have any limits were the scariest. Xiao Bojian was undoubtedly that kind of person.</p><br/><p>Constantly trying to avoid him wasn\u2019t a solution. It was clear that Xiao Bojian had currently lost control of his emotions. Chu Lian gulped and managed to gather enough courage to raise her head, meeting Xiao Bojian\u2019s reddened, upturned eyes bravely.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bojian, no matter what we were in the past, I\u2019m already a married woman. The past is in the past. You should go your own way, and I\u2019ll go mine.\u201d Chu Lian spoke resolutely. She was so nervous that the palms of her tightly clenched fists were soaked in sweat.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian could never have imagined that his long period of waiting would yield such a heartless response from Chu Lian. His face contorted with the force of his emotions and he abruptly took a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, you\u2019re joking with me, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s not what we agreed on before you left to get married. You said that even if you were married to He Changdi, that you would find a way to leave him! You even said that I was the only one you had in your heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xiao Bojian continued speaking, the trembling of his body became even more intense.</p><br/><p>The lady before him was so pretty and delicate, like a blooming peony flower. Her elegant beauty and that subtle fragrance gave him the urge to pull her into his embrace and protect her from the world; he couldn\u2019t bear to see her suffer the slightest bit of pain.</p><br/><p>He had accompanied this flower on her journey of growth; he had nurtured her, watched her grow and slowly bloom.</p><br/><p>However, this flower had just used her thorns against him, leaving bleeding wounds all over his body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

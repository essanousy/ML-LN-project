It was no wonder that her mother missed the capital so dearly.</p><br/><p>Once she thought of it this way, Pan Nianzhen began to envy the noble ladies who grew up here.</p><br/><p>She stealthily glanced at Matriarch He who sat at the head of the table with a grudging look. Even though the capital was so rich and lavish, even though House Jing\u2019an was obviously thriving, it wasn\u2019t until autumn this year that her grandmother had allowed the two of them to return.</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since Matriarch He had been this happy. She kept adding food into their bowls. Satisfaction warmed her heart as she watched them enjoy their meal.</p><br/><p>No matter what He Ying had done in her youth, she was still Matriarch He\u2019s very own flesh and blood. Matriarch He only had this one daughter as well. Now that decades had already passed, her daughter had likely undergone enough suffering and hardship in the outside world to learn her lesson. It was fine if her daughter now returned to stay and pass her days happily with her again.</p><br/><p>As for this granddaughter of hers, Matriarch He planned to treat her well.</p><br/><p>The six dishes should have been more than enough for the three of them, especially since the matriarch had a small appetite. There should even be leftovers. However, all of the plates were completely wiped clean. When He Ying and her daughter were done, there was no longer any food left in sight. They had even used some plain buns to soak up all the remaining gravy in the sliced pork dish.</p><br/><p>It was only after setting down their bowls and chopsticks that the two finally noticed the discomfort from their bloated stomachs. When they looked again at the messy table, as thick-skinned as she was, even He Ying\u2019s face flushed red.</p><br/><p>The servants waiting on them had awkward expressions as they looked at them. Even Muxiang was looking at them with some contempt.</p><br/><p>The matriarch, on the other hand, had a gentle look in her eyes. She asked with sympathy, \u201cHave you had your fill? If you want more, I\u2019ll have the kitchen cook a few more dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying quickly shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mother, we\u2019re already full.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they had eaten too much at lunch, He Ying and her daughter rested in a side room in Qingxi Hall for over two hours. When they woke up, Senior Servant Liu led Pan Nianzhen to Songtao Court to borrow some clothes.</p><br/><p>Once they arrived at the entrance of Songtao Court, Senior Servant Liu happily introduced the place to her, \u201cMiss Pan, this is the residence of Third Young Master and Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen looked into the courtyard. Although it was winter, it didn\u2019t seem chilly here at all. There was even some greenery left in the garden amidst the decorative mountains, and there were some wintersweet flowers blooming to the side.</p><br/><p>She looked at the place with admiration and envy. Back in Siyang, only the elders of the family would get to live in a courtyard as lovely as this. The junior members of the family wouldn\u2019t get a turn at all. So her older cousins had been living in such a wonderful environment their whole lives.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu wasn\u2019t bothered by her silence. She just continued introducing the interesting things in the courtyard, not knowing if Pan Nianzhen was actually listening.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

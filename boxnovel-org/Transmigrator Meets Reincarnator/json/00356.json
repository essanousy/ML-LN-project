It was hard for him to admit he hadn\u2019t been able to find out what Chu Lian was up to. That small courtyard of hers was now bustling with activity and there were people hauling wooden planks in and out all the time.</p><br/><p>Although the old soldier was unable to come up with any words to report, Mo Chenggui was able to understand the meaning behind his silence. He had already been simmering with anger towards Chu Lian before this. This strange new activity of hers was the last bit of fuel that sent his temper rocketing sky-high!</p><br/><p>He slammed his palm on the table, making the porcelain teacups on it clatter as they trembled from the force. \u201cIs Third Young Madam completely ignoring our presence?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Back then, he hadn\u2019t been very approving of the matriarch sending Third Young Madam here to the north. She was just a little girl, barely come of age, who was probably used to being spoiled all day and night. What would she be able to achieve out here?</p><br/><p>Just look at what she had done on the way here.</p><br/><p>She had been sent here to help Third Young Master, but her actions said otherwise. She had clearly come out to sightsee on her personal leisure trip, but at public expense!</p><br/><p>The moment she had arrived at the northern border, she had already caused trouble for Third Young Master and he had been punished by martial law.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui had been held back by He Changdi\u2019s orders previously. Even though he was extremely unhappy with Chu Lian, he had suppressed his anger towards her and hadn\u2019t done anything. They had each minded their own business.</p><br/><p>However, this sudden snow storm was like the last piece of straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. All of the negative emotions within Mo Chenggui had accumulated to a point where he could no longer suppress them. Right now, he felt like a volcano about to explode.</p><br/><p>These two days, the first thing that Chu Lian did every morning after waking up was to visit the old carpenter in the storehouse and check on the progress of her project.</p><br/><p>Although the old carpenter was a little too shrewd, he was an utmost professional and skilled at his craft. After making a promise to Chu Lian, he had devoted his heart to his work. After working with his sons and grandsons for two days and two nights, Chu Lian\u2019s project was almost complete.</p><br/><p>The old carpenter had started working before the sun had even risen. When he heard the door opening, he knew that it was Chu Lian who had come to visit. Every day at this hour, the esteemed madam would come over personally to take a look at his progress.</p><br/><p>He set down the woodworking plane in his hands and hurried over to welcome her, \u201cThis old man gives greetings to Esteemed Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian waved her hand and asked, \u201cOld Master, will you be able to finish your work today?\u201d</p><br/><p>When it came to the topic of woodworking, the old carpenter\u2019s originally bent back immediately straightened up with pride.</p><br/><p>He focused his gaze at the object placed in the center of the storehouse as if he were looking at a child he had raised, \u201cEsteemed Madam, please don\u2019t worry. This old man is as good as his word. This old man will be able to finish this before night falls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian moved a little closer to the object. The old carpenter was right, it looked exactly like the object she had drawn out in her blueprints.</p><br/><p>She glanced at the rest of the storehouse and noticed that the old carpenter\u2019s sons and grandsons were standing respectfully to one side. She found it strange and spoke up, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to care about my presence here, please be at ease and continue your work!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old carpenter let out an unabashed bark of laughter that was as honest as the man it had come from, \u201cEsteemed Madam, these kids aren\u2019t purposely standing around because of you. We\u2019ve used up all the wood we had, so Master Qin went out early in the morning to buy more. This old man\u2019s just waiting for the materials. Once Master Qin returns, we\u2019ll be able to finish our work in just one hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian knew what the rough design should be, she wasn\u2019t very sure about the kind of materials she should use for it since it was her first time making something like this. After discussing with the old carpenter, she had decided on using fir wood, which was harder and more robust.</p><br/><p>After testing their first prototype, they wouldn\u2019t have to be so rigid with the choice of materials later on.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded and left the storehouse. Once she reached the entrance, she ordered Wenlan to send the old carpenter and his helpers something nice to eat.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

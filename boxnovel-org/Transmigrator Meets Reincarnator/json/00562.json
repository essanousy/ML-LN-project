She sighed, \u201cIt was all my fault for agreeing with your father\u2019s decision to marry you off to Siyang that year.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying hastily shook her head, \u201cMother, what are you saying? It\u2019s already been so many years. I\u2019ve already moved on from what happened. At that time, I was the one in the wrong, causing Mother to lose face.\u201d</p><br/><p>After spending time together these past few days, He Ying had already noticed that her mother wasn\u2019t as sharp as before. She has become more muddle-headed and soft-hearted as she got older. Every time she acknowledged her mistakes and acted pitiful, her mother would be especially affectionate to her.</p><br/><p>She had tried this trick many times and it had worked every time so far.</p><br/><p>As expected, Matriarch He\u2019s face was filled with remorse. Her heart ached as she patted her daughter\u2019s hand, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Ying. Mother will find a good husband for Nianzhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was her daughter\u2019s only child, so she couldn\u2019t bear letting her suffer.</p><br/><p>A corner of He Ying\u2019s lips lifted up in celebration of her success, hidden by the shadows falling over her face.</p><br/><p>Her eyes darted about. She felt that this was a good chance to mention her suggestion to her mother.</p><br/><p>She organised her thoughts and moved closer to Matriarch He. She hugged Matriarch He\u2019s arm and swayed it lightly, \u201cMother, Miss Pan is my only daughter. I can\u2019t bear to let her marry somewhere far away. I\u2019m also worried that her husband\u2019s family will mistreat her. After all, I experienced that misery myself in the past. If possible, I would rather keep Miss Pan right here with me forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch\u2019s gaze was unfocused. A bitter and remorseful expression emerged on her face. It was hard to tell if she was thinking of the year that her daughter had been sent off far away.</p><br/><p>He Ying continued, \u201cMother, Erlang is already twenty-five this year. The sons of other families around his age already have several children by now. Since he\u2019s still single, there are unpleasant rumours spreading outside. Miss Pan is Erlang\u2019s younger cousin and she\u2019s also at a suitable age. Since Erlang doesn\u2019t want to marry a woman that he doesn\u2019t know, why don\u2019t we pair them up? Elder Sister-in-law has a good personality, so I\u2019ll be at ease with her taking care of Miss Zhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was baffled by her daughter\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Although she wanted to help her granddaughter find a good husband, she had never considered letting her granddaughter marry into her own household.</p><br/><p>Erlang was an old bachelor and she had been continuously searching for a suitable bride for him. However, Erlang was stubborn and he had never agreed to any of her suggestions before.</p><br/><p>Although He Erlang seemed careless, he actually had his way of doing things. Even his mother couldn\u2019t convince him otherwise, let alone his grandmother!</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t so, she wouldn\u2019t be waiting for a grandson still.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He didn\u2019t agree blindly with her daughter\u2019s suggestion this time. Her expression became stern for a moment, but she instantly felt that she was being too harsh on her daughter. Thus, she relaxed her expression and tried persuading her daughter, \u201cMiss Ying, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help Miss Zhen, but it\u2019s really not appropriate to have Erlang marry Miss Zhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying didn\u2019t think that her normally agreeable mother would reject her immediately. Her eyes reddened in grievance. She pulled her arm back and complained, \u201cMother, you don\u2019t say it out loud, but you actually hold contempt for us, right? Scorning us for potentially staining my nephew\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch was heartbroken when she saw her daughter weeping, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing. Miss Ying, why would I scorn you? I gave birth to you! You\u2019re my very own daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you Mother agree to Miss Pan and Erlang\u2019s marriage? Erlang isn\u2019t getting any younger. Don\u2019t you know the rumours that other people are spreading about Erlang? Miss Pan is as beautiful as a flower and of a suitable age. Apart from her family background, which part of her isn\u2019t worthy to match Erlang?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His second brother was only two years older than him, and they had been at the age where they craved attention. However, Consort Liang had treated him even better than she treated Second Brother. She had even taught Second Brother to yield to him since he was younger.</p><br/><p>This had made Second Brother unhappy with him on many occasions, as he believed that he had taken away his mother\u2019s love.</p><br/><p>Every time Father bestowed treasures to them, Consort Liang would let him choose first, before letting Second Brother choose from the remainders.</p><br/><p>He remembered the favour she had shown towards him, so after growing up and becoming an adult, he had always helped Second Brother.</p><br/><p>He had even helped Second Brother to get the role of Crown Prince.</p><br/><p>Second Prince wasn\u2019t particularly talented, so without his help, there was no way the position of Crown Prince would have fallen to him after their eldest brother had passed away from illness.</p><br/><p>He had never thought of vying for that position of supremacy. He only wished for Second Brother to ascend the throne, so he could then live in peace.</p><br/><p>But what he had learned had caused his heart to freeze over.</p><br/><p>Once Second Brother ascended the throne and Consort Liang became the Empress Dowager, he was likely going to be the first one they were going to kill off!</p><br/><p>Liu Buyong noticed that Prince Jin had been standing still for quite some time, so he mustered his courage to remind him, \u201cFourth Prince, it\u2019s cold outside, please go indoors quickly. Crown Prince is still waiting for you under the eaves!\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin returned to his senses after Liu Buyong\u2019s reminder. There was no change in his expression as he stepped into Chengxiang Hall.</p><br/><p>After his attendants notified Crown Prince of Prince Jin\u2019s presence, Crown Prince turned to look at Prince Jin who was walking over from a distance.</p><br/><p>A grudgeful look showed in Crown Prince\u2019s eyes for a moment and was quickly hidden away.</p><br/><p>When Prince Jin finally came up to Crown Prince and was about to bow and greet him, Crown Prince grabbed Prince Jin\u2019s arm to help him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so formal with me, Fourth Brother. Let\u2019s go in, Mother is waiting! I heard from Liu Buyong that tonight\u2019s dinner was personally cooked by Mother. I can\u2019t wait to taste Mother\u2019s cooking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin was dragged into the main hall by his brother.</p><br/><p>There were more than ten lanterns lit up on each side of the main hall, making it as bright as day within Chengxiang Hall.</p><br/><p>On a slightly raised platform at the back of the hall, there was a slim middle-aged lady seated on a chaise. She had a kindly look on her face, while dressed in a simple ochre-coloured imperial robe with a five-tailed phoenix hairpin inlaid with jade on her head. The tassels on the hairpin hung all the way down to her temple, and it made her look more lively when they swayed.</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s complexion was slightly pale. Her curved brows, wide eyes, tall nose, and thin red lips came together to present the very picture of a gentle noblewoman.</p><br/><p>Although she didn\u2019t seem to be in the best of health, her marvellous beauty still shone through.</p><br/><p>This dignified and elegant lady was Consort Liang.</p><br/><p>Consort Liang sat cross-legged on the chaise. When her gaze swept past the entrance, she noticed Crown Prince and Prince Jin entering shoulder-to-shoulder. Her eyes brightened up and she happily stood to receive them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Sheng, Ah Yi, you\u2019ve finally come! Ah Yi, let me take a good look at you, I haven\u2019t seen you for ages!\u201d</p><br/><p>Consort Liang\u2019s eyes were filled with tender affection, she looked over Prince Jin carefully to assess him with tears welling up in her eyes.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince stood to one side, left out of the heartwarming scene. If a stranger were watching, they would probably think that Fourth Prince was Consort Liang\u2019s own son instead! From an angle that others couldn\u2019t see, Crown Prince stared at Prince Jin with jealousy in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve become taller, and skinnier too. Ah Yi, you must have gone through much hardship outside. It\u2019s all my fault, I should have stopped your Father from giving you such a difficult task.\u201d As she spoke, tears started to fall from her eyes from her heartache.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

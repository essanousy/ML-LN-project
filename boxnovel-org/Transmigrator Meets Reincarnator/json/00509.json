She showed her pale and smooth hand to He Changdi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d He Changdi pretended not to understand his wife\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the letter? I want to read it. I want to see what nonsense that Xiao Bojian was trying to pull!\u201d Chu Lian was about to explode in anger.</p><br/><p>What kind of situation was this? Why did it feel like she had been wronged through no fault of her own?</p><br/><p>Her hand was beginning to feel sore from being outstretched, but He Changdi didn\u2019t move an inch.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see the letter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian reminded him again.</p><br/><p>He Changdi awkwardly coughed a few times.</p><br/><p>He tried to avoid meeting his wife\u2019s questioning gaze.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gaped in shock. She asked with a hint of disbelief, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you destroyed the letter?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang awkwardly turned his head away. He pursed his lips without speaking.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed his evasive gaze and knew that she had hit the nail on the head.</p><br/><p>Anger flared up within her, giving her the urge to punch him a few times.</p><br/><p>She puffed up her cheeks and glared at He Changdi with her big eyes for a long moment. Finally, Chu Lian angrily turned around so her back faced He Changdi.</p><br/><p>It was only at this moment that He Changdi finally realised that he had been too impulsive earlier.</p><br/><p>However, there was absolutely no way he could have controlled the rage and jealousy in his heart while holding a letter from his love rival in his hand.</p><br/><p>He Changdi knew he had made a mistake. He reached out, wanting to turn Chu Lian around to face him.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wasn\u2019t willing to let him have his way and stubbornly ignored him.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang knew his wife was really angry with him, so he didn\u2019t dare to use force. He could only pat on her back lightly, like he was trying to soothe a grumpy little kitten.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to continue like this for long, so she spoke up, \u201cGo wash up first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi stared at the side profile of his wife\u2019s face for a while before he got up and went to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mood was slightly better when she didn\u2019t hear him call for the maidservants outside.</p><br/><p>She laid on her side, wrapped inside the soft blankets, and thought about the things that He Changdi had just told her. She was really curious about what Xiao Bojian had written in the letter that Fuyan had been keeping. Also, how had Fuyan gotten hold of that letter? It was too bad that He Changdi had already burned that letter. She couldn\u2019t even read it if she wanted to.</p><br/><p>Perhaps due to having waited for He Changdi too late into the night, or perhaps from all the tiring activities of the day, she ended up falling asleep as she was thinking\u2026</p><br/><p>When He Sanlang came out of the bathroom, the first thing he noticed was his wife\u2019s sweet sleeping visage.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t get into bed immediately. He sat by the bedside for a long time, dressed only in a thin sleeping gown. His shadowed eyes stayed on Chu Lian\u2019s gentle face. It was as if he wanted to engrave her face into his heart, so that he would never forget it.</p><br/><p>The night had already passed when he finally laid down and embraced the petite woman beside him. Slivers of light were creeping up over the horizon to the east.</p><br/><p>The next morning, when the young couple ate breakfast together, the atmosphere between them had become a lot more relaxed.</p><br/><p>It was such a surprise that Senior Servant Gui even purposely asked Wenlan about it in private.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian and He Changdi finished their breakfast and the maidservants had cleared the table, He Changdi asked Chu Lian a question as she was sipping some honey water.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you planning to deal with Fuyan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that they had lured all the perpetrators out from hiding, the couple didn\u2019t need to continue acting at odds anymore, so their interactions were naturally more intimate than yesterday.</p><br/><p>However, the tension from their quarrel in the carriage still hadn\u2019t been dispelled completely. Thus, there was still a tiny bit of distance between them.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian understood her own shortcomings. She wasn\u2019t someone born and raised during the Great Wu Dynasty after all, so she was too soft-hearted at times.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou decide what to do with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi looked up to meet her eyes, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll be too severe with her? Despite everything, she has been serving you since your maiden days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head, \u201cSince I\u2019ve already handed her over to you, do with her as you see fit. If you leave it to me, it might cause us some trouble in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang dropped the topic, \u201cAlright. Since you\u2019ve handed her over to me, don\u2019t ask about it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian and He Changdi were still talking when a maidservant came in to report that Matriarch He had requested the couple to go over.</p><br/><p>The couple exchanged looks. They returned to their room to change before going to Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>It was still rather early. It wasn\u2019t even time yet for the usual morning greetings.</p><br/><p>Most of the family were already present when the young couple arrived at Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>Even Countess Jing\u2019an was only a few moments behind them.</p><br/><p>The couple from the main branch was also present. Madam Zou had a terrible expression on her face.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s eyes turned towards Chu Lian and He Changdi right after they came in. She calmly said, \u201cTake a seat. I\u2019ve called everyone here to conclude last night\u2019s incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch didn\u2019t say anything else. She looked like she was waiting for someone.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly found out who she was waiting for.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, Great Doctor Miao strode in, carrying his medicine box.</p><br/><p>After staying up for the whole night, Great Doctor Miao\u2019s complexion wasn\u2019t very good. However, he seemed to be in a rather relaxed mood. Based on his expression, Chu Lian could guess that Miaozhen and her child were already fine.</p><br/><p>As expected, Great Doctor Miao cupped his hands together in a greeting when he entered the parlour. He stroked his white beard as he said, \u201cMiss Miaozhen is fine now. If she takes in proper nourishment and takes care of her health in the coming days, she will be able to give birth to her child without any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He and Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s faces were naturally filled with joy after hearing his report.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was all thanks to Great Doctor Miao,\u201d Matriarch He bowed to express her humble gratitude.</p><br/><p>However, Great Doctor Miao\u2019s expression remained rather blas\u00e9. There wasn\u2019t any fear on his face as he remarked, \u201cThis old man thinks that the matriarch is thanking the wrong person. The one you should thank is Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

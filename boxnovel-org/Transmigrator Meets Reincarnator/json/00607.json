She only knew that Chu Lian had been rather anxious these few days, but she had no clue what the root of it was.</p><br/><p>The moment He Changdi had stepped out of the bedroom, the seemingly asleep Chu Lian had opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>She blinked and looked up at the canopy above her dazedly. There was fear muddling her clear gaze. Yesterday had marked the end of the knowledge she had about the events in the Great Wu Dynasty\u2026</p><br/><p>She had only read the book halfway, so she had no idea what was in store for her in the later half.</p><br/><p>This was the same as a sniper entering a foreign land losing their map and knowledge. The situation affected her mood, making her lose all sense of safety and letting her fears and insecurities take over.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sucked in a deep breath. The lost look in her eyes slowly changed into one of determination.</p><br/><p>She believed that she would be able to live just as well even without her cheat guiding her.</p><br/><p>After letting go of the worries that had been burdening her, Chu Lian\u2019s mood became more relaxed.</p><br/><p>Thinking back over the past year, even though she had known about the events about to happen, He Changdi had always acted out of her expectations. Not everything had gone according to the book\u2019s original plan either and she hadn\u2019t been able to avoid the major events of the story.</p><br/><p>Thus, she had only been torturing herself for nothing with her thoughts and worries over the past few days.</p><br/><p>After her reflection, she realised that having foreknowledge of the future didn\u2019t make any difference anyway. It was good enough as long as she remained true to herself.</p><br/><p>Now that she had finally thought things through, she recalled how forward she had been with He Changdi. Her face instantly flushed.</p><br/><p>She called out for a servant, and Wenqing entered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing carefully looked over Third Young Madam and found that her complexion was a rosy pink and that her almond-shaped eyes were curved into crescents. The handmaid understood that her master\u2019s mood had improved vastly. Her worry for her master vanished. When Third Young Master had seen how unhappy Third Young Madam had been, he looked like he was going to punish all the servants of Songtao Court!</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying to Third Young Madam, Third Young Master is in the study. Would you like to go there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian thought for a moment and nodded.</p><br/><p>Wenqing helped her into a silver and red five-layer full length gown and specially picked out some matching pearl accessories for her hair, giving Chu Lian a clean and elegant appearance.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was in the middle of some deep thinking with his eyes shut. He rubbed the jade ring on his thumb subconsciously as he did so.</p><br/><p>When he heard the sound of the door being opened, his eyes slowly fluttered open.</p><br/><p>To his surprise, Chu Lian entered the room. The smile on her face was like the sun, casting away the gloominess hanging over him.</p><br/><p>He Changdi beckoned Chu Lian over, and she quickly walked up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come over by yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t any open documents in front of He Sanlang. The inkwell next to him was also dry, so it was clear that he wasn\u2019t in the middle of sorting out some official business.</p><br/><p>With a gentle tug of his arm, He Changdi pulled Chu Lian onto his lap.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian made a token struggle before giving in to his wishes.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was tall and long-limbed, whereas Chu Lian was much smaller in size. Sitting obediently in his lap, she looked like a cute little \u2018daughter\u2019 instead.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang wound a loose lock of her hair on his finger as he spoke to her in a low, magnetic voice, \u201cWhat should we prepare as a gift for the Thousand Blessings Festival?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had been focused on her own thoughts over the past two days, so she hadn\u2019t given much thought to it. Now He Changdi\u2019s question reminded her that the Emperor\u2019s birthday was approaching.</p><br/><p>It was the Emperor\u2019s fiftieth birthday this year, and even the Empress Dowager had ordered for a grand celebration to be held.</p><br/><p>The ranked noble ladies would have to enter the palace for the banquet.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just He Changdi who had to prepare a gift, she had to prepare something in her capacity as Honoured Lady Jinyi as well.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian saw that he was frowning from contemplation, so she asked, \u201cDo you have something in mind already?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi put an arm around Chu Lian\u2019s slender waist, the corner of his mouth tilting upwards, \u201cHow about the Snow Mountain Mists flower?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chengping Emperor ruled over the vast lands of the Great Wu. He didn\u2019t need money in the least, so their gifts had to be something more than just valuable.</p><br/><p>He and his wife weren\u2019t close to the Emperor at all and weren\u2019t certain of his likes and dislikes. Thus, they could only pick some interesting treasures as gifts.</p><br/><p>There was still a single flower left after using the rest of the Snow Mountain Mists flowers for Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s medicine. From what Great Doctor Miao had said, the Snow Mountain Mists flowers were more precious than hundred-year-old ginseng or <i>lingzhi</i> mushrooms. While they weren\u2019t so powerful as to be a cure-all, they were invaluable as the main ingredients to cure many deep-seated illnesses.</p><br/><p>This information had been passed down from Great Doctor Miao\u2019s teacher. Even the imperial physicians in the palace had no idea about the medicinal uses of the Snow Mountains Mists flower.</p><br/><p>Such a unique medicinal ingredient would be more than enough as a birthday gift for the Emperor.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pondered it for a bit before nodding, \u201cLuckily we had one stalk left. This gift is much better than presenting some other treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, the couple decided on their gift for the Emperor\u2019s birthday feast.</p><br/><p>He Changdi saw that she was in higher spirits, so he teased her, \u201cLian\u2019er, have you decided on what you\u2019re going to give the Emperor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian showed him a cunning smile, \u201cIt\u2019s much simpler for me. I\u2019ll just cook a dish for him and bring it into the palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang poked the tip of her nose in response. He suddenly turned serious and said, \u201cOnce the Thousand Blessings Festival is over, we\u2019ll move out of this estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian abruptly sat upright with her eyes wide in disbelief, \u201cReally? You\u2019ve already discussed it with Father?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi nodded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

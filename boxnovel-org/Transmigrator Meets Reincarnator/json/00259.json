Looking at how thin it was, there was most likely only a single sheet of paper inside. Didn\u2019t Third Young Madam have any sweet nothings to say to Third Young Master?</p><br/><p>Third Young Master\u2019s letter had been so much thicker!</p><br/><p>As the manservant carried the package on his back and left Songtao Court, his lips were pressed together tightly. This letter was way too thin! How was he going to report this to his mother later?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Third Young Madam way too relaxed? Wasn\u2019t she worried that Third Young Master would fall for other women while he was away?</p><br/><p>Even though she had been given the chance, she hadn\u2019t tried to bond more with her husband. Third Young Madam was still too young!</p><br/><p>If this manservant were to find out how He Sanlang had been passing his days at the northern border, he probably wouldn\u2019t be thinking like that.</p><br/><p>Once House Jing\u2019an\u2019s letters and packages had been sent to Prince Jin, they still had to be brought to the northern border through Prince Jin\u2019s connections before they could reach He Sanlang\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>In Prince Jin\u2019s study, he was currently pacing about in the room with his hands behind his back. His uncommon azure eyes were shining under the light of the candles illuminating the space. After a short moment\u2019s wait, the sound of footsteps could be heard from outside the study.</p><br/><p>When the footsteps stopped, a rough voice called out, \u201cThis subordinate greets Prince Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man carrying a sword at his waist, dressed in a black robe that flared widely at the ends entered the room. He walked straight up to Prince Jin\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you carried out the tasks that this prince has entrusted to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The square-faced man tensed and knelt down on one knee next to Prince Jin. \u201cThis subordinate is useless. This subordinate hasn\u2019t found the person that Your Highness is searching for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin sighed and walked over to his desk. He took a seat and picked up the small brush that had already been dipped in ink. Then, he set the brush to paper with vigorous and lively movements. After a few moments, he lifted his brush and let the paper dry before inserting it into an envelope.</p><br/><p>He placed the letter into the package from House Jing\u2019an and stood up before giving orders to the man in black. \u201cSend this to the Eagle team. They\u2019ll know what to do. As for the other matter this prince has entrusted to you, continue investigating. You must find that person as soon as you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the black-robed man left with the letter and package, Prince Jin sat back down behind his desk with his brows drawn together. Even though He Changdi was one of his most trusted brothers, he still found it hard to believe what He Changdi had written in his letter.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an had been ill for more than twenty years. Could that wandering traveller called Miao really treat her sickness?</p><br/><p>Of course, Prince Jin didn\u2019t know that it was this Great Doctor Miao who had been the one to treat the Chengping Emperor when he had been afflicted with an incurable illness in He Changdi\u2019s past life. Xiao Bojian had been the one to recommend this doctor to treat the Emperor, extending the Emperor\u2019s life for five more years.</p><br/><p>Later on, when Count Jing\u2019an had met this Great Doctor Miao, he had described his- by then deceased- wife\u2019s symptoms to this doctor. Great Doctor Miao had then personally declared that Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s illness could be cured completely. After treatment, her body would simply be a little weaker than most.</p><br/><p>Back then, when the newly returned Count Jing\u2019an had learned of this news, he had locked himself in his study for three whole days and nights. It was also due to this abnormal action from Count Jing\u2019an that the He Family had all learned that Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s illness could have been treated. They simply hadn\u2019t been able to meet the right doctor at the right time.</p><br/><p>The tenth of October was Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s forty-fifth birthday.</p><br/><p>Although it didn\u2019t mark the end of another decade of life, it was about halfway.</p><br/><p>Additionally, Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s health had always been rather poor. Her situation had also been getting worse in the recent months; perhaps due to the lower quality of medicinal herbs or some other reason.</p><br/><p>These few days, she hadn\u2019t been able to get up from bed at all.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was extremely worried. Her son and his wife were very close. However, her son was currently guarding the border at Mingzhou. If anything were to happen to his wife, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to meet her one last time. What were they going to do in that case?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, it wasn\u2019t just Count Jing\u2019an who was far away from the estate. There was also that little rebel Sanlang out there!</p><br/><p>Matriarch He wanted to use Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s birthday as a chance to celebrate and cheer her up a little.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t send out many invites to the celebration. She only invited the noble madams and ladies that their House was closer to.</p><br/><p>She also sent a letter to her second grandson, He Changjue, who was still serving in the Left Military Guards, asking him to return home that day for a meal.</p><br/><p>He Changjue normally stayed away from home out of fear that his senior family members would try to force him to marry. Thus, he usually stayed in the Left Military Guard barracks even on rest days.</p><br/><p>However, this time, it was his mother\u2019s birthday. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid returning home. He switched shifts with one of his comrades and rushed home early on the day itself with his mother\u2019s birthday present.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had already prepared her present much earlier. It was a pearl headdress that she had personally designed and specially requested one of Jinshi Pavilion\u2019s master craftsmen to make.</p><br/><p>Pearls were good for the health and suited Countess Jing\u2019an more than those blinding precious stones.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the headdress design that Chu Lian had come up with was completely new to the Great Wu Dynasty. Fresh and elegant, they were most suited for a forty-five-year-old noble madam to wear.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia was coming to the celebration today too. They had agreed on it beforehand. If she hadn\u2019t been afraid to steal the spotlight at Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s birthday banquet, Princess Wei would have also liked to come!</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, Royal Princess Duanjia was escorted to House Jing\u2019an\u2019s entrance by her estate\u2019s guards.</p><br/><p>Chu Liu had said that she would personally cook breakfast for her if she arrived early.</p><br/><p>Even though Royal Princess Duanjia knew that Chu Liu was a foodie, she hadn\u2019t actually seen her cook with her own eyes yet!</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia had been waiting forever for this day. Thus, when getting off her carriage, she was a little rash in her actions.</p><br/><p>She tried to jump off the carriage before it had even come to a complete stop. In the next instant, all she could hear was the bellow of a horse as the world turned into a flurry of motion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

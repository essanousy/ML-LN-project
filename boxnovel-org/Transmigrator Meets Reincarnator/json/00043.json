She raised her chin as she said guardedly, \u201cWhat are you asking that for?! Don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re not getting fed while serving Third Young Master. He got two whole boxes of food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she had been snubbed by Laiyue before, she couldn\u2019t help sounding a little mocking as she talked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat had nothing to do with me.\u201d Laiyue pointed towards the study behind him. \u201cIt was all Third Young Master\u2019s orders. I haven\u2019t eaten anything since afternoon, I\u2019m so hungry that my front is probably stuck to my back right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he finished speaking, Laiyue\u2019s stomach grumbled.</p><br/><p>Xiyan gave him a good look, as if trying to tell if he was lying.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Xiyan, we\u2019re all servants, you can\u2019t possibly not know! No servant eats together with their master!\u201d Laiyue was good at talking, and he managed to find Xiyan\u2019s weak spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you really didn\u2019t eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really haven\u2019t eaten! See, my stomach\u2019s even growling! You heard that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan pursed her lips and placed the boxes of food down on a stone table nearby. She took out some leftover rice and dishes from inside. \u201cThere\u2019s not much left anyway. There\u2019s only a few pieces of braised meat, soup and a bowl of rice. Just take it to hold off your hunger for now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue swallowed visibly, \u201cIt\u2019s good enough as long as it\u2019s edible. I\u2019m not too picky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan glared at him and poured the soup and pieces of meat onto the bowl of rice. It looked exactly like the modern meal, braised meat with rice.</p><br/><p>She pushed the bowl to Laiyue, \u201cHere, take it! Remember to give the bowl and chopsticks to the old servant in the kitchen to wash when you\u2019re done!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue nodded furiously. Xiyan felt annoyed by his happy expression, so she took the boxes of food and quickly walked away.</p><br/><p>Those who have eaten braised meat would know that the gravy alone was delicious when poured over white rice.</p><br/><p>Laiyue\u2019s nose twitched as he realised that the fragrance he had smelled before had come from this dish. What had Xiyan called it just now? That\u2019s right, braised meat!</p><br/><p>Laiyue was really hungry by now. He squatted right at the entrance of the study with the bowl of food and gulped down the rice like a peasant farmer, with completely no dignity to speak of.</p><br/><p>Even so, he had never eaten such a comfortable meal before. For some reason, he just found this dish unbelievably tasty!</p><br/><p>He picked up a piece of braised meat with his chopsticks and watched it wobble before he stuffed it into his mouth. That amazing flavour spread on his tastebuds; it was a hundred times tastier than venison!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there was just too little braised meat left over. He finished it all in a few bites, it wasn\u2019t enough for him at all.</p><br/><p>Those darned maidservants were too greedy, they ate so much and left so little for him.</p><br/><p>Laiyue kept thinking about the food. If there was a whole plate of braised meat in front of him right now, he would definitely be able to finish it all by himself. Furthermore, it would definitely be sparkling clean once he was done.</p><br/><p>After having another two mouthfuls of rice soaked in the gravy from the braised meat, Laiyue\u2019s eyes closed in bliss as he savoured the taste of the rice in his mouth before swallowing.</p><br/><p>He finished half of the large bowl of gravy-covered rice very quickly.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the hardworking He Sanlang in the study was being tortured by the faint fragrance of the braised meat. In the end, he couldn\u2019t bear with it any longer. He threw down the book in his hands and walked out of the study. The moment he opened the door, he saw his personal manservant squatting at the entrance like a beggar, wolfing down a bowl of rice.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, the fragrance emanating from the bowl in his hands was the one that was torturing him in the study.</p><br/><p>He Changdi narrowed his eyes and stared at Laiyue with the corners of his lips curled up.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

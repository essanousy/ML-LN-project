Besides, I\u2019ve returned safely, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since Consort Liang had adopted him, Prince Jin had addressed her as Mother, just like Second Prince did.</p><br/><p>Hearing Prince Jin\u2019s words of consolation, Consort Liang made great efforts to hold back her tears. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Ah Yi, I was overthinking things. Come, both of you, take a seat! I\u2019ll have the food served up now. I cooked dinner myself today, so the two of you had better eat more!\u201d</p><br/><p>The servants quickly laid out the dishes, and the \u2018happy family\u2019 sat around the table. It was part of palace etiquette to stay silent while eating, so it was a quiet meal.</p><br/><p>Consort Liang didn\u2019t eat much herself, but she repeatedly filled the bowls of the princes with food.</p><br/><p>After dinner, Consort Liang had her attendant bring out a brand new robe.</p><br/><p>She pulled Prince Jin over and said with a wide smile, \u201cHere, try this on, see if it fits you. I made this for you last year, but since you didn\u2019t return for the new year, it\u2019s been in storage until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin accepted Consort Liang\u2019s kindness as per usual.</p><br/><p>Off to the side, Crown Prince added enviously, \u201cFourth Brother, I bet you didn\u2019t know that Mother only made a robe for you. I didn\u2019t get one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Consort Liang immediately smacked the crown prince\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat are you saying! You\u2019ve already formed a family, so if you want a robe, get your wife to make one for you. Ah Yi is still all alone. As his mother, I obviously have to shower him with more love.\u201d</p><br/><p>When it was close to midnight, Prince Jin finally returned to his estate.</p><br/><p>His aide who followed closely behind him held the new robe up with both hands and asked, \u201cYour Highness, shall I pass this robe to <i>momo</i> for keeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin\u2019s voice suddenly turned cold and sinister. \u201cBurn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>His aide was stunned by the unexpected reaction, but he immediately complied. The aide quickly had someone bring forth a brazier and he tossed the robe that they brought back from Consort Liang\u2019s place straight into the fire.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin stood beside his own bed. As there was nothing lit in the room, only the silver-white moonlight that shone through the windows gave light to Prince Jin\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>In his mind, the reminder that Consort Liang had given him before he left resounded over and over.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yi, your Second Brother isn\u2019t as capable as you are, so please help him as much as possible in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hmph! Help him?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was in the middle of drinking honey water in her courtyard when Xiyan rushed in with a smile on her face.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glanced at her and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is it good news?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan nodded like a chick picking rice grains off the ground. \u201cThird Young Madam, I heard that Guilin Restaurant is closing down soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nearly spit out all the honey water in her mouth.</p><br/><p>What? That was way faster than she expected!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even without her at the helm of Guilin Restaurant, it shouldn\u2019t have shut down so quickly. Before she had taken it over, Guilin Restaurant had been constantly in the red, but it had never been at the risk of closing down.</p><br/><p>Xiyan came closer to her and whispered, \u201cI heard that there were nobles in the capital who wrote letters of complaint.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfft\u2026</p><br/><p>It suddenly dawned upon Chu Lian. No wonder Lady Yang had sent her a letter two days ago. She had questions about Guilin Restaurant, so Chu Lian had tactfully replied that Guilin Restaurant was now back in the hands of the matriarch, and that she was no longer managing it.</p><br/><p>That made sense though. Back when Guilin Restaurant had first reopened, the main market of consumers she targeted had been the capital\u2019s upper class. Now that the management of Guilin Restaurant had been swapped out, the ones who bore the brunt of it were the nobles. Matriarch He may have some authority in the capital, but it was nothing when going against the higher ranking nobility. Guilin Restaurant\u2019s permanent closure was something that would have happened sooner or later.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was definitely their He Family\u2019s child and not some wild bastard.</p><br/><p>Once she got the news, the matriarch went into the ancestral hall to offer up incense with the help of Senior Servant Liu.</p><br/><p>Although she was already a bag of old bones, she insisted on kneeling for two whole hours, begging for Chu Lian\u2019s first child to be a boy\u2026</p><br/><p>Even Senior Servant Liu couldn\u2019t move her from her prayers.</p><br/><p>When she returned from the ancestral hall, Matriarch He started preparing things for her unborn great-grandson.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu noticed that the old matriarch wouldn\u2019t sit still and tried to coax her, \u201cMatriarch, you don\u2019t have to be so rushed. There\u2019s still another six months to go! Furthermore, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be a little girl or boy. If you prepare the wrong items, then it will go to waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch\u2019s expression turned fierce upon hearing such words from Senior Servant Liu, \u201cWhat nonsense are you speaking? Of course it\u2019s going to be a little boy. Senior Servant Zhou, follow my instructions and prepare all the items for boys!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu had no choice but to follow along with what Matriarch He wanted.</p><br/><p>While the servants were busying themselves, Muxiang stood still in shock like a statue.</p><br/><p>She ran back to her own room in a panic and locked the door.</p><br/><p>Once the door was shut, she could no longer hide the resentful and sinister expression on her face.</p><br/><p>From an obedient maidservant, she changed into a demon who had just crawled up from hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this! It wasn\u2019t supposed to be\u2026!\u201d She leaned bonelessly against the door, sliding down into a squat. She grabbed at her hair, her eyes staring wildly into space, as if she couldn\u2019t accept the news she had just heard.</p><br/><p>In her past life, she hadn\u2019t had any children since she hadn\u2019t consummated her marriage with He Changdi. After she had gotten together with Xiao Bojian, although the two of them had gone to bed together many times, she hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant.</p><br/><p>She had always thought that it was her body that wasn\u2019t fertile, and she had always held some regret.</p><br/><p>When she opened her eyes and realised that she had been reincarnated into one of Matriarch He\u2019s maidservants, she had first felt cold hard fear. Later on, that had been mixed with a thread of elatement, as this body was perfectly healthy. In the future, when she got He Changdi back again, she could give birth to their children.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the lack of any good news from the current Chu Lian and He Changdi after they had been married for so long had proven her guess from her past life.</p><br/><p>However, how had this happened!? Wasn\u2019t her old body supposed to be infertile? How had that imposter gotten pregnant with He Changdi\u2019s child?</p><br/><p>How could it be!</p><br/><p>She was the only one in the world who could bear children for He Changdi!</p><br/><p>The more Muxiang thought about it, the angrier she was. Slowly, that anger was mixed with depression. She wanted to rush over to Chu Lian right now and tear her into pieces.</p><br/><p>Why!? How! That body was hers!</p><br/><p>She was the one who was supposed to marry He Changdi!</p><br/><p>How could that monstrous imposter use her body and take her husband and live so happily?!</p><br/><p>In her extreme rage, Muxiang destroyed everything she could move in her room.</p><br/><p>When she was done, she laid panting over the desk, her eyes bitterly cold as she looked at the bits and pieces of the broken things on the floor.</p><br/><p>She looked like a viper eyeing her prey and wanting it dead!</p><br/><p>That monster had stolen away her body\u2026 She wasn\u2019t going to let it go so easily!</p><br/><p>When He Changdi returned in the evening, Chu Lian had already ordered the servants to prepare everything.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an and Chu Lian sat in the same carriage, while He Changdi rode his horse alongside them and the guards all the way back to the old residence.</p><br/><p>They had already made a promise with the rest of the family that they would meet at the Jing\u2019an Estate tonight. Even He Changjue had returned early.</p><br/><p>Once they got to the Jing\u2019an Estate, Chu Lian and He Changdi bowed in greeting to Matriarch He and Count Jing\u2019an, before taking their seats at the large round table in the center of the parlour.</p><br/><p>This intimate family banquet was bathed in a joyous and harmonious atmosphere. Even Matriarch He didn\u2019t make any sour comments.</p><br/><p>When they were done, the family moved to the parlour of Qingxi Hall to have tea and chat.</p><br/><p>Now that Chu Lian was pregnant, Matriarch He\u2019s mood seemed to be much better.</p><br/><p>He Changdi hadn\u2019t returned to the old residence in some time as well, so Matriarch He pulled him alongside her to catch up.</p><br/><p>Seeing that He Changdi had become much thinner, the matriarch\u2019s heart ached for her youngest grandson.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you, why don\u2019t you know how to take care of yourself outside? You\u2019ve become so thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stiffened up a little, but she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>While Matriarch He might not have meant anything by her words, it didn\u2019t sound like that to the others.</p><br/><p>It sounded like the matriarch was blaming her granddaughter-in-law for not taking good care of her husband and allowing him to get so thin from overworking.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s cool and handsome face didn\u2019t change at all. When he spoke, it was in his usual low tones.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, you must be mistaken. I haven\u2019t lost weight at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it was rare that He Changdi would return to visit them, the matriarch didn\u2019t contest his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, you haven\u2019t gotten thinner at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an followed up to smooth out the awkwardness in the air, \u201cIt looks like Sanlang has gotten even more muscular than before. Mother, you don\u2019t have to worry at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The family continued chatting happily. Count Jing\u2019an didn\u2019t say much, but his gaze was full of satisfaction and affection when looking at his youngest son and daughter-in-law.</p><br/><p>Just as the family was enjoying the peaceful atmosphere, the matriarch suddenly spoke up, \u201cSanlang, Sanlang\u2019s wife, since you\u2019ve already moved out, then so be it. I can\u2019t stop you anyway. In the past, it didn\u2019t matter much that it was only the two of you in your estate, but things are different now. Sanlang\u2019s wife is pregnant, we can\u2019t be careless with this. I\u2019m too old and I can\u2019t walk well now, so I can\u2019t move over to your estate. However, I can\u2019t rest easy with the two of you so far away. I thought over this for some time, and I\u2019ve decided to send Muxiang back with you. She can serve Sanlang\u2019s wife and report her condition to me. I\u2019ll feel more reassured this way.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

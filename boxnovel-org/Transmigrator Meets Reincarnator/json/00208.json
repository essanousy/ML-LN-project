She couldn\u2019t have imagined that the problem laid with Old Duke Zheng. Apparently, he was currently bedridden and refusing food and drink.</p><br/><p>Those close to House Zheng knew that Old Duke Zheng was a glutton for food. He had visited most of the top-ranked restaurants in the capital. Ever since he had passed the duke\u2019s seat to his heir, Old Duke Zheng would travel far and wide each day to search for gourmet food. He had just returned home two months ago, but for some reason, he had completely lost his appetite. It was almost to the point that he was refusing to eat any food at all.</p><br/><p>When the reason behind her request was revealed, the two Duchesses Zheng looked at Chu Lian with hope in their eyes. Chu Lian was close to being embarrassed to be the focus of those expectant looks.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He hadn\u2019t thought that Old Duchess Zheng\u2019s request would turn out to be something like that. She didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry for the moment. She had no choice but to speak truthfully. \u201cOld Sister, I know that you\u2019re worried about Old Duke Zheng. I\u2019ll just speak honestly with you. Sanlang\u2019s wife does know how to make some interestingly new dishes, but we can\u2019t promise that we\u2019ll be able to solve your problem for you. We can only say that Sanlang\u2019s wife will try her best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye! Of course! As long as Honoured Lady Jinyi is willing to help out, I\u2019ll be endlessly grateful. We have simply run out of ideas. The old man isn\u2019t willing to eat anything at all. If this goes on, his body won\u2019t be able to hold on\u2026\u201d It was clear in her tone that Old Duchess Zheng was anxious.</p><br/><p>After they had finally gotten Chu Lian\u2019s agreement and Matriarch He promised to help out with Old Duchess Zheng\u2019s request, they set the visit to the Zheng Estate to be three days later.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wanted to hide her face in her hands but didn\u2019t know whether to start sobbing or laughing her heart out. Old Duke Zheng had passed away about two months later from now in the original story. Had the cause of his death truly been from refusing food after not being able to taste the gourmet food he had wanted?</p><br/><p>When they reached the point where their paths home diverged, Old Duchess Zheng bid her farewells and led her daughter-in-law back to their own carriage.</p><br/><p>Now only Matriarch He and Chu Lian were left in the carriage.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He petted Chu Lian\u2019s fair and tender hand gently, \u201cLian\u2019er, you\u2019ve done us a great service today. Otherwise, our house would have completely lost its reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian realised that the matriarch liked to call her \u2018Lian\u2019er\u2019 when they were talking in private.</p><br/><p>She smiled, \u201cGrandmother, don\u2019t say that. I\u2019m also a part of House Jing\u2019an, I was just doing my part for our House.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard Chu Lian\u2019s answer, Matriarch He was even more gratified. \u201cYou silly child. It\u2019s been hard for you. It\u2019s not all your eldest sister-in-law\u2019s fault today, so don\u2019t hold a grudge against her. Grandmother knows that it\u2019s not easy for her either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian felt a slight pang of shock. She hadn\u2019t expected the matriarch to think that she might hold a grudge. \u201cWe\u2019re all one big family. What is there to hold a grudge against? Eldest Sister-in-law couldn\u2019t have known that she would lose the round cakes like that. We still need Eldest Sister-in-law to manage our household in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother knows. Your eldest sister-in-law has been treating you too harshly recently. Don\u2019t worry, Grandmother will remind her of her duties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tried her best to suppress the fright in her heart. She didn\u2019t realise that Matriarch He had those sorts of thoughts in her mind. Did she think that Chu Lian had come out to save the day and bring glory to the family just to slap Madam Zou in the face for mistreating her?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sighed inwardly and felt fatigue coming over her. No wonder the older generations liked to say that communication was the most important. Chu Lian felt that it would be much better for her if she were to clear the misunderstanding with Matriarch He right now, rather than to let it persist and affect her later on.</p><br/><p>She looked up at the matriarch; her almond-shaped eyes shone with intelligence under the dim lighting of the lanterns within the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, there\u2019s an order of seniority in the family. It was Granddaughter-in-Law\u2019s fortune to be able to marry into the He Family. Granddaughter-in-Law doesn\u2019t have much ambition or talent, and would just like to live out peaceful days while making some delicious food. If it earns some income, then that\u2019s even better. Granddaughter-in-Law is very lazy. After doing all those, Granddaughter-in-Law would rather take a nap in the courtyard or give Grandmother some company. Although Sanlang is from the main line of inheritance, he\u2019s the third son after all. There are two older brothers above him, and Granddaughter-in-Law ranks the lowest in this family, of course. When some time passes, maybe we might even have Second Sister-in-Law joining the family!\u201d</p><br/><p>What Chu Lian wanted to say was that she really didn\u2019t want to be in control of the household, and she didn\u2019t have any intention at all to oust Eldest Brother-in-Law and Eldest Sister-in-law from their places in the family.</p><br/><p>As she watched the young girl before her saying out all those words, Matriarch He\u2019s sharp eyes grew ever brighter. In the end, she sighed and patted Chu Lian\u2019s hand. \u201cGrandmother has blamed you unjustly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian finally relaxed inwardly. She had spoken her true thoughts just now. It was better to be a layabout. Who would want to crack their brains thinking about how to support a noble house all day? As well as thinking of how to socialise with the various other noble houses in the capital?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled and shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Grandmother. Our hearts are all hidden in our chests. Even the wisest man wouldn\u2019t be able to see into human hearts. Granddaughter-in-Law just hopes that Grandmother can voice out any problems first, rather than keeping it inside. Granddaughter-in-Law will definitely change for the better!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being frank and sincere, as well as opening your heart, was the best way to communicate.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had no desire to play twisted mind games with others.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He found that she was starting to like this granddaughter-in-law of hers even more, after this honest talk with her in the carriage.</p><br/><p>She reached out to poke Chu Lian in the forehead. \u201cYou silly girl! Don\u2019t think that Grandmother can\u2019t see through your thoughts! You just want to laze at home all day. Although your eldest sister-in-law is around to take care of the family, you can\u2019t be too lazy either, since you\u2019re the lady-in-charge for your branch of the family. In the future, when all of us seniors aren\u2019t around anymore, you and Sanlang will have to separate your branch of the family and live on your own. If you don\u2019t know how to do anything at all, how are you going to manage your own house in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Chu Lian had cleared away the doubts in Matriarch He\u2019s heart, she started to act cutely like a child towards the matriarch. Matriarch He was the first senior who had treated her well since she had come to the Great Wu Dynasty, so she had already taken this affable old woman to be her real grandmother in her heart.</p><br/><p>She leaned against Matriarch He\u2019s side and replied in a playful tone, \u201cBut Grandmother will still be around to help Granddaughter-in-Law out~ When Sanlang and I leave the estate to create our own household, Grandmother has to come along too! Otherwise, Granddaughter-in-Law won\u2019t be able to manage a household without Grandmother! The servants will make fun of me then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little imp! Since you already know that, why are you still trying to think of ways to skive all day?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

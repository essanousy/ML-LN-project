Despite the Matriarch\u2019s attempt at acting as per normal, she had still been able to sense that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>When someone truly cared for you, you would be able to sense it in their gaze, their actions, their words.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Chu Lian who had this feeling, He Changdi felt the same.</p><br/><p>His brows wrinkled slightly and he thought of the movements in the estate for the past two days.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had suffered on the trip to the north and she had even succeeded in bringing back the medicinal ingredient needed to cure his mother. Grandmother wasn\u2019t an unreasonable person, so she should be treating Chu Lian even more dearly. Why had she become cold and distant instead?</p><br/><p>There had to be some external factor influencing her.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s pupils dilated as he sunk deep into his thoughts. When a sudden notion came to him, his eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>After his past life, He Changdi knew how important it was to make sure that there were no conflicts between even the closest of families. Otherwise, the gaps in their hearts would give rise to internal family troubles.</p><br/><p>Grandmother was aging and his aunt was right by her side. Many things were different from his past life.</p><br/><p>He comforted his wife by stroking her back with his palm. Resolution formed a decision in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, what do you think happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s brows formed a frown. She sat up and straightened her posture before sharing her analysis, \u201cHubby, could it be\u2026 Uncle Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang looked at her with undisguised admiration, as they had reached the same conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about this, I\u2019ll handle it. As for Grandmother, she\u2019s old and may have become muddleheaded, don\u2019t take her actions to heart. I\u2019m the one who you\u2019re spending the rest of your life with, not her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian knew that He Sanlang was right, but feeling alienated from the matriarch for no reason left a bad taste in her mouth. In the past, she may not have cared about this, but since she wanted to pass her days happily with He Changdi and help him manage the family, it was hard for her to stay positive.</p><br/><p>As a granddaughter-in-law, she didn\u2019t want to be disliked by her grandmother-in-law.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian puffed up her cheeks and said, \u201cBut I\u2019m still unhappy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi understood his wife\u2019s train of thought. It was precisely because she cared about him that she wanted the approval of all of his relatives, and to be on equal footing with him.</p><br/><p>The caring consideration from his wife warmed He Sanlang\u2019s heart. Her cute and chubby puffed up cheeks gave him a sudden urge\u2026 He let out a low chuckle and pulled her closer. With just a simple tilt of his head, his lips were already covering her pout. He tasted her smooth and sweet lips before pushing past them and plundering her mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian ran out of air, she pushed at his chest and he finally released her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still have the strength to get angry now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s lips had turned red from his bullying. She glared at him with her clear eyes, \u201cHe Changdi, you\u2019re getting more and more out of hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s icy face broke into a smile that resembled a warm breeze.</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian was still displeased with him, she couldn\u2019t bear to spoil this relaxed expression of his.</p><br/><p>Now that she had become estranged from the matriarch, albeit through no fault of her own, he was the one stuck in the middle. Things would be tough for him in the future.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s heart ached for her grim-faced husband.</p><br/><p>She stroked He Sanlang\u2019s cheek and said softly, \u201cForget about it. I\u2019m not made of gold, so I can\u2019t be liked by everyone. I can\u2019t control how Grandmother thinks, but I\u2019ll be fine as long as my conscience is clear. You don\u2019t have to think too much about this, we\u2019re not living our lives for others to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang hadn\u2019t expected Chu Lian to be able to let the matter go. His heart was instantly enveloped in warmth that he had never felt before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

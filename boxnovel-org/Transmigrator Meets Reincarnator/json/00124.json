You must have heard my song, \u2018The Phoenix Seeks His Soulmate\u2019, just now. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s tone was full of tenderness, and his eyes were soft with affection.</p><br/><p>However, his words stirred up a wave of emotion in the heart of the woman sitting opposite him.</p><br/><p>What was going on!</p><br/><p>Why\u2026 Why was Xiao Bojian talking as if the two of them had made plans to meet here at this teahouse? She hadn\u2019t received any sort of communication from him though!</p><br/><p>Was Xiao Bojian pulling a bluff on her, or had something happened without her knowing?</p><br/><p>Also, he had been the one playing the song that almost put her to sleep?!</p><br/><p>Bro, you played it well, but I don\u2019t even know how to appreciate music like that!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wanted to cry. If she had known that something like this would happen, she wouldn\u2019t have agreed to go out with Royal Princess Duanjia.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s head lowered even further. Her voice was as tiny as a mosquito\u2019s as she said, \u201cIt was passable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon receiving an evaluation like this, Xiao Bojian\u2019s disappointment was clearly reflected in his eyes. However, he immediately put on a warm smile again and placed a small brocade box he had been carrying onto the table. Pushing it towards Chu Lian, he said, \u201cLian\u2019er, it\u2019s your birthday today. This is a birthday present that I\u2019ve prepared for you. Open it and see if you like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shot a glance at the plain brocade box on the table. She tried her hardest to hold back the twitching of her face. What was going on here? Her legitimate husband didn\u2019t mention her birthday at all, and had probably completely forgotten about it. However, this outsider came all the way up to her just to give her a present\u2026 Chu Lian wanted to roll her eyes at the heavens.</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath and tried her best to let him down gently. \u201cThank you for your kind thoughts, Mister Xiao, but I can\u2019t accept this gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s breathing slowed. There was a storm whirling in his eyes as he furrowed his brows. \u201cLian\u2019er, Brother Xiao has spent a lot of effort to prepare this especially for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian stared tensely at the woman sitting across from him; with her head lowered, he couldn\u2019t read her expression at all. He fisted his hands under his wide sleeves, feeling his fingernails pierce into the skin of his palms.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, why are you so afraid? Why haven\u2019t you looked at me yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>For the second time already, Chu Lian felt like crying. Who wanted to look at this darn pervert! If she could, she would have escaped already!</p><br/><p>The pressure of facing the book\u2019s original male lead, Xiao Bojian, was too much for her. It was much easier to face her crazy husband!</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, since you\u2019ve come here today, aren\u2019t you implying that you still have me, your Brother Xiao, in your heart? I know you were forced into these circumstances. Don\u2019t worry, leave it all to Brother Xiao. Someday, Brother Xiao will get you out of this.\u201d Near the end, Xiao Bojian\u2019s voice held a hint of ferocity.</p><br/><p>The way the vicious expression contorted his handsome features could send chills down anyone\u2019s spine.</p><br/><p>Xiyan had only caught a glimpse of it; she was so frightened that she ducked down and didn\u2019t dare to move again.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wanted to knock herself out with a block of tofu. Her heart was full of frustration from her suffering. If she had known that this idiot would be here at Defeng Teahouse, she wouldn\u2019t have come here even if they beat her to death!</p><br/><p>Bro, don\u2019t be like this. Could you be a little more normal? I\u2019m already married. Although my husband isn\u2019t really all that sane and even likes to act out, I have no intention of cheating at all! What\u2019s up with you, coming over here all sneaky and silent? Why are you so obsessed with trying to make me commit adultery?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pursed her lips and decided not to say anything in the end. She had a hunch that if Xiao Bojian discovered that she wasn\u2019t the real \u2018Chu Lian\u2019, he might go even crazier. Her life could very well be in danger. Thus, it was better to keep a low profile\u2026</p><br/><p>What kind of mess had the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 left for her to clean up?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

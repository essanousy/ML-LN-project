The corners of her lips curled up when she heard He Changdi\u2019s words, and she finally lifted up the tent flap to peer outside.</p><br/><p>The moment the flap was lifted, she met directly with the black pools of He Changdi\u2019s eyes, causing her to cough awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Although her lunatic husband was usually rather disagreeable, it seemed like he was able to see through deceptions when needed. He hadn\u2019t failed her expectations at all.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t realise that her eyes were bright and sparkly right now. If she looked at anyone right now with that seemingly shining expression, anyone would be able to tell that she was in an extremely good mood at the moment.</p><br/><p>Like a miniature sun, Chu Lian\u2019s smile seemed to cast bright rays on He Sanlang, driving away all the gloomy clouds that had just gathered in his heart.</p><br/><p>She seemed to be exuding a natural charisma, attracting his gaze to her without him even realising.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian looked down and noticed that a soldier was about to follow He Changdi\u2019s orders and throw away the clothes that Xiaoyan and the other female soldiers had been washing, she frowned and spoke up. \u201cDon\u2019t throw those away. Let them dry and give them to any soldiers who need more clothes for winter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The soldier hadn\u2019t expected Chu Lian to give him such an order. Although he had thought that it was a pity to throw away these perfectly good clothes, these were the captain\u2019s own clothes, so they didn\u2019t have any right to do anything else to them. The soldier turned to his superior officer with a questioning look.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s brows drew together as his lips formed a thin line. \u201cDo as Honoured Lady says.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the soldier heard that, he took away the basin of clothes with a happy smile.</p><br/><p>Xiaoyan and the others were standing in a hidden corner some distance away, watching the scene in front of He Changdi\u2019s tent. When Xiaoyan saw that the soldier was taking away the wet clothes and giving them away to other soldiers who needed them, her face contorted into an ugly expression.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew that He Sanlang had done that out of disdain for them.</p><br/><p>They were Sima Hui\u2019s subordinates. By doing so, wasn\u2019t he showing his contempt for Sima Hui as well?</p><br/><p>An indignant expression covered Xiaoyan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes were turned up into crescents as she looked up at the travel-worn He Sanlang. He was still wearing his cloak and helmet; it was clear that he had rushed straight over from the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in, it\u2019s too windy outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang paused before entering and struggled to keep his usual cold expression on. Unfortunately, after he passed under the raised tent flap and was met with the warm air within the tent, the tips of his ears reddened unconsciously.</p><br/><p>That cute, pink flush didn\u2019t match with his cool and handsome face at all.</p><br/><p>Once he entered the tent, He Changdi glanced towards Chu Lian\u2019s ankle twice. Following that, he took off his cloak, helmet and scabbard and passed them to the waiting Wenqing and Wenlan.</p><br/><p>Although his voice sounded the same and his tone seemed as icy as usual, anyone would be able to tell that there was a shred of concern in his question: \u201cHas your wound recovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s almond-shaped eyes were upturned in a smile as she stared at the tall He Sanlang. She had been feeling a little awkward earlier, but now she was feeling as thick-skinned as she could be.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can walk now, just not too quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long legs carried He Changdi over to Chu Lian\u2019s side in just three strides. He pushed aside the long hem of his robe and sat down next to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>The originally stiff and hard bed had suddenly turned into warm and soft bedding. The difference in his expectations made him freeze for a second. An instant of panic flashed across his normally calm and collected face.</p><br/><p>However, he quickly concealed his flustered emotions. His seemingly casual gaze brushed over Chu Lian for a moment, as if checking whether she had detected his moment of abnormality.</p><br/><p>His thin lips pressed together as he bent over, preparing to lift up Chu Lian\u2019s skirt.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

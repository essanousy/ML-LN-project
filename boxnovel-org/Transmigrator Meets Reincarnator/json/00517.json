She was still young. Her features were more mature as compared to the previous year. Now that she had lost some baby fat and gained a little more elegance and womanly grace, she seemed even more beautiful than before.</p><br/><p>When she smiled like this, in a mischievous and charming manner, no one could keep their eyes away from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hand it over to them! I\u2019m not that kind!\u201d</p><br/><p>The unexpectedly childish tone startled Senior Servant Zhong into a smile. Her unrest and unease washed away with her master\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Third Young Madam has a plan already? Then this old servant can stop worrying blindly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Third Young Madam was young, everyone in Songtao Court respected her, even an old servant like Senior Servant Zhong who was already halfway into her grave.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong smiled once again, \u201cSince that\u2019s so, this old servant won\u2019t disturb Third Young Madam any longer. This old servant will take her leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian waved in acknowledgement of Senior Servant Zhong\u2019s dismissal. When the old servant stood up, she seemed to have thought of something else as she spoke up again, \u201cThis old servant heard from Wenqing and Wenlan just now. Third Young Madam was injured in the north. Please do take care of nourishing your body and recovering from your old wound now that you\u2019re back. This old servant does not have many talents, but this old servant has studied fertility treatments for women before. Yesterday, this old servant also consulted with Great Doctor Miao on this matter. From today onwards, this old servant will help Third Young Madam with nourishing the body for fertility.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong was one of He Sanlang\u2019s servants, so there was nothing she had to be cautious about. Chu Lian nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong was happy to receive her agreement and quickly left the study, preparing to make some soup for Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Actually, Wenlan had told her about Third Young Master and Third Young Madam\u2019s nightly activities the past two nights. Third Young Master was brimming with vigour at his age, but Third Young Madam was much younger. Her body seemed so slender and fragile, it couldn\u2019t possibly bear the full force of Third Young Master\u2019s affections. She had to help Third Young Madam nourish her body so that the couple would be able to have a child as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wouldn\u2019t have expected Senior Servant Zhong\u2019s motives to be so complex. Once the old servant had left, Chu Lian had dived right back into her work. By the time dusk had fallen, she finally walked out of the little study and sent couriers off with letters and the designs for jewellery.</p><br/><p>Xiyan came over to her with an invitation in hand and a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was seated at the desk with Wenqing gently kneading her shoulders. She had holed herself up in the study for an entire afternoon, so her shoulders had gotten a little sore. Wenqing\u2019s massage was helping to relax them again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho sent that invite?\u201d Chu Lian glanced over at Xiyan as she asked.</p><br/><p>Xiyan presented the invitation respectfully to Chu Lian with both hands, \u201cThird Young Madam, it\u2019s from House Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was startled for a moment. After the whole incident with Miaozhen\u2019s miscarriage, she had almost forgotten that they had bumped into Chu Qizheng on the way back from the Wei Estate and what Chu Qizheng had said to them.</p><br/><p>She flipped open the invite and scanned through its contents.</p><br/><p>Heh, so it was for Chu Yuan\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony.</p><br/><p>She was about a year older than Chu Yuan, so it was indeed time for Eighth Miss Yuan to come of age.</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 and she didn\u2019t know much about what \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 had faced in the Ying Estate, her servants would mention the past from time to time, especially Xiyan and Senior Servant Gui who had been with her the longest.</p><br/><p>She recalled what Senior Servant Gui had told her.</p><br/><p>At the coming-of-age for this body of hers, no guests had been invited at all. It had been a simple dinner with family where her elders had taken care of all the ceremonial steps. Although she hadn\u2019t thought much of it since she hadn\u2019t experienced it personally, the corners of Senior Servant Gui\u2019s eyes would turn red whenever she spoke of it.</p><br/><p>Now looking at the gold-embossed invite for Chu Yuan\u2019s ceremony, it was clear that the difference of treatment for both of Chu Qizheng\u2019s daughters was like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Xiyan was standing right next to Chu Lian, so she could see the contents of the invite as well. When Third Young Madam remained silent, she assumed that her master was thinking of past memories and her eyes slowly filled up with hot tears.</p><br/><p>She wanted to tell Third Young Madam not to go, but this was Eight Miss Yuan\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony. As terrible as the days at the Ying Estate had been for Sixth Miss, she was still Eighth Miss\u2019s older sister. She couldn\u2019t choose not to go after receiving an invite.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Madam\u2026\u201d Xiyan called out to Chu Lian worriedly.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian returned to her senses and set the invite down on the table. When she turned to look and saw that her silly handmaid was already close to tears, she found it a little funny. She teased Xiyan, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Who bullied you? Tell me who it was and I\u2019ll serve justice for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mischievous grin on Chu Lian showed how little she had been affected by the invite.</p><br/><p>Xiyan hurriedly shook her head and squeezed out an awkward smile, \u201cNo, no, this servant is fine. No one dares to bully this servant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shot a mock glare at her, \u201cThen why are you crying? Go wash it off with some warm water. You\u2019re already an adult, why are you still such a crybaby?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xiyan left, Senior Servant Gui piped up, \u201cThird Young Madam, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on Chu Lian\u2019s current status, it really was as Senior Servant Gui said. No one would hold her to it or gossip about her if she didn\u2019t go. However, it was her maiden house that had sent the invite. If she refused to socialise with them at all, others might not mention it to her face, but they would still look down on her behind her back.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blinked innocently, \u201cOf course I\u2019m going. I\u2019m doing so well for myself, why wouldn\u2019t I go?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, she winked playfully at Senior Servant Gui.</p><br/><p>When Senior Servant Gui got over her startlement, she broke out into a smile as well.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. There was no reason for Third Young Madam not to go. Out of all the misses in House Ying, the house she had married into was the most highly ranked. Furthermore, Third Young Master was completely devoted to Third Young Madam. He had even received the title of marquis recently, together with an important position at court. With these conditions, what did Third Young Madam have to fear when returning to the Ying Estate?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

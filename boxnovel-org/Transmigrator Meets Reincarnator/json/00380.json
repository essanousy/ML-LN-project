Even if they tried to plant some crops, the harvest would be dismal. That was why the disgusting Chinese olive porridge was so precious to the people here.</p><br/><p>Since grain crops couldn\u2019t survive in the northern border, fruit trees were a mere dream.</p><br/><p>This was also winter. Even in the capital, the types of fruit available in the middle of winter were just some frozen pears or tangerines.</p><br/><p>Even Chu Lian, who seemed to have prepared an entire larder for herself, hadn\u2019t brought any fresh fruits with her. When she was craving for some fruit, the most she could do was to have some candied kumquats.</p><br/><p>Thus, when Sima Hui served up some juicy and sweet sugarcane, she was overwhelmed by the luxurious treat.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian knew perfectly well what the soldiers in the camp were going through now.</p><br/><p>When Xiaoju saw that Honoured Lady Jinyi was looking at the white porcelain dish containing the sugarcane with surprise, she smiled and explained, \u201cThe general brought these over from Su City. Since the weather hasn\u2019t been very good, some of the sugarcane was spoiled by the frost. The only ones we have left are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian heard that, she didn\u2019t feel like eating the sugarcane any longer. She pushed the dish towards Sima Hui. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to have kept this sugarcane for so long. Sister Hui, you should have it instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui smiled gently, \u201cI don\u2019t like to eat sweet things. Lian\u2019er, go ahead and eat it. The only reason I even have these is because Su City had an abundant harvest of sugarcane. I bought them while passing by with my subordinates. If you feel bad, then you can make some salty snacks for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian did have a sweet tooth, as could be seen from how she always drank honey water without any hint of getting tired of it.</p><br/><p>Since Sima Hui had already explained her reasons, it would be impolite for Chu Lian to refuse the sugarcane. Her lips curled up into a smile, \u201cSince Sister Hui has already offered it to me, I won\u2019t stand on ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian used the toothpicks placed next to the dish to pick up a piece and put it in her mouth. The sugarcane had been kept well and it was still very juicy. She chewed it forcefully, bringing out the sweet juice within and filling her mouth with the unique taste of the sugarcane. This taste was completely different from eating candied kumquats.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly crunched her way through five pieces. Although her actions weren\u2019t as elegant as those of noble-born ladies, the way she ate made anyone watching her hungry too! When Sima Hui saw how happily she was eating, she picked up a piece of sugarcane and ate it as well, even though she normally didn\u2019t like sweet things.</p><br/><p>Thus, the scene that greeted He Changdi when he entered the tent was his dear wife sitting at the table and happily gnawing away at sugarcane!</p><br/><p>Of course, the scene wasn\u2019t complete without Sima Hui staring at Chu Lian with a warm and gentle gaze.</p><br/><p>There was a small plate on the table where Chu Lian had spat out the remains of the sugarcane after chewing on them. The amount of sugarcane mush there was like a thorn in He Changdi\u2019s eye.</p><br/><p>Now the bag of sugarcane he was carrying on his back had become hard to give away.</p><br/><p>When Laiyue followed his young master into the tent and was met with the same scene, he was filled with regret.</p><br/><p>Why was Third Young Madam having sugarcane here in General Sima\u2019s tent? If only he had brought back some fruits instead! Why did he have to bring back sugarcane?</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had come in rather abruptly. He had charged right in without waiting for the guard outside. It was then that the female guard came in to report her lapse while trembling. Sima Hui waved her hand and sent the guard back out without any punishment.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s cheeks were slightly puffed up since she hadn\u2019t finished chewing on the piece of sugarcane in her mouth.</p><br/><p>She blinked and stared as she spoke. The food in her mouth made her words muffled, \u201cHe Jangdi, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang turned around and threw the bag in his hands to Laiyue before turning back to Chu Lian. He replied her in a cool tone, \u201cWhat? Can\u2019t I come over to take a look at my wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian frowned and spat out the sugarcane bits in her mouth. She was extremely vexed. What was wrong with her lunatic husband now?</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s eyes shifted towards the table not too far away from him. He noticed that there were a few types of fine-looking confections displayed there and realised that he hadn\u2019t eaten any of them before. He didn\u2019t even have to think to know that those had definitely been made by Chu Lian or one of her maidservants. Even he hadn\u2019t tried any of those before as her husband. However, she had brought them out now to suck up to Sima Hui!</p><br/><p>As the anger within him grew, his expression grew even more frosty. He suppressed the frustration in his heart and said, \u201cSince you\u2019re clearly eating and drinking well, I\u2019ll take my leave now!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang left as hurriedly as he had come. Before Chu Lian could even say a word, he had already swept the tent flap up and left the tent\u2026</p><br/><p>The short exchange between the couple left Sima Hui gaping in shock. The corner of her lip tugged downwards in sympathy as she turned to Chu Lian, \u201cLian\u2019er, um, do you have to chase after him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian rolled her eyes. What should she chase him for? Had Sima Hui gotten their roles in reverse somehow? Why did she, as a woman, have to chase out after her unreasonable husband?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to. He\u2019s always been like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue was still in the tent. When he heard his young madam\u2019s reply, the corner of his mouth twitched. He didn\u2019t want to see his master\u2019s efforts go to waste, so he purposely let one side of the bag slip, revealing the sugarcane within. He turned to Third Young Madam with a troubled expression and started saying, \u201cThird Young Madam, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wasn\u2019t blind. Laiyue had been too obvious in his actions, so she had definitely seen what was inside the bag. Her lips tugged downwards and she seemed a little helpless, \u201cJust make your own way back first. I\u2019ll visit him later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting Chu Lian\u2019s promise, Laiyue let out a silly and bright smile. He bowed respectfully to her before turning and leaving.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

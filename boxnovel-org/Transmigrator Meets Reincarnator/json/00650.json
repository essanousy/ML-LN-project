Over the past couple of days, she ate very lightly for all her meals.</p><br/><p>Wenlan asked worriedly, \u201cThird Young Madam, do you have anything that you want to eat for lunch? This servant will go prepare it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Young Madam usually placed a lot of importance with regards to food, but she just waved her hand in disinterest now, \u201cJust prepare a few simple dishes. I ate very little this morning, so prepare for lunch earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenlan didn\u2019t understand Chu Lian\u2019s meaning and thought that Third Young Madam\u2019s appetite had recovered. With a happy expression on her face, she took two maidservants with her to pick out the ingredients.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian really did have lunch a lot earlier this afternoon.</p><br/><p>She ate about two hours earlier than usual.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t eat as much as Wenlan had expected. Chu Lian only drank half a bowl of the fragrant old duck stew before saying she was full.</p><br/><p>After that, she went behind the screen to take an afternoon nap.</p><br/><p>When He Changdi returned at noon, Chu Lian had just gone to sleep an hour ago.</p><br/><p>When he entered the tent and noticed that it was completely quiet, his expression became even more stern and cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour young madam hasn\u2019t eaten yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing replied with her head bowed, \u201cReplying to Third Young Master, Third Young Madam ate two hours ago. She\u2019s taking a nap right now.\u201d Though Wenqing\u2019s words sounded respectful, they lacked some emotion.</p><br/><p>He Changdi could sense the changes within the entire tent.</p><br/><p>He had been intending to mention having lunch with Chu Lian, but he decided to give up on the idea in the end.</p><br/><p>He waved his hand at Wenqing, \u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing left the tent without even looking back.</p><br/><p>Laiyue was waiting outside and went up to Wenqing when he saw her come out.</p><br/><p>Laiyue\u2019s face was full of anxiety, \u201cMy dear sister Wenqing, how\u2019s the situation inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue pulled Wenqing to the side and whispered, \u201cDidn\u2019t you notice that Third Young Madam is quarreling with Third Young Master?! What do you think happened? They were fine earlier, but everything suddenly changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing was already angry at He Changdi, so her anger was instantly ignited when the tactless Laiyue began making false assumptions. It seemed like the saying that servants will act the same as their masters was true. This Laiyue wasn\u2019t a good person either.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen your damned eyes and have a good look! Is it Third Young Madam\u2019s fault? Or Third Young Master\u2019s fault? If you don\u2019t know the answer, then you\u2019re also not allowed to eat, just like your Third Young Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue widened his eyes in shock and pulled on Wenqing\u2019s sleeve, \u201cAhhh, my dear ancestor. Please, I\u2019m seriously begging you. Please give me a bowl of food. I\u2019ve been running around for the whole morning and I haven\u2019t even had a sip of water!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing sneered, \u201cWhat? The snacks over at Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s place wasn\u2019t enough to fill your stomach? Stop pretending to be so pitiful in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue felt pity for himself inwardly, \u201cSister Wenqing, please don\u2019t misunderstand me. I went out for an errand early this morning. I never went to Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing was stunned, \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s tent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue shook his head and his face was scrunched up like an orange.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo only Third Young Master went?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. That\u2019s not something I would dare ask Third Young Master about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing gave him a fierce glare, \u201cYou\u2019re so useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAy, No. Sister, I\u2019m really innocent. Please spare me some food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue really did look quite pitiful.</p><br/><p>There were stains all over his green robe and stubble had grown on his chin. His hair was also in a mess. Just by looking at his appearance, he really looked like a random refugee.</p><br/><p>Wenqing harrumphed, \u201cCome with me. Third Young Madam has some leftovers from lunch. You got lucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue smiled, flashing a mouth full of white teeth, \u201cAlright. It\u2019s fine as long as there\u2019s something to eat. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hungry He Changdi, who wasn\u2019t even in the mood to eat, would never have thought that his personal manservant had already abandoned him.</p><br/><p>Each household was to take care of their own food and needs on the hunting grounds as the imperial family wouldn\u2019t care about their survival. Even if He Changdi was on duty every day, he still needed to have his meals in his own tent.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had purposely eaten earlier to avoid having to sit at the same table as He Changdi.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t expect Wenqing and Wenlan to be even more harsh. They hadn\u2019t even prepared any food for He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Regardless, He Changdi didn\u2019t have any appetite right now. His head and heart were in a complete daze. He tiptoed around the screen to check on Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was laying on her side with her back facing him. Her soft little body was curled up into a ball. He reached out, about to touch her, but he retracted his hand halfway through.</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes, then walked around the screen and laid down on the chaise beside it for a while.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian opened her eyes once he left.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at the ceiling and blinked furiously. She hadn\u2019t actually fallen asleep just now. After a long moment, she smiled at herself mockingly. It seemed like it would be impossible to get an explanation from He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Forget it. If he didn\u2019t want to speak, then so be it.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian angrily turned over, closed her eyes, and fell asleep for real.</p><br/><p>He Changdi wasn\u2019t in the tent anymore when she woke up.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the emperor took his men to the forest in the mountain to hunt. Royal Princess Duanjia sent someone to bring over some wild meat, including wild duck, pheasant, and a deer. There was supposed to be a bonfire banquet tonight, but Chu Lian used her ill health as an excuse to decline attendance.</p><br/><p>However, Chu Lian felt bad for not doing anything at all when facing the game that had been sent over.</p><br/><p>Wenqing brought a rocking chair over for her. She sat on the chair and directed the maidservants on how to roast the game.</p><br/><p>After they finished preparing the wild meats, Chu Lian didn\u2019t even take a bite. She ordered people to send them to Old Duke Zheng, Royal Princess Duanjia, Prince Jin, and the others.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

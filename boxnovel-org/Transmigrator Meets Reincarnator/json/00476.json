She whispered, \u201cSister Xiyan, you don\u2019t have to worry so much. Third Young Master usually dotes on Third Young Madam, why would he bully her? As servants, we shouldn\u2019t interfere with our masters\u2019 business. Moreover, Third Young Madam didn\u2019t call for us. We can\u2019t just go in like that. Also, think about Third Young Madam\u2019s personality. If she was really being bullied, wouldn\u2019t she call for help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xiyan was still worried, Wenqing ultimately convinced her.</p><br/><p>After their masters had returned to Songtao Court, they were able to see for themselves how much Third Young Master cared for Third Young Madam. Also, Third Young Madam was someone who would definitely return an eye for an eye. If she really suffered any grievance, she wouldn\u2019t endure it silently.</p><br/><p>The two personal maidservants stayed up until midnight. Xiyan finally breathed a sigh of relief when they could no longer hear any movement within the room.</p><br/><p>Wenqing finally relaxed as well, her face flushed.</p><br/><p>Since their masters had settled down for the night, they didn\u2019t need two servants to stay up for the night shift. In the end, Wenqing told Xiyan to take a rest and leave her to keep watch through the night in the side room by herself.</p><br/><p>After leaving the room, Xiyan didn\u2019t immediately go back to her room to rest. She headed to Senior Servant Gui\u2019s room first to report that the young couple had finally consummated their marriage.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui was still awake, waiting for Xiyan\u2019s report.</p><br/><p>After receiving the news, Senior Servant Gui clasped her hands together and bowed in prayer. A smile appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>She pushed Xiyan and said, \u201cWell, I can rest assured now. If Third Young Madam gives birth to a son in the future, I\u2019ll be able to enjoy my old age in peace. It\u2019s getting late now. You should hurry and go sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan watched as Senior Servant Gui got up from bed instead and started getting dressed. She asked curiously, \u201cMomo, why are you getting up when it\u2019s already this late?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui grinned so widely that her eyes disappeared, \u201cSixth Miss has a thin and weak body. This first night must have been tough for her. I\u2019m going to brew some nourishing soup, so she can drink some first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how excited Senior Servant Gui was, Xiyan didn\u2019t stop her, \u201cMomo, do rest earlier when you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll go back to my room first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan and Fuyan lived in the same room.</p><br/><p>When Xiyan returned to her room, she saw that the room was still lit. Her brows creased into a frown and she muttered to herself, \u201cIt\u2019s already so late, why hasn\u2019t Fuyan slept yet? What\u2019s that girl doing at this hour!\u201d</p><br/><p>She quickly walked towards the door and tried pushing it open, only to find out that someone had actually locked it from the inside.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s personal maidservants all lived together in a small courtyard within Songtao Court. They usually took turns to be on standby with their masters at night, so the courtyard entrance and the room doors were never locked.</p><br/><p>There was also a senior servant guarding the courtyard entrance at night. It was even more strictly guarded outside, so nothing had ever happened before.</p><br/><p>A trace of suspicion was aroused in Xiyan\u2019s heart. She called out softly to Fuyan from outside the door.</p><br/><p>Fuyan suffered a fright when she heard the door being pushed. She had been expecting Xiyan to be on duty until morning since she was taking the night shift. Who could have thought that Xiyan would return to their room at this time?</p><br/><p>She panicked and hid the letter she had been clutching in her hands under her pillow. She straightened out her dress and calmed her breathing before opening the door as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>When the door opened from the inside, Xiyan immediately entered the room, only to see that Fuyan haven\u2019t even changed her clothes. It was obvious that she hasn\u2019t slept yet, so she asked, \u201cIt\u2019s so late, why aren\u2019t you resting? It\u2019s your turn to serve Third Young Madam tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuyan went over to the bed and sat down. She picked up the sewing basket next to her and said, \u201cI wanted to finish sewing the flower on this handkerchief before going to sleep. I didn\u2019t realise that time flew by so quickly. So it\u2019s already midnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan furrowed her brows, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to stay up so late. You can work on the handkerchief anytime. Alright, go to sleep now. If something goes wrong tomorrow, momo won\u2019t spare you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I\u2019ll listen to Sister Xiyan. I\u2019ll pack my things up and sleep now. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

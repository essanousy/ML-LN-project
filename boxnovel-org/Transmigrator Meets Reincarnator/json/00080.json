Furthermore, these noble personages hadn\u2019t appeared in that event. Why did these princesses have their eyes on her now?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian felt a headache brewing. She couldn\u2019t even tell which princess was which\u2026</p><br/><p>Since she didn\u2019t know their identities or their family backgrounds, she could only bow in greeting towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Yuanqin, is that the woman that Brother He abandoned?\u201d</p><br/><p>The slightly older girl standing at the back chuckled in a haughty manner. She was the legitimate Fifth Miss from House Dingyuan, Zou Yuanqin. She had just come of age and was one of Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s study companions. The sudden exclamation that Chu Lian had heard earlier had come from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial Princess, your eyes are really sharp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao was wearing an outfit of about the same colour as Chu Lian\u2019s today. She was even wearing a ruby hair ornament.</p><br/><p>However, the workmanship on her dress was much more exquisite, while the materials were clearly rare. The pink dress had a slight gradient from top to bottom. Beautiful patterns were embroidered onto the skirt, and there were even small pieces of precious stones woven into the material. When the light hit them, the dress sparkled like a starry sky. It was both elegant and luxurious.</p><br/><p>In comparison, Chu Lian\u2019s similar outfit looked much poorer.</p><br/><p>However, with Chu Lian\u2019s delicate looks, slender body, and lovely figure, she still managed to look stunning in the simple pink dress that she was wearing, especially since she was currently in the best period of her youth. Conversely, the eleven-year-old Imperial Princess Leyao still hadn\u2019t quite grown into her figure.</p><br/><p>When the two of them stood opposite each other, they each had a charm of their own. However, when looking closely at their outfits, Chu Lian\u2019s dress wasn\u2019t quite up to par. The ruby butterfly pin on her head had been bright and lovely at first, but compared to Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s ornament, it completely lost its colour.</p><br/><p>The buzzing of discussion sprang up around them, and Chu Lian could feel the contempt in the gazes thrown at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow shabby!\u201d Imperial Princess Leyao smirked as she said.</p><br/><p>With that one comment from the princess, the noise of discussion grew ever louder. All the voices she had been trying to ignore fell into her ears one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, didn\u2019t House Jing\u2019an connect with House Ying because of their particularly\u2026 fertile ladies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear? He Sanlang left his family and the capital just two days ago!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what a joke. Without her man, what use is her fertility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? She\u2019s just a poor little maid. I can\u2019t believe she wore that to the Dingyuan Estate. How embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you all don\u2019t know yet. This Sixth Miss Chu didn\u2019t have a good reputation in the first place. I\u2019m afraid that it was He Sanlang who must have been forced to leave because he didn\u2019t like this new wife of his!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>House Ying\u2019s Madam Rong had taken a trip to the restroom and had just come back. When she noticed the clamour in Mei Court, she looked over in curiosity. It was at this moment that Miss Su, from the main branch, came over to hold Madam Rong\u2019s arm. With a pale face, she said, \u201cEldest Sister-in-law, Sixth Sister is being bullied.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second branch\u2019s Eighth Miss, Miss Yuan, also followed along. She rolled her eyes in scorn. \u201cShe\u2019s been abandoned by her husband just days after her marriage. I can\u2019t believe she still dares to come out just to lose face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Rong\u2019s expression instantly changed. She glared at Miss Yuan first, and then asked Miss Su, \u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, House Jing\u2019an had hidden the news that He Changdi had left for the northern border. However, the news had been leaked somehow.</p><br/><p>Madam Rong, who usually spent her time in the inner court, didn\u2019t know much of outside news. After hearing Miss Su\u2019s explanation, her face turned solemn.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that Imperial Princess Leyao, Royal Princess Duanjia, and Feudal Princess Anmin are all here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Judging from Imperial Princess Leyao\u2019s words, it seems like she doesn\u2019t really like Sixth Sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan stomped her foot fiercely. \u201cThat troublemaker! When did she anger the princess?! Now we\u2019re going to be pulled into trouble along with her. We shouldn\u2019t have let her marry into House Jing\u2019an back then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Yuan, stop speaking nonsense!\u201d Madam Rong scolded her in a low tone.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the Ying Estate, so Madam Rong couldn\u2019t let them speak so freely. Even though Chu Lian wasn\u2019t favoured in House Ying, since she had married, anything she did would still reflect back on House Ying. Since she was here, she couldn\u2019t just ignore the situation that Chu Lian was in.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wanted to scold He Changdi until his eardrums bled right now. \u2018Brother He\u2019? When did that fellow seduce this princess!? Furthermore, this princess was still pretty young. Wasn\u2019t she a little too mature for her age?!</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia was standing next to Imperial Princess Leyao. She was more than a head taller than Princess Leyao, and had a cold expression on. However, her gaze was fixed on Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>From not far away, Wei Fengzi had also noticed the situation outside the corridor. The corner of her lip lifted when she saw Chu Lian standing in the middle of the crowd. Since Chu Lian hadn\u2019t sent any of her maidservants to ask for help, she simply sat back and watched the commotion.</p><br/><p>Feudal Princess Anmin cast a look of disdain towards Chu Lian. \u201cSince we\u2019ve already seen her, Leyao, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Feudal Princess Anmin\u2019s words, several young ladies of high status turned around to leave at the same time. House Dingyuan\u2019s Fifth Miss, Zou Yuanqin, shot a parting glance at Chu Lian. Unexpectedly, there wasn\u2019t any restrained anger or pain in Chu Lian\u2019s expression. Zou Yuanqin\u2019s face contorted and her glance grew contemptuous. Only then did she follow the rest of the noble ladies.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mouth twitched as she watched the noble ladies\u2019 figures disappear into the distance. Huh? So all they had come to do was ridicule her? Wasn\u2019t that a little too childish?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It felt as if his heated body had cooled instantly. He subconsciously hugged the warm and soft woman in his arms more tightly, as that seemed to be the only way he could feel reassured.</p><br/><p>Urihan and her sons were fine. After eating some food and resting for the whole night in a warm pen, their spirits were better than ever.</p><br/><p>By the time Chu Lian woke up again, she realised that it was already the afternoon of the next day.</p><br/><p>She curled up a little and rubbed at her sleepy eyes. The natural furnace that had been keeping her warm was already gone. Her body shook a little to warm up from the cold and she quickly became alert.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to sit up and call for someone, the curtain that worked as a door for the warm pen shifted. He Changdi used only one arm to push himself into the warm pen.</p><br/><p>He set an indigo coloured little package to one side. When he looked up and accidentally met her gaze, he immediately looked away.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed that his expression seemed a little weird and the tips of his ears were slightly red. Her brows drew together in confusion and she looked downwards at herself. It was then that all was made clear and her own face started flushing red.</p><br/><p>The inner clothes she had been wearing had loosened in her sleep. Since the tie holding the two sides of her top closed had been broken by someone, her clothes were wide open, showing the light yellow halter top she wore inside. However, the halter top had also shifted in her sleep and was now exposing a great amount of her fair skin. There were obvious red marks all over the skin on her chest, the remaining evidence of He Sanlang\u2019s \u2018indulgence\u2019 last night.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glared at him and quickly pulled her top closed. She barked at him angrily, \u201cTurn around!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, He Sanlang was strangely obedient. He turned around without any retort. Once Chu Lian was sure that he couldn\u2019t see her, she quickly adjusted her own clothes.</p><br/><p>However, when she found out that the tie keeping her top closed had been broken, she could no longer suppress her upset emotions, \u201cHe Changdi, this is all your fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had already forgotten about that small detail. When his wife started shouting at him out of the blue, he felt rather aggrieved.</p><br/><p>He pressed his lips together, but he still kept his back to her like she had ordered.q</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I turn back now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn back here!\u201d Chu Lian fumed.</p><br/><p>When He Changdi turned around and looked at Chu Lian, he finally understood what she was angry about.</p><br/><p>A furious blush flared to life on his cheeks as he recalled how exactly he had broken that cloth tie last night. His right hand twitched in rememberance as well. Even the cool He Sanlang couldn\u2019t quite summon up the courage to speak in the face of his wife\u2019s admonishment at this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any clothes? Get me some.\u201d</p><br/><p>She could only make do by holding her inner clothes closed for now. The fox fur cloak she had been wearing yesterday was now completely covered in horse blood and was stinking to high heaven. She couldn\u2019t put that on her any more.</p><br/><p>He Changdi coughed awkwardly and reached out towards a small cabinet built into the wall of the warm pen. He dug around in it and found a set of clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any female clothing here, you have to make do with mine first.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the snowboat that He Changdi had taken to Su City, so there were a few sets of his clothes in here.</p><br/><p>Since they were still stuck in the vast snowy plains, Chu Lian had no choice but to wear He Sanlang\u2019s clothes for now.</p><br/><p>He had given her a thick black long robe with green bamboo patterns embroidered on it. It seemed like any other piece of clothing at first, but once she pulled it on, she immediately felt the difference between her and Sanlang.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s figure was tall and lanky. After training for almost half a year in the north, his body had become much more sturdy as compared to before.</p><br/><p>Conversely, Chu Lian\u2019s figure was small and slim. When the two of them stood together, she only reached his chest. Now that she had He Sanlang\u2019s robe on her, she looked as if she was wearing some long-sleeved stage costume\u2026</p><br/><p>After she finished doing up the round little buttons on the top, the robe still felt loose around her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sighed. She really didn\u2019t have any other options. She couldn\u2019t just keep wearing a single layer of inner clothing with the tie broken. Even if she didn\u2019t have to meet anyone in that state, she would surely freeze to death.</p><br/><p>She climbed up from her nest of blankets and dug out her waist band before using it to tie up the huge robe around her.</p><br/><p>Following that, she rolled up the sleeves high so she could finally see her hands. Once she was done with all that, Chu Lian heaved a sigh of relief. Now she could sit down in peace.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was watching her with his slightly slanted eyes the whole time.</p><br/><p>Actually, the robe was made to be worn by itself and he usually didn\u2019t need a waist band to tie it up. However, in order to hold the loose robe down, Chu Lian had to use the waistband from her inner clothes to tie it down. Unexpectedly, once the robe was secured, it only emphasised the curves on Chu Lian\u2019s chest. His mind drifted back to the sensation on his hands last night without his bidding.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Chu Lian was wearing his clothes right now. Any man would feel a sense of domination and satisfaction upon seeing the woman he liked in his clothes.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know that her simple actions had somehow managed to satisfy a hidden desire of Sanlang\u2019s. She sat down and turned her gaze to the package that He Sanlang had brought with him.</p><br/><p>She gulped once. Her stomach started rumbling loudly just in time.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was pulled back to the present by the sound. However, he didn\u2019t seem disagreeable at all. Instead, he seemed to understand what she wanted.</p><br/><p>He passed over the cloth bag in his hands to Chu Lian, \u201cEat something first to fill your belly. We\u2019ll reach the main camp by evening.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

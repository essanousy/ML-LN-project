When the guard came rushing over in a panic shouting his report, the thunder on his face could scare even the boldest of tigers.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue shot the reporting guard a look. Luckily, the guard seemed to have some wits about him and quickly suppressed his emotions. He came over to He Changdi\u2019s side and reported more quietly, \u201cThird Young Master, Miss\u2026 Miss Miaozhen\u2019s child might not make it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, the guard lowered his head, unable to face Third Young Master\u2019s stormy gaze.</p><br/><p>The air around He Changdi turned frosty. \u201cWhat does that have to do with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard\u2019s legs were shaking from having to bear the force of Third Young Master\u2019s temper. He trembled and stuttered, but finally, under the pressure of He Changdi\u2019s icy aura, he spat out the truth in one go. \u201cThe\u2026 the doctor said that, M-Miss Miaozhen\u2019s miscarriage was caused\u2026 by eating the candied hawthorns that Third Young Madam sent over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Candied hawthorns?</p><br/><p>A cold light filled He Changdi\u2019s fathomless eyes. He kept his gaze on the quaking guard before him, his every word emanating a violent chill as he said, \u201cWho sent for the doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard didn\u2019t dare to hide anything when Third Young Master was in this state. \u201cIt was the heir\u2026 The heir personally sent for the old doctor in Chongde Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve received your report. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d Not a single emotion could be heard from He Changdi\u2019s magnetic voice.</p><br/><p>The guard, who had fallen to his knees in fear, managed to gather enough courage to look up at Third Young Master and then at the carriage that hadn\u2019t even moved. However, in the end, it wasn\u2019t enough to make him spit out the rest of the report.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe that the good-natured Third Young Madam would do such a thing, but from the doctor\u2019s testimony and the clear benefits involved, he had no choice but to think that the culprit was indeed Third Young Madam.</p><br/><p>When he thought of Third Young Madam\u2019s lovely visage and how there was a poisonous heart hiding underneath, he couldn\u2019t help but tremble.</p><br/><p>The main branch of the Jing\u2019an Estate had no heirs. Miaozhen had invited a doctor specialising in gynecology to make a diagnosis a few months after getting pregnant. The doctor had mentioned that there was an eighty percent chance of the child being a boy. Although there hadn\u2019t been any official announcements made, the whole estate knew that both Countess Jing\u2019an and Matriarch He had great expectations for the child in Miaozhen\u2019s belly.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an had even kept Miaozhen by her side to keep an eye on things, afraid that there would be some unfortunate accident. Who could have thought that problems would arise when Miaozhen was this far along!</p><br/><p>Now that the possibility of a male heir for the main branch was gone, if Third Young Madam were to fall pregnant, she would give birth to the very first little young master of House Jing\u2019an.</p><br/><p>What a scheme!</p><br/><p>Laiyue knew that Third Young Madam had made candied hawthorns for Countess Jing\u2019an yesterday, so he hurriedly explained, \u201cThird Young Master, it definitely wasn\u2019t Third Young Madam. There must be some explanation for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi turned to look at the anxious Laiyue, but he didn\u2019t say anything besides instructing the party to hurry back to the estate.</p><br/><p>Laiyue couldn\u2019t tell what was going on in his master\u2019s mind. However, he knew that Third Young Madam and Third Young Master seemed to have quarrelled earlier. Now that this matter had suddenly arisen, his master wouldn\u2019t really think that this had anything to do with Third Young Madam, right?</p><br/><p>News spread fast. In just a short moment, even Xiyan, who was sitting in the carriage behind them, knew of the matter.</p><br/><p>Her face immediately turned ashen. She remembered what Chu Lian had said to Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia when they had been eating the so-called \u2018hawthorn balls\u2019 and clenched her fists as her thoughts raced. Who was trying to pin the blame on their Third Young Madam?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

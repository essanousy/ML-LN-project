Although the lighting was dim, she could see his features clearly.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang didn\u2019t look as handsome as his usual self. Right now, he looked more like a normal man worried about his wife.</p><br/><p>His face had an unhealthy pallor to it and he was starting to look like a panda. Even stubble had started growing on his chin. However, he didn\u2019t look disheveled or unkempt. Instead, those marks of fatigue gave him the charisma of a mature man.</p><br/><p>She had to mention it again; He Sanlang\u2019s looks were really top-notch. Although his brilliant and heroic features weren\u2019t as popular as Xiao Bojian\u2019s in this era, He Changdi was the better-looking out of the two in Chu Lian\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>As Chu Lian looked up at him with her wide eyes, the back of He Sanlang\u2019s ears were slowly turning red and his expression was becoming a little stiff.</p><br/><p>His icy tone resounded in the small space as he spoke, a hint of awkwardness present in his voice, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian replied without thinking, \u201cLooking at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi hadn\u2019t expected such a frank statement from her. A blush immediately spread down his neck in reaction.</p><br/><p>He turned his face away stiffly as his eyes darted to and fro until they finally landed on the roof of the pen.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian glanced at him and noticed that his entire neck was now red, she stared in stunned surprise. He\u2026 He Changdi was actually embarrassed\u2026 Had he always been so sensitive?</p><br/><p>He Sanlang resisted the urge to squirm under Chu Lian\u2019s probing gaze and reacted by covering up her inquisitive eyes with his hand. His voice was slightly husky as he said, \u201cStop looking, there\u2019s nothing to see here. Go to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Considering what she had woken up to, Chu Lian didn\u2019t dare to actually fall asleep again!</p><br/><p>Who knew what her lunatic husband was going to do if she fell asleep this time\u2026</p><br/><p>Even though Chu Lian hadn\u2019t brought up the topic, it didn\u2019t mean that she had really forgotten about what had just happened. She just felt that it was too awkward and she wasn\u2019t brave enough to mention it. One side of her chest was still throbbing a little in pain!</p><br/><p>That damned He Sanlang!</p><br/><p>She tried her best to hold back her question, but she ended up asking anyway. \u201cAre you going to be here as well? I\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hint in her words was that she was already perfectly well and he should move along with his own business. His presence would be disturbing her rest.</p><br/><p>He Changdi still had some smarts left in that head of his. He instantly understood the meaning behind Chu Lian\u2019s words. His expression turned slightly stormy; any husband who had just been disdained by his wife would probably react the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough warm pens and we have too many people in our party. Some of the other pens are packed with up to five people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian bit her lip. She had no choice here, He Changdi had actually managed to corner her with his words.</p><br/><p>He had a point. If she really threw him out at this time, wouldn\u2019t his brothers laugh at him?</p><br/><p>It would be hard to explain why he wanted to squeeze in with the other guys instead of staying with his wife.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian lamented her misfortune inwardly and gave up. They were married anyway and she didn\u2019t actually dislike He Sanlang. On the contrary, she might even have taken a liking to him somewhere deep in her heart.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t really anything in the way of them becoming husband and wife in truth, rather than just in name.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian showed him a faint frown, \u201cThen you had better behave yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s expression had somewhat relaxed after Chu Lian hadn\u2019t taken him to task for his misdeeds. The moment she brought up the elephant in the room, his handsome face lit up in a spectacular blush once again.</p><br/><p>He gulped hard. Even his fingers felt rather stiff from all the tension in him.</p><br/><p>It was only after a long pause that he finally managed to give a response, \u201cSleep, I won\u2019t move at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shot a doubtful glance at him before grunting lightly in agreement. From the way she wrapped her clothes tightly around herself, it was clear that she didn\u2019t trust in He Changdi\u2019s weak self-control.</p><br/><p>She was about to shut her eyes when she abruptly remembered Urihan and her sons.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the people who were lying in the horses with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang shifted the cloaks and fleeces covering the two of them and made sure that Chu Lian\u2019s entire body was properly shielded from the cold, \u201cThey\u2019re in another warm pen. Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a doctor looking after them. They\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that her companions were safe, Chu Lian sighed in relief and finally let herself relax fully.</p><br/><p>She looked up at He Changdi. He seemed to have recovered from his blush and was now back to the normal calm and cool-headed Sanlang. However, when she looked closer at his narrow, upturned eyes, she could still detect a well-hidden trace of tenderness in their depths.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian blinked, \u201cHe Sanlang, did you find out who did all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question made He Sanlang\u2019s sharp brows lift a little. He didn\u2019t like how Chu Lian had addressed him.</p><br/><p>After a slight pause, he cast a searching gaze downwards at the woman curled up between his arms, as if trying to see through her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The space between Chu Lian\u2019s brows wrinkled as she thought seriously. Her face was like an open book. All of her thoughts and emotions could be read just by looking at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose kidnappers couldn\u2019t possibly have been sent by Xiao Bojian, right?\u201d Chu Lian\u2019s words sent a ripple of shock through He Changdi.</p><br/><p>His pupils constricted; he met Chu Lian\u2019s innocent gaze with a grave expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you think so?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

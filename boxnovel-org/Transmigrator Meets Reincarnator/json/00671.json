As they passed the first wall behind the entrance, then the outer court and finally, to the inner court, there were maidservants peeking at them the whole way.</p><br/><p>Once they entered the main courtyard within the inner court, Manager Qin took Myeryen straight to Chu Lian, who was sitting under some grape vines.</p><br/><p>Today, it was Xiyan and Wenlan who were on duty.</p><br/><p>The child in Chu Lian\u2019s child had just passed three months. Great Doctor Miao had declared that the pregnancy was stable now, making everyone around He Changdi and Chu Lian relax.</p><br/><p>It was now more than a month since Chu Lian had discovered her pregnancy.</p><br/><p>She had been trapped in the estate for this whole month. He Changdi was normally very busy, but he somehow managed to free up enough time and spent two or three days with her in the estate for every ten days.</p><br/><p>If it were only Senior Servants Gui and Zhong by her side, they might not have dared to interfere with her actions, but it was a different story when it came to He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Thinking back to the month or so that she had been cooped up inside the estate, a furrow developed between Chu Lian\u2019s brows. Unless it was absolutely necessary, He Changdi had actually forbidden her from leaving her room.</p><br/><p>However, she did care very much for the little bun growing in her belly too, so even without any servants by her side to remind her, she would take special care in moving around.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, Great Doctor Miao had personally declared that she could leave her room. So today, she had come out to enjoy some fresh air under the hanging grape vines.</p><br/><p>On this hot day, it was already painful enough that she couldn\u2019t drink anything cold, but she still had to place a light blanket over her tummy.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shifted the thin blanket aside in disdain, but the sharp-eyed Xiyan quickly pulled it back in place.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had no choice but to take up the lotus seed porridge at the side and sip some to alleviate the heat she was feeling.</p><br/><p>From far away, they could see Manager Qin bringing a few people over.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian noticed the foreign-looking man behind Manager Qin, who was at least half a head taller than the poor manager, the corners of her mouth curled up.</p><br/><p>She had to say that Myeryen was rather handsome after he had grown up. He looked like one of those European models from the modern times now. After training with Manager Qin for a few months, he had lost the cowardly and weak demeanour he had when they had first met, and had become more confident.</p><br/><p>Now that his health had recovered, Myeryen was more self-assured. Furthermore, after helping Chu Lian manage the northern market, he had gotten better at speaking.</p><br/><p>He saw Chu Lian lying against the wooden chair first, and his expression lit up. Following that, he spotted Wenlan, who was sitting beside Chu Lian and working on some embroidery.</p><br/><p>This time, his brown eyes sparkled even more, as if he had just seen something precious to him.</p><br/><p>As the men walked closer to them, Chu Lian was observing them. Of course, she noticed Myeryen\u2019s expression and made a mental note of it. Her eyes slid sideways to cast a nonchalant gaze over Wenlan, who had her head bowed as she focused on her embroidery. A smirk danced on Chu Lian\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin had come here with Myeryen to report on the progress of the northern market, as well as hand over the account books for the season.</p><br/><p>Knowing that Chu Lian was pregnant now and that she couldn\u2019t overexert herself, Manager Qin only stayed for a while before leaving.</p><br/><p>Just as Manager Qin was leaving, they bumped into He Changdi, who was returning to the estate. He Changdi quickly noticed Myeryen standing behind Manager Qin.</p><br/><p>Myeryen came over to greet He Changdi rather enthusiastically, perhaps since they hadn\u2019t met for some time. He made a proper salute towards He Changdi, as befitting a citizen of the Great Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother He!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi was a little surprised. He hadn\u2019t managed to recognise that this tall and skinny foreign boy was Myeryen.</p><br/><p>The Myeryen of today was utterly different from the Myeryen of his past lifetime.</p><br/><p>In his past life, Myeryen had been so thin that he had been practically skin and bones. He had also been dreadfully ill. He had never seen Myeryen look so lively before.</p><br/><p>\u201cMyeryen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Myeryen grinned and rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother He, I didn\u2019t think that you would be able to recognise me. Even Ah-ma said that I\u2019ve changed too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s gaze was slightly warmer than usual as he patted Myeryen\u2019s shoulder, \u201cHow are Ah-ma and your brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Myeryen smiled, revealing a mouth full of white teeth, \u201cAh-ma is doing very well! My brother and I are both working under Manager Qin and learning.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi glanced in the direction the two of them had come from, \u201cDid you go to see Madam just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin was the one who replied, \u201cReplying to my lord, I just handed over the account books for the northern market to Madam, together with Myeryen.\u201d</p><br/><p>When He Changdi had left the Jing\u2019an Estate, he had brought out all the servants from Songtao Court. Since Matriarch He was still around, their rank in their family was still the same, so the servants hadn\u2019t changed the way they addressed their masters in the Anyuan Estate. They still called the couple Third Young Madam and Third Young Master.</p><br/><p>However, now that there was a child in Chu Lian\u2019s belly, they couldn\u2019t continue the old way of addressing their masters, since their masters had upgraded by one generation. If Chu Lian gave birth to a boy, he would become the little Heir Anyuan, and He Changdi and Chu Lian would then have to be called Master and Madam.</p><br/><p>He Changdi turned to Myeryen and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and visit Ah-ma some other time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then let Manager Qin and Myeryen leave.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

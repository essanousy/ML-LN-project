He Changqi had suddenly become the only master in the entire estate who was entirely healthy and normal.</p><br/><p>He Changqi was actually mired in his own worries and he was in no mood to celebrate the New Year. Each day, he would leave early in the morning to search for any news of the situation in the north, only returning late at night. He even used his connections to send a request to Princess Wei.</p><br/><p>Early this morning, the silent and subdued entrance of the Jing\u2019an Estate suddenly turned lively again.</p><br/><p>A few carriages marked with the flags of the Jing\u2019an Estate stopped in front of the estate\u2019s gates.</p><br/><p>Following that, a green-clad maidservant jumped out from the lead carriage before quickly setting out a wooden stool by the carriage. She lifted up the curtain covering the carriage entrance and carefully helped the person within the carriage out.</p><br/><p>The first to emerge from the confines of the carriage was a young lady wearing a dark green hood. She looked to be about fifteen or sixteen years old. Her figure was slender and she was dressed in a plain-coloured vest over a reddish brown dress. Closely following behind her was a middle-aged woman.</p><br/><p>The woman was slightly plump and was wrapped in a brocade cloak. Her hair was combed up into a conch shape, with only a simple silver hairpin to decorate her black hair.</p><br/><p>She turned her head slightly and patted the young lady\u2019s hand, as if reassuring her.</p><br/><p>Her face actually held some resemblance to House Jing\u2019an\u2019s matriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cNianzhen, this is your grandmother\u2019s home.\u201d He Ying\u2019s voice was clearly emotional right now. The gaze she was directing towards House Jing\u2019an\u2019s gates were filled with both yearning and greed.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen hugged her mother\u2019s arm tightly. Uncertainty and envy showed in her narrow eyes as she took in the large and luxurious gates of the Jing\u2019an Estate and the roofs of the buildings within.</p><br/><p>She gulped nervously, \u201cMother, Grandmother\u2019s home is so huge. I\u2019ve never seen such a large courtyard in my whole life. Can we stay here forever from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of He Ying\u2019s mouth tilted upwards, \u201cOf course. Since we\u2019ve returned, no one can chase us out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu had hurried over with some servants in tow after receiving the report from the gatekeepers.</p><br/><p>Ever since He Ying had married into the Pan Family, far away in Siyang, they hadn\u2019t met at all for decades. Now that she was meeting the He Family\u2019s former Eldest Young Miss again, a mix of emotions welled up within Senior Servant Liu.</p><br/><p>She walked up to He Ying and bobbed in greeting towards her, together with the servants behind her. It was only after a respectful pause that she raised her head and said, \u201cEldest Madam, it must have been a long journey for you. Please, follow this servant into the estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though it had been many years since they had last met, He Ying was able to recognise the senior servant who was even more well dressed than she was.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Servant Liu, I hope you\u2019ve been well since we parted.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, He Ying rearranged her expression into a frown as she took in the servants who had come to welcome her together with Senior Servant Liu. All of a sudden, she let out a mocking peal of laughter, \u201cI see that we\u2019re not that welcome after all, since you\u2019ve only sent servants out to welcome us back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu\u2019s expression changed. She pressed her lips together and managed to hold back the sharp words bubbling up within her. She lowered her head respectfully as she replied, \u201cEldest Madam might not have gotten the news yet. None of the male masters of our house are home now. The matriarch and the countess are both sickly and bedridden, so the honour of welcoming you has been left to this old servant.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying\u2019s brows drew together, \u201cMother is sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu nodded, her heart clearly aching for the matriarch. \u201cEldest Madam and Miss Pan, please enter first and listen to this old servant\u2019s explanation later.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then that He Ying stopped talking and let the maidservants help her and her daughter into the estate.</p><br/><p>The news had been sent to Qingxi Hall already. Perhaps due to the pending reunion with the daughter she had been separated from for decades, the matriarch was much more spirited than the two days before. She forced herself out of bed and on her feet.</p><br/><p>The matriarch let her maidservants help her dress up before letting Muxiang escort her to the hearth in the parlour. It was there that she awaited the arrival of her long lost daughter.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s old eyes remained fixed on the entrance the whole time. Eventually, she urged, \u201cMuxiang, send someone to ask if they\u2019ve entered the inner court.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muxiang covered her lips and smiled, \u201cOf course, this servant will go now. Please don\u2019t worry, Matriarch. Eldest Madam has already entered the estate, it will only take her a moment to come into the inner court. Senior Servant Liu has even sent out sedans for them and specially arranged for the most fleet-footed menial servants to carry them. They won\u2019t be delayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matriarch sighed, \u201cI know that, but I just can\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Muxiang walked over to the parlour entrance and lifted up the heavy drapes covering them, she spotted Senior Servant Liu leading a group of people down the corridor. She turned around joyously and said, \u201cMatriarch, Eldest Madam has arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, welcome them in!\u201d Matriarch He was so happy she almost leaped up from the hearth, giving Muxiang a fright as she hurriedly went over to support the matriarch.</p><br/><p>The haughtiness on He Ying\u2019s face immediately faded the moment Senior Servant Liu lifted the curtains.</p><br/><p>Once she entered the parlour, she fixed her eyes on the old woman sitting by the hearth. Tears seemed to spring to her eyes almost instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He looked down upon the daughter who had left her as a young lady and grown into a middle-aged woman. Her old eyes looked hazy as tears welled up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ying, come to Mother\u2019s side and let Mother take a good look at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying ran forward and threw herself into Matriarch He\u2019s arms. The mother and child who had been separated for years hugged each other tightly and cried their hearts out.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen was at a loss for what to do. She shrunk back and looked up at the kindly matriarch sitting at the head of the room before her attention was attracted by the sumptuous luxury of the parlour furnishings. Her eyes darted here and there, looking over everything with desire.</p><br/><p>TL Note: The titles that the servants use go by the relation of the addressee to the current head of the house.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He, mother of the current count (one generation up) = Matriarch</p><br/><p>He Ying, sister of the count (same generation) = Eldest Madam</p><br/><p>Chu Lian &amp; Madam Zou, daughter-in-laws of the count (one generation down) = Young Madams</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen, maternal niece (one generation down, but not within the family) = Miss Pan (meaning lady of the Pan family)</p><br/><p>The servants use  for Miss Pan, which is literally \u2018cousin miss\u2019, to indicate that she\u2019s related to the family, but not through the direct line.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Perhaps if it was a normal day, then she would allow it as she usually did- even the matriarch regularly doted on Third Young Madam, exempting her from the sunrise morning call so their young madam could sleep in a little bit longer. The servants of Songtao Court were no better; they sympathized with their third young madam and always let her sleep as much as she wanted.</p><br/><p>However, today was different. It was the day of Guilin Restaurant\u2019s reopening, something that Third Young Madam had been planning for quite a few months. The matriarch was also eager to see the results of her work!</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Young Madam, Guilin Restaurant is reopening today! You have to go over there yourself! Senior Servant Liu from Qingxi Hall even sent someone over to ask after you just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Senior Servant Gui\u2019s words, Chu Lian opened her eyes and sighed. She sat up and ordered Xiyan to bring her clothes.</p><br/><p>While dressing herself, Chu Lian told them, \u201cMomo, you don\u2019t have to be so worried. Even if I don\u2019t go there myself today, Guilin Restaurant will still do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Senior Servant Gui believe that? As magnificent as Guilin Restaurant was after the renovation, even though it now looked just as good or even better than that Yuehong Restaurant on Zhuque Avenue, she still didn\u2019t believe that Guilin Restaurant would be able to fill its tables with customers right after opening. After all, its location was less than ideal: surrounded by residential areas and on a deserted street to boot!</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui thought Third Young Madam was trying to placate her like she was a naive child!</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian noticed the doubt in Senior Servant Gui\u2019s eyes, a corner of her lips lifted helplessly. She decided to use the results of today to prove it to her instead.</p><br/><p>Xiyan picked out an apricot-coloured dress with plum blossoms for Chu Lian. It wasn\u2019t too outstanding, but still seemed celebratory enough due to the red plum blossoms on the skirt. Although Chu Lian wouldn\u2019t be making a public appearance at the opening, she had to personally attend to the guests she had sent invitations to.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many invites; only ten in total. She had personally written all of them. After all those months of practice, her calligraphy was finally passable enough to show. All the effort she had put into her daily calligraphy practice had paid off.</p><br/><p>Although there were only a few invites, they had all been sent to the most distinguished guests.</p><br/><p>The Zheng Estate and Prince Wei\u2019s Estate had received two invites each. Lord Ge and the young Marquis Weiyuan had also received one each. Of the remaining four invites, two of them had gone to the Yang Estate, while the other two had been sent to her maiden house, the Ying Estate.</p><br/><p>These were the distinguished guests that Chu Lian had invited today.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian got dressed and slowly enjoyed her breakfast without any sense of urgency. It was only after Senior Servant Gui\u2019s anxious urging that she finally went to Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>Today, it was Wenqing and Wenlan\u2019s turn to accompany Chu Lian. The other maidservants were to wait until it was close to noon before following the two senior servants over to Guilin Restaurant to serve their distinguished guests.</p><br/><p>Fuyan and Xiyan stood by one side and looked at Chu Lian\u2019s slender silhouette.</p><br/><p>Fuyan was completely dumbfounded. She clicked her tongue in admiration. \u201cHey, why isn\u2019t our Third Young Madam worried at all? Will that out-of-the-way restaurant really become a booming business?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan glared at her, confidence written all over her face. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. I believe in Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuyan was still filled with disdain in her mind. She was just speaking the truth, why was Xiyan stopping her?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know where Xiyan got that self-confidence of hers. In her heart, even a person as wise as the matriarch hadn\u2019t been able to save that lousy old restaurant. How could their Third Young Madam be even smarter than the matriarch?</p><br/><p>In the courtyard of the main branch, Madam Zou waved her hand to dismiss the stewards who had come over to give their daily reports. A maidservant passed over a fresh cup of tea to her.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou took the teacup and carefully sipped at it, her lips slightly curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>If she remembered correctly, today was the day that her third sister-in-law was going to reopen Guilin Restaurant.</p><br/><p>Guilin Restaurant was one of the matriarch\u2019s businesses. She knew better than anyone else about the situation of that old restaurant. She admitted that her third sister-in-law\u2019s secret recipes were really quite delicious, but the restaurant\u2019s abysmal location couldn\u2019t be denied: it was too desolate an area to attract a crowd. No one would think to walk over there just for a meal.</p><br/><p>A dead district is a dead business, what more for a restaurant!</p><br/><p>Building up a name for the restaurant wasn\u2019t something that could be achieved in just one or two days. By the time that happened, it would be too late. In the end, all of Chu Lian\u2019s hard work would have gone to naught, only for her to benefit from it.</p><br/><p>When she thought of this, Madam Zou felt especially pleased. Today, she was waiting to see Chu Lian\u2019s disgrace.</p><br/><p>Just as her thoughts were lifting her mood, she spotted He Changqi striding out from their bedroom. When she saw that he had taken special care in dressing up today, she frowned. \u201cDalang, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changqi straightened his collar and ordered a maidservant to bring over his breakfast. He then sat at the table and picked up some chopsticks before explaining, \u201cThird Sister-in-Law\u2019s restaurant is going to open today, so I\u2019m going there to help her out.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Madam Zou heard this, her eyes immediately widened. \u201cIt\u2019s just a small restaurant, why do you have to be there too?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changqi frowned as he looked at her. \u201cBrother Ge, Tiancheng, and Marquis Weiyuan are all going there to support the restaurant\u2019s opening. If I don\u2019t go, who\u2019s going to attend to the male guests?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou stiffened and she looked at her own husband in disbelief. Suddenly, her heart was wavering with uncertainty. She thought back to the day that her husband had brought his friends over for a meeting and she had stolen Chu Lian\u2019s credit. Had\u2026 had they already known before that?</p><br/><p>When he recalled the events of that day, He Changqi lost all appetite. He set down his chopsticks and lifted the edge of his robe as he stood up. Right before he left, he shot a meaningful look at Madam Zou. Finally, he walked right out of the courtyard without even a goodbye.</p><br/><p>Left alone in the parlour, sitting on a fragrant wood chair, Madam Zou\u2019s face turned deathly pale.</p><br/><p>She wanted to call him back, make him turn around with a cry of \u2018Dalang\u2019, but the word stayed stuck in her throat, even long after her husband had already left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

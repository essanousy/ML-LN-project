Other than feeling slightly warmer than usual, she felt great when she woke up from her nap.</p><br/><p>She was helped by Xiyan to the bathroom to wipe down her body. After changing into a loose and comfortable home dress, she returned to her bedroom.</p><br/><p>She immediately noticed the small porcelain bowl on the table and let out an anguished wail, \u201cI still have to drink that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenlan covered her mouth to hide her grin, while Senior Servant Zhong explained, \u201cThird Young Madam, this nourishing soup only takes effect after drinking it long-term. Great Doctor Miao said that you\u2019ll have to drink it everyday for half a month. It\u2019s only been four days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026</p><br/><p>Although the nourishing soup wasn\u2019t hard to swallow and even had a nice aroma, she was still sick of it after drinking it daily. Furthermore, she drank it more than once everyday.</p><br/><p>Under the watchful eyes of Senior Servant Zhong and the other servants, Chu Lian had no choice but to gulp down the soup with an unwilling expression.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know if she was just imagining things, but she started feeling uncomfortably hot inside after drinking the soup.</p><br/><p>She tolerated it for a while, but eventually she couldn\u2019t continue enduring the uncomfortable feeling, so she asked Xiyan, \u201cCut a pear for me, I\u2019m feeling a little thirsty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that it was February, the only fruit available in the capital was pear. Apples hadn\u2019t been discovered yet in the Great Wu Dynasty, so there was no point in asking for those. As for tangerines, they hadn\u2019t been in season for a while now.</p><br/><p>The pears available now had been specially preserved from last year\u2019s harvest using a special method, so they were rather expensive too. Most commoners wouldn\u2019t be able to afford them at all.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Chu Lian kind of missed the modern times where she could eat practically all kinds of fruit during winter.</p><br/><p>When fruits returned to the market this year, she was going to think of ways to turn them into canned fruits or candied fruits.</p><br/><p>Xiyan revealed a troubled expression, while Senior Servant Zhong secretly shook her head at Xiyan.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed that Xiyan hadn\u2019t moved to get her a pear, so she looked at her in confusion, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you going? Could it be that there\u2019s no more pears in the estate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Chu Lian had come up with a plausible explanation herself, Xiyan quickly nodded and agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Third Young Madam. The remaining few have been sent to Countess Jing\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian could only sigh in response. She had them move the braziers out of the room, before she changed into a thinner robe. After making these changes, she was finally feeling more comfortable.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong took the excuse of sending some tea to meet with He Changdi in the study and make a report.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was seated behind the desk with a pile of official documents that he had just completed. His expression was grim and he was obviously in a horrendous mood at this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? Grandmother demanded Guilin Restaurant back!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong nodded, \u201cThird Young Madam has already returned the deed to the matriarch.\u201d</p><br/><p>A shadow covered He Sanlang\u2019s gaze. He stared into blank space, but there was no telling what he was thinking about. Senior Servant Zhong stood to one side quietly as she didn\u2019t dare to disturb him. With how still she was, she looked just like a statue.</p><br/><p>After some time had passed, He Changdi\u2019s deep, magnetic voice resounded, \u201cI\u2019ll take note of this matter. Is there anything else, <i>momo</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong hesitated for a moment, before speaking up a little awkwardly, \u201cThird Young Master, Great Doctor Miao instructed that Third Young Madam must not participate in any bedroom activities within seven days of taking the nourishing soup.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi: \u2026</p><br/><p>Even though he was a man, it was still uncomfortable for him when Senior Servant Zhong was so blunt about it. Great Doctor Miao had already made this clear to him before, yet Senior Servant Zhong was reminding him about it again\u2026 Was he someone who seemed to be lacking in restraint?</p><br/><p>He Changdi coughed to conceal his awkwardness, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, <i>momo</i>. I am aware.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong sigh in relief inside upon hearing his answer. She had been afraid that the youthful Third Young Master would be unable to suppress his desires\u2026 However, Third Young Master had always been a calm and collected person who followed through with his promises. If he said so, he would definitely do it. Besides, this concerned Third Young Madam\u2019s health, so he wouldn\u2019t be careless.</p><br/><p>After making these things clear, Senior Servant Zhong quickly left.</p><br/><p>When evening fell, He Changdi finally left the study and returned to the parlour. He then asked after Chu Lian\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p>Wenlan replied, \u201cThird Young Madam went to visit the countess over an hour ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang thought about it for a moment, before heading off to his mother\u2019s courtyard himself.</p><br/><p>The moment he entered the parlour, he was met with the sight of Chu Lian happily picking up a small slice of snow pear with a toothpick and putting it into her mouth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They have a lot of socialising to do because they have just returned. Just wait for a few more days, and I\u2019ll have Sanlang\u2019s wife take Miss Pan around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s promise immediately stopped He Ying\u2019s sobbing. She lifted her head with a face full of tears and spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cMother, do you mean that for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He grabbed He Ying\u2019s hand and a slight smile finally surfaced on her face, \u201cYou\u2019re my own flesh and blood, when have I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mistakes He Ying made in her youth were already matters long past.</p><br/><p>She had finally gotten to see her daughter after so many years apart. How could she bear to see her sad?</p><br/><p>After leaving Qingxi Hall, He Sanlang and Chu Lian didn\u2019t return to Songtao Court. Instead, they headed straight to the outer court to embark on their trip to Prince Wei\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang personally helped Chu Lian up the carriage and immediately followed after her with a single stride of his long legs.</p><br/><p>Xiyan tactfully went to the next carriage instead of sitting with her master as usual.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at him with her clear eyes, her mouth still slightly agape from the surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Laiyue bring Leaping Clouds out for you earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi glanced at her and casually straightened out his robes before replying, \u201cWho said that the horse has to be ridden if it\u2019s brought out?\u201d</p><br/><p>For lack of a good response, Chu Lian rolled her eyes at him. The noblemen of the capital rarely sat in carriages unless there was some physical reason keeping them from riding.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he afraid of getting laughed at by others for sitting in a carriage with her like this instead of riding on a horse like a man?</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s dark pupils were focused on Chu Lian. Seeing her luscious lips and almond-shaped eyes, he couldn\u2019t help swallowing his saliva. He reached out and pulled her against his side.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nearly let out a startled cry but she held it in. Once she managed to calm down, she realised that she was already sitting on her lunatic husband\u2019s lap.</p><br/><p>Despite the contrast between his black robe and her bright lilac dress, they gave off a inexplicable sense of harmony when put together.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang held the woman in his embrace tightly and dropped a light peck on her forehead. The ruby that hung over her forehead made her little face all the more brilliant.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was already a little uncomfortable when she realised she could feel a certain reaction from his very male body even through his clothes. She started struggling a little and complained with an enraged whisper, \u201cHe Changdi, can\u2019t you be a little more decent!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s sharp brows furrowed together and he used a little more force to keep her flailing body in place. He held her soft earlobe between his lips and gently nibbled on it. His husky voice resounded in her ear, \u201cStop moving, or I might truly lose control.\u201d</p><br/><p>His deep and magnetic voice and the warm breath caressing her ear caused her whole body to turn limp.</p><br/><p>As a result, she turned completely stiff and motionless on He Changdi\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>He Changdi petted her black hair and kissed the top of her head, \u201cSmart girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian leaned against He Changdi\u2019s broad and muscled chest like this for a while. When she finally felt his horniness fade away, she gulped down her saliva and spoke up.</p><br/><p>She raised her head and put some distance between them. Her head tilted to one side as she looked at his handsome and chilly face and stared deeply into his gentle eyes. Chu Lian suddenly pouted and laid back down on his chest. With an aggrieved tone, she asked, \u201cHe Changdi, why does it feel like Grandmother doesn\u2019t like me anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s heart melted from the needy look in his wife\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>With great difficulty, he opened his mouth and spoke in a deep voice, \u201cCall me Hubby.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

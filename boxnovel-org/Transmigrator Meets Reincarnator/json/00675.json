She hadn\u2019t thought that He Changdi would be so cold and indifferent towards her. His gaze hadn\u2019t even lingered even a second longer over her.</p><br/><p>Jingyan bit her lip and made a decision in her heart.</p><br/><p>She only had one chance! If she missed out on this one chance, then she would have to give up on her dream!</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath and put on the most seductive expression she could muster up. Ignoring He Changdi\u2019s order to set down the box and leave, she sashayed up to He Changdi and put the food box down at one corner of the table. Jingyan spoke in a soft voice, \u201cMaster, Madam is worried for your health, so Madam specially told me to watch Master drink the soup down.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold aura that He Changdi had kept under control suddenly burst out in full force. He had been considering the fact that Jingyan had been serving as Chu Lian\u2019s maidservant ever since she had married him, so he had given her some leeway. However, since she wanted to invite her own death, he wasn\u2019t going to show her any mercy.</p><br/><p>Jingyan hadn\u2019t noticed the subtle changes in He Changdi. She was so nervous that her heart was about to leap out of her chest. She couldn\u2019t possibly have taken note of the expression on He Changdi\u2019s slightly bowed head.</p><br/><p>Her slender hand moved to her waist. With a gentle tug, her thin nightgown came undone, revealing her long, snow-white legs and her full bosom\u2026</p><br/><p>Jingyan gathered her courage and leaned over the table, revealing her exposed chest to He Changdi\u2019s sight. Her voice wavered as she offered in a delicate and frail manner, \u201cMa\u2026 Master, this servant will help you drink the soup\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The rage in He Changdi\u2019s chest reached its peak upon hearing Jingyan\u2019s shy words.</p><br/><p>He abruptly lifted his head. The frozen expression on his handsome face had finally changed, but it wasn\u2019t the change Jingyan had been hoping for.</p><br/><p>His handsome mien was slightly contorted into a malevolent expression and his deep eyes were like ancient glaciers.</p><br/><p>Jingyan was scared stiff by that sinister look on He Changdi. Her eyes widened in disbelief as she lost all strength and collapsed to the ground.</p><br/><p>By now, Jingyan had finally realised how stupid her decision had been. However, it was too late for regrets.</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t have any ounce of pity for a woman like this. A corner of his lips tugged upwards into a smirk. That smirk wasn\u2019t sympathetic at all, making him seem even more terrifying and cruel.</p><br/><p>In the next second, the dishevelled and half-naked Jingyan was kicked right out of the study. She rolled and landed right by Laiyue\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>Laiyue: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Following that, He Changdi\u2019s angry roar burst out from the study, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve taken care of her, go and punish yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue\u2019s own expression turned overcast and he glared fiercely at the unconscious Jingyan. He was extremely vexed inside. This damned woman had caused trouble for him!</p><br/><p>Even though he felt very indignant and he wanted to beat Jingyan up to take out his anger for a bit, Laiyue didn\u2019t dare to tarry on fulfilling He Changdi\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>He took out a black bamboo whistle and blew on it. In a short moment, two guards appeared from the darkness. With just a simple hand gesture from Laiyue, the two black-clad guards took the unconscious Jingyan away.</p><br/><p>Laiyue hesitated for a moment before turning back and entering the study.</p><br/><p>He Changdi looked up and swept a cold gaze over the manservant, making Laiyue freeze up.</p><br/><p>Laiyue showed a pained expression as he explained, \u201cMaster, it\u2019s not that this servant didn\u2019t have doubts, but Jingyan was one of Madam\u2019s handmaids\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can shut up now. Take this box of food to Uncle Miao and have him check if there\u2019s anything else in the soup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue didn\u2019t dare to continue explaining for himself. He only agreed and took the box of food in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas Wenqing left yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already gone. When you kicked Jingyan out, Miss Wenqing left immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you\u2019re dismissed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue bowed as he walked backwards out of the study.</p><br/><p>After Wenqing explained everything that had happened, the tension in Chu Lian\u2019s heart faded away. She could finally lay back down and have a good night\u2019s rest.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until before daybreak that He Changdi finished his work and returned to Songtao Court.</p><br/><p>Uncle Miao had actually come all the way over to the study just now because of that aphrodisiac soup, putting He Changdi in an awkward spot.</p><br/><p>Uncle Miao had even assumed that he had some hidden illness! The doctor had insisted on taking his pulse before finally leaving.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian felt someone hold her in her sleep. She struggled a little in her half-awake state, but she couldn\u2019t get free. In the end, she opened her eyes reluctantly, only to meet with He Changdi\u2019s dark and deep gaze.</p><br/><p>He Changdi chuckled and pinched her pert little nose, \u201cYou silly goose. Are you satisfied now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mind was still foggy, so she couldn\u2019t really process what he had said. She pouted and repeated the insult back at him, \u201cYou\u2019re the silly goose!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi didn\u2019t retort. He simply looked at the cute and sleepy Chu Lian in his arms with a warm gaze. He couldn\u2019t resist kissing her fluttering eyelids.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid our little one disturb you these two days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since Great Doctor Miao had diagnosed that she was carrying, the pregnancy symptoms had immediately started up with a vengeance. Chu Lian puked out whatever she ate. Sometimes, she would be able to eat a bowl of food, only for it to come back up later. Her appetite hadn\u2019t been very good in the first place. After the symptoms started, she ate even lesser.</p><br/><p>However, Senior Servant Zhong and Great Doctor Miao had told her that she had to eat even if she didn\u2019t feel any appetite if she wanted to keep the child. Thus, she hadn\u2019t been having a very good time so far.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the three month mark had passed that the symptoms had slowly abated and her appetite had returned.</p><br/><p>Now Chu Lian could down two bowls of rice by herself at one go.</p><br/><p>Perhaps due to the scare from last month, He Changdi couldn\u2019t seem to set his worries aside. He asked about her condition daily and whether the little one had made trouble for her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head. After the first three months, the little bun seemed to have settled down. Other than a slight bump in her abdomen, she hardly felt pregnant by now, other than being just a little sleepier than usual.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

One needs to have the resolution to give up something in order to make ideas a long-term reality.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin admired his mistress a lot for this quality of hers. If he had been the one to come up with this idea, he wouldn\u2019t have the generosity to give away forty percent of the profits just like that.</p><br/><p>Manager Qin noted down all of Chu Lian\u2019s instructions for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I want to be there for the opening day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Qin was happy about that, of course. It was going to be a very important day; the culmination of all of his efforts over the past few days. If he were to get Chu Lian\u2019s approval from this, that would make him even prouder and more satisfied compared to getting ten percent of the profits.</p><br/><p>Before all these events, there had been something else important happening in the capital: Princess Wei\u2019s birthday. It was on the the day right before the eve of the New Year.</p><br/><p>Although Prince Wei\u2019s Estate had always been favoured by the Emperor, both Prince and Princess Wei remained as low-key and humble as possible. It was also precisely because they didn\u2019t go around flaunting or boasting of their favour that they were able to remain in the good graces of the Emperor.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei usually kept it quiet for her birthday and would only hold a small family banquet in their estate. Her birthday was so close to the end of the year anyway, so she didn\u2019t want to disrupt the New Year celebrations of the other noble houses. However, this year was different, because it was Princess Wei\u2019s fortieth birthday.</p><br/><p>Even before her birthday had come, even the Empress Dowager in the palace had instructed her to host a large celebration this year, let alone her husband.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia was in her mother\u2019s room right now, writing invitations together with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, Chu Liu isn\u2019t around now. What are you doing, inviting those people from House Jing\u2019an!\u201d Royal Princess Duanjia pouted, showing her displeasure on her face. She didn\u2019t like a single person from that house except for Chu Liu and He Erlang.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei petted her daughter\u2019s hair helplessly, \u201cYou\u2019re already fifteen. If not for your father and I wanting to keep you with us for two more years, you\u2019d be married by now. How are you still so rash when it comes to these social matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia continued pouting, \u201cMother, you\u2019re still nagging at me! It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand what you mean, but I just can\u2019t see eye to eye with that Madam Jing\u2019an! Did you forget what happened at the mid-autumn banquet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. We\u2019re just inviting them for a meal. Even if you don\u2019t like them, they\u2019re Jinyi\u2019s in-laws. Since you like Jinyi so much, you\u2019ll have to get along with House Jing\u2019an if you want to keep associating with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia rolled her eyes, \u201cFine! Mother knows best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, House Jing\u2019an received an invite from Prince Wei\u2019s Estate the next day.</p><br/><p>Even though Princess Wei was hosting a large celebration this year, it was still very low-key compared to other members of the imperial clan. There were only ten or so noble houses who received invites, so these invites were extremely precious. They were a mark of association with Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>House Jing\u2019an wouldn\u2019t receive an invite normally, since their house didn\u2019t have any connections with Prince Wei\u2019s Estate. However, thanks to Chu Lian, Princess Wei had sent House Jing\u2019an an invite this time.</p><br/><p>Those who didn\u2019t know about Princess Wei\u2019s connection with Chu Lian would think that it was House Jing\u2019an\u2019s prestige that had earned them an invite. He Ying was one of them.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was extremely happy about receiving an invite and took it very seriously. She immediately ordered Senior Servant Liu to prepare the gifts. He Ying pleaded with her mother for half a day before the matriarch finally agreed to bring her and her daughter to Princess Wei\u2019s birthday banquet.</p><br/><p>If not for the lack of other female family members to accompany her, since her daughter-in-law was still bedridden and her granddaughters-in-law weren\u2019t present, Matriarch He wouldn\u2019t have agreed to bringing He Ying and Miss Pan so easily.</p><br/><p>On the morning of Princess Wei\u2019s birthday, He Ying and her daughter got up early to prepare.</p><br/><p>The two of them were staying in a side room in Qingxi Hall now. Matriarch He had given them some of her maidservants to serve them and all of the maidservants had been trained well, so their standard of living was much better than before.</p><br/><p>Eldest Madam and her daughter, Miss Pan, had brought a maidservant each back from Siyang. The one serving He Ying was called Qiuyun and the other serving Miss Pan was called Pinglu.</p><br/><p>Pinglu was older than Qiuyan by a year and was already sixteen this year. She was small and frail-looking. Apparently, she had been trained as a female escort before entering the estate as a maidservant.</p><br/><p>Once mother and daughter were both dressed up, they went to Matriarch He\u2019s bedroom in Qingxi Hall together. Matriarch He inspected their dressing and accessories personally and made sure that there was nothing offensive about them before leading them to the carriage that would take them to Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>The entrance at Prince Wei\u2019s Estate was currently filled with arriving guests. The young royal princes were standing at the door to welcome their guests, along with Princess Wei\u2019s trusted senior servant and court ladies.</p><br/><p>It was Pan Nianzhen\u2019s first time attending such a grand banquet, so she was a little timid. Once she was helped out of the carriage by a maidservant, she kept her head low and followed right behind her mother and grandmother, imitating their every step.</p><br/><p>When Princess Wei\u2019s trusted senior servant, Senior Servant Lan, noticed that House Jing\u2019an\u2019s matriarch had arrived, she walked towards their party with a welcoming smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old servant greets the matriarch. It\u2019s already the end of the year, but our house has troubled Matriarch He to make the trip all the way here. Princess Wei was still telling this old servant last night that she feels guilty for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Lan had a rank as a court lady in the palace, as she acted as Princess Wei\u2019s subordinate. With her rank, she didn\u2019t actually have to bow towards the madams of the various noble houses. She was treating House Jing\u2019an\u2019s party with respect purely due to Princess Wei\u2019s affection for Chu Lian.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

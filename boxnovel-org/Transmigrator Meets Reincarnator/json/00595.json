Eldest Madam He Ying was glaring fiercely at her. Chu Lian had just finished bobbing in greeting to the matriarch when He Ying shot out a question. \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife! Where have you been?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian knew that she couldn\u2019t hide that she had gone to Prince Wei\u2019s Estate. There were so many servants in the estate; one of them had surely seen where she had gone.</p><br/><p>The matriarch didn\u2019t invite her to take a seat, so she remained standing upright in the middle of the parlour.</p><br/><p>Although her voice was soft, her tone was calm. \u201cReplying to Aunt, I went to visit Princess Wei today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you go to visit Prince Wei\u2019s Estate without any reason? Prince Wei\u2019s Estate hasn\u2019t sent you any invites as of late! Sanlang\u2019s wife, are you trying to break up Miss Zhen and Dalang\u2019s marriage?!\u201d He Ying\u2019s face was twisted into a wretched expression and her face was flushed an ugly red. It was clear that she had lost all sense of rhyme or reason.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian frowned with her lips pressed together. She didn\u2019t want to answer He Ying.</p><br/><p>Had the matriarch summoned her so urgently just for this matter? How absurd!</p><br/><p>He Ying stood on the raised platform, her eyes fixed on Chu Lian\u2019s pretty, young face. She was already hopping mad, but Chu Lian was as steady as a pine. She was acting like she was watching some monkeys playing around, and the look in her eyes was bordering on contempt.</p><br/><p>The matriarch wasn\u2019t too happy either. However, while she could hold back her rage with her years of experience, He Ying wasn\u2019t able to keep her cool.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to reply her, He Ying stepped forward and raised her hand, intending to bring it down on Chu Lian\u2019s fair, tender cheek.</p><br/><p>Wenqing was shaken upon seeing what was about to happen, but unfortunately, she was standing at least two metres behind Chu Lian at the moment. She wouldn\u2019t be able to block the slap for Chu Lian in time.</p><br/><p>He Ying was enraged, so her slap carried all the force she could summon.</p><br/><p>She had thought that the tiny and frail Chu Lian would be pushed down to the floor with a bloody lip. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t expect Chu Lian to grab her wrist instead, blocking her blow.</p><br/><p>Despite how slender her wrist was, she actually had quite a bit of strength in her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would advise you to save your energy, Aunt!\u201d The look in Chu Lian\u2019s wide eyes had turned sharp. The fierce aura around her actually shocked He Ying into paralysis.</p><br/><p>\u201cY\u2026 Y-You\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying stuttered, but she wasn\u2019t able to continue speaking.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t believe that the normally gentle, easygoing Sanlang\u2019s wife could actually be this strong.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian threw He Ying\u2019s wrist to one side, causing He Ying to stumble a few steps backwards.</p><br/><p>She bobbed towards the matriarch and said, \u201cGrandmother, it\u2019s getting late. Granddaughter-in-Law won\u2019t impose on you any further. Please have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, she turned to leave.</p><br/><p>However, Matriarch He slammed her cane several times in succession, making dull thuds on the floor. Now angry, she roared, \u201cStop right there!\u201d</p><br/><p>The foot that Chu Lian had just lifted came back down again. She turned back around and looked up at the matriarch, whose face was turning as red as a pig\u2019s liver.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian cast a sideways glance at He Ying, who was showing off a gleeful glint in her eye.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s voice was as calm as ever as she asked, \u201cGrandmother, is there something you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you still remember that I\u2019m your grandmother? I thought that I was just a dying old woman in your eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the first time that Matriarch He had spoken such harsh words to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>The corners of Chu Lian\u2019s lips curved up and she laughed mockingly to herself. \u201cGranddaughter-in-Law doesn\u2019t dare to bear Grandmother\u2019s words!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! What wouldn\u2019t you dare to do? If you really lacked the guts, would you have gone to Prince Wei\u2019s Estate today? It must feel pretty good to have Princess Wei as your backer, huh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The remaining servants in the parlour all huddled down and tried their best to become invisible. This was the first time that the matriarch and Third Young Madam had clashed with each other upfront.</p><br/><p>One of them was the eldest member of House Jing\u2019an, the other was the young madam with both authority and power. It was hard to say who had the upper hand between these two powerhouses.</p><br/><p>Muxiang stood in one corner, her head lowered to hide the smile on her lips.</p><br/><p>She was clearly satisfied with Chu Lian\u2019s current situation.</p><br/><p>If something happened to Matriarch He right now, regardless of whether Chu Lian was in the right, her reputation would be ruined.</p><br/><p>Once Chu Lian was deemed unvirtuous by others, coupled with how she was still childless, Muxiang had ways to make her leave He Changdi, even if Princess Wei tried to protect her!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian took in a deep breath of the cold spring air to calm her emotions. Following that, her limpid eyes landed on Matriarch He, resolution gathering in the clear depths of her gaze.</p><br/><p>She parted her pink lips and said, \u201cGrandmother, when are you going to wake up?!\u201d</p><br/><p>None of the people present in the parlour had expected Chu Lian to say that, let alone Matriarch He. She forgot to breathe for a moment, struggling with the weight of her fury as she glared at Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Before anyone could react, Chu Lian continued, \u201cGrandmother, your bias has gotten out of hand! Aunt may be your daughter and Pan Nianzhen may be your granddaughter, but isn\u2019t Father your son, too? Isn\u2019t Mother your daughter-in-law, and Eldest Brother your grandson? Can\u2019t you think more for their sake as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cHouse Jing\u2019an has only had single heirs for generations. For the sake of giving birth to your three grandsons, Mother spent all the energy in her body and fell ill. While bedridden for decades, she used her own dowry on her medicine to the point of running it dry, but she never touched a single copper coin from the estate\u2019s public funds!</p><br/><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t she successfully opened up the branches of House Jing\u2019an\u2019s family tree? A feat that hasn\u2019t been done in generations! And yet, how have you treated her? She only just recovered from her longtime illness, but you immediately handed over the messy public accounts for her to handle, forcing her to compensate for the accounts with her own money! If Father were to find out that Mother was languishing under your unfair treatment while he was out defending the borders of this country, don\u2019t you think that he would be bitterly disappointed with you?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

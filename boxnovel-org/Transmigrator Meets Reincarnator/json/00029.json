He stared at her with a dark expression on his face.</p><br/><p>He was absolutely certain that this young, beautiful wife before him was the same Chu Lian from his previous life, because they looked exactly the same. However, why was there such a difference in their personalities?!</p><br/><p>The wicked woman \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 from his previous life would never have come this close to him. If she had to choose between him and Xiao Bojian, she would have picked Xiao Bojian without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>However, if she wasn\u2019t \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 from his previous life, why would she meet in secret with Xiao Bojian?</p><br/><p>The more He Sanlang pondered, the darker the look in his eyes. Finally, he inwardly shook his head and laughed at himself. Of course she was the same wicked woman as before; she simply learned how to hide her true self better this time.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed the sudden change in He Sanlang\u2019s face, so she stopped trying to tease him and sat properly by his side.</p><br/><p>He Changdi brushed away some non-existent dirt on his clothes. Then, intending to ridicule her, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s only been three days since we\u2019ve gotten married. Who would have known that my dear wife had someone else in her thoughts this whole time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian frowned as she turned to look at He Sanlang. \u201cMy dear husband, what are you talking about? I can\u2019t seem to understand you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. I didn\u2019t realise that you\u2019d gotten better at acting. Chu Lian, let\u2019s see how long you\u2019ll keep this up for!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after he finished speaking, He Sanlang sat in the corner with his eyes closed, clearly ignoring Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>He treated the pretty little wife by his side as if she was made of air.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t bother herself with him. He Sanlang obviously had a huge bias against her. Trying to make nice with him now would only cause the opposite effect. Why not simply ignore him and take a break? She was pretty tired from spending the whole day making conversation with the womenfolk of House Ying, after all.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sunk into silence, but the rage in He Changdi\u2019s heart only grew.</p><br/><p>He sneered in his heart. Heh! As expected, although she had been acting as if she didn\u2019t care, she was still thinking about Xiao Wujing in her heart!</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see how long you can keep pretending!</p><br/><p>Sooner or later, the day will come when Xiao Wujing falls into his hands. By then, he\u2019d like to see if Chu Lian could still remain calm!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wasn\u2019t thinking as deeply as he was. She had been completely tired out by the visit today. The carriage rode stably over the broad, paved roads. The gentle shaking lulled Chu Lian to sleep in no time at all.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had his eyes closed as he mulled over things in his head. Suddenly, something heavy fell onto his shoulder and he could feel slow, regular breaths blowing against his neck. He immediately froze. Upon opening his eyes, he cast a deep, darkened gaze downward, only to see Chu Lian sleeping defenselessly on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>The woman by his side had a serene expression on in her sleep, her lips slightly tilted upwards. She looked like a defenseless child.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t seen how ruthless she could be in his previous life, he might have thought that she could be a good wife to him!</p><br/><p>As his thoughts ran back to the various events that had happened in the past, the calm and gentle expression on He Sanlang\u2019s face disappeared in a flash. He tried to shuffle away in disdain, but Chu Lian was like jelly, clinging onto him.</p><br/><p>He Changdi couldn\u2019t bear with it any longer and reached out to push at her.</p><br/><p>After Chu Lian\u2019s head was pushed away, she frowned in dissatisfaction and mumbled something he couldn\u2019t make out before rolling back onto He Sanlang\u2019s body. His mouth twitched and he quickly dodged her. This time, Chu Lian didn\u2019t land on his shoulder; instead, her head fell onto his thigh.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was completely speechless towards this woman.</p><br/><p>She managed to sleep through all of that like a dead pig, so why couldn\u2019t she just sleep herself to death?</p><br/><p>This time, He Sanlang was too lazy to bother with her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

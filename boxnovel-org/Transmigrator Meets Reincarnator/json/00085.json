Luckily, Miss Su caught her and held her upright.</p><br/><p>Miss Su also looked tense. Even back at the Ying Estate, Sixth Sister had always tried to appear strong despite being out of favour. However, doing so in a situation like this was just silly; she should\u2019ve just kept her head down instead of standing out.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Sister-in-Law, are you alright?\u201d Miss Su whispered in concern.</p><br/><p>Madam Rong pressed a hand against her forehead before waving her off. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The progression of events even frightened Eighth Miss, Miss Yuan. Even if Chu Lian was disgraced, they would still be fine by virtue of her having already married out of the estate. Plus, she belonged to House Jing\u2019an now, so she would surely be disciplined by Matriarch He. However, now that things were at this point and Madam Huang was clearly angry, if Chu Lian were to mess up, both House Ying and House Jing\u2019an would be pulled down together with her.</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan was a little afraid now.</p><br/><p>She carefully pulled on Madam Rong\u2019s sleeve and begged quietly, \u201cEldest Sister-in-Law, let\u2019s leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Rong looked around her. She did want to leave, but when she caught sight of the occasional glances thrown her way\u2026</p><br/><p>She stiffened up.</p><br/><p>How could she leave in a situation like this? Although no one was speaking, plenty of eyes were watching her!</p><br/><p>If she were to leave now, news might spread that she didn\u2019t care about her sisters.</p><br/><p>Madam Rong felt immensely regretful. To her, Chu Lian was to blame for everything!</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam didn\u2019t do it on purpose. For a young girl, a thousand taels is a huge sum. If Third Young Madam can truly make longevity peach buns that are better than Mr Wang\u2019s, then I\u2019ll give her this coral bracelet to calm her nerves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when Madam Huang had ordered someone to bring Chu Lian to the kitchen, a woman\u2019s voice rang out.</p><br/><p>The crowd slowly parted to let her through. A middle-aged madam dressed in a begonia-coloured sixteen-bolt dress stepped out, accompanied by a group of people behind her.</p><br/><p>Immediately, whispers of discussion sprang up around them. \u201cLady Yang is here! Madam Huang won\u2019t be able to continue doing as she likes now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lady Yang? Chu Lian turned her bright, clear eyes in the direction the crowd was looking in.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged madam was tall and luxuriously dressed without seeming too stately. She exuded elegance all over. The corners of her eyes were slightly tilted upwards, somewhat similar to Chu Lian\u2019s own eyes.</p><br/><p>She took off the coral bracelet on her wrist and passed it over to one of her handmaids. The maidservant then moved forward and placed the bracelet onto a silver tray sitting on a stone table outside the corridor. When the bracelet hit the tray, it produced a clear ringing sound.</p><br/><p>Each coral bead on the bracelet was finely carved with exquisite patterns, and their colours were about the same. Amber jade beads were placed between each coral bead, showing off a beautiful contrast of red and amber. Everyone could see at first glance that it wasn\u2019t just any ordinary bracelet.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was shocked. She tried to remember when this character had appeared in the book she was reading before.</p><br/><p>Lady Yang? There was a character in the novel who matched this identity, age, and appearance. Yang Ge\u2019s wife! She was one of the most influential people among the ranks of the capital\u2019s noble madams. Even Matriarch He had to accord her some respect if they met.</p><br/><p>This madam was one of the original \u2018Chu Lian\u2019s\u2019 greatest enemies\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 had tortured her to death with some cruel methods\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian cast a curious, measuring gaze towards Lady Yang.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t expected that Lady Yang, who should have been working against her, would come out now only to stand on her side.</p><br/><p>What was this called again? The tables have turned?</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to overthink things and make her life complicated, she wasn\u2019t so naive as to think that Lady Yang had come simply just to help her out.</p><br/><p>As expected, she could hear some people talking in the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Yang and Madam Huang have been at odds since they were young unmarried ladies. It would be hard to avoid clashing over this matter today. Unfortunately, that poor Third Young Madam from House Jing\u2019an has become a target.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian laughed inwardly. She didn\u2019t really mind being a target. No matter what Lady Yang\u2019s motives were, that coral bracelet was pretty valuable. What did she need the most now? Money! That bracelet was going to be hers!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Sister Yang has already placed something in the pot, I\u2019ll have to add in my own share.\u201d A young madam with rosy cheeks standing behind Lady Yang spoke up. She looked to be in her twenties, and was dressed in a silk green dress. From what Chu Lian could hear from the crowd\u2019s whispering, this was the wife of the vice minister of the Ministry of Personnel.</p><br/><p>The vice minister\u2019s wife took off a butterfly-shaped golden hairpin decorated with pieces of jade from directly off her head and placed it in the silver tray.</p><br/><p>The other madams behind Lady Yang followed suit, taking a single accessory off and placing it in the silver tray. There were hollowed out gold bracelets inlaid with jade, yellow jade amulets, headdresses with precious stones\u2026 All these high-quality, sparkling accessories were laid out on this ordinary silver tray.</p><br/><p>The younger madams in the crowd were completely wide-eyed in shock.</p><br/><p>What was going on? How did these influential senior madams suddenly start fighting with each other?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

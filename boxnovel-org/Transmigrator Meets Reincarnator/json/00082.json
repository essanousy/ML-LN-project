I expect you to take full responsibility for this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>De\u2019an Restaurant\u2019s Mr Wang didn\u2019t accept requests from just anyone. In the entire capital, he was the only one who could make such beautiful longevity peach buns. It was considered a great honour if he produced a plate for a noble\u2019s longevity feast.</p><br/><p>Madam Huang had gone to De\u2019an Restaurant three times, and spent a whole thousand taels of silver to do so.</p><br/><p>However, the freshly steamed longevity peach buns she had spent so much effort to obtain were now ruined, just like that.</p><br/><p>Madam Huang\u2019s current rage was to be expected.</p><br/><p>Compared to House Jing\u2019an, House Dingyuan was currently much more favoured with the Emperor, as they had an imperial concubine from their house sitting in the palace. If they were to go against each other, House Jing\u2019an would have to bow to House Dingyuan.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the cause of the trouble was House Jing\u2019an\u2019s new Third Young Madam, who had come from the declining House Ying.</p><br/><p>She was most likely going to be utterly humiliated here, and her crime of disrupting the Old Marquis\u2019 longevity feast would probably spread through word of mouth, affecting her reputation.</p><br/><p>The noble madams who had come from similarly poor houses were starting to sympathise with Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Xiyan was in a fit upon seeing the situation. She wanted to squeeze out of the crowd to look for Eldest Young Madam, Madam Zou. If Eldest Young Madam were here, Madam Huang might let her go for Eldest Young Madam\u2019s sake. However, she was being held back by a few maidservants, and she couldn\u2019t get away. She was so frenzied that her eyes were turning red.</p><br/><p>Wei Fengzi noticed that Chu Lian still remained rather expressionless despite the trouble she was in. There wasn\u2019t a single shred of cowardice or fear in her eyes as she stood her ground in the middle of the crowd. Wei Fengzi raised a single eyebrow and she stood up; this just turned more interesting.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a spark of interest flared in the eyes of Royal Princess Duanjia, who was standing behind Imperial Princess Leyao.</p><br/><p>Zou Yuanqin lowered her voice to a whisper that only she and Imperial Princess Leyao could hear. With a smirk on her face, she asked, \u201cImperial Princess, are you satisfied?\u201d</p><br/><p>Imperial Princess Leyao couldn\u2019t resist laughing as she watched the sorry-looking Chu Lian surrounded by the crowd, with fingers pointing at her from every direction.</p><br/><p>She was extremely satisfied! Such an average, useless woman had dared to marry above her rank and snatch her Brother He away. She was going to make this useless woman suffer today; see if she would dare to ever come out of her estate again after this!</p><br/><p>House Dingyuan\u2019s Fifth Miss, Zou Yuanqin, angrily added, \u201cHouse Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam, do you know how much this plate of longevity peach buns are worth?! Let me tell you, without counting the effort my mother put in to procure them, they cost at least a thousand taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gasps of shock rippled through the crowd.</p><br/><p>A thousand taels! That wasn\u2019t a small sum, even to a madam living in a noble estate.</p><br/><p>For a declining house like House Ying, the maximum amount of dowry a legitimate daughter would get was a thousand taels. Someone like Chu Lian, who was neither loved by her father nor favoured by her stepmother, couldn\u2019t even dream of getting that much!</p><br/><p>The corner of Chu Lian\u2019s eye twitched. Wasn\u2019t House Dingyuan way too greedy? Or perhaps it was that Imperial Princess Leyao?</p><br/><p>They wanted her to fork out a thousand taels for that lousy plate of buns! It was practically daylight robbery!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian inwardly pouted. Her entire dowry wasn\u2019t even worth a thousand taels.</p><br/><p>Since these people were trying to push her into this trap, wouldn\u2019t it be silly if she didn\u2019t at least try to fight back?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, she had to get them back!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian put on a shocked expression and looked at the longevity peach buns scattered all over the ground. She then said, \u201cThese longevity peach buns are worth a thousand taels? Fifth Miss, surely you\u2019re joking?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

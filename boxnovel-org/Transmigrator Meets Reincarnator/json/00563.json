Thus, she bore with the pain and shook her head, \u201cMiss Ying, it\u2019s not that Mother doesn\u2019t want to agree, but I\u2019m not the one who can make a decision regarding this matter. Your elder brother sent a letter back saying that Erlang will be the one to decide his own marriage. Furthermore, your sister-in-law\u2019s health is better now. Erlang is her son, so we have to seek her opinion for this too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Furthermore, He Erlang had already informed Matriarch He at the beginning of the year that he had a girl whom he liked and that he would be getting married this year.</p><br/><p>Back then, she had been the one who had requested the Empress Dowager to bestow a marriage for He Sanlang. Count Jing\u2019an had sent a letter from Mingzhou to express his rage over that. Thus, the old matriarch didn\u2019t dare to arbitrarily make decisions over Erlang\u2019s marriage now.</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an was also her son. Though she wanted to pamper her daughter, her son and grandsons were the ones who would inherit the family assets. They were equally important to her.</p><br/><p>Since both sides were dear to her, it wasn\u2019t easy for Matriarch He to speak for one over the other.</p><br/><p>Since her mother had already said so, He Ying understood that it would be difficult to persuade her mother right now.</p><br/><p>She decided to give up for now and changed the topic.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was inwardly relieved when she noticed that her daughter dropped the matter. The smile returned to her face and she happily chatted about other things.</p><br/><p>Neither of them took notice of Pan Nianzhen, who was beside them. Her head was bowed, so that her bangs covered her face.</p><br/><p>Under the cover of her fringe, she breathed a long sigh of relief, while slightly loosening the tight grip on the handkerchief in her hand.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t like strong and burly men like Second Cousin. She preferred beautiful men like Third Cousin and Scholar Xiao.</p><br/><p>Her heart had actually relaxed since the talk about her marriage with Second Cousin hadn\u2019t succeeded.</p><br/><p>As long as Chu Lian remained childless, she trusted that she would definitely become Third Cousin\u2019s woman.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen subconsciously clenched her fists as she was filled with confidence.</p><br/><p>When He Ying left Qingxi Hall\u2019s parlour with her daughter, her eyes narrowed slightly.</p><br/><p>She had already decided to have her daughter marry He Erlang. If the proper way didn\u2019t work, then she would have to try alternative methods.</p><br/><p>He Ying quickly pulled her daughter back to their room in Qingxi Hall.</p><br/><p>She ordered all the maidservants to leave, and had someone trustworthy guard the door. When it was just the two of them in the room, He Ying tugged on her daughter\u2019s arm and sternly asked, \u201cMiss Zhen, tell Mother the truth, are you willing to stay in House Jing\u2019an?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Eldest Madam was idiotic and her personality was greedy and selfish, she truly doted on her only daughter, Pan Nianzhen, with all her heart.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have a son, so she needed her daughter to take care of her in her old age!</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen raised her head to look at her mother, hesitating to speak.</p><br/><p>He Ying was getting impatient, \u201cI\u2019m asking you a question! Why are you still hesitating in front of your mother? If you don\u2019t agree, I won\u2019t force you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen thought about the handsome He Changdi with his refined bearing and his cold temperament. His deep eyes were always impenetrable, carrying an attractive sense of mysteriousness. With that thought, her cheeks instantly flushed. She summoned up her courage and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I understand my own status, so I don\u2019t dare to have any improper desires regarding House Jing\u2019an.\u201d Although Pan Nianzhen usually kept very quiet, she was actually a very manipulative person.</p><br/><p>A classic example of \u2018a dog that bites won\u2019t bark.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had triggered her mother\u2019s competitive nature with just a few words.</p><br/><p>He Ying had always believed that House Jing\u2019an owed her a lot. Thus, as long as her daughter was willing to marry into House Jing\u2019an, there was nothing impossible about it to her.</p><br/><p>She patted the back of Pan Nianzhen\u2019s hand, \u201cMiss Zhen, if you want to marry into House Jing\u2019an, then I have my ways to make it happen. You\u2019re my daughter, so keep in mind, you\u2019re just as good as any of those royal princesses and honoured ladies.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

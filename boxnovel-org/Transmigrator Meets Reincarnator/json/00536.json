He littered kisses over her smooth and tender cheeks to soothe her, \u201cSeven days. You can change to a different tonic after seven days and you won\u2019t have to so strict about avoiding certain foods by then. You\u2019ll be able to eat fruits and drink tea then, but not too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head helplessly when she heard He Changdi\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>At least it was only seven days. If it was one or two months, then she would probably from the suffering.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pursed her lips. All she could do was to accept this reality.</p><br/><p>She tried to pry open He Changdi\u2019s hold around her waist. \u201cLet me go, I want to eat my dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang smiled and loosened his arms. Chu Lian promptly got off his lap and sat beside him.</p><br/><p>To be honest, Chu Lian wasn\u2019t the only one blushing and feeling embarrassed when they were sitting together so intimately. He Changdi couldn\u2019t endure it for much longer either, so it was better for them to sit separately.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian still didn\u2019t have much appetite. She only ate some of the mild-flavoured dishes before setting down her chopsticks.</p><br/><p>When He Changdi noticed that she wasn\u2019t eating a lot, his brows creased together. He personally ladled a bowl of chicken soup and placed it in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eating too little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to waste his good intentions, so she took up a spoon and slowly drank the soup one sip at a time.</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled something she had been wanting to ask, so she turned her head towards He Changdi, who was focused on his food.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Sanlang, where did you get all the money to buy those accessories for me?\u201d Those accessories cost at least four to five thousand taels, which was a rather large sum of money.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s hand hovered in the air for a moment, jade chopsticks still in his grasp. His deep gaze turned towards her.</p><br/><p>The corner of her lips twitched slightly in a guilty manner and she added a sweet call of \u2018Husband\u2019. He Changdi\u2019s discontentment was finally suppressed after he heard that.</p><br/><p>The young couple hadn\u2019t been together for long. Chu Lian was unable to step into the role of a wife and naturally address He Changdi as \u2018husband\u2019 so quickly, unlike the noble ladies who had been born and raised in this era. She still needed some time to completely adapt to it.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang set down the chopsticks in his hand and looked at Chu Lian seriously. He pondered for a moment before speaking, \u201cLian\u2019er, I don\u2019t want to lie to you. I can\u2019t tell you where I got the money from right now. But you don\u2019t have to worry. All of it belongs to me rightfully and I didn\u2019t use any illegal means to obtain that money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t expect to receive such a reply.</p><br/><p>She was slightly shocked, but she didn\u2019t push him for more answers. She had read the original novel, so she knew the general direction that the Great Wu Dynasty would move towards in the future.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to bother with the politics in court and she didn\u2019t have any wild ambitions. As long as she could have a comfortable life with enough money to spend, she didn\u2019t want to interfere with irrelevant matters.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there were certain things that she couldn\u2019t change by herself no matter how much she tried.</p><br/><p>Her only wish was to live leisurely and laze around. As long as others didn\u2019t provoke her first, she would keep to her place.</p><br/><p>When the time came, all she had to do was to make sure that the He Family was moving in the right direction and that their future would be guaranteed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t ask anymore. Even if it\u2019s your money, you shouldn\u2019t spend it so recklessly. If Grandmother and the others find out, they might misunderstand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it so?</p><br/><p>House Jing\u2019an was severely lacking in money right now. They had even been thick-skinned enough to ask her to return Guilin Restaurant. If Matriarch He ever found out that He Changdi had spent a few thousand taels to buy accessories for her, then she would definitely be mad at the third branch.</p><br/><p>The He Family haven\u2019t split off yet and they still lived with their elders. Thus, they had to do everything in a more low-key manner.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang understood his wife\u2019s misgivings and concerns. He reached over and stroked Chu Lian\u2019s hair, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Grandmother won\u2019t find out. Don\u2019t tell me that I still have to ask for permission from others before buying some jewellery for my wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian rolled her eyes. He hadn\u2019t just bought \u2018some\u2019 jewellery. He had brought back almost all the accessories on display at Treasure Pavilion.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat some more.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi added more food to her bowl.</p><br/><p>Seated as she was beside He Changdi, when she watched him eating in such a serious manner, she unconsciously followed along and ate more than she expected.</p><br/><p>She noticed that He Sanlang wouldn\u2019t waste any food no matter his circumstances.</p><br/><p>The couple\u2019s meals usually consisted of three dishes and one soup, a typical amount served in most noble households. However, Chu Lian had improved the menu slightly and their meals tasted better than most. The amount served on the table was also just enough for the couple, so there wouldn\u2019t be much leftover.</p><br/><p>Two days later, the day of Chu Yuan\u2019s coming of age ceremony had arrived.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had already received the invitation beforehand. Furthermore, it concerned her maiden family so she couldn\u2019t just skip the event.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had to go to the Ministry of War today to take over his duties so he wouldn\u2019t be free until noon.</p><br/><p>After the young couple had woken up this morning, Senior Servant Gui and Xiyan came to help Chu Lian pick out a dress to wear to go out today.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian found it strange that He Changdi was still around when she came out of the bathroom. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you have to go to the Ministry of War today? Why haven\u2019t you left yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi glanced at the casually dressed Chu Lian, \u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry. I\u2019ll go over to the Ministry of War after escorting you to the Ying Estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was slightly surprised, \u201cWon\u2019t that delay your official business?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Chu Lian was speaking to He Changdi, she sat in front of the vanity table and let Wenlan style her hair.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had never felt so fulfilled in years.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t Prince Wei\u2019s first time tasting Chu Lian\u2019s cooking. He had had the same thoughts while enjoying the roast duck she had made last time.</p><br/><p>That reminded Prince Wei of something. He wriggled his brows as he said, \u201cBrother, you haven\u2019t tried the roast duck that Jinyi makes yet. Now that\u2019s the best duck I\u2019ve ever eaten. There isn\u2019t enough time today, or I would have asked her to make another roast duck for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Roast duck? How does it compare to the one that Father used to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two brothers had inherited their love of roast duck from the previous emperor. While he had still been alive, he would eat roast duck every few days. Later on, when his health had declined and the imperial physicians advised the emperor to avoid oily foods, he had still eaten roast duck on the sly\u2026</p><br/><p>Prince Wei sent his brother a mysterious smile. \u201cBrother, allow me to keep you in suspense for this. You\u2019ll know whether it\u2019s good or not once Jinyi opens her restaurant. You can go there yourself in incognito to taste it then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? She\u2019s going to open another restaurant? What happened with the other one, Guilin Restaurant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the emperor was asking, Prince Wei explained the incident to him simply.</p><br/><p>The emperor frowned. \u201cHouse Jing\u2019an\u2019s Matriarch wasn\u2019t right in this case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Wei smiled. Although they could comment on these kinds of incidents, they wouldn\u2019t really take any action due to their high status. If they were to interfere even in these small matters, then their citizens would likely think that the imperial family had too much time on their hands.</p><br/><p>The empty dishes on the table were cleared and fresh sencha was placed in front of the two imperial brothers.</p><br/><p>It was rare for them to have these carefree afternoon moments.</p><br/><p>The emperor suddenly asked, \u201cWhy did Jinyi visit you today, Ninth Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of Prince Wei\u2019s attendants had already informed him of the reason Chu Lian had come to the estate.</p><br/><p>Thus, Prince Wei replied honestly to his brother\u2019s direct question.</p><br/><p>The Chengping Emperor frowned again. \u201cWhat? There\u2019s such a thing? What nonsense. The Jing\u2019an Estate is in a terrible mess now, I should have summoned Count Jing\u2019an back earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Wei shook his head. \u201cThese are all matters for the inner courts. Brother, you don\u2019t have to worry too much about this. My wife will help Jinyi settle this when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor chatted a while longer with his brother before Eunuch Wei politely reminded him that it was about time to return to the palace.</p><br/><p>When Prince Wei sent the emperor off at the side entrance, they happened to catch sight of Chu Lian and her maidservants leaving.</p><br/><p>The emperor froze for a moment, but he quickly recovered and turned to Prince Wei. \u201cI\u2019ll entrust the planning for the Thousand Blessings Festival to you then, Ninth Brother. Don\u2019t make it too ostentatious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, Brother. I\u2019ll keep that in mind. I won\u2019t spend too much or waste resources.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having gotten Prince Wei\u2019s promise, the emperor finally left the estate with his entourage in tow.</p><br/><p>The Thousand Blessings Festival was on the 23rd of March. It was also the emperor\u2019s fiftieth birthday this year, one of the major milestones in life. Furthermore, this year happened to be Chengping 20, the twentieth year since the Chengping Emperor had taken the throne and began his wise rule.</p><br/><p>In the past years, the emperor had ordered the celebrations for the Thousand Blessings Festival to be kept simple. The ministers of the court approved of the emperor\u2019s frugal ways. He always kept the celebrations low-key unless it was a major milestone.</p><br/><p>While it was good enough to hold a simple event for other years, since it was his fiftieth birthday this year, they couldn\u2019t just pass it over without a proper celebration. Even the empress dowager, who normally didn\u2019t interfere in politics or the inner courts of the palace, had ordered that this year\u2019s celebrations had to be much bigger than in the past.</p><br/><p>Prince Wei didn\u2019t touch politics and was trusted by the emperor, so he was the best person to plan the banquet this year. Thus, the emperor had given him one last reminder before leaving.</p><br/><p>After they left Prince Wei\u2019s Estate, the emperor boarded an unassuming green carriage under the protection of his bodyguards.</p><br/><p>Right as he entered the carriage, the emperor sent a meaningful look at the Yulin Army Commander, He Lin, who was dressed as a normal martial artist. He Lin looked around him before quickly following the emperor into the carriage.</p><br/><p>He Lin made a cupped fist salute as he kneeled on one knee before the emperor and said, \u201cYour Majesty, how may I be of service?\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor was leaning against the wall, his gaze directed far away.</p><br/><p>His tone was calm, without any particular emotions in it. However, He Lin had served the emperor for many years and he could sense that the emperor was giving off a dangerous air right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend some spies to investigate House Ying\u2019s Second Master. We want to know everything about him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this subordinate will do as Your Majesty has ordered!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Lin didn\u2019t dare to tarry a second longer. He turned and jumped off the carriage, leaping onto his steed. Urging his horse on, he quickly disappeared around the end of the small alley.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian heaved a sigh of relief after leaving Prince Wei\u2019s Estate and boarding her carriage. Before she had left, Princess Wei had promised to help her block the jade token that Matriarch He had sent to the palace.</p><br/><p>As long as the matriarch was held back from meeting the empress dowager before her father-in-law, Count Jing\u2019an, returned, all would be fine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

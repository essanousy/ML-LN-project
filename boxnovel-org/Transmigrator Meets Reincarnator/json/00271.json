It was delivered straight to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know that Matriarch He had been invited as well. Her brows furrowed when she received the invitation from her father.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian seemed to have anticipated her reluctance to attend the banquet and had purposely gotten her father to send her an invite.</p><br/><p>What was he trying to do?!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mood remained agitated until late afternoon, when she brought the invite to Qingxi Hall to discuss the matter with Matriarch He.</p><br/><p>Just as grandmother and granddaughter had settled down in the parlour of Qingxi Hall, they could hear some noise coming from outside.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He hadn\u2019t been in a good mood in the first place. When she heard the disturbance, her expression turned grave. \u201cMuxiang, go outside and find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a short moment, Muxiang returned.</p><br/><p>Her face was full of anxiety as she ran back in without minding her usual etiquette. She hurriedly reported, \u201cMatriarch, the person causing the disturbance outside is a guard from Prince Jin\u2019s Estate. He said that there\u2019s something urgent to report to Matriarch. This servant accidentally overheard a part of it- war has broken out at the northern border!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Matriarch He abruptly stood up in shock.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s almond-shaped eyes had also widened in surprise. However, she had already been mentally prepared for this piece of news, so her reaction was much calmer than Matriarch He\u2019s.</p><br/><p>The news was too much for Matriarch He. Her body wavered before she completely lost her strength and almost fell forward. Luckily, Chu Lian spotted this in time and quickly caught hold of Matriarch He. The maidservants nearby also hurriedly stepped forward to support the matriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother! Are you alright? Are you feeling unwell anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He leaned on Chu Lian\u2019s shoulder as she massaged the bridge of her nose.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, she seemed to have finally recovered some of her spirit. She slowly opened her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m alright now. Quick, let the messenger in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Muxiang rushed out to call the messenger.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian helped Matriarch He to her seat once again. Scared for the matriarch\u2019s health, she told Wenlan to request Great Doctor Miao\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>The worn-looking man was escorted in by the main steward of the outer court. It was only after the messenger showed his token that Matriarch He finally believed that this man was from Prince Jin\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, what\u2019s happening at the northern border?\u201d Matriarch He\u2019s voice was hoarse and carried a heavy sense of fatigue.</p><br/><p>The messenger bowed before he started his report. \u201cThe Tuhun army has gathered outside Liangzhou. The northern border troops have already skirmished with them a few times. Great General Qian is currently leading the northern border troops and doing his best to defend against the Tuhuns. However, the weather is getting worse over there and Liangzhou City is seeing heavy snowfall. The only worry is that the heavy snow might close up the mountain pass and block the supply line\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When two armies are at war, their biggest worry is running out of supplies. The Tuhuns had bided their time for over a decade. It was likely that they had already sussed out the supply times of the northern border troops and had specially chosen this period to mount a surprise attack\u2026</p><br/><p>Matriarch He and Chu Lian both gasped upon hearing this news.</p><br/><p>Once their supplies ran out, the whole army would likely starve to death before the Tuhuns took action. This wasn\u2019t a warm spring day they were facing; the winter over there could even kill the hardy, frost-resistant yaks.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He felt her body turn to jelly. She turned an affectionate yet pitiful gaze upon the young granddaughter-in-law next to her. The words she wanted to say refused to come out of her throat.</p><br/><p>After a short moment, Matriarch He seemed to have rediscovered her voice. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve received your report. You can go back now. If there\u2019s any news, please ask Prince Jin to inform us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard who had played messenger bowed once again before quickly departing.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere inside the parlour was heavy.</p><br/><p>It was only after a long period of time had passed that Matriarch He finally spoke up again. \u201cLian\u2019er, it\u2019s been hard on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian paused for a moment in surprise before reaching out to grasp Matriarch He\u2019s wrinkled hand. She shook her head gently and said, \u201cGrandmother, please don\u2019t say that. When Husband went off to the northern border, no one could have expected those Tuhuns to start acting again after so many years of peace. As the saying goes, danger opens the door of opportunity. Maybe this Tuhun attack might be a good chance for Husband. It\u2019s useless for us to keep worrying here in the estate. Why don\u2019t we invite Eldest Brother here to discuss this matter? Eldest Brother has many connections, so he might be able to look for more news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was getting old after all. Even though she was still wise, her mind wasn\u2019t as quick as it had been. Upon hearing Chu Lian\u2019s reminder, it was like a light went off in her head. She quickly ordered someone to summon He Dalang back to the estate.</p><br/><p>He Changqi\u2019s many connections did come to use. He quickly gathered some news using various channels.</p><br/><p>War had indeed broken out at the northern border. Furthermore, it was snowing heavily in Liangzhou City now. Although the court wanted to send in relief, they were held up by the snows at the foot of the Qin Mountains. The reinforcements and supplies weren\u2019t able to pass.</p><br/><p>The alternate path was to go through Chongzhou Prefecture and go down the Li River to reach Su City. Beyond Su City was Lake Qianshan. However, by this time, the lake had already frozen over and they couldn\u2019t sail across at all.</p><br/><p>With all the roads to the northern border closed, the officials at court were at a loss for what to do! They could only watch the situation get increasingly worse.</p><br/><p>Right at this time, the news of a major case of embezzlement in the neighbouring city of Zhangzhou spread throughout the capital. As part of the Dragon Guards, He Erlang was assisting with the case, so he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to return for another month.</p><br/><p>Prince Jin sent news about Liangzhou every day. Meanwhile, Matriarch He was looking more and more frail as the days passed. Countess Jing\u2019an, whose health had just taken a turn for the better, inadvertently overheard the servants talking about the war in Liangzhou and immediately fainted right over, becoming bedridden once more.</p><br/><p>This winter, the whole of House Jing\u2019an seemed to be on the verge of collapse, as if it would just vanish to the whims of time on the next tick of a second.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

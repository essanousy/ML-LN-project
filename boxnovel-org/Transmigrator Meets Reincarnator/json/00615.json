This place was so cold and deserted that there wasn\u2019t a single maid or eunuch watching the door.</p><br/><p>She softly asked Wenqing who was beside her, \u201cAre you sure this is the place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing nodded in confirmation, \u201cThird Young Madam, this is the place, I saw the princess walk in this direction with my own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The senses of martial arts practitioners were sharper than most people. Even Wenqing\u2019s eyesight was better than Chu Lian\u2019s. In this dark night lacking of any light, Wenqing was able to see things more clearly than Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gaze shifted to the shut doors in front of her, \u201cDid the princess go in there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing shook her head, \u201cI did see the princess walking in this direction, but I don\u2019t know whether she entered the hall or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only a single alley going in this direction from the imperial gardens, so it had to be somewhere here.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s brows creased together tightly. She was in the middle of deciding whether to take a look inside, when Wenqing made a suggestion, \u201cThird Young Madam, it\u2019s better if we wait. This is the imperial palace, Princess Wei will send people here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded, she couldn\u2019t confirm whether Royal Princess Duanjia had been set up and whether she was in danger. What if it turned out to be a multi-layered trap? She couldn\u2019t just jump right into it and get caught herself. The inner palace had never been a place with rules or morals.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she didn\u2019t know what would happen if she went in and what dangers she might face, so it was better to take the safer option.</p><br/><p>He Erlang and Royal Princess Duanjia had been carefully observing the outside. When they realised that the person who had come was Chu Lian, Duanjia\u2019s eyes brightened. She was about to open the windows and call out to her, but before she had the chance to, He Changjue covered her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe quiet, there\u2019s someone else coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the moment He Erlang whispered this to her, two men had walked out from the darkness.</p><br/><p>The man who stood in front was very young. He wore a black brocade robe, and he had a tall and slender physique. It wasn\u2019t until he stepped into a lit area that Duanjia was able to identify him.</p><br/><p>He Erlang fixed his gaze upon the beautiful man beyond the doors and made sure not to miss a single movement or expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian leisurely walked out from the darkness, with One following behind like a shadow.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked up and noticed the man. When she realised who it was, she had the urge to curse at the heavens.</p><br/><p>This damned Xiao Bojian was way too clingy! He truly lived up to his role as the male lead in the original novel. Was he forcibly increasing his screen time?</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s black robe was low-profile but luxurious. One just had to look at the patterns on it to tell that it had been made of an exceptional quality fabric. It was unfortunate that such a great cut of cloth had been wasted on him. A robe like this would definitely look a lot better on He Changdi instead.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly cleared away these random thoughts in her head. She raised her chin a little, facing the man coming towards her with a frown. Wenqing hadn\u2019t expected Xiao Bojian to appear at a time like this. She quickly took a step forward to protect Chu Lian, and took up a ready position to prepare herself. If Xiao Bojian made any moves, she would immediately attack him.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xiao Bojian completely ignored Wenqing\u2019s protective movements. A faint smile appeared on his lips and his peach blossom-shaped eyes stared at Chu Lian with ample tenderness and a fragment of resentment.</p><br/><p>In the next second, Chu Lian heard Xiao Bojian speak, but even before he spoke a word, she already had goosebumps all over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, you\u2019re finally willing to see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he looked even more lovingly at Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026</p><br/><p>What the hell? Had this fellow gone mad since their last meeting\u2026?</p><br/><p>When had she ever been willing to see him, or even tried to see him?</p><br/><p>She had clearly been lured to this place! If Royal Princess Duanjia hadn\u2019t left suddenly, she wouldn\u2019t have been worried about Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s safety, and she wouldn\u2019t have come to this remote part of the palace so hastily!</p><br/><p>Was there a hole in Xiao Bojian\u2019s head? Had he been born without a cranium?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian asked with guarded eyes, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian smiled. His gaze became increasingly gentle. However, when such a meek expression appeared on his face, it made people feel uneasy instead.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian seemed like someone who always had a gloomy expression, so this sudden change only made others more wary.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke these words with a gentle smile, like a kidnapper using some chocolate to entice a greedy child.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had a look of disgust. Did he think that he could trick her like she was a three-year-old?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what do you want? What happened to the princess? Why have you led me here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to beat around the bush with him. If she had the choice, she wouldn\u2019t want to spend even a second more around a person like Xiao Bojian.</p><br/><p>Perhaps noticing the disgust and hatred in Chu Lian\u2019s eyes, the gentle smile on Xiao Bojian\u2019s face instantly froze up, then cracked and completely fell apart.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, it was as if he had changed faces. His face became gloomy as hell, and that perfect face now seemed to contain malevolence.</p><br/><p>His glare locked onto Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if he wanted to see right Chu Lian and find out what she truly thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, do you truly not like me anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, pain and regret showed on Xiao Bojian\u2019s face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

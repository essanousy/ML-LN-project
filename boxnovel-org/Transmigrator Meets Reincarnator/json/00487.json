She probably blamed herself for not teaching He Ying better in her younger years and causing He Ying to become such a dislikeable character. This was also probably why the matriarch was so patient and accommodating to He Ying, especially in her old age.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes narrowed into slits. The apple didn\u2019t fall too far from the tree. Growing up under a mother like that, it was likely that Pan Nianzhen\u2019s personality would be similar.</p><br/><p>Time flew by as the couple were immersed in their chat. Before they knew it, the carriage had already slowed down and come to a stop.</p><br/><p>Someone announced from the outside, \u201cThird Young Master, Third Young Madam, we\u2019ve arrived at Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi lifted his wife off his lap and sat her down gently to one side. He straightened out the crooked phoenix hairpin in her hair before helping her off the carriage.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s handmaid, Jinxiu, was already waiting at the entrance of Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>When she noticed that Chu Lian had alighted from the carriage, she quickly brought a group of maidservants over in welcome.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis servant greets Marquis Anyuan and Honoured Lady Jinyi,\u201d Jinxiu said with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly helped her up from her bowed position.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia in the estate today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jinxiu came over to support Chu Lian as she walked and led her towards the estate as she explained, \u201cHonoured Lady, our Royal Princess has been waiting for you for the longest time! Princess Wei also missed you very much. When Royal Princess heard that you would be coming today, she woke up early this morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi was following behind Chu Lian with a cold expression.</p><br/><p>Seeing how his wife had been taken away by a servant, his heart felt a little sour.</p><br/><p>Also, what had that lowly servant addressed his wife with just now?</p><br/><p>Honoured Lady Jinyi?</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t she be called \u2018Marchioness Anyuan\u2019 now?</p><br/><p>The expression on tall and slender He Sanlang turned overcast. He kept his cool as he followed his wife into Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>Right as they passed the screen wall of the main gates, they met a young man.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang gave pause as he watched Chu Lian bob in greeting towards the man.</p><br/><p>The young man had handsome features and a slender body. He was dressed in a long sapphire robe with a fierce mountain tiger embroidered on it.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had a good guess as to who this man was.</p><br/><p>He strode over to his wife\u2019s side and bowed precisely towards the young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoyal Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest son of Prince Wei\u2019s Estate, Lu Tai, raised an eyebrow in surprise before returning the bow. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Marquis Anyuan came visiting as well. Since this prince has nothing at hand, would Marquis Anyuan have some time for a short discussion on tactics?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi had already agreed the moment his eyes had met with Lu Tai\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>There were two royal princes in Prince Wei\u2019s Estate. The older one, Lu Kang, had already taken a wife at the start of year and had taken up an official position in another province. He would only return home for the New Year. There was only the younger royal prince left in the estate and he had not come of age yet.</p><br/><p>It was rare for Chu Lian to meet the younger royal prince, Lu Kang, when she came to visit Prince Wei\u2019s Estate, so this was an interesting coincidence.</p><br/><p>He Changdi glanced at his wife before following the royal prince to the main study in the outer court.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian followed Jinxiu into the inner court to meet Royal Princess Duanjia and Princess Wei.</p><br/><p>She was helped onto a sedan and brought into Princess Wei\u2019s courtyard within fifteen minutes.</p><br/><p>Once the sedan came to a halt, the curtain flap was immediately lifted forcefully from outside.</p><br/><p>Following after was a loud complaint, \u201cChu Liu! Were you having too much fun up in the north? Why did you take so long to come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian felt speechless upon seeing that Royal Princess Duanjia had already stuffed most of her head into the sedan to glare at her.</p><br/><p>She quickly alighted from the sedan and smiled as she blinked innocently, \u201cGood day to Royal Princess Duanjia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia quickly helped her up from her bow and rolled her eyes, \u201cGood? What\u2019s good about these days? I\u2019ve been dying of boredom in my estate while you were out living free and happy as a lark!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s smile grew even wider. If living in the north could be termed \u2018free and happy\u2019, then there wouldn\u2019t be so few people living there.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia tugged at her arm, \u201cHurry up, let\u2019s go in, Mother\u2019s waiting for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them walked into the courtyard with linked arms as they chatted, \u201cChu Liu, did you bring any presents? If you didn\u2019t, I won\u2019t forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian chuckled, \u201cWould you like some pearls? Agate? Or maybe some rubies and sapphires?\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia turned her head away haughtily, acting like she couldn\u2019t be bothered with Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian covered her mouth to hide her grin. She turned her wide and innocent gaze on Royal Princess Duanjia, \u201cAlright, alright. I know Royal Princess loves to eat the most. I brought some new foods for you to try. We can eat them together with Princess Wei later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s words made Royal Princess Duanjia cheer right up.</p><br/><p>The edges of her mouth were curved upwards, \u201cReally? Tell me what it\u2019s made of!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s lips were pressed together into a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, Chu Liu! We haven\u2019t seen each other for a few months and you\u2019ve already turned bad! Don\u2019t forget that you still owe me a roast duck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian resisted the urge to sweat. How much did Duanjia love eating roast duck? It had already been a few months and she still remembered that promise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, since I\u2019m free today, why don\u2019t we make it today? Otherwise, you\u2019ll keep thinking of it night and day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s eyes were sparkling now.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian found her reaction a little overboard, \u201cRoyal Princess, do you like eating roast duck that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon getting questioned by Chu Lian, Royal Princess Duanjia abruptly sunk into silence and the smile that had been on her face slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who likes roast duck, it\u2019s my father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was stunned speechless.</p><br/><p>Prince Wei?</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia sighed, \u201cActually it was Grandfather who loved eating roast duck. It\u2019s almost the anniversary of Grandfather\u2019s death in a few more days, so Father hasn\u2019t been in a very good mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian really hadn\u2019t seen this coming. Who could have thought that a simple roast duck would somehow involve the previous Emperor?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

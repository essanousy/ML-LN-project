Amongst the three young masters of the He Family, He Sanlang was undoubtedly the best in terms of appearance, while He Erlang was second. Coming in last was the eldest, He Dalang, who resembled Count Jing\u2019an the most and wasn\u2019t very appealing.</p><br/><p>However, He Sanlang had just married last year, while He Dalang hadn\u2019t even been in their considerations originally. Well, but who could have seen his divorce coming? He didn\u2019t even have a son yet, so thinking about it now, he was actually a great choice as well.</p><br/><p>When a lady chooses her husband, she can\u2019t make a decision based on the prettiness of his looks alone, she had to consider his status as well.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen looked back up with teary eyes, resisting her mother\u2019s decision timidly, \u201cB-but, I don\u2019t like Eldest Cousin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying truly hated how her daughter couldn\u2019t see the big picture. Right now, it didn\u2019t matter whether she liked him or not. She had already given her virginity to him, so she no longer had a choice.</p><br/><p>But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to break this to her daughter, so she tried to console her from a different angle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eldest cousin\u2019s looks may be average, but he\u2019s the heir of the estate. When your uncle retires, his countship will be passed down to him. By marrying your eldest cousin, you\u2019ll become Countess Jing\u2019an in the future. Your eldest cousin doesn\u2019t have a son yet, so if you bear a son for him, you\u2019ll produce the next heir to House Jing\u2019an\u2019s future heir. That will only make your grandmother love you even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying\u2019s kind persuasion made a visible change to Pan Nianzhen\u2019s expression, but no one knew how she actually felt inside.</p><br/><p>An hour later, He Ying got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve said my piece. You should think for yourself whether my words make any sense to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen nodded dazedly, and He Ying bent over to stroke her daughter\u2019s hair. With a sigh, she left Pan Nianzhen\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>After He Ying left, Pan Nianzhen remained seated on the bed for a long time.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she raised her head to look at the servant by her side, \u201cPinglu, do you think I should just resign myself to my fate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pinglu lowered her head as she didn\u2019t dare look into Pan Nianzhen\u2019s eyes. Her eyes darted around the room for a few moments before she softly replied, \u201cThis\u2026 this servant doesn\u2019t dare to make such a statement\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t seem like Pan Nianzhen was looking for an answer from her at all. She gazed at the floor. At a volume that only she could hear, she muttered, \u201cI just can\u2019t accept this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment Xiao Bojian left Sixth Prince\u2019s estate, he received a letter from One.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian first boarded the carriage with the letter in hand, while One followed him into the carriage shortly after.</p><br/><p>Once One had taken a seat, his master asked, \u201cWho is it from?\u201d</p><br/><p>One shook his head, \u201cThis subordinate doesn\u2019t know, this subordinate received it from a child on the streets. The child said that it\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already interrogated him. The child knows nothing. He was given a little money to pass on the letter.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sinister cast fell over Xiao Bojian\u2019s face for a moment. He opened the letter, and quickly skimmed through its contents.</p><br/><p>When he was done digesting the contents of the letter, his eyes widened in disbelief, while the hand with which he was holding the letter trembled.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s incredibly beautiful face suddenly turned flushed. It wasn\u2019t due to anger at all, but excitement.</p><br/><p>He gripped the letter tightly while trying his utmost to contain the rising excitement that was about to explode.</p><br/><p>However, he was still young. He didn\u2019t have the mature calm and shrewdness of his previous lifetime.</p><br/><p>When One saw that his master\u2019s face had tensed up and become a little contorted, seemingly trying to suppress his emotions and failing to, he became concerned and asked, \u201cMaster, is something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>One\u2019s question helped to pull Xiao Bojian back to reality. Xiao Bojian quickly readjusted the expression on his face and threw the letter into the brazier in the carriage.</p><br/><p>The fire flashed once, and the letter was reduced to ashes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

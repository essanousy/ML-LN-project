(3)</strong></p><br/><p>Just as the tent was filled with sounds of merry-making and chatter, a guard posted outside the tent came in to report.</p><br/><p>He Changdi set down his chopsticks and asked with a cold expression, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard was one of He Changdi\u2019s men, so he replied very respectfully, \u201cMy lord, Great Steward Wei has arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>By Great Steward Wei, the guard was referring to the emperor\u2019s trusted attendant, Eunuch Wei Chenghai.</p><br/><p>Why had he chosen to visit during mealtime?</p><br/><p>Of course, everyone in the tent had heard He Changdi\u2019s conversation with the guard.</p><br/><p>They all set down their chopsticks as Eunuch Wei was ushered in by the guard.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei entered the tent with two younger eunuchs behind him, one of them even carrying a container for food.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei first greeted everyone with a bow, before smiling as he made small talk, \u201cAh, what a coincidence, even Old Duke Zheng and Your Highness are here! I wonder what delicacy Honoured Lady Jinyi has made this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had mentioned Chu Lian in his question, the task of answering him naturally fell upon her shoulders. \u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t any sort of delicacy, Eunuch Wei. I only told my maidservants to make a few simple dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eunuch\u2019s smile became even warmer, \u201cYou must be joking with me, Honoured Lady. I could smell that fragrance from all the way over there. It was quite particular.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian almost choked on her saliva after hearing Eunuch Wei\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>She shot a nonchalant glance over at the entrance of the tent. Just as the eunuch had said, the emperor\u2019s luxurious tent could be seen not too far away. The easterly winds were blowing today as well, and they had been cooking upwind. No wonder they had been able to smell it from the emperor\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>If not for Eunuch Wei still present at the scene, Chu Lian might have let out an expression of regret.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had been observing their interactions and he found Eunuch Wei\u2019s attitude towards his wife rather strange. Before Chu Lian could reply once more, he stepped forward to block his wife from view. He cut in with, \u201cMay I ask what business Gonggong has here?\u201d</p><br/><p>A tiny wrinkle developed on Wei Chenghai\u2019s brow. He wasn\u2019t very happy with the way He Changdi had interrupted his and Chu Lian\u2019s conversation. However, he was used to navigating treacherous social waters amongst the officials, so he wouldn\u2019t show this little bit of dissatisfaction on his face.</p><br/><p>His lips remained spread in a smile, \u201cWell, it\u2019s rare for such a chance to present itself. His Majesty would also like to try Honoured Lady\u2019s cooking. Thus, I\u2019ve come over shamelessly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei sent a signal at the young eunuch behind him. The young eunuch quickly responded by offering up the food container in his hands, \u201cHis Majesty said that we couldn\u2019t let Honoured Lady offer up her food without a gift in return, so this is a reward for Honoured Lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t refuse a gift, what more something bestowed by the biggest boss in the Great Wu: the emperor.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian received the box with both hands and made her gratitude known. When she turned around, she shot a reassuring look at her husband.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian worked swiftly. Since it was something to be served to the emperor, she had to cook it herself. All Wenqing and Wenlan could do was to help with some minor tasks at the side. Furthermore, they had to be very careful with something made for the emperor.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the dishes weren\u2019t very complicated and she finished cooking in just forty-five minutes. She handed over the food to Eunuch Wei directly, and he quickly left for the emperor\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>Once she was done cooking, the others in the tent had already had their fill. Since they still had some hunting to do in the afternoon, everyone quickly dispersed and returned to their own tents.</p><br/><p>When only Chu Lian and He Changdi were left in their tent, Chu Lian opened up the box that Eunuch Wei had sent over.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gaped in surprise at the contents. The box was completely filled with birds\u2019 nest!</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t the normal grade of birds\u2019 nest either; these were top quality blood birds\u2019 nests, in the most perfect crescent shapes.</p><br/><p>Products of this quality were usually used as tributes in the Great Wu, and there were very few of them in number. These were sent over from the Xinluo Country every year and only the most esteemed and respected women in the palace could enjoy these.</p><br/><p>Even in the modern world, this kind of birds\u2019 nest was considered extremely rare and precious.</p><br/><p>Why would the emperor gift her such valuable items for no reason\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stared at the huge pile of blood birds\u2019 nests with her eyebrows drawn together. She looked up at He Changdi, who seemed to be brooding over the gift as well, \u201cHubby, what do you think His Majesty is thinking by sending such precious gifts\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s profound gaze flickered over to Chu Lian. All the events of today had also left him rather confused.</p><br/><p>He caressed Chu Lian\u2019s cheek gently and shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t discern His Majesty\u2019s intentions for now. Let\u2019s just wait and watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she couldn\u2019t understand what was going on either, Chu Lian simply set aside her thoughts and ordered Wenqing to put away the top-quality birds\u2019 nest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give some to Mother when we return.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s illness had already been cured, she had struggled with it for so long that her body was sorely lacking in vigour. The nutritious birds\u2019 nest was exactly what she needed to boost her health right now.</p><br/><p>Warmth suffused He Changdi\u2019s heart. He pulled Chu Lian over into his lap.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I just sent some medicinal ingredients over to Mother a few days ago,\u201d He Changdi placed light kisses down her cheek as he explained in a low tone.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian took his hand and started playing with his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have any use for this birds\u2019 nest! My body\u2019s perfectly healthy, I don\u2019t need to eat things like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eating nutritious products like birds\u2019 nest when it wasn\u2019t needed could instead cause adverse effects to her body and affect her health.</p><br/><p>However, He Changdi didn\u2019t catch Chu Lian\u2019s meaning immediately, and his mind somehow turned on a crooked path instead.</p><br/><p>He bent down closer to her ear and let out a low chuckle, \u201cWhat, are you worried that you\u2019ll be overly \u2018nourished\u2019 again? Don\u2019t worry. With me around, we can work together to extinguish your fires anytime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was in awe of how He Changdi\u2019s mind could twist anything into something perverted!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

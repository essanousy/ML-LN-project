Either action would\u2019ve led to the same result, so why not let him know that she wasn\u2019t someone he could bully? Even if he wanted to play his sneaky tricks on her next time, he would think twice before trying it again.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s words made Xiyan come to a sudden realisation.</p><br/><p>So it wasn\u2019t such a simple event after all. There were all these unseen twists in the middle of it.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was a little down now. Anyone else would be pretty happy after getting a noble title, but she wasn\u2019t the slightest bit elated. Conversely, she was deep in worry.</p><br/><p>Who would want this honoured lady title? Royal Princess Duanjia had done her a disservice with this move.</p><br/><p>What Chu Lian didn\u2019t know was that this surprise gift hadn\u2019t come about with just the efforts of Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia. Prince Jin had also helped out in getting her this title!</p><br/><p>When she returned to Songtao Court and saw the parlour full of gifts from the bestowal of her honoured lady title, she waved her hands and had Senior Servants Gui and Zhong take care of it.</p><br/><p>Although she hadn\u2019t been given an accompanying medal or token of immunity along with the noble title, the Emperor had personally picked out a name for her. That honour meant that she could stand on par with any feudal princess now.</p><br/><p>An honoured lady was given a set of appropriate dresses for court gatherings and their matching headdresses. Other than that, she had also been given a small estate in the capital, about 6 hectares of good farmland and a hundred pieces of gold. These were all part of the standard awards for an honoured lady. Other than the special name \u2018Jinyi\u2019, the Emperor hadn\u2019t added on anything more.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pointed at the headdresses and said a little helplessly, \u201cPlace those together with the phoenix tail hairpin that Royal Princess gave to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that she had a noble title, she could wear the simplest phoenix tail hairpin and no one would say anything bad about her.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui held up a stack of court dresses. \u201cThird Young Madam, why don\u2019t you try these on? If they don\u2019t fit, we have to adjust them as early as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had suffered a series of shocks and surprises this morning, so she wasn\u2019t in the mood to play dress up. Furthermore, these court dresses were made out of cloud-pattern brocade and were extremely thick. If she tried them on, she would probably start sweating.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try them tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Gui could only put away the clothes.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian returned to her own little study and took out the purse that the eunuch had given her. She had only taken a short glance inside just now, and estimated that there was about 800 taels inside. After carefully counting, she realised that there were actually over 1200 taels\u2019 worth of banknotes inside.</p><br/><p>Imperial Concubine Wei really didn\u2019t lack money at all!</p><br/><p>Exchanging that golden qilin had earned her quite the tidy sum.</p><br/><p>She handed the banknotes to Xiyan to keep safely together with the rest of her savings.</p><br/><p>Then, Chu Lian drank a bowl of sweet soup, had a quick bath, and settled down for a nap.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He gave Senior Servant Liu some instructions as she slowly savoured a bowl of birds\u2019 nest soup. \u201cSend someone over to Dalang\u2019s wife and have her make two more outfits suitable for a fifth-ranked noble wife for Sanlang\u2019s wife. And also, have her make two more phoenix tail hairpins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu voiced her acknowledgement of the orders, but didn\u2019t immediately send someone off to execute them. She stood by Matriarch He\u2019s side as if she had something to say but did not dare to speak up.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He cast a sideways glance at her. \u201cWhy? Do you think this old woman isn\u2019t being fair to Dalang\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old servant doesn\u2019t dare to question Madam!\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He set down the jade bowl in her hands and said, \u201cXiangyun, I\u2019ve given her enough time. Dalang can\u2019t go without a male heir. If Dalang\u2019s wife can\u2019t even hold herself together over this small matter, then how will she face the day that Dalang takes a concubine? Dalang will be the one to shoulder the responsibility of taking care of this family in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Matriarch He\u2019s words, Senior Servant Liu suppressed the concerns that she had wanted to bring up. She simply agreed with the matriarch and turned to do her bidding.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>When Madam Zou received the news, she couldn\u2019t hold back her rage and immediately threw a teacup to the ground, scaring the trembling maidservant who had passed on the message.</p><br/><p>However, as angry as she was, she couldn\u2019t disobey Matriarch He\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>She tried her best to suppress the fire in her heart. At night, when Dalang tried to initiate intimacy with her, she didn\u2019t have the mood to acquiesce. Although both husband and wife slept on the same bed, they had different thoughts in mind this night.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

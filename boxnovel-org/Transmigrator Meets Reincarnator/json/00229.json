Her smile was full of hidden meaning as she also looked at Xiyan and Mingyan.</p><br/><p>After hearing Chu Lian\u2019s additional explanation, Xiyan had obviously relaxed, but Mingyan suddenly tensed.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian continued staring at the two handmaids. There was no small amount of pressure on them, facing down those piercing eyes. Xiyan and Mingyan\u2019s hearts were beating like drums.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me honestly what you think about this. No matter what your choice is, I won\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Xiyan took in a deep breath and found the courage to look up. In a trembling voice, she said, \u201cThird Young Madam, this servant doesn\u2019t want to stay behind. This servant\u2026 only wants to serve by your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was only startled for a moment. She smiled. \u201cThen just stay by my side. Mingyan, what about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s answer lifted the great burden in Xiyan\u2019s heart. She looked at her master with slightly misty eyes before moving to one side.</p><br/><p>When Mingyan heard Xiyan\u2019s response, she clearly became even more nervous. After a fierce battle with herself, Mingyan still chose the path that was the most beneficial to herself. She looked up into Chu Lian\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cThird Young Madam, this servant is willing to stay behind to look after Old Duke Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mingyan had a pair of large eyes with double eyelids. Compared to Fuyan\u2019s liveliness, she was much more taciturn. The original novel hadn\u2019t described Mingyan much. Chu Lian also hadn\u2019t noticed any shortcomings in her personality after observing her for a few days. However, as she was someone serving her so closely, Chu Lian would always find a way to test her personality. Today\u2019s problem was one such chance. Unfortunately, Mingyan had clearly disappointed her.</p><br/><p>However, this was her own choice, so Chu Lian wasn\u2019t going to blame her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s expression didn\u2019t reveal any trace of her inner thoughts. She smiled sweetly and said, \u201cAlright, then you\u2019ll stay and take care of Old Duke Zheng. Since you\u2019re my handmaid, don\u2019t disgrace my name. Don\u2019t be stingy with the secret recipes you\u2019ve learned from me and use them generously for Old Duke Zheng\u2019s meals. As for the rest of the arrangements, leave it to me and Grandmother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mingyan hadn\u2019t expected Chu Lian to have agreed so quickly; her sudden happiness showed on her face. She secretly glanced at Chu Lian before looking carefully at Matriarch He. It was only after observing their expressions that Mingyan finally relaxed.</p><br/><p>She began to look forward to her new life in the Zheng Estate.</p><br/><p>In the end, as smart as Mingyan was, she was only a young maidservant who hadn\u2019t seen much of the world. As ambitious as she might be, there was a limit to her vision.</p><br/><p>Since they had already finished their discussion and there wasn\u2019t any need for the other ideas she had prepared, Chu Lian instructed Mingyan on a few other things before helping Matriarch He out of the room.</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng hadn\u2019t thought that a simple handmaid serving Chu Lian could know so many secret recipes. She was full of shock and surprise, as well as disbelief. A single secret recipe was already rare enough. Even if Chu Lian could cook well, she couldn\u2019t possibly be so generous as to teach all of her recipes to her handmaids!</p><br/><p>Taking in their disbelief, Chu Lian smiled and asked someone to prepare some ingredients. She then told Mingyan to show off her skills for the old duchess.</p><br/><p>Mingyan prepared some dragon beard noodles. Rolling out the dough and cooking the noodles were not skills that normal people would know.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the finished dish was placed before Old Duchess Zheng that she finally believed that Chu Lian\u2019s handmaid was actually a skilled cook.</p><br/><p>Since she had proven her skill, Mingyan was left behind to take care of Old Duke Zheng\u2019s meals. Old Duchess Zheng also knew that this was Matriarch He\u2019s largest concession to her request, so she personally escorted Matriarch He and Chu Lian all the way to the outer court together with her daughter-in-law.</p><br/><p>Just as they were preparing to board their carriage, Heir Zheng rushed over.</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng was young, and good at flattery. The moment he arrived, he greeted Matriarch He and thanked Chu Lian for the feast the other day. Finally, he asked about the opening of Guilin Restaurant.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was a little surprised. \u201cHeir Zheng, how did you know that I\u2019m about to open up a restaurant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng grinned. \u201cI heard Brother He talking about it a few days ago. When the time comes, please don\u2019t forget to send me an invite, Honoured Lady Jinyi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was what had happened. Chu Lian smiled. Heir Zheng was so straightforward that it was hard to be annoyed by him.</p><br/><p>After exchanging some pleasantries, Chu Lian followed Matriarch He back to the Jing\u2019an Estate.</p><br/><p>After he watched House Jing\u2019an\u2019s carriage leaving the Zheng estate, Heir Zheng turned to his grandmother and mother curiously. \u201cI heard that Honoured Lady Jinyi left her handmaid behind in our estate. What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Duchess Zheng heard his question, she glared at him. \u201cYou keep playing around and skiving off on your work just to pry into small matters like this? Why do you want to know all these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng had always had a sweet tongue around others, especially senior members like his mother and grandmother.</p><br/><p>He hugged Duchess Zheng\u2019s arm. \u201cMother, like you said, it\u2019s just a small matter. Since it\u2019s something small, just tell me~ Then I won\u2019t have to go and ask other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duchess Zheng only had one son, so she normally pampered him a lot. She looked at her son helplessly before poking him in the forehead. \u201cThe handmaid that Honoured Lady Jinyi left behind is good at cooking. She\u2019s here to take care of your grandfather, so don\u2019t go around making trouble for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng was surprised by this answer. \u201cGood at cooking? Then how is she compared to Honoured Lady Jinyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng glared at her grandson. \u201cHow could she be compared to Honoured Lady Jinyi? She was taught by the Honoured Lady herself. Didn\u2019t you say that you\u2019ve tasted the Honoured Lady\u2019s skills? If you try that handmaid\u2019s cooking in the future, then you\u2019ll know for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Heir Zheng heard this, he couldn\u2019t help but grow excited. With the meal he\u2019d had back at the Jing\u2019an Estate, it was no surprise that he had some high expectations.</p><br/><p>It was already late afternoon by the time Matriarch He and Chu Lian finally returned to the Jing\u2019an Estate.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian escorted Matriarch He back to Qingxi Hall first. Right before she left, Matriarch He sent all the servants out of the room. She held Chu Lian\u2019s hand and spoke intimately with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou silly child. How could you send your handmaid off just like that? Now there\u2019s one less person serving you. How about having Grandmother\u2019s Muxiang serve you?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

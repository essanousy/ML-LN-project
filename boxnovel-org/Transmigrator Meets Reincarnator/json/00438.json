Since Third Young Madam isn\u2019t here, we servants can\u2019t act on our own initiative.\u201d Although Xiyan was speaking tactfully, the meaning in her words was clear: the clothes that Princess Wei had given to Chu Lian couldn\u2019t be lent to her.</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen scrunched up the handkerchief in her hands, showing her displeasure. She wanted to continue insisting, but Senior Servant Liu quickly jumped in upon seeing the situation turning bad. \u201cMiss Pan, these clothes over here are all in the latest styles and colours trending in the capital this year. Miss Pan will surely look good in them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Nianzhen\u2019s hopes were left unfulfilled. In the end, she picked from the winter clothes that the estate had given to Chu Lian for the year. In a fit of temper, she picked out six sets of clothing from the closet, practically taking all of the winter clothes that Chu Lian had been given.</p><br/><p>Xiyan stood to one side and watched. Although her heart ached for the clothes taken away, she couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it as a mere servant, especially since her masters weren\u2019t even around.</p><br/><p>All she could do was to stand by respectfully and let Miss Pan Nianzhen take them away.</p><br/><p>Once the group of visitors had taken a box full of clothing and left Songtao Court, the second-tier maidservant Baicha asked, \u201cSister Xiyan, are we going to let those people take Third Young Madam\u2019s things away just like that? This servant thinks that that Miss Pan isn\u2019t a good person at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan turned around and shot a glare at Baicha, \u201cWe\u2019re servants. Even if we want to protect our Third Young Madam, we can\u2019t go over the authority of the other masters in this household. We have to keep our thoughts in our hearts and remember everything that happens. We\u2019ll report all of these to Third Young Madam when she\u2019s back. Third Young Madam will know what to do. Also, while it\u2019s fine for you to say something like that in front of me, keep your lips sealed around others, or we might accidentally make new enemies for our masters. While our masters aren\u2019t around, we servants of Songtao Court must behave ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baicha nodded, \u201cBaicha will remember Sister Xiyan\u2019s teachings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t just hang around me now. Go and put Third Young Madam\u2019s clothes back in order. Record all of the clothes that Miss Pan just took. We have to make sure we keep our records straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting her orders, Baicha went off to do her work.</p><br/><p>Xiyan watched as the young girl hurried off diligently and smiled.</p><br/><p>Although Baicha was only twelve this year, she was good at her work. In fact, she was even more trustworthy than Jingyan and Fuyan.</p><br/><p>When Senior Servant Liu returned to Qingxi Hall, she mulled over the issue for some time before reporting what Pan Nianzhen had done at Songtao Court to Matriarch He.</p><br/><p>The matriarch\u2019s first reaction was stunned amazement. Later, she sighed, \u201cThat child has grown up by her mother\u2019s side all these years and has never seen enough of the world. Since it\u2019s her first time here, she\u2019s more shallow-minded. It\u2019s still within the realm of forgiving. Xiangyun, tell the inner court steward to add a few more headdresses and accessories for Miss Ying and her daughter. Take another two headdresses from my personal stores for them too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Liu hadn\u2019t expected such a reaction from Matriarch He. Not only had she not increased her guard against them, but she was even pitying Eldest Madam and her daughter. While Senior Servant Liu wanted to try persuading otherwise, she knew clearly that Matriarch He wouldn\u2019t listen to her at this time. Thus, she could only resign herself to following her orders.</p><br/><p>Eldest Madam He Ying was in her forties this year. Her figure was slightly plump and her round face was similar to Matriarch He\u2019s, but with fewer wrinkles. The two lines framing her mouth were rather deep, giving her a mean appearance.</p><br/><p>After her afternoon nap, He Ying started strolling about Qingxi Hall. She looked closely at every corner of it. This courtyard hadn\u2019t changed much overall since she had left, but there were a few parts that had changed a lot.</p><br/><p>The furniture and arrangements throughout the courtyard had become even more lavish. She could tell that Qingxi Hall had gone through at least two renovations after she had left to marry in Siyang.</p><br/><p>Ever since she had stepped into the Jing\u2019an Estate and all the way till the midday meal had ended, she had felt that the current House Jing\u2019an couldn\u2019t be compared to its former self from twenty years past.</p><br/><p>In these twenty years, House Jing\u2019an had already made its footing in the capital.</p><br/><p>The corners of her mouth tilted upwards in a smile, deepening the wrinkles around her lips and making her look even more harsh.</p><br/><p>As she turned around, her gaze landed upon a half-open window.</p><br/><p>This corridor ran parallel to Qingxi Hall\u2019s little study.</p><br/><p>The study was originally where Matriarch He took care of the household matters. However, after the old Count had passed away, Matriarch He had moved her own study into the old Count\u2019s study in the outer court instead, to remember her husband, leaving the little study empty. Now it was used by the trusted servants in Qingxi Hall for their work.</p><br/><p>Through the half-open window, she could see the matriarch\u2019s most trusted handmaid, Muxiang, seated at a desk with an abacus.</p><br/><p>Eldest Madam He Ying thought for a moment before walking over.</p><br/><p>The study was quiet and there was only a maidservant watching the door. However, the maidservant had already dozed off in front of a brazier, so He Ying was able to sneak into the study.</p><br/><p>Muxiang was staring at the account books and working diligently. The clacking of the abacus beads hid the sounds of the footsteps behind her.</p><br/><p>He Ying looked over at the account books that Muxiang was working on from a meter or two away. Her eyes widened and she sucked in a breath.</p><br/><p>What kind of storefront was that? How was it able to earn so much money?! It was bringing in more than three thousand taels of income a month!</p><br/><p>Her gaze quickly darted up to the start of the entries, only to see two words printed at the top: Guilin Restaurant.</p><br/><p>Guilin Restaurant?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that part of her mother\u2019s dowry?</p><br/><p>Even at its peak, it had only been one of the oldest restaurants in the capital at most without anything special to it. How had it suddenly become a money tree?</p><br/><p>Three thousand taels! That wasn\u2019t a small sum. Most noble ladies wouldn\u2019t even be given that amount in their dowries when they married. This Guilin Restaurant was bringing in three thousand taels of pure profit each month!</p><br/><p>Back then, when Matriarch He had sent her away to Siyang, she had only been given ten thousand taels of silver.</p><br/><p>He Ying\u2019s eyes lit up instantly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

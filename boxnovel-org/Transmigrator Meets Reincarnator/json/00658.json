The dim yellow candle light shone on the side of her face, making her small face seem even paler.</p><br/><p>As Wenqing didn\u2019t hear any reply from Chu Lian, she had to probe again, \u201cThird Young Madam, what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sighed softly, \u201cWenqing, take him to the opposite room, and have Wenlan get him a clean set of clothes. Okay, I\u2019m going to sleep now, don\u2019t disturb me unless it\u2019s for something important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing felt a burst of joy inside. Although the majority of the blame for the couple\u2019s fight fell upon Third Young Master this time and she wanted to get justice for Third Young Madam as well, the men were still the ones who held power in the Great Wu Dynasty.</p><br/><p>If the relationship between husband and wife deteriorated, Chu Lian would always be on the losing side as the wife.</p><br/><p>Wenqing personally went out and conveyed Chu Lian\u2019s words to Third Young Master.</p><br/><p>This time, He Changdi managed to enter the courtyard smoothly, and changed into clean, dry clothes in the room beside Chu Lian\u2019s.</p><br/><p>He wanted to go take a look at Chu Lian, but Wenlan informed him that Third Young Madam had already gone to sleep.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the lights were still on in Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>A maidservant was standing beside her and softly reporting something to her.</p><br/><p>Once she heard all of it, Royal Princess Duanjia pouted, and gestured for the maid to leave.</p><br/><p>When she was the only one left inside the room, a tall and burly figure appeared from behind a screen.</p><br/><p>He Changjue walked over to the table and sat down, \u201cThird Brother and Third Sister-in-law have always had a good relationship, why are they suddenly fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia rolled her eyes without any care for her image, \u201cHonestly, your brother\u2019s heart is like a blob of corniness. Getting soaked in the rain? He obviously did that on purpose! That silly Chu Liu would probably let everything go after he coaxes her a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changjue awkwardly coughed, \u201cSanlang isn\u2019t as bad as you think, he just really loves his wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit! Who even shows their love for their wife like this? And is he blind or something? He\u2019s been so close to that damned brat Leyao.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changjue stiffened up as he was unable to refute that.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia suddenly turned her head and glared at He Changjue, then pointed her finger right in his face, \u201cIf you dare to treat me like this in the future, I\u2019ll immediately divorce you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changjue\u2019s face immediately turned black.</p><br/><p>The next day, everyone was preparing to return to the capital early in the morning.</p><br/><p>As He Changdi had to stay by the emperor\u2019s side as a guard, he had already gotten up before dawn.</p><br/><p>Before he left, he stood in front of Chu Lian\u2019s window for fifteen minutes, and finally left while suppressing his coughs.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian got up, He Changdi was already long gone.</p><br/><p>She endured the urge to ask about He Changdi\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>However, her complexion seemed to have greatly improved after a proper night\u2019s rest.</p><br/><p>Once everything was packed, they boarded the carriage. Only an hour through the journey back to the capital, someone knocked on the window of the carriage.</p><br/><p>Wenlan raised the curtain of the carriage. Seeing the person outside the carriage, she greeted, \u201cGood morning, General Sima. Have you come to look for our Third Young Madam?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui was riding on a snow-white horse. Looking incredibly suave in her martial attire, she nodded towards Wenlan with a smile.</p><br/><p>A few moments later, Wenqing and Wenlan stepped off the carriage and got onto horses instead, leaving the space in the carriage for Chu Lian and Sima Hui.</p><br/><p>The moment Sima Hui entered the carriage, she looked around the spacious carriage and touched the decor in the carriage. A smile surfaced on her lips as she said, \u201cAs expected of the imperial family\u2019s carriage. If I hadn\u2019t known beforehand, I would have thought that the person riding in this carriage was a prince or princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gave her a look of disdain, \u201cThis is a carriage granted by the emperor himself, of course it would be high-quality.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong! The one that Xiao Bojian is riding in isn\u2019t as good as this one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Hui, have you come here just to make fun of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll stop joking with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Sima Hui\u2019s serious expression, Chu Lian set aside the smile on her face. With clear eyes and a slight frown, she asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Hui sat right next to her, and coughed twice awkwardly, \u201cLian\u2019er, just what happened between you and He Sanlang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026</p><br/><p>Right now, Chu Lian truly wished that she could find a hole and bury her head inside it. Why was it that this insignificant matter between her and her husband was known to everyone around them?</p><br/><p>After coming to her tent to for a free meal on the first day, Sima Hui had stayed by the emperor\u2019s side with the other military officials. The two hadn\u2019t even seen each other until now, yet Sima Hui had still caught wind of this.</p><br/><p>The corner of Chu Lian\u2019s mouth twitched. Only one possibility came to mind, \u201cWas it Fourth Prince who told you about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Jin was the lunatic He Changdi\u2019s best friend. If he needed to confide in someone about this, Prince Jin would be his first choice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

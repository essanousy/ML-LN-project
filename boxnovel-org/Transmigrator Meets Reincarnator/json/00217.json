Her fair skin and shapely nose were framed by the slight flush on her cheeks; her pink lips were parted slightly in her sleep.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian wasn\u2019t an unmatched beauty by any means, but she looked lovely and innocent when she was deep in sleep like this, like a little creature that needed protecting.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Bojian greedily devoured the enchanting scene with his eyes, he slowly bent down and reached out with his elegant fingers to touch the beauty before him.</p><br/><p>Right before his fingers were about to touch Chu Lian\u2019s soft cheeks, he curled his fingers back and retreated. In the end, he had to muster up all the reason he had to hold back from touching her face. However, he didn\u2019t pull his hand back; his fingers twitched slightly before tracing the curve of Chu Lian\u2019s profile.</p><br/><p>His finger glided over that lovely raised nose and passed over those parted petal-like lips, before sliding along the distinguished line of her chin and reaching her collarbones.</p><br/><p>His eyes followed the lines of her collarbones and went even further down, seemingly out of his control.</p><br/><p>The collar of her dress was made up of two lotus flowers and there was a light yellow piece of fabric peeking out from in between. The fabric below her collar was held up by the curves of her figure underneath\u2026 And even further down was her light green skirt. A cute little pair of shoes were exposed under the skirt.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s eyes turned a little bloodshot and his breathing became heavier.</p><br/><p>He forced himself to pull his hand back and shifted his eyes back to Chu Lian\u2019s pretty little face instead.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had been in the middle of a very comfortable nap. However, she suddenly felt a slight chill at her side, as if some danger had approached her body. Her brows drew together unconsciously and her mouth moved in her sleep. The tip of her tongue reached out a little from her mouth and glided along her pink lips.</p><br/><p>The originally innocent-looking girl had suddenly turned a little more seductive and charming thanks to this unconscious action.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shifted in her sleep and pulled out the arm that had been under her head, turning to one side instead and gathering her arms together.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian had frozen to the spot when he noticed Chu Lian moving. when he realised that she hadn\u2019t woken up, he relaxed and let out a small sigh. However, as he watched her change poses, the primal urges that he had been suppressing surged up again, seemingly about to overwhelm his rational mind at any moment.</p><br/><p>Due to her movement, Chu Lian\u2019s collar had parted, and that light yellow fabric underneath was even more visible now. Furthermore, her new sideways pose meant that more of the fair white skin underneath her collar was now exposed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s mind had been blown apart by this scene. His restraint and reason vanished in the space of a second and he suddenly bent down, hands grabbing on the armrests of the sandalwood chair.</p><br/><p>To hell with patience and self-control! Lian\u2019er should have been his! If not for that Empress Dowager\u2019s decree, how could he have lost Lian\u2019er to House Jing\u2019an? How could she have become He Changdi\u2019s wife?</p><br/><p>He Changdi was at the northern border now, so who knew if he would even be able to return? Once he gathered enough power, he was going to erase He Changdi from the earth, without even a grave to mark his existence!</p><br/><p>While these hateful and painful thoughts passed through his mind, Xiao Bojian was already face to face with Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Up close, Chu Lian\u2019s skin looked even more soft and tender, like the skin of a fresh peach.</p><br/><p>The warmth of her breath tickled his face. With eyes as deep as the ocean, he took in every little expression of hers with greedy eyes. Finally, he lowered his head and met the moist, pink lips before him with his own.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Since Prince Wei was present, they even had to leave the very last piece for him.</p><br/><p>This was the young prince\u2019s own home, so the maidservants were watching their masters attentively. When the young prince gave two light coughs, one of them hastily bent down to ask for his orders.</p><br/><p>Lu Tai whispered, \u201cWhy are you so tactless? Can\u2019t you see that the plates on the table are empty?\u201d</p><br/><p>The maidservant had a troubled expression on her face after hearing his question. She explained, \u201cYoung Prince, Honoured Lady and Royal Princess only made two roast ducks. We\u2019ve already served everything here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What?!</p><br/><p>They had gone to the trouble of specially cooking this food, yet they had only made so little of it. It wasn\u2019t even enough to feed a child.</p><br/><p>Lu Tai really wanted to stomp around in a fit of childish temper. He definitely had to enlighten his sister later.</p><br/><p>Since there wasn\u2019t any roast duck left, all Lu Tai could do was to wave his hand and dismiss the maidservant.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help looking over at his mother\u2019s table. After that one glance, jealousy flared up within him.</p><br/><p>The mouths of the three ladies were all oily from eating. Both plates were still half full.</p><br/><p>If father wasn\u2019t here, he would definitely have gone over to sit at his mother\u2019s table shamelessly for more roast duck.</p><br/><p>Princess Wei usually avoided eating rich foods, but Chu Lian\u2019s roast duck was different. It was fat, yet not greasy. It was also crispy and tender. She just couldn\u2019t resist eating more of it and she had nothing but praise for Chu Lian\u2019s roast duck.</p><br/><p>Since the roast duck was gone, the men at the other table all regained their composure.</p><br/><p>Prince Wei took a sip from the wine cup in front of him and said, \u201cI really liked the roast duck that Jinyi made. Do come to visit more often in the future, child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian promptly got up and bobbed in agreement after hearing his words.</p><br/><p>Prince Wei continued speaking, but this time, his words were directed at Xiao Bojian and He Changjue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prince has heard that the two of you are currently seeking a wife. Have you found someone suitable yet? Although this prince doesn\u2019t interfere with politics, I still have some connections within the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian was surprised that Prince Wei would ask about this. His first instinct wasn\u2019t to answer Prince Wei, but to dart a sideways glance at Chu Lian instead. There was a persistent gloom remaining on his face, as if the thought of a major life event like marriage still wasn\u2019t enough to lift his spirits.</p><br/><p>He secretly clenched his fists to control his emotions before respectfully answering Prince Wei, \u201cIn response to Your Highness, I\u2019m currently seeking a wife. This junior doesn\u2019t have any blood-related relatives left in this world, so my teacher has been helping me with this matter. It\u2019s just that there hasn\u2019t been any progress so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could there be no progress so far? Xiao Bojian was just lying openly. Old Duke Ying had already mentioned his intention to have him marry his legitimate granddaughter several times. It was just that Xiao Bojian hadn\u2019t agreed to it yet.</p><br/><p>After hearing his response, Prince Wei said, \u201cSince Old Duke Ying will handle this matter, then there is no need for this prince to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he looked towards He Changjue with an obvious meaning.</p><br/><p>The tips of He Erlang\u2019s ears instantly reddened, \u201cReplying to Your Highness, my grandmother hasn\u2019t found a suitable person yet, but this junior already has someone in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh?</p><br/><p>Prince Wei lifted a brow since he wasn\u2019t expecting this answer from He Changjue. Was the die-hard bachelor of the capital finally awakening to love?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s so, this prince will be the first to wish you all the best for your marriage. If you run into any problems, come look for me. This prince will help you.\u201d Prince Wei rarely interfered with the affairs of the noble families in the capital. It was a great surprise that he would be willing to help out with He Changjue\u2019s marriage. From this, it could be seen that Prince Wei was really fond of He Erlang.</p><br/><p>He Changjue was pleasantly surprised after hearing this. He immediately stood up to bow in gratitude without thinking about where he was, \u201cThank you, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Wei kindly waved his hand, unaware that he had sold his precious daughter with just a few sentences.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

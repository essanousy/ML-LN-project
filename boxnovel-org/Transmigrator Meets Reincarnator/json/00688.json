Wenlan had gone to the tea garden and it would take a few days for her to return to the estate.</p><br/><p>Since Xiyan wasn\u2019t feeling well in the morning, they could only find a replacement for her.</p><br/><p>There were only Xiyan, Wenqing, Wenlan and Muxiang serving Chu Lian as her four personal handmaids.</p><br/><p>The only one most suitable to take Xiyan\u2019s place was Muxiang.</p><br/><p>Ever since Chu Lian had gotten pregnant and Muxiang had been sent here to serve her by the matriarch, Muxiang had been behaving properly over the past few months. Furthermore, she worked swiftly, and got along well with the other maidservants.</p><br/><p>Even Wenqing, Wenlan and Xiyan had stopped guarding against her.</p><br/><p>Senior Servants Gui and Zhong were both troubled. The two senior servants were still reluctant to bring Muxiang along. Since they would be travelling out of the estate, they would have to take care of their madam the whole way. As amiable as Muxiang was, she had only been serving for a few months and she was still considered one of Matriarch He\u2019s servants. The two of them hadn\u2019t forgotten how Matriarch He had been biased against Chu Lian when they had moved out of the Jing\u2019an Estate!</p><br/><p>Compared to Muxiang, the two senior servants trusted the second-tier maidservant Baicha more.</p><br/><p>Just as Senior Servant Zhong was about to speak, Muxiang stepped up.</p><br/><p>She bobbed naturally to Chu Lian, a trace of worry showing in her expression, \u201cSince Xiyan isn\u2019t well, please let this servant serve Madam today.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian heard that the sick Xiyan had seemingly relaxed upon hearing Muxiang \u2018bravely\u2019 volunteer as her replacement, she bowed her head and pretended to think about it for a long moment. Finally, she said, \u201cFine, you can come along today. Baicha, take care of Xiyan. Get Uncle Miao here to take a look at her. Why did she suddenly fall ill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baicha immediately replied in the affirmative and turned to stride towards Xiyan\u2019s room, where the ill maidservant was resting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s getting late. Hurry up and pack these up. When my husband is back from court, we\u2019ll move out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was helped over to a wooden chair in the outer room by Wenqing. Senior Servant Zhong came out along with them.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glanced over at the senior servant. When she caught sight of the hesitant expression on Senior Servant Zhong, she asked, \u201c<i>Momo</i>, is there anything you wish to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong was startled by the question, \u201cMadam, this servant is afraid it won\u2019t be too good to let Muxiang go with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had guessed that she would say that. She patted the elderly servant\u2019s hand to reassure her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Even if she has any bad intentions, she\u2019s just one person. With my husband nearby, what can she do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since her master had already said so, Senior Servant Zhong kept the rest of her worries to herself.</p><br/><p>She sighed inwardly. There were some things that Chu Lian still wasn\u2019t cautious enough about.</p><br/><p>Actually, she found it rather strange. Chu Lian was normally quite prudent and treasured her life very much. Why would she suddenly act so carelessly?</p><br/><p>She was carrying two lives now. Even if Muxiang was a weak maidservant, if she really wanted to do anything bad, she might be able to\u2026</p><br/><p>Perhaps the pregnancy had affected her master\u2019s brain? Made her more foolish?</p><br/><p>That didn\u2019t seem right. Just two days ago, Zhou Wen and Manager Qin had been singing Madam\u2019s praises in her ear for her marvellous ideas for the northern market and Dejufeng.</p><br/><p>Senior Servant Zhong had no choice but to turn back inside and order Wenqing to watch Muxiang carefully.</p><br/><p>While Wenqing felt that there wasn\u2019t any need to, she still agreed.</p><br/><p>Once He Changdi returned from court, he changed into a comfortable set of robes and accompanied Chu Lian out.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an was already waiting in the outer court of the Anyuan Estate. When they neared the entrance of their estate, He Changdi personally helped Chu Lian into the carriage.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian and Wenqing were to share a carriage with Countess Jing\u2019an, while Muxiang and Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s handmaid, as well as a female doctor she had brought along, were to share another carriage. He Changdi would be mounted on his horse and lead the guards protecting both sides of the carriage.</p><br/><p>However, as they were travelling on the roads and before they had even reached the foot of Mount Lanxiang, a fast horse came chasing after them from behind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

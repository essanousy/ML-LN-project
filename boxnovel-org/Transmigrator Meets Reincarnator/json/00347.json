When he caught sight of Wenqing from the corner of his eyes, the hopes that he had been harbouring secretly in his heart were dashed.</p><br/><p>By the time Wenqing finished bobbing in greeting to her young master, all that greeted her in return was her young master\u2019s icy voice, \u201cWhat have you come here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing was afraid that Third Young Master would mistake her intentions, so she quickly explained, \u201cThird Young Master, this servant has come under Third Young Madam\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s stiff expression relaxed a little upon hearing this. He shifted awkwardly on the spot before giving his best shot at feigning a casual tone, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Wenqing wanted to laugh, how could she possibly dare to do so?</p><br/><p>She presented the package to He Changdi with both hands, \u201cThird Young Master, Third Young Madam asks for you to return to camp quickly. These are some things that she had this servant prepare for you. Third Young Madam was afraid that you wouldn\u2019t have enough clothes to wear since you gave away your clothes today, so she had these two sets of new clothes prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>As He Changdi took the package from Wenqing, his expression grew a little warmer. He hesitated for a moment, but he couldn\u2019t resist asking in the end, \u201cIs your young madam still angry with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wenqing heard her master actually asking something like this, she took the chance to say, \u201cThird Young Master, this servant has been serving by Third Young Madam\u2019s side for some time now, so this servant understands Third Young Madam\u2019s personality a little. Third Young Madam has always been friendly and easygoing, even with us lowly servants. She always meets everyone with a smile on her face. This servant has seen how much Third Young Madam has suffered on the way here to the northern border, so this servant hopes that Third Young Master might try to understand Third Young Madam\u2019s plight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing\u2019s words made the regret in He Sanlang\u2019s heart grow even deeper. He pressed his lips together without speaking for a long moment. He finally said, \u201cGo back and take good care of your young madam. Although her ankle is almost healed, she can\u2019t be careless with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though He Changdi\u2019s voice was still the same, his tone had changed to a much warmer and gentler one. Wenqing knew that her persuasion had worked. She agreed with a lighter heart, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, Third Young Master, this servant will take good care of Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang hooked his arm through the handle of the package and slung it onto his back. He mounted his horse and led his subordinates away from the He Estate and back to camp.</p><br/><p>If Chu Lian were to find out that Wenqing had explained the situation like that to He Sanlang, she would surely award her maidservant with a huge eyeroll.</p><br/><p>To be honest, on the whole journey here to the north, she really hadn\u2019t suffered much at all, excluding that sneak attack by the barbarians and Tuhuns. She had made enough preparations and Tang Yan was a capable man. They hadn\u2019t lacked for anything on the way here. Although they had travelled as fast as they could, it couldn\u2019t be compared to the harsh pace that army reinforcements had to travel at.</p><br/><p>She even had the free time to order Wenqing and Wenlan to cook something appetising each time they had stopped for a break. All she had done on the journey here was to eat and look at the pretty scenery. It was much better than some budget backpacking trips back in the modern world.</p><br/><p>After urging his horse on with his whip, He Changdi finally managed to return to the main camp before the sun set.</p><br/><p>Once he reached his tent, he saw that a bunch of his good friends were all waiting for him within.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai was met with He Changdi\u2019s terrible expression the moment he lifted the curtain flap and entered the tent. The corner of his lips curled up and he tsked, \u201cAy, we single bastards just don\u2019t get the same level of treatment as these happily married fools.\u201d</p><br/><p>He slapped Xiao Hongyu\u2019s shoulder as the poor lad was still searching around He Changdi\u2019s bed, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. What are you still searching for? Those lewd drawings of yours are probably ash in the brazier by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu immediately let out an anguished wail and collapsed onto He Changdi\u2019s soft bed. \u201cBrother He, Sister-in-Law couldn\u2019t possibly have found that book, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang had completely lost all of his dignity as a man in front of Chu Lian today. When Xiao Hongyu fearlessly reminded him of the incident, he sneered sinisterly.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s Note:</p><br/><p>Snow Mountain Mists: Sanlang, you can\u2019t go on like this! Come here, mommy will teach you how to make your wife happy!</p><br/><p>He Sanlang (with a terrible expression): Heh heh!</p><br/><p>Snow Mountain Mists: You brat, you have to work harder. You\u2019re still a virgin even now! \u03b5(\u252c\u252c\ufe4f\u252c\u252c)3</p><br/><p>He Sanlang: \u2026\u2026 (draws sword)</p><br/><p>Snow Mountain Mists: \u2026\u2026\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She quickly stopped the maid and said, \u201cPrincess, this dessert doesn\u2019t go along with sencha; it\u2019ll spoil the taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the princess lost her usual noble bearing as she rolled her eyes at Chu Lian. \u201cChu Liu, you\u2019re just saying that because you don\u2019t like to drink sencha, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>From the shine of Chu Lian\u2019s eyes, she could see that she was just trying to make up an excuse.</p><br/><p>The corner of Chu Lian\u2019s mouth twitched speechlessly; this princess was way too clever.</p><br/><p>Princess Duanjia\u2019s personal maidservant laughed in response. \u201cThird Young Madam, please be at ease. Our princess doesn\u2019t like sencha either. This servant will be pouring honey water, not sencha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sheepishly chuckled. How awkward.</p><br/><p>Princess Duanjia picked up a matcha-flavored cookie and asked curiously, \u201cChu Liu, can you tell me how you made this \u2018cookie\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inwardly, Princess Duanjia was thinking to herself, \u2018Chu Liu must have come up with the name herself. It\u2019s so weird, and so inelegant. Hmph, all she knows how to do is eat!\u2019</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was quite surprised. In the past few days, she had made quite a number of delicacies which exceeded the current standards of the Great Wu Dynasty. Although every dish she made had received tremendous praise, since the people here guarded their secret recipes even more preciously than their own lives, no one had ever straight out asked her for the recipe. That is, until she met Princess Duanjia!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t quite know how to react for a moment. \u201cPrincess, do you really want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, do you think I\u2019m kidding!?\u201d Princess Duanjia rolled her eyes at her again.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s eyes were wide open by now, and her thick eyelashes trembled as she blinked. \u201cSince you\u2019re that curious about how the cookies were made\u2026 Well, it\u2019s hard to say. It could be hard for some and easy for others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen make it easy for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian almost choked. All she could do was gather up her patience and begin to recite the instructions. \u201cTo make these cookies, you\u2019ll need butter, eggs, flour, and sugar. Prepare all these ingredients first, then mix the butter, add in the sugar, throw in the beaten eggs, and stir the mixture. After mixing them thoroughly, add the flour and stir. Shape the dough as you like, then just bake it. However, it won\u2019t be easy for most people to grasp how to mix and bake it properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian made it sound simple, it was practically impossible for the people of this era to make a proper cookie without experience. They would probably be in over their heads just trying to deal with the butter alone. The recipe was only simple to Chu Lian; it was a completely different matter for other people.</p><br/><p>Princess Duanjia frowned. \u201cSo that means\u2026 for most people, it\u2019ll be very hard to bake this cookie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded. \u201cPrincess, something like this cute matcha cookie you\u2019re holding will require even more steps to make. If you want to try making some, you could learn how to make a simple cookie first, without making any special shapes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! I want to make one shaped like a cat\u2019s head, and it has to be matcha-flavoured!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Chu Lian\u2019s suffering showed a little in her expression, but without waiting for her to gather her thoughts, Princess Duanjia spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring more cookies the next time you come over! Remember, they must be shaped like cat heads, and they have to be as cute as this one! I won\u2019t let you go if they\u2019re not cute!\u201d A little embarrassed by her own words, Princess Duanjia pouted. Her awkward expression was rather endearing.</p><br/><p>Once again, Chu Lian replied with a stupefied, \u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>After some thought, she realised that she had been invited by the princess again.</p><br/><p>She suddenly thought that Princess Duanjia\u2019s awkward expression was actually pretty adorable.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll bring some other flavours next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Duanjia\u2019s eyes lit up, but she immediately followed it up with a pout. \u201cWho wants you to come? I just want to eat more of these cute cat-shaped snacks.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

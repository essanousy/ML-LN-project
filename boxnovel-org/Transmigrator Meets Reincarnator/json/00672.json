When he had left the estate at noon, Chu Lian had already been sitting there.</p><br/><p>It was indeed rather cool under the grape vines here. Since it was close to an alley, a breeze would pass by from time to time and the dense grape vines absorbed much of the harsh sunlight. It might even be comfier than a modern air-conditioned room.</p><br/><p>Xiyan and Wenlan had already asked a few times, but Chu Lian didn\u2019t want to move at all.</p><br/><p>Although it was summer now, it wasn\u2019t good for a pregnant woman to sit in the breeze for too long.</p><br/><p>However, the group of maidservants couldn\u2019t get Chu Lian to budge. She had already started flipping through the account books that Manager Qin had just delivered.</p><br/><p>The moment He Changdi entered the courtyard, he was greeted with the sight of the maidservants standing helplessly next to Chu Lian, looking like they wanted to speak but not daring to at all.</p><br/><p>When Xiyan noticed He Changdi, her eyes lit up, as if she had just seen her saviour.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was currently sitting with her back facing He Changdi, so she couldn\u2019t see him at all. He Changdi waved his hand at Xiyan and Wenlan to dismiss them.</p><br/><p>The two handmaids bobbed in respect before leading the other maidservants away.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was still marvelling at the speedy development of the market and was immersed in the numbers on the pages with wide eyes. All of a sudden, she was pulled up from behind and into someone\u2019s embrace, giving her a fright.</p><br/><p>She only had time to make a short scream before her mouth was devoured by a familiar pair of lips.</p><br/><p>Her eyes went even wider, and she finally looked right into the dark eyes of her husband. Chu Lian was so angry that she beat on He Changdi\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>He Changdi let her struggle, but he made sure to keep her stable in his embrace. He kept one hand over her waist to make sure she wouldn\u2019t kick her own belly.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he refused to give in and played with her tongue mercilessly.</p><br/><p>It only took a few punches before Chu Lian gave up on moving him. His chest was all hard and it seemed like it didn\u2019t even affect him. In the end, all she was doing was making her hands sore.</p><br/><p>The flurry of movement and the battle between their tongues sapped her strength away, making her boneless.</p><br/><p>She could only let this lunatic husband of hers do as he liked.</p><br/><p>When He Changdi finally let go of her tongue, they were already back in their own room.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s face was fully flushed. The parts of her neck exposed to the air were also pink. Pregnant women were more sensitive than most. Right now, her eyes were slightly watery, giving her a tender and beguiling aura, seducing the person beholding her beauty.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s pupils dilated and he took a gulp. All the blood in his body rushed downwards\u2026</p><br/><p>He sat Chu Lian down on the chaise, while he took a few steps back to put some distance between them. He tugged at his robes awkwardly.</p><br/><p>He reprimanded her in a cool voice, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to sit in the breeze for more than two hours from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian simply stared at him, tongue-tied. Was he going to nitpick even over this?</p><br/><p>He was going to become a busybody soon\u2026</p><br/><p>There was the hint of a pout in her voice as she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s hot in the room.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi looked around the room and retrieved a hand fan from the side. He opened it up and started fanning her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it still hot now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t know how to reply to that. A twitch developed in the corner of her mouth, and she tried to push away He Changdi, who was starting to lean closer and closer to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come back so early today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go to the ministry today. I was at Prince Jin\u2019s estate, so I came home earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi couldn\u2019t resist hugging Chu Lian again. Her figure was already small in the first place. Even though she was now more than three months pregnant, she hadn\u2019t gotten any bigger yet. Only the smooth glow of her skin and her extra sensitivity hinted that there was a new life growing inside her.</p><br/><p>His arm slid under her slender neck and he continued fanning her. The cool breeze washed over her flushed cheeks and neck, carrying the slight fragrance of her body to his nose, immediately tempting the desire he had suppressed for months.</p><br/><p>The thought of the silver mine that had been taken away by the emperor suddenly came to Chu Lian\u2019s mind. A wrinkle appeared between her brows and she turned to catch He Changdi\u2019s collar, looking up at him. She was about to tell him about the northern market when He Changdi bent down to catch her lips once again.</p><br/><p>He licked her cherry red lips before nibbling on her full lower lip. Finally, his agile tongue slid into her sweet, warm cavern and immediately overpowered her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gave in to the desire that his actions had stirred. Even if she tried to push him, it had no effect, so she could only wrap her arms around his waist and continuously stroke the area there.</p><br/><p>For such a tall and strong man, He Changdi\u2019s most sensitive area was actually his waist. However, even Chu Lian didn\u2019t know that\u2026</p><br/><p>In the middle of playing with Chu Lian\u2019s tongue, He Sanlang suddenly frowned and let out a suppressed moan.</p><br/><p>Even if it was a man\u2019s voice, that moan was very seductive.</p><br/><p>Before Chu Lian could react, he threw away the fan in his hands and pulled Chu Lian onto his lap. His other hand caught both of Chu Lian\u2019s naughty hands and restrained them.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quivered a little at the sudden movement, her half-lidded eyes immediately fluttering open. Being held down like this made her shy and timid. She turned her head away because she couldn\u2019t meet his eyes in this state.</p><br/><p>However, there was still a buff arm wrapped around her, so she couldn\u2019t get away totally.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Changdi, let go of me!\u201d She panted coquettishly in protest.</p><br/><p>Right now, her entire body was in his arms. How could He Changdi bear to let go of his lovely wife at this point?</p><br/><p>A man who had been left high and dry for two months was to be feared, especially when it was the lunatic He Changdi.</p><br/><p>He tightened his embrace around Chu Lian and panted into her ear. The hot and heavy breaths puffing over her ears made them flush instantly.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian could hear his husky voice pleading, like a big puppy begging for help, \u201cLian\u2019er\u2026 Help me, please?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Eunuch Wei didn\u2019t dare to disobey orders, so he obediently went on his way, despite his troubled expression.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was in the middle of eating her second mini mooncake when she heard Eunuch Sun greeting someone.</p><br/><p>Curious, Chu Lian turned around, only to see that there was now another middle-aged eunuch standing behind her, holding a horsetail whisk in his arms.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Sun smiled as he introduced the newly arrived eunuch to Chu Lian. \u201cHonoured Lady, this is the chief steward of the imperial palace, Eunuch Wei. He serves by the Emperor\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled and nodded, greeting him cheerfully with a \u2018Chief Steward Wei\u2019.</p><br/><p>Chief Steward Wei bowed towards Chu Lian respectfully. His eyes swept over the purse she was holding in her hands, and upon seeing its quickly depleting state, he couldn\u2019t help but inwardly beg: \u2018My dear ancestor, please eat a little slower- the Emperor\u2019s still waiting for those snacks!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHonoured Lady really knows how to enjoy life. This Mixiang Pavilion is the best place to admire flowers in the entire imperial gardens. Just a few days ago, the Empress Dowager even mentioned that the best thing to do during the middle of autumn is admire the chrysanthemums while enjoying some round cakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian found this whole meeting rather strange. This Eunuch Wei should be a very busy person, judging from his job title. How could he have the spare time to stand here and make small talk with her?</p><br/><p>When she saw that Eunuch Wei seemed to want to continue chatting, Chu Lian could only play along. \u201cChief Steward Wei, you\u2019re overestimating me. I just happened to be passing by and stopped to eat a few snacks since I was feeling hungry.\u201d Chu Lian looked down at the snack purse she was holding and continued, \u201cThese aren\u2019t round cakes, by the way. They\u2019re just some snacks I made for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? This servant has long heard that Honoured Lady\u2019s heart is as good and pure as an orchid. This servant didn\u2019t think that Honoured Lady would also know how to make her own confections. This servant wonders if there might be a chance to taste Honoured Lady\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p><br/><p>When those words left Eunuch Wei\u2019s mouth, even he couldn\u2019t hold back the slight, embarrassed flush on his cheeks. But no matter how awkward this was, he couldn\u2019t disobey the Emperor\u2019s orders!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was stunned. What? A high-ranked eunuch she had never met before- the chief steward of the palace, at that- was asking her for\u2026 her snacks?</p><br/><p>With Chu Lian\u2019s baffled gaze focused on him, Eunuch Wei awkwardly received the snack purse. Following that, he gave her a deep, low bow, and then\u2026 he ran off\u2026 at lightspeed\u2026</p><br/><p>Only Chu Lian was left standing in the pavilion, her hands still outstretched as she said to thin air, \u201cEunuch Wei\u2026 My purse\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Eunuch Wei was already long gone by now.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s expression was cloudy. She turned to ask the frozen Eunuch Sun, \u201cEunuch Sun, is the food in the palace that bad?\u201d Otherwise, why would the chief steward have stolen her snacks and run away?!</p><br/><p>The corners of Eunuch Sun\u2019s lips twitched. In the end, he could only let Honoured Lady Jinyi continue believing her own conclusions. After all, he worked under Eunuch Wei. How could he dare to cast suspicion on Eunuch Wei\u2019s conduct? Though, within the privacy of his mind, he was also severely perplexed by this series of events. Eunuch Wei was one of the Emperor\u2019s trusted servants: he could eat the best birds\u2019 nest and the best abalone every day if he wanted to. How could he have come to covet a young girl\u2019s snacks, and then just steal them away like that? Had the sun risen from the west today?</p><br/><p>But Eunuch Wei was already long gone, and it was just one small purse with a couple snacks in it. There was nothing special about it, so Chu Lian didn\u2019t pursue the matter further.</p><br/><p>She was about to rest for a moment longer before going over to the Empress Dowager\u2019s palace to look for Matriarch He, but Royal Princess Duanjia suddenly came striding over from not too far away.</p><br/><p>When Royal Princess Duanjia reached Chu Lian\u2019s side, she pulled her up without waiting for Chu Lian to give her a bow in greeting. \u201cI heard from the Empress Dowager that you were over here in the imperial gardens when I entered the palace, so I came over to find you. I didn\u2019t think I would bump into you at Mixiang Pavilion!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

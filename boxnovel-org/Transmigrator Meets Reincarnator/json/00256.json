Dalang\u2019s wife was afraid that the two little ones had lost favour with her and was trying to make sure that she wouldn\u2019t forget about the existence of the two young girls.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Madam Zou hadn\u2019t understood her kind intentions at all. Her heart was only filled with thoughts of fighting for favour.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He\u2019s earlier good mood completely dissipated.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as you like. Make sure that the servants keep a watch on the girls\u2019 health. The weather outside is so cold now, so make sure they put on more layers and bring a hand warmer with them when going out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGranddaughter-in-Law understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He picked up her teacup and took a sip before she said, \u201cIt\u2019s your mother\u2019s birthday tomorrow; how are the preparations going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, Grandmother. Granddaughter-in-Law has already ordered the servants to prepare everything. There won\u2019t be any accidents tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old woman is already getting on in age and your mother\u2019s health still isn\u2019t what it was. It\u2019s been hard on you all these years!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou almost cried out upon hearing these words of praise from Matriarch He. Wasn\u2019t it so? She was the only one managing this huge estate. How could it possibly be easy? She had to get up early in the morning before the sun rose and listen to the daily reports from all the stewards of the estate, arrange for servants where needed, and even had to mind the relationships between the people in the estate.</p><br/><p>It could be said that this great Jing\u2019an Estate wouldn\u2019t be able to function without her.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou felt even more aggrieved upon thinking about all this and sunk even further into her self-pity.</p><br/><p>Tears leaked out of her eyes, already beyond her control. \u201cAs long as Grandmother understands Granddaughter-in-Law\u2019s hardships, then this bit of labour is nothing to Granddaughter-in-Law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, stop crying, don\u2019t spoil your eyes by crying too much. If you have any hardships, you can tell Grandmother directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou was still choked up with tears as she looked up at Matriarch He with wet eyes. \u201cGrandmother, since you asked, Granddaughter-in-Law won\u2019t keep it from you anymore. Granddaughter-in-Law does have a matter to discuss with Grandmother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was slightly stunned. She hadn\u2019t expected that Madam Zou would really take her up on her offer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Just say it out directly. There\u2019s nothing you have to hide from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou hesitated before finally gathering the courage to speak. \u201cGrandmother, Mother\u2019s medical expenses\u2026 I\u2019m afraid our estate\u2019s public accounts can no longer afford them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A single month of Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s medicine cost at least a thousand taels. The monthly income for House Jing\u2019an\u2019s public accounts was merely one to two thousand taels. Furthermore, Madam Zou wasn\u2019t good at business management, and the managers of the stores and properties they had were appropriating funds for themselves. It was getting harder and harder to keep this noble estate afloat.</p><br/><p>Countess Jing\u2019an had previously paid for her own medicine, and her expenses had only shifted to the shared accounts just two months ago. After less than three months, the estate\u2019s funds were already dwindling.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He hadn\u2019t expected that their estate\u2019s funds would be exhausted so quickly. Her brows drew together in a frown and she was about to speak when a maidservant announced the arrival of Third Young Madam.</p><br/><p>Even though the matriarch had been interrupted, she wasn\u2019t angry at all. Instead, her expression turned cheerful. \u201cQuick, invite Sanlang\u2019s wife in. It\u2019s cold outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thick curtains covering the entrance of the heated room were pulled aside by the maidservant standing outside, and Chu Lian crouched slightly to enter the room.</p><br/><p>Since Chu Lian\u2019s noble title had been bestowed by the Chengping Emperor himself, she could be counted as part of the imperial family. Thus, the palace\u2019s Department of Textiles had sent Chu Lian two outfits when they prepared winter clothing for the imperial family.</p><br/><p>There was a lovely light vermillion court dress and a simpler teal dress with auspicious pictures embroidered over it. There were twelve pictures of flowers embroidered on each dress, and the design was both complicated and beautiful at the same time. This standard of craftsmanship was as expected from the department in charge of clothing the imperial family.</p><br/><p>Today, Chu Lian was wearing that bluish green dress with a flared skirt.</p><br/><p>Her slender hands were stuffed into a snow white sleeve made of rabbit fur. She only wore a single white jade hairpin on her head, and the rest of her black hair was left cascading down her back with some strands resting on the fluffy white fur collar of her dress. She looked like a cute, obedient little bunny in this getup. If not for the fact that her hair was done up in a married madam\u2019s hairstyle, one might think that she was a young noble maiden who had just come of age!</p><br/><p>\u201cGranddaughter-in-Law has come to greet Grandmother,\u201d Chu Lian cheerfully called out as she entered the room.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He felt happy just seeing Chu Lian\u2019s smooth as porcelain, doll-like face with a smile. \u201cWhat are you doing coming here so early on such a cold day! Come, sit next to Grandmother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian bobbed towards Madam Zou before sitting next to Matriarch He.</p><br/><p>The matriarch ordered Senior Servant Liu to give Chu Lian a cup of warm honey water. She knew her little granddaughter-in-law didn\u2019t like to drink sencha, unlike most people.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou watched coldly as Matriarch He unconsciously showed loving care and consideration for Chu Lian. The hands under her sleeves curled into fists.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou suppressed her jealousy and waited until Chu Lian had been given a warm cup of honey water. Only then did she say, \u201cGrandmother, about that matter that Granddaughter-in-Law mentioned earlier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Reminded of the pressing problem at hand by Madam Zou, Matriarch He\u2019s expression turned serious. \u201cIt was my fault for not considering this matter more carefully. However, I seem to remember that we should have at least three thousand taels of income from the shopfronts in our estate\u2019s accounts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Three thousand taels were more than enough to sustain the estate\u2019s monthly expenses, even after taking away Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s medicine fees.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou\u2019s lips parted, but she hesitated to speak. Finally, she used her remaining courage to say, \u201cGrandmother, that was the situation five years ago. It can\u2019t be compared to the situation now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zou suddenly shot a glance in Chu Lian\u2019s direction. When she saw that her sister-in-law had her head lowered and was drinking some honey water instead, a spark of dissatisfaction flashed through her heart. \u201cGranddaughter-in-Law doesn\u2019t have a single store in hand that can compare to Third Sister-in-Law\u2019s Guilin Restaurant.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

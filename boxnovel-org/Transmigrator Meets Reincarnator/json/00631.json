It was this humble official who didn\u2019t see clearly in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression on the Chengping Emperor\u2019s face turned even more sour upon receiving such a vague answer from He Changdi.</p><br/><p>He cast a cold glance over the young man behind him, obvious disappointment in his gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that Jinyi isn\u2019t good enough for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alarm spiked in He Changdi. He didn\u2019t understand why the emperor would have such thoughts.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang shook his head resolutely and said, \u201cThis humble official has never thought so.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor didn\u2019t continue his line of questioning, but he had already completed his evaluation of He Changdi as a man of ability.</p><br/><p>From the day of He Changdi and Chu Lian\u2019s wedding, to He Changdi\u2019s time in the northern border army, to the great victory over the Tuhuns, the emperor had sent out his spies to dig out all the details of their lives these past few days.</p><br/><p>There was no way to hide anything from the fearsome spy corps if they were determined to dig out all details.</p><br/><p>The letters Chu Lian had sent to He Changdi, the hint to join under Captain Guo\u2019s banner, the beef jerky and snacks, as well as the grape wine that Chu Lian had passed on to He Changdi via courier\u2026</p><br/><p>As well as the grape wine being the reason he had caught Great General Qian\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Following that, the spy corps had also reported about how Chu Lian had opened Guilin Restaurant and how she had found Great Doctor Miao in order to treat Countess Jing\u2019an\u2019s illness.</p><br/><p>In the most critical period, when there was no one available in the Jing\u2019an Estate, how Chu Lian had volunteered to go to the northern border herself to help He Changdi find the last important ingredient needed for the medicine: the Snow Mountain Mists flower.</p><br/><p>All the way down to the design of the snowboats and their making\u2026</p><br/><p>Listing down all of the incidents like this, Chu Lian had done many things behind the scenes for He Changdi. She had also somehow saved Royal Princess Duanjia and made friends with Prince Wei\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>Behind every part of He Changdi\u2019s success was Chu Lian\u2019s shadow.</p><br/><p>Perhaps He Changdi had only seen her value after Chu Lian had done so much, and finally acknowledged her position as his legitimate wife and consummated their marriage upon returning to the capital.</p><br/><p>That was how the emperor thought in his mind.</p><br/><p>It was also precisely because of all this information that the spy corps discovered the emperor\u2019s impression of He Changdi\u2019s person was\u2026 extremely bad.</p><br/><p>In the emperor\u2019s heart, He Changdi wasn\u2019t fit to be the husband of his and Ye Xun\u2019s precious daughter.</p><br/><p>The gaze he directed into the distance grew icier.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you think up the snowboats by yourself?\u201d He Sanlang heard the emperor ask coldly.</p><br/><p>He frowned and replied without any hesitation, \u201cReplying to Your Majesty, this humble official did not. It was this humble official\u2019s wife who came up with the snowboat\u2019s blueprints and the actual snowboats.\u201d</p><br/><p>Great General Qian had credited He Changdi as the creator of the snowboat in order to give him extra merits in his military report.</p><br/><p>Other than He Changdi, Chu Lian, and a few of her trusted subordinates, no one else knew that the snowboat had any relation to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Later on, Chu Lian had told He Changdi to take the snowboats to the northern border camp.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had wanted to keep a low profile, so she herself requested to keep the matter a secret.</p><br/><p>Thus, when Great General Qian reported the matter, all credit naturally fell onto He Changdi.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t care much about such minor details, and their relationship had already changed after that, so she didn\u2019t mind it at all.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this minor matter was completely different in the eyes of a doting and remorseful father.</p><br/><p>From the emperor\u2019s point of view, he thought that He Changdi had stolen Chu Lian\u2019s credit. He had even suspected that He Changdi had earned his title mostly through Chu Lian\u2019s own efforts.</p><br/><p>He had assumed that He Changdi wouldn\u2019t admit to the theft, but He Changdi had surprised him by admitting so readily that it had been Chu Lian who had come up with the snowboat.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s feelings were now slightly complicated.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t ask He Changdi anything else as they waited for the rest of the hunting party to catch up with them. Other than the sound of their horses\u2019 hoofbeats, silence surrounded them, making the atmosphere heavy.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was starting to realise that the emperor wasn\u2019t happy with him because of Chu Lian, but he couldn\u2019t guess at what the relation between the two of them was.</p><br/><p>They had set off so happily in the morning, but now that they were close to the imperial hunting grounds, everyone could sense the emperor\u2019s gloomy mood, especially the emperor\u2019s attendants and bodyguards. They didn\u2019t dare to make a sound, even when they were retrieving items from their saddlebags.</p><br/><p>They finally arrived at the hunting grounds, where tents had been set up for the hunting party.</p><br/><p>Since they were to spend the night on the grounds itself, there were already tents erected all over the area. Of course, the emperor\u2019s tent was the most eye-catching and luxurious.</p><br/><p>The princes\u2019 tents were placed around the emperor\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>Only Imperial Concubine Wei had been invited, out of the entire inner palace, so Imperial Concubine Wei and the princesses were situated behind the emperor\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>The next ring of tents belonged to the more influential officials, nobles, and military officials.</p><br/><p>House Anyuan\u2019s tent wasn\u2019t too far away from the center, nor too close to the edges. It had a good position somewhere in the middle of the entire party. There was also a natural pool not too far away.</p><br/><p>The water in the pool was crystal-clear and pure. They could drink straight out of the pool.</p><br/><p>Sima Hui\u2019s tent was right next to Chu Lian\u2019s, just twenty or so metres away.</p><br/><p>Since it was already 12 in the afternoon, when the emperor entered the hunting grounds, he headed straight to his tent to rest. The imperial cooks had already prepared a luxurious meal for the emperor.</p><br/><p>The rest of the hunting party dispersed to their own tents for some rest.</p><br/><p>The emperor would only bring everyone out to hunt later, closer to evening.</p><br/><p>There were still 4 hours until that time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

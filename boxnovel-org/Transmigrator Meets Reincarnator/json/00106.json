However, she still remembered to close her mouth to avoid making a faux-pas in the midst of a delicate situation. \u201cSince Father has returned, Daughter-in-Law will go to the main kitchen and instruct them to add more of Father\u2019s favourite dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lady Yang only managed to restrain herself until her daughter-in-law left. Afterwards, she burst out laughing. \u201cWas this sent by House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lord Yang nonchalantly nodded as he sipped his tea, keeping up his innocent pretense.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I blame you; that girl makes the most delicious food.\u201d After saying so, Lady Yang opened the box and picked up a pastry. The moment she tasted it, her eyes lit up. \u201cThat girl\u2026 What did she make this time? It fits my tastes even better than those longevity peach buns she made before. Mm, it\u2019s actually salty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lord Yang licked his lips. A salty pastry? What a pity he hadn\u2019t been able to taste it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were only eight pastries in this box. So it seems like each one has a different flavour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lady Yang was surprised. There were such finely made desserts?</p><br/><p>She quickly ate the very last one and confirmed that the two pastries she had eaten had completely different tastes. It was only after she was done eating that she picked up the smaller box at the side. When she saw that her coral bracelet was inside, the corners of Lady Yang\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s more to this girl from House Ying than just being more fertile.\u201d They finally had someone who had brains amongst them!</p><br/><p>Lady Yang immediately wrote a reply and sent one of the Yang Family\u2019s most trusted manservants to the Jing\u2019an Estate with the letter.</p><br/><p>Ever since Lord Yang had eaten the Eight Confections that Chu Lian had sent over, he had fallen in love with rose-flavoured desserts. He instructed the chefs in his estate to make some, but none of them could compare to the ones that Chu Lian had made that day, causing Lord Yang to become even pickier about his food. He even lost a few kilograms of weight after that! Of course, the birth of the gourmand Lord Yang was a later story.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The same return gift had been sent to Prince Wei\u2019s estate.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia opened up the brocade box without any hesitation. Her big eyes were shimmering when she saw the desserts within. In order to enjoy them all by herself, she carefully brought them back to her own courtyard. Not even her second brother received a single piece when he came over looking for snacks. Seeing his little sister acting like a puppy guarding her food, the royal prince was extremely amused.</p><br/><p>He immediately ran off to his mother\u2019s room to tattle on his sister. \u201cMother, Third Sister found something really delicious, but she\u2019s so stingy she wouldn\u2019t let me have a single bite!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Has she?\u201d Princess Wei raised an eyebrow. Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s personality was haughty and aloof, and it was rare to find something that could move her. Princess Wei found it interesting that something like food had managed to make her daughter act out of character.</p><br/><p>As mother and son were talking, Royal Princess Duanjia entered the room. \u201cBrother, how old are you? What are you doing snitching to Mother about me at your age!\u201d</p><br/><p>The royal prince sat next to Princess Wei and retorted, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to find out exactly what kind of food has bewitched my darling little sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia glared at the royal prince and moved to Princess Wei\u2019s other side. \u201cMother, in a few days, I want to invite someone to our estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Wei was sitting in the master\u2019s seat. Brimming with an aura of elegant luxury, a faint smile appeared on her lips. \u201cIs it the person who gave you those desserts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia smiled mysteriously. \u201cI\u2019m not telling Mother yet! Mother will know when she comes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Wei lovingly poked her only daughter\u2019s forehead. \u201cMother won\u2019t stop you from making friends, but don\u2019t forget your status.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Back in the Jing\u2019an Estate, the main steward in the outer court had already ordered a senior servant to bring over two letters to Songtao Court before dinner. One of the letters was even accompanied by a gift.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian received the letters and glanced at the contents within.</p><br/><p>One of the letters was from Lady Yang and the other was actually from Royal Princess Duanjia.</p><br/><p>Lady Yang had sent the coral bracelet back again, saying that it was a gift for her anyway, and that she couldn\u2019t possibly take it back. She also said to keep the bracelet properly, and if they met in the future, she could make a few more different kinds of pastries as gifts instead.</p><br/><p>Although Lady Yang didn\u2019t state outright if they were on visiting terms with each other, this was already a great concession for Chu Lian, and could be counted as a good connection.</p><br/><p>What Chu Lian had found strange was Royal Princess Duanjia\u2019s letter.</p><br/><p>Royal Princess Duanjia had actually invited her over to Prince Wei\u2019s estate for a small gathering.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

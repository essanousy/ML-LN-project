He headed to the study immediately after training. Laiyue met him there, so it seems like they have some business to take care of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian nodded. Since that was so, she didn\u2019t have to bother with He Changdi\u2019s whereabouts today. She went to the parlour for breakfast after getting ready.</p><br/><p>Wenlan followed behind Chu Lian. She tried to speak up several times, but she was stopped by Chu Lian\u2019s glare each time she did so. Finally, Wenlan could no longer hold back her question when Chu Lian was seated and eating breakfast alone at the table, \u201cThird Young Madam, should this servant go to the study and invite Third Young Master over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian lifted her head and blinked innocently. She pretended as if she didn\u2019t understand, \u201cWhat for? He\u2019s already a grown man, wouldn\u2019t he know when he\u2019s hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenlan didn\u2019t dare to say anything else after hearing Chu Lian\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian made short work of her breakfast. When she was done, she wiped her mouth with a handkerchief and rinsed her mouth. She immediately stood up and headed straight for her little study.</p><br/><p>Wenlan anxiously followed behind her. In the end, she shot a look at the junior maidservant behind her. The young maidservant quickly understood her meaning and hastily ran out towards the direction of He Changdi\u2019s study.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t hold back her grin any longer once she settled down in front of the desk of her little study.</p><br/><p>That He Sanlang was really useless. He clearly wanted to please her and make her happy, but he chose to do it in such a sneaky and covert manner. He couldn\u2019t set down his pride to face her this morning, so he had deliberately gotten up earlier.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t indulge this awkward tsundere personality of his. He deserved to suffer for his silly actions.</p><br/><p>In the main study of Songtao Court, He Sanlang sat ramrod straight in front of his desk with two stacks of official documents piled on top of the surface before him. His head was lowered and he was seemingly reading the document in his hands. Laiyue had been observing him the whole time while standing beside him.</p><br/><p>Uhhh\u2026 If he remembered it right, his young master had been staring at a blank page in that document for almost half an hour\u2026</p><br/><p>Is he really reading?</p><br/><p>When a sudden knock sounded on the door of the study, He Sanlang\u2019s deep gaze immediately turned towards the door.</p><br/><p>Laiyue rushed to the entrance to answer the knock A moment later, he shut the door and walked over to He Sanlang.</p><br/><p>Laiyue really wanted to kill himself. His luck was seriously terrible. Why did he have to come look for his master at this time today? He had come right when his master and his wife were in the middle of a quarrel.</p><br/><p>He asked in a trembling voice, \u201cThird Young Master, Third Young Madam is currently having breakfast. Would you like to go over?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s stomach growled right as Laiyue was speaking.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s expression froze up and his handsome face immediately turned as black as the bottom of a pot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour young madam didn\u2019t send any message over at all?\u201d He Sanlang gritted his teeth as he sought confirmation.</p><br/><p>Laiyue had a troubled expression on his face as he shook his head. Seeing how his master looked right now, Laiyue really wanted to turn into a quail and hide in a corner so that no one could see him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how is her appetite today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heh heh\u2026 Laiyue\u2019s eyes twitched. The maidservant who had come to report had told him that Third Young Madam seemed to be in a very good mood. She had even eaten an extra steamed pork dumpling\u2026</p><br/><p>In order to save his pitiful little life, it was probably better if he didn\u2019t mention that\u2026</p><br/><p>Laiyue continued to lower his head until it was almost buried into his chest.</p><br/><p>When He Changdi didn\u2019t receive any response after a long moment, his expression turned so dark that ink was about to seep out from his pores.</p><br/><p>The temperature inside the study instantly hit subzero. Laiyue felt like he was about to suffocate.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang continued sitting in front of his desk and sulked all by himself. After waiting for about an hour, someone else finally came over.</p><br/><p>Wenlan had personally come over this time.</p><br/><p>When Laiyue saw that their next guest wasn\u2019t Third Young Madam, he knew that the situation was bad. He went out to welcome Wenlan before she had even reached the entrance of the study.</p><br/><p>He pulled Wenlan over to the corridor outside the study. Laiyue was so anxious that his brows were creased together, \u201cWhere\u2019s Third Young Madam!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenlan pulled her arm away from Laiyue\u2019s grip and gave him a good glare before she replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s with all this tugging? Third Young Madam is in the little study.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue was on the verge of tears. Why wasn\u2019t Third Young Madam looking for Third Young Master at this time? Why had she gone over to the little study instead?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see that Third Young Master isn\u2019t happy? Hurry up and bring Third Young Madam over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenlan rolled her eyes, \u201cWhy do I have to invite Third Young Madam over? Third Young Madam has some business to do in the study. I can\u2019t disturb her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh, my dear ancestor, don\u2019t you know what time it is right now? Do you even want to continue living?! I\u2019m begging you, please! Please go and invite Third Young Madam here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Too lazy to bother with a response, Wenlan simple turned around to leave, but Laiyue blocked her way.</p><br/><p>Wenlan was getting a little angry, \u201cWhy do I have to bring Third Young Madam over? Third Young Madam didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It\u2019s not just Third Young Master who\u2019s busy. Can\u2019t our Third Young Madam be busy too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue was stunned. When had this brat started siding with Third Young Madam? It was He Changdi who had arranged for Wenlan and Wenqing to be by Chu Lian\u2019s side. So they were ultimately considered He Changdi\u2019s servants.</p><br/><p>As the two servants started arguing, He Sanlang had finally lost his patience within the study.</p><br/><p>Laiyue and Wenlan were still quarrelling when a shadow darted past them. By the time they regained their senses, all they could only see was Third Young Master\u2019s tall back disappearing into the distance.</p><br/><p>Based on the direction he had gone, it seemed like he was going to look for Third Young Madam\u2026</p><br/><p>He Changdi moved quickly and reached the parlour in no time. Senior Servant Zhong was about to greet him when she saw him coming in, but he simply entered the little study as if he hadn\u2019t seen her at all.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was in the middle of writing down some recipes when the brush in her hand was abruptly taken away.</p><br/><p>She raised her head with bewilderment, only to be met with the gloomy expression on He Changdi\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>The gloomy look in his eyes, the dark aura around him, the sharp angles of his furrowed brows and the thin line formed by his lips; all these signs were a loud declaration that he wasn\u2019t happy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This time, she really did keep completely still, not daring to move a single inch. However, in the next second, Chu Lian realised that there was another layer behind the beardy\u2019s cold words- hidden beneath the anger was a sense of concern for her wellbeing.</p><br/><p>She blinked at him with wide, innocent eyes. Chu Lian wasn\u2019t a person who didn\u2019t appreciate kindness. Since someone else had already taken the initiative to help her, she wasn\u2019t going to reject his help. If she really rejected his help again, she wouldn\u2019t just be stupid, she would be courting death!</p><br/><p>Right now, the two of them were so close that Chu Lian could see each individual eyelash on his eyes.</p><br/><p>What did a man need such long and lovely eyelashes for?</p><br/><p>Although half of his face had been obscured by his beard, she could still tell that underneath all that hair, his features were quite fine. His side profile was especially beautiful with his tall nose bridge, long and narrow eyes, and slightly pale lips.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s interest in seeing what he looked like under that beard was growing.</p><br/><p>After He Sanlang had stopped Chu Lian from moving, he bent down and used both of his hands to pull open the steel trap before carefully lifting her thin ankle out of the cold metal jaws.</p><br/><p>Without any particular expression on his face, He Sanlang asked, \u201cSo why aren\u2019t you talking about keeping a distance between men and women now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tiny bit of goodwill that he had accumulated in Chu Lian\u2019s heart after handling her injured ankle so gently was completely swept away by that one question.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s face was flushed red with anger. However, she couldn\u2019t scold him, either, since she had been in the wrong for being too stubborn earlier. On the other hand, if this beardy hadn\u2019t provoked her with his cold words, how could she have acted so rashly?</p><br/><p>He Changdi watched as the wicked woman\u2019s cheeks turned pink with frustration and her originally wide eyes turned watery, making her look like a little fawn that needed reassurance. She was surely hopping mad within, but she couldn\u2019t find any excuse to vent it out on him. The thought soothed the frustrations in his heart, making his icy expression warm up a little.</p><br/><p>As He Sanlang continued looking at Chu Lian, who was squatting on a dry log, she pouted and turned her head away, intent on sulking. His eyes landed on her injured ankle once again. He hesitated for a moment before squatting down and turning his back to her.</p><br/><p>When Chu Lian caught sight of his strange action, she immediately grew alert. \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang swept a profound gaze over her before stating, \u201cGet on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Get on? On what?</p><br/><p>It was only when Chu Lian looked at his broad back that she finally realised what he wanted. Was he going to piggyback her all the way back?</p><br/><p>The fading blush on her cheeks was reignited once again. This wasn\u2019t much back in the modern world; it would just be seen as a kind and helpful gesture. However, she was in the Great Wu Dynasty right now! The most intimate action she had shared with her husband, He Sanlang, had just been to sleep in the same bed. That had been with separate blankets, too!</p><br/><p>How could she crawl onto a stranger\u2019s back just like that? And\u2026 and this beardy kept a gloomy expression on all day. He probably wasn\u2019t a nice guy at all. He might even be harbouring some bad intentions!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian remained silent, intending for a soundless protest.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s brows furrowed. Clearly unhappy, he said, \u201cSo you don\u2019t want me to carry you? Are you going to walk all the way back yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he stood up and loomed over Chu Lian with his height.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian felt really embarrassed. Every time this beardy opened his mouth, he never failed to aggravate her! She was going to curse this stupid man to a lifetime of solitude!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tried to stand up by herself, but her ankle injury was too severe. She began to teeter and instantly fell back down. Chu Lian was on the verge of tears. She couldn\u2019t put any weight on her right leg.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still want to go back on your own in this condition?\u201d He Sanlang snorted. \u201cYou have two choices. Either stay here to feed the wild beasts, or let me carry you back obediently.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

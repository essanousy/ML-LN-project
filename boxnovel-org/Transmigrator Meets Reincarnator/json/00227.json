Matriarch He was also happy for her old sister upon hearing the news.</p><br/><p>Since Old Duke Zheng was fine now, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for them to continue disturbing his rest. Thus, Matriarch He wanted to bid her goodbyes for today.</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng had just agreed to send them off when her daughter-in-law, the younger Duchess Zheng, tugged at her sleeve and shot a look at her.</p><br/><p>She then whispered a little into Old Duchess Zheng\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>The old woman stiffened for a bit. Her expression turned a little troubled and she turned to Matriarch He with some embarrassment. She then looked again at the bright-eyed Chu Lian standing behind Matriarch He.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Sister, I have a request\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The slight smile on Matriarch He\u2019s face disappeared and she stated sternly, \u201cAlthough we\u2019re not sisters by blood, our friendship is no less closer than any real sisters! What is there that you can\u2019t speak of in front of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing such a generous reassurance from Matriarch He, Old Duchess Zheng finally set down her pride to plead, \u201cCould you let Honoured Lady Jinyi stay in the Zheng Estate for a few more days? Old Sister, you know that my Duke has such a picky appetite. I\u2019m afraid that he won\u2019t want to eat anything again after waking up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng knew that her request was a little too much. Chu Lian wasn\u2019t married to House Zheng and she didn\u2019t have any close connections with House Zheng either. Furthermore, she was already married to someone else. It would be very improper for her to stay at the Zheng Estate.</p><br/><p>Also, this request did make it seem like the old duchess was treating Chu Lian like a mere cook. Even if Chu Lian didn\u2019t hold a ranked noble title like she did now, this was a rather degrading request.</p><br/><p>If this matter didn\u2019t concern Old Duke Zheng\u2019s health, Matriarch He would have thrown a temper at her old sister.</p><br/><p>When she heard this request, Chu Lian\u2019s brows furrowed together. She really wanted to reject it outright, but this was Old Duchess Zheng and Matriarch He\u2019s conversation. It wasn\u2019t her place to speak here, let alone interrupt.</p><br/><p>Thus, Chu Lian\u2019s expectant eyes turned to Matriarch He\u2019s face. If the matriarch \u2018handed\u2019 her out without any hesitation at this moment, then Chu Lian would be utterly disappointed at the \u2018He Family\u2019.</p><br/><p>Any trace of a smile had been completely wiped from Matriarch He\u2019s face. A stern expression took its place instead. She looked at her old sister and shook her head after a moment of thought. She firmly said, \u201cI know you\u2019re anxious, but this request is too unreasonable. Sanlang\u2019s wife is still young. I won\u2019t be able to rest easy if she\u2019s staying out of the Jing\u2019an Estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>On top of that, Chu Lian could only help with the pressing matter at hand, but she couldn\u2019t take care of Old Duke Zheng forever. She wasn\u2019t a servant. She was House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam, Sanlang\u2019s lawfully wedded wife.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hadn\u2019t expected Matriarch He to have refused the request so resolutely. On one hand, she hadn\u2019t been disappointed. On the other, she felt warm inside and her fondness for the He Family grew a little more.</p><br/><p>Due to this fondness, her eyes had lit up brightly with the warmth of her feelings.</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng also hadn\u2019t expected such a curt refusal from her old sister. She didn\u2019t know how to round up the current situation. She opened her mouth, but was at a loss for what to say. Old Duchess Zheng also knew that her request had been too overboard, but she was still unhappy that she had been refused so directly.</p><br/><p>The younger Duchess Zheng didn\u2019t know what to say either, so the air around them turned awkward.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian noticed that the situation was taking a turn for the worse, so after a quick turn of wits, she spoke up, \u201cGrandmother, Old Duchess Zheng is just worried for the old duke. Old Duke Zheng is simply craving for good food. As long as he has something new to eat, he should be fine. Actually, this can be solved even without Granddaughter-in-Law around!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she finished speaking, everyone looked at her with surprise.</p><br/><p>She really had a solution to this problem?</p><br/><p>As long as Matriarch He supported her, she would give her best to help them out. If it was just having to make new delicacies for Old Duke Zheng, then Chu Lian had plenty of ideas that could work even without her there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

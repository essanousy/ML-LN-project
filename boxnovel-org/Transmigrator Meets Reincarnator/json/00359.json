He stood ramrod straight with his chest pushed forward and his chin raised, \u201cThird Young Madam, are you joking with me?! An idea!? I really do have to ask for your pardon, Third Young Madam. I\u2019m just a simple boor without any magic powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mockery in his tone was so thick and infuriating that Wenqing and Wenlan lost their patience. They glared at Mo Chenggui with anger. If not for Chu Lian holding them back, the two ladies would have started fighting with Mo Chenggui on the spot.</p><br/><p>He snorted in response, \u201cHmph! Third Young Madam\u2019s subordinates are really united, huh? Did you bribe them with your food?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian really didn\u2019t understand how this fellow\u2019s mind worked. He couldn\u2019t think of a solution on his own, so he had decided that everyone else was just as stupid as he was. Who knew if it was due to his unwarranted self-confidence or because he thought too highly of himself? If all the soldiers in the army shared the same level of wit as this guy, then the Great Wu Dynasty should just throw down their weapons and admit defeat!</p><br/><p>While Chu Lian normally looked like a young, soft, warm and gentle lady, anyone who assumed that she was an easy target to bully would be the first to face defeat.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t the kind to leave grudges to fester overnight. That was because she would take revenge on the spot the moment anyone dared to bully her!</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui had already crossed the line. Chu Lian had no more patience and tolerance left for him.</p><br/><p>As Wenqing and Wenlan stood behind their Third Young Madam, they noticed that her eyes were shining brightly and her pink lips were drawn up into a smirk despite her grave expression. Although their mistress clearly looked even more vibrant and livelier than normal, the two maidservants shivered in unison.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was doomed. Third Young Madam was really angry this time!</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan exchanged looks with their eyes twitching. They must have been brain dead just now to think that Third Young Madam would be bullied. It would be considered a good day if Third Young Madam didn\u2019t bully someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMo. Cheng. Gui! I really don\u2019t know what Grandfather saw in you to make you one of House Jing\u2019an\u2019s family soldiers! You\u2019re so blinded by your own presumptuous self-conceit; why haven\u2019t you ascended yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>She no longer called him \u2018Uncle Mo\u2019 out of respect for his age and changed to calling his full name directly.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had been holding down her discontent for so long that she felt refreshed upon letting loose her tirade.</p><br/><p>However, Mo Chenggui and the others in the courtyard were all stiff with shock. They directed similar expressions of disbelief at Chu Lian and gulped in unorchestrated unison. They trembled as they thought inwardly, \u2018Third\u2026 Third Young Madam was scolding Leader Mo?\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Third Young Madam was so young, her daring knew no bounds!</p><br/><p>Even the heir\u2019s wife wouldn\u2019t dare to scold Leader Mo right to his face like that\u2026</p><br/><p>For some reason, although they knew that Third Young Madam\u2019s straightforward and bold approach wasn\u2019t right either, they still felt a mysterious sense of satisfaction!</p><br/><p>Everyone stood by silently without moving, hiding their intentions of watching the drama unfold.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui had clearly been dealt a blow by Chu Lian\u2019s words. He opened his eyes wide and glared right back at her. Although he had never heard the word \u2018ascended\u2019 being used to scold others, he could tell that it didn\u2019t mean anything good from her tone.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was just a boorish man to the core. He was the best at using his fists, not his tongue.</p><br/><p>Before he was able to retort, Chu Lian continued her tirade, \u201cMo Chenggui, let me tell you this now! Anything that is impossible to you becomes a real possibility in my hands! Don\u2019t use that narrow-minded gaze of yours to judge others! Just because you can\u2019t do it doesn\u2019t mean that others can\u2019t do it too! I\u2019ll reveal a little more to you; these useless pieces of fir wood might not even be worth a wheat pancake to you, but they\u2019re going to do what you couldn\u2019t do and save those fifty thousand soldiers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind her words, Chu Lian turned and left. Tang Yan, who had been standing right outside the courtyard for some time, had heard her. She trusted that he would be able to take care of the rest.</p><br/><p>Actually, Mo Chenggui wasn\u2019t as bad as Chu Lian made him out to be. He was just too stubborn and didn\u2019t know how to adapt to new changes. She believed that her words would be enough to wake him up and prevent him from becoming an obstacle on their northern journey.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian left just as quickly as she had come like a breeze.</p><br/><p>However, this wasn\u2019t a gentle and refreshing breeze; it was a fearsome hurricane that had completely bowled over everyone present in the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Mo Chenggui was so stunned by the whole chain of events that all the nerves in his body seemed to be frozen. He couldn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

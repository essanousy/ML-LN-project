She couldn\u2019t believe that Count Jing\u2019an had returned earlier than expected.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t what happened in her past life!</p><br/><p>Ever since the count had returned, the situation she had been pushing the estate into was now ruined. It wasn\u2019t possible to use Matriarch He and He Ying to achieve her own motives now.</p><br/><p>She bit her lip and cursed Count Jing\u2019an inwardly.</p><br/><p>In this dark and seemingly boundless place, her eyes were lit up with a fearsome and poisonous glow.</p><br/><p>She scratched at the brocade bedsheets under her, vowing to herself that she would get what she wanted, no matter how vicious she had to be.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day, Count Jing\u2019an, He Changjue and He Changdi headed for the palace together.</p><br/><p>Since the count had just returned to the capital, he had to attend court in the morning before going over to the Ministry of War to hand over his matters, transfer his token of authority, and so on. There was plenty to do.</p><br/><p>He had managed to return to the estate in time yesterday because he had secretly sneaked in some free time.</p><br/><p>Once Count Jing\u2019an returned his token of authority, which gave him command over the troops in the south, he would be bestowed a slack position in the capital and enjoy his retirement. This was the usual way that most of the defender generals retired, so it wasn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>Qinzheng Hall within the palace.</p><br/><p>Court had been dismissed by now, Count Jing\u2019an had been summoned into Qinzheng Hall alone.</p><br/><p>Since Count Jing\u2019an had just returned from Mingzhou and he was an important general who had defended the borders for decades, it wasn\u2019t strange that the Chengping Emperor had summoned him for a private conversation.</p><br/><p>Dressed in a military official\u2019s court outfit, the burly and large Count Jing\u2019an stood like a mountain before the doors of Qinzheng Hall. When Eunuch Wei came out to invite him in, the count followed behind the eunuch carefully.</p><br/><p>A glint flashed through Count Jing\u2019an\u2019s eyes while his head was bowed. His determination could be seen on the set of his brows. He took in a deep breath and lifted his head, his gaze landing upon that imperial yellow figure.</p><br/><p>Although the Emperor was approaching fifty, he remained clean shaven. The men of the Great Wu didn\u2019t keep beards, so the Emperor had followed that rule.</p><br/><p>The beardless Emperor looked five to six years younger than his real age, making him look in his early forties.</p><br/><p>However, Count Jing\u2019an was different.</p><br/><p>Although he was younger than the Emperor by a year, his face had been weathered by hardship and there were a few strands of white in his hair, making him look much older.</p><br/><p>The wrinkles at the corners of his mouth were prominent. Adding on to that his beard, he looked a decade older than the Emperor.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the footsteps of the approaching count, the Emperor looked up from the imperial reports and gazed upon Count Jing\u2019an.</p><br/><p>There was an unreadable look in the Emperor\u2019s eyes. It wasn\u2019t appreciation towards a loyal subject, nor admiration. It was far from trust and gratitude as well.</p><br/><p>In a nutshell, it was a strange look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe Yanwen. It\u2019s been years since we last met. We hope you\u2019re doing fine,\u201d The Chengping Emperor threw out these unexpected words with a straight face, causing his trusted attendant, Eunuch Wei, to tremble a little behind him.</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an bowed his head and body slightly, giving the Emperor an appropriate salute, not an inch more or less.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefender General of the South, He Yanwen, greets Your Majesty. Long live Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chengping Emperor\u2019s tone cooled down all of a sudden, \u201cLong live? He Yanwen, you had better drop all pretenses. If you truly wished for us to live a long life, then you wouldn\u2019t have done <i>that </i>in the past!\u201d</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an had a bitter smile in his heart. As expected, despite the many years that had passed, the Emperor hadn\u2019t forgotten that incident in the past.</p><br/><p>However, the past is dead. There was no way to return to that time again.</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an sighed inwardly, \u201cThis humble official will accept any punishment as Your Majesty wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Emperor flew into a rage upon seeing the count\u2019s unruffled appearance. The anger that he had been suppressing for years was instantly ignited, warping his mien beyond recognition.</p><br/><p>He shoved the extremely priceless jade Jingtai teapot off his desk, roaring furiously, \u201cHe Yanwan! Don\u2019t you assume that we don\u2019t dare to sentence you to death! If she hadn\u2019t pled mercy for you back then, we would have split into a thousand pieces by now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Count Jing\u2019an lowered his eyes, but his burly body remained standing strong like a majestic mountain. He was a staunch and unyielding obstacle in the Emperor\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis humble official will accept any punishment as Your Majesty wishes.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

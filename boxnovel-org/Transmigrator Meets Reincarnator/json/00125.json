Since Chu Lian didn\u2019t even want to reach over and accept the gift, he pulled it back towards himself, opened it up, and placed it in front of her again.</p><br/><p>He put on his warmest, most persuasive tone of voice and said, \u201cLian\u2019er, take a look. It\u2019s the golden hairpin with jade inlays that you were eyeing for so long back then. Do you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian swept her gaze over it. The hairpin was covered in exquisitely engraved flower patterns. Both the hearts of the flowers and their petals were decorated in high quality jade. On the head of the hairpin were five small sapphires glimmering in the light, forming the largest flower of them all. This accessory was indeed of high value, and it was certainly beautiful; no wonder the previous \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 had yearned over it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2019s expression softened a little, perhaps due to sensing Chu Lian\u2019s admiration of his gift.</p><br/><p>Since his Lian\u2019er didn\u2019t want to speak, then he could be the one to fill the silence. He had to let Lian\u2019er understand the true depths of his sincerity. That damn He Changdi wasn\u2019t good enough for her!</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, it\u2019s Brother Xiao who was wrong. I should have bought this hairpin for you earlier. After making you wait for so long, why don\u2019t you let Brother Xiao put it on for you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She was already at her limit just trying to keep up her calm facade! What was this guy trying to do now?!</p><br/><p>What the two of them didn\u2019t know, was that their whole conversation had been heard by Prince Jin in the private room next door.</p><br/><p>Waves of emotion rippled across the calm lakes of Prince Jin\u2019s azure eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian?</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected Miss Chu to be so daring. Prince Jin instantly felt gratified that he had chosen to follow Miss Chu here. He was also starting to understand why He Sanlang had asked him to keep a watch on this newlywed wife of his.</p><br/><p>His azure eyes glimmered and the corner of his mouth raised; all this was going to be even more fun now.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hurriedly waved away the offer. For the sake of placating Xiao Bojian\u2019s anger, she could only say in a small voice, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I\u2019ll just bring it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, she picked up the plain brocade box from the table and passed it to Xiyan, who was waiting behind her.</p><br/><p>Seeing Chu Lian accept the gift, Xiao Bojian seemed to finally relax and stopped trying to put it on for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, wait a little longer for Brother Xiao, won\u2019t you? Trust Brother Xiao. It won\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian stared at the tender, fair little hands that Chu Lian had placed on her knees. He had the urge to take them and cover them with his own large palms so that he could massage them. The more he thought about it, the more tempting it was. He unconsciously kneaded his palms with his fingers.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had to resist the urge to glare back at him with all her might. Could this damned Xiao Bojian stop pushing his one-sided feelings on her? Had he ever considered her feelings in the matter? As expected, he was extremely hateful, and even more annoying than He Changdi!</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian was about to continue speaking when a loud bang resounded from next door. Chu Lian suffered a fright\u2013 what followed was the clanging sound of a fight.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s expression immediately turned serious as she looked at the wall separating her room from the one next door.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian sat up in his seat, clearly startled by the noise as well. He was more sensitive than Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>At that exact moment, a man dressed in grey came out from the shadows and walked up to Xiao Bojian. He whispered into Xiao Bojian\u2019s ears, seemingly reporting something.</p><br/><p>The furrow between Xiao Bojian\u2019s brows grew more pronounced. He reached out to grab Chu Lian, who was just a short distance away, but the man dressed in grey held him back.</p><br/><p>The man said, \u201cMaster, there\u2019s no time, we have to leave quickly. If those people discover us, the consequences will be dire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Lian\u2019er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Chu is not their target; she\u2019ll be fine! Come with me, quickly! If you don\u2019t leave now, all the years of preparation will be ruined in an instant!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She lowered her head and led the other maidservants out and took her post by the kitchen entrance again.</p><br/><p>Xiyan washed the oranges before passing them to Chu Lian. In order to make them look more appetising, Chu Lian carefully carved out some simple patterns on the skins of the fruits. After that, she cut them open. When it came to the third orange, as she slid the knife into the orange, it was suddenly blocked by something within. Chu Lian frowned and pulled the orange apart. Somehow, there was a thin iron capsule within!</p><br/><p>Xiyan\u2019s eyes widened and her face was filled with shock.</p><br/><p>Conversely, Chu Lian had only paused for a moment before calming down. She shot a glance at Xiyan before looking at Mingyan, who was busy cooking porridge at the stove, indicating that Xiyan had to stay quiet.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian quickly pulled out that thin iron capsule with her nimble fingers. She found the mechanism that kept it closed and activated it, opening the capsule with a quiet click. Inside was a small roll of paper. </p><br/><p>As for why Chu Lian was so familiar with the capsule\u2019s mechanism, she had read it in the original novel before. Xiao Bojian liked to send messages to \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 in this manner. He had used these kinds of iron capsules previously.</p><br/><p>Before she even opened the paper roll, Chu Lian noticed a small \u2018Xiao\u2019 written on the outside.</p><br/><p>As expected, this was a message from Xiao Bojian!</p><br/><p>That Xiao Bojian was still this delusional! He still thought that she liked him and refused to go away. Rage surfaced in Chu Lian\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>She immediately lost all interest in the note\u2019s contents. In front of Xiyan, she threw the unopened note and capsule into the fire of the stove. Sparks flew from the roaring fire, turning the note into ashes.</p><br/><p>When Xiyan saw Chu Lian\u2019s actions with her own eyes, a sense of relief came over her heart. She knew that her master didn\u2019t have any feelings for Mister Xiao at all. Her master\u2019s decision was right.</p><br/><p>She was House Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam now. Even though she wasn\u2019t the lady-in-charge of the main branch, she was still the mistress of the third branch. She also had the title of Honoured Lady Jinyi now. Even if she didn\u2019t want to fight for more status and power, she still had to uphold her responsibility and reputation.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, other than leaving for the northern border, Young Master hadn\u2019t let down Third Young Madam in any other way. Even without including Third Young Master\u2019s handsome looks, just based on the He Family\u2019s rules, it was a House worthy of Third Young Madam\u2019s efforts to protect it. For a noble lady who married into a distinguished house, it was quite rare that they didn\u2019t have to face an inner court full of their husband\u2019s concubines.</p><br/><p>Just based on that alone, it was worth the effort for Third Young Madam to keep her reputation clean.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, He Sanlang had a good family background and was so much better than Mister Xiao.</p><br/><p>It was all that Mister Xiao\u2019s fault! Their young miss had already married someone else. Why was he still latching on to her like a leech and refusing to let go?</p><br/><p>Xiyan vented her hatred on Xiao Bojian in her heart. The originally kind and gentle handmaid was now questioning Xiao Bojian\u2019s ancestors in her mind about the wretch their family had given birth to.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glanced at Xiyan and instructed her in a calm tone. \u201cYou never saw that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan nodded in acknowledgement.</p><br/><p>After that, Chu Lian continued preparing the oranges as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, the warming and nourishing ginseng porridge as well as the fragrant stuffed orange with crab meat were both done. Chu Lian then specially cooked up two side dishes with her own hands.</p><br/><p>Old Duke Zheng had been bedridden for a long time and had stopped eating for quite a few days. He couldn\u2019t eat anything hard. Thus, she had picked out some foods with softer textures for him.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian cleaned up a little before having her maidservants carry the food in some food containers. They then rushed back to Old Duke Zheng\u2019s bedroom .</p><br/><p>Back in the Zheng Estate\u2019s outer court, Xiao Bojian was left alone in the study. Heir Zheng had already rushed off to the inner court.</p><br/><p>There was a vast collection of books in the Zheng Estate\u2019s study, so Xiao Bojian came over regularly to borrow books. At this moment, the secret guard One was whispering into Xiao Bojian\u2019s ear while disguised as a manservant.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian frowned. His tone carried a trace of anger as he spoke, \u201cWhat? She threw the note into the fire without looking at it?\u201d</p><br/><p>One stood respectfully at one side and nodded.</p><br/><p>Rage rose like a wave in Xiao Bojian\u2019s chest. He leaned against the boxwood chair with his eyes shut for a long moment before managing to calm himself down again.</p><br/><p>Lian\u2019er! How could you be so silly? Why don\u2019t you trust me? Do you know what I wrote in that note?!</p><br/><p>Bitterness and helplessness were mixed in Xiao Bojian\u2019s thoughts. He really wanted to grab that annoying woman and bully her a little to vent his frustrations.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

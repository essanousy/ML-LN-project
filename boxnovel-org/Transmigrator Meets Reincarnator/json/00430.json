She hadn\u2019t expected those to be He Sanlang\u2019s first words after seeing her again.</p><br/><p>The way he was acting now was exactly like a dog that had been ignored by his owner. She didn\u2019t know how to react.</p><br/><p>The corners of her lips twitched and she headed over to the bedside with Wenqing trailing after her.</p><br/><p>She sat down on the stool next to the bed and started speaking, \u201cSince Laiyue has gone out, I\u2019ll be the one to help change your bandages later. It\u2019s already the twenty-seventh, so you should take a bath at the same time. I\u2019ll put on your ointments after you\u2019re done with your bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi turned back around and looked at Chu Lian silently.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian remained her usual calm and easygoing self. \u201cHe Changdi, if you don\u2019t answer me, then I\u2019ll take it that you\u2019ve agreed.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she was done, Chu Lian turned to Wenqing and told her to get the maidservants to prepare the items required for a bath.</p><br/><p>Just as Chu Lian stood up to look for bandages and gauze, He Changdi directed his frosty gaze at the servants present in the room. The maidservants trembled and retreated quietly.</p><br/><p>A trace of satisfaction showed on He Changdi\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>As Chu Lian set the bandages and gauze to one side, together with the ointments that she had ordered to be brought to her, she felt that the room was strangely quiet. It was when she turned around and looked around the room that she realised she and He Changdi had been left alone.</p><br/><p>She put the medicine box down and shot a confused look at He Sanlang, \u201cWhere\u2019s everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi was calm as he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve sent them away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah? Chu Lian didn\u2019t understand. What had he sent them all away for?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something important you have to tell me?\u201d Chu Lian sat down next to He Sanlang and drew close to him, expecting some secret.</p><br/><p>Although there was still some distance between them, He Changdi could already smell the fragrance on Chu Lian\u2019s body. He couldn\u2019t tell what fragrance she used, but he just thought that it was very nice.</p><br/><p>There was a faint smile in He Changdi\u2019s eyes, though he wasn\u2019t aware of it.</p><br/><p>He tilted his body slightly to become even closer to Chu Lian. His breath was now gliding across Chu Lian\u2019s soft cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anything major, but I want you to help check my wounds. They were hurting a little when I woke up this morning.\u201d He Sanlang\u2019s tone was very cool and impersonal. Aside from his heated breathing, he had managed to hide his \u2018evil\u2019 intentions very well.</p><br/><p>If this had been a normal situation, Chu Lian would definitely have been able to detect the white lie in his words. However, when it came to matters concerning his body, Chu Lian instantly tensed up and forgot her usual calm.</p><br/><p>Astonishment and reproach were displayed on her expression as she admonished him, \u201cDid it only start hurting this morning? How about during the past two days? He Changdi, are you stupid? Why didn\u2019t you mention your wounds hurting before? Why would you bear with the pain silently!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once she had finished her scolding, she quickly reached out for the blankets covering He Changdi.</p><br/><p>The old physician had gone home for the New Year the day before yesterday. Since He Changdi\u2019s injuries had been healing well, Chu Lian had not asked the old physician to come to the He Estate every day. Before the old physician had left, he had also left instructions for them. As long as his bandages were changed daily and he continued drinking his medicine, he would be able to walk in another month. After the few days he had spent recuperating from his wounds, there was no longer any danger to his life. It was only a matter of time before he was fully healed.</p><br/><p>However, Chu Lian had also seen the state of He Sanlang\u2019s injuries with her own eyes. His leg had been a bloody mess at the time and it was extremely frightening. That was why she reacted immediately when He Sanlang mentioned that his wounds hurt.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang suddenly felt guilty upon seeing how panicked Chu Lian was over him. He wanted to reach out to hold her still and stop her frantic movements.</p><br/><p>However, Chu Lian couldn\u2019t rest easy until she inspected his wounds personally after finding out that his wounds were hurting. In the modern world, there were many cases where external wounds would fester and become inflamed if they weren\u2019t taken care of properly. If that happened to He Changdi, the result would be even worse than the original state of his injuries.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pushed away He Sanlang\u2019s hand and puffed up her cheeks. She threw a glare in He Changdi\u2019s direction with an angry huff, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare move, or your wounds might be affected!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian had been going for a fierce tone, her voice was naturally soft and charming. Even though she tried to harden her stance, there wasn\u2019t a single threatening bone in her. Instead, He Changdi felt warm inside. He wanted to pull the angry little kitten in front of him into his arms for a nice round of snuggles and pets.</p><br/><p>It was only then that He Sanlang finally realised he wasn\u2019t going to win over his stubborn wife when she was on a roll. Thus, with a resigned smile, he laid back against the headboard and let her do as he wished.</p><br/><p>The wound on He Changdi\u2019s right leg was on the inner part of his thigh. Actually, it was very dangerous to have a wound at that spot as it was close to a major artery. Any cuts could easily cause extreme blood loss and death.</p><br/><p>Lucky for He Sanlang, he had somehow escaped that fate- the wound hadn\u2019t gotten close to his artery. Right now, he was only dressed in a pair of really short pants to make it easier to change the bandages every day. The pants were so short that they only covered the most important parts of his lower body.</p><br/><p>Once Chu Lian had gotten the blanket out of the way, she was met with the sight of He Sanlang\u2019s muscled thigh all covered in bandages.</p><br/><p>She glanced at him and said, \u201cBear with it for a while, I\u2019m going to remove the bandages and check on your wound.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before He Sanlang could give his assent, she had already started to untie the bandages.</p><br/><p>The corners of He Changdi\u2019s lips twitched. How were her movements so fast?</p><br/><p>He watched Chu Lian\u2019s serious expression as she went about her task. Although his features were still locked in their usual cool mien, there was warmth welling up deep inside his heart.</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since he had experienced being cared for like this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

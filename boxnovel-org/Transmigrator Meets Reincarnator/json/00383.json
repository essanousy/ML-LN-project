He Changdi couldn\u2019t be more familiar with the carvings on that jade.</p><br/><p>That was the lucky jade amulet that Grandmother had given Chu Lian on the second day of their marriage at the tea ceremony. His grandfather had worn it often while he had still been alive.</p><br/><p>Why was that jade amulet hanging off Xiao Bojian\u2019s waist?!</p><br/><p>The darkness in He Sanlang\u2019s eyes gathered into a thick fog. The hands resting at his sides clenched into fists, and his knuckles creaked as if he might break his own fingers.</p><br/><p>However, a thread of reason still remained within him, keeping him from losing control and grabbing Xiao Bojian by the collar to interrogate him.</p><br/><p>Just that tiny ripple of emotion in He Changdi was enough for Xiao Bojian to sense that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Bojian noticed that his expression had turned into one of restraint, he looked at He Changdi with a faint smile. \u201cOh? Are you perhaps feeling well, He Sanlang? Should I send one of the doctors over to look you over?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xiao Bojian spoke, he couldn\u2019t help stroking the warm jade at his waist.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s expression sunk and he turned and left the commander\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian looked at He Changdi\u2019s hastily retreating back and let out a bark of laughter out of the blue.</p><br/><p>The guard following closely behind him nearly shivered as goosebumps rose all over his body. One knew that it was never a good thing whenever his master laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian turned around and spoke as he played with the jade in his hand, \u201cLet\u2019s return to our tent. It seems like things are getting more interesting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All the anger he had felt from Chu Lian leaving for the north so abruptly without a word had been instantly calmed by the sight of He Changdi\u2019s expression just now. Xiao Bojian knew exactly why He Changdi had been unhappy.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know where this jade amulet had come from, it was likely something precious, judging from the shade of red that He Changdi\u2019s face had turned into.</p><br/><p>Since Lian\u2019er had given such a precious jade amulet to him, that clearly meant that he was the one in Lian\u2019er\u2019s heart. He Sanlang was probably nothing compared to him.</p><br/><p>On the way back to his tent, Xiao Bojian\u2019s exquisite features were contorted into a ruthless expression. \u201cOne, report on the matters that I ordered you to investigate. The mountain paths have been blocked for days and the snow is up to our knees. How did they make it over with a carriage to ask for aid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since Xiao Bojian had earned the top rank in the imperial examinations, One had been ever more careful with his moody and unpredictable master.</p><br/><p>He replied, \u201cHe Sanlang didn\u2019t use a carriage. He used something called a snowboat. From what this subordinate heard, it can glide over snow and ice and its speed doesn\u2019t lose out to that of carriages.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d A flash of alarm flitted across Xiao Bojian\u2019s face. How had he never heard of something like that before?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is all this subordinate has been able to find out so far. The snowboat that they brought here is being closely guarded by his men. Even our spies won\u2019t be able to get close to it so soon.\u201d One added with his head lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue investigating!\u201d Xiao Bojian\u2019s voice turned a little hoarse from his displeasure.</p><br/><p>What kind of weapon was that? He Changdi couldn\u2019t have had it from the start, or the northern border troops wouldn\u2019t have waited until now!</p><br/><p>There must be someone helping them from the shadows.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian clenched his fists. His plans had been completely disrupted by He Changdi\u2019s arrival.</p><br/><p>He Changdi and his group were brought to the tent they had been assigned.</p><br/><p>On the way there, Xiao Hongyu and Zhang Mai could sense that He Changdi\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t very good.</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai knew that He Sanlang was a quiet one. Even if he had something weighing on his heart, he would only keep it in and stew on it by himself. He would never talk to someone to help release the burdens he carried within.</p><br/><p>He patted He Changdi on the shoulder, \u201cAfter being on the road for so long, let\u2019s take a hot bath and rest for a bit. No matter what it is, perhaps you\u2019ll be able to think through it once you have a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, he pulled Xiao Hongyu with him and left the tent.</p><br/><p>Once Zhang Mai and Xiao Hongyu had left, He Changdi could no longer hold back the frustration in his heart. He turned to the table in the tent and flipped it over.</p><br/><p>He was feeling very conflicted right now.</p><br/><p>Although he had finally cleared up the feelings in his heart, he had suddenly been dealt a sound slap in the face!</p><br/><p>What did that wicked woman Chu Lian want?</p><br/><p>He had started trusting in her, but he had just seen grandfather\u2019s jade amulet on Xiao Bojian!</p><br/><p>He Sanlang felt torn apart by his pain. He didn\u2019t know how to face his budding feelings for Chu Lian now. It was impossible for him to ignore what had just happened too!</p><br/><p>He wanted so badly to fly back to Chu Lian\u2019s side right now and ask her about everything once and for all.</p><br/><p>Thuds sounded in the tent as the table flew to the floor and the tea set that had been on top shattered.</p><br/><p>The ear-piercing sharp sounds calmed down the raging tsunami within He Changdi\u2019s heart. He laid down on the bed, completely worn out. His chest rose and fell with his breathing as he covered his eyes with one arm. Snippets of his past and current lives flashed through his mind. The current He Changdi was very, very lost.</p><br/><p>Two days later, Xiao Bojian finally got news of the snowboat.</p><br/><p>One handed a tiny metal tube to Xiao Bojian, \u201cMaster, this is what our spy in the northern border sent over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian tapped the trigger on the surface of the tube, causing the tube to spring open, revealing a slender roll of paper within. There was only a single line of words on the note, but that was enough to make Xiao Bojian start trembling with emotion.</p><br/><p>Lian\u2019er! So it was Lian\u2019er! He just knew it. How could the bunch of old men in the north have come up with the snowboat? Such an innovative and novel idea could only have come from his brilliant Lian\u2019er!</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian trembled with excitement. He wanted to be right in front of Chu Lian right now. He wanted to trap her in his embrace and plant a kiss on those petal-like lips of hers.</p><br/><p>However, before he even finished getting over his excitement, an icy aura started creeping back over his body.</p><br/><p>He had suddenly realised that Chu Lian hadn\u2019t made that marvellous snowboat for him\u2026 she had made it for that He Changdi!</p><br/><p>His hands turned into tightly clenched fists. Due to the abrupt change in his emotions, he started coughing intensely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

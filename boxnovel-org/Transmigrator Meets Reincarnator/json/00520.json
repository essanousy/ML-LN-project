She also wanted to remind Matriarch He that it had been the matriarch herself who had said that Guilin Restaurant would belong to Chu Lian back then. No matter how much it earned, all profits would belong to the third branch.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there was no such things as video or voice recordings in this era, so even if she pointed these out, they would never admit to it.</p><br/><p>After Matriarch He spoke, He Ying\u2019s brows immediately furrowed together. She looked towards Chu Lian, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Sanlang\u2019s wife, the Longtaitou festival has already passed, why hasn\u2019t Guilin Restaurant opened up for business? Practically every other shop in the capital has already opened by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any expression in particular on Chu Lian\u2019s face. She put on a benign smile and said, \u201cI ordered the managers to renovate the restaurant and it was delayed until now, which is why it hasn\u2019t reopened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the renovation going?\u201d The matriarch asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s almost finished, it\u2019s better not to delay the reopening date for too long. Do reopen as soon as possible then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian smiled at her.</p><br/><p>He Ying had been keeping a close eye on Chu Lian\u2019s expression. Noticing that there wasn\u2019t a trace of disagreement in her, He Ying continued, \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, I\u2019ve also heard Mother mention that Guilin Restaurant was given to you, and that the deed is in your hands. However, when all\u2019s said and done, you\u2019re part of our He Family now. Right now, the estate\u2019s public funds are severely lacking. Using the profits of Guilin Restaurant to fill the estate\u2019s coffers was something that Mother had no choice but to do. I hope you\u2019ll understand why Mother did this. At her age, it\u2019s not easy to keep this large estate going.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ying paused, fully into her role as a caring senior, \u201cBut there\u2019s something I need to be frank with you about, please don\u2019t get angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was tempted to reply with, \u2018If you know I\u2019m going to get angry, you might as well not say it.\u2019</p><br/><p>He Ying stared at Chu Lian, believing that there was nothing but absolute sincerity in her eyes right now, \u201cI\u2019ve been by Mother\u2019s side long than you have. Guilin Restaurant was part of the dowry given to my mother by my grandmother. Back when I got married, Mother couldn\u2019t bear to give it to me, yet she gave it to you. From that, we could see how important you are to Mother. However, in the end, the long-established Guilin Restaurant still belongs to Mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian tilted her head to the side and met with He Ying\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, if there\u2019s something you\u2019re trying to imply, please say it straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the edges of He Ying\u2019s mouth curved upwards, the wrinkles at the sides of her lips looked like they were carved into her skin, giving her the appearance of an extremely harsh person. \u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, I like your straightforward attitude. Fine then, I\u2019ll state it bluntly. Since you know that Guilin Restaurant\u2019s earnings have been drawn into the public accounts now, it isn\u2019t very appropriate for the deed to be in your hands, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>After all that setup, they just wanted to take Guilin Restaurant back and appropriate it for themselves.</p><br/><p>He Ying was using the logic of a bandit.</p><br/><p>A mocking thought popped up in Chu Lian\u2019s mind. Going by her aunt-in-law\u2019s logic, if she stayed long-term in their house, then the deed of the house should naturally belong to her.</p><br/><p>She would have retorted back in a temper, if not for the fact that the person in front of her was House Jing\u2019an\u2019s matriarch and He Sanlang\u2019s own grandmother. Chu Lian had to keep in mind her position as a He Family daughter-in-law, and the deed had indeed been a present from the matriarch.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have tolerated all this.</p><br/><p>If all they wanted was Guilin Restaurant, she would let them have it!</p><br/><p>With an indifferent expression, Chu Lian asked the matriarch, \u201cIs this your stance as well, Grandmother?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was an awkward look on the matriarch\u2019s face. She had just recalled that she had stated that all earnings would be theirs when gifting Guilin Restaurant to Chu Lian. She had even assigned Manager Qin to be Chu Lian\u2019s assistant for this purpose.</p><br/><p>In the end, she was the one who had broken her promise first.</p><br/><p>At this moment, she didn\u2019t know how to compose herself.</p><br/><p>However, when she thought about the monthly profits of Guilin Restaurant, Matriarch He\u2019s will became resolute. She bore with the embarrassment, gritted her teeth, and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSanlang\u2019s wife, lay the blame for this on me. Our estate truly needs the funds right now. This decision is certainly unfair to you, so let me make it up to you. I\u2019ll take responsibility and transfer two fabric stores from the public accounts to you in exchange, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fabric stores?</p><br/><p>How funny. Was the matriarch going to ask for those back again once she made them profitable like Guilin?</p><br/><p>She was taking Chu Lian for a fool!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian turned her head back and beckoned Wenqing over. The handmaid took out a long wooden box from her sleeve and handed it over to Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stood up from her seat, took two steps forward, and placed the box on the table by the matriarch\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian spoke up, \u201cGrandmother, since this is your wish, then I shall return this deed to you in the exact same condition as it was when you gave it to me! Like Aunt said, Guilin Restaurant wasn\u2019t originally mine, it was part of your dowry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the lady-in-charge of the house, Grandmother, so I\u2019ll defer to you. Now that Guilin Restaurant has been transferred to the public accounts, it naturally won\u2019t be of any concern to me. From now on, all matters regarding Guilin Restaurant will be handled by you, Grandmother.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a slight pause, she continued, \u201cAs for the stores you mentioned for exchange, I wouldn\u2019t dare to accept them. My younger cousin, Miss Pan, hasn\u2019t found a match yet, so please keep it for her dowry instead.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

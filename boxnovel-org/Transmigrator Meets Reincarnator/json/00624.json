We want to know everything regarding House Ying\u2019s original Second Madam and Sixth Miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Lin swiftly left Qinzheng Hall in fear after receiving his secret order. He was scared that the emperor would kick him out if he didn\u2019t move faster.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei, who was waiting on the side, had also already guessed the truth. He was currently deep in his thoughts and very shocked. Honoured Lady Jinyi was actually the Emperor\u2019s daughter\u2026</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei was in a trance when he suddenly heard the emperor ask, \u201cXiao Haizi, what do you think of Jinyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Chenghai was so scared that he promptly focused all of his attention. At this time, he wouldn\u2019t dare say anything bad about Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonoured Lady Jinyi is intelligent, dignified, and quick-witted. She\u2019s also a very talented cook. This servant has never seen a noble lady as special as Honoured Lady Jinyi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei\u2019s reply had obviously pleased the emperor.</p><br/><p>The emperor rubbed his clean-shaven jaw and recalled the first time he met Chu Lian. That little girl hadn\u2019t seemed flustered at all even when she was in front of him.</p><br/><p>She was neither humble nor arrogant. She had been able to think of an unexpected plan to save Duanjia during a dangerous situation. She had also opened a restaurant that was famed throughout the entire capital. There were also the snowboats and her business ideas.</p><br/><p>How had her little head come up with all those ideas? Why was she so clever and cute? She must have inherited it from him. Ah-Xun was also very smart, but she hadn\u2019t had such a creative imagination and practical ability.</p><br/><p>She must have gotten those from him.</p><br/><p>The emperor momentarily fell into a realm of fantasy. Ye Xun had passed away for many years, and he had always been living in pain. However, he had never expected that Ye Xun would leave a child for him.</p><br/><p>This child was the continuation of Ye Xun\u2019s life and the proof of their love.</p><br/><p>Jinyi was the same age as Duanjia, so she was sixteen this year. The emperor made some calculations in his mind. If he and Ye Xun had a child, then the child would be precisely sixteen years old.</p><br/><p>Even before receiving the results from He Lin\u2019s investigation, he was nearly certain that Chu Lian was indeed his child.</p><br/><p>When he thought about it now, it seemed that he liked everything about Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>However, the smile on the emperor\u2019s face froze an instant later\u2026</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei, who was standing beside him, was extremely frightened as he observed him. Too many things had happened tonight. Even someone like him, who had experienced numerous upheavals and changes, was a little overwhelmed with shock. When he noticed the change in his master\u2019s expression, his legs nearly went limp from the fright.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei summoned up his courage and asked, \u201cYour Majesty, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor had just remembered that Chu Lian had already married someone. Moreover, her husband was He Yanwen\u2019s son. So, he was immediately pent up with anger.</p><br/><p>It felt like he had just found a long-lost treasure after much difficulty, but the treasure was already engraved with someone else\u2019s name because it had been missing for too long\u2026</p><br/><p>The emperor sneered. \u201cThat brat got off easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eunuch Wei\u2019s face twitched and immediately realised who the emperor was talking about.</p><br/><p>The person that the emperor was referring to was the current administrator of the Department of Appointments, Marquis Anyuan\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian and He Changdi returned to Songtao Court together. They didn\u2019t know about the major revelations the ruler of their kingdom was currently experiencing in his seat within the palace. They also didn\u2019t know that her body had another identity.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was relieved that Prince Jin had remained calm and decided not to intervene with the trouble caused by the crown prince today.</p><br/><p>In his previous life, tonight had been the significant turning point in his close friend\u2019s life. The situation had changed now, so He Changdi was in a very good mood.</p><br/><p>When the couple returned to Songtao Court, it was already late at night.</p><br/><p>It was a hassle to travel back and forth to the palace to attend the banquet. Moreover, an incident had occurred in the middle of the banquet, so they were both sweating right now.</p><br/><p>It was necessary for them to change and take a bath.</p><br/><p>Songtao Court was very big, so there was more than one bathroom. The bathroom in He Changdi\u2019s study was even more spacious.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sat in front of the dressing table, while Xiyan helped her remove the hairpins in her hair. After that, she took off the outer robe that she was wearing and finally felt more at ease.</p><br/><p>When she finished, she noticed that He Changdi was still sitting beside the table. She curiously asked, \u201cWhy are you still here? I thought you were tired. Why haven\u2019t you gone to take a bath?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi held a teacup and took a sip of warm water. He didn\u2019t immediately answer Chu Lian\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian thought he wanted her to bathe first, so she happily said, \u201cYou should go ahead. I already told Xiyan to prepare the bath over at the bathroom in the study. All the necessities are already prepared over there, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi remained silent even after she said that, so Chu Lian couldn\u2019t help turning around and looking towards He Changdi.</p><br/><p>When their eyes met, Chu Lian noticed that there was something wrong with He Changdi\u2019s gaze. She could see it contained both passion and stubbornness alike.</p><br/><p>However, that kind of look really didn\u2019t match with his icy face\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s face instantly flushed because of the way he was looking at her. She stuttered, \u201cWhy are you looking at me and not going to the bathroom?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi, who was a miser with his words, finally spoke now. His voice had an alluring magnetism. His chuckle seemed to carry a sense of teasing, which made her heart quiver as he said, \u201cWhat? Did you forget what you promised me earlier?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

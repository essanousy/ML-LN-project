The Empress Dowager even specially awarded her with a sapphire headdress, adding on to House Jing\u2019an\u2019s glory at the event.</p><br/><p>Even after so many years, Matriarch He had never enjoyed such attention in the palace before. Of course, she was in an extremely good mood now. Chu Lian kept by her grandmother\u2019s side, so there were many questions directed towards her by the noble ladies around them.</p><br/><p>Since Matriarch He had the intention of introducing her to the others, Chu Lian took the chance to get acquainted with a number of noble madams in the capital.</p><br/><p>When it was time to leave the palace, Princess Wei specially sent one of her court ladies over to invite her over to Prince Wei\u2019s estate to play in a few days, thus drawing another wave of envy from the ladies gathered.</p><br/><p>When they finally reached House Jing\u2019an\u2019s carriage, Chu Lian was about to help Matriarch He up the carriage when they were hailed by an elderly madam who had come rushing over from behind.</p><br/><p>This elderly madam was no stranger; it was Old Duchess Zheng. There was a middle-aged lady following next to the old duchess, who was slightly chubby. When she smiled, her eyes morphed into upturned crescents, giving her a friendly appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Sister, please hold on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He turned around only to see her old friend. She smiled in welcome, \u201cWe\u2019re sisters, the two of us. Why the rush? Walk a little slower, and be careful not to strain your waist!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng came over with a wide smile. When she reached Matriarch He\u2019s side, she first smiled at Chu Lian before talking to the matriarch. \u201cI have come looking for Old Sister for a certain matter\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so courteous between us. Just say it straight.\u201d Matriarch He answered generously.</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng was about to speak of her matter when Chu Lian caught sight of some people who had just exited the palace behind them. That person with a round face and slender brows; wasn\u2019t that Lady Pan?</p><br/><p>Hadn\u2019t she left the banquet early on? Why was she only exiting the palace at this hour?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s brows drew together in a slight frown. They had offended Lady Pan today, so she was afraid that they would get into a quarrel if they bumped into each other now. Thus, she spoke up with a suggestion, \u201cGrandmother, there are many people coming and going from the palace entrance here. How about chatting inside the carriage instead? It might be more comfortable for Grandmother and Old Duchess Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He had clearly spotted Lady Pan on the way out of the palace with her group of servants in tow. Thus, she invited Old Duchess Zheng onto House Jing\u2019an\u2019s wide carriage and they boarded together.</p><br/><p>Although the carriage was quite spacious, it wasn\u2019t meant to be a room after all. When all four of them entered, it became a little cramped.</p><br/><p>Madam Zou had just lifted the curtain and was about to enter, when Matriarch He spoke to her. \u201cDalang\u2019s wife, the carriage is a little cramped. Go to the other carriage at the back instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hand that Madam Zou was using to hold up the carriage curtain clenched. She looked up at the four people seated in the carriage before bowing slightly to Matriarch He and leaving for the other carriage.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glanced at Madam Zou\u2019s departing figure and sighed inwardly.</p><br/><p>The distance between them had still increased in the end.</p><br/><p>Her eldest sister-in-law was already looking at her through tinted glasses. From now on, no matter what she did, Madam Zou would probably look badly on her. Chu Lian wasn\u2019t one to go seeking trouble if no one tried to attack her. Although she didn\u2019t like squabbling over petty matters, she wasn\u2019t one to sit back and let others take her to task either. In the future, she and Madam Zou would be like a well and a river; their waters were not to seep and mix into each other.</p><br/><p>Duke Zheng\u2019s estate wasn\u2019t far from Count Jing\u2019an\u2019s estate. They would be taking the same route along Zhuque Avenue for some time anyway, so this was a convenient time for them to talk.</p><br/><p>With House Zheng\u2019s carriage following behind, the two old sisters chatted in House Jing\u2019an\u2019s carriage with a lively air.</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng had also seen something fishy in the events at the banquet. She held onto Matriarch He\u2019s hand and reassured her, \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for things like that to happen when it comes to such a big occasion. It\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019ve made it out safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matriarch He nodded and smiled at Old Duchess Zheng. \u201cOh, you. Stop thinking about that. Hasn\u2019t our House benefited from that unfortunate turn of events?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng smiled and looked at Chu Lian. \u201cAfter tasting those round cakes, I just knew it was your young lady\u2019s idea. Since Sanlang isn\u2019t at home, you probably don\u2019t have much to do in your estate. Come to the Zheng Estate with your grandmother some other time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was slightly surprised. She hadn\u2019t thought that Old Duchess Zheng would take the initiative to give her an invite to her estate. In the original story, this old madam was like a hermit. She would only socialise with the few madams she had befriended in her younger days.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian turned to Matriarch He. For a matter like this, it was better for Matriarch He to make the decision for her as the senior member of her family.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He was very satisfied with Chu Lian\u2019s action. She playfully rebuked her old friend, \u201cI think you just want to taste my granddaughter-in-law\u2019s culinary skills for yourself. Inviting her to have some fun is just a pretense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Old Duchess Zheng and Matriarch He had already been close friends for a few decades, when she heard Matriarch He exposing her ploy, she still blushed a little.</p><br/><p>She sighed lightly, \u201cI\u2019m not going to hide things from you. I\u2019ve brought my daughter-in-law along with a request.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian found it strange. Duke Zheng had a very successful career and their only heir was in the Imperial College. In the coming Autumn Examinations, he would definitely be able to score in the higher ranks. It could be said that all things were going smoothly for House Zheng. Why then, did Old Duchess Zheng need to request help from Matriarch He?</p><br/><p>Even if she were to request for help, something that troubled House Zheng was likely something that Matriarch He wouldn\u2019t be able to help with. Although Matriarch He was highly regarded in their social circles and was even close friends with the Empress Dowager, she didn\u2019t have the power to interfere with the court.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a thought flashed through Chu Lian\u2019s mind, which rendered her speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo speak directly. As long as it\u2019s something within my means, I\u2019ll do my best to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Duchess Zheng shot a sideways look at Matriarch He and seemed a little tongue-tied. When the younger Duchess Zheng saw that her mother-in-law was too embarrassed to speak up, she helped her out by saying, \u201cMatriarch He, the matter is like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

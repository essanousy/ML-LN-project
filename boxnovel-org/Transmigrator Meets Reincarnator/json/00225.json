What he had written on that note wasn\u2019t flowery professions of love, but he had \u2018cried wolf\u2019 too many times, so no wonder Chu Lian didn\u2019t even want to look at it.</p><br/><p>The contents of that note were related to Chu Lian\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>Through some sheer luck, the normally idle Second Master of House Ying, Chu Qizheng, had somehow gotten a proper fifth-ranked position that was actually just a cushy job. Not only that, but he seemed to have gotten connected to the Pan Estate somehow.</p><br/><p>There was definitely something up considering how abnormal this situation was. Xiao Bojian had just wanted to inform Chu Lian of this news and ask if she had any idea what was going on. Unfortunately, that little paper note had already gone up in flames.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Bojian noticed that his fists had clenched at some point, he realised that he was starting to lose his patience.</p><br/><p>The Autumn Examinations!</p><br/><p>This year, no one was going to stop him. He had borne with so much for ten years, all for the sake of finally showing off his brilliance in court. He was definitely going to become the person standing at that peak!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian led her maidservants into Old Duke Zheng\u2019s bedroom. At this moment, Old Duchess Zheng and Matriarch He were both waiting for her in the outer room.</p><br/><p>When she heard someone report that Chu Lian had come back with the food, Old Duchess Zheng couldn\u2019t sit still any longer and she quickly stood up.</p><br/><p>Matriarch He gently reassured her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this old woman has faith in the cooking skills of Sanlang\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was actually more anxious than the two elderly women. She even had a little doubt in her heart. Was Old Duke Zheng really going to be cured with just a tasty meal?</p><br/><p>She was led to Old Duke Zheng\u2019s bedside. Some maidservants had already set up a small table next to the bed. Chu Lian took the box of food from Xiyan\u2019s hands and personally arranged the dishes one by one on the small table.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian glanced at the unconscious Old Duke Zheng and frowned. Her shiny black eyes darted about in thought before she spoke up in a soft and gentle tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cA superior man possesses extraordinary comprehension and intellect. His excellence within is displayed through his posture and actions without. To seek enlightenment from crabs, today we have offered up some crab in orange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cool of mid-autumn is when the taste of crabs and oranges are at their best. No wonder Old Duke Zheng has them in his thoughts. However, as a gourmand, Old Duke Zheng surely must have eaten many fresh crabs and quality oranges before. However, have you ever tried eating crabs and oranges together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis junior has a secret recipe here called stuffed orange with crab meat. With this method of cooking, you could say that the fragrance of oranges and the freshness of the crab have both been expressed fully. Fresh and fragrant, paired with five other types of seasonings. If you\u2019re not able to taste it in this life, then it would truly be a regret\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Chu Lian was describing the dish, she even opened up one of the stuffed oranges. The originally sealed aroma instantly drifted through the air and filled the room. The whole room was now brimming with a smell that was as fresh and fragrant as Chu Lian had described.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, her speech was so tempting that even Old Duchess Zheng and Matriarch He, as well as the imperial physician waiting on the side, had all secretly sniffed at the air and gulped down some saliva. Of course, this also had an effect on the bedridden old duke.</p><br/><p>Old Duke Zheng had still been in the midst of unconsciousness. Suddenly, his eyelids twitched and he opened up his wrinkled old eyes.</p><br/><p>Although his pupils seemed a little misty at first, they quickly turned sharper. His nose wrinkled up, as if detecting the smell of good food in the air.</p><br/><p>When he finally distinguished what that aroma was made of, his old eyes shone brightly. He struggled to sit up, shouting with a hoarse voice, \u201cQuick, quickly! Help me up!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

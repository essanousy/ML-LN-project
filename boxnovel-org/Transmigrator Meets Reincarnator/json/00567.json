He shot a look at his oblivious little woman and didn\u2019t deign to reply her question immediately. He waved one hand at the servants in the room in dismissal.</p><br/><p>Seeing the mood between the couple, Senior Servant Zhong understood what was going on. She bobbed towards He Changdi and Chu Lian before leading the two maidservants in the room away. She even considerately dismissed the maidservant who was supposed to be on the night shift.</p><br/><p>For some reason, now that only she and He Changdi were left in the room, Chu Lian felt that the atmosphere was a little strange. There was a certain tension in the air. Her throat was starting to become a little dry, so she lifted up the teacup in front of her to sip at some warm water.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early, why did you chase them all out? Do you have a lot of documents to go through? Don\u2019t you have to work on some every night? Aren\u2019t you going tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another twitch developed in He Sanlang\u2019s forehead. His wife was too good at ruining the mood.</p><br/><p>If not for fear of losing control, would he have gone to his study every night to clear his mind?</p><br/><p>Thinking of those painful days, He Changdi felt a pang of sympathy for himself.</p><br/><p>He dropped all pretenses of courtesy with Chu Lian and quickly walked up to her. He bent down and immediately had her entire body wrapped up in his arms. Without further ado, he made large strides towards their bed.</p><br/><p>Realisation finally dawned upon Chu Lian in an instant. Her face flushed tomato red and she thought of struggling. However, her body felt like it was on fire. There was a burning desire for He Changdi\u2019s affections in her heart\u2026</p><br/><p>He Changdi drew close to her reddened ear and bit onto her plump earlobe. His low voice had a hint of devilish temptation to it as he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m not going. I\u2019ll be keeping you company all night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s body had become extremely sensitive after drinking the nourishing tonic for so many days. She couldn\u2019t bear with his wanton teasing.</p><br/><p>As if a switch had suddenly been flipped, her body was starting to change.</p><br/><p>By the time He Changdi set her down gently on their bed, her mind had already turned foggy and her consciousness was fluctuating between the boundary of reason and desire.</p><br/><p>Tears had gathered at the corners of her eyes at some point, making her wide almond-shaped eyes even more alluring.</p><br/><p>She tried her best to hold on to her last shred of sanity to stem the tide of desire flooding through her body. Unfortunately, her efforts were futile.</p><br/><p>Even though her rationality had already been taken over, Chu Lian still cringed from her actions deep inside. She couldn\u2019t understand why she had changed so much. This unwanted change gave her a terrible sense of defeat.</p><br/><p>She whined and made her last struggle.</p><br/><p>He Changdi hovered above her, looking down at her discomfited expression from above. He finally sighed and reached out to stroke her flushed cheek gently. His other hand went behind her back to soothe her tensed nerves. \u201cLian,\u2019er, don\u2019t be scared. It\u2019s perfectly normal for you to feel this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s gentle voice managed to summon some of Chu Lian\u2019s wits back. She blinked at him in a dazed manner with tears in her eyes, as if urging him to continue his explanation.</p><br/><p>He lowered his head and placed a soft peck on her lips before whispering, \u201cSilly girl, didn\u2019t you realise that the tonic was making your body \u2018hotter\u2019? Did you think that \u2018fire\u2019 could be doused with just a few slices of pears or by soaking in cold water?\u201d</p><br/><p>His wife was just too cute.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s reaction to He Changdi\u2019s explanation was a stunned stare.</p><br/><p>She continued blinking her widened eyes without speaking.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang buried his head in the space between her neck and shoulder, trying unsuccessfully to hide his muffled laughter.</p><br/><p>He stopped his pretense of courtesy and plucked off the thin nightclothes on Chu Lian with an agile twist of his hand.</p><br/><p>After waiting for so long, He Sanlang had already reached his limits. His feast was already bared before his eyes. There was no turning back now!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

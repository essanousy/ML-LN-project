He hadn\u2019t expected the truth to be so absurd. However, Chu Lian\u2019s tone had been even and sincere, so it didn\u2019t seem like she was lying.</p><br/><p>His memories from his past had also corroborated Chu Lian\u2019s words. Xiao Bojian did indeed have some sort of power backing him. He Changdi had been exiled in his past life and he had entered the army under a pseudonym later on. Despite living far away from the capital and not knowing anything of the situation there, he had still managed to use his limited influence to investigate major events.</p><br/><p>A dangerous glint came to life in his eyes as he narrowed his gaze.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bojian\u2026 He was going to take back every debt owed to him and let him have a taste of his suffering from his past life.</p><br/><p>He Changdi quickly pulled himself away from his dark thoughts and stared at Chu Lian for a few seconds, \u201cThe letter that Fuyan gave me was something passed to her during Old Marquis Dingyuan\u2019s birthday banquet. Xiao Bojian sent a messenger to pass the letter to you, but Fuyan kept it instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden mention of the letter stunned Chu Lian for an instant. She wanted to cry out loud. What was going on? She hated Xiao Bojian so much that she never ever wanted to see him again, yet the events around her seemed to be connecting the two of them together no matter what.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this the plight of being the protagonist of the story? If He Changdi was even the slightest bit dumber, their relationship might really have been destroyed by this.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian looked up and met his shadowed gaze, \u201cHe Sanlang, you believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi frowned deeply, \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Chu Lian\u2019s lips tugged into a pout. She turned her gaze away and refused to speak.</p><br/><p>He Changdi lifted her chin first before raising his upper body to lean over and plant a gentle kiss on her lips. He softened his tone and coaxed, \u201cWhat should you call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t understand how their open and frank conversation had somehow turned into a flirtatious scene. The two of them were just too close together now. Her exhales were blowing directly over his slightly exposed collarbones. Chu Lian couldn\u2019t help but flush in response to the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me Hubby.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s low and magnetic voice resounded beside Chu Lian\u2019s ears, raising goosebumps all over Chu Lian\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Since she was still trapped in the circle of He Changdi\u2019s arms, she could only give in. She bit her bottom lip before letting out a frustrated huff, \u201cHubby!\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint smile finally appeared on He Changdi\u2019s lips. He tugged with the arm around Chu Lian\u2019s waist, pulling Chu Lian into his embrace and enveloping her body with his own, forming a protective cage around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be better if you use a gentler tone next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian raised a brow, \u201cHe Sanlang! You\u2019re still picking on my tone?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi rested his chin on the top of Chu Lian\u2019s head. As low laughter rang out from above her, Chu Lian could feel the vibrations of his chest. Before she had the chance to enjoy the warm moment, his palm landed a sound smack on her pert bottom.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already forgotten what I just taught you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The abrupt switch from their serious conversation into perverted flirting caught Chu Lian off guard. That one smack made her cover her bottom instinctively as she trembled with indignation. Her next reaction was to push He Changdi away and glare at him.</p><br/><p>He Changdi reached out to stroke her back as if soothing an alarmed kitten.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er, I believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian took in a deep breath to gather all the fury rising within her and quickly bit down hard on his exposed collarbone.</p><br/><p>Afraid that she would hurt her teeth on his tough skin, He Changdi purposely relaxed his muscles and let her do as she liked.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gnawed on He Sanlang\u2019s collarbone until all her anger had been spent. Despite her best efforts, all she managed to leave in the end was two faint rows of tiny tooth marks. She hadn\u2019t even drawn any blood and had instead made her jaw ache from all the effort.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When he recalled that his two older brothers were still sleeping in the outer court, he lifted Chu Lian up from the bathtub and covered her snugly with his large sleep shirt. He carried her over to the bed and set her down.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang petted her smooth hair, \u201cLian\u2019er, you should sleep first. I\u2019m going to take a look at the outer court.\u201d</p><br/><p>He quickly changed into a fresh set of clothes. As he was about to leave, he found that Chu Lian had also changed into a normal dress. She tugged at his sleeve, \u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi hesitated for a moment before taking her hand. As they passed the changing screen, he swiped up a brocade cloak with a fox fur hood and put it on Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>The couple took some servants with them as they rushed over to the main study.</p><br/><p>Right as they left the inner court, the family soldiers who were on night duty came over to meet them.</p><br/><p>It was Huang Zhijian who was on duty tonight. He and the four young guards behind him bowed in greeting towards He Changdi and Chu Lian, \u201cThird Young Master, is anything the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang cast an indifferent glance over Huang Zhijian, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the main study in the outer court.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Zhijian didn\u2019t question him and quietly followed behind the two masters with the other guards.</p><br/><p>From the outside, the main study was shrouded in darkness. Only a single row of dim lanterns lit up the corridors.</p><br/><p>Huang Zhijian could sense that something was wrong. There should have been at least a few manservants on guard outside the main study at this time of night, yet there were none\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if there wasn\u2019t anyone using the main study, there would be two or three manservants on duty inside. They would rest in the side rooms of the study at night and keep watch over the valuable books and items within the study.</p><br/><p>There were two of their masters sleeping in the study right now, but there wasn\u2019t a single servant outside!</p><br/><p>He Changdi paused for a moment in the corridor outside the main study. He was about to push open the doors to enter, but he realised that the doors had been locked from the inside. He immediately kicked the doors open and took Chu Lian with him as they strode into the section on the left.</p><br/><p>There were two smaller rooms here, with entrances facing each other. He Changdi had been sleeping in the west one at first, while He Erlang was sleeping in the one to the east. When they entered the east room and realised that there was no one inside, they checked the west room and found that Erlang was sleeping soundly within. His clothes were still the same as before, so He Changdi relaxed.</p><br/><p>Following that, He Changdi and Chu Lian headed over to the section on the right of the study.</p><br/><p>When he tried to open the door, he found that the room had been locked from the inside!</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s first reaction was to kick in the doors again. A twitch developed in Chu Lian\u2019s eyes as she watched her husband\u2019s violent actions.</p><br/><p>However, it was when they walked up to the bedchamber and shoved the curtains open that they sucked in gasps of surprise!</p><br/><p>The bed was a chaotic mess. Various items of clothing were strewn all over and there was the distinctive smell of sex in the air.</p><br/><p>Although the room wasn\u2019t lit, one of the guards behind them lifted his lantern, casting light upon the situation inside.</p><br/><p>The two naked bodies lying on the bed\u2026 were He Dalang and Pan Nianzhen!</p><br/><p>Everything had happened so abruptly that Pan Nianzhen only started to awaken after He Changdi kicked down the doors. Her head was aching so much it felt like it was being pierced by a thousand silver needles.</p><br/><p>When she opened her eyes to see He Changdi fully dressed beside the bed, with icy cold eyes directed towards her, her body immediately froze up. The expression on her face slowly collapsed into despair.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hated the way Pan Nianzhen was looking at He Changdi, so she stepped forward to block her husband from her gaze.</p><br/><p>The moment Pan Nianzhen caught sight of Chu Lian, she finally lost control of her emotions and let out a high-pitched wail.</p><br/><p>Following Pan Nianzhen\u2019s scream, the lights of lanterns flared to life all over the previously dark Jing\u2019an Estate. It was going to be a sleepless night for House Jing\u2019an.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

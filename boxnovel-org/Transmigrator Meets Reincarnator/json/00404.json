He couldn\u2019t pull away even if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang kissed Chu Lian gently. His breathing became hurried. For some reason, those obscene drawings that Xiao Hongyu had kept in their tent suddenly floated up into his mind. His hands were already slowly climbing up to the soft peaks on Chu Lian\u2019s chest\u2026</p><br/><p>A strange feeling washed over him when he finally reached that new land. Every fibre of his being drew taut with tension.</p><br/><p>He swallowed hard. Even though his expression was as cool as ever, his eyes had darkened into fathomless pools.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had always been more aloof than most. Due to the tragedy he had experienced in his past life, his personality had become even more stoic and unfeeling.</p><br/><p>It was hard to move the heart of someone like that. However, the moment they fell in love, they fell hard.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang stared at Chu Lian with eyes as deep as the star-filled skies above.</p><br/><p>He was uncomfortably tensed all over and his mouth was dry. The hand he had placed over that soft lump finally started moving a little.</p><br/><p>That novel sensation finally pushed He Sanlang over the edge of no return.</p><br/><p>He had never known that his wife\u2019s body was so soft to the touch. Compared to her, he was hard all over and definitely not as nice to touch. He was really a dumb rock of a man.</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s neck was also slowly turning red. Despite that, he continued maintaining a cool and aloof expression his face. Only the heavens knew how excited and stirred up he was inside.</p><br/><p>His long black eyelashes trembled as his eyes focused on the unconscious Chu Lian. The movement of his hand paused as well. However, he couldn\u2019t bear to let go of that amazingly plush feeling under his palm, so he kept it there and even spread his fingers to dominate the whole area.</p><br/><p>After freezing for an agonising few seconds and making sure that Chu Lian was still sleeping and had no consciousness of what he was doing, his palm started moving again. Now that he was reassured that she hadn\u2019t woken up, he became even bolder.</p><br/><p>He gently kneaded the area under his hand before realising that he wanted even more. Finally, he let go of his restraint and reached his entire hand in to cover her breast. As if testing it out, he pinched the entire handful before groping it. He found a little nub standing out from the rest of the smooth skin under his palm.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang\u2019s lips were already pressed into a thin line. Sweat had started appearing on his palms. After a slight pause, he reached out with one finger to touch that raised spot in the middle.</p><br/><p>It seemed like that area was too sensitive and couldn\u2019t withstand any sort of teasing. It started changing rapidly\u2026</p><br/><p>The natural reaction from Chu Lian\u2019s body acted like a catalyst, causing a strange sensation to arise from He Sanlang\u2019s own body.</p><br/><p>In the dimly lit warm pen, the lantern hung on the side swayed with the movement of the snowboat, casting a warm and romantic light over the tiny little pen.</p><br/><p>Even a man as aloof as He Sanlang wouldn\u2019t be able to keep an iron hold over his control when faced with the woman he liked.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Chu Lian was his lawfully wedded wife. It was only natural for a husband to be intimate with his wife.</p><br/><p>Now that He Sanlang had found an excuse for his lapse of control, his movements became even bolder.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t enough for him to cope a feel with his hand alone now. He wanted to see exactly what he was touching.</p><br/><p>His eyes glanced down at Chu Lian\u2019s pale face, touched with a flush of red. He pulled his rebellious hand out from her clothes reluctantly.</p><br/><p>He left another gentle kiss on Chu Lian\u2019s forehead before he reached towards the ties keeping her clothes together. Shifting back a little gave him more space to maneuver about so that one of his hands could work to undo the ties on Chu Lian\u2019s inner clothing.</p><br/><p>Perhaps due to his nerves or his sense of urgency, he wasn\u2019t able to untie her clothes no matter how much he tried. Not only that, since he had pulled hard at the ties in a fit of frustration, the originally loose knot had turned into a dead one\u2026</p><br/><p>The tips of He Sanlang\u2019s ears turned even redder and his breathing turned into heavy pants. In the end, he lost all patience and used his internal energy to break the tie completely\u2026</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s gaze landed on the sliver of fair skin exposed from the loose collar of Chu Lian\u2019s clothes, where her pretty collarbones stood out under her slender neck. His eyes slid further downwards to the area where his hand had wandered to.</p><br/><p>Her clothes were still keeping everything under wraps, but the pressure of lying down sideways had pushed the two round buns on her chest together, making an enticing valley.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang picked up one side of her inner robe with his fingers; his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he gulped hard.</p><br/><p>The halter top that Chu Lian wore as underwear had become skewed from his movements earlier. Despite his usual blockhead appearance, He Changdi simply untied the strings at the back and gently tossed it to one side without any pause.</p><br/><p>Thus, the soft and tender buns that had just been in his palm were revealed to his sight.</p><br/><p>His gaze was now affixed to Chu Lian\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Looking at them was completely different from holding them blindly in his hand. The visual impact caused He Sanlang\u2019s body to tense up to its maximum. He had never thought that the two little buns on Chu Lian\u2019s chest would be so cute.</p><br/><p>He was almost trembling with how taut he was holding his body. Although he knew he shouldn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t restrain himself anymore. He reached out to rub one of the soft peaks.</p><br/><p>The moment his fingers touched her smooth skin, he couldn\u2019t hold back his strength.</p><br/><p>His slightly cool lips rained kisses on Chu Lian\u2019s forehead, then her nose, as he headed further downwards.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was completely immersed in enjoying the sensations overwhelming his body.</p><br/><p>The one thing he couldn\u2019t have expected was Chu Lian waking right this moment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When he saw the beef jerky he had been longing for day and night within, his eyeballs almost fell out with how wide he opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lucky brat! It\u2019s not safe out here in the northern border, make sure your family\u2019s soldiers protect Sister-in-Law properly.\u201d Zhang Mai immediately tore open the oil paper packaging wrapped around the beef jerky.</p><br/><p>He Changdi kept a serious expression on his face as he said, \u201cBrother Zhang, you\u2019re older than me by a whole generation. It\u2019s not really appropriate for you to call her Older Sister-in-Law like Hongyu does!\u201d</p><br/><p>After so many years spent in the army, Zhang Mai was already as thick-skinned as he could possibly get. How would He Changdi\u2019s mild provocation bother him? He chuckled and said, \u201cHe Sanlang, you have a higher ranking position than me now, so it\u2019s proper for me to call your wife Older Sister-in-Law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo and Zhang Mai sat down by He Changdi\u2019s bedside, munching happily on the goods they had been given.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu was rather sharp-eyed. His brows drew together as he suddenly recalled what he had seen while getting carried in on a stretcher.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Guo, did my eyes deceive me? I seemed to have seen a woman while I was being carried in just now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xiao Hongyu mentioned that, Captain Guo and Zhang Mai abruptly stopped wolfing down their food and let out similar constipated expressions, as if they had been forced to swallow a few kilograms of flies\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, her\u2026\u201d Captain Guo scratched his head. He didn\u2019t know how to explain this. That female general had just arrived in the camp two days ago. Furthermore, she seemed to be trusted by General Qian.</p><br/><p>When Zhang Mai saw that Captain Guo didn\u2019t know how to explain, he cut in. \u201cZixiang, Hongyu, you guys should have heard of the Sima family, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi, who lived in the capital and socialised in noble society, knew a little more than Xiao Hongyu did.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Simas should be\u2026 that rich and influential family in Shandong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai nodded and continued speaking. \u201cThe Simas of Shandong have been around for thousands of years and can be traced back to the Great Xia Dynasty. In the last dynasty, there were plenty of Simas working as court officials. Later on, when this new dynasty was founded, the Simas of Shandong started moving away from politics. Some people say that it\u2019s because the Simas lost too many talents during the changing of the dynasties. Others say that it\u2019s because the Simas don\u2019t want to stand out too much during the early stages of this dynasty, so they\u2019re hiding their abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai paused before continuing again. \u201cThat female general you saw today, she\u2019s called Sima Hui. She\u2019s from one of the Sima\u2019s branch families. Although you might not recognise her name, you should have heard of Sima Feng at least, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu replied first. \u201cOf course I know about Sima Feng! He was one of the border generals of the previous dynasty. Unfortunately, he was betrayed by his most trusted adjutant in the end and died at the feet of the Russians. He passed away filled with hatred.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Mai nodded in agreement. \u201cThat Sima Hui in our camp, she\u2019s Sima Feng\u2019s legitimate granddaughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu was so shocked that his jaw had dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually one of Old General Sima\u2019s descendants?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs far as I know, the main branch of the Simas didn\u2019t support Sima Feng at all. They even fought with Sima Feng\u2019s branch of the family. All of Sima Feng\u2019s male descendants entered the army and most of them died on the battlefields. By the time it reached Sima Hui\u2019s generation, there were only the old, weak, women and children left. Sima Hui practically grew up in the army. Without caring about her family\u2019s objections, she bravely enlisted in the army. This time, she was the one who brought the Shandong troops over as support.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu\u2019s cheeks were a little flushed from embarrassment. \u201cSo that girl turned out to be so impressive\u2026 I\u2019ve underestimated her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although He Changdi\u2019s expression was calm, his mind was racing. He hadn\u2019t participated in the war against the Tuhuns in his past life, and he hadn\u2019t heard of someone like Sima Hui before, either. Had the natural course of events changed, or were there other secrets behind this anomaly?</p><br/><p>Captain Guo harrumphed. \u201cDon\u2019t judge her for being a woman. She\u2019s one of the fiercest generals in our army. She\u2019s already led soldiers for five to six years, and she\u2019s more experienced than a greenhorn like you. General Qian trusts her ability enough to place her in important positions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shape of Zhang Mai\u2019s mouth suddenly formed into a slight leer. \u201cMost importantly, General Sima has specially formed a female camp; there are hundreds of female soldiers there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Hongyu\u2019s eyes were about to pop out. \u201cWhat?! Female soldiers? Women can be soldiers too? Don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re\u2026 Hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Guo gave a resounding smack to the back of Xiao Hongyu\u2019s head. \u201cGeneral Sima\u2019s female camp was made at the personal order of the Emperor himself! Stop having all these dirty thoughts in your head all the time! If you lose to that group of female soldiers in the battle against the Tuhuns, I\u2019m going to break your legs!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu\u2019s shoulders immediately shrunk upon being chastised.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo glared at Xiao Hongyu for good measure before turning to He Changdi. \u201cOne more thing, General Qian has given orders for you and Hongyu to investigate the area where you met the Tuhuns in the forest. You have to keep this mission a secret- both that its been given to you and that you\u2019re doing it. You can\u2019t leave camp too many times, as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was a little surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected Great General Qian to have entrusted this matter to him. It seemed like the events in the commander\u2019s tent earlier had just been a show that the general had put on for outsiders.</p><br/><p>Captain Guo and Zhang Mai stayed in He Sanlang\u2019s tent for an hour. As they left, they even forcefully snatched away half of the food that Chu Lian had given to He Sanlang.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hongyu took pleasure in his loss while lying on the bed next to his. \u201cHehe, Brother He. Luckily, I was already prepared for that. I\u2019ve already hidden all the goodies that Sister-in-Law gave me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

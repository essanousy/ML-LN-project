The one thing she couldn\u2019t stand the most was to see Chu Lian living better than she was.</p><br/><p>In the past, she had always been able to come out above \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 in the Ying Estate. She had also caused \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 to suffer much in secret. However, the gap between them seemed to have widened incredibly fast after Chu Lian had gotten married.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian had the extremely profitable Guilin Restaurant in her pockets, yet she still had to ask for her parents\u2019 permission to buy an accessory. It wasn\u2019t even a given that they would give their approval either.</p><br/><p>Although Chu Lian was already married, Brother Xiao was still thinking about her. He couldn\u2019t forget her.</p><br/><p>Even her husband\u2019s family was superior to House Ying. Her husband had gained merit at the northern border and had been bestowed the title of Marquis Anyuan. They were clearly both daughters of the second branch, but Chu Lian had already become a marchioness without any notice while she remained a nobody!</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan couldn\u2019t accept this massive gap between them.</p><br/><p>They had come from the same roots, so how could Chu Lian be doing so much better than her! Even Prince Wei\u2019s Estate held her in high esteem!</p><br/><p>She had invited Chu Lian over today with the intention to humiliate her. There was a huge difference between their coming of age ceremonies after all.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the grandeur of her ceremony, Chu Lian would definitely recall how her own had been so plain and half-hearted.</p><br/><p>Even so, Miss Yuan was still unsatisfied in her heart.</p><br/><p>He Changdi had official business to take care of, yet had had still personally escorted Chu Lian to the Ying Estate. Wasn\u2019t Chu Lian trying to show off her position in House Jing\u2019an and He Sanlang\u2019s current merits?</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan wrung the handkerchief in her hand with a wretched expression on her face. Her heart was filled with resentment.</p><br/><p>The only advantage that Chu Lian had over her was her looks alone!</p><br/><p>Xiaoqin noticed the grim expression on Eighth Miss and how she was silently biting her lips, obviously deep in her thoughts. She waved her hand to signal the reporting maidservant to retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cEighth Miss?\u201d Xiaoqin probed with a call.</p><br/><p>Miss Yuan came back to her senses and took in a deep breath to suppress the monstrous jealousy within her heart.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan sent a look at Xiaoqin, who immediately understood what she wanted. The handmaid stealthily left the courtyard while no one was paying attention.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan stared at her reflection in the mirror. A corner of her lips curved upwards, forming a sinister smile on her young face.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian, so you think you\u2019re living better than me? I\u2019ll destroy your reputation and completely ruin you!</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was known to be an upright and honest man who was also crazily devoted to his wife. She really wanted to know if he would still want Chu Lian once he sees what she\u2019s really like!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was invited into the inner court by one of the old madam\u2019s handmaids.</p><br/><p>All the womenfolk of the Ying Estate were currently there.</p><br/><p>When \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 had been a young miss of House Ying, she had rarely met the old madam. Yet the old madam was currently holding Chu Lian\u2019s hand and asking about her life in a warm and caring manner.</p><br/><p>The aunts from the other branches who had looked down on House Ying\u2019s Sixth Miss in the past were also acting thoughtful and attentive towards her now.</p><br/><p>She had already married into the Jing\u2019an Household for more than half a year. The question that these two-faced relatives asked the most was whether there had been any news from her belly.</p><br/><p>Amongst them, a particular aunt-in-law\u2019s words were the most unpleasant to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe women of our Chu family are all very fertile. Miss Lian, take a look at how your married sisters have fared. All of them have given birth to sons, so you mustn\u2019t bring shame to our Chu family.\u201d</p><br/><p>While it sounded as if she was urging Chu Lian to become pregnant as quickly as possible, it was actually a sarcastic remark about Chu Lian having been able to marry into the Jing\u2019an Estate due to this absurd stereotype. Furthermore, she had only managed to turn her life around all thanks to that enviable windfall.</p><br/><p>In addition, she was also mocking her for not being pregnant yet.</p><br/><p>This group of women were definitely mad with jealousy over Chu Lian\u2019s current status, so it was inevitable that they would say such unpleasant words.</p><br/><p>However, they only dared to do so because Chu Lian\u2019s position wasn\u2019t high enough. If Chu Lian\u2019s status reached a certain level, then these women wouldn\u2019t dare to speak up at all.</p><br/><p>A good example would be the eldest princess royal of the previous dynasty, the sister to the Emperor, Princess Royal Chaoyang. Though she had never borne any children in her lifetime, she was considered a heroine. She led a hundred thousand elite soldiers to defend against the rebellion of Prince Huai\u2019an and protected the position of the imperial family. Chaoyang was then bestowed the title of Protector Princess Royal.</p><br/><p>Princess Royal Chaoyang and her husband, Princess Consort Qu, never had any children throughout their lives, but the Qu family had never dared to have any complaints. Matriarch Qu had even advised her son not to take any concubines.</p><br/><p>Although the people now were uncertain about whether Princess Consort Qu and Princess Royal Chaoyang truly loved each other, it remained a fact that Princess Consort Qu had never taken a concubine despite Princess Chaoyang being barren. That was enough to prove his love for her.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian sat beside the old madam with a faint smile. She didn\u2019t deign to reply to the rude aunt-in-law\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The old madam held her hand with a kind expression on her face, \u201cMiss Lian, your aunt\u2019s words may be somewhat unpleasant, but they\u2019re true. You\u2019ve been married to Marquis Anyuan for nearly half a year. Why hasn\u2019t there been any news? This isn\u2019t good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian hadn\u2019t thought that the entire House Ying would be eyeing her stomach.</p><br/><p>She was only sixteen right now, so it would still be considered too early for her to get pregnant even by normal means!</p><br/><p>Her third aunt-in-law, seated further down on the right side, seemed to have thought of something. Her eyes turned from side to side suspiciously, before she smiled at Chu Lian and said, \u201cMiss Lian, our Miss Fu is turning fourteen this year. Her coming of age ceremony will be held the very next year. You should also know that your Third Aunt-in-law is very fertile. Miss Fu has three older brothers! If there\u2019s still no news from your belly a few months later, it wouldn\u2019t be good to let things drag on!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Therefore, Princess Leyao wasn\u2019t the typical sheltered princess. She had learned to ride at a very young age, and having been trained by the emperor, she was in fact pretty skilled, and was in a different league from a newbie like Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>However, even if she possessed exceptional riding ability, that wasn\u2019t enough to gloss over the fact that her body was still that of a child.</p><br/><p>When she rode horses, she had always been given a very tame and gentle mare, but she had gotten on a horse meant for hunting, an unruly stallion. Due to her frame, she couldn\u2019t control such a spirited adult stallion no matter how skillful she was, so it only made sense that the emperor would worry.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s brows were immediately pressed against each other, \u201cYuanzhou, take two men with you and find Leyao. Send her back to be confined to Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s side!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuanzhou was the name of the guard who reported this matter. After accepting the order, he was about to turn around, but he suddenly heard Princess Leyao\u2019s young voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor lifted one hand to stop the guard who was about to leave. He waited on the spot with everyone for Princess Leyao\u2019s arrival, a thunderous expression on his face. Sure enough, Princess Leyao appeared moments later.</p><br/><p>The way she rode the hunting stallion over made everyone sweat buckets from worry.</p><br/><p>Princess Leyao had obviously noticed them as well. She smiled and waved at the emperor, \u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor now had a headache.</p><br/><p>Princess Leyao was still some distance away, but the emperor couldn\u2019t help reprimanding her, \u201cPreposterous! Who let you come? You\u2019re looking nothing like a lady!\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Leyao seemed to have predicted such words from the emperor, so she raised her chin at Sima Hui\u2019s direction, \u201cFather, General Sima is a lady as well, yet she\u2019s allowed to be here. You\u2019re being sexist!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor hadn\u2019t expected Princess Leyao to refute him like this, and it made his rage swell up even more.</p><br/><p>Right as Princess Leyao\u2019s horse was about to reach the emperor\u2019s side, her horse suddenly reared up. It then started to flail around randomly like it had gone mad\u2026</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cProtect the princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amongst the people that were in the vicinity, the closest ones were He Changdi and Royal Prince Lu Tai.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t see what had happened, but it was obvious that Princess Leyao had lost control of her horse.</p><br/><p>Due to this abrupt development, Princess Leyao herself started screaming in fright.</p><br/><p>She had only ever ridden gentle mares, so she had never encountered a situation where she completely lost control of her horse. In the end, she showed that she was still a child when her face paled and she subconsciously screamed.</p><br/><p>Even He Changdi, a reincarnated person, didn\u2019t have the time to decide whether to save her or not.</p><br/><p>At a crucial time like this, there was simply no time for them to weigh their gains and losses.</p><br/><p>He Changdi and Lu Tai both urged their horses towards Princess Leyao.</p><br/><p>Everyone watched the dangerous scene nervously, and there was so much tension in the air that their hearts skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s eyes remained wide, and he held his breath.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, He Changdi, Lu Tai, and the other guards were still too slow\u2026</p><br/><p>After all, they were too far away and distant waters couldn\u2019t put out a nearby fire.</p><br/><p>Before He Changdi and Lu Tai could get to her, Princess Leyao had already been flung off the horse.</p><br/><p>The stallion was strong and spirited, while Princess Leyao was merely an eleven-year-old child. Getting flung off a horse like that, even if she survived, she would probably be crippled\u2026</p><br/><p>A high-pitched neigh came from the stallion right before it fell to the ground, stirring up a small cloud of dust.</p><br/><p>The horse had been slaughtered by He Changdi with a single stroke. It had already gone mad. If he hadn\u2019t beheaded it, it might have ended up trampling on Princess Leyao who had fallen to the side.</p><br/><p>Everyone hastily rushed over.</p><br/><p>Lu Tai carefully held Princess Leyao up. He didn\u2019t make any sudden moves, for fear that it might worsen any injury that she had sustained.</p><br/><p>The emperor anxiously rushed to Lu Tai\u2019s side, \u201cYao\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if Princess Leyao\u2019s character had become more displeasing to him, she was still the daughter the emperor doted on the most. Right now, his daughter had gotten hurt before his eyes, so there was no way he could keep his cool.</p><br/><p>Hearing the emperor\u2019s shout, Princess Leyao seemed to have returned to her senses from her shock of getting thrown off the horse. She looked towards the emperor\u2019s direction, and began to cry loudly, \u201cFather, Father! I\u2019m scared! It hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor felt the pain of his heart being wrenched. The smart and wise ruler was at a loss for what to do when faced with the cries of his youngest daughter.</p><br/><p>He could only come up with an awkward attempt at consolation, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Yao\u2019er, I\u2019m here with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he roared at the top of his lungs for the imperial physicians.</p><br/><p>The imperial physicians were always brought along for the spring hunt, as minor injuries were commonplace during the hunts. However, the imperial physicians never followed them out on hunts in the forest, and they were currently still at the campsite.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He then gently caressed the smooth skin at her waist.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s mind was churning at lightning speed.</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t well-versed in the bureaucratic system of the Great Wu Dynasty, she still knew a little.</p><br/><p>The system used in the Great Wu Dynasty was pretty much the same as the Ming Dynasty from history.</p><br/><p>Back in the Ming Dynasty, there were four official departments recognised by all as the most lucrative: the Ministry of Personnel\u2019s Departments of Administration and Examinations and the Ministry of War\u2019s Departments of Appointments and Logistics. He Changdi had just been given a position at one of these lucrative departments. Although his rank wasn\u2019t very high, he did hold actual authority. A fifth-ranked administrator like him could stand up to a first-ranked official with an empty post.</p><br/><p>Any military official would have to go through his department in order to get transferred to other posts.</p><br/><p>It was only when the large hand sneaking around in her clothes gradually reached up and touched the ties holding her underclothes closed that she finally returned to her senses.</p><br/><p>She pulled down He Sanlang\u2019s misbehaving hands and glared at him.</p><br/><p>Feeling a little speechless, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be facing trouble soon, how do you still have the mood to play around? What do you think His Majesty\u2019s intentions are? Your achievements at the northern border are already eye-catching on their own and the bestowal of your marquisate is unprecedented. Why would he still give you a position like this? Isn\u2019t this practically drawing a target on your back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chengping Emperor was playing a game of chess here, but doesn\u2019t he know that tall trees attract the woodman\u2019s axe?</p><br/><p>Bestowing a marquisate on He Sanlang and giving him a lucrative post, just what was the Emperor trying to do?</p><br/><p>He Changdi had only been mentioning this to Chu Lian off-handedly. He hadn\u2019t expected her to have read so deeply into it.</p><br/><p>So this little woman who normally only thought of how to eat better actually knew how to navigate the twists and turns in the imperial court. He had truly underestimated her in the past.</p><br/><p>At this point of time, Chu Lian was like a great treasure that had been discovered in the mud and He Sanlang was the one who had discovered her. Each time he found out how different she was, it felt as if his treasure had multiplied, he was both astonished and delighted.</p><br/><p>After recovering from his astonishment, he burst into a bout of open laughter, \u201cChu Lian, why aren\u2019t you happy that I\u2019ve gotten such a lucrative post? Why are you complaining about your husband\u2019s position instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian pushed at him, trying to break free from his embrace, but his muscular arms were like steel prongs, they simply refused to budge. She rolled her eyes at him, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi tightened his arms around her, \u201cDon\u2019t move, let me hug you for a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he rested his head back on Chu Lian\u2019s shoulder. Chu Lian assumed that he was trying to think, so she stopped struggling and stayed still.</p><br/><p>A good while later, He Changdi said, \u201cXiao Bojian has gone to the Ministry of Personnel. Although he isn\u2019t in the Department of Administration, it\u2019s still an important position.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Changdi\u2019s words made Chu Lian stiffen up as she found this hard to believe.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, then she found it even harder to understand the Chengping Emperor\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, in this life, Xiao Bojian was actually climbing up the ranks quicker than he had in the book!</p><br/><p>It had to be emphasised that in the original book, it was with the help of \u2018Chu Lian\u2019 along with House Ying\u2019s full support that he jad managed to enter the Ministry of Personnel one year from now.</p><br/><p>Who could have thought that his rise would be so much faster this time!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian was in He Changdi\u2019s embrace right now, so even though she hadn\u2019t made much movement, He Changdi detected the suble stiffening of her body. He raised his head to look at her and stared into her clear eyes.</p><br/><p>He Changdi still didn\u2019t understand her. After numerous tests, he had confirmed that Chu Lian wasn\u2019t interested in Xiao Wujing at all. Furthermore, her disinterest went further than that. She was actually disgusted by him.</p><br/><p>Yet whenever he mentioned Xiao Wujing, there would be an obvious and strange reaction from his wife. It didn\u2019t seem like she was completely ignorant of Xiao Wujing\u2019s plight. He Changdi\u2019s eyes darkened, he had a faint feeling that Chu Lian was concealing something from him.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t happy about that, if he turned to look at it from another perspective, he still had his whole lifetime ahead to spend with her. There was no need to worry that she would keep him in the dark forever.</p><br/><p>The couple cuddled for a while before Chu Lian urged He Changdi to take a bath and change out of his clothes.</p><br/><p>It was getting late and they still had to rush to Qingxi Hall for their reunion dinner.</p><br/><p>After he finished bathing, He Changdi donned a navy blue robe and a black cape with a qilin embroidered on the lower half. These were clothes that the estate had specially made for him this winter.</p><br/><p>He Changdi was a lot more well-built than before after training in the army. He had broad shoulders, a slim waist, and long muscular legs. He wasn\u2019t too slender and lanky, but he wasn\u2019t overly muscular and burly either.</p><br/><p>The robes complemented his tall and slightly muscular build perfectly.</p><br/><p>Even Chu Lian couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off him.</p><br/><p>When He Sanlang noticed her unending stare, a spark of delight flared up within him. However, his face remained as icy as ever. He even pretended to be indifferent as he said, \u201cHave you stared enough? If you have, then come and tie my hair for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t bother bickering with this weirdo and beckoned him over, \u201cCome on, sit over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Sanlang walked to the dressing table and sat down obediently like a good puppy. Chu Lian then picked up the sandalwood comb on the table and started combing and tying up his hair.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the simple hairstyle that Chu Lian had done was still passable. Once she stuck a white jade crown with a design that matched the hairpin she wore on his head, He Sanlang\u2019s poker face finally regained some colour.</p><br/><p>He glanced at his own image in the mirror, coughed twice, and managed to squeeze out some praise, \u201cNot too bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL Note: I couldn\u2019t find an official translation for the departments mentioned here, so I did some research on them and came up with approximate titles.</p><br/><p>So if you were an official in the Ming Dynasty, these are the four departments that are known to be lucrative posts. Why? It\u2019s because these were seen as easy jobs with the likelihood of bribes coming your way.</p><br/><p>Ministry of Personnel ()</p><br/><p>Department of Administration ()</p><br/><p>Department of Examinations ()</p><br/><p>Ministry of War ()</p><br/><p>Department of Appointments ()</p><br/><p>Department of Logistics ()</p><br/><p>I think it\u2019s quite clear why for the Departments of Examinations and Appointments, as you can bribe these officials to smooth your way through the ranks. Even for upstanding officials, it\u2019s standard to give gifts in celebration/gratitude for promotions, etc.</p><br/><p>The Department of Administration is in charge of improving bureaucratic processes. From my own perspective, maybe you could bribe officials to push for a certain process that\u2019s beneficial for you? *not a historian in any way lol*</p><br/><p>The Department of (War) Logistics is quite clear too, because war supplies would be a huge source of income for merchants. Some bribes going the way of the administrator could help you get that business. OwO</p><br/>\n</div>"}

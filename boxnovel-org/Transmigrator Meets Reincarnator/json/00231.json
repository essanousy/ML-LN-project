It lit a fuse in her, making her grit her teeth in frustration as she pointed a trembling finger at Fuyan\u2019s departing back. However, she didn\u2019t dare to scold Fuyan either. There were quite a few other maidservants outside, after all.</p><br/><p>In the end, Jingyan could only scold Fuyan in her mind for being a fake. Fuyan was clearly dead envious on the inside, but on the surface, she still acted like she could care less. What a fraud!</p><br/><p>What could they gain from staying here in the inner court of the Jing\u2019an Estate? Their young master was far off at the borders, and the main branch of this family wasn\u2019t close to theirs, either. The young master of the second branch only came back to the estate once or twice a month, so they didn\u2019t even have the chance to get close to him. Later on, when they came of suitable age, if Third Young Madam was happy with their service, she would bestow them to a steward of the estate. If she wasn\u2019t happy, then she might even marry them off to some menial manservant, to toil away for the rest of their days in poverty.</p><br/><p>Mingyan was so lucky to have met such a good chance. Even if she couldn\u2019t get into Heir Zheng\u2019s bed, she might be able to get married to a minor official instead and become an official\u2019s legitimate wife.</p><br/><p>As for her, she could only stay by Third Young Madam\u2019s side, toiling away her days in this Songtao Court. What kind of future could she have?</p><br/><p>Mingyan\u2019s sudden departure had caused all sorts of hidden thoughts to surface in Jingyan\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, as Fuyan continued walking towards the parlour, she kept up her calm exterior despite no longer being in front of Jingyan. But in reality, how could she not be boiling with jealousy of Mingyan?!</p><br/><p>However, there were other thoughts in her mind that kept her more patient than Jingyan.</p><br/><p>When she thought of He Changdi\u2019s outstanding figure and his handsome looks, as well as that strangely attractive cold demeanour and sombre air of his, Fuyan was filled with excitement. She was going to wait, no matter how many years it took. She was going to wait until the day that Third Young Master returned. With that letter in her hands, she was certain that she would be able to get Third Young Master\u2019s favour.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Chu Lian was lying in her soft bed, covered in a fragrant, light blanket. She was deep in a comforting slumber, without any mind to care about what the maidservants in her courtyard were thinking about.</p><br/><p>In the following days, Chu Lian was kept busy with the opening of Guilin Restaurant. Time flew by in the blink of an eye, and before they knew it, there was only one day left before the first of September, the day of Guilin Restaurant\u2019s reopening.</p><br/><p>Mingyan had already been left in the Zheng Estate to take care of Old Duke Zheng\u2019s meals for about six days.</p><br/><p>After eating the delicious food that Mingyan had personally cooked, Old Duke Zheng\u2019s spirit was back. In just a few days, he had already recovered to his usual state of health. By the fourth day, he was already able to get out of bed and move around. When it came to the sixth day, he could get up in the morning to practise the five-animal exercises of qigong.</p><br/><p>On this day, Heir Zheng had come over to his grandfather\u2019s courtyard early in the morning. Old Duke Zheng had just changed into a short-sleeved tunic and was about to do some morning exercise when he saw that his grandson had come to visit him. He cheerfully extended an invitation to him and said, \u201cTiancheng, come and practise some techniques with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon receiving his grandfather\u2019s invitation, Heir Zheng grinned widely, showing off his teeth. He immediately took off his outer robe and tossed it to his manservant. Then, he strode over to his grandfather\u2019s side and started practising some morning exercises with Old Duke Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat, why have you come over to grandfather\u2019s place so early in the morning? Are you here to steal a free meal?\u201d Old Duke Zheng harrumphed.</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng was a talkative one. \u201cGrandfather understands Grandson the most! But Grandson isn\u2019t here just to fulfill some simple appetite today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? What\u2019s the matter? Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Duke Zheng was full of energy. His punches were brimming with power. There was no trace of the man who had been on his deathbed just six days ago after almost starving to death.</p><br/><p>The power of gourmet food was really quite miraculous.</p><br/><p>\u201cHouse Jing\u2019an\u2019s Third Young Madam, otherwise known as Honoured Lady Jinyi, is about to open up a restaurant tomorrow. If Grandfather would like to go and take a look, Grandson happens to have two invites here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonoured Lady Jinyi is that girl who came to our estate with Matriarch He the other day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed she is. That favoured maidservant you have here was left behind by Honoured Lady Jinyi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat does sound interesting. Leave one invite for Grandfather then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng was so happy that even his eyebrows were beaming.</p><br/><p>After grandfather and grandson finished an hour of exercise together and took a shower, a senior servant entered the room to inform them that breakfast was ready.</p><br/><p>Old Duke Zheng brought his grandson to the parlour, where the table had been laid out with a variety of dishes. There were steamed rice cakes, flower rolls, steamed dumplings, fried breadsticks, and also some steaming hot pork porridge.</p><br/><p>They could the smell the tempting aroma of the food even from the entrance of the parlour. The two men were already starving, so they quickly walked right in and sat at the table.</p><br/><p>As Old Duke Zheng looked over the table laden with breakfast foods he had never seen before, a passionate fire seemed to be burning in his eyes. He shot a look at Mingyan, who was waiting by his side. \u201cMingyan, quick, tell me what all these are.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Old Duke Zheng spoke up, Heir Zheng turned to look at Mingyan, who was standing by the table. When Mingyan caught sight of Heir Zheng\u2019s gaze from the corner of her eyes, a faint blush covered her cheeks. However, she still managed to say, \u201cReplying to Old Duke Zheng and Heir Zheng, the plate over on that end contains a dish called \u2018Double Golden Spears\u2019. It\u2019s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mingyan\u2019s gentle voice resounded within the parlour, but as Heir Zheng continued listening, he sensed something wrong.</p><br/><p>Although this girl was introducing the dishes properly, there wasn\u2019t any mention of Honoured Lady Jinyi in her descriptions. By excluding her, Mingyan was trying to imply that she had been the one to invent all these dishes. How was that possible!</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng\u2019s brows furrowed together as he took another look at Mingyan. This time, Mingyan also turned to meet his gaze. Her eyes were flush with desire, like a soft autumn wind.</p><br/><p>Heir Zheng stiffened and quickly turned his gaze away.</p><br/><p>Of course, all these little interactions had fallen into Old Duke Zheng\u2019s sharp eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

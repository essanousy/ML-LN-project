Although she could feel that he absolutely despised her, except for the sudden strangling on their wedding night, he didn\u2019t seem like a threat, even though he had always given her a cold shoulder.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t the original Chu Lian, who was entirely too greedy. She also didn\u2019t care too much for Xiao Bojian. The current Chu Lian was someone who just wanted an easy life. Even though she didn\u2019t know why He Sanlang didn\u2019t like her, as long as he didn\u2019t obstruct her days of comfort, she would leave him alone.</p><br/><p>Since she had mysteriously come to this Great Wu Dynasty and had become a young madam of a noble family, then she would happily live her layabout life in bliss.</p><br/><p>As for He Changdi, she would leave him to his strange temper. What meaning would there be in getting angry at a little \u2018kid\u2019 throwing a tantrum?</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wished, the main kitchen has been burned down, but I bet you didn\u2019t expect that Eldest Sister-in-Law would be fine. I\u2019m afraid your plans have been foiled. Oh\u2026 I forgot to mention, I\u2019m afraid that Cook Zhou won\u2019t make it. Seems like you won\u2019t be able to eat the Jing\u2019an Household\u2019s signature sweets ever again!\u201d He Sanlang said mockingly.</p><br/><p>Back at Qingxi Hall, he had thought that Madam Zou had claimed that Chu Lian had saved her life in order to reassure Grandmother. He would have never believed that the culprit behind the fire would save his Sister-in-Law unless he saw it with his own two eyes!</p><br/><p>Chu Lian shook her head slightly. She really didn\u2019t know what was going on in this guy\u2019s head. Geez, was he paranoid or what?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even have the time to cook up some real good food. How would she have the time to plot and carry out a sinister scheme?</p><br/><p>Not to mention, this huge Jing\u2019an Estate had so many businesses under it. How could managing all of that be fun?</p><br/><p>She had no desire whatsoever to hold such a tiring post. Rather, she would leave that \u2018honour\u2019 to Sister-in-Law.</p><br/><p>She had worked her pants off in her previous life. Now that she had gotten such a once-in-a-lifetime chance, she was just going to laze her days away.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have to worry about hunting for a promotion, or paying mortgage. Even if she did nothing but cook scrumptious food and admire the scenery all day, she would still get a salary here. The salary was pretty hefty as well. Where else was she going to find such a perfect \u2018job\u2019?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t speak and rose from the chair, tidying up her slightly messy hair.</p><br/><p>Her head was slightly lowered and she was in poor light. Her face was cast in shadows, so her expression wasn\u2019t clear.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang thought that he had finally gotten one over her, and she was only hiding her frustration. Unfortunately for her, He Sanlang saw right through it and felt invariably smug. He would be happy as long as this wicked woman\u2019s plans didn\u2019t come to fruition.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, Chu Lian, I advise you to quit scheming while you still can. This isn\u2019t the Jing\u2019an Household of before! Your foxtail is showing\u2014you had better keep it tucked in, or else!\u201d He Changdi felt like he had gotten his point across, so he tossed his sleeves and walked away.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian stood up and watched him leave with her head tilted to one side. When she could no longer see his figure, she muttered to herself, \u201cThat loony!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since when had she had a foxtail?1 She only wanted to pass her days in peace, make good food, and raise her standard of living. That was it. But here he was, threatening her for no good reason!</p><br/><p>Was he even human?</p><br/><p>That was just a waste of his godly looks!</p><br/><p>How petty!</p><br/><p>He Changdi coldly walked out of the bedroom, scaring Senior Servant Gui, who was waiting by the door. She hurriedly greeted him, but he didn\u2019t even glance at her as he left for the study.</p><br/><p>He had just entered the corridor when he saw his servant, Laiyue, leading two maidservants into the courtyard.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang stopped and asked, \u201cWhere are you going in such a hurry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing his Master\u2019s tone, Laiyue knew that he wasn\u2019t in a very good mood. He didn\u2019t dare to dally and rushed to explain. \u201cThe Matriarch sent these maidservants over with dinner.\u201d After saying so, Laiyue moved aside, revealing the two maidservants, each holding an exquisitely decorated box of food.</p><br/><p>The mention of dinner made He Sanlang remember how Chu Lian\u2019s had immediately asked for food upon first waking up. His expression turned sour.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend it all to my study!\u201d He Changdi coldly ordered.</p><br/><p>Laiyue gaped before asking in a whisper, \u201cAh? Young Master, you\u2019re not going to eat in the parlour? The\u2026 the study isn\u2019t a place for eating\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Laiyue had finished speaking, he felt a sinisterly cold gaze land on his head. Thus, he hurriedly turned and instructed the maidservants behind him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear Young Master? Hurry up and go to the study!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two maidservants lowered their heads and exchanged looks. They couldn\u2019t understand what Third Young Master was trying to do, but they were just servants, so all they could do was obey.</p><br/><p>The two of them trembled in trepidation as they sent the food over to the study.</p><br/><p>Laiyue moved closer to He Changdi\u2019s side. \u201cYoung Master, there are also some fresh ingredients here. Where should we put them? Eldest Young Madam said that they would be a little busy tomorrow morning, and the food might be sent a bit later than usual. She sent each courtyard a package of ingredients just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>1.

Aggrieved, her voice came out nasally as she asked Chu Lian, \u201cThird Young Madam, what\u2019s this! Why is it so stinky? Has it gone bad on the way here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian giggled and took the basket from Wenlan\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not spoiled; it was like this from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wenlan didn\u2019t dare to stop pinching her nose. She stared at Chu Lian with wide, shocked eyes, unable to imagine how something so smelly could be food.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure this is still edible? It\u2019s all black and it smells terrible\u2026\u201d The smell alone was enough to drive anyone a thousand miles away in fear, let alone put it in their mouths.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian let out a mysterious smile. \u201cDon\u2019t judge things by their covers. Once you have a taste of this, you\u2019ll be hooked immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Wenlan didn\u2019t reply, still in disdain over the stinky tofu in the basket, the blatant curiosity in her eyes betrayed her.</p><br/><p>Wenlan watched as Third Young Madam earnestly washed her hands, as if she was really about to cook the stinky tofu. At the sight, Wenlan couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cThird Young Madam, perhaps you should save this dish for another time? We\u2019ve already prepared enough food for the meal today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t Old Duke Zheng faint if they served such a foul-smelling dish to him?</p><br/><p>Considering that the stinky tofu\u2019s smell really wasn\u2019t for everyone, Chu Lian thought for a bit before saying, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll just cook enough for myself then. Don\u2019t serve it to the tent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenqing and Wenlan hurriedly agreed.</p><br/><p>They had brought a specially made furnace with them. The furnace was fuelled by charcoal, and there was a custom-made steel wok on top of it.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian poured the oil she had prepared into the wok and heated it up. Now it was time to fry the stinky tofu.</p><br/><p>The stinky tofu had been chopped into blocks around the size of half her palm. She used a pair of chopsticks to place them carefully into the pool of oil.</p><br/><p>When the black tofu entered the golden oil, bubbles formed around the blocks. Soon, the tofu spread out and expanded. Once the outer layer was fried to a golden crisp, it was time to scoop it out.</p><br/><p>Since this was purely to satisfy her own cravings, Chu Lian only made a small dish of them, four pieces in total.</p><br/><p>She carefully placed the four black and gold pieces of stinky tofu onto a clean, white porcelain dish. Finally, she poured the sweet and spicy chilli paste she had prepared earlier over the tofu.</p><br/><p>Other than being a little stinky, the tofu actually looked rather delicious.</p><br/><p>The black mixed with red was visually appealing, and there was a certain fried fragrance to it as well.</p><br/><p>Wenlan stared with her mouth slightly agape at Chu Lian\u2019s familiar actions.</p><br/><p>She had thought that Chu Lian had just been kidding. Who could have expected that Third Young Madam would really use that disgusting stinky tofu as a dish? Somehow, it even looked good after plating\u2026</p><br/><p>For some reason, the strange smell billowing towards her gave her the urge to have a taste\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Lian didn\u2019t have any spare time to care about what Wenlan was thinking. She took up a clean pair of chopsticks and hurriedly picked up a piece of tofu. Then, she blew on it to cool it down before placing it into her mouth.</p><br/><p>The unique fragrance of stinky tofu spread across her taste buds. The moment she bit into it, the combination of the gentle taste of the tofu, the crispy exterior, the saltiness of the seasoning, the oil, as well as the spiciness of the chilli paste, brought a whole new kind of experience to her. That kind of taste could make anyone hooked by the first bite and leave them wanting for more.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian chewed happily with her cheeks slightly puffed like a hamster. The satisfaction of finally tasting her long-awaited craving made her eyes narrow with pleasure.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, it was clear whether someone enjoyed eating something just from their expressions alone.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian\u2019s expression right now showed exactly how much she was enjoying and savouring her food.</p><br/><p>Since she was already used to the modern world\u2019s standard of food, Chu Lian had always maintained a calm and normal expression while teaching the maidservants how to cook.</p><br/><p>Although the maidservants always exclaimed that the new dishes that Chu Lian had introduced to them were peerless, Chu Lian had never shown any particular reaction while tasting them.</p><br/><p>It made them feel as if Chu Lian had grown up eating such exquisite dishes all day.</p><br/><p>The handmaids serving Chu Lian always had a minor sense of defeat upon seeing their madam\u2019s calm.</p><br/><p>Thus, it was rare for them to see Third Young Madam\u2019s expression full of satisfaction and nostalgia while eating.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, the familiar taste of a certain dish could indeed evoke the joyful memories of the past.</p><br/><p>Stinky tofu was one such dish for Chu Lian.</p><br/><p>Once a single piece of stinky tofu had vanished down her gut, Chu Lian let out a small sigh of satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Wenlan couldn\u2019t help gulping down her drool while watching Chu Lian eat.</p><br/><p>She thought she must have been possessed. She hadn\u2019t even liked the smell of that black tofu earlier, so why did she suddenly have the urge to taste it?</p><br/><p>\u201cThird\u2026 Third Young Madam, what does it taste like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gestured towards the stove next to her with a curve of her lips. \u201cWon\u2019t you know if you taste it yourself?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

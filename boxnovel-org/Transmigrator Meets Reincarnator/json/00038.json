Chu Lian had already returned to the Ying Estate today, and had been surrounded by a group of women she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, and so hadn\u2019t eaten much today. By the time she had returned to the Jing\u2019an Estate, she was already starving. However, because of the fire, she had completely forgotten about her hunger. By now, her stomach was growling in protest.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian leaned against the couch, comedy book still in hand. She was bored while waiting for dinner time, so she had already showered and changed into her sleeping clothes. However, there was still no sign of dinner in sight.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t right! Her sister-in-law, Madam Zou, was the conscientious sort. The two of them hadn\u2019t eaten dinner yet, and Eldest Sister-in-Law couldn\u2019t have possibly forgotten about them. Not to mention, there was still Matriarch He\u2026</p><br/><p>On the day of the tea ceremony, Chu Lian had discovered that Matriarch He was really sweet on her youngest grandson.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian couldn\u2019t wait any longer. She shouted for Xiyan, who was in the outer chamber.</p><br/><p>Xiyan quickly walked in. \u201cThird Young Madam, do you have any orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ask and see if dinner has been sent over. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xiyan bobbed in acknowledgement, she went out to find out what happened to their meal. She returned as quickly as she left.</p><br/><p>While leaning against her red pillow as she read her comedy, Chu Lian casually asked, \u201cSo, how did it go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan had a conflicted expression on her face and didn\u2019t know what to say. After a moment, when she didn\u2019t hear any reply from her, Chu Lian cast her gaze over in curiosity. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then that Xiyan reported how Laiyue had stolen their food delivery away.</p><br/><p>Xiyan felt aggrieved inside. How could Third Young Master keep making things difficult for Third Young Madam? He wouldn\u2019t even let her have a proper meal! She was faring even worse than in the Ying Estate.</p><br/><p>Chu Lian gaped in astonishment, her black eyes shining and full of disbelief.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing.</p><br/><p>He Sanlang was way too childish! So he wasn\u2019t going to let her eat at all?! Was he trying to starve her?</p><br/><p>Chu Lian rolled her eyes and didn\u2019t think much of it. She didn\u2019t notice the aggrievement and unhappiness in Xiyan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiyan, go to the study and ask Third Young Master about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan agreed and left with a gloomy face.</p><br/><p>Outside the study, Laiyue felt like banging his head against the wall. He was forced to face the red-eyed maidservant as she complained about the unfair treatment of her mistress.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear ancestor1, it isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t want to let you in, but I have my orders.\u201d After saying so, Laiyue pointed in the direction of Chu Lian\u2019s bedroom and lowered his voice. \u201cYoung Master said not to let anyone in, even if it\u2019s Third Young Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiyan bit her lip as tears were about to fall from her eyes. \u201cWhat has Third Young Madam done wrong, that Third Young Master is treating her this way? Our madam is starving right now, and you don\u2019t seem to care at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laiyue felt a headache coming on. \u201cMiss Xiyan, I\u2019m begging you, please don\u2019t make things difficult for me. I\u2019m just a servant like you. How could I disobey my master\u2019s orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>1. My dear ancestor \u2013 He\u2019s trying to put Xiyan at a higher position to show that he\u2019s helpless</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He did not know why but that gaze made his hair stand.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeth, come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody swallowed his saliva and slowly stood up. He then walked a few steps forward.</p><br/><p>The person in front of him was the Empire\u2019s emperor, Abbas XI! In his heart, Rody felt unimpressed.</p><br/><p>Why does he not look very spirited?</p><br/><p>Based on Rody\u2019s perception, the emperor as a descendant of Abbas the Great should be wearing golden armor. The emperor should be stalwart and give off a majestic impression. However, the middle-aged man in front of him looked pale and his thin body was hidden under the white robe. He gave people a deep, eerie impression.</p><br/><p>Hmph! Looks like being an emperor is not necessarily a joyous affair. Look at his appearance, his forehead is full of wrinkles. He must be frowning constantly.</p><br/><p>Rody stood in front of the emperor, about ten steps away. He did not dare to go any nearer.</p><br/><p>Abbas XI finally looked away and lightly sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeth, how long has it been since I last saw you? Hmm\u2026 It should be a good few years? It was when your father passed away. At that time you were still a child,\u201d Abbas XI spoke in a somewhat sad tone.</p><br/><p>Rody kept his mouth shut and lowered his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn just a few years, you have become robust. Much better than your father during those years,\u201d Abbas XI spoke as he walked slowly towards Rody. He extended his hand to pat Rody\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cI know your sense of unease. Today\u2019s incident has already been reported to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody thought for a moment and was finding the right words to say when the emperor stopped him with a gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what you want to say. Bayan already told me about it. However, I know that his stories were filled with exaggerations. Hmph, I am not old and confused yet but this incident actually happened. You actually injured the guy so, you must also understand the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody nodded. Nicole reminded him earlier not to say too much. The more he said the more mistakes he could make.</p><br/><p>Abbas XI looked at Rody\u2019s eyes with some interest. He gave a cold smile and slowly asked, \u201cWhy do you not speak? I heard that your temperament is not like this. You are well known as an extremely audacious person.</p><br/><p>Rody took a deep breath and slowly raised his head. He looked directly at the emperor\u2019s eyes and solemnly said, \u201cYour Majesty, I do not know what to say. For Your Majesty to summon me, there must already be a decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abbas XI looked surprise momentarily before he slightly frowned and pondered. He asked slowly, \u201cDo you know about the war between the Empire and the Great Moon Kingdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody thought to himself. Although the news of the fight had been concealed, it could not have been concealed from those in the upper strata. Otherwise, Nicole would not have found out about it. For His Majesty to ask Rody this question, it would mean that he was aware of Rody\u2019s knowledge about the situation. That would mean that it was useless for him to pretend. As a result, it would be better for him to gracefully acknowledge by nodding his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Abbas XI nodded his head. \u201cYou are pretty smart to know that you cannot lie to me,\u201d his tone was awe-inspiring. Soon, he changed his tone and asked again, \u201cAs the heir of the Tulip Family, what do you think of the Imperial Army in this case?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody thought for a moment and loudly proclaimed, \u201cThe Tulip Family is willing to go to war and risk their lives to defend the dignity of the Empire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words were also taught to him by Nicole. Whatever it was, those words would definitely not offend His Majesty.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, a trace of satisfactory smile appeared on Abbas XI\u2019s pale face. \u201cUnfortunately, you are still young and have not inherited the title. Otherwise, I really hope you can be of service to me. I also hope that the unbeatable history of the Tulip family would continue through you! Great Moon Kingdom, hmph! Merely a group of uncivilized foreign barbarians!\u201d His Majesty exposed his resentment from his last few words.</p><br/><p>Rody sneered in his heart.</p><br/><p>Barbarians? A group of barbarians fought to the extent that your personally appointed commander of the Northwest Legion was so badly defeated?</p><br/><p>Of course, Rody did not say those words out loud. He swallowed his saliva and silently said, \u201cYour Majesty is brilliant!\u201d Rody kept his criticisms to himself.</p><br/><p>Abbas XI also sighed as if he was aware of his own outburst. He lowered his voice and spoke, \u201cThe Empire has just been defeated and the morale is low. I summoned you here so that you can help me with one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody immediately remembered Nicole\u2019s words and hurriedly proclaim his boundless loyalty. He knelt with one knee and earnestly looked at His Majesty in a 45o angle while cursing in his heart.</p><br/><p>This preposterous Empire\u2019s family heir is really stifling!</p><br/><p>Abbas XI stared at Rody seeming satisfied and spoke, \u201cI have decided to bring forward your succession ceremony. Three days from now, I will personally host your succession ceremony. If you can pass the Imperial Examination, I will officially announce your inheritance of the Tulip Family\u2019s title and you will become the new Duke Rudolph. After that, I will have a more important mission for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody did not say anything but he gave the Emperor a dignified look. He knew that at this moment, he must definitely not show a surprised face.</p><br/><p>As expected, Abbas XI nodded when he saw Rody maintaining his calm and loudly proclaimed, \u201cIf you successfully inherit the title, I will appoint you as the Northwest Inspection Special Envoy and I will order you to immediately go to the Northwest Region to aid General Ruben of the Northwest Legion to take charge of military affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Even though Rody tried to maintain his calm, when he heard those words, he was unable to conceal it.</p><br/><p>Go to the front lines? Northwest Inspection Special Envoy? That is the title of the Imperial Envoy.</p><br/><p>Although Rody had never been a government official, he had been to the Imperial Academy and knew the meaning of being a special envoy.</p><br/><p>It meant that at exceptional moments, he would have full control of military affairs in the Northwest Region. During critical moments, he could even overwrite the orders of the original First Commander of the Northwest Legion.</p><br/><p>Abbas XI sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you are still too young and you should not bear this burden. However, this is now a difficult time for the Empire. The Tulip Family is the 'God of War' and flagship of the Empire. Now is the time where the Empire needs the Tulip Family the most.\u201d The emperor\u2019s dignified gaze soften and his voice also lowered, \u201cEven though I want you to go to the Northwest, I do not really expect you to change the situation immediately. After all, you are still young and do not have much experience. What I need are your banners! When the soldiers are defeated, I want your family banner to come up and stabilize the morale of the army. Seth, I do not need you to do too many things! I just need you to go to the front lines! As long as your family banner is up, the morale of the soldiers will be secured. Do you understand my intentions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d Rody breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He was not afraid of fighting on the front lines. As a warrior, he had already plan to join the military and become a solider. Nonetheless, at his tender age, he was inevitably apprehensive to be suddenly entrusted with an important task. However, the emperor was clear in his commands and did not expect him to actually command the army. He just wanted Rody to go out and show himself to the soldiers. The fact was, utilizing the legend of the undefeated Tulip Family was a good tactic to sustain the morale of the army.</p><br/><p>When Abbas XI saw Rody\u2019s nervousness, he smiled and said, \u201cI believe that the Tulip Family would not disappoint me. That is why I hope that you can live up to my expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody took a deep breath, slowly knelt down and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since all was said and done, the emperor nodded indicating that Rody could now leave. Rody slowly stood up and showed his respect before leaving.</p><br/><p>When he reached the entrance, the emperor suddenly spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeth, I heard that you got close with Jojo recently... I hope that you will not be distracted by anything else at this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody turned stiff as he secretly scoffed. He slowly turned and said. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hmph! To fight with the emperor for a woman. I do not have such interests!</p><br/><p>When he left the audience hall, Rody first looked for Gordon to take the light saber back. After that, he got on the carriage without a word.</p><br/><p>When Rody got home, Nicole was surprised that he returned so early. By the time Rody related about his meeting with the Emperor, Nicole's face was full of solemn expression.</p><br/><p>\u201dHis Majesty did not blame you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody sighed. \u201cI also felt strange. His Majesty lightly spoke about it before changing the subject.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole\u2019s facial expression became even more somber. After a while, she gently asked, \u201cAre you confident about the examination in three days' time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody nodded. \u201cThere should be no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026. But now the situation at the Northwest is tense. His Majesty wants to send you to the front lines.\u201d Nicole looked sad.</p><br/><p>Rody felt his heart warm up and he could not help but move forward to hold Nicole\u2019s hands. \u201cNicole, are you worried about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole\u2019s face turned red and she quickly withdrew her hands. She stepped back and looked to the side. Fortunately, there were no other servants at that moment. Those around them had already been sent away as well.</p><br/><p>When Rody saw Nicole pull back, he smiled sadly and said, \u201cNicole, I am sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole knew Rody was unhappy. Knowing that he was about to leave for the front lines in a few days, her heart turned tender. She spoke gently; her eyes red, \u201cRody, I beg of you. Please do not force me. Right now, our identities are different....\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody showed an expression of self-deprecation and sighed. He gave Nicole a glance before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Nicole hurriedly said as she felt anxious. She rushed in front and held Rody\u2019s clothes. Then she said, \u201cRody! Do not misunderstand! I\u2026 I mean\u2026 right now you are acting as my little brother! Wait... Wait until after everything is over, I will arrange for you to be in the army. As long as you work hard\u2026 in future\u2026 in future, I will wait for you.\u201d The last few words were very soft but luckily, Rody had good hearing as a warrior. Otherwise, those words would not be heard.</p><br/><p>Rody felt surprised and stared at Nicole. His face was filled with joy. \u201cReally? Nicole\u2026 are you speaking the truth? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole\u2019s face turned red and she said, \u201cYou\u2026. what do you want me to do? You were rude\u2026 twice already\u2026 Who do you think you are?\u201d She spoke until she looked like she was about to cry.</p><br/><p>Rody felt so happy that he grabbed Nicole\u2019s hands. This time he would not let go no matter what was said. \u201cSo, you\u2026 you do not mind my real identity? I am just a civilian....\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole was displeased. \u201cWho do you think we, the Tulip Family are? Do you think that I, Nicole, am that kind of\u2026that kind of person?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, hundreds of flowers bloomed in Rody\u2019s heart. His past depression from the past few days was immediately swept away. He no longer cared about the emperor\u2019s commands or titles or examinations. He did not even care about being on the front lines. Even if he had to risk his life fighting the foreign barbarians right now, he would not frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cNicole, do not worry! I will work hard! I will become successful and not disgrace the name of your Tulip Family!\u201d Rody shouted in excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Nicole\u2019s face was still red but she quickly stomped in front and covered Rody's mouth. \u201cYou need to shut up! Do you know where you are? Do not shout!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody immediately shut up but excitedly reached out his hands to hold Nicole. Nicole\u2019s face turned red. She quickly avoided his grasp and in a panic, opened the door before running out.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Rody watched Nicole escape. He felt that his bitterness for so many days was now worth it. He was so excited that he felt like roaring.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a real idiot!\u201d Suddenly, a sarcastic sounding voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cAndy, shut up!\u201d Rody was so happy that he did not want to bicker with Andy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! I said, you are an idiot!\u201d Andy\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cThe man being an idiot is bad enough. The woman, who was originally clever, has also become an idiot after falling in love! The preposterous emperor just told you to go and court death. It is such an obvious plot to get you killed by others yet you two fools are still so well behaved. I think that at this moment, the emperor is the one who is really happy. Looks like soon, there will be a fireworks display at the palace!! Idiot!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

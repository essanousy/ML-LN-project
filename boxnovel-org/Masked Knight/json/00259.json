He pulled his hand from her gigantic palm with great difficulty. Retreating two steps, he said with a forced smile, \"Your Highness, why are you free to come here today?\" An evil thought popped up in his mind, \u2018Both being the wives of their country\u2019s leader, why is it that our Empire\u2019s queen is so beautiful and charming, but the Royal Consort here is so scary?\u2019</p><br/><p>Or perhaps, by marrying such a daughter to the King, the Senior Prime Minister had ill intentions towards him\u2014wasn\u2019t it obvious that he wanted the Sauron Royal Family to have no offspring? Was it because with such a Royal Consort the King did not have any son till now, so he made his nephew Aven as the Crown Prince?</p><br/><p>As these thoughts ran through his head, he continued retreating. Rulan\u2019s smile became more sinister as she closed in step by step. \"I was so impressed with Miss Nicole\u2019s elegant demeanor during the night banquet, so I\u2019ve especially come to pay you a visit today. Since both of us are in such a good mood now, I wonder if Miss Nicole is willing to tell me about the views and sceneries of your empire? I\u2019m very interested...\" When she was done, she looked at Seth up and down. Obviously, her \u2018interest\u2019 was not about whatever views or sceneries.</p><br/><p>No matter how smart Seth was, he was totally helpless right now when met with such a sex maniac. She was the honorable Royal Consort, he could not hit her or scold her, nor show her discontent. Even if he fought with her, could he, Seth, win the fight? What annoyed Seth more was, previously it was him who flirted with girls, but today he was the target of others' flirting. Nobody could understand his feeling right now.</p><br/><p>Rulan roared with laughter and held Seth\u2019s hands once again. This time, no matter how hard Seth tried, she refused to let go of his hands. She pulled Seth and walked deeper into the garden, laughing as she walked. \"Although now is not the right season, the Summer Palace still has lots of exotic flowers and plants. I can see that Miss Nicole has a great interest in flowers, so let me bring you around and appreciate them closely.\"</p><br/><p>As she was saying this, she turned around and roared, \"Me and Miss Nicole are going to walk around. You all are not allowed to follow!\" She glared threateningly at the two Royal Knights, and then she glared at Old Mark, which meant, \u2018You too!\u2019</p><br/><p>Old Mark sighed. He looked teasingly at Seth who was already panicking and stood where he was.</p><br/><p>Rulan gave another roar of laughter, and her moves became more daring. She placed her hands on Seth\u2019s waist and pulled him along as she walked down the path deep into the garden.</p><br/><p>In order to properly host Rody, the Special Envoy from the Radiant Empire, the Summer Palace that was used by the King to settle them was quite big, and even the scale of the garden was relatively big. Both of them slowly walked into the flowering shrubs, and after a few turns, the people behind them were gradually lost in sight. Looking that there was no one around, Rulan\u2019s expression and actions became more and more daring. She held Seth tightly close to her and chuckled, \"Miss Nicole, you smell so sweet, I wonder what kind of perfume you are using? Is it a special product of your Empire?\"</p><br/><p>She looked as if she was going to come closer and sniff.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was wrinkling her nose and moving closer, Seth almost fainted when he saw the grisly sight of long black nasal hair in her huge nostrils. He forced himself to remain calm and tilted his head backward, saying through clenched teeth, \"Your Highness must be joking. There are flowers everywhere here, the fragrance must be from the pollens smeared on my body.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh?\" Rulan\u2019s eyes lit up, \"What shall we do? If the pollens are not cleaned off immediately, it will dirty Miss Nicole\u2019s clothes.\" She held out her hand seemingly trying to help Seth brush his clothes but in actual fact, she was seizing the opportunity to molest him.</p><br/><p>Seth could not take it anymore. He suddenly struggled and broke free, saying in a low voice, \"Your Highness, uhm\u2026I heard that you are a great female warrior with excellent skills, I wonder if this rumor is true?\"</p><br/><p>Rulan grinned widely and gave out a laugh, and she stopped intimidating Seth. She suddenly raised her hand and withdrew the huge sword at her waist. She certainly looked a little majestic when she held the sword in her hand. She said haughtily, \"I\u2019ve been trained in swordsmanship since young, and my teacher was once Sauron Kingdom\u2019s most famous old master in swordsmanship.\" The Royal Consort paused and glanced at Seth, smirking as she said, \"Why? Is Miss Nicole interested in swordsmanship, too? Hmm, yes, I almost forgot that you\u2019re born in a family of warriors.\" As she was saying this, she switched to a teasing tone, \"But I\u2019m surprised that your Empire\u2019s family of the Army God could raise such an exquisite beauty like you.\"</p><br/><p>Seth smiled bitterly. \"Your Highness sure loves to joke\u2026I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rulan suddenly smiled mysteriously. Her fingers gently waved a few times, and the huge sword spun vigorously in her hand like an embroidery needle. After several flashes of the cold blade, Seth was greeted by a puff of fragrance...</p><br/><p>A delicate flower which was sliced off by Rulan just now sat quietly on the tip of her sword. Rulan pushed the flower in front of Seth and bowed slightly, acting like an elegant knight and said, \"A blossom as a gift for the beauty.\"</p><br/><p>Seth did not know if he should cry or laugh. In the end, he held out his hand and took the flower on the tip of the blade. A cunning smile suddenly flashed across Rulan\u2019s face. Without warning, she grabbed Seth\u2019s waist and pulled hard...</p><br/><p>The following scene unfolded in the garden:</p><br/><p>A charming beauty fell into the arms of a tall and burly figure. A sword-wielding hero and a beauty holding flowers, both complementing each other. How romantic...</p><br/><p>Seth was so mad that he almost fainted. This trick that Rulan was using, he had used this many times on numerous noble young ladies in his Empire a long time ago. If Seth used his true identity to play that trick of gifting flowers to beauties used by Rulan just now, he could do it more fluently and skillfully. Not only that, his techniques would be even better...</p><br/><p>Ironically, he had flirted with so many girls for his whole life, but today this old trick was used on him by someone else to hold him in her arms...</p><br/><p>Rulan held Seth by the waist and intentionally pinned him underneath. Hence, Seth lay face up in her arms, and right now his face was reddened due to anger, but Rulan assumed that he was just being shy.</p><br/><p>The Royal Consort squeezed an affectionate look on her fleshy face, and eagerness filled her tiny eyes. She deliberately lowered her voice and whispered, \"Miss Nicole...\"</p><br/><p>If Seth held a girl in his arms as a man, his handsome face would be a deadly charm to the girl. Right now, if she heard him whispering to her so affectionately, she would definitely be immensely intoxicated.</p><br/><p>But now, Seth was extremely mad. The Royal Consort\u2019s \u2018sexy\u2019 voice which was deliberately produced by suppressing her voice rang in Seth\u2019s ears, and the way she looked at him seemed familiar\u2014those were the usual tricks he used to play!</p><br/><p>Oh no... did she want to...</p><br/><p>An alarm just sounded off in Seth\u2019s mind, and sure enough, the Royal Consort was pressing down gently...</p><br/><p>Before he could react, Rulan\u2019s lips already pressed down hard on Seth\u2019s...Seth\u2019s eyes were wide open from shock. He could not believe that...this just ridiculously happened!</p><br/><p>He did not expect that Royal Consort Rulan was an expert in flirting with girls\u2014for an outstanding playboy, even if one managed to kiss a girl at this time, victory was still not guaranteed. He would need to make some other moves...</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Rulan was not greedy. She backed off after kissing Seth lightly on the lips, but she still held Seth tightly in her arms. She put on a guilty but affectionate expression on her face, and said lovingly, \"I\u2019m sorry...you\u2019re too beautiful so I couldn\u2019t control myself just now...\"</p><br/><p>From beginning till end, Rulan\u2019s every move completely followed the \u2018classic steps\u2019 of a standard playboy flirting with young girls. The expression on Seth\u2019s face now was not shock anymore, but...disgust!</p><br/><p>Seth had kissed an unknown number of women in his life, but today faced with such a sentimental Royal Consort, this was the first time. The expression on his face kept changing, and a thought flashed through his mind:</p><br/><p>I was kissed by a pig!</p><br/><p>But this was still not the end.</p><br/><p>After Rulan\u2019s affectionate confession, according to the usual flow, a second kiss would follow next. According to the usual steps of a playboy seducing young girls, the first kiss was a sneak attack to stir up uneasiness and restlessness in the girl\u2019s mind. With the help of an affectionate confession, the girl would be swept off her feet and during this time if one seized the opportunity and kissed her for the second time, he could then easily get her heart.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Rulan was prepared to follow these steps. She had already lowered her head, aiming at Seth\u2019s lips for another kiss...</p><br/><p>\"Ahhhhh!\" Seth could not endure this anymore when he saw her face getting closer and closer. He let out a tragic shriek.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing!\" A cold voice rang from the front.</p><br/><p>Rulan immediately let go of Seth. She turned and looked at the direction of the voice, and Seth quickly took a few steps back to escape from her. He then subconsciously wiped his mouth vigorously...Damn it, I need to brush my teeth a hundred times when I go back!</p><br/><p>When Rulan\u2019s eyes fell on the person who interrupted her, the anger in her eyes immediately vanished and was replaced by amazement!</p><br/><p>It was Mouse. She was dressed in black, her long hair fluttered as she stood among the flowering shrubs, and she looked somewhat celestial. There was some sorrow on her extremely beautiful face. Her eyes were a bit red and puffy. Apparently, she had just cried.</p><br/><p>After Mouse came out from Fielding\u2019s room, she came to the depths of the garden alone. When she thought of the death of her teacher, her heart ached so she hid there and cried but she did not expect to meet Rulan and Seth here.</p><br/><p>Right now, there were traces of tears on Mouse\u2019s delicate face, and there was a slight bitterness and grieve in her expression. The black robe she wore made her look very weak and fragile. She was originally very beautiful, and now, she looked so pitiful that those who looked at her would feel heartbroken.</p><br/><p>Rulan\u2019s eyes remained glued on Mouse, and she seemed so obsessed. She suddenly came to her senses and said, \"It\u2019s you!\" She took a deep breath and continued, \"I\u2019ve finally found you!\"</p><br/><p>Mouse glanced at Rulan coldly, and when she saw the horrified expression on Seth\u2019s face, it reminded her of the Royal Consort\u2019s weird behavior during their previous encounter. She immediately understood what was happening and frowned, saying softly, \"Miss Nicole, it\u2019s windy outside, you better go inside.\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, Seth was so relieved, and he hastily ran away. Before he left, he cast a hateful glance at Rulan\u2014it was however unknown how this schemer would find a way to avenge his humiliation today.</p><br/><p>Rulan did not stop Seth from leaving. She was entranced by Mouse, and the amazement and obsession in her gaze could not be concealed. She forced a smile and said, \"Miss, I\u2019ve been searching for you since our last encounter on the streets. I knew you are here together with Earl Rody, so I came here today hoping that I can see you. Thanks to the blessings of the gods, I finally found you.\"</p><br/><p>Mouse\u2019s gaze became even colder, \"Your Highness, the King had granted this residence to His Excellency Earl Rody, and the King had also promised that without the Earl\u2019s permission, no one is allowed to enter!\"</p><br/><p>When Rulan heard the word \u2018King\u2019, there was disdain in her eyes as if she did not care at all. She took a few steps forward and whispered, \"I don\u2019t care about that. As long as I can see you, who cares about the King\u2019s orders!\"</p><br/><p>There was a trace of anger in Mouse\u2019s eyes, and she said flatly, \"If there\u2019s nothing else, please leave.\"</p><br/><p>She turned and was about to leave, but Rulan suddenly went forward and stopped her hurriedly, \"Wait!\"</p><br/><p>Mouse\u2019s gaze was icy cold, \"Why? Is there anything else, Your Highness?\"</p><br/><p>\"Uhmm\u2026well...\" Rulan was entranced by the look of the angry beauty in front of her. She was lost for words, even though she had prepared them in her mind so well beforehand for flirting. She looked at Mouse affectionately and mumbled, \"Beautiful, you\u2019re too beautiful...\"</p><br/><p>Mouse was in a bad mood right now. She snorted coldly and turned to leave. Rulan immediately panicked and held out her arms. Her stature was bigger and taller than Mouse, and now that she opened her arms wide, she immediately blocked the path completely.</p><br/><p>\"Your Highness, what else do you want!\" Mouse tightened her fists under her sleeves. Since young no man had dared to flirt with her, let alone women!</p><br/><p>Rulan looked at the girl standing in front of her whom she missed day and night\u2014ever since she caught a glimpse of her on the streets that day, she was totally stunned by Mouse. When she saw Rody at the night banquet, she immediately tried to ask about Mouse, but because Mouse was the apostate Black Veil Saint, her identity was kept secret so naturally ordinary people did not know about her. The King knew his Royal Consort\u2019s character very well, so he did not dare to tell her the truth. He needed the alliance of Rody at this moment, and he was afraid that his Royal Consort would stir up troubles. Hence, not only did he not tell her, he also warned Rulan sternly against it.</p><br/><p>But Rulan had no fears, so she dismissed the King\u2019s warning. Today, she finally could not wait anymore and came to look for her. When she saw Seth just now, she could not resist the urge to deploy her skills, but when Mouse appeared, her lust towards \u2018Miss Nicole\u2019 immediately disappeared. Right now, there was only this beautiful girl in black in her heart and her mind.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Mouse was about to leave, Rulan panicked and wanted to hug Mouse. However, when she saw the stern look on Mouse\u2019s face, and the air of holiness surrounding her, she felt a sense of guilt which stopped her from really hugging Mouse.</p><br/><p>It was lucky that Rulan did not make any real moves, or else, with the power of this Black Veil Saint, if Rulan dared to molest her, according to her mood right now and her usual character, she would not care if it\u2019s Her Highness the Royal Consort or His Majesty the King, she would have thrown a Thunder God Forbidden Spell at her...</p><br/><p>Mouse snorted and squeezed through from Rulan\u2019s side. Seeing that she was really leaving, Rulan could not help but press her hand on Mouse\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Anger flashed in Mouse\u2019s eyes. She was noble and pure, and she never had any bodily contact with anyone else except Rody. She was burning with rage inside and immediately a red flaming electrical bolt radiated from her body.</p><br/><p>Rulan groaned as she felt a sharp pain from the palm holding on Mouse\u2019s shoulder. She could feel that it was burning, and she immediately withdrew her hand. Her palm was burning with pain, and the hollow of her palm was charred.</p><br/><p>Mouse did not want to continue talking with Rulan, so she glanced at her and said coldly, \"Your Highness, please watch how you conduct yourself! His Excellency the Earl has orders, please do not go in any further. Otherwise, you will violate the Empire\u2019s dignity and cause displeasure among both countries. I\u2019m afraid this is not what the King wishes to see.\"</p><br/><p>After saying this, Mouse refused to look at Rulan anymore. She quickened her pace and vanished among the flowering shrubs.</p><br/><p>Rulan who remained standing on the spot looked obsessively in the direction her figure disappeared. She then lowered her head and looked at her burnt palm. She felt sweetness as well as anger in her heart. She stroked the injured hand gently and muttered, \"I\u2019ve finally touched her, sigh...Why have I not met such a beauty before this?\"</p><br/><p>Her gaze swept across the beautiful garden and was suddenly irritated, \"So many flowers but none could match her beauty. What\u2019s the use of keeping you here!\" She snorted in displeasure and drew her sword. Her gloomy mood soothed a little after she struck at the surrounding flowering shrubs, causing a hideous mess.</p><br/><p>She stroked her injured palm with the other hand and looked deeply at the direction where Mouse vanished. She wanted to chase after her, but she was afraid she might anger the beauty she adored so much. As for the King\u2019s order, she naturally would not pay any attention to it.</p><br/><p>She heaved a long sigh, \"Surprisingly she\u2019s a sorceror...sigh...Although I still do not know your name, I, Rulan, will make this woman mine!\"</p><br/><p>The Royal Consort, with various thoughts in mind, turned around and strode along the path she came just now.</p><br/><p>Among the flowering shrubs not far away, Seth was there as he did not go far just now. He saw everything that had happened. All of a sudden, he held his stomach and laughed uncontrollably. \"There are perverts every year, but this year there are especially many!\"</p><br/><p>After laughing for a while, he mumbled to himself, \"How can I not participate in such an interesting matter?\"</p><br/><p>He pondered for a moment and suddenly a disgusted look appeared on his face. He stomped his feet and said, \"Go back and brush my teeth first!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

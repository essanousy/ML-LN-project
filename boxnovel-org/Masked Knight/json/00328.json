Rody immediately felt the Dragon Spell Scimitar in his hand let out a sorrowful buzz and then it began to crack inch by inch starting from the tip of its blade!</p><br/><p>His limbs too felt as though they were breaking apart, and his body was about to disintegrate. He held his breath and did not dare to reserve any of his fighting energy. He suddenly roared, and his fighting energy instantly transformed into pure black flames!</p><br/><p>That was the hellfire!</p><br/><p>The hellfire had the characteristic of devouring everything, and the golden armored giant's gigantic axe too could not resist it. The enormous light apparition was immediately devoured, leaving behind a gap, and the black flames were working hard to devour the giant's axe!</p><br/><p>\"Lowly apostate! How dare you use the devil's fire forbidden by the gods!\" a loud voice exploded from the sky above. The huge sound wave immediately blasted Rody away, and he fell heavily on the ground.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A deep, large pit ten meters wide was formed in the ground!</p><br/><p>Even though his body was toughened by the Mystic Dragon's blood and became extremely strong, he was still soaked red with blood from head to toe. There were thousands of wounds on his body, and every inch of his skin had split open! Right now, Rody was badly mutilated. Not an intact piece of flesh could be found on his body.</p><br/><p>Mouse cried out in alarm and staggered towards Rody and let out another shrill cry when she saw the ripped flesh on Rody's body. Tears of pain trickled down her face, and she threw herself beside him. She held out her hands, but she dared not touch Rody because his appearance right now was too scary. He looked as if he would break apart anytime. Mouse was afraid that she would injure Rody if she was not careful.</p><br/><p>Rody could not even open his eyes now. He opened his mouth, but his voice was very soft. He only managed to say, \"Mouse, you\u2026 leave immediately...\"</p><br/><p>Mouse wept bitterly. One healing spell after another was performed on Rody, and she was unaware that her sorcery was almost exhausted.</p><br/><p>A loud roar came from the sky once again, and the loud voice exploded in their ears, \"Lowly apostate! Receive the ultimate judgment of the gods!\"</p><br/><p>The gigantic light axe in the golden armored giant's hand had become intact once again and the gap had disappeared. He raised the huge axe with his hands and struck it down for the second time!</p><br/><p>A clear whistling sound came from afar and a huge light ball with a flaming tail charged in their direction. The figure flew past Rody and Mouse like a thunderbolt and snatched the Dracula Spear on the ground like a gale. He then turned around and bellowed towards the sky, \"Stop your nonsense about the gods!\"</p><br/><p>The expression on fatty Sky's face was hideous. He gave out a loud roar before grabbing the spear and throwing it upwards!</p><br/><p>The Domain Master's attack was nothing out of the ordinary, but its spear attack was quiet, and nothing happened. An invisible domain force was formed between the heaven and earth. The sky was distorted in an instant. The opening in the sky where the golden armored giant stood trembled, and it looked as though it was closing up!</p><br/><p>Flames radiated aggressively from Sky's body. The Dracula Spear he threw traveled at a speed indiscernible to the naked eye and shot towards the golden armored giant. It had only raised its huge axe halfway when it suddenly gave out a thunderous roar!</p><br/><p>The Dracula Spear was indeed the vampire tribe's most powerful weapon, which could injure the gods as told in the legends! The golden armored giant's roar was filled with pain and rage. The light from his body dimmed, and even his figure was starting to look blur.</p><br/><p>Sky roared again and soared up into the sky! The flames around his body became even more terrifying, and his body suddenly increased ten times in size. It was as though a light-figure of Fatty magnified ten times exploded from his body!</p><br/><p>Old Skeleton's voice rang, \"Fatty! Are you going to risk your life!\"</p><br/><p>Old Skeleton had only arrived slightly later than Fatty. He held out his hand and created a boundary to protect himself as well as Rody and Mouse. He then shouted, \"Black Veil chick, don't worry about that guy first. He's not going to die. Put up your most powerful boundary! Fatty has gone all out! He\u2026 he has conjured the Domain Master's astral body!\"</p><br/><p>The greatly magnified light-figure of Sky suddenly soared into the clouds, holding a huge, long sword condensed from fighting energy. He roared, and his imposing manner stood up to the golden armored giant!</p><br/><p>A flash of golden light swept past, and Sky's light-sword struck forward. It smashed the little light warriors standing on both sides of the giant in the blink of an eye. Those warriors were formed from coagulation of light, so it was immediately scattered with Sky's one mighty blow!</p><br/><p>The giant roared, and the sky felt like it was going to crack. It moved its axe in a sweeping motion and swung it hard on Sky's light-sword.</p><br/><p>At this moment, it felt as though the sky was going to fall apart!</p><br/><p>Even dozens of miles away, the sky could be seen completely covered in a golden light. Sky's light-figure was knocked off with one blow. It gradually dimmed before it disappeared completely. Sky's physical body flew out like a bullet and finally crashed into the walls of the distant canyon. A huge hollow was blasted out of the mountain wall.</p><br/><p>Old Skeleton saw this clearly and gave out a shrill cry, \"Fatty, you aren't dead, are you!\"</p><br/><p>Rody struggled to stand up. Half of the wounds on his body had healed after Mouse continuously cast dozens of advanced healing spells on him. But he felt pain all over his body, as though it was going to burst open! He could only watch helplessly as Fatty charged towards the sky and was blasted off after striking at the golden armored giant. His heart ached terribly!</p><br/><p>The memory from the imperial palace years ago immediately came back to him. He remembered how Master Autumn, who was also a Domain Master, was crushed after one blow by the God's Vanquishing Spell. When he saw Fatty getting knocked down, his emotions surged, and blood spurted out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>The empty space in his body formed from the 'Divine Primordial Spirit', which devoured half of his strength, suddenly spun at high speed! Rody's body trembled uncontrollably, and a humming sound came from his mouth. It was as though he was in great pain.</p><br/><p>Mouse was shocked, and she immediately grabbed Rody. As she was about to speak, she gave out a cry of surprise instead. She was bounced off violently by a powerful force just as her fingers came into contact with Rody's body.</p><br/><p>The empty space in Rody's body spun rapidly like a roulette as if something was rapidly ballooning inside and trying to break out from within!</p><br/><p>Plentiful and strong forces spun out vigorously from the empty space. Rody was overwhelmed by the massive torrent! He suddenly opened his mouth and a beam of light shot out. The face of Old Skeleton changed drastically. He pulled Mouse and said in a low voice, \"We need to get out of the way!\"</p><br/><p>Rody's clothes were already torn into pieces. Blood suddenly gushed out vigorously from the numerous wounds on his body! But the flow of blood was somewhat strange. It looked like there was some force within his body squeezing out all the blood from his whole body!</p><br/><p>Rody's roar became louder and louder. His backbones cracked and beneath his skin, dots of black scales were slowly showing up! He suddenly knelt on the ground, and swoosh!</p><br/><p>An enormous pair of dragon wings spread out from his back!</p><br/><p>The blood gushing out from his wounds finally stopped. Black flames rose from his body which evaporated the gushing blood in an instant. Rody stood up slowly. He had bled so much, but his body was gradually swelling up!</p><br/><p>His eyes had transformed into an abnormally black color, and they looked towards the sky maliciously. The wounds all over his body were healing at an insanely high rate! Granulation tissues could be seen growing insanely with the naked eyes!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, he clenched one fist and punched it towards the golden armored giant in the sky. A beast-like snarl came from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\"Roar\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Following a loud bang, gusts of wind whipped up, blowing away the golden light filling the sky!</p><br/><p>The scales on his body were rapidly growing. In just a while, the scales had covered all of his body and it finally stopped after spreading towards his cheek. Rody, right now, had a pair of huge wings behind his back, his body was covered with black scales, and he had become three times taller!</p><br/><p>The golden armored giant instinctively flinched at the power of his roar. But he then gave out a weak howl, \"Lowly, evil apostate! You! How dare you use the Mystic Dragon's Spiritual Dragon Change in front of the gods!\"</p><br/><p>Old Skeleton's face changed drastically. He stared at Rody and was unable to utter a single word.</p><br/><p>Mouse was aghast. She, too, looked at Rody anxiously. Her voice shook as she said, \"He\u2026 did he\u2026 did he\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Old Skeleton closed his eyes and he calculated rapidly, \"Hmm, at the southern mountains where he transformed into a dragon and killed Wuya, that was the first transformation. In the imperial city where he wiped off the vampire tribe after Jojo was killed, that was the second transformation. At the Thunder City where he battled with Paladin Fielding, that was the third transformation. At the sea along his journey to Roland Continent where he battled with the first Paladin of the Dragon Tribe, that was the fourth transformation! In the Roland Continent where he put on the ring from old Moses' staff and was hunted down by three Dragon Paladins, breaking through the domain, that was the fifth transformation. In the Hakone Kingdom where he underwent yet another transformation while slaying the Hakone Serpent, that was the sixth transformation\u2026 And then on his way back he got rid of the pursuers from the Roland Temple, that was the seventh transformation\u2026\" he spoke rapidly. After he finished calculating, his expression calmed down a bit. He sighed and said, \"Luckily, luckily, so now this is the eighth transformation! The situation is still not out of hand\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody's body bent forward slightly. He poised and suddenly shot into the air! A loud bang was heard. The ground where he stood previously exploded and rubbles spattered everywhere.</p><br/><p>The wings on Rody's back spread open and fluttered. He stood high up in midair! Black fumes silently spread out from his body, and it was totally different from the 'hellfire' performed by Rody during normal days. These were not flames\u2026 but just black fumes, spreading out silently...</p><br/><p>The golden armored giant seemed to fear Rody very much. Although Rody was very tiny when compared to him, Rody just stopped right beneath his nose, and the giant dared not strike the gigantic axe in his hands down on him...</p><br/><p>A series of laughter rang through the sky. Rody's laughter was extremely ear-piercing, and it was not the kind of laughter that humans could make. When Old Skeleton and Mouse heard his laughter, they trembled, and their faces were ashen. They had to quickly cover their ears with their hands as the laughter sounded like some devilish voice from hell that could rip open one's soul when it fell on their ears!</p><br/><p>The golden armored giant seemed like he was becoming more and more afraid. Finally, he could not endure it anymore and gave out a loud roar. The light-axe in his hands swung out aggressively, and this blow too shook heaven and earth. It was even more powerful than that blow which knocked off Fatty just now!</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>A strange noise came from the sky. Andy and Mouse looked up and saw the axe in the golden armored giant's hands frozen.</p><br/><p>Rody held out one finger and placed it in front of him. The blade of the axe struck heavily on Rody's finger, but no matter how loud the giant roared, he was unable to move it forward another inch!</p><br/><p>Rody remained standing quietly in the air. The black fumes around his body did not explode, nor did it bedazzle. It continued to silently spread out from his body...</p><br/><p>Silence!</p><br/><p>Rody's movements were so quiet that it was terrifying! Without making any noise and too much movement, he easily had intercepted the blow from the golden armored giant's axe which could split the earth and heaven!</p><br/><p>The large body of the golden-armored giant trembled vigorously. It was apparent that he was filled with fear!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he opened his mouth and shouted, \"The devil's power has taken shape! Retreat immediately\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody finally moved again!</p><br/><p>His two fingers gently pinched on the blade of the gigantic light-axe, and then he opened his mouth suddenly! An ear-piercing howl spilled out from his mouth, and Rody's body immediately shot forward like a black ball of flame!</p><br/><p>Following a loud bang, a golden light radiated all over the sky. The black ball of flame not only pierced through the gigantic light-axe, it also pierced into the golden armored giant's body!</p><br/><p>The golden armored giant gave out a roar, but his roar stopped abruptly. He opened his huge mouth wide, but he could not let out a single sound anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>The huge golden figure in the sky suddenly inflated! It inflated rapidly like a balloon. The expression on the golden armored giant's face became more and more scared as he inflated bigger and bigger. Finally, after a boom, a golden light filled the sky and its huge body exploded into shards of light. It then vanished completely!</p><br/><p>Rody's figure appeared from the golden light. An evil smile was spread across his face and he took in a deep breath, inhaling the golden light through his nostrils. He seemed quite pleased, and he turned to look at the tiny golden warriors behind him who had cowered away. He casually waved his hand, and a black flame swept across the sky. Before the golden warriors could make any sound, they turned into a golden gas and disappeared\u2026</p><br/><p>Old Skeleton body trembled uncontrollably. The expression on his face was of shock, fear, as well as excitement. Mouse, who was standing beside him, paled and asked shakily, \"Rody\u2026 Has he recovered to the domain\u2026 domain level\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Old Skeleton took a deep breath and turned to look at Mouse. He said through gritted teeth, \"No\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The expression on his face was very odd and the smile on his face was worse than crying. He said slowly, \"Even the domain level is not so powerful\u2026 He\u2026 he seems to have entered the rank of the gods!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

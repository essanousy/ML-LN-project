They could only rely on their powerful magic to fly as they had lost their carriage. After flying for dozens of miles, they saw from afar a wide river flowing ahead.</p><br/><p>It was already nearing dawn right now. There was a faint white light in the sky, and a glow gradually appeared at the end of the horizon in the east.</p><br/><p>The surrounding was quiet and peaceful, only the gurgling sound of the flowing river could be heard. However, the pope did not dare to let his guard down anymore. Initially, he thought that he would be able to divert the attention of the royal family's pursuers by dividing his forces into two groups, while he and several elders flee through another route. But they were hunted down several times in one night. It was obvious that the royal family knew their escape route very well, especially now that they had reached the river bank, which was the best natural place to intercept them.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath. Under the effect of powerful magic, a golden light flashed in his eyes, and the clarity of his vision immediately increased ten times. He could see clearly each and every detail of the surrounding areas with his eyes. Even the tender shoots on the tree top and the pebbles on the river bank became extremely clear.</p><br/><p>He turned and whispered to the elder beside him, \"Okay, release the signal.\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing his order, the elder took out a tiny crystal rock which was as red as blood from his chest. He slowly threw it into the sky and pointed his wand at it.</p><br/><p>Boom! An invisible ripple, which was colorless and shapeless, spread out. This was a secret signal formed using magic and only those with profound magical powers could see it. Ordinary people could never see it.</p><br/><p>This was the secret signal of contact within the church. By using it, they could also avoid being hunted down by the royal family's armies.</p><br/><p>\"Your Holiness, they're here!\" the elder exclaimed, excited and delighted at the same time.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, in the sky, a stream of gentle magical energy was transmitted from across the great river. Although he could not see anything with his naked eyes, Corsica VI could clearly sense the other party's echo with his powerful magic ability.</p><br/><p>The traces of magic rippled like water waves. It corresponded to the signal he released from afar.</p><br/><p>However, he apparently sensed something amiss.</p><br/><p>\"Why is it so quiet?\" Corsica VI scowled, \"Weren't they told to bring their men to come to our aid?\"</p><br/><p>His eyes narrowed. Although the great river was about a hundred meters wide, when the pope scanned his eyes across the river and probed around using his magical powers, there was not the slightest sign of life energy from humans across the river, but only a hint of\u2026</p><br/><p>A hint of death!</p><br/><p>The pope suddenly gasped, \"Something is not right!\"</p><br/><p>Just as he was saying that, the surface of the great river in front of them rolled and foamed in an unusual manner!</p><br/><p>Corsica VI could clearly sense a strong and pure energy unfolding. That was apparently the most authentic and purest form of energy of the Light Series!</p><br/><p>Regardless of the sorcerors in the Roland Continent or the magicians in the Radiant continent, those who believed in the religion of God all practiced the purest magic of the Light Series. But this energy coming from in front was gentle and warm without a tinge of ferocious murderous aura. It was as if it had blended into heaven and earth\u2026</p><br/><p>The wide great river before them split quietly!</p><br/><p>The tranquil surface of the river was as though cut open by a pair of invisible scissors! The water which was flowing slowly suddenly became static, and a gap approximately five meters wide appeared in the middle of the river. The gap cut off the flowing waters and exposed the pebbles and soil on the bed of the river. There seemed to be an invisible force which stopped the flowing waters of the river on both sides.</p><br/><p>A tall and big figure slowly walked up from the split river. His long, blue hair fluttered in the wind, and his uncreased warrior uniform did not even have a speck of dust on it.</p><br/><p>His feet did not touch the ground and looked as though he was floating. Only Corsica VI could sense that that pure Light Series energy was actually emitted from this person!</p><br/><p>His hand was held up gently, and the pure white ring on his fingertip radiated a soft glow. As he walked forward slowly, the river water on both sides retreated away\u2026.</p><br/><p>This was obviously not a worldly power! Splitting the river easily and causing the river to become static without using any explosives!</p><br/><p>Sweat drenched the forehead of Corsica VI. He who knew the religious books very well immediately thought of the ancient mythological legend written in the books!</p><br/><p>Slowly, the person walked out from the river and came up to the riverside. The pope finally could see his face clearly. His expression became gloomy, and he said with his teeth clenched, \"So it's you\u2026I recognize you. You're the Marquis of the Empire, Regimental Commander of the Northern Army, Lord Rody.\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded. The expression on his face was calm, except for an occasional complicated look that flashed in his gaze. The murderous look in his eyes was not at all harsh, but it pierced deeply into Corsica VI's body like ice.</p><br/><p>\"Pope, did you know? I've waited for this day to come for a very, very long time\u2026\" There was no warmth in Rody's voice. It was as cold as ice.</p><br/><p>He slowly unsheathed his strange scimitar. His movements were very slow and careful as if he was afraid he would make any mistakes.</p><br/><p>\"Lord Rody, did Abbas XI send you here?\" The Pope squinted his eyes, his hands gripping his wand tightly.</p><br/><p>Rody looked up calmly, but his eyes were locked on to the Pope's face. His voice was even calmer, but this calmness sent chills down Corsica VI's spine.</p><br/><p>\"Your Holiness, did you know? I've been wanting to kill you since a long time ago. I've always wanted to\u2026\" Rody said calmly, \"So I've been waiting for this chance like today for such a long long time\u2026I've even thought about this before, if one day I can confront you, how will I strike?\"</p><br/><p>A smile crept up on his face\u2026That was a very scary smile!</p><br/><p>\"Previously, I thought I will be very agitated, very angry, and I will lunge at you recklessly and fight you until death\u2026\" Rody continued slowly, \"But I will not do this\u2026because this opportunity is too precious\u2026I will cherish this opportunity. Even though now my heart is raging, and I wanted so badly to rip you into pieces immediately\u2026I still need to remind myself to remain calm and be careful. I cannot afford to make a single mistake!\"</p><br/><p>He raised his scimitar and smiled, \"You see, I'm ready now. I assure you that I will go to all lengths. No matter what, I must kill you today!\"</p><br/><p>Confronted by such a terrifyingly calm Rody, Corsica VI subconsciously retreated one step back. He could clearly sense the murderous aura from Rody, but the expression on Rody's face was way too calm\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Marquis Rody, I can't recall when the religion of God had offended you!\" Corsica VI said coldly, \"As the empire's marquis who has boundless prospects, you deliberately defy the religion of God in the Tulip Family's fief\u2026You said you wanted to kill me, but I don't remember having any grudge between you and me.\"</p><br/><p>Rody chuckled, and a weird look appeared in his eyes. He shook his head and said, \"Pope, you are very smart. Are you trying to stall for time? Let me tell you, the Flaming Warriors across the river whom you are waiting to come to your aid will not be coming anymore\u2026never. All three thousand two hundred of them were completely dead last night! I can assure you in my name, none of them have survived. Every single one of them is dead!\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible!\" the elder standing at his side roared, \"Impossible! We have millions of armies in the eastern region. You\u2026you can't possibly sneak into the eastern region and kill off all our support army quietly!\"</p><br/><p>Rody smiled, \"It was indeed impossible\u2026but unfortunately, you all are just a bunch of psychics. Perhaps there are powerful magicians among you who have boundless magical power, but when it comes to war, you all are just amateurs\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody gently erected one finger, \"Just one small trick! We just carefully revealed bits and pieces of the news of your escape to the Vampire Tribe, and intentionally advanced your contact time half a day earlier. So yesternight, the three-thousand-men army that was waiting to get in touch with you at the opposite side of the river were ambushed by the Vampire Tribe. One thousand assassins from the Vampire Tribe had easily crushed the three thousand Blazing Warriors that were sent to pick you up.\" His smile was evil, the kind of evil that was formed from genuine hatred from the depths of his heart, \"Of course, we secretly helped them a bit\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I suppose you have been hunted down several times along the way? That was just to hold you up and buy some time so that I have the time to get rid of your supporting armies\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The smile on Rody's face finally disappeared, and a murderous look appeared in his eyes. He said in a low voice, \"Now, I can assure you that there aren't any forces of the church within a hundred miles from here. And you, Your Holiness Corsica VI, there aren't any elders or Flaming Warriors beside you anymore, so, you are destined to die here today!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026As the royal family of the empire, how can you collude with the Vampire Tribe!\" the elder standing beside the Pope shouted angrily. He was so frightened that he could only vent his stress by shouting and scolding.</p><br/><p>\"Shut up,\" Corsica VI suddenly whispered. His originally aged face seemed to have become ten times older in the blink of an eye. His eyes became hollow, he shook his head gently and said in a low voice, \"Lord Rody, you guys are really brilliant\u2026very brilliant\u2026but I really don't understand. Where did your hatred towards me come from?\"</p><br/><p>He smiled, but his smile was very bitter, \"I can sense your killing intention towards me\u2026Such hatred, where did it come from?\"</p><br/><p>Rody walked towards him slowly. As he closed in step by step, golden fighting energy silently flared up from his body, and the scimitar in his hand buzzed due to the fighting energy.</p><br/><p>\"I was just a small boy who was alone and had no one to depend on since young\u2026There was once this person who treated me very well. He was like a teacher, like a father, to me. He taught me how to become a man, and he taught me swordsmanship. He made me understood the truth of strength, and he even taught me all his lifetime knowledge\u2026\" Rody's voice became softer and softer, his body trembled uncontrollably, \"But, you killed him! You killed him right in front of my eyes! You destroyed his soul and mind, and not even his corpse was left behind\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He waved the scimitar, and a golden half-moon slash split out!</p><br/><p>After a howling sound, the half-moon slash struck heavily on the ground in front of Corsica VI's feet. A deep crack was left behind on the ground.</p><br/><p>\"Half-moon slash\u2026You, you are talking about Master Autumn!\" the pope's pupils constricted, and he exclaimed, \"I remember now! You were that lad who battled the Vampire Tribe's prince at Prince Baron's residence that night years ago! It was on that night that we obtained the Dracula's Spear!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the burning golden fighting energy around Rody's body, Corsica VI sighed feebly, \"I didn't expect that you've already attained the level of Sacred Swordsman\u2026Master Autumn's disciple is indeed extraordinary\u2026hehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He thumped his wand hard on the ground and bellowed, \"Come on then! I'm God's most loyal servant. I would like to see how you are going to fight against God's dignity!\"</p><br/><p>An outstanding white light surrounded the Pope Corsica VI. There was a holy glow on his face. His beard and hair fluttered under the morning twilight, making him look like a divine lord!</p><br/><p>\"Evil heretic, receive the punishment of the Gods!\" The elder at the side suddenly roared and took two big steps forward, blocking in front of the pope. The wand in his hand was also inserted into the ground. He drew a cross on his chest using his hands, and then his wand too emitted a white light.</p><br/><p>\"Humph! The Light Series' Gods Guardian Boundary again\u2026Do you really think that that thing that looks like a turtle shell can stop me?\"</p><br/><p>Rody sneered, and then he moved!</p><br/><p>He seemed to have moved in a flash and took one step forward.</p><br/><p>But by taking just one step, he had already stepped forward several meters and suddenly appeared in front of the elder!</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the white Guardian Boundary of the Light Series was unable to stop him. He had just entered as he pleased!</p><br/><p>Both the elder and Corsica VI's faces changed drastically. They looked at Rody in disbelief!</p><br/><p>Impossible!</p><br/><p>Even a Domain Master could not so easily break through and enter this kind of Guardian Boundary!</p><br/><p>Rody's body flashed again, and he went up so close to the elder, his face was almost touching the elder's nose. There was a chilling smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\"I forgot to tell you that I possess the body of the Mystic Dragon! Whichever Light Series Spells you use, unless you've attained the Domain level, if not, when used on me\u2026\" His eyes suddenly narrowed, \"I'm immune!\"</p><br/><p>A black flame shot out from his hand.</p><br/><p>A whooshing sound was heard, and a black dragon rammed through the elder's body.</p><br/><p>The elder screeched and he fell to the ground as a hole was punched through his body. A black spear was impaled on his body, and a black flame was silently devouring his body\u2026as well as his soul!</p><br/><p>\"Dracula's Spear!\" The pope looked as though he had just seen a ghost. His face changed dramatically, \"So it was you who took it away!\"</p><br/><p>Rody grabbed the spear and stepped forward.</p><br/><p>The Vampire Tribe's magical weapon was indeed powerful. The flesh and blood of the elder who was pierced with it were rapidly drying up, as though his whole body was sucked dry by this magical weapon that was cursed by the Gods. He immediately became a mummy!</p><br/><p>Rody pulled up the spear and looked at the pope smilingly, \"Years ago, you ambushed Master Autumn with this spear. Now\u2026I'm going to do the same to you!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

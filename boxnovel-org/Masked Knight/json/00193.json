That was because the Empire had not won a large-scale war in a very long time. Moreover, that was a crusade. It was the first time in two hundred years since the Empire had a victory as big as wiping out eight hundred thousand Roland invader.</p><br/><p>The award ceremony was on an extremely grand scale. The largest in two hundred years. The last time such a grand award ceremony was conducted was during the reign of Abbas the Great.</p><br/><p>The Radiant Hall had never been so busy in the past two hundred years. There was no such scene in previous years, even on National Day.</p><br/><p>The Radiant Hall that could accommodate thousands had already been filled with people. Everybody of prestige in the Imperial Capital had already gathered there.</p><br/><p>Being an award ceremony, it was different from an ordinary banquet. All the men wore their uniforms instead of their ceremonial attire.</p><br/><p>That night obviously belonged to people from the military. Those who wore military uniforms were looked at with respect. Their uniforms and the swords at their waists showed off their proud identities \u2014 I am a soldier.</p><br/><p>All those who participated in the crusade and had been commended by His Majesty were present. There were a few exceptions including Sieg, who had been left behind in the North to deal with post war issues and also the greatest hero, the Duke of the Tulip Family, who was unable to attend due to his health. Everybody else was present and that included Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody walked into the main hall wearing the uniform of an Officer of the Central Cavalry Regiment. He was surrounded by both familiar and unfamiliar faces. It gave him a strange feeling. He had already met most of those people but right now, most of them could no longer recognize him.</p><br/><p>His Majesty the Emperor has not arrived, yet. What is that old skeleton doing? Rody then curiously thought to himself. Could he be peeping from behind the side door?</p><br/><p>The officers of the Central Cavalry came together. Kraft led the group into the hall, with Rody in the middle of the formation. They immediately attracted the attention of most of the people in the hall with the sounds of their leather boots, their resolute expressions as well as the killing intent that could only be acquired in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Most of the young aristocrat ladies could not help but secretly glance at them. Most of them focussed on Rody.</p><br/><p>Among the dozen officers, Rody was the youngest. He had a tall and rugged body. The smart uniform of the Central Cavalry was stretched by his sturdy body. He walked with a majestic gait. His angular face and long blue hair made many of the young ladies\u2019 face blush.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, that was not the first time Rody had experienced such a situation. He was very calm or, at the very least, he looked very calm on the surface.</p><br/><p>As His Majesty the Emperor had not arrived yet, everybody in the hall was conversing softly with one another within their own circle. The moment Rody and the dozen high-ranked officers of the Lightning God's Whip arrived, they were immediately surrounded by the other nobles.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that after that night, most of the soldiers attending would become a military star. There was even a chance that one of them might become a powerful person in the army. They knew that the Lightning God's Whip was under the personal command of the Duke of the Tulip Family. If they could to win over those people, then they would have already made connections with the Duke of the Tulip Family.</p><br/><p>Milo and several his men from the Northern Legion stood on the left side of the main hall. They were also surrounded by a lot of people. At first, the Lionheart Family was facing a crisis. However, after that war, the Lionheart Family evidently had regained the trust of His Majesty the Emperor. Many hoped to take this opportunity to rebuild their relationship with the Lionheart Family...</p><br/><p>Milo took his men to greet the Central Cavalry soldiers when he saw them enter. After fighting together in the war at the North, they had already formed a somewhat close relationship with one another. Those officers under Milo had high respect for the Lightning God's Whip. They had personally witnessed how invincible the Lightning God's Whip was in battle.</p><br/><p>Out of habit, the officers from the Lightning God\u2019s Whip immediately saluted Milo. After all, in the North, Milo\u2019s position was only second to the His Excellency the Duke and His Excellency Sieg.</p><br/><p>When the dozen of Lightning God\u2019s Whip saluted Milo, the surrounding people were surprised and envious. Milo felt proud and his icy-cold expression gradually became warmer.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Kraft talked to Milo, as he was the highest ranked officer among the Lightning God's Whip present.</p><br/><p>\"Commander Kraft, how is His Excellency the Duke? Have you visited His Excellency the Duke?\" Milo asked softly. In fact, he was also very concerned about the Duke's \u2018injury'. However, the relationship between both families was not good and it was not convenient for him to go and see the Duke. Even if he visited the Duke, he would not be able to meet the Duke!</p><br/><p>Kraft\u2019s expression was gloomy as he replied, \"Your Excellency Milo, we did go to the Duke\u2019s mansion but the one who greeted us was Miss Nicole. His Excellency the Duke is currently cultivating and would not meet guests.\"</p><br/><p>Rody stood at the outer periphery of their circle and listened quietly to their conversation. His eyes could not help but look around. There were too many people that could recognize him and he must act carefully.</p><br/><p>From time to time, a noble from the Imperial Capital would arrive. The Imperial Guards would then announce the arrival of a certain baron, viscount, or other noble loudly. However, the following announcement instantly silenced the hall.</p><br/><p>\"The arrival of Miss Nicole from the Duke\u2019s family!\"</p><br/><p>As the announcement was transmitted into the hall, everybody instinctively stopped their conversation to focus on the door. Miss Nicole then walked in slowly. Her beautiful golden hair gently draped over her shoulders. Her soft snow-white shoulder-less evening gown seemed to set her off as a pure lily. She wore a silver waistband which seemed to accentuate her slender waist. Her dignified and beautiful but unsmiling face seemed to give a cold and elegant look.</p><br/><p>When everybody saw Miss Nicole enter the hall, they had the same thought. Since Miss Nicole has arrived as a representative, then the Duke of the Tulip Family would not appear tonight.</p><br/><p>Nicole slowly walked in and her eyes were looking at Milo\u2019s group. She then smiled gently and nodded her head slightly.</p><br/><p>The Northern Legion soldiers and the Lightning God\u2019s Whip officers immediately stood straight. Milo looked in admiration before he also elegantly smiled back.</p><br/><p>Only Rody knew that Nicole's smile was meant for him.</p><br/><p>When they saw Nicole walk in, the Lightning God\u2019s Whip immediately left Milo\u2019s side and went to the side of Miss Nicole. Nicole's cold expression disappeared as she gently spoke a few words with Commander Kraft. Kraft was so excited that he was almost trembling. The fearless man in the mighty army had become so nervous that he did not know what he should do.</p><br/><p>The people in the hall were in various states of minds. While they were still secretly looking at Nicole, the arrival of another person was loudly announced.</p><br/><p>Everybody quickly stopped talking and then stood upright.</p><br/><p>\"His Majesty the Emperor has arrived!\"</p><br/><p>'Abbas XI' slowly walked in, under the escort of several Imperial Guards. Rody immediately saw Sky who was standing beside the Emperor. That fatty secretly winked at him.</p><br/><p>The following procedures were in accordance with the tradition of the Empire. In the spirit of respect for heroes who had contributed to the Empire, His Majesty the Emperor personally read out the names of those heroes. They then stepped forward to be bestowed the awards by His Majesty the Emperor.</p><br/><p>About twenty people, who were to be conferred, knelt in the front of the hall. After His Majesty the Emperor finished calling out their names on the list, he walked up to the kneeling heroes and, one by one, placed a red gem sword on their shoulders. He then casually gave a few encouraging words before helping them wear their medals. Rody was the last person. When the Emperor walked up to him, Rody suddenly felt an ominous feeling.</p><br/><p>Looks like there are some plans that Andy have not told me!</p><br/><p>\"Young man, you did very well!\" The Emperor\u2019s voice was not loud but everybody could clearly hear his words in the quiet hall. Besides that, the Emperor had an affectionate expression and his eyes were filled with pride and love. Rody then heard the bastard affectionately said, \"I am proud of you!\"</p><br/><p>I am proud of you!</p><br/><p>I am proud of you!</p><br/><p>What do these words mean? The tone used is what a proud father uses when talking to his successful son!</p><br/><p>Mmmm! The hall suddenly seemed to hum like a beehive. Everybody in the hall started whispering to one another.</p><br/><p>Who is this young man? Where did he come from?</p><br/><p>They had originally thought that Rody was an officer from the Lightning God's Whip, but at that moment, they were even more interested and curious about his identity.</p><br/><p>Rody was already a little muddled. For a moment, he could not understand what was implied in Andy's last few words. However, at that time, the Emperor had gently pinned the medal on Rody's chest. He then loudly said, \"Let us enjoy the night! For the heroes of the Empire!\"</p><br/><p>As the hall cheered, the Emperor personally pulled Rody up and led him slowly to the back of the hall.</p><br/><p>A group of performers for the Imperial Court entered the hall along with those carrying an abundance of food, exquisite tableware, and fine wine.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, nobody bothered to pay attention to these. They were still making guesses about the identity of that young officer whom His Majesty the Emperor had led away.</p><br/><p>Some of them were so curious that they enquired around them. However, even the Lightning God\u2019s Whip and the Northern Legion were not clear about Rody\u2019s identity. The only thing they knew was that the young man was the captain of the bodyguards of the Duke of the Tulip Family.</p><br/><p>Just a captain of bodyguards? Why does His Majesty the Emperor favor a simple captain so much?</p><br/><p>Even Nicole, from time to time, looked anxiously at that door at the back of the hall. She was unsure of what they were doing. A few wealthy young nobles approached her, from time to time, to strike a conversation with her. Nicole was the star of the night. She was a beautiful woman and the eldest daughter of the number one family in the Empire. She was also the older sister of the Imperial Marshall, the Duke of the Tulip Family and those nobles wanted to be in her good books.</p><br/><p>Although a lot of young talented men approached her, Nicole was obviously not interested in them at all.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, she reluctantly entertained them with a few words. However, after some time, Nicole started to furrow her eyebrows and it was evident that she was feeling impatient. She became fed up and started to look at them annoyingly.</p><br/><p>Kraft and the Lightning God's Whip began to act. They firmly stood around Miss Nicole to obstruct all those that tried to approach her. The nobles looked at the ferocious officers who were also the heroes of the Empire. Naturally, the nobles were afraid to offend them.</p><br/><p>When the Lightning God's Whip noticed that Nicole's eyes, from time to time, were looking at the door that His Majesty the Emperor had entered, they could not help but remember the incident when the Emperor proposed to Miss Nicole. Although the difference in age between His Majesty the Emperor and Miss Nicole was extremely big, it would still be a good thing if Miss Nicole were to marry the Emperor.</p><br/><p>Two Wolf Fang officers that were present knew a little about His Excellency the Duke\u2019s reaction then. It seemed like the Duke was disgusted with His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s marriage proposal.</p><br/><p>Finally, after a while, the back door reopened. Several servants walked out. They were followed by His Majesty the Emperor who seemed to be in a good mood, even smiling a little. Following behind the Emperor was Rody.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Rody had already changed his clothes. His original smart uniform of the Lightning God's Whip had been replaced with the standard attire for nobles. His long blue hair gently scattered behind his back but he looked like he was at a loss.</p><br/><p>When Andy took him to the back, Rody thought that Andy wanted to say something to him. However, the old skeleton had only dragged him to the back to change clothes... Just a change of clothes!</p><br/><p>What is this old skeleton up to?</p><br/><p>The banquet had begun. Everybody looked curiously at the young man behind the Emperor. Who is he? Why is the Emperor so intimate with him?</p><br/><p>In accordance with convention, the next event would be the first dance of the banquet. Based on the courtesy of the nobles, the Emperor would invite the Empress for the first dance. At that moment, the musical performers had prepared themselves and started to play a light and gentle music. When the Emperor casually clapped his hands, the crowd in the hall stopped talking and stood back to create a space in the middle of the hall.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone!\" The Emperor said, \"Tonight is a happy night. Let us sing our praises for the heroes of the Empire!\" Only Rody felt something was wrong when he heard the Emperor's voice. He was too familiar with the old skeleton's tone. Every time the skeleton used that kind of tone, he was up to some kind of mischievous plan.</p><br/><p>\"Due to the Empress's poor health, she is unable to attend tonight's banquet. So, I will give this opportunity of the first dance tonight to one of the heroes of the Empire! Let this hero of the Empire replace me for tonight's first dance!\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor slowly looked at the audience after he finished speaking. All those that he looked at could not help but straighten their chests. This is a great opportunity! To replace His Majesty the Emperor as the first one to dance in the banquet is a supreme honor!</p><br/><p>The old skeleton smiled happily and said, \"So, I suggest... we let the youngest hero of the Empire invite the most beautiful woman in the Imperial Capital for the first dance, tonight!\" He then smiled cunningly and said, \"Rody, Miss Nicole, I suppose you will not reject my proposal\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The audience went into an uproar.</p><br/><p>Marquis Garoline, who was in the crowd, was surprised. He looked at Rody, who was standing beside the Emperor, and then he looked back at the Emperor's expression. He suddenly had a horrifying thought.</p><br/><p>Could\u2026 Could this young man be... His Majesty\u2019s illegitimate child?</p><br/><p>Rody looked at Andy in surprise. Although he did not speak, his eyes had clearly stated what he wanted to say. What are you trying to do?</p><br/><p>Andy smiled faintly. He deliberately gave an affectionate expression and calmly said, \"Young people do not need to be so shy\u2026 Child, I am proud of you tonight!\"</p><br/><p>Those words shocked everybody.</p><br/><p>Marquis Garoline took a deep breath as his brain churned at high speed. Previously, His Majesty the Emperor did not appoint a Crown Prince. Even after the Empress was pregnant, His Majesty did not indicate the slightest intention of appointing a Crown Prince... This man is young enough to be His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s son\u2026 Ah, what was his name? Rody\u2026 I have not heard of this name before but he could actually enter the Lightning God\u2019s Whip at such a young age and is also the Duke\u2019s trusted subordinate\u2026 Hmmp\u2026 A young hero of the Empire and also the words \u2018I am proud of you\u2019.</p><br/><p>Marquis Garoline sighed and thought to himself. I am really stupid. Really stupid...This young man must be His Majesty the Emperor's illegitimate child!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

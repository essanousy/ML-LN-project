I can only laugh \u2014 there are people with such a question. Please read chapter 149...)</p><br/><p>When they saw Diane standing at the door, Rody and Myka quickly broke off their embrace. However, the red-faced Myka still bravely leaned on Rody.</p><br/><p>Diane showed a strange expression as she walked in and laughed. \"What\u2019s wrong? Did I come at a bad time?\" These words were embarrassing for the two but luckily Diane did not pursue the matter. She blushed as she looked at Rody and Myka. When she saw Myka\u2019s red face, the passion in her eyes, and her messy hair, she could easily guess what the two of them had been doing.</p><br/><p>Diane cleared her throat and then said, \"I\u2026 Uh\u2026 I actually did not want to disturb you. However, Darke has already seen Rody. I and Myka knew Rody\u2019s identity but I do not know how to explain this to Darke. So, I came back here. The two of you, please stop scolding me in your hearts.\"</p><br/><p>Rody frowned and thought to himself. He then replied, \"Darke should be told about this matter. In the future, there are many things that I will need his help with. This matter involves many people but I do not have many helpers by my side. I trust Darke but I still need to find a suitable time to tell him.\"</p><br/><p>Diane nodded and then loudly said, \"Alright. I have asked what I wanted to ask! The two of you\u2026 Please carry on! I\u2026 I am going!\"</p><br/><p>Diane had a red face as she turned to leave. At that moment, Myka suddenly stood up. She walked to Diane\u2019s side and pulled her hand. She laughed and said, \"Stop running! Such naughty words \u2026 carry on what ... \"</p><br/><p>Rody looked awkward. He then stood up and said, \"I need to return to the barracks. I cannot stay here too long. The two of you should just stay here in West Hill. This place also looks secluded.\"</p><br/><p>Diane stared at Rody and loudly asked, \"Are you going to let Myka just stay here? You are not taking her back with you?\"</p><br/><p>Rody was silent for a while. He looked at Myka guiltily before saying, \"I can\u2019t right now\u2026 I cannot reveal my identity right now and women are forbidden in the barracks...\"</p><br/><p>Diane then asked, \"If women are forbidden in the barracks, what about the Duke\u2019s other home?\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed as he slowly pulled Myka's hands. He whispered, \"I\u2026 I do not know how to say this to you. Right now, my identity is a little peculiar. According to our plans, we would slowly reveal my relationship with Nicole. So, for the next few days, I cannot accompany you... This involved too many people... The burden would be too heavy\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Myka smiled calmly and gently said, \"I understand. You do not need to say anymore. I will wait for you here.\"</p><br/><p>Myka\u2019s words made Rody feel even more guilty. He then said, \"I have no choice. My current identity involves too many people. If the plan fails, the consequences would be serious. Myka. Can you understand that?\"</p><br/><p>Myka shook her head and softly said, \"It does not matter. I will believe whatever you say.\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked at Myka and softly said, \"I have truly caused you a lot of heartaches.\"</p><br/><p>Diane coughed lightly when he saw the two lovers stare at each other and gave a wry smile. \"The two of you really think I am transparent. Alright... I am going now. Even if you do not scold me, I will still feel out of place.\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head. He then laughed and said, \"I have to go back now. Be careful in West Hill. If you have any problems, look for me at the barracks.\" He then looked and Myka and said, \"Wait here for me. I will come back for you.\"</p><br/><p>Diane watched Rody leave. She then turned to Myka and hatefully said, \"Are you really just letting him go like this? You have followed him for thousands of miles. You finally found him today but then you are just letting him leave like this?\"</p><br/><p>Myka smiled and replied, \"What else could I do? Do you want him to take me back immediately? Do you want him to marry me immediately?\" Myka then shook her head and continued, \"He is also quite busy. How could I disturb him? I already knew about his feelings for Nicole since the time I realized I liked him. His relationship with Nicole \u2026 I already stopped caring since the first day I started following him. If he said that he would come and look for me, he would definitely do it. As for you\u2026\" Myke gave Diane a strange smile. She pulled Diane\u2019s hand and whispered in her ear. \"Do you think I do not know what you are thinking of?\"</p><br/><p>Rody did not return to the barracks. He went straight to the Duke\u2019s mansion. That night, the local officials greeted the Duke's group with a banquet.</p><br/><p>The Duke had announced that he would not be able to attend and Nicole would represent the Duke during the banquet. Rody would also appear publicly.</p><br/><p>Although Rody did not like this kind of activities among the nobles, he had to be patient in order to gradually reveal his relationship with Nicole.</p><br/><p>When he entered Nicole\u2019s room, he saw Nicole lost in thought as she looked at the ceremonial clothes on the bed. When she saw Rody walk in, she came forward. She smiled and said, \"Why are you so late? I am choosing the clothes for you to wear.\"</p><br/><p>Rody gave a wry smile. He was thinking about how to explain to Nicole about Myka. Nicole pulled Rody to the bed and whispered, \"Tonight, we will appear publicly. Ah. You will definitely gain a lot of attention. Basically, do not make any mistakes. Do not let people see your connection with the Duke...\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed bitterly and said, \"This is somewhat strange. Even when I am myself, I am worried about people recognizing me as someone else... aaii...\"</p><br/><p>Nicole laughed and said, \"I know you do not like it but\u2026 You just have to be patient even if it is just for me. After tonight, you can pursue me as Rody. After that, we can be together and then\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded and gently hugged Nicole. \"Let us go step by step... Today, I...\" Rody then made a strange face as he thought to himself. After that, he became determined and said, \"Nicole. I have something to say to you.\"</p><br/><p>Nicole finally noticed that Rody\u2019s expression was different from the usual. She sat down slowly and asked, \"What\u2019s wrong?\"</p><br/><p>Rody took a deep breath. Looking at Nicole\u2019s concerned face, he felt guilty. He then thought about Myka's deep love and he gritted his teeth. He took a deep breath and said, \"Do you remember the time I had just started masquerading as your brother\u2026 the day you sent me back to the Imperial Academy?\"</p><br/><p>Nicole laughed and said, \"Of course! I remember that you were very reluctant and I had to force you to go... Do you remember \u2026 At that time, I was still your master!\"</p><br/><p>Rody also laughed. He remembered that he was a simple warrior who was severely punished by Nicole and felt nostalgic. He pulled Nicole up and had her sit in his arms. He then sighed and continued, \"That day in the academy, I met with Bayan and then\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody then told the story of how he met Bayan, how Bayan brought him to a brothel and how he met Myka.</p><br/><p>Nicole\u2019s face changed slowly as she whispered, \"Was it the day you fought against the guard that belonged to Prince Sultan, the Great Moon Kingdom's envoy?\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded. Although he felt embarrassed, he still told everything about himself with Myka.</p><br/><p>Nicole\u2019s face gradually turned pale and her body trembled. She bit her lips quietly as she listened to Rody\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>When Rody finished, Nicole trembled and asked, \"Then, why are you telling me this?\"</p><br/><p>Rody saw that Nicole was gently trembling and quickly held her. He then whispered, \"Nicole. I know I am originally just a commoner warrior. You were the one who brought me onto this magnificent stage and also my first love. No matter what, my feelings for you would not change. But\u2026 I also cannot abandon Myka. Right now I\u2026\" Rody gave a bitter laugh and said, \"I feel like a scoundrel.\"</p><br/><p>Nicole was silent for a moment. She sighed and slowly whispered, \"You are not a scoundrel.\" She then looked at Rody with a complicated gaze and whispered, \"Can you let me think about this for a while?\"</p><br/><p>Rody became scared and tightly hugged Nicole. \"What are you thinking of? Do you want to leave me? That is impossible!\"</p><br/><p>Nicole looked as if she had tears in her eyes as she shook her head. She laughed with a bit of agony as she said, \"Leave you? How am I supposed to leave you? Do I even have a choice? Can you just let me think for a while? Rody. Right now, I do not know anything and don't ask me anything. Just let me think for a while.\"</p><br/><p>Rody gritted his teeth and said, \"No. I won\u2019t leave. I will stay here and watch you.\"</p><br/><p>Nicole laughed and replied, \"Watch me? Are you afraid that I would run away? Are you afraid that I would disappear?\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded and whispered, \"Yes! The way you look right now\u2026 I am afraid that you would just disappear!\"</p><br/><p>Nicole shook her head and softly said, \"I will not run away\u2026 Just\u2026 Just don\u2019t force me to say anything right now. Just let me think about it for a moment.\" Her face was sad, and she sighed sadly and said, \"In fact, I should have known. Your identity now is different. Naturally, there would be a lot of women by your side.\" Nicole then stretched out her hands to touch Rody\u2019s face. She then covered Rody\u2019s mouth with her hand to stop him from explaining. She then pulled out a silver chain from Rody\u2019s chest. On the chain was a black iron ring.</p><br/><p>Nicole held the ring in her hand. She then smiled and said, \"I always see this hanging on your chest. I believe there should also be an \u2018interesting\u2019 story about it too...\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed. That ring was originally a gift from Muse, the Black Veil Saint. He was at a loss and could not help but hold Nicole\u2019s hand. He then whispered, \"You knew it earlier?\"</p><br/><p>Nicole nodded but then she immediately shook her head and smiled, \"It crossed my mind\u2026 Did you know? Women are usually very sensitive. I have long realized that this was always hanging around your neck. I also know that you are becoming more powerful and becoming more respected. The women at your side would definitely not just be me alone... I grew up in the circle of nobles and have already seen this kind of thing many times.\"</p><br/><p>Rody was disconcerted. He quickly and loudly replied, \"No! This is not what you think\u2026 I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Nicole laughed bitterly and looked at Rody with tender eyes. She softly said, \"I understand. You do not have to say anything. I really understand. I know you. I also know that you are different from that person\u2026 But\u2026\" Her eyes turned red as she continued, \"In the end, I am a woman. I am not able to dismiss it.\"</p><br/><p>Rody then held Nicole\u2019s hand with one hand and hugged her with the other. He then told her about how he got the ring. Once again, Nicole remained silent as she listened to Rody.</p><br/><p>However, this time Nicole showed a worried expression. She did not blame Rody but she still whispered, \"This is problematic. After all, Muse is from the Roland Continent. Do you intend to look for her in the Roland Continent?\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and whispered, \"I do not know\u2026 However, I know that I will go and find her. My relationship with her, with you and with Myka are all different. She did not say anything to me. Neither did I say anything to her. However, I will definitely go to the Roland Continent once. No matter what, I will definitely go and see her once.\"</p><br/><p>Nicole sighed softly and murmured, \"You. I really do not know what to say to you\u2026 Rody. There are times when your heart is hard. However, sometimes it is too soft.\"</p><br/><p>They no longer said anything. Rody continued to hold Nicole in fear that she might fly away. On the other hand, Nicole slowly closed her eyes. Her face was calm as if she was already asleep but sparkling tears flowed from the corner of her eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

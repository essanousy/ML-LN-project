Before Nedis and the old sorcerer could say anything, Sky had already jumped down.</p><br/><p>\"Rody boy, are you still alive?\" Fatty looked closely at the ground, searching while flying forward. At the same time, Sky was surreptitiously vigilant. That boy had gone crazily violent and only God knew whether he was sober yet. In case he hid in the dark and shot out his 'Mystic Dragon Purge', then Sky would have been killed.</p><br/><p>\"Haha...haha...hahaha...\" A weak laughter came from a distant. That laughter was mixed with the sounds of breathing and violent coughs. It sounded like Rody.</p><br/><p>Fatty immediately attentively rushed over. Rody was tottering and on the verge of collapsing. He stood there in his already torn and tattered clothes. His body was covered with numerous wounds as if a blood man was standing there. He pointed at something in front of him and issued a burst of wild laughter.</p><br/><p>Fatty looked towards where Rody's finger was pointing and immediately saw that thing. It was actually the Hakone Serpent.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Hakone Serpent no longer looked like a snake monster. Only two heads remained from the original eight. It looked like a double-headed snake and the body of the snake had shrunk tremendously. </p><br/><p>Its length was about the same as the height of a person. With only two heads left, the Hakone Serpent seemed weak against Rody. It was vomiting and its body coiled into a ball from fear.</p><br/><p>Sky frowned. \"Boy, you have overdone it this time. Lie down, quickly.\"</p><br/><p>Rody coldly looked at Fatty. The murderous aura in his eyes made Sky trembled. After that, Rody's eyes gradually showed disdain. He increased his pace and advanced towards that big Hakone Serpent.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Rody was staggering. He was so weak that he looked as if he was going to collapse anytime. However, the Hakone Serpent seemed to be extremely frightened of Rody, who was in front. Although it was hissing intimidatingly, it dared not attack. Instead, it coiled its body even tighter.</p><br/><p>Rody looked at the Hakone Serpent for a while, with his already blackened pair of eyes. After that, he actually stretched out his pair of hands to beckon from the sky. From the thick smoke in the sky, the Divine Primordial Spirit that exuded a bright and bewitching red light, all of a sudden, dropped down once again.</p><br/><p>As Sky watched, the following actions taken by Rody were even weirder.</p><br/><p>He gradually spat out a series of indistinct characters. After that, he held the Divine Primordial Spirit in one hand, while his other hand was beckoning the big Hakone Serpent back and forth. The body of the big Hakone Serpent suddenly became smaller and smaller and finally almost turned into a miniature shape of a small snake.</p><br/><p>Rody looked satisfied. Those characters that came from his mouth become more and more rapid. Finally, the Hakone Serpent roared as its body was hit by a group of strong light and it was quickly sucked into the Divine Primordial Spirit...</p><br/><p>Sky was shocked as he looked at Rody's actions. He suddenly exclaimed in his heart. 'Looks like this boy is already able to control the Divine Primordial Spirit.'</p><br/><p>In fact, Sky did not know why other people could also control Kara's Divine Primordial Spirit. Rody's body, at that moment, was occupied by the consciousness of the Mystic Dragon, so he could not control Kara's Divine Primordial Spirit. The Divine Primordial Spirit was a key that could trigger the power of God's level. It had already resonated with the consciousness of the Mystic Dragon, that was hidden inside Rody's body. That was what made Rody violently crazy and almost entered the demonic stage.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, even though the Mystic Dragon was hysterical, the power of Mystic Dragon that was inside Rody was still far from the 'Nine Times Dragon Change' level. So, it could not be considered to have achieved God's level. Luckily it was so, otherwise, if it was a 'Nine Times Dragon Change' dragon and with the Divine Primordial Spirit to bring out its basic instinct, then there would be no way in this world that could save Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody was lost when he saw the Hakone Serpent being sucked in by the Divine Primordial Spirit. He seemed hesitant as to how to deal with that Divine Primordial Spirit.</p><br/><p>At that moment, even though the consciousness of the Mystic dragon had occupied the body of Rody, but it had not undergone the 'Nine Times Dragon Change' and therefore did not have its own consciousness and wisdom. It had not reached the \"perfect\" state and everything were carried out by virtue of biological instinct.</p><br/><p>Sucking in the Hakone Serpent just now was the only approach that the Mystic Dragon could think of then. So, prompted by the consciousness of the Mystic Dragon, Rody also applied that approach.</p><br/><p>However, after all, the Divine Primordial Spirit did not belong to the Mystic Dragon. Therefore, at that moment, the Mystic Dragon was without wisdom and relied entirely on instinct. It seemed that it did not know how to deal with that Divine Primordial Spirit, that was in its hands.</p><br/><p>Sky was standing by the side. In any case, he could not figure out what Rody was doing.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the consciousness of the Mystic Dragon was in a lost state. Propelled by a faint instinct, it felt that that thing in its hands was very important. However, at the same time, it hesitated for a while because it knew that the thing was not its own. Rody then opened his mouth and swallowed the Divine Primordial Spirit...</p><br/><p>When that thing entered his mouth, Rody's eyes seemed to flash with a strange light. He then turned around to look at Sky as his mouth issued a slight howl.</p><br/><p>Sky's scalp felt numb and he was somewhat embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Rody's expression became more and more ferocious. He clenched his fists and paced towards Sky.</p><br/><p>In fact, Sky could sense that, at that moment, Rody's aura was extremely dim. His breathing was also very weak. His strength had almost reached his limit. The fight just now was so massive that it had already exhausted almost all of Rody's energy. However, he was still being controlled by the consciousness of the Mystic Dragon. As long as there was a target in front of him, then it would arouse his fighting instinct.</p><br/><p>Sky held up the scimitar in his hand horizontally and shouted, \"Boy, at present, you are already on the verge of collapsing. Don't insist on fighting with me. I don't want to hurt you. You...\"</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly roared loudly. The muscles in his body were trembling. His face revealed a somewhat pained expression. It seemed like with every step he made, he had to resort to all his energy. Obviously, he was at the end of his tether.</p><br/><p>Rody struggled to raise his breath. With the palm of his hand like a sword, he seemed to rush towards Fatty. Fatty quickly raised a defensive posture. The moment Rody rushed forward two steps, his body suddenly stiffened. After that, it trembled violently for a while before crashing down.</p><br/><p>The ring on his finger, which was transformed from the broken staff of Moses' God, once again radiated traces of white light...</p><br/><p>Moses' original purpose of changing Moses' Staff into a ring was to control the pair of Mystic Dragon's fetters inside Rody's body. However, just now, when Rody was violently crazy, the power of Moses' Staff was obviously suppressed by the Mystic Dragon. But, Rody was extremely weak now, and as a result, the Staff once again became effective...</p><br/><p>That gave Sky a scare and he exclaimed, \"Hey, boy, are you alright? I didn't touch you!\"</p><br/><p>Sky ran over in a few steps. First, he stood beside Rody and gave him a trial kick. Rody's eyes were closed with his teeth tightly gritted. He was lying down on the ground and apparently, he had lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>Fatty was rest assured now. He bent down and gave Rody a hard push. He also checked on Rody's wound.</p><br/><p>With that check, Sky was shocked.</p><br/><p>The wounds on Rody's body was too scary. He had broken two of his ribs. There was a big hole in his shoulder. That wound was so deep that the bone was visible and blood was gurgling out. As for other areas, there were no less than a dozen big and small wounds. If it was someone else, with such severe injuries, that person would have died.</p><br/><p>Without any more delay, Sky immediately put his magic to use. He quickly healed the wounds on Rody's body. His magic treatment was naturally very superior; in a short while, he had already healed the wounds on Rody's body. Although it was not difficult to heal those wounds, Rody was still unconscious.</p><br/><p>Sky sighed. Carrying Rody in his hands he returned using the path that he came from.</p><br/><p>Nedis and Sith had been waiting anxiously. When they saw Fatty carrying Rody in his hands, Nedis immediately shouted and ran towards them.</p><br/><p>Fatty laughed loudly. \"Little female bat, I have brought back this boy!\"</p><br/><p>Just as his voice faded, he heard Rody, whom he was still carrying, suddenly give a low moan. Fatty was startled. As a reflex response, he almost threw Rody out.</p><br/><p>After Rody fell heavily on the ground, Fatty held his scimitar in one hand and vigilantly stared at Rody. He then shouted, \"Boy, are you a man or a dragon, say something to me first?\"</p><br/><p>Rody's body shook a couple of times on the ground. He opened his eyes and seemed to be looking blankly at Sky. His eyes had already regained its brown color and his face revealed a somewhat pained expression. He struggled to give a bitter smile. \"Fatty, why did you throw me out?\" Suddenly, there was a groan. \"Damn...I...Why does my body hurt so much?\"</p><br/><p>Sky chuckled as he ran over. He pulled Rody up and laughed loudly, \"Ah ha, boy, you are finally awake. Just now, you gave me a real hard beating.\" After that, he patted Rody on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Rody was extremely weak. He almost fell again when Sky patted him so vigorously. His face scrunched up and smiled, \"Fatty, not so hard please...\"</p><br/><p>Nedis had long been pleasantly surprised and had shouted. She ran over and pushed Rody on the ground. Tears streamed continuously from her beautiful eyes, making Rody feeling lost.</p><br/><p>Sky frowned. He lifted Nedis with one hand and pulled Rody with the other. He shouted, \"Well, little female bat, even if you want to cry, let me finish saying what I have to say first.\"</p><br/><p>Fatty looked directly at Rody and said, \"Boy, my time is running out. I was summoned by you. When the time is up, I will have to return. Listen carefully, now. You probably cannot remember what happened earlier. However, the little female bat will tell you later. My main concern now is that you have swallowed that Divine Primordial Spirit and whether there will be any bad consequences...Ahh, I was too impulsive on this matter.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis interrupted, \"Then, will Rody behave like just now?\"</p><br/><p>Sky shook his head. \"I don't know. I think he won't. I just thought that the Divine Primordial Spirit probably belonged to Kara and none of us can control it. It is like a key. We obviously know that this key has access to a treasure. Unfortunately, the treasure is in Kara's hands. Even if Rody has this key, it will be of no use...However, I cannot understand why the Mystic Dragon suddenly occupied Rody's body...After I return, I will ask the old skeleton.\"</p><br/><p>Rody seemed like he wanted to say something, but Sky shook his head and said, \"Well, later you can ask what happened just now. Do you feel anything unusual now? Do you feel that there is something inside your body?\"</p><br/><p>Rody frowned and shook his head. \"No...I just feel that my whole body aches. I feel that I have no more energy and I cannot even bring out any fighting energy.\"</p><br/><p>Fatty smiled. \"You were seriously injured just now. Although I have treated you, it will still hurt for a while. As for your strength, you probably did not know that you acted violently just now...If you still have energy now, then something must have been very wrong.\"</p><br/><p>After saying that, Fatty suddenly closed his eyes and frowned. \"Well, the old skeleton is urging me. It seems like he cannot hold on much longer. I must go back immediately...\" He opened his eyes to look at Rody. \"Boy, take care of yourself.\" He suddenly whispered, \"When you return, there will be a surprise waiting for you.\"</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking and before Rody could say anything, a white light emerged from Fatty's body. Immediately after that, he disappeared.</p><br/><p>\"He...he just left like this.\" Nedis shouted angrily. \"This guy messed up this whole thing and he just left like this.\"</p><br/><p>Sith gave a wry smile. \"He is summoned here by a magical 'Summon Technique'. In other words, there is a very powerful sorcerer there maintaining this 'Summon Technique'. However, even if this person is very powerful, he will not be able to hold on for too long. When the time is up, he will have to call Fatty back.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis stared and asked, \"Must he really go back? Can he not stay here?\"</p><br/><p>Sith gave Nedis a cynical stare as if he was looking at an idiot on the subject of magic. He whispered, \"Do you think that the 'Summon Technique' is an instant transportation? If it is as good as you say, then we, the sorcerers, can go anywhere we want. Within moments, we can move from one place to another. Do you think this is possible?\"</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly signed and asked, \"Where is that guy?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis and the sorcerer exchanged glances with each other. They immediately knew that Rody was referring to that guy wearing a mask. Both of them did not seem to know how to reply Rody. Should they tell him that he had killed that guy?</p><br/><p>When Rody noticed that the two remained silent, he suddenly frowned. \"Looks like we got ourselves an insurmountable job. We have fought from morning till night, yet we still cannot find that thing that can threaten the Temple...\"</p><br/><p>Sith sighed. \"That legendary thing is probably inside the mountain. That big Hakone Serpent snake, most likely, is guarding...\"</p><br/><p>Rody frowned. \"Could it be that the Divine Primordial Spirit is that thing?\"</p><br/><p>Sith shook his head. \"No, according to legend, that thing is God's Record.\"</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly smiled, stood up and patted on the Sith's shoulder. He seemed to look at Sith. \"You are finally telling me the truth.\" He paused for a while, before he lightly said, \"That guy, wearing the mask had already told me. In addition to Divine Primordial Spirit, there is still another thing.\"</p><br/><p>After saying that, Sith gave a wry smile and looked into the distance. \"But, the sacred mountain is no longer there...Where are we going to find that thing?\"</p><br/><p>At the same time, in a ruin, a few miles away from Rody and the others, a badly mutilated figure struggled to crawl out from among a rubble of stones.</p><br/><p>Half of his body was almost mangled. One of his arms had only half left, revealing blood-dripping muscles and ghastly white bones.</p><br/><p>The mask on his face had already dropped off earlier.</p><br/><p>Kara spat for a while. Although his body was trembling due to the pain, his eyes revealed a trace of deep fierce intention.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the injuries on his body almost claimed his life. Kara crawled out from among the rubble and struggled to stay conscious and not lapse into a coma. He then put in great efforts to raise his magic power and slowly displayed a trace of magical treatment light.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, he only had about ten percent of his strength left. At most, he could only cast a low-level magic which could also barely sustain his life.</p><br/><p>Although he managed to stop his own bleeding, Kara was in so much pain that he lost his voice. He looked fiercely into the distance and gritted his teeth. \"You bastards, I will return tenfolds your hostility today.\"</p><br/><p>He sighed. He was ready to close his eyes to recuperate in order to restore some strength. He had to wait until he had received sufficient treatment for his injuries before he could leave.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Kara's heart was stirred. He faintly felt a very weak energy fluctuating from the ground where he was standing...</p><br/><p>He was unable to deal with his wounds. He immediately bent down to dig up the pile of debris. He only had one arm left and that action made the wound that had barely healed just now, ruptured again... blood flowed incessantly...</p><br/><p>Not knowing after how long, a mournful voice sounded...</p><br/><p>\"Haha...Haha...You stole my Divine Primordial Spirit, but I get 'God's Record' instead...Just wait. I, the great true god Kara, will definitely look for you who dared to have the audacity to offend God, to take revenge.\"</p><br/><p>The wild waves of laughter were followed by a burst of weak coughs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

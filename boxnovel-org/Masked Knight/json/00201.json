The local officials of West Hill, the representatives of the local noble families and also some famous celebrities came to greet the Duke of the Tulip Family and his men.</p><br/><p>At one of the banquet halls in a courtyard, the men and women socialized, dressed in their best clothes. The accompanying musicians played light brisk music. The guests chatted softly with one another. From time to time, the sounds of the wine glasses colliding and some light music mixed together. Rody and Nicole appeared at the same time.</p><br/><p>That night, Nicole wore a red evening dress. The back part of the dress had a split and revealed half of Nicole\u2019s white and smooth back. Her golden hair was tied in a simple knot and scattered on her sleek back. She was like a blooming rose and attracted the attention of countless men at the banquet.</p><br/><p>Rody wore some extremely exquisite, tailor-made, clothes. His slender and robust figure was perfectly highlighted. There were not many gorgeous decorations on the clothes. That made Rody looked even more masculine.</p><br/><p>Nicole gently held Rody\u2019s arm and snuggled into him. The smile on her face was filled with the contentment of a happy woman. From time to time, she exchanged tender looks with Rody. Her affection was clearly visible to all who were present.</p><br/><p>Many of them were guessing the identity of that young man beside the Duke\u2019s sister. Later, they learned that the young man\u2019s name was Rody. He was the commander of the escort team for His Excellency the Duke. He was an officer of the Imperial Guards, Viscount Rody of the Empire.</p><br/><p>Some of those people were skeptical. The young man who was obviously favored by the elder daughter of the Tulip Family was not from an influential family? He was just an officer of the Imperial Guards and just a little Viscount?</p><br/><p>However, many of them thought deeper. The interpersonal relationships of the social circles of the upper-class people were complex. Perhaps this young man had some kind of powerful background...</p><br/><p>There were also one or two who were well informed. They had heard of rumors from the Imperial Capital about that man named Rody. When they saw Rody\u2019s eyes, they felt at ease and respectful.</p><br/><p>Many people were around Nicole and Rody. Although Rody did not like to socialize with those nobles, fortunately, he had undergone rigorous training for this and had also a lot of similar experience during his time as the Duke of the Tulip Family. It was easy for Rody to deal with them. On the other hand, the others felt that this young man behaved like a noble. That certainly confirmed their speculation that the young man must have an extraordinary background.</p><br/><p>They saw Nicole snuggling at the young man's side and also the young man's hand was at her waist, throughout the night. They were in each other's arms from the beginning until the end. That made a lot of the hopeful young men feel very disheartened.</p><br/><p>A lot of them had come to the banquet prepared. Although they obviously knew the Duke of the Tulip Family would not attend, Miss Nicole was their target. As the eldest daughter of the Tulip Family, Miss Nicole was already famous for her beauty. On top of that, she did not have a male partner. That gave a lot of them hope, especially those young nobles from the more influential families. They had even dressed well for the night.</p><br/><p>They did not give anyone any chance. From the start to the end of the dinner banquet, Rody and Nicole were together like couples madly in love with each other.</p><br/><p>Nicole was smiling throughout the night. She was completely different from the rumor that the eldest daughter of the Tulip Family was cold and arrogant. However, they could also see that her tender smile was only directed at Rody. When she spoke with others, her smile was completely artificial.</p><br/><p>That was especially true when dealing with those reckless pesky suitors. Nicole would be extremely cold to them, even intimidating.</p><br/><p>About midway through the banquet, Nicole\u2019s cheeks were already red. She had already drunk a lot of wine that night. As the leading figure for the night and the only representative of the Tulip Family, she was the focus of everyone. She gradually became drunk and softly leaned on Rody\u2019s body. The wine made her face look extremely seductive and beautiful.</p><br/><p>Rody sighed. He was the only one who could feel that Nicole was acting abnormally. She deliberately drank so much wine. In fact, since their chat in the afternoon, Nicole's mood had been strange. Although she looked calm Rody could sense the storm in her heart.</p><br/><p>The thing that surprised Rody, at the banquet, was the presence of Nedis. The banquet was already half way through when she walked in.</p><br/><p>That night, that very seductive woman wore a very conservative long dress. Her beautiful body was tightly wrapped in her dress.</p><br/><p>However, her charming smile and seductive eyes were a big contrast to her conservative dress.</p><br/><p>That woman was a seductress who definitely understood men. The contrast of a seductive woman dressed so conservatively would make men feel excited and start fantasizing.</p><br/><p>What gave Rody a headache was that Nedis had clearly seen him. She could not have missed him as he was standing beside Nicole and had also become the focus of the night. Nedis's eyes had a tinge of hatred as she smiled and slowly walked over with a silver wine cup.</p><br/><p>It was only a dozen paces away but with every step she took she swayed her waist gently, causing the men around them to gaze intently.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately felt a headache. Did she come here to cause trouble?</p><br/><p>The surrounding men who were staring at her were enchanted. Obviously, they all knew Nedis. Some of the higher rank people immediately gathered around her and smiled. They then guided her to Rody's and Nicole's side.</p><br/><p>Rody was surprised when those beside him introduced Nedis. He originally thought that Nedis was only the owner of a pub.</p><br/><p>\"This is Miss Nedis, the President of the Wine Trading Association of West Hill.\"</p><br/><p>One of the officials of West Hill gave the introduction. Nedis then elegantly raised her wine cup and nodded slightly. She then said, \"Miss Nicole, how do you do? I am Nedis. It is my privilege to witness the enchanting manner of the Tulip Family, tonight.\"</p><br/><p>Although Nicole was a little intoxicated, she immediately became vigilant. That was a woman's instinct. When an outstanding woman meets another unfamiliar but also outstanding woman, she would naturally become vigilant.</p><br/><p>Almost instinctively Nicole moved closer to Rody. She then raised her chin and replied, \"Miss Nedis, how do you do?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis smiled. She then faced Rody and stretched out her hand with the palms facing up. Rody hesitated for a moment. He then frowned as he pulled Nedis\u2019 hand and kissed it.</p><br/><p>Soon, a few people pretended to chat. Their deliberately feigned harmonious conversation made Rody feel uncomfortable. The thing he was uneasy with in this situation was that he was actually very familiar with West Hill.</p><br/><p>In fact, after his return from the war in the Northwest, he had put down the armed rebellion of the previous Assistant Governor in West Hill. He had replaced the entire government administration officials in West Hill province. When he was reorganizing West Hill, he had never heard of Nedis.</p><br/><p>However, based on the situation that night, it would seem that Nedis was quite influential amongst the higher rank circles. Even the Assistant Governor was respectful when he talked to her.</p><br/><p>\"Miss Nedis.\" Rody finally said, \"Based on what the Assistant Governor said, you are the President of the Wine Association in West Hill. However, I have never even heard of your name before. Please forgive my ignorance in the Imperial Capital.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis smiled as her eye drifted to a noble man who was about thirty years old. The man's face immediately turned red. He then straightened his back and said proudly, \"Lord Rody, Miss Nedis had just arrived at West Hill about six months ago. Her business is in several provinces of the Empire and not just the West Hill.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis laughed and softly said, \"Thank you for the compliment.\" That man immediately showed an enchanted expression. He could not help but stretch out his hand to hold Nedis\u2019 waist. Nedis smiled and stepped back to avoid the hand.</p><br/><p>Rody furrowed his eyebrows and gave a wry smile, \"Is that so? I was really ignorant. Today, I only heard that a wine bar near the barracks belongs to Miss Nedis. My soldiers had a little unhappy experience there. However, now we are all friends. I hope Miss Nedis does not mind.\" He then took his wine cup, gestured a little and downed it.</p><br/><p>His words were very subtle but nevertheless, he was apologizing to her. That was because what he did to her today was a little overboard.</p><br/><p>Nedis did not seem to care. She gave a shallow smile and charmingly looked at Rody.</p><br/><p>The Assistant Governor noticed that the situation was a little awkward and smiled, \"Miss Nicole had journeyed far. She must be tired. Why don\u2019t we go to the back, sit down and chat! This place is a little bit noisy.\"</p><br/><p>They then walked towards the back of the banquet hall. Behind the banquet hall was a hall dedicated for private use. Of course, only the very high ranked guests would be invited to go there.</p><br/><p>The two hosts, Rody and Nicole entered that private hall. Accompanying them were Nedis and the Assistant Governor. In addition, that thirty years old noble, who introduced Nedis, also followed. The rest, whose statuses were not high enough, did not follow them.</p><br/><p>One of the walls of the side-hall had completely been transformed into a huge window. The curtain was slowly drawn open and the charming night scene outside was visible. West Hill was located at the Northwest of the Imperial Capital. Not only was the city bustling, it also had good sceneries. This was especially true for the Duke\u2019s mansion. At the moment, looking out from that special huge window, the towering mountains and the precipitous ridges in the northwest and the local birch trees in the north could be seen. The night wind was blowing and the leaves on the trees were rustling. That coupled with the twinkling of the vast numbers of stars in the sky made the scene fascinating.</p><br/><p>The Assistant Governor was a smooth and slick man. Without waiting for Rody and Nicole, he had already ordered some people to bring drinks and snacks. After that, he led everybody to sit down.</p><br/><p>That mansion of the Duke was usually not visited by people. If the Duke had not returned to West Hill to recuperate, the mansion would be deserted. Everything needed for welcoming the Duke was arranged by that Assistant Governor. As a result, he was more familiar with that place compared to Rody and Nicole.</p><br/><p>They gradually sat down except Nedis, who had awkward expression. She quietly and fiercely stared at Rody, before she slowly sat down on a chair. Her forehead revealed an unnatural expression, suggesting that she seemed to be in pain.</p><br/><p>Rody could not help but find it funny. He recalled that that morning he had fiercely hit her backside. Now he wondered if he had hit her too hard, especially after noticing her sitting unnaturally. When he thought of it, he could not help but reveal a strange smile. However, he did not avoid Nedis' look. Nedis fiercely glared at him with a red face when she saw him snicker.</p><br/><p>Nicole saw the two of them looking at each other strangely. She could not help but feel a little unhappy. She cleared her throat, looked at Rody before she slowly said, \"Miss Nedis, although West Hill is our family\u2019s fief I seldom come here. I heard that you are the President of the Wine Association. Then, you must have a very good understanding of the wine industry.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis smiled and slowly replied, \"Miss Nicole, thanks for the compliment. Most people, especially men, like wine...\" Her eyes swept across those few men present. She continued, \"That being said, the culture of wine is a profound subject. However, most people just enjoy drinking wine and only a few are interested in its culture.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh!\" Nicole laughed. She raised the wine cup in front of her, took a sip and asked, \"So, what profound culture is in the wine?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis gracefully raised her wine cup. She slowly stood up, walked to the middle and gently turned a circle. She then raised the wine cup in her hand and said, \"Can everyone see the cup of wine in my hand?\"</p><br/><p>Those few men present only took a look at the cup in her hands. Their attentions, intentionally or unintentionally, were more at her snake-like waist. That woman was a natural seductress. Even by just simply spinning in a circle earlier, she had created a strange charm.</p><br/><p>When Rody saw her get out of her seat and walk to the middle, he could not help but guess maliciously. Did she stand up because it was too painful to sit down? Was her attractive gait due to the pain in her backside making her walk unnaturally?</p><br/><p>Nedis calmly asked, \"Miss Nicole, I would like to ask you a question. Do you know what is the most romantic and most serious thing in this world?\"</p><br/><p>Nicole smiled and replied, \"Miss Nedis, are you giving me a test?\" She then muttered to herself and slowly said, \"The most serious thing, I think it should be God\u2019s teachings. Religion has always been the most serious thing. I believe nobody has any objection to that. The most romantic thing\u2026\" Nicole then looked at Rody tenderly. She smiled and continued, \"The most romantic thing should be love.\"</p><br/><p>When she finished, some of the men nodded in approval.</p><br/><p>Nedis also smiled and whispered, \"Miss Nicole's words make sense. But I must ask, what is the thing that can combine the seriousness of religion and romance of love together?\"</p><br/><p>Nicole was smart. When she heard those words, she immediately understood and replied, \"Is it wine?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis' smile vanished. Her eyes had a pious and serious gaze. Her look surprised Rody. It was a gaze indicating one's seriousness in the pursuit of the true essence of something. In the past, when Master Autumn talked about swords and when the Black Veil Saint talked about sorcery, they both had the same look in their eyes. It seemed that Miss Nedis was not a simple seductress. For her, wine is the most awesome pursuit.</p><br/><p>Nedis slowly explained, \"For example, the red wine in this cup. It is brewed from grape juice. It has a scarlet color, sparkling and transparent. Based on what I know, men and women in love use red wine to create the atmosphere. During a candlelit dinner, a cup of red wine not only make people feel more pleasant, it is also a symbol of romantic love.\"</p><br/><p>Nicole smiled and responded, \"True, this is a type of custom.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis nodded and slowly continued, \"However, very few people knew the origin of red grape wine... It has nothing to do with love.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis sighed and continued, \"As early as about eight hundred years ago, mankind had learned how to brew grape wine. However, it was not on the Radiant Continent. Instead, it was on the Roland Continent. Hundreds of years ago, at Rhone Valley in the Gordon Kingdom of the Roland Continent, there was a beautiful vineyard. The beautiful scenery stimulated the creative inspiration of mankind. The people then fermented wine with grapes. But do you know that the wine was not recognized by the world? This was because, at that time, Gordon Kingdom was not a legitimate kingdom! It was not until about five hundred years ago when the Temple of the Roland Continent acknowledged the King of the Gordon Kingdom. The Gordon Kingdom was then recognized and admitted as a religious kingdom by the temple. The grape wine then became an absolute necessity for religious ceremonies and baptisms.\"</p><br/><p>Nicole smiled and asked, \"Are you saying that wine was originally used in religious rituals?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis nodded and smiled, \"This is something not so nice to say\u2026\" Her eyes showed a bit of cunningness as she continued, \"It should be said that the heathens in the North were using wine to do their evil rituals. The Church of the Radiant Empire would not recognize those evil rituals.\" The Assistant Governor and that noble immediately raised their wine cups and with a serious tone, loudly said, \"Long live the God of Radiant Empire!\"</p><br/><p>Rody and Nicole were dumbfounded. They took their wine cups and just went through the motions... After all, for hundreds of years in the Radiant Continent, under the influence of the teachings of God, it is impossible to openly go against the religion.</p><br/><p>Nedis seemed to have a delicate appearance. However, she heroically bottomed up a cup of wine, in one mouthful. She then gently smiled and said, \"This grape wine was later introduced from the Northern Continent to the Empire. It is a sacred and religious wine on the Roland Continent. However, in the Empire, after hundreds of years of evolution, this grape wine has become something used to create a romantic atmosphere for people in love.\"</p><br/><p>They then exchanged jokes for a while. Nedis somehow always diverted the topic to Rody. Nedis did not need to say anything. She only simply needed to inadvertently insinuate and that Assistant Governor, as well as that noble, would start to inquire about all things. Her experienced socializing skills surprised Rody, and her skillful manipulations made Rody very weary.</p><br/><p>Gradually, it was late in the night and the banquet had ended. Everybody went out to say their farewells to the other guests. Nicole was already quite drunk and softly leaned on Rody's arms. Although Nedis' face was red, her eyes were still very clear. When she bid farewell, she actually blew a kiss to Rody! She then took advantage of the moment when everybody was not paying attention to bitterly whisper in Rody's ear, \"Boy, you just wait!\"</p><br/><p>Rody was still stunned but Nedis had jumped away. She then pulled Nicole\u2019s hand to bid a warm farewell and then left under the gazes of a group of men.</p><br/><p>After everybody had left, Nicole, who was originally tipsy, suddenly stood straight up from Rody's arm. Her originally hazy drunken gaze also turned slightly more sober. She was clearly sober from the way she looked at Rody. She then pursed her lips and said to Rody with a jealous tone. \"From now on, you are not allowed to get close to that woman!\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked at Nicole in a daze. He sighed in his heart. Women!</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Rody to turn around, Nicole had already hooked her arms around his neck. She then whispered in his ear, \"Carry me back. Do not forget, you are previously my servant, Rody...\"</p><br/><p>Rody felt his blood surge. With one motion, he carried Nicole up and then smilingly whispered, \"Yes, my lady master.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

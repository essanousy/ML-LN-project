Gordon told me that the argument inside the palace last night was really intense. The one who opposed this decision the most was the Military Minister. He wanted his nephew, Milo, to reinforce the Northwest Legion! Everybody knows that the Northern Legion is the Empire\u2019s most elite army. He wanted to take this opportunity to earn merits for his family. However, the Tulip Family also had its own influence. Naturally, someone would support us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody was silent. Although he did not witness the arguments in the palace last night, he could imagine it. Although he had now inherited the title, he was still a young man without any proper qualifications. The hasty decision of giving him such a high post would inevitably be met with opposition.</p><br/><p>Fate was smiling on Rody. It certainly looked like he had prevailed.</p><br/><p>The Flaming Tulip. Since the birth of the Empire, every heir in the family was an invincible commander. There had never been a defeated Tulip Family general. It was a legend! For hundreds of years, whenever there were wars in the Empire, sending a Tulip Family member to lead the troops in battle would always guarantee victories!</p><br/><p>This would not be an exception. On top of that, His Majesty would also support dispatching him as the emperor had wanted to use the Great Moon Kingdom to get rid of Rody.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Nicole looked at the silent Rody and gently asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Rody looked at Nicole\u2019s charming face and smiled. He slowly walked to a window and opened it. He gazed at the horizon for a while before speaking to Nicole, \u201cYou see, the sky is so red. Many people must have bled a lot last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nicole did not understand what he meant.</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and spoke, \u201cNicole, although I do not belong to the Tulip Family, I am a citizen of the Empire! I am also a warrior! As warriors, we must use our power to protect our loved ones and our homeland.\u201d Rody paused and turned around to look at Nicole. He slowly said, \u201cYou are my loved one and the Empire is my homeland!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole blushed but she did not avoid Rody\u2019s gaze and softly said, \u201cSo, are you prepared to travel to the Northwest to protect our homeland?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody did not answer her but spoke profoundly, \"I have heard of the situation in the Northwest. Wherever the army of the Great Moon Kingdom went, whether they were barracks, towns or villages, it would all turn barren! Every time they fight, they do not take prisoners. The defeated, regardless of age or gender, would all be killed! I cannot be indifferent! Nicole, I cannot imagine! If it were my family... if you\u2026 encounter such terrible fate, I will not be able to continue living! That is why I must not let that happen!\"</p><br/><p>Nicole was lost in thought as she looked at Rody. The Rody she saw in her eyes was no longer the big bumbling boy whom she knew. His masculine manner, his angular facial features, and steely eyes revealed an extremely confident self. In fact, throughout the past few days, she had felt his transformation. Every day, she could feel him grow stronger and more mature.</p><br/><p>\u201cRody\u2026\u201d Nicole spoke in a gentle voice. \u201cGo. Whatever it is you want to do, go and do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and sternly said, \u201cNicole, recently I learned a phrase.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDestroy the enemy!\u201d Rody\u2019s tone was loud but unnaturally firm. \u201cMaximize the destruction of the enemy to maximize the amount of self-preservation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, I want to go to the Northwest!\u201d he said. \u201cI hope to make a difference! I believe I can do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a sarcastic voice entered his mind, \u201c Youngsters these days do not understand how complicated and tough life is... Ah... \u201d</p><br/><p>Rody did not change his expression but he smiled in his heart. \u201cAndy, do not think you can stay out of this. You remember your promise to help me? In order to make sure that you are not lazy, I will take your skeleton with me. If I die in the Northwest, you will not be able to run as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Andy\u2019s voice sounded agitated. \u201cWho taught you this! When did such an honest person like you become so\u2026 so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody laughed coldly and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s you! My dear Andy! You are my teacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>No longer paying attention to the raging skeleton, Rody stepped forward and gently hugged Nicole. He did not dare to hug her too hard as he was afraid that this was a dream and that he would wake up if he were to use too much force.</p><br/><p>That afternoon, Gordon led Rody to the Central Cavalry\u2019s barracks. However, when Rody entered the camp with Gordon, he almost could not believe his eyes!</p><br/><p>Is this the Empire\u2019s elite \u2018Lightning God\u2019s Whip\u2019? Once upon a time, the world\u2019s invincible army?</p><br/><p>The sentries in the barracks were standing at the doorway, looking dispirited. The training ground had no soldiers training! What made Rody\u2019s eyes open wider was that there were clothes hanging on the training grounds! Among them were two pairs of women\u2019s underwear! Why would the Empire\u2019s most elite army have women in it?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\" Rody cursed. Rody felt depressed, furious and many other kinds of emotions. For a moment, he did not want to bring these soldiers to the battlefield and felt troubled. More importantly, he had learned of the great successes of the \u2018Lightning God's Whip' when he studied history at the Academy. The army held a special position in Rody's heart. As a result, he felt discouraged and frustrated when he saw the current poor state of his idols.</p><br/><p>From a distant, a few officers were stumbling as they ran towards him. The man at the front was still putting on his military uniform while running!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Excellency! I am a Central Cavalry commander, Saunder!\" The soldier ran up to Rody and spoke while still panting.</p><br/><p>Rody looked at Saunder and saw his unkempt beard as well as his flushed face. Even though he was a few steps away, he could smell the strong scent of alcohol.</p><br/><p>Rody suppressed his anger, gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI am the Tulip Family\u2019s Duke of the Empire, Seth Rudolph. According to the order made by His Majesty the Emperor, I am the current commanding officer of the Central Cavalry. Please take me to see your</p><br/><p>regimental commander!\u201d</p><br/><p>The commander Saunder looked embarrassed and mumbled, \u201cPlease go into the large tent and wait for a moment. I will immediately notify the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody stayed silent and gave the order which was personally signed by His Majesty the Emperor to the commander. After that, he walked towards the large tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Gordon!\u201d Rody could not help but feel angry. \u201cIs this the Empire\u2019s most elite cavalry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gordon sighed and smiled coldly, \u201cYoung Mas\u2026 I mean, Your Excellency. This is\u2026 you see\u2026 it is also hard for me to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody smiled. \"Commander Gordon, you used to work with my father. You do not need to be polite. When nobody is around, you can just call me Seth.\" This was something Nicole taught him. Nicole knew about Gordon's identity and taught Rody to have a good relationship with him.</p><br/><p>Gordon also smiled and replied, \u201cYes, Young Master Seth. Now that I think about it, I even carried you when you were a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody looked calm and collected but his heart whispered.</p><br/><p>Is that so? I do not know this. After all, I only became this young master two months ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Seth, do you know that the Central Cavalry was considered the Empire\u2019s most elite army by foreigners. However, in my opinion, any border guard randomly chosen would be stronger than them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why has it become like this? Aren\u2019t they the famous \u2018Lightning God\u2019s Whip\u2019? Aargh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Gordon sneered. \u201cBecause it is not 200 years ago anymore! On top of that, the Central Cavalry\u2019s commander is not someone from the Tulip Family!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

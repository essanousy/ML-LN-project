Despair immediately flashed through her mind.</p><br/><p>The vampire roared and, opening up her fingers, she attacked. She used all her strength, her whole body becoming like a fierce wind. Rody just stood there and narrowed his eyes as he looked at the vampire that was charging at him. The Staff of Moses swayed a little. After that, the vampire crashed into something about one meter away from Rody.</p><br/><p>All this happened in a flash in front of Nedis and Darke. The staff in Rody\u2019s hands gleamed with a strange and faint light. They then heard a miserable shrill scream.</p><br/><p>Ruth\u2019s body was thrown together with a burst of blood in midair. When she fell to the ground, half of her body was badly injured. Some blood had also splashed onto the tree trunk beside her.</p><br/><p>Ruth\u2019s body shrank quickly and changed back to its original human appearance. Half of her broken body started to squirm as her injuries quickly healed itself. However, she was in a lot of pain and her cries became even more mournful.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph. A vampire\u2019s body is truly tough.\" Rody slowly said, \"Your body can automatically heal. But now, the faster your injuries heal, the heavier the injuries will become.\"</p><br/><p>Ruth did not have the strength to speak. She kept her mouth tightly closed, but she continued to stare at Rody with eyes filled with fear. She did not even dare to feel angry.</p><br/><p>Rody walked in front of her and pointed the staff at her on the ground. A white light came out from the pointed end of the staff. Ruth seemed afraid of the white light and shivered. Rody slowly moved the staff towards the wings behind Ruth\u2019s back. Ruth screamed when her wings withered rapidly and turned into powder.</p><br/><p>Rody felt satisfied as he looked at the wingless vampire on the ground. Rody then coldly laughed, \"Now you cannot fly anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Ruth\u2019s teeth had chattered from fear when she looked at his icy-cold expression in front of her. When her wings were destroyed, her vision turned dark and she lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At the Duke of the Tulip Family\u2019s courtyard, Nicole and Myka were stunned to see the two Mythical Beasts in the cage in the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\"Did you guys catch this?\" Nicole asked, feeling uneasy, \"What about Rody? Where did he go?\"</p><br/><p>The Mythical Beasts were restless. The Fox-Wolf would bare its fangs and growl softly from time to time. Myka seemed to be afraid of them, so she hid behind Nicole.</p><br/><p>Diane laughed as she replied, \"Don't worry. Rody went to look for Darke. As for these two things, they are quite well behaved!\" Diane then blew the whistle.</p><br/><p>Myka breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the two Mythical Beasts instantly lie back down close to the ground. Nicole was still worried and said, \"Miss Diane, these are Mythical Beasts! I am afraid it would be troublesome if you keep these Mythical Beasts!\"</p><br/><p>Diane raised her eyebrows and asked, \"How would it be troublesome? These two fellows are so obedient. I will just whistle if they misbehave! Is there anything to be afraid of?\"</p><br/><p>Nicole shook her head and seemed she was going to say something. However, she was not very familiar with Diane and so she looked towards Myka, who then nodded and said, \"Diane, the Mythical Beasts are sensitive issues. I am afraid the Church would give us trouble!\"</p><br/><p>Diane pursed her lips and wanted to argue with her. However, she saw that Myka was giving her a meaningful look and suddenly realized that Nicole was not an outsider. She must not speak too harshly and offend her. Otherwise, Rody would not be happy.</p><br/><p>With this thought in mind, Diane immediately simmered down and earnestly said, \"This is something Rody brought back. I believe he might have his own ideas.\"</p><br/><p>Diane and Myka winked at each other. Nicole saw everything. She saw Diane suddenly blush and seemingly afraid to look at her. A strange feeling rose in Nicole\u2019s heart. She sighed and said, \"Forget about it. Let us talk more about this when he returns.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was truly an eye-opener for the common people in West Hill that day.</p><br/><p>Countless people had gathered in the streets in the afternoon. They had all heard the news that the Duke\u2019s bodyguards had captured several vampires.</p><br/><p>The public security quickly took to the streets to disperse the crowd. Rody took a group of soldiers with him as he led a carriage with great fanfare down the streets of the West Hill City. Ruth was tied to a stake on top of that carriage.</p><br/><p>The crowd made a big fuss when they saw Ruth tied to the stake. They really could not believe that such a charming beauty could actually be one of the frightening rumored vampires. Especially, looking at Ruth\u2019s naked chest and pale face made it even more difficult for the people to believe it. Could such a delicate woman really be a vampire?</p><br/><p>Rody calmly rode his horse. He ignored the pointing gestures of the people. After all, the security soldiers were there to keep things under control.</p><br/><p>He had his own reasons for dragging Ruth through the streets with such fanfare. After he captured Ruth, he immediately rushed to the vampire\u2019s lair at the outside of the West Hill City. He wanted to get rid of the legendary Prince Jackal. Unfortunately, when he arrived, the old building was empty and there was nothing there. Only those egg-like things were hanging on the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Rody clearly understood what those eggs were and simply burned the entire lair. The security soldiers rushed hurriedly there when they saw the large fire. Rody explained that he was from the Imperial Guards. They then escorted them and Ruth back to the West Hill city.</p><br/><p>Rody already had an idea about his next move.</p><br/><p>Rody had arrived at the religious center at West Hill. He smiled because the Bishop in West Hill City had already brought out a few Flame Warriors to greet him.</p><br/><p>These rascals in white robes were smiling of course. They were informed that the Imperial Guards had captured a vampire. The vampire would be handed over to them according to the practice of the Empire.</p><br/><p>Rody left the moment he released Ruth to the religious hypocrites. He did not care whether they intended to burn her to death or send her back to the Imperial Capital to claim merits. Either way, Rody had already secretly done something to make sure Ruth would not be able to say anything. Right now, she was barely alive and Rody did not need to worry that she might reveal anything unnecessarily.</p><br/><p>\"Let the vampires and the Church handle their own mess!\" Rody secretly sneered, \"I would be happy no matter who dies.\"</p><br/><p>The news of the captured vampire quietened down after a few days. During those days, Rody was not totally at peace too.</p><br/><p>After escaping from the lake, there seemed to be some subtle feelings between him and Diane. While at death\u2019s door in the lake and in the sudden commotion they had shown each other their true feelings but now, they had returned to reality...</p><br/><p>For the past few days, Nicole had a dejected expression. She looked at Rody with a hint of bitterness in her eyes. Rody did not know how he should handle this matter. He felt guilty yet he could not stay aloof with Diane.</p><br/><p>Rody could only try to avoid meeting them in a group. He had reduced his visits to the Duke\u2019s mansion to meet with Nicole. He spent most of his time in the military barracks.</p><br/><p>After leaving that day, Darke and Nedis no longer appeared. Rody went to Nedis\u2019 pub to look for them, but Darke was recuperating and nobody had seen Nedis.</p><br/><p>Diane seemed to visit the Duke\u2019s mansion every day. Rody did not go because he was afraid to see the three women together. Rody remembered the misery of being glared at by both Diane and Nicole when he returned that day. The young Rody was ferocious and would not even frown in battle. However, he felt helpless facing the tender and hidden bitterness of women.</p><br/><p>In this world, a woman was more troublesome than swords, magic, and vampires!</p><br/><p>A few days later, some people from the Imperial Capital arrived.</p><br/><p>The Imperial Guard Gordon had personally come to deliver the Emperor\u2019s orders. The Emperor, Abbas XI, had given the order for the Viscount, a court warrior and an officer of the Imperial Guards, Rody, to be promoted to Commander of the Imperial Guards for the capture of the vampire. Rody was also ordered to immediately return to the Imperial Capital for an important task.</p><br/><p>The responsibility of guarding the Duke of the Tulip Family would be given to General Gordon and his three thousand Imperial Guards.</p><br/><p>As Gordon announced the Emperor\u2019s orders, he looked at Rody with a complicated expression. Gordon was suspicious about the young man. Rody seemed to have appeared out of nowhere and rose rapidly after the war. In fact, it was a meteoric rise in his career.</p><br/><p>Rody had suddenly received the Emperor\u2019s award. He was promoted from the Captain of the Duke\u2019s bodyguards to a Viscount and a court warrior. Now, he was once again promoted\u2014a Commander of the Imperial Guards!</p><br/><p>To become a Commander of the Imperial Guards was to be the commander of ten thousand Imperial Guards. There were only fifty thousand Imperial Guards, which meant that there were only five Commanders. Apart from Rody, all the other four Commanders came from well-known noble families that had connections with the Royal Family.</p><br/><p>'Is\u2026is the rumor true? Is Rody really His Majesty\u2019s\u2026'</p><br/><p>At this moment, Gordon stopped guessing. Gordon knew from his many years in the circle of power struggles in the Imperial Capital that this was not something he should be making conjectures or get involved with. This was a secret involving power and the more you know, the more dangerous it would be.</p><br/><p>Nicole and the others felt unhappy when they found out that Rody needed to return to the Imperial Capital. Although Rody was also unhappy, he believed that leaving would be the best option in the current situation.</p><br/><p>At the very least, it would be better than staying in West Hill and getting stuck with three women looking at him uneasily every day.</p><br/><p>After publicly handing over the troops to Gordon, Rody was set to leave for the Imperial Capital. Nicole finally could not bear it and clung to Rody in front of everyone as her tears flowed.</p><br/><p>Gordon was dumbstruck as he just came from the Imperial Capital. In West Hill City, Rody and Nicole\u2019s relationship could be described as well known. However, Gordon was not aware at all.</p><br/><p>The Lightning God\u2019s Whip and the Imperial Guards looked at the lovers' tearful farewell and smiled kindly. Rody sighed. He had been avoiding Nicole for the past few days and realized that he had acted too excessively. He could not help hugging her tightly and kissing her forehead. He wanted to say something, but he could not find the right words. After thinking for a long time, he said, \"Wait for me.\"</p><br/><p>Leading a group of cavalrymen, Rody journeyed to the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>After leaving the Duke\u2019s courtyard, Rody turned back to look at the tallest building. As Rody and Nicole just only made their relationship public, Myka could not appear. However, Rody believed that Myka would be watching him from the upper floor of that tall building.</p><br/><p>After waving his hand, Rody gritted his teeth and raised his horse whip. He then rode far into the distance.</p><br/><p>The light cavalry riding in haste would naturally be much faster than when he first came to West Hill. Andy had ordered him to return to the Imperial Capital for some reason. However, since Andy had ordered him to 'come back these few days\u2019, there must be an urgent matter.</p><br/><p>Rody was already accustomed to forced marches during his time in the Lightning God\u2019s Whip and his soldiers were also well trained, reaching the Imperial Capital in just five days.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately headed for the Imperial Palace with misgivings in his heart. The strange thing was Andy did not meet him in private. Instead, Rody saw the Military Minister, Garoline, standing at the Emperor\u2019s meeting hall.</p><br/><p>Garoline immediately smiled to him and nodded his head when he saw Rody walk in. Garoline had decided to place all his bets on Rody. Besides, Baron Gadal\u2019s report made Garoline even more convinced that Rody was someone with outstanding future prospects.</p><br/><p>Although Rody did not expect to see Garoline, he was not surprised and greeted Garoline with the basic noble's courtesy.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of the time that the Emperor had not arrived, Garoline smiled and asked softly, \"Rody, is the scenery at West Hill good?\"</p><br/><p>Rody immediately replied, \"Everything is good. Thank you for being concerned1.\" Rody thought for a moment and then added, \"Also, thank you for caring2.\"</p><br/><p>No matter what, he had presented a fine sword to him. As a result, he should say another word of thanks.</p><br/><p>The old Marquis gave an amiable laugh and replied, \"Rody, I have already heard about the relationship between you and Miss Nicole. If there is anything I can help with, please speak. Hm\u2026\" Garoline muttered to himself for a moment and then laughed, \"This time, the Emperor has an important task for you. After you complete that task, I can help you propose a marriage alliance between you and the Duke of the Tulip Family.\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed in his heart. These words were just to win him over. \u2018The so-called \"important task\" must be hinting that he was the one who proposed me for the job that would entail a large \"contribution\" to the empire and hence I better remember that. Proposing the marriage alliance is also an investment. After all, my current position is not high. The title of a Viscount is not sufficient to marry the Duke\u2019s sister. However, it would be a different story if this was proposed by the Empire\u2019s Military Minister.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rody smiled and was thinking of a reply when Andy arrived together with an obese Imperial Guard officer.</p><br/><p>Andy's masquerade as the Emperor had improved tremendously: his face was dignified and cold, and also had a majestic air. Rody then noticed Sky winking at him playfully.</p><br/><p>'What tricks are you two old fellows up to now?' Rody could not help but feel his scalp turn numb.</p><br/><p>Andy gently coughed and then said, \"Viscount Rody, I heard that you have captured a vampire at West Hill! Very good!\" The old skeleton acted haughtily like an Emperor. He then looked at Garoline and said, \"Marquis Garoline, have you arranged Viscount Rody's appropriate reward?\"</p><br/><p>Garoline froze for a moment. 'Wasn\u2019t he just conferred a position? Getting promoted to a Commander from an officer was already a leap over several grades.'</p><br/><p>Although Garoline did not know the Emperor\u2019s intentions, since the Emperor had already opened his mouth, Garoline had no choice but to carefully figure out the Emperor\u2019s intentions. After pondering for a moment, the old fox inquired, \"Viscount Rody now assumes the position of a Commander in the military as his commendation. No other awards were given yet. Your Majesty...\"</p><br/><p>Andy pretended to sigh. He looked at Garoline and said, \"We have already decided to let Rody deal with that business, but his status is not too appropriate. After all, he would be a representative of the Empire. A position like yours would be appropriate. \"</p><br/><p>Garoline\u2019s eyes immediately turned bright and said, \"That\u2019s right! Your Majesty. As Viscount Rody had contributed greatly by defending the Duke at West Hill and also captured a vampire, I suggest that Your Majesty give an additional reward to Viscount Rody.\"</p><br/><p>Andy blinked. He then laughed and asked, \"Oh? Marquis Garoline. What do you propose?\"</p><br/><p>Garoline could not help but curse in his heart. 'You want to promote your illegitimate child, but you want me open up the way for you.'</p><br/><p>Naturally, Garoline did not dare to reveal any of his thoughts on his face. After pondering for a moment, he said, \"Viscount Rody's position in the military is already a Commander. This is already a very high post for his age. Your Majesty. I think we should give Viscount Rody a different kind of reward, like a noble title...\"</p><br/><p>Andy could not help but sigh in his heart. 'This old fox is really crafty. He is so clever that he only needed a hint. He has already reached near perfection in understanding people\u2019s intentions. He is such a clever person. I initially wanted to find a way to get rid of him eventually but now, I am reluctant.'</p><br/><p>Pretending to think for a moment, Andy slowly opened his mouth and asked, \"Let us do it this way. Let us promote Rody to Palace Chief Warrior. His title will be one grade higher.\"</p><br/><p>Rody was dumbfounded. 'Why am I suddenly promoted? One rank above the Viscount. That is the rank of an Earl.'</p><br/><p>'Earl?'</p><br/><p>Although he was puzzled, he knew that Andy must have his reasons.</p><br/><p>After that, Andy finally said, \"Rody, there is a reason I promoted your noble rank. Now, I have an important task. I need you to represent the Empire. Your previous rank of Viscount was not high enough, thus I made an exception to promote you to an Earl.\"</p><br/><p>Rody was silent as waited for the old skeleton to continue.</p><br/><p>Although Rody knew that Andy would definitely have something special for him to do, the skeleton\u2019s next words almost made him jump.</p><br/><p>Andy squinted as he smiled at Rody. He then slowly said, \"Earl Rody, I want you to journey to the Roland Continent.\"</p><br/><p>Translator's Notes:</p><br/><p>1  Guan xin. To be concerned.</p><br/><p>2  Guan ai.

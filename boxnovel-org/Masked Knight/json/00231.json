Can you tell me? What was the attack you used to kill Amu?\"</p><br/><p>Rody lowered his head and looked at Ni Lin from the corner of his eyes. \"You noticed it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" Ni Lin was frightened, but he still gritted his teeth and replied, \"I can feel it very clearly! That was a genuine Dragon God\u2019s aura! It is the most primitive and pure dragon\u2019s aura!\"</p><br/><p>He had clenched his fists but they still trembled. \"I cannot understand. You are obviously a human. Why do you have such a powerful dragon\u2019s aura?\"</p><br/><p>Ni Lin\u2019s trembling gradually became fiercer. The blazing golden flames of his fighting energy that enveloped his body gradually disappeared.</p><br/><p>Ice immediately felt that something was different. He could not help but turn to the side and look at Ni Lin in surprise. They were near each other and they were both Dragons. He could feel his boss\u2019 body going through some changes.</p><br/><p>A dragon has inverted scales. They become enraged when those scales are touched.</p><br/><p>A fearsome pressure of the dragon\u2019s aura began to emerge from Ni Lin\u2019s body. The fierce dragon\u2019s aura even made Ice, who was also a Dragon, feel an indescribable fear in his heart. He began to step back and he spoke with a trembling voice, \"Ni Lin, you!\"</p><br/><p>The long dragon wings on Ni Lin\u2019s back had disappeared. The eyes and long and thin pupils of his eyes turned black. His eyes no longer showed any emotion. \"You may be very powerful! Perhaps you may be even more powerful than me. But as the strongest of the Dragon race, I still want to fight you to the death!\"</p><br/><p>Nilin opened his big hands and suddenly shouted, \"Sa. Mo. Li. Ya!\"</p><br/><p>Countless rays of fierce aura shot out from his body. The dust and the leaves on the ground slowly floated into the air. The space within one hundred meters around him was shrouded by his aura.</p><br/><p>\"A dragon boundary.\" As a sorcerer, she could immediately tell that this was a dragon\u2019s most advanced and peculiar magical boundary.</p><br/><p>According to the ancient legends, a powerful dragon can use their own aura to create something that was similar to a human sorcerer\u2019s boundary.</p><br/><p>However, the dragon boundary was much more powerful. This was because the boundaries were created according to their own skill types and would be most suitable for them in battle!</p><br/><p>Rody quietly watched Ni Lin slowly create his boundary. He simply stood there and did not stop Ni Lin.</p><br/><p>Rody even gently rubbed his forehead. He smiled and said, \"Hm. A dragon boundary. Looks like you are much more powerful than that big fellow earlier. But I wonder what kind of battlefield would suit you the most?\"</p><br/><p>It was fire!</p><br/><p>Ni Lin did not need to give a reply as the air within his boundary instantly became hot. The floating leaves began to burn spontaneously and gradually turned into floating specks of fire.</p><br/><p>Rody felt his skin burn. He even clearly felt his clothes gradually heat up. After that, there were faint warnings of spontaneous combustion.</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint was the quickest to respond to the situation. She had already created a small boundary to protect herself and Augustine.</p><br/><p>That Snow Dragon, Ice, also felt uncomfortable in the hot environment as his sweat poured down his face. He had long since retreated several steps away and covered himself inside walls of ice.</p><br/><p>The Grand Sorcerer Yin Xing hesitated for a moment but he did not leave immediately. After heaving a sigh, he also created a sorceror boundary.</p><br/><p>\"Oh. It seems that the Dragon race is quite powerful. At the very least, one would not need to fear the cold of winter with such a furnace.\" Seth laughed. He had put down the long cylindrical gadget and stretched out his hands to feel the heat as he smiled pleasantly.</p><br/><p>Old Mark crossed his arms and coldly said, \"A furnace? Only you can think of this. Try and stand closer. Then you will know how formidable that is! Just so you know, warming yourself by the furnace is totally different from burning like a charcoal in it!\"</p><br/><p>The air within the dragon boundary seemed to have started burning. Wave after wave of heat swept towards Rody and the ground beneath his feet started to emit black smoke. Even the flames could faintly be seen in the air.</p><br/><p>However, the rising flames could not approach Rody\u2019s body. Whenever the flames got close to him, it would separate into two and go in different directions.</p><br/><p>Ni Lin said in a low voice, \"Just now when you fought against Amu, you did not strike back on purpose and merely tested him.\"</p><br/><p>For a moment, Rody looked surprised and said, \"You could also guess that?\"</p><br/><p>Ni Lin hmphed and said, \"I am not an idiot!\" He grinned cynically and said, \"I can feel it. Although you can use a powerful dragon\u2019s aura that is even more powerful than what I can imagine, it seems as though you do not dare to use it! You did not strike back against Amu earlier and unwaveringly withstood his attacks. This was to test how much dragon aura your body could handle. Am I right?\"</p><br/><p>His eyes then flashed vigilantly as he continued, \"That was why, after you finished testing it out, you killed Amu as quickly as possible so that you could reduce the amount of dragon aura you used!\"</p><br/><p>Rody raised his eyebrow and replied, \"Looks like this reptile is not too stupid.\"</p><br/><p>Ni Lin shouted, \"Shut up! Don\u2019t even think of using these words to infuriate me! It will not do you any good!\" He then pointed to himself with his thumb. \"My name is Ni Lin! I was born more easily angered compared to the other dragons! Another difference is that my combat effectiveness would increase the angrier I become! At the same time, my mind would also remain sober when I am angry!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh?\" Rody laughed. \"That is unexpected,\" Rody said as he knocked his forehead. \"I did not expect Dragons to also have multiple personality disorders\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up!\" Ni Lin\u2019s expression changed drastically. Crimson sheets of flames rose suddenly and violently from his body. He was like a demon standing inside the blazing flames of hell!</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly stretched out his hand gently and looked at the drifting sparks gently falling onto his palm. Rody had a calm expression. He was calm and slowly spoke in a low tone, \"Dragon boundary\u2026It sounds good. It creates an environment that is best for the user and is an extremely useful sorcery! But it is a pity\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What is pitiful?\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed, \"It is a pity that the Dragon race is wrong.\" Gradually, Rody's expression changed. His eyes were gradually filled with the utmost reverence. \"There was once a teacher that I respected. He told me that everything in this world has a rule! The rotation of day and night, the movement of the stars, the changes of the four seasons. All of these are governed by rules! What we need to do is to comprehend these rules and master them!\"</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s face seemed to have a kind of unusual radiance. The small sparks on his palm did not immediately disappear. Instead, it seemed to become alive and gently float up!</p><br/><p>\"That person told me that God was so powerful because they created the rules and all of the rules were under their control. As they could manipulate space, they can even make it snow in June. They can let thunder strike during winter. They can even stop time and distort space. This is why God is so powerful and can place themselves above all of creation.\"</p><br/><p>The sparks in Rody\u2019s hands suddenly started to surge and burn fiercely. Suddenly, it grew and then shrank, moved right and then left, and then transformed into different shapes in Rody\u2019s palms!</p><br/><p>Rody had a mocking sneer while looking at Ni Lin.</p><br/><p>Ni Lin could no longer exercise patience. He suddenly roared. With both feet on the ground, he created a flaming whirlwind and shot at Rody!</p><br/><p>The spiral-shaped flame ruthlessly flew forward. Rody did not even seem to spare it a glance and casually waved his hand to block it.</p><br/><p>Boom! The spiral-shaped flames that shot towards Rody were blocked with a single hand! The flames then split apart and disintegrated. Ni Lin looked solemn. His attack had been blocked right in front. Despite Nilin's ferocious and frightening expression, he could not move an inch forward!</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and said, \"You are already very powerful. You know how to utilize the rules to obtain an advantage! Unfortunately, you do not know how to \u2018create\u2019 your own rules!\"</p><br/><p>Rody heaved a sigh and moved his hand outwards lightly. Immediately, Ni Lin\u2019s huge body fell and flew backward. He rolled several times in the air before he landed on his feet. Two deep cavities appeared where he landed. Ni Lin looked surprised. He could feel a bone-piercing cold from his opponent\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>Cold? Hell! It was a cold feeling!</p><br/><p>Rody looked at the jumping sparks in his palm with a dignified expression. He closed his eyes and softly said, \"In this world, there is a type of humans who are closest to the Gods. This is because they could create their own space within God's world! They could break the old rules in their own domain and re-create their own new rules! These people, they are called\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He suddenly opened his eyes and smiled lightly, \"Domain Masters!\"</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s eyes suddenly showed a strange vigor. He suddenly pointed the index finger of his other hand and drew a few strokes in the air!</p><br/><p>The jumping sparks in the other hand instantly solidified into ice!</p><br/><p>The sparkling clear ice crystal that appeared in his hand gave off a slight chill as it floated unhurriedly in the scorching hot dragon boundary.</p><br/><p>The flames continued to rage all around, but the ice crystal did not melt at all.</p><br/><p>Rody looked at the heat waves surrounding the gently floating ice crystal and tears started to flow from the corners of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Master Autumn, I finally understand what you have told me!</p><br/><p>The feeble chill from the ice crystal then exploded!</p><br/><p>The icy-cold chill then grew and spread very quickly and the violent flame tongues surging in the heat waves instantly solidified and became ice!</p><br/><p>The sounds of the ice condensing fizzed and hissed non-stop as the transformation continued to spread. Ni Lin\u2019s mouth gaped open as he watched the dragon boundary he created with his own dragon aura, instantly turned into a world of snow and ice!</p><br/><p>The spreading chill had reached his body and he heard fizzing and hissing sounds. He then found his feet frozen to the ground!</p><br/><p>\"What is going on?\" Ni Lin roared angrily.</p><br/><p>Rody smiled as the ice crystal fell onto his palm. He then made a few light strokes with the index finger of his other hand and the ice flower disintegrated and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\"I broke your rules and created my own space! In this space, the rules must obey me! That is because this is my \u2018domain\u2019!\" Rody smiled happily and pointed to his own nose. \"My place, my rules!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Domain!</p><br/><p>Domain power!</p><br/><p>Ni Lin\u2019s roar seemed as though it was cut halfway by an invisible blade as he looked at his opponent with surprise. The Black Veil Saint was also surprised. She gazed at Rody\u2019s back, her face incredulous yet pleasantly surprised. Augustine was deathly pale as he dumbly looked at his own sword. He murmured the words Rody had said earlier. \"Rules\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark was standing on top of the cliff with his body halfway over it. He seemed to exhale after a long time and then looked back at Seth and said, \"He really does have a strong domain power!\"</p><br/><p>Seth who had been laughing since earlier then fell into deep thought. \"Rules\u2026Rules\u2026\" He then raised his head and looked at Old Mark with a meaningful smile. \"Rules. What an extremely marvelous name!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026I don't believe this!\" Ni Lin suddenly screamed. Blazing flames once again erupted from his body and the ice that froze his feet to the ground shattered. Once again, he shot towards Rody like a whirlwind.</p><br/><p>The Fire Dragon's strength was really extraordinary. Like a shooting star, he reached in front of Rody in a single breath.</p><br/><p>Time then stopped!</p><br/><p>The entire space seemed to distort a little. Ni Lin's attack suddenly stopped, like pieces of ice, frozen in this space! His large body remained in an attacking posture but motionless in front of Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody raised a single finger slowly and then placed it on Ni Lin\u2019s forehead...</p><br/><p>Immediately, a blood arrow shot out from the back of his head. Blood and brain matter sprayed out and turned to ice!</p><br/><p>Time continued to move again and Ni Lin\u2019s large body suddenly crashed onto the ground at Rody\u2019s feet. His corpse was just behind the line that Rody had drawn.</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and turned around to look at the kneeling and deathly pale Ice Dragon that was in a daze. He then softly said, \"Looks like it is no longer necessary to fight.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

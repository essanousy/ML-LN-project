It seemed the depth was endless. However, Rody immediately felt something extremely strange the moment he walked into the cave.</p><br/><p>Every step was earthshaking!</p><br/><p>The entrance of the cave was just a camouflage. It was not a mountain cave. It was a door!</p><br/><p>If it was not because Rody was fully aware that he was not dreaming, he would have believed that he was dreaming about going to heaven.</p><br/><p>Even though Rody had experienced a lot of things that were frightening to the common people, he could feel a shuddering agitation in his heart the moment he walked through the door. His normal steadfast confidence was immediately shaken!</p><br/><p>\"Is\u2026is this an illusion?\"</p><br/><p>Rody bit his lips and looked at the unimaginable scene that appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Rody told himself\u2026</p><br/><p>'I just entered a mountain cave. Even though it is a really large sacred mountain\u2026Even if you emptied out this mountain, it is impossible for there to be a vast sea of clouds!'</p><br/><p>When he stepped forward, the dark walls of the mountain vanished. There were clouds all around him. The clouds flashed with a golden light as if the mist curled up and appeared in front of Rody.</p><br/><p>What made Rody surprised was that he was supposed to be standing on the ground. However, when he looked down, he only saw an endless sea of clouds!</p><br/><p>It was as if they were standing and walking in the sky!</p><br/><p>\"This is definitely an illusion!\" Rody suddenly turned to look behind him. He saw a circular hole behind him.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>The person who shouted was Nedis. After all, she was a girl. The moment she saw such a strange scene when she entered the cave, she could not help but cry out.</p><br/><p>Sith was also stunned. He looked around as though his eyeballs were going to fall out. A frenzied excitement could be seen in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The three of them were speechless as they looked at each other with extremely astonished expressions.</p><br/><p>They had not expected to see something so beautiful, like in a fairytale, after entering the cave.</p><br/><p>\"Are\u2026\" Nedis\u2019 voice was hoarse from surprise. \"Are we walking on the clouds?\"</p><br/><p>Her voice trembled in trepidation. She did not dare to take another step, fearing that she would fall down. The sea of clouds below them looked endless.</p><br/><p>Rody was the first to calm down. He lowered his voice and said, \"This place is weird!\"</p><br/><p>He looked around vigilantly and continued, \"Even if you fumble around, you would not know how big this place is. If we walk around too far, we would not be able to find this exit.\"</p><br/><p>Sith also gradually calmed down. He narrowed his eyes and looked around.</p><br/><p>Rody held Nedis, trying to calm her down. He pointed to the distance and said, \"Do you see those clouds of light?\"</p><br/><p>The light-clouds seemed to fluctuate. A light-mist flickering with splendor seemed to spread into a vast distant space. It looked beautiful like a silk painting but it was actually moving. At the moment, there was nothing fixed that could be used as a reference. Some clouds moved quickly and some moved slowly. The clouds also gradually changed shape. If one were to look at it for a long time, they would become intoxicated by the sight and gradually forget where they were standing.</p><br/><p>It could be imagined that if they were to leave the entrance, they would not be able to find a way back when the cloud changed.</p><br/><p>Sith sighed. \"This is a really fascinating trap.\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed. However, his laugh seemed to have a profound meaning. He suddenly asked, \"Is this trap really so simple?\"</p><br/><p>He narrowed his eyes and glared at Sith. He then slowly said, \"Master Sith, have you heard of this?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked at his eyes and said, \"It cannot see the sky. It cannot see the earth. It cannot see people.\"</p><br/><p>Sith\u2019s expression froze. His eyes showed his surprised expression. Trembling, he asked, \"You\u2026you know about that?\"</p><br/><p>Rody slowly said, \"You have never told me what the dwarfs are keeping here. Now that we are standing at this secret place, I believe it is time you told me the truth?\"</p><br/><p>Sith took a deep breath and gave a wry smile. \"You\u2026Tell me first. Where did you hear those words? Who was the one who told you?\"</p><br/><p>Rody did not reply. Instead, he lowered his head as if lost in thought.</p><br/><p>After a while, Rody raised his head and mumbled. \"Ah, this place is inside the mountain. Naturally, it cannot see the sky. Besides that, there is a large illusion here, surrounding the entire place with clouds. This must be referring to the \u2018cannot see earth\u2019. Hmph. Now, I am wondering what \u2018cannot see people\u2019 means.\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked up again and stared at Sith as he said, \"This place is very scary. We do not even know what other strange things we would encounter. It may be extremely dangerous. Master Sith. Do you still think you need to hide things from me?\"</p><br/><p>Sith sighed. He then became resolute and said, \"Alright. I will tell you. The dwarfs from long ago left something at this place. It is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, a gentle and pleasant voice was heard from outside.</p><br/><p>\"It is something that makes the Temple uneasy!\"</p><br/><p>A single person then came in from outside the entrance.</p><br/><p>That person was slender and his white robes fluttered. The man looked dusty as he walked in. However, when one looked past him, they could feel a spring breeze. When one looked at his eyes, they would feel respectful. His gaze made him look holy and dignified. He had long black hair that was tied up with a silk sash at the back of his head. He wore a silver mask on his face.</p><br/><p>The mask covered most of his face and only exposed the mouth. His lips seemed to curve upwards as if he was always smiling.</p><br/><p>He casually walked in and ignored the surprised expression of the other three. He walked inside the mysterious illusion as if it was his own backyard.</p><br/><p>Rody looked at the person that just came in and narrowed his eyes. \"You!\"</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s lips raised as if he was smiling and replied, \"You don\u2019t have to glare at me like this. I did not come here to fight you.\"</p><br/><p>He paused for a while, then he laughed bitterly. \"I am quite badly injured from the battle with you earlier today. My injury has not healed.\"</p><br/><p>He then casually walked in between the three of them without taking any precautions. It was as if Rody and the other two were his companions.</p><br/><p>He was immediately bewildered by the surroundings and sighed.</p><br/><p>Rody stared at this person. He understood that this person also has domain powers and was as powerful as him. The battle outside that day had caused both of them to suffer.</p><br/><p>\"You have been following us?\" Rody narrowed his eyes as his eyes turned cold.</p><br/><p>Nedis asked in an even more straightforward manner. \"Who are you?\"</p><br/><p>Sith had already begun preparing a spell. He and Nedis stood on both sides with that man in the middle.</p><br/><p>That person did not seem to care. He looked at Rody and said, \"I truly did not misjudge you. You have really lived up to my expectations by removing the sorcery array outside.\"</p><br/><p>Rody coldly replied, \"Today, you have told me that it cannot see the sky, it cannot see the earth and it cannot see people. Did you tell me that deliberately? Or\u2026\" Rody\u2019s tone became awe-inspiring as he added, \"Did you deliberately lure me here so that I could help you remove that sorcery array and act as your pioneer?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha\u2026\" The man was startled and then laughed. He lightly said, \"Do you really think that? Then let me tell you. First of all, I really did deliberately lure you here. However, I had no intention of using you to open the way for me. Just think for a moment. I may not be able to defeat you on my own. However, you have another two companions now. Do you think I would lure you here? What would the purpose be? Do you think I could even be a threat?\"</p><br/><p>That person seemed calm and indifferent as he continued, \"Second, I did not see what you did to that array. However, it is just a God-ranked lethal trap1 array. I have already, once, destroyed that one ten years ago.\"</p><br/><p>\"What did you say?\" Rody was surprised.</p><br/><p>That person smiled behind the mask as he looked at Rody. He slowly said, \"You did not hear me wrong. That sorcery array, has been destroyed by me ten years ago. I have also entered this dream-like place ten years ago!\"</p><br/><p>Translator's Notes: </p><br/><p>1.  jiao sha. Individually it means twist/entangle, kill. Joined together, it means strangle. A literal translation of that trap would be \u2018God ranked strangling array.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

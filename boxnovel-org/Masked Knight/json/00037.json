Rody missed it and therefore she came looking for Rody. For some reason, when the seductress came looking for her brother, Nicole immediately became furious. Although she held her temper and talked to the seductress for a long time, she became angrier the more she heard. Finally, she heard that the seductress and Rody had arranged a meeting. However, Rody missed the appointment so, she decided to look for Rody. In the end, Nicole was unable to contain her anger and wanted to get even with Rody.</p><br/><p>But why am I angry?</p><br/><p>Even if it is that woman\u2026 it is my brother\u2019s fault. It has nothing to do with Rody\u2026 so why am I getting angry?</p><br/><p>Is it because it is Rody?</p><br/><p>Or is it because, that night, Rody actually contacted her and made an appointment\u2026. That bastard really had the audacity to make an appointment with that seductress!</p><br/><p>Nicole who was unable to contain her anger immediately rushed to find fault with Rody. However, the moment she entered the room, she saw Rody calmly looking at her. His calm blue eyes were as if he could see through her.</p><br/><p>Nicole\u2019s anger immediately flew away and her heart felt weak. She had come to vent her anger towards Rody but now she just stood there and was unable to make eye contact.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are finally willing to see me, Nicole.\u201d Rody tried to suppress his excited feelings and slowly walked forward.</p><br/><p>He then suddenly grabbed Nicole's hand. Nicole trembled as though she was suddenly struck by lightning. She wanted to move back but Rody held her hand tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go\u2026\u201d Her voice did not sound like she was struggling. Rather, it would be better to say that it sounded more like pleading.</p><br/><p>Rody's face also turned red. Although they had close contact before, the first time was when Nicole was unconscious due to Rody's philandering and the second time was when both of them were emotionally agitated. Rody felt a strange kind of feeling when he caught hold of Nicole's hand: it felt like they were lovers.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Rody barely used his strength and soon eased his grip. Nicole quickly took a step back in fear of Rody\u2019s next move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come to find me so suddenly? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d Nicole was stunned for a moment. She then remembered the reason she looked for him. She resented her own failure to control herself and also her inability to understand her own timidness and anger. Without the courage to look at Rody\u2019s face she whispered, \u201cThat Jojo\u2026 She came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s hands immediately started to sweat. He had personally experienced the bewitching powers of Jojo. To a boy like him, Nicole and Angel had a young charm but Jojo was like a witch. On top of that, she was also the playboy\u2019s old lover. She would probably see through his disguise in no time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do? Why did she come here? Could it be she has already learned of my identity?\u201d Rody rubbed his hands and gave a wry smile.</p><br/><p>When she spoke of Jojo, Nicole\u2019s bashful feelings all but disappeared. She stared at Rody coldly and said, \u201cWhy? Of course, it is for you! I did not know that you two already arranged a meeting that night. Is it true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and looked disgruntled when he suddenly remembered the words Jojo said to him just before he left that day, \u2018There will be no one at my house tomorrow night.\u2019 The moment he understood the meaning of that sentence along with Jojo\u2019s seductive appearance, Rody\u2019s face turned red.</p><br/><p>After Nicole carefully finished listening to what Rody had to say, her complexion became heavier. She tilted her head to one side as if she was pondering deeply and seemed preoccupied with her thoughts.</p><br/><p>Rody thought that Nicole suspected he was in a relationship with Jojo and immediately waved his hands. \u201cNicole, do not think too much. I\u2026 I have nothing to do with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole gave a strange smile and lightly said, \u201cOf course, it has nothing to do with you. Who is Jojo? The person she likes is a playboy like Seth. She won\u2019t even look at a fool like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and mumbled, \u201cYes, I am a fool. In your heart, I am just an insignificant fool.\u201d That implication made him quite depressed.</p><br/><p>Seeing Rody unhappy, Nicole's heart softened. She spoke in a small voice, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not it\u2026 You are not\u2026 not a big fool.\u201d As she said this, Nicole suddenly burst into laughter. Her laughter was like a blooming flower. Rody looked straight at Nicole\u2019s eyes feeling quite silly. He had never seen Nicole laugh like this before.</p><br/><p>Suddenly noticing Rody's gaze, Nicole became bashful again as she stomped her feet angrily. \"You!\" Nicole only managed to shout out a single word when she noticed Rody's infatuated eyes. She was then unable to speak anymore.</p><br/><p>They gazed into each others\u2019 eyes and fell into a delicate mood when they abruptly heard the sound of people talking outside the door.</p><br/><p>They could only hear the sound of arguing outside. Then with a loud cry, the door was pushed open and a fiery red figure rushed in.</p><br/><p>The two were immediately frightened and separated. Nicole was so afraid that she moved back towards the wall.</p><br/><p>The person who arrived was the gorgeous woman, Jojo.</p><br/><p>After that night, Jojo waited for Rody the following day and was very angry when Rody did not appear. She had high standards and thought that all the nobles in the Empire were useless. Some nobles indulged in exaggeration while others were militaristic and boorish. The rest were worthless people infatuated with her beauty. But then, she got acquainted with Seth. Seth admired her so much. Jojo, herself, was amazed at Seth\u2019s endless amount of knowledge. Seth was a master of love and knew how to capture a girl\u2019s heart. Together with his good looks, he managed to win Jojo\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>To be able to make even Jojo grieve was a testimony of Seth\u2019s skills as a playboy. He fooled around with so many women and would become indifferent after some time. Although Jojo was angry, Seth did not show his face. She also felt troubled. She did not expect to meet her lover at the banquet only for him to run away after only saying a few words. Seth was also missing on the night of the meeting. Jojo was an arrogant and proud person. After feeling dejected for so many days, she finally decided to go to their house.</p><br/><p>After meeting and talking with Nicole for a while, Nicole suddenly became angry and left to find Seth. Jojo continued to sit down for a while but she was also impatient and soon rushed in as well. The Tulip Family may have servants and guards but they also knew of Jojo\u2019s status. Even those who did not would not dare to block her when they saw her noble clothing. The ones who did block her did not put in much effort. Just like that, Jojo made her way to Rody\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>Rody saw Jojo standing in front of him and felt nervous. He could see Jojo wearing red fur clothing. The elegant garment highlighted her arrogant figure. Unfortunately, her charming face was not as charming as usual. It looked as if she did not eat well the past few days. She was sad and stared at Rody with resentful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeth! Why did you ignore me for so many days!\u201d Jojo stood in front of Rody for a while before she slowly spoke. Her voice was filled with sorrow. Her soft voice sounded delicate and charming.</p><br/><p>Rody started to sweat on his forehead. He did not know how to answer and looked at Nicole. Nicole had a strange expression and avoided eye contact with Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and could only answer, \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jojo noticed Rody\u2019s cold attitude, her heart became more distressed. She gritted her teeth and said, \u201cI have already told your sister about our relationship. How do you intend to reply me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s heart felt more tensed. He once again glanced at Nicole to find her looking impassive and avoiding eye contact.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I am busy these days\u2026\u201d Rody hesitated for a while. He had forced himself to utter that sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you busy with?\u201d Jojo spoke resentfully. In the Imperial Capital, there were countless nobles infatuated by her beauty yet, she refused to look at any of them. Still, the fellow in front of her was so indifferent towards her!!</p><br/><p>Rody felt like it was becoming harder to speak. \u201cYou know\u2026 I, I... in a few days, I will need to take His Majesty\u2019s examination to inherit the family\u2019s title. So for the past few days, I have been learning from a few teachers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jojo\u2019s expression grew gentler. Although she could not see Seth, she paid attention to every action. She had heard about the Tulip Family hiring many instructors and teachers to teach the young master. Rody\u2019s story sounded reasonable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why did you not visit me that night?\u201d When Jojo said this, she could not help but glance at Nicole with a red face.</p><br/><p>Rody braced himself and said, \u201cI\u2026\u201d He glanced at Nicole again but it seemed that Nicole was determined to not give him any suggestions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d Jojo\u2019s mouth fell, her eyes were filled with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was practicing martial arts!\u201d Rody impulsively blurted out. The moment he said this, he found an excuse and lied smoothly, \u201cMy instructor told me that my foundation was terrible. Before the examination, I need to work hard and if possible, not become\u2026 intimate\u2026 with women\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said this, Jojo blushed. Nicole suddenly coughed. She also did not expect Rody to suddenly give such an impressive excuse.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

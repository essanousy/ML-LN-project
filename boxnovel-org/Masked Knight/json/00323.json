Everybody was gradually stripping away the last layer of pretense, and various contradictions were now on the table.</p><br/><p>Pope Corsica VI had publicly announced that the Imperial order to stop religious taxation was a challenge against the church's prestige, a disrespect to the Gods. At the same time, the church's Flaming Warriors were frequently mobilized and assembled.</p><br/><p>However, the old skeleton was even more ruthless. He issued an order in the name of the Empire's Emperor, that any mobilization of local armies within the empire which involved more than one hundred people must obtain the approval of the imperial commander-in-chief! After such order was issued, the mobilization of the Flaming Warriors was greatly restricted. In some places, hundreds of cases of friction between the Flaming Warriors and local garrisons were reported. All of a sudden, the empire was glutted with countless news of chaos.</p><br/><p>In the midst of the dangerous undercurrent, the Duke of the Tulip Family ordered the suspension of all leaves of the Lightning God's Whip and to be in full alert awaiting orders to set out!</p><br/><p>Marquis Rody, the Regimental Commander of the Northern Army, ordered the suspension of all leaves within his army and be in full alert awaiting orders to set out!</p><br/><p>Earl Elliot, the Regimental Commander of the Northwestern Army, ordered his army to stand by and wait for orders, be in full alert awaiting orders to set out!</p><br/><p>General Camus, Regimental Commander of Southern Army, ordered the transfer of two troops of heavily armored cavalries to move up north towards the imperial city!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at the eastern territories of the empire where the church was most powerful, 30 thousand men from the Flaming Warriors successfully broke through the blockade of the empire's local garrison and gathered. They had also conquered two medium-sized cities and issued orders to expel the imperial officials stationed there under the name of His Majesty the Pope. They declared that they would temporarily take over cities in the name of God.</p><br/><p>This caused an uproar in the empire!</p><br/><p>\"Young man, do you know that believers in any religion are made up of three different groups of people?\" The old skeleton smiled cheerfully. He then slowly raised his finger and continued at a slow pace, \"The first type are those absolutely pious religious fanatics. These people are our toughest enemy... but luckily, the numbers of these type of people are not many! Among ten thousand believers, this kind of fanatics does not even account for one percent! The second group of people are those who waver easily. These are the people who embrace the church but are not fanatical. Most of them have this attitude of 'if you believe, then it works; but if you don't, then it will not work'. These kind of people, although they look pious during normal days, when their personal gain is involved, they will abandon their faith to safeguard their own interests! For example, if they have to take out a small amount of their income to worship the church, they may be willing to do so, but if they have to offer all their properties and reputation as a tribute, these people will definitely cower. Fortunately, the scandal regarding the church that we created in the Westwood Province had, to a great extent, caused the loyalty of this group of people towards the religion to drop dramatically. This type of people from the second group accounts for the most among the believers of the religion. They are the largest group in a religion. We can say that these people account for more than seventy percent of the believers in the religion of God!\"</p><br/><p>The old skeleton paused and took a few breaths before continuing, \"The third group are those pseudo-believers. Don't be surprised, this is very normal! The church has been operating in the empire for centuries. They have flourished and expanded in scale. Believing in the religion has become a habit, a trend! There are many who are originally atheists, but when they saw those around them embrace the religion, they then became believers with the psychology of 'joining in the fun'. This type of people make up quite a large portion in the religion of God, but their loyalty towards the religion is the lowest! Once the empire and the church become enemies, in consideration of their personal interests, they will abandon their religion without hesitation.\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded and smiled, \"So, even though the church claims that they have tens of millions of believers in the empire, it's actually not that terrifying!\"</p><br/><p>\"Correct,\" the old skeleton smiled, \"Tens of millions of believers was just a falsely exaggerated figure. Once the Empire and the Church become enemies, those who are willing to rise in revolt with the Church will never exceed hundreds of thousands. And among these hundreds of thousands, the true Flaming Warriors does not even amount up to half the sum. The remaining are just ignorant civilians! As long as we use drastic measures\u2026 it is not hard to solve this problem!\"</p><br/><p>Rody was silent for a moment. He then said in a low voice, \"But still, there are hundreds and thousands of people...When such chaos breaks out, how many will die, and how many families\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The old skeleton shook his head, \"The church has become an enormous malignant tumor on the empire's body! If we do not seize this opportunity to finish them off completely, when their power expands and their foundation deepens in the future, then it will be even more difficult to get rid of them! The Roland Continent is the best example!\"</p><br/><p>Seth, who was seated at a corner, was looking out of the window with a smile on his face all the while. When he heard their conversation, he turned his head and his gaze fell on the old skeleton, \"I think we still need a triggering factor to strike, what do you think?\"</p><br/><p>\"We already have that!\" Andy took out a military report from his sleeve.</p><br/><p>The following was the report from General Camus, Regimental Commander of the Southern Army:</p><br/><p>\"Acting under the orders of the Emperor, the Southern Army has conducted a massive search on all religious institutes and churches of the three provinces in the south. We have discovered large amounts of money amounting up to 1 million and 90 thousand gold coins of questionable origin! Properties and land deeds of unknown source amounting up to 2 million and 200 thousand gold coins! Among those arrested from the church were three local bishops, nine high-ranking clergymen, 28 medium-ranking clergymen and 160 low-ranking clergymen. During the period of search, the Southern Army had some friction with the Flaming Warriors. There were 620 casualties reported in the Southern Army. Among them, there were 190 dead, 300 heavily injured, and 130 mildly injured. 1,080 men from the Flaming Warriors were killed, and 2,600 people were held captive. General Camus, Regimental Commander of the Southern Army, reports to His Majesty that the situation in the south is chaotic. The church is inciting the civilians to create chaos. There have already been a total of 21 cases of friction between the Flaming Warriors and the Empire's local garrisons.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't you think this is sufficient to light the fuse?\" The old skeleton smiled and took out another piece of paper, \"This is the order I have drafted. I'm preparing to send this to the South today!\"</p><br/><p>\"In lieu of the increasing crisis in the three southern provinces, I hereby order General Camus, Regimental Commander of the Southern Army, to declare the three southern provinces as war zones and implement the code of war! General Camus is appointed as the supreme commander in the war zone! At the same time, pass down the orders of temporarily banning all religious activities in the three southern provinces! General Camus has the authority to kill those who defy the orders!\" Rody sighed when he finished reading this order. He shook his head and said, \"It seems like you're preparing to strike first in the south? Seems like a good move. Regimental Commander Camus of the south is very experienced, has great capabilities, and is also very prestigious in the south. Besides that, he is very loyal to the empire and at the same time a non-believer. He is indeed a good candidate.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is still not enough!\" Seth suddenly interrupted again, \"How's the situation of the church in the imperial city? Corsica VI did not make any other moves?\" He looked as if he was sneering, \"By the time your orders arrive in the south, the internal war would have already erupted! Corsica VI will, for sure, immediately leave the imperial city and head towards the eastern region of the empire, the stronghold of the church!\"</p><br/><p>When he said that, the three of them exchanged glances and whispered simultaneously, \"We shall strike first! Kill him!\"</p><br/><p>The old skeleton smiled and said, \"The old Pope's God's Vanquishing Spell is no joke. Even a Domain Master will not necessarily be his match. We still need to discuss this\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Hatred leached from Rody's eyes, and he said lightly, \"We have Fatty, a Domain Master, and also me and Royal Concubine Rulan, a Sacred Swordsman and a Paladin. We also have Black Veil, and not to forget Old Mark. We should be able to get rid of that fellow!\"</p><br/><p>Seth nodded and agreed, \"But we cannot do that in the imperial city! We can get rid of him halfway, and then...\"</p><br/><p>An evil grin spread across the old skeleton's face, \"And then put the blame on the Vampire Tribe...\"</p><br/><p>Seth looked at the old skeleton and smiled, \"That's right. Erm\u2026 It's best that we disclose this news to the Vampire Tribe beforehand so that they can do their part\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The two despicable conspirators, one young and one old, started to draw up their plans. Rody was bored listening to them, so he stood up and left to look for Fatty for training.</p><br/><p>At the core of the Empire's church, in the inner hall of the religious institute within the imperial city.</p><br/><p>The Pope, Corsica VI looked so much older. His eyes looked as if they were closed, but occasionally there was a sharp look in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Several senior elders from the church clad in white robes sat in front of him.</p><br/><p>\"The development of the matter has become apparent. The Empire is preparing to strike at us this time!\" The pope finally opened his mouth \u2014 his tone had traces of anger, \"The internal war of the Rolands up north seems to have awakened the empire's royals. They want to take this opportunity to eradicate the Church.\"</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty,\" an elder spoke up, \"It is meaningless for us to continue staying in the imperial city. Currently, in the eastern region of the empire, our Flaming Warriors has conquered two cities and taken control of a province. We should immediately go there before the royals openly turn against us! And then we shall build a parish there to fight against the empire!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" another elder chimed in, \"The church has the deepest foundation in the eastern region! We have countless devout believers there, and also tens of thousands of courageous Flaming Warriors! We should go there immediately, and announce to the whole empire about the crime of the royals betraying the Gods! Then we shall start a great holy war to defend the Gods!\"</p><br/><p>The Pope, Corsica VI finally opened his eyes. His gaze swept across all those in the room and sighed, \"Is this what you all have agreed upon?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was silent, but they looked straight at the Pope.</p><br/><p>\"All right!\" Corsica VI stood up and waved the wand in his hand, \"Since they want war, then we will give them war! Pass down my doctrine and announce that the royals of the Radiant Empire are heretics who blasphemed against the Gods! The church will lead all the believers in the empire to wage war against these heretics!\"</p><br/><p>He paused, then said in a low voice, \"We will leave the imperial city tomorrow! But my doctrine should only be issued after three days.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

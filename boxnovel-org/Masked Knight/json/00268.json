Amongst the three of you, you are the real leader!\"</p><br/><p>Rody smiled and did not comment.</p><br/><p>Yukinari became more confident of his thoughts and sternly asked, \"I would like to ask you. Is your robbery instigated by my brother Kikukawa Koichi? In the end, what is your purpose?\"</p><br/><p>Before Rody could reply, Nedis asked, \"Why did you think it to be like this?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari coldly laughed, \"Only he would be anxious for me to die. Once I am dead, there would be nobody to compete for the inheritance of that position! Hmph!\"</p><br/><p>Rody, Nedis, and Sith looked at each other. Nedis laughed without confirming or denying his suspicions. She lightly said, \"What are your intentions by telling us this?</p><br/><p>\"I want to buy you over,\" Yukinari said in a straightforward manner. \"How much is my brother giving you? I can give you ten times that amount as long as you are willing to cooperate with me!\"</p><br/><p>Rody secretly sighed. Yukinari looked quite smart but when he spoke, he could not avoid revealing the bungling oaf in himself. Even if he wanted to do so, buying others so openly was inappropriate.</p><br/><p>Rody was not a cunning man but he had become quite knowledgeable in the past few days. He was no longer the soft-spoken and timid youth. Sith, the old sorcerer, was also a crafty scoundrel and Nedis was even worse than him.</p><br/><p>With these three around, Yukinari did not have any chance at all. Nedis easily made Yukinari reveal everything.</p><br/><p>They found out that Yukinari was the youngest son of the Hakone Kingdom\u2019s Shogun1. He had one elder brother, Koichi. Their ages differed by three years.</p><br/><p>However, they did not have the same mother. This generation\u2019s Shogun, Ieyasu Kikukawa, had two wives. However, Koichi\u2019s mother had already died from illness.</p><br/><p>Yukinari was fair skinned and handsome. He was considerably well liked by the old Shogun. Besides that, his mother had always bragged about him to the Shogun. This made the Shogun, Kikukawa Ieyasu, favor the younger son more.</p><br/><p>Besides that, Yukinari\u2019s brother, Koichi, was no ordinary man. If it was said that Yukinari had inherited his mother\u2019s beauty, then Koichi was the one who had inherited the Shogun\u2019s bravery. The twenty-five-year-old Koichi was tall and robust. He was a very rare warrior amongst the dwarves. On top of that, he was resolute and decisive. This natural born warrior received the support of the old Shogun\u2019s retainers. That was why the elder son was much more powerful than the Yukinari that only knew literary works.</p><br/><p>In the competition for the inheritance, the officials of the shogunate supported Koichi. They did not say anything even though the old Shogun preferred the sensible and intelligent younger son.</p><br/><p>On top of that, as speculated by Rody and the others, even though the old Shogun loved his younger son, he seemed to be very clear that his youngest son was not leader material. One way of saying it was that Yukinari and Seth were similar.</p><br/><p>They were both playboys. He might be proficient in poetry, but his real ability was one level lower than Koichi.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Koichi had already been the Commander of an army at a young age. This was why Yukinari went to River Home and ended up meeting Rody. His mother was anxious about her treasured son when she saw that Koichi had already taken control of the military power. She then encouraged him to do something decent.</p><br/><p>Yukinari\u2019s purpose at River Home was for the inspection of the town and the supplies being delivered to the frontlines. This was something simple and could be done by a lower ranked person. The Young Master only needed to take a look and then go back home. This was enough to give him, in name at least, a little bit of ability and experience on the field.</p><br/><p>However, Rody and the others were not interested in this.</p><br/><p>Their purpose was to find out what the thing the dwarfs had that could threaten the Temple. But no matter how Nedis probed, Yukinari did not seem to know anything about it.</p><br/><p>The three of them then looked at each other helplessly. This was not something common; it was an important secret. Being only a local official's son. the Young Master presumably did not know anything about it.</p><br/><p>Yukinari had already said everything but the three of them still did not want to declare their identities. He felt a little bit anxious. Although Yukinari was not too capable, he grew up in the shogunate and could at the very least see the sinister gaze of others.</p><br/><p>He could feel with his intuition that the three people in front of him were not common but were all top-grade people. The beautiful woman had cunning eyes and was very smart. Although the old man was quiet, his speech was imposing. Besides that, his hand was always placed on top of a stick when he walked even though he walked normally and did not need crutches. This would not be a problem if it happened to normal people. However, Yukinari was not a common person. Although there were no sorcerers in the Hakone Kingdom, he had seen a sorcerer before. The old man was not holding a crutch but a sorcerer\u2019s staff.</p><br/><p>As for this young man, Yukinari felt he was extremely mysterious.</p><br/><p>Sitting beside the youth constantly made him feel uneasy. It was like the murderous aura of his father, a brave warrior and a leader that commands a mighty army. However, the young man\u2019s aura was even more intense than his father\u2019s. When the youth\u2019s expression sank as he spoke, Yukinari could feel cold sweat coming out of his pores. It was a very realistic feeling of oppression.</p><br/><p>\"The three of you. Are you interested in my proposal?\" Yukinari asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\"No,\" Rody replied in an extremely simple manner. \"I have no interest in your proposal.\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari became anxious. \"Are you not satisfied with my conditions? What did my brother promise you? Just say it, I will give you ten times more than him\"</p><br/><p>Nedis suddenly smiled and said, \"Your brother promised us that once he becomes the Shogun, he would give us the authority to monopolize the ironwood business. Could you do that?\"</p><br/><p>When Nedis said that, Yukinari did not show any reactions. Rody and the old sorcerer was surprised. Rody even called out, \"Nedis!\"</p><br/><p>Nedis ignored Rody and repeated, \"Can you accept this condition?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari immediately said without hesitation, \"Of course! This is nothing! When I become the Shogun in the future, I can promise you anything you want!\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed in his heart. Although he did not know Nedis\u2019 intentions, Yukinari\u2019s reply made him laugh bitterly. This guy was really not a leader. No wonder he was unable to compete against his brother Koichi.</p><br/><p>Ironwood was fundamental to the dwarfs\u2019 survival. Yet, he had sold it out without even any thought.</p><br/><p>Nedis signaled for Rody not to speak. She whispered and continued, \"Alright, young master. The three of us are not from your country. We are from the Roland Continent\u2019s Mercenary Association. We are also experts in that association! My name is Blood Fox Nedis. The old man is Evil Star Sith and he\u2026\" Nedis pointed to Rody and slowly said with a calm tone, \"He is the leader of the famous Black Mercenaries, Lone Wolf Rody.\"</p><br/><p>It was not just Yukinari. Even Rody and Sith\u2019s mouths were hung open.</p><br/><p>This woman was too frightening. She said so many lies without even blinking.</p><br/><p>Nedis gently coughed. Rody and Sith immediately closed their mouth and kept quiet. Although they did not understand her intentions, they did not refute her words. If there was anything, they could ask her later.</p><br/><p>Yukinari had a complicated expression but he quickly pretended to look respectful. He then said words like \"I have heard about you\" and so on.</p><br/><p>Nedis was calm as she continued, \"We came to you, naturally it is from your brother\u2019s instructions. Do you know why your brother wants us to kidnap you but not kill you?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari shook his head and replied, \"I do not know.\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed bitterly in his heart. \u2018It is not just you. I also do not know!\u2019</p><br/><p>Nedis' eyes flickered with wisdom as she said, \"Your brother wants us to kidnap you and pretend to be your follower. After that, we will assassinate your father, the Shogun.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" Yukinari and the old sorcerer exclaimed.</p><br/><p>When the old sorcerer exclaimed, he immediately and instinctively covered his mouth. Nedis secretly glared at Sith. She then casually looked back at Yukinari.</p><br/><p>Yukinari had an angry expression and did not notice the old sorcerer losing control of himself. He hatefully said, \"He! He is actually doing such things! Is he not afraid? Does he think he can escape from the criminal charge?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis showed a compassionate expression and said, \"Sigh, young master. You still have not understood it! We are ordered to pretend as your followers! After killing the Shogun, we would naturally run away. Who do you think would take the blame? When your father is dead, you would be accused of killing him and you could no longer compete for the inheritance then.\" She then purposely looked at him with thoughtful eyes.</p><br/><p>Yukinari broke out in cold sweat. He was silent for some time before saying, \"Too despicable! Too shameless!\"</p><br/><p>Rody glared at Nedis. His eyes seemed to say, \"You are also despicable and shameless.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis quickly shot Rody a disdainful look. She looked at the distracted Yukinari and asked, \"What are you going to do next?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari suddenly stood up forgetting he was inside a carriage. His head slammed into the ceiling of the carriage causing him to cry out in pain. He then grasped his head and sat down. He then angrily said, \"I want to immediately return to the capital and tell my father! I want to expose my brother\u2019s trick. Hmph! He is not my brother. He is just a bastard!\"</p><br/><p>Nedis shook her head. She sighed and said, \"Your thoughts are too simple. Koichi has planned this for a long time. What makes you think you can just report it? Think for a moment. He would deny it, and you have no evidence!\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari looked into Nedis\u2019 eyes. She immediately said, \"We obviously cannot testify for you! Even if we went, he can completely feign ignorance. At that time, will you be able to explain things clearly when he accuses you of defaming him?\"</p><br/><p>When Yukinari looked as though he does not believe it, Nedis rolled his eyes and coldly said, \"You don\u2019t believe me? Alright. Then let me ask you. Do you know about the war in the South?\"</p><br/><p>\"I know.\" Yukinari replied, \"I went to the River Home to\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Nedis waved her hand, indicating that Yukinari did not need to continue. She coldly asked, \"The Roland Continent has not fought against the Hakone Kingdom for many years. Do you know why they chose to attack now?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis deliberately stared at Yukinari. Without waiting for him to reply, she said, \"The Roland army has invaded the territory and now they have easily conquered the South. Do you know why?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari\u2019s expression changed a few times. He then asked, \"What does this have to do with my brother?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis coldly grunted and then said, \"I am asking you what benefits your brother will gain in this war? Is he assigned with military powers?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Yukinari nodded. \"My father has appointed him\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Good,\" Nedis replied as she once again stopped Yukinari. She then quickly said, \"During peacetime, your father would naturally not give the military power to others so easily. However, when the war begins, even if he has to give away military power, he would prioritize his son! That is the only way he could be assured! So, let me ask you again. Does this really have nothing to do with your brother?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari\u2019s mouth opened wide. He took a deep breath and asked, \"Could it be that my brother is colluding with the enemy?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" Nedis nodded and also looked at Yukinari with eyes of sympathy. \"I know you don\u2019t believe it, but the truth is right in front of you\u2026\" The woman said as if she was presenting conclusive evidence. \"Your brother gains the most benefits! He is not only taking this opportunity to obtain military power. Hmph. On top of that, the war right now is unfavorable to you as your brother sold the military intelligence. Let me tell you. In a few days, your brother will ask to take the initiative and lead on the frontlines! At that time, the enemy would deliberately lose according to the agreement and withdraw the troops! As a result, your brother would not only obtain military power but also gain prestige. At that time, no matter what your father does, he would already be the successor!\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari became dejected and became weak in his chair. His dispiritedly and helplessly said, \"Then\u2026I have no way left?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis immediately showed a gentle smile. It was the smile of a big bad wolf looking at a little rabbit. She said, \"Young Master Yukinari, since I have told you about this, it naturally means that I have decided to help you. I also think that your brother\u2019s way of doing things is too ruthless. Working with him makes me feel worried\u2026We work for profit. I can see you are not so bad which is why I told you about this. If you want to challenge your brother, we must first see how you are superior to your brother.\"</p><br/><p>Without batting an eyelid, Nedis said \u2018we\u2019 and thus had made themselves the same side as Yukinari's.</p><br/><p>Yukinari was not a complete idiot. After thinking for a moment, he opened his mouth and said, \"Yes. My brother is more superior than me in many places. He also has the support of the shogunate. The commanders all like him! With their support, he is definitely very influential in the military. His fighting skills are also superior!\"</p><br/><p>When Nedis saw Yukinari becoming even more depressed, she quickly waved and hurriedly said, \"We already know about this. It is better to think about places where you have an advantage.\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari became more spirited and quickly said, \"This? My mother is still alive. Because of this, my brother rarely appears at home and as a result, he is not too close to Father. Father likes me more!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hm. What else?\" Nedis continued to ask.</p><br/><p>\"There is even more\u2026I\u2026\" His face suddenly turned red as he said, \"My relationship with the Imperial Family is also good. Although the shogunate is independent of the Imperial Family, it is still necessary to have a good relationship with them. My brother is too arrogant so his relationship with the Imperial Family is not harmonious. The Emperor\u2019s young daughter is my lover.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh?\" Nedis glanced at Rody and immediately asked, \"The Imperial Family? This is a very favorable condition! Do you know much about the Imperial Family?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari sighed and closed his eyes. He had an expression as if he recalled some tender memories. \"Her Imperial Highness and I met during childhood. We have strong feelings for each other. In fact, my desire to become Shogun, half of it is because of her!\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari sighed again. He opened his eyes and gave a wry smile as he said, \"I know my own ability. I am definitely not Shogun material. My ability is far worse than my brother. I admit that if he is a Shogun, he would be much stronger than I would be. But\u2026I have no choice but to fight against him!\" Yukinari clenched his fist and hatefully said, \"I heard my father said that he wants to tie a marriage with the Imperial Family. He had reached an agreement with His Majesty to marry the successor to the Emperor\u2019s daughter! If my brother becomes the successor, then he\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Nedis showed a rare expression of sincerity in her eyes. She now felt bad for cheating him. She sighed and said, \"Are you sure you want to fight against your brother for this? With your current situation, is the Emperor willing to marry off his daughter to you?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari shook his head and said, \"At first he was willing. His Majesty seemed to prefer me as my brother is arrogant. He was once rude to the Emperor at a wine reception. Although he was later scolded by my father, his relationship with the Imperial Family did not improve. I believe that if we really competed, His Majesty would support me.\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed in his heart. With a Shogun, the seat of Emperor is just an empty position. His support would not have meant much. Besides that, the Emperor would have a motive for giving you support. As opposed to having a strong Shogun, the Royal Family would prefer an incompetent Shogun so that they would have an easier time.</p><br/><p>\"But\u2026\" Yukinari suddenly frowned and his eyebrows wrinkled. \"His Majesty\u2019s attitude became weird. Initially, he consented to my relationship with the princess. That was until last month\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At first, Rody and the others had no interest in Yukinari\u2019s private life. But his next words suddenly made their ears perk up.</p><br/><p>\"Last month, I secretly met up with the princess. Our private place was a very secret place. Ah, it was truly hard for her to follow me for the past few years. There was a forbidden place in the palace where nobody is allowed to approach. However, nobody knew that we rendezvous near that place! Following His Majesty\u2019s orders, nobody is allowed to go there and so that place has very little visitors. That was where we could meet\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Nedis\u2019 heart seemed to jump. She could not help but ask, \"A forbidden place? You all went in?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course not!\" Yukinari shook his head. \"Even if we want to go in, we would not be able to. It is a cave with a lot of warriors guarding the entrance. There are even royal mages. It is not possible for anyone to go in there. I and the princess only dared to stroll around the back of the nearby mountain. The cave was guarded but because His Majesty did not allow anyone to approach, there was nobody even around the neighborhood. It was a good spot for us to have secret rendezvous\u2026sigh...\" Yukinari sighed again. \"Unfortunately, His Majesty found out last month. He scolded us bitterly and no longer allowed us to meet.\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari grumbled in regret. The other three could no longer listen anymore. Nedis was pleased with herself and looked at Rody. She seemed to say, \"How\u2019s that? Didn\u2019t I get that information?\"</p><br/><p> Translator's Note:</p><br/><p>1. Although the word used  jiangjun is general, they also have  jiangling, which stands for high ranking military officer/general. In ancient Japan, the Shoguns are the \u2018true\u2019 military rulers. Their rankings are the equivalent of Generalissimo (Italian word), the highest ranking generale (general). Meanwhile, the jiangling here seems to serve as a simple general like General Reuben that got sacked. As the dwarves are obviously Japanese, the jiangjun referring to dwarves are Shoguns while the jiangling are just generals. The reason why these \u2018generals\u2019 are not Daimyo or Samurais is because they are not given provinces or not \u2018elite warriors\u2019 in a literal sense.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

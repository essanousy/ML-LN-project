It was an enormous structure built using granite shipped from the north. From the Empire\u2019s few centuries\u2019 worth of history, Rody learned that the Empire had gone through many hardships and wars. Rody was unable to remember them all.</p><br/><p>During the Empire\u2019s 49th year, the Empire was at war with the Northern Roland Continent and entered a moment of crisis. The granite palace became the last military stronghold. Both sides had about 200,000 soldiers and they fought at the fort of the palace for a total of 17 days. Finally, the third Duke of the Tulip Family led 100,000 soldiers that helped to repel the enemy and defend the palace.</p><br/><p>During the Empire\u2019s 109th year, there was an internal strife. The emperor was assassinated by a rebellious minister. The rebellious minister then put a prince there and controlled him like a puppet. After that, the sixth Duke of Tulip Family ran away from the Imperial Capital. Fifteen days later, he came back to the Imperial Capital with 9,000 soldiers. They took six days to break through the city walls and later fought 20,000 rebels for two days and two nights. The duke personally killed the rebellious leader, Davis and continued to attack the Imperial City with thousands of soldiers. Due to that war, the river near the walls turned red with blood for a full two weeks, before returning to its original color.</p><br/><p>During the Empire\u2019s 209th year, after the internal strife the most outstanding emperor in the whole of Empire\u2019s history, Abbas the Great ascended the throne. Abbas was the Empire\u2019s greatest emperor in their 400 years of history. However, during his reign he was also the emperor that killed the most people. Abbas had the support of the Tulip Family and killed more than 1,000 of the ministers and kinsmen that opposed his rule. That included his younger brother and his uncle. About 100 years later, the Empire once again experienced a bloody baptism. On that night, the whole Empire was filled with shrilled screams and the stench of the blood. After a heavy downpour, the whole Empire was covered in red.</p><br/><p>During the 30 years of Abbas the Great\u2019s reign, he created the Empire\u2019s formidable cavalry. The cavalry was well known in the mainland as the Lightning God Legion. Under Abbas' great leadership and the Tulip Family\u2019s outstanding commands, the cavalry conquered the entire continent. Only in the mainland at the Northwest Grasslands, was there a strong and unknown resistance from the nomads who refused to be ruled by the Empire. Abbas the Great then implemented firm strategies. \u201cIn all parts of the mainland where the sun shines, everyone must respect the imperial law and authority! The obedient ones will be rewarded while the rebellious ones will be mercilessly punished.\u201d Finally, the marshal of the Empire massacred 60,000 foreign troops and captured their leader, Halifax. Abbas the Great then ordered for this foreign leader to be publicly trampled by horses until he died.</p><br/><p>At last, the whole continent finally unified and became the Empire\u2019s territory. As a result, the Empire in the south and Roland in the north, separated by the straits, were in quite a confrontational setup. Also in that era, the Great Sage Dandong was born. He became Abbas the Great\u2019s most powerful assistant as he single handedly planned a series of reforms, giving the Empire a lot of vigor. Also in that palace, Abbas the Great renamed the Empire as the Radiant Empire1. The name of the Radiant Empire reverberated through the whole continent.</p><br/><p>Twenty-three years ago, the Empire once again went through a historical moment. It was its first defeat and humiliation after a few hundred years. The foreigners from the Northwest Grasslands raised their banners and declared independence. They then formed the Great Moon Kingdom. On top of that, the commander of the army who was Tulip Family\u2019s head died of illness. Eventually, the Empire\u2019s Central Cavalry were defeated by the Great Moon Kingdom\u2019s armored cavalry. As they were defeated, the Empire had to acknowledge the Great Moon Kingdom\u2019s independence. After that, the Empire and the Great Moon Kingdom signed an agreement in the hall constructed by Abbas the Great, agreeing to the division of their lands.</p><br/><p>Rody sat in the carriage and occasionally gazed out of the window, looking towards the palace in the distance. He recalled seeing the picture of the palace in history books. He did not know what his fate would be when he arrived there.</p><br/><p>Rody stared at the palace which was getting closer. As night drew nearer, he had a peculiar feeling.</p><br/><p>This is the heart of the Empire!</p><br/><p>The palace was surrounded by about 60 miles of wall, completely constructed with huge rocks. Its height and thickness were about the same as the wall of the Imperial Capital but its strength was much stronger. Standing on the wall were the Imperial Guards wearing golden armors and holding spears. There was also a brightly colored banner with a thorny flower, flapping in the wind. This wall was originally something built in haste during the war. A few hundred years later, an ancient emperor renovated the wall. The original castle-like wall was given a magnificent coating to make it similar to the Imperial Palace. The original iron gate was replaced with a golden gate, the symbol of the Imperial Family\u2019s dignity.</p><br/><p>As the carriage passed through the gate, Rody could not help but mentally try to calculate as to how many years of a commoner\u2019s expenses could be covered by the cost of the gate\u2019s platinum gold coating.</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of the Imperial Guards, the carriage stopped at the entrance of the inner city of the Imperial Palace. At this point, Rody had to get off the carriage. Nobody except His Majesty the Emperor was allowed to ride a carriage into the inner city.</p><br/><p>Twelve fully armed guards led the way. Rody eventually reached the audience hall. The thick and heavy door made of wood and iron was already open. Following Gordon\u2019s instructions, Rody slowly walked into the audience hall alone.</p><br/><p>The 16 huge pillars in the audience hall looked dignified. The audience hall was surrounded and illuminated by large candles, made of cattle fat. The illumination was so bright that it seemed as if it was daytime. When Rody stepped onto the floor, it gave out a soft sound. Rody noticed that the floor of the audience hall was made out of gold. On both sides of the audience hall, rows of guards in armor stood. They only revealed their eyes and they had axes in their hands. They looked straight in front and did not glance at Rody.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph,\u2026 gold. The Imperial Palace is really like what the legend said\u2026 like a cage.\u201d Rody could not help but think to himself.</p><br/><p>Gordon pointed to the door at the end of the hall and whispered, \u201cHis Majesty is in there waiting for you.\u201d He hesitated for a moment before saying again, \u201cYoung Master Seth, please give me your sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody knew he could not refuse. He gave the lightsaber to Gordon. Gordon nodded his head and passed on the sword to one of the guards at the door before walking with Rody towards the back.</p><br/><p>The two guards, at the side of the entrance, carefully interrogated Gordon. Only when Gordon produced the command plate did they allow Rody to enter.</p><br/><p>The door slowly opened and Rody immediately felt a chill.</p><br/><p>It was a side hall, which was actually the real center of the Empire. It was noted in the Empire's history, that all the important policies and strategies were agreed and fixed here by the emperor and his ministers.</p><br/><p>The inside of the hall was mostly empty. He felt a strange sense of relief from the ceiling that gave off a gentle and chilling light. Rody knew that this was an illuminating spell. There were no decorations or furnishings in the middle of the room. There was only a huge and long table in the wide, open hall. At the end of the table, there was a long and thin silhouette.</p><br/><p>He wore a long white robe and had long black hair tied up behind his head. His face looked abnormally fair as if it was devoid of color. He carefully looked at Rody with eyes which looked like two bright gems. Although the person was just quietly standing there, Rody could feel a tremendous kind of invisible pressure.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately bowed his head and knelt down. He spoke loudly, \u201cI am Tulip Family\u2019s Seth Rudolph. I present myself to His Majesty the Emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white robed person in the distance seemed motionless. He gently nodded but he did seem to have intention of allowing Rody to stand up.</p><br/><p>The current Radiant Empire Emperor quietly looked at Rody. His gaze was as if he could see through Rody. Rody did not know how long he had knelt. He could feel the cold sweat flowing down his back. After a while, he heard a clear and resounding voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeth! I have a difficult problem. I hope you can solve it for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Footnote</p><br/><p>1 The original name, gu\u0101ngm\u00edng d\u00ecgu\u00f3 meant Light Empire or Bright Empire but it sounds awkward as the name of a kingdom so I picked Radiant instead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It gave out a soft light inside the darkened room.</p><br/><p>Rody understood what it was at a glance. It was a mask! A silver mask!</p><br/><p>Nicole stood at the side and went straight to the point. \u201cPut it on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody hesitated. The previous time, he had worn that \u2018God\u2019s Smile\u2019 that literally ruined his life. What was he going to wear this time? The last time, he obtained rabbit ears. What about this time? Would he really end up with a pig\u2019s snout?</p><br/><p>Nicole looked at the panicking boy and could not help but laugh. She reassured him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! This is just an ordinary mask!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 Why should I wear this mask?\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman had done so much to change his face and now she wanted him to cover his face? Was there something wrong?</p><br/><p>Nicole was too lazy to explain to him and coldly said, \u201cBecause this is an order.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody sighed as he thought: As expected.</p><br/><p>He somewhat guessed Nicole\u2019s idea but\u2026.. Isn\u2019t that idea crazy?</p><br/><p>Nicole looked pleased with Rody\u2019s appearance after he put on the mask. Rody was tall and slender. The mask was also very exquisite, except for the unpleasant looking long ears and his long fluttering hair, it gave a confident and mysterious impression.</p><br/><p>The design of the mask was ingenious as Rody, wearing it, did not feel that it was particularly suffocating. He made a wry smile and asked, \"What do we do about the ears?\"</p><br/><p>He was very hopeful that Nicole would change his ears back but was soon disappointed.</p><br/><p>Nicole took out two objects and gave them to Rody. They were often used by the nobles in winter to cover their ears and keep them warm.</p><br/><p>Nicole gave Rody two large earmuffs and quietly told him, \u201cFold your ears and then cover them with these.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, although the ears were long, they were also soft. Rody felt a little bit of pain when he folded the ears and then covered it with the earmuffs. However, Rody did not dare to object further.</p><br/><p>Nicole went to Rody\u2019s side and carefully straightened out his hair in such a way that the hair would cover his ears. That way, it would be impossible to see anything.</p><br/><p>Rody could feel Nicole\u2019s soft hand stroking his head and could also smell the girl\u2019s fragrance. If it was not because of the light ache in his ears, everything would have been very satisfying. He even had a faint hope of extending this moment forever.</p><br/><p>Nicole looked at Rody with a satisfied expression and said, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not realize that her tone had become softer.</p><br/><p>In fact, Nicole was not a cold, unsympathetic person; whether it was at home or in the Imperial Capital. Rather than bad-tempered, Nicole was more of a gentle person. It was just that there were too many incidents in the past two days. She was attacked on the way home and was violated by Rody in the middle of the night. More importantly, her family's heir ran away from home. The young girl had to bear all the family burdens and was exhausted. As a result, she was easily irritated.</p><br/><p>Other than that day when Nicole was furious about Rody\u2019s indecent acts, Nicole did not treat the boy that was two years younger than her with much prejudice.</p><br/><p>She actually admired this big boy as he had dared to sneak into her home, regardless of his own safety, to rescue a friend. Besides that, Master Autumn also appreciated his talent in swordplay. On the other hand, she had hoped her brother had such strength in character. At the very least, she would not need to carry the family\u2019s burden on her shoulders.</p><br/><p>As for that time when Rody stole a kiss while she was unconscious\u2026urgh...she just treated him as a young and naive child. Nicole was aware of her innate beauty and that she had already captivated countless nobles in the Imperial Capital. After all, Rody was also a young man.</p><br/><p>Rody was still immersed in this moment of bliss when his hand was released by Nicole. It turned out that while he was in this dazed state, she had already led him to the yard from yesterday.</p><br/><p>When he arrived, Master Autumn was already standing in the yard.</p><br/><p>Master Autumn was dressed in gray clothes like before. His signature long white hair flowed down from both sides. This time, instead of the broadsword used for soldiers, at his waist, he was carrying a sword normally used by nobles.</p><br/><p>Rody finally turned his attention away from Nicole\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>He then noticed something peculiar about Master Autumn.</p><br/><p>Rody had met master swordsmen before, such as the teachers that teach swordsmanship in the Imperial Academy. There were also the other masters from the Imperial Capital. You could immediately identify them from the crowd.</p><br/><p>Based on Rody\u2019s impression, master swordsmen would have a certain posture that naturally projects a fierce and powerful presence. It was as if they were afraid that others do not know how strong they were.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Master Autumn was entirely different. He was just casually standing there, looking completely at ease.</p><br/><p>He was just like an ordinary person without the imposing manner of a master.</p><br/><p>Master Autumn had seen Nicole and Rody as they approached from a distance. He curiously looked at the silver mask on Rody\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Before Master Autumn could speak, Nicole explained with a smile, \u201cHis look was so special that I decided to give him a mask!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking of Rody who had a frightening countenance because of his Yin Yang face, Master Autumn gave a faint smile and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Following that he, the strongest swordsman of the Imperial Capital and the one recognized as a grandmaster of swordsmanship, did not spare any pleasantries with Nicole. He casually stated, \u201cLet us begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing his statement, he glanced at Nicole. Nicole smiled back and quietly left.</p><br/><p>Master Autumn smiled as he looked at Rody who was standing ramrod straight. He simply said, \u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous. Actually, I cannot teach you many things except some simple guides\u2026 ah... to be precise, I cannot teach you any specific moves but if you have any question about swordplay, I should be able to give you an answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody was really nervous. Master Autumn was teaching him swordplay! It was glorious! Master Autumn was the person acknowledged as the future user of the Holy Sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are there any problems?\u201d Master Autumn smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Rody quickly nodded. \u201cMaster Autumn\u2026 you\u2026 Do you have any disciples?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d Master Autumn was stunned for a moment as he did not expect Rody to ask him this question. He pondered for a moment before smiling and giving his reply, \u201cWhy did you ask me this question? But I can give you an answer. I have no disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Rody nodded. He started thinking.</p><br/><p>Master Autumn made a strange face and continued, \"Actually, I should have had an apprentice, however, before I got to meet him\u2026 before I was able to receive him as my disciple, he ran away.\"</p><br/><p>\u201cRan away?\u201d Rody shouted in disbelief.</p><br/><p>My God! There is actually such a fool! If you include the number of people who wanted to be Master Autumn\u2019s disciple, including His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s princes and the rest of the commoners, you would find that there would be at least be 3 long rows of people lining up waiting to become his apprentice. No matter how long they waited, their turn would not arrive.</p><br/><p>To think that there was an idiot who had the chance to become his disciple but did not want it.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Rody carefully asked, \u201care you willing to accept disciples in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Master Autumn said, without commitment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d Rody\u2019s voice was more careful, \u201cwhat are the prerequisites to be your disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Autumn looked deeply at Rody before he replied indifferently, \"About this, it is pointless even if you asked.\" He looked at Rody and laughed. \"I will not accept you as my disciple. There is no point in continuing this conversation.\"</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rody blurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi\u2026\u201d Master Autumn sighed lightly, \u201cI have my own reasons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody cleverly shut his mouth. Since the other party was unwilling to speak, it is better if he did not pursue the question. After all, to get Master Autumn\u2019s guidance itself was already a rare thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your curiosity has been sated, can we start now? I do not have much time so I cannot stay here for long,\u201d Master Autumn smiled. Although he had only met Rody twice, he had a good impression of the youth.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately nodded and temporarily pushed the idea of becoming his disciple to the back of his mind. He then asked, \u201cYesterday, what was the technique you used when you broke my sword? I only remembered parrying two strikes. Why did my sword break into so many pieces?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Autumn thought for a moment before asking again, \u201cYou wish to learn that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Rody nodded without hesitation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

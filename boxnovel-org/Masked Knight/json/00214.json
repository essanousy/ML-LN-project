Countless waves of black lights seemed to roll and pulverized all the skeletons in the hundred-meter pit. Even the metal armors were torn to pieces. Then, violent shockwaves blasted the surrounding walls, creating a number of deep obtrusive pits. The whole cave shook and dust and gravel fell from the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Rody tightly held Diane under him. He then released a mass of golden fighting energy and wrapped both of them inside.</p><br/><p>Finally, after some time, the surrounding movements gradually died down. Rody then shook his head to shake off the dust on his head. The original neat square pit was ruined by the rebounding Mystic Dragon Purge and thousands of skeletons had already turned into ashes.</p><br/><p>Rody then looked at Diane and saw her pretty face fully covered with dust. Diane did not show any surprise or fear at all as she held on tightly to Rody. She had a tender expression in her eyes that were difficult to describe and was smiling sweetly. She then said, \"You better not use that technique anymore. Otherwise, this whole place will collapse before you get this gate open!\"</p><br/><p>They both stood up from the ground and dusted the debris off their bodies. Rody then said while feeling vexed, \"That stone gate is really strange. Even the Mystic Dragon Purge could not blast through it.\"</p><br/><p>Diane laughed and replied, \"The Mystic Dragon is not invincible after all. Otherwise, he would not be defeated and sealed.\"</p><br/><p>Diane pulled Rody back to the front of the stone gate. The violent quake earlier had already shaken off some debris from the surrounding walls around the frame of the stone gate. Diane then walked to the side of the wall and stretched out her hand to feel the rocks all over sides of the wall. She suddenly exclaimed, \"Look, there is something up there.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing Diane\u2019s voice, Rody immediately went to her side. They then dusted off the debris from the walls.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the two of them looked surprised. There were pit marks on the entire wall, forming a huge picture.</p><br/><p>A hexagram and a variety of peculiar magic symbols were densely distributed according to a certain kind of strange pattern, forming a complete strange picture.</p><br/><p>In the middle of that picture was the stone gate.</p><br/><p>Rody took a deep breath and said, \"This looks like a sorcery array!\"</p><br/><p>Diane looked for a long time and frowned. \"Unfortunately, both of us are not sorcerers. We cannot understand this.\" Diane then sighed and said, \"Are we really going to be stranded and die here?\" After that, she gently leaned onto Rody\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s heart stirred when he felt Diane's delicate body snuggle up to him. An inexplicable tender feeling appeared deep in in his heart. He then loudly replied, \"No! We will definitely get out of here!\"</p><br/><p>He looked up at the sorcery array on the wall in front of him and laughed, \"I wonder if it is possible to get rid of this sorcery array.\" After that, Rody laughed at his own idea and shook his head, \"It should be impossible. How can sorcery array be destroyed so easily?\"</p><br/><p>Diane smiled sweetly. She then raised her head to look straight at Rody She bit her lips and asked, \"Rody\u2026if we were to die here, would you be afraid?\"</p><br/><p>Rody froze for a moment and asked softly, \"What about you? Would you be afraid?\"</p><br/><p>Diane shook her head and gave a firm smile. \"I am not afraid\u2026I will not be afraid as long as you are by my side.\"</p><br/><p>Rody was flustered by the way Diane looked at him and he could not help but avert his eyes.</p><br/><p>Diane suddenly sighed and said, \"Unfortunately, I know that although you are not afraid, you are still anxious to leave here! There are so many people waiting for your return such as Miss Nicole and Myka\u2026\" Her voice became softer and softer and finally sounded somewhat sad.</p><br/><p>Rody struggled to smile. He gently hugged Diane\u2019s shoulders and loudly said, \"Don't worry. We will definitely get out!\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked at the stone gate in front of him again and suddenly said, \"Master Autumn told me that in this world, there are always certain rules. This means that if there is a gate here, then there must be a way to open it! There are no gates in this world that cannot be opened! If there are no ways to open this gate, the people who built this place might as well just build a wall. Why did they build a gate instead? As long as there is a gate, there must be a way to open it!\"</p><br/><p>Diane also showed a smile and replied, \"Well, then we might as well try!\"</p><br/><p>After searching for a while, Rody suddenly cried out in surprise, \"There are some texts here!\"</p><br/><p>Sure enough, there was a line of strange broken texts engraved at the top of the square-ish frame of the stone gate.</p><br/><p>Diane looked at it for a moment and frowned, \"This is strange. This is not the written language of the Kara clan. It looks more like the written language of the Empire. However, there are also a lot of differences.\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked at it with rapt attention and suddenly laughed, \"This is the language of the Empire\u2026However, this is the ancient language of the Empire. After hundreds of years of evolution, the written language we use now is naturally different from ancient times.\"</p><br/><p>Diane laughed and asked, \"Can you understand it?\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded. He casually replied as he read the text with rapt attention, \"I once studied the ancient language in the Imperial Academy. However, I did not learn it very well and can only understand a little.\"</p><br/><p>He looked at the text for a moment. He then closed his eyes and mumbled out a series of strange words. His voice became softer and softer. He then saw the glossy mirror-like stone gate suddenly shake. Ripples appeared on the glossy surface of the mirror-like gate as if it was the surface of the water. He then heard a series of rumbling sounds of gears turning. After the roar, a large rock pushed out slowly from the wall about five meters from the left of the stone gate.</p><br/><p>Then the large rock rolled over. A deep stone trough was revealed in it while a small funnel-shaped hole was seen in the trough.</p><br/><p>\"What is this?\"</p><br/><p>The two of them walked over and found a line of text engraved on the rock. The text was also in the ancient language.</p><br/><p>Rody took a deep breath and slowly read out. \"The blood of the sinners would be sacrificed to the Almighty God!\" Rody frowned and asked, \"What does this mean?\"</p><br/><p>Diane suddenly trembled and smiled bitterly, \"Blood of the sinners. Don\u2019t you understand the meaning of the word 'sinners'? In the eyes of the Protoss, people in our Kara tribe are all sinners!\" She then smiled sadly and said, \"In other words, to open this gate, this stone trough must be filled with the blood of a Kara tribesman!\"</p><br/><p>Rody froze for a moment. He suddenly grabbed Diane\u2019s hand and shouted, \"Don\u2019t even think about it! Don\u2019t even think of \u2026 Damn! This trough is so large. Do you know how much blood is needed to fill it up?\"</p><br/><p>Diane reluctantly smiled, \"Other than me, do you see anybody else here from Kara tribe?\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and shouted, \"Nonsense! Don\u2019t even think about it! You would die before you could even fill up that big trough!\"</p><br/><p>Diane trembled. Her eyes revealed a strange glint. \"Do you care about me?\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded his head and pulled Diane to his side. He then said, \"No matter what, I will not let you do anything stupid!\"</p><br/><p>Diane sighed and the two of them returned to the front of the stone gate. They then looked at their reflections on the glossy mirror-like stone gate.</p><br/><p>Diane stood in front of Rody and leaned back on Rody\u2019s arms. She gazed into the mirror and suddenly chuckled. \"Rody, have you heard of a story?\"</p><br/><p>\"What story?\"</p><br/><p>Diane smiled gently. She looked at Rody's reflection in the mirror and murmured, \"Mirror, mirror, please tell me, who is the most beautiful woman in this world?\"</p><br/><p>She had an infatuated expression and an intoxicated smiled as she tenderly looked at Rody\u2019s reflection in the mirror.</p><br/><p>Rody trembled. He could not help but laugh, and replied, \"Do you need to ask? Just look at the woman in the mirror and you will know the answer.\"</p><br/><p>Diane smiled gently in the mirror. Although her hair was ruffled and her face was covered with a bit of dust, her beauty shone through. The eyes that looked at Rody was filled with infinite tenderness.</p><br/><p>Rody reluctantly smiled and asked, \"You have also heard of that story?\"</p><br/><p>Diane shook her head. She secretly put her hands into her bosom and then pushed something into her hands. Suddenly, she faintly sighed and her eyes gradually turned moist as she murmured again, \"Mirror, mirror, please tell me, who is the person I love the most in this world?\"</p><br/><p>With a sigh, when that phrase \"who is the person I love the most in this world\" entered Rody\u2019s ears, Rody felt his heart severely twist.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Diane, who was standing in front of him, disappeared.</p><br/><p>Only Rody's reflection was left in the mirror.</p><br/><p>Rody was stunned. Suddenly, he realized what happened and he roared loudly, \"Diane!\"</p><br/><p>Rody immediately rushed towards the stone trough, but an invisible wall stopped him about two meters away from the trough.</p><br/><p>Fresh blood could be seen flowing down from above the stone trough. The fresh blood flowed down into the funnel.</p><br/><p>\"Stop! You stop right now!\" Rody roared and suddenly punched the invisible wall.</p><br/><p>After a loud bang, there was a painful cry. Diane\u2019s figure reappeared next to the stone trough. She then opened her mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\"Rody, don\u2019t punch anymore. This boundary is connected to my body! If you break this boundary, I will die first!\" Her face turned pale and she still had blood in her mouth. She smiled at Rody and said, \"No matter what, this gate is your only way out\u2026You must definitely leave this place!\"</p><br/><p>Both of Diane\u2019s hands were placed above the stone trough. Her wrists had been bitten and fresh blood was gurgling into the stone trough.</p><br/><p>Rody was terror-stricken. In desperation, he could not help but raise his fist to punch the wall again. However, he pulled back his hand when he remembered Diane\u2019s words. He shouted, \"You must not do this! You must quickly stop!\"</p><br/><p>Diane ignored him. Rody shouted again, \"We can think of other ways! Other ways! You\u2026sh*t, you will die!\"</p><br/><p>Diane turned paler as blood continued to flow out of her body. Her forehead also started to sweat. Finally, she could no longer stand and she gradually sat down on the ground.</p><br/><p>Rody was sweating buckets as he shouted from beside her. Diane did not say anything. She quietly looked at Rody with a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>Finally, Rody suddenly shouted, \"Fine! If you want to die here, then we will die together!\"</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly jumped a few steps away and then black flames burst violently out from his body. At the same time, black masses of energies emerged from both his hands and his hair was pulled and tossed about up by layers of air waves. The blacks of his eyes turned darker and darker. After that, Rody suddenly roared loudly. The voice of his roar was inhuman. It was as if the Mystic Dragon had roared.</p><br/><p>Seeing the black colored air masses on both his hands becoming more and more powerful, Diane was alarmed and exclaimed, \"Are you crazy? Rody, you are going to make this whole place collapse!\"</p><br/><p>\"I do not care! Let it collapse! If you want to die, we will die together!\"</p><br/><p>Diane\u2019s body flashed fiercely. Suddenly, she turned weak and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately rushed forward. The invisible wall in front of him had already disappeared. Rody then carried Diane in his hands. He then tore off his clothes and used it to bandage the wounds on both her wrists. After that, Rody angrily scolded, \"You are a crazy woman! You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>When he saw Diane slowly opened her eyes to look at him, Rody could not say another word.</p><br/><p>Diane sighed and whispered, \"I just want to do something for you. I am willing to die for you!\" Tears flowed out of her eyes, and she looked somewhat distressed.</p><br/><p>Finally, Rody could no longer endure it. He bent down and lightly kissed her pale face. \"I do not want you to die! If you really want to do something for me, then you must keep on living!\"</p><br/><p>Rody gently held Diane and stood up. He placed one of his hands around her waist. With Diane in his arms, they once again stood in front of the stone gate.</p><br/><p>\"Sinners, sinners!\" Rody suddenly shouted, \"The world\u2019s most evil are these bastards who think of themselves as Gods! Sooner or later, I will kill all of them one by one!</p><br/><p>Diane smiled weakly. In his embrace, she felt silly when she saw Rody's upright and unafraid expression.</p><br/><p>Rody sneered and said, \"Killing Gods\u2026hmph. I have almost forgotten. Gods also can be killed! I think I coincidentally have something in my hands that reportedly can kill Gods!\"</p><br/><p>After putting down Diane, Rody closed his eyes and stretched out his left hand. In the midst of a mass of black energy, a small silver bow and arrow appeared in his hands.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

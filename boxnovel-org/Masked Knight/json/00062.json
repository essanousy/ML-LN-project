Her graceful back was facing Rody. Her beautiful hair was like satin and it hung loosely on her back. She was busy combing her hair with a white jade comb. Even then, her movements were so elegant it was like a dance.</p><br/><p>For a split second, Rody was astonished.</p><br/><p>A soft sigh was heard. Hearing the footsteps, Myka did not turn around and just spoke indifferently, \u201cYou\u2019re here again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s mouth dropped open. He then gave a wry smile and asked, \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Myka turned around. Her tender face still showed a faint indifference. She took a quick glance at Rody and smiled. Even though she smiled, the smile was cold and detached.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know, I have a special skill? I can remember a person\u2019s footsteps. After listening to a person\u2019s footsteps once, I will be able to recognize that person by his footsteps.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Myka resumed combing her hair. Rody stepped forward and tried to say something. However, he did not know what to say to this indifferent beauty. In fact, he did not even know why he decided to visit Myka at that moment.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because Myka was among the few people who knew that he was an impostor. A person would always subconsciously have an unknown but intimate relationship with someone who knew their biggest secret.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Myka soon finished combing her hair and she stood up gently. At this point, Rody realized that Myka was only wearing a thin plain silk robe. She also did not wear any make-up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I just got out of bed and haven\u2019t dressed myself up.\u201d Myka smiled as she showed a rare blush.</p><br/><p>With that shallow and simple smile, she no longer looked indifferent. It was as if spring had arrived to melt the snow and there was a sudden blooming of spring flowers. Rody\u2019s heart jumped. He then took a deep breath and tried to suppress the strange throbbing in his heart.</p><br/><p>However, that warm smile was fleeting. When that smile disappeared, Myka\u2019s face showed indifference again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSit down, Your Excellency.\u201d Her voice was soft but her tone was nonchalant and a little mocking. Rody gave a wry smile. He knew that she was laughing at the fact that he was actually an impostor. Thinking of this, Rody started to relax. In the Imperial Capital, Rody had to pretend to be someone else in front of everybody other than Nicole. However, the beauty in front of him knew that he was an impostor. As a result, Rody felt extremely relaxed because he did not need to keep pretending in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to leave the Imperial Capital tomorrow,\u201d Rody spoke as he slowly sat down and relaxed.</p><br/><p>Myka gave a shallow smile. She rested her chin on her hand and looked at Rody.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to war in the Northwest,\u201d Rody continued.</p><br/><p>Unbeknownst to him, Myka\u2019s hand which was supporting her chin trembled slightly. She gently asked, \u201cIs it going to be very dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody nodded his head and replied, \u201cYes, it is very dangerous. I am not afraid but I kind of feel a little preposterous right now. You\u2026 you should be able to understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Myka looked at Rody\u2019s eyes and suddenly showed an expression of gratitude, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rody froze for a moment before he realized that she was thanking him for replacing the real Seth. If it were not for him, the person going to the battlefield would be the real Seth. She was thanking him for going in place of Seth.</p><br/><p>Somehow, Rody started to feel angry. His voice also became somewhat hoarse. \u201cYou do not have to thank me for him! I\u2026 Even though I am an impostor, it is still my duty! I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Myka was gazing at Rody and saw his expression change. She suddenly smiled and interrupted him, \u201cNo, you misunderstood me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Rody stared blankly.</p><br/><p>Myka\u2019s smile was so sweet, it was as if flowers were blooming and her eyes became much more gentle. \u201cI thanked you because you are willing to tell me your thoughts. You are treating me as a trusted friend. I was not\u2026.\u201d Right at that moment, she pointed outside. Although the door was closed, the voices outside were still audible.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was not thanking them,\u201d Myka immediately became gloomy and grief showed in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know, you are the second man I have met who did not treat me as a plaything,\u201d Myka said. \u201cYesterday, Bayan came. However, he did not dare to treat me badly. He had already taken a fancy to me much earlier. Hmm\u2026\u201d Her tone sounded helpless and troubled. \u201cIn fact, the men who have met me, none of them were able to forget me. You guys are different. You guys are different from Bayan and the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c'You guys'\u2026 Do you mean me and Seth?\u201d Rody felt a sense of anguish. He himself did not understand why he had such peculiar thoughts. After all, including today, he had only met this woman twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Myka slowly stood back up. She turned and retrieved a small bottle from the cabinet then, she went back and sat down. After that, she gave the bottle to Rody.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my personal brew. It is not like the other wine. Usually, I never take it out for others to drink. Why don\u2019t you try it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody took the bottle. For a moment, he wanted to loudly ask, \u201cOnly Seth drank this before?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he decided not to ask and slowly removed the cap. He raised his head and drank a mouthful. When the wine entered his mouth, he felt an unusually strong and rich scent. It had a scent like flowers but it was not entirely the same. Along with the fragrance, it also gave a burning sensation. His tongue felt hot as if it was being burned. When he swallowed it, the burning sensation seemed to go down his throat and enter his stomach.</p><br/><p>Myka\u2019s voice gently sounded out, \u201cI am 18 years old now. When I came here, I was only 16 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Myka gave Rody a profound look and slowly said, \u201cThere are a lot of miserable things in this world. As there are a lot, it is not worth talking about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and stopped asking. He took the bottle and drank another mouthful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not know whether I am considered lucky or unlucky. The day after I arrived, I met Seth. At that time, I was afraid and also felt strange. He did not seem much older than me yet he still came to this kind of place.\u201d Myka smiled. After that, she shook her head and continued, \u201cFortunately, he was very powerful and took a fancy to me. That was why he spent a lot of money. Madam Sophie did not allow me to do any other thing. My daily task was to dress up and wait for him. As a result, I got to spend my time here well. Sometimes, Seth would come every day and sometimes he would not come for a few days. He taught me how to play the piano and he taught me how to sing. I would also learn how to dance from the teachers here in order to show him. I was so silly then. I thought that I could be happy in this life; I even forgot my identity. In the end\u2026 I am just a prostitute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Prostitute\u2019. The words that came out of Myka\u2019s mouth sounded cruel. Rody felt his hands tremble and the wine almost spilled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

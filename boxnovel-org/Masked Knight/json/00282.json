Rody had fully experienced how powerful that array was.</p><br/><p>\"Quickly stand behind me!\" Kara said and then used a high ranked Patron Saint Boundary.</p><br/><p>This was not out of kindness. But at that moment, he wanted Rody's help. At that moment, Rody was exhausted and in worse condition than Kara. Kara had no choice but to exert himself.</p><br/><p>\"You want to use this sorcery array to get rid of a snake head?\" Rody softly asked. \"Will it work? Just now nothing we tried work. Its head is surprisingly hard.\"</p><br/><p>\"Just wait and you will find out.\" Kara seemed very confident. \"The power of a God-ranked strangling array is not as simple as you think.\"</p><br/><p>\"But\u2026\" Rody frowned. \"Are you sure that the head that comes out is the weakest? What if it is the strongest head? Are you certain?\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\" Kara's reply almost made Rody angry. \"I am gambling!\"</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Rody's reply, Kara added, \"Do you have any other way besides this? If you really think having a domain power means you are invincible, feel free to go to the front and duel with the snake.\"</p><br/><p>Rody spat and no longer said anything. He stood behind Kara and looked at the struggling Hakone Serpent.</p><br/><p>The sacred mountain shook as boulders of various sizes started to roll down the mountain. The Hakone Serpent's head did not seem to be aware of the impending crisis. It roared at Rody and the others as if it wanted to blow out flames from its mouth.</p><br/><p>Then the sorcery array started to move.</p><br/><p>The snake head stuck at the entrance also seemed to finally become aware of its situation. It raised its head and roared desperately.</p><br/><p>However, midway in its roars, the sound was cut off.</p><br/><p>Rody could clearly see the originally broken sorcery array started to create cyclones again. At the beginning, the disc slowly turned but then, its speed suddenly accelerated. Over a dozen cyclones spun in different directions like a dozen sharp blades.</p><br/><p>Before the roars ended, there was a burst of blood.</p><br/><p>The lower part of the snake's head started to be \u2018spun' around.</p><br/><p>Flesh and blood splashed everywhere. The snake head could no longer make any sound. It struggled powerlessly as it tried to rush out, but then, feeling that it was impossible, it tried to retreat.</p><br/><p>However, the entrance was too narrow, causing the snake to be stuck there and unable to move.</p><br/><p>And so, flesh and blood continued to fly as the snake head was spun around quickly. As the blood flowed out, the snake spat out its last fiery breath before it crashed to the ground.</p><br/><p>Rody with domain powers and his Dragon Spell Scimitar could not injure the Hakone Serpent. However, the sorcery array had easily injured it.</p><br/><p>\"Is it done? Is it that simple?\" Nedis asked in alarm.</p><br/><p>\"No!\" Rody became vigilant. Although he saw the Hakone Serpent's head cut off, he could feel that the snake's aura had not weakened.</p><br/><p>Rody could feel the snake weaken when he accidentally got rid of that other head. That earlier situation was completely different.</p><br/><p>While the head was indeed cut off, the sorcery array seemed to have slowed down. It was obvious that cutting off the Hakone Serpent's head was more than what the array could handle.</p><br/><p>There was a spurting sound. Rody could clearly see the friction between the snake and the cyclone caused sparks to fly. The sorcery array's power then started to tremble.</p><br/><p>\"Looks like we have lost the gamble!\" Kara sighed. He then laughed bitterly and said, \"This head is not its weakness.\"</p><br/><p>\"What happens now that we have lost the gamble?\"</p><br/><p>\"Look\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The body that lost its head contracted and left its head on the floor. Then an even more powerful roar came from the cave.</p><br/><p>The snake head left in the sorcery array was grounded into powder.</p><br/><p>At that moment, something shocking happened.</p><br/><p>The four people felt a strong vibration under their feet which made them stand unsteadily.</p><br/><p>After that, there was a loud explosion as the sacred mountain burst open.</p><br/><p>The huge mountain wall had collapsed and revealed its hollow belly.</p><br/><p>Kara then said, \"The mountain has collapsed and the illusion is broken. Rody, the rest is up to you.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>There was a loud cry as the Hakone Serpent broke through the mountain wall and came out.</p><br/><p>One, two, three\u2026 seven!</p><br/><p>Rody then cried out in alarm. \"Why does it still have seven heads?\"</p><br/><p>Kara smiled bitterly and replied, \"It only has a weakness. If the one destroyed was not its weakness, the cut-off head would naturally be able to grow again.\"</p><br/><p>The sacred mountain already showed a huge crack and half of the Hakone Serpent's body was exposed. It seemed like it was still struggling.</p><br/><p>The sorcery array at the entrance to the cave had suddenly vanished and no longer existed when the mountain wall collapsed.</p><br/><p>\"The entrance is gone. The sorcery array would naturally disappear as well!\" Kara said, \"Now is the time! Rody, attack it before it comes out! Use that trick!\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you talking about\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! That one!\" Kara agitatedly said, \"It is that \u2018not people' trick!\"</p><br/><p>Kara then grabbed Sith and Nedis who were behind him and then jumped behind Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody took a deep breath. He then took out the sword from his waist and held it with two hands.</p><br/><p>A faint black flame slowly spread from his hands.</p><br/><p>The golden fighting energy from his body spread out gorgeously like fireworks. For some time, it looked as though the sun had fallen to the earth. Rody was burning proudly but then something changed.</p><br/><p>The golden flames around Rody suddenly became violent. The two-meter-high flames suddenly soared upward. It was like an extremely massive fireball in the night sky.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the clouds started rolling in the sky. After that, the huge golden fireball suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>At some point, the golden flame started to have traces of black. The black color gradually spread and turned the entire golden flame into black flames. The blackness was like a black hole in the starry skies as if it was hell's abyss.</p><br/><p>Finally, Rody's golden flames had turned completely black. He was wrapped in a gloomy vague black flame. However, it had a very powerful threatening aura.</p><br/><p>Rody closed his eyes and entered a strange state. His face showed an agonizing expression and his arms trembled.</p><br/><p>The air around him turned violent. However, it seemed to follow some kind of rule and only surged close to Rody.</p><br/><p>The struggling Hakone Serpent at the mountains seemingly felt its powerful enemy change. The snake had turned silent for a moment before all seven heads roared at the same time.</p><br/><p>The roar was filled with anger and a bit of fear.</p><br/><p>Rody slowly put his hands together forming a circle. His fingers had crossed each other as it pointed towards the snake. Black air mass slowly came out from his fingers. The black air expanded numerous times.</p><br/><p>The air started to howl like a beast. Kara's face seemed to remain the same but his eyes gave a weird expression. Nedis and Sith had turned pale and started to tremble.</p><br/><p>It was a living being's instinctual fear when a lower life form recognized a higher life form.</p><br/><p>Rody finally opened his eyes. His originally brown eyes had turned into evil black. After that, he opened his mouth and said a few strange words.</p><br/><p>\"@$!$#@\"</p><br/><p>The way the words were spoken was similar to a sorcerer's incantation. Nedis had started to chatter as she said, \"Rody\u2026what\u2026what did he say?\"</p><br/><p>Sith's expression warped a little as though he was cut by a sword. He could not control himself and replied, \"He\u2026he is speaking in the dragon language! It is the dragon language! It is those words!\"</p><br/><p>\"What is it?\" Nedis could barely stand anymore.</p><br/><p>\"It is the dragon language.\" Kara sighed. He pulled Nedis and Sith behind himself and showed a nostalgic expression as if he was remembering what happened thousands of years ago. He then said, \"He said, Mystic Dragon Purge.\"</p><br/><p>The black flames at Rody's fingertips grew more and more powerful. Finally, there was a sudden loud noise. A black fiery dragon flew out from his hands. The black dragon opened its mouth and roared violently as it charged towards the Hakone Serpent with the black flames around its body.</p><br/><p>As the black dragon roared and flew, it had carried the black flames that seemed to come from hell. It even caused the air to burn.</p><br/><p>The seven heads of the Hakone Serpent opened their mouths at the same time and issued its roar at the black dragon.</p><br/><p>\"Close your eyes!\" Kara shouted at Nedis and Sith. Nedis then felt a hand cover her eyes and could not see anything at all.</p><br/><p>Red lights\u2026black lights\u2026</p><br/><p>Although she could not see anything, the sounds she heard made Nedis' heart shake. The vibration caused by the dragon's roar and the snake's roar almost ripped the sky. They roared endlessly as if the sky was raining thunder.</p><br/><p>Nedis was extremely frightened.</p><br/><p>Rody's eyes were also closed and did not look in front. However, he could feel the Mystic Dragon controlling his fingertips. It roared as it fought against the Hakone Serpent.</p><br/><p>\"I will become stronger! Stronger! Stronger!\" An unfamiliar voice shouted loudly in his heart.</p><br/><p>Rody did not notice that the ring on his index finger, made from the Staff of Moses, was emitting a dazzling white light. But at that moment, he was covered in black flames. The white light looked kind of dim and was hardly noticeable.</p><br/><p>After that, there was a clear and melodious crack. The ring had a subtle crack.</p><br/><p>The wind whistled in the ears, lightning flashed. It was as if the rules in that entire space were in disarray.</p><br/><p>The last ray of light flashed and space started to calm down.</p><br/><p>Rody opened his eyes and suddenly felt weak. He could no longer stand and heavily sat on the ground. His vision turned black as though he had fainted.</p><br/><p>Nedis and Sith could finally open their eyes. With one look, the sky and the earth had changed.</p><br/><p>The sky seemed extremely bright. The biggest change was that all the clouds had scattered. At that moment, all the stars in the sky shined down unhindered by the clouds.</p><br/><p>However, under the charming stars was a view that could not be considered charming.</p><br/><p>The entire sacred mountain had collapsed. The surrounding trees had disappeared. After the Mystic Dragon's hellfire finished burning, everything had disappeared.</p><br/><p>On the black earth, visible to everyone\u2026the Hakone Serpent was right in front there!</p><br/><p>The collapsed mountain buried half of the large snake's body. At that moment, the aggressive monster was extremely weak.</p><br/><p>The Hakone Serpent was badly mangled. Its broken body was covered with scars. Its flesh and scales were flipped over, exposing what was under it.</p><br/><p>What was even worse was its head. It only had six heads left. One head was completely eliminated. The remaining six heads was also broken. One head only had half of the head remaining. There was even another terrifying head with a missing eye hanging down limply.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" The terrifying scene caused Nedis to cry out in alarm as she turned pale.</p><br/><p>Kara felt relieved but he could barely stand. Earlier, he had used all his strength to create a Patron Saint Boundary. He never had any real intentions to protect Nedis and Sith. It was just that the overwhelming power of that collision would cause Kara's human body to vanish had he not made a Patron Saint Boundary.</p><br/><p>Even then, he felt weak. He staggered and almost fell.</p><br/><p>\"It is still alive!\" Sith cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>The Hakone Serpent might have been beaten until it barely still had a body. However, its wounds were rapidly healing. Blood stopped flowing out and its condition improved.</p><br/><p>Kara supported himself on Nedis' shoulders and then said, \"It is useless! We have already cut off two of its heads. Even if it heals, it has lost a lot of strength. Unfortunately, we don't seem to have any way of killing it.\"</p><br/><p>Rody sat on the ground and breathed heavily. However, even though he breathed in more air, he could not feel his strength recovering. Instead, he felt sleepy. He then bit his lips and hissed, \"Old guy, what do we do now? Can you still fight?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure, I can!\" 1 Kara laughed bitterly. \"Wouldn't that be strange? Do you want me to grab a rock and pound its head?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis let go of Kara and pulled Rody over. Rody was sweating as he said, \"Let us go quickly. Looks like it is impossible to continue today. Even if we want to get rid of this guy, we need to recover first before coming again.\"</p><br/><p>Sith looked at the two guys with domain powers and said, \"Let me try!\"</p><br/><p>Kara laughed bitterly. He looked at Rody and then back at Sith. He then shook his head and said, \"It will be of no use! You have not reached the level of domains. With your strength, you would not be able to injure it even if you attacked it.\"</p><br/><p>Sith did not believe it. He stood in front and created a gentle light with his staff. After that, several balls of light shot ahead.</p><br/><p>The several heads of the Hakone Serpent saw the attack coming and actually gave a mocking look.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the balls of light were reflected by a layer of red light at the snake's body before the attack reached the snake.</p><br/><p>The reflected attack flew back towards Sith and almost hit him.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Sith had simply tested it and did not launch a powerful attack.</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly said, \"Old guy, right now, I don't even have a little bit of strength in my body\u2026 Do you have a way to let me immediately restore some of my strength? I do not need much. Just a little will do!\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean?\" Kara sighed and threw himself onto the floor.</p><br/><p>Rody powerlessly laughed. \"I have one more trick I have not used! But right now, I cannot even lift a finger. Don't you have any way of doing it?\"</p><br/><p>Kara laughed bitterly. \"I can't do anything. I can heal bodily injuries with sorcery, but I can't help you recover your strength.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, a rumbling sound came from the mountain. The Hakone Serpent shook its body and raised one of its head. It faced the few people below itself and roared.</p><br/><p>Rody turned pale. \"It recovered so quickly?\"</p><br/><p>Kara had also turned pale and loudly shouted, \"Run! Run quickly!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

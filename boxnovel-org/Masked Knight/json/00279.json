He breathed out and laughed bitterly, \"Is the Hakone Serpent really so powerful?\"</p><br/><p>\"I am sure you know about the Mystic Dragon\u2026\" Kara narrowed his eyes and looked at Rody. \"You don\u2019t have to deny it. I can feel the Mystic Dragon\u2019s aura in your body\u2026Hmph. There is nobody in this world that knows about the Mystic Dragon more than me! I have fought countless fierce battles against the Mystic Dragon. I am already familiar with his aura.\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed bitterly. \"Looks like I can\u2019t hide anything from you.\"</p><br/><p>\"I do not want to ask why you have the Mystic Dragon\u2019s aura in you\u2026Right now, I do not care about these.\" Kara smiled. \"Don't you want to know how powerful the Hakone Serpent is? Let me tell you. The Mystic Dragon was created by the Gods to deal with me! However, it was not easy to create such a creature. This despicable act was done twice! The first one was a failure. The second one was a success!</p><br/><p>\"The Gods were not satisfied with the failure. That failure was the Hakone Serpent!\"</p><br/><p>\"So it was a defective product\u2026\" Rody smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>\"It was.\" Kara nodded. \"However, this defective product is not something we could deal with right now. This guy was created in the same image as the Mystic Dragon. It has at least half of the Mystic Dragon\u2019s power! I could barely deal with the Mystic Dragon. I believe you also know how powerful the Mystic Dragon was.\"</p><br/><p>Rody then glanced at Kara and said, \"According to you, the Hakone Serpent is extremely powerful. The two of us cooperating may not even be able to defeat it. After all, the Hakone Serpent has half the power of the Mystic Dragon. Even the two of us with domain powers are not enough to win.\"</p><br/><p>Kara laughed. \"That is why the rest depends on you! I have secretly spied on you when you were in the capital.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Rody was surprised.</p><br/><p>\"I was the one who sent Arslan to contact you. However, I could not feel at ease with those Dragons. Besides that, you killed three Dragon Paladins. Because of such skills, others only consider it rumors. They claimed that it was the result of you, Mouse, and Augustine cooperating. But when I asked Augustine, he refused to say anything and would rather receive punishment. I then realized that something strange happened. Hmph. I naturally wanted to see the person who could kill three Dragon Paladins!\"</p><br/><p>Rody was startled. He then realized that Kara\u2019s strength might even be more powerful than his own.</p><br/><p>He seemed to have a stealth technique.</p><br/><p>Diane was particularly good at this. Others with similar skills were the Silvermoon Tribe. They were all the later generations of Kara\u2019s people. It would not be possible for the descendants to be better than the ancestors.</p><br/><p>\"What does the last part of the phrase have to do with me? Am I not a person?\" Rody angrily asked.</p><br/><p>Kara did not deny it and simply said, \"In a sense, you cannot be regarded as a human.</p><br/><p>\"From the point of view of others, a human that has mastered domain powers is still a human. Although they are amongst the strongest humans, they cannot jump out of that limit. Of course, the person I was a thousand years ago, as well as the guys up there now, are naturally not humans. It is only you\u2026Hahaha. Rody, let me ask you. Have you mastered the Mystic Dragon Purge to the extent that it can be released in the Complete State?</p><br/><p>His last words shocked Rody.</p><br/><p>After a lot of deliberation, he found that Kara\u2019s words were reasonable.</p><br/><p>After joining together with the Mystic Dragon, it was difficult to tell if he was still a human or a dragon.</p><br/><p>\"However, if it is only about races, what about the Magic Beasts and Mythical Beasts? Even vampires are not people! If you were to pull a horse in, they would not be people as well! Would the Hakone Serpent obediently take that thing out?\" Rody could not help grumbling.</p><br/><p>Kara looked over with a mocking gaze. \"I didn\u2019t expect you to become annoyed\u2026The meaning of \u2018cannot see people\u2019 is simply that only the three \u2018not people\u2019 could vanquish the guardian. The first would be the shameless bastard up there. Second would be the me one thousand years ago. The third one would be the Mystic Dragon!\" He seemingly shook his head and continued, \"This prohibition was set by that fellow in heaven. The moment he set it, it would be senseless for him to grab that thing. It would also be impossible for me because I have lost my powers. The Mystic Dragon had also been gotten rid of one thousand years ago. In other words, no matter how you look at it, there are no flaws. The vampires, Mythical Beasts, Magic Beasts and other creatures are simply low ranked creatures to the guys in heaven. They are not even considered people. They were not even considered during the time they made the prohibition.\"</p><br/><p>Rody thought for a moment and then said, \"After all that, you simply want me to help you go and fight that monster. But why should I promise to help you?\"</p><br/><p>He looked outside and said, \"I came here simply because I was curious. I wanted to see what kind of treasure could threaten the Temple. Now there is a powerful guardian. Why should I take such a big risk?\"</p><br/><p>Kara sighed helplessly. He then gave a wry smile and said, \"We are just cooperating. You want to obtain that thing that could threaten the Temple. I want to obtain my Divine Primordial Spirit. We both just take what we want. Besides that, I want to overturn the religion. Aren\u2019t you also opposing the Temple?\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and loudly said, \"These words are meaningless! Right now, I don\u2019t even know what is the thing that threatens the Temple. It does not matter much to me whether I obtain it or not. Hmph. To fight half a Mystic Dragon and grab the Divine Primordial Spirit. You are the Devil God. That is a powerful creature created by God. Go and fight it alone! I am just a normal person. Excuse me for not accompanying you.\"</p><br/><p>After Rody finished talking, he walked past Kara and went towards the exit.</p><br/><p>Kara desperately and loudly shouted, \"Wait!\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked back and coldly glanced at Kara. \"Is there something else?\"</p><br/><p>Kara seemed hesitant. He finally sighed and said, \"How about we make an exchange? You help me get rid of this snake, I will tell you something useful!\"</p><br/><p>Rody narrowed his eyes and said, \"What?\"</p><br/><p>Kara was becoming irritated. He was a Devil God from the ancient times. Although Rody was a person with a domain powers, he was only a normal human to a God. How could an average person talk to a God so arrogantly? If it was not because Rody was necessary to get rid of the Hakone Serpent, Kara would not be bothered to waste so much energy talking to him. He would simply cast a spell and kill Rody. He only looked for Rody\u2019s help as he still needed to restore his own power.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Kara suppressed the anger in his heart and said, \"Hey kid! I do not know what weird method you used to get the Mystic Dragon into your body, but do you think you can properly acquire the Mystic Dragon with your human body and strength? Hmph. The Mystic Dragon is the world\u2019s most powerful creature! Even though you can temporarily make use of it and raise your strength quickly, what do you think the Mystic Dragon is? The more powerful you become, the more powerful the Mystic Dragon would become! One day, once your strength has passed a certain limit, the Mystic Dragon will awaken and consume your consciousness! You would no longer be yourself. That would be more terrifying than just killing you!\"</p><br/><p>Rody remained silent for a while as he thought of something.</p><br/><p>A shadow had been lingering in his heart for the past few days. After being knocked down into the ocean by a Dragon Paladin and going into a coma, he had met the legendary Pontiff Moses in his mind.</p><br/><p>He understood that he was in a dangerous situation. Moses had turned the Staff of Moses into a ring that would hold back the Mystic Dragon. Although the problem was solved, the Staff of Moses was only a legendary artifact. Even though it was powerful, it was only an \u2018even more powerful\u2019 artifact.</p><br/><p>Could the Staff of Moses truly save him from his perilous situation?</p><br/><p>Moses said something about being \u2018spellbound\u2019. He also said something about can be seven or eight but not nine. This was clearly a warning. Rody could only afford to use the Dragon God Transformation seven or eight times. He would be finished by the ninth one.</p><br/><p>The preposterous thing was that every time the dragon transformed, it was not within his control.</p><br/><p>Every time he encountered a special situation, his body would make a breakthrough. After that, there would be a Dragon God Transformation.</p><br/><p>Only God knows when the next time he was going to have another Dragon God Transformation was. It could be next year. However, it could also be at the very next minute. If Rody did not know this, how could he have peace of mind in the future?</p><br/><p>\"You have a way?\" Rody stared at Kara and directly asked.</p><br/><p>Kara hesitantly frowned and replied, \"With my identity, I will not lie to you. So, I will also tell you frankly that I have no solutions.\"</p><br/><p>He then smiled wryly and said, \"I also cannot understand what method you used to combine with the Mystic Dragon!\" He saw Rody\u2019s eyes turned gloomy and disappointed. He then immediately said, \"However, I have an idea that may help you solve this problem.\"</p><br/><p>\"Say it!\" Rody stared at Kara and narrowed his eyes. \"What kind of idea do you have?\"</p><br/><p>\"Boy!\" Kara coldly replied. \"If you want to know, you must promise to help me! Otherwise, I would not have anything to do with your survival. Even if you become a Mystic Dragon, you would only be like an extra one of those shameless fellows in heaven. I am really not against this outcome.\"</p><br/><p>Rody paid no attention to it and said, \"If you do not tell me, how would I know whether you are lying to me or not?\"</p><br/><p>Kara turned pale but Rody could not see his expression under his mask. Rody could hear Kara angrily said, \"Ignorant boy! What is your identity? What is my identity? Do you think I am those fellows in heaven? Fine! I will tell you. I believe you are still in control of your body because the Mystic Dragon is still weak. You have already mastered domain powers. The Mystic Dragon would become more powerful in the future and you would not be able to hold him back forever. However, I have a way to make your personal strength stronger and finally\u2026\" He hatefully said, \"Finally surpass domains!\"</p><br/><p>\"Surpassing domains?\" Rody was finally moved. It was as if a new path had opened up to him. He could not help but be fascinated and murmured, \"There is a realm beyond domains?\"</p><br/><p>\"You see that Divine Primordial Spirit?\" Kara coldly pointed at the distant red sunlight. \"I can teach you how to cultivate a Divine Primordial Spirit! Whether you could succeed or not in the future depends on your fortune. However, if you could cultivate it, you could surpass domains and reach the ranks of Gods! Hmph. You would be at the same level as me and those fellows up there!\"</p><br/><p>\"Same\u2026same level as Gods\u2026\" Rody\u2019s expression became complicated. His eyes looked blank yet looked preoccupied.</p><br/><p>Kara calmed down and said, \"What is your reply? I am not deceiving you. I am not like those bastards that deceive people! I will tell you this first. I can teach you but first of all, I cannot guarantee whether you would be able to practice it. Do you think it is so easy to become a God from a person? Second, even if you can do it, I do not know whether it could really protect your consciousness! However, I believe that who controls your body at the end is entirely dependent on whether you or the Mystic Dragon is more powerful. Once you reach the ranks of Gods, you will have enough power to wrestle with the Mystic Dragon!\"</p><br/><p>Rody pondered for a moment. He finally raised his head and gave a firm expression. He gritted his teeth and said, \"Alright! I will promise to help you. But I have one more condition!\"</p><br/><p>Kara took a deep breath. \"Speak!\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked at Kara and said, \"If\u2026if you obtain your Divine Primordial Spirit, you would become a Devil God again. At that time, would you be a God or a Devil?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha\u2026\" Kara laughed wildly. \"What is a God? What is a Devil? Those fellows up there and I are the same! Gods and Devils are simply what we call each other!\"</p><br/><p>\"That is great!\" Rody suddenly showed a weird smile. \"Well. My other condition is\u2026once you obtain your identity as a Devil God, I need a little bit of your blood.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Kara was surprised. \"My blood?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Rody had a sad expression as he lightly said, \"This is because I have sworn to revive a friend.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

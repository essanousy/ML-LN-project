The side of the deck was completely broken, and the five-sail warship was ruthlessly stuck in the smaller half of the hull. The huge roar and the shaking of the hull earlier were evidently caused by that.</p><br/><p>Obviously, the dwarfs\u2019 warships were extremely strong, and ramming was one of their effective means of attack. At least, based on Rody\u2019s view, that huge impact had tilted the hull of the flagship. The sea water rushed in from the broken parts of the hull and numerous sailors howled miserably.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the soldiers on two ships nearby were still busy shooting at each other with bows and arrows.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a row of small tubes appeared from the bow of the five-sail warship.</p><br/><p>Rody felt startled when he recalled the King\u2019s explanation of the dwarfs\u2019 warships. Now he understood what that was.</p><br/><p>As soon as he thought of that, that row of tubes suddenly sprayed out some blackish liquid. The black liquid looked sticky and silky.</p><br/><p>Rody pulled Nedis and quickly retreated to the other side of the ship. Suddenly, fire arrows were shot out from the dwarfs\u2019 five-sail warships and they flew towards where the oil was sprayed. Rody heard a loud bang as a huge heat wave surged from behind him.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the front half of the hull was enveloped by a raging fire.</p><br/><p>Many of Sauron Kingdom\u2019s soldiers and sailors were screaming in the fire. Some of them were engulfed in the flames as they ran out from inside the ship struggling. However, most of them immediately jumped into the sea.</p><br/><p>Many of the sorcerers aboard the Sauron Kingdom\u2019s warships flew up into the sky. Numerous fireballs were shot back and forth. Obviously, those sorcerers were trying to resist. However, the dwarfs\u2019 navy fleet was too fast and had already rushed in and was among the Sauron Kingdom\u2019s fleet. The warships from both sides were scattered among each other. As a result, those sorcerers who flew up into the sky could not accurately aim at their targets. In addition to that, most of them were shot down one after another by the archers from the dwarfs. The sorcerers screamed miserably from the sky as they fell to the ground looking like hedgehogs.</p><br/><p>Rody could not care less about all these. Sauron Kingdom had lost the battle even before it began. The resistance then was merely last-ditch struggles.</p><br/><p>Rody could not bear looking at the sailors and the soldiers getting killed tragically by the arrows. He pushed Nedis into a corner and shouted, \"Stay here and do not move!\"</p><br/><p>His body suddenly burst out with a golden flame fighting energy. His whole body was like a huge comet as he shot over towards the five-sail warship that had hit the flagship of Sauron Kingdom.</p><br/><p>With the loud sound of an explosion, a large hole immediately appeared on the sturdy dwarf warship made of high-quality ironwood. Rody immediately shot towards the other side of the warship and pierced through it.</p><br/><p>Rody's body skyrocketed and suddenly landed on the bow of the other party's ship. There was a succession of loud cries by many of the dwarfs in the dark. However, Rody could not understand their language. He looked around in the dark and saw that the dwarf soldiers below were wearing very eccentric armors. Those armors completely covered their bodies. Many dwarfs picked up their bows and arrows and shot at Rody who was standing at the bow of the ship.</p><br/><p>Rody could not be bothered with the arrows. Suddenly, he punched the deck.</p><br/><p>There was an earthshaking sound and then a rumbling sound came from the hull of the ship. The deck of the ship began to crack under Rody\u2019s fist. A huge crack then opened up and immediately the entire bow of the ship broke off.</p><br/><p>The five-sail warship that had lost its balance quickly tilted up. Ignoring the various screams from those people, Rody quickly rushed back to be beside Nedis. He also ignored Nedis\u2019 surprised exclamation. Rody pulled Nedis and then quickly jumped up to the high observatory platform. That sailor actually did not die. He was squatting behind the fencing wall of the observatory deck, hiding himself from the flying arrows.</p><br/><p>Rody pulled him up and shouted, \"You, send a signal for me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wh\u2026What?\" The sailor was trembling in fear.</p><br/><p>\"Order all the ships to surrender immediately.\" Rody anxiously said.</p><br/><p>Even though Rody was powerful and had domain powers, it was impossible for him alone to defeat a powerful naval fleet of nearly two hundred warships.</p><br/><p>After all, a Domain Master was still human and not God.</p><br/><p>\"I said, send a signal! Give the order to surrender!\" Rody roared.</p><br/><p>Although the sailor was timid, he was still loyal to his duty and refused, \"No!\" He even regarded Rody as an enemy. The sailor\u2019s first reaction was to pull out a dagger and thrust it at Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody did not have time to waste with the sailor. He instantly knocked the sailor out and took out a few torches of different colors from his arms.</p><br/><p>He hastily looked at them. He knew that the green torch was used to declare surrender.</p><br/><p>Rody easily conjured up a sorcery flame and a huge green flame was lighted up at the observatory deck.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately threw the flaming torch onto the observatory platform and then jumped down together with Nedis.</p><br/><p>Only by surrendering would the pitiful fleet and soldiers of Sauron Kingdom avoid being slaughtered.</p><br/><p>That was a battle that could not be won. The opponent has brought in their most powerful navy while the Sauron Kingdom\u2019s fleet was only strong in appearance. Although the fleet had many ships, they were mostly empty. It was just a bunch of pitiful bait who got betrayed.</p><br/><p>If they continued to fight, only the bait would get slaughtered.</p><br/><p>The other Sauron Kingdom\u2019s warships were very surprised to see the green flame, the symbol of surrender, above their flagship. Rody was not sure whether it would succeed or not, but when he saw another Sauron Kingdom\u2019s warship also light up the green flame, he felt relieved.</p><br/><p>Rody felt unwilling as this was the first time he surrendered on the battlefield. Since it was the Sauron people who would just get slaughtered, perhaps it would be better to surrender and survive.</p><br/><p>Nedis was standing by Rody\u2019s side. The series of events earlier terrified her, and she gasped as she shrank back into Rody. She asked, \"Why did you surrender? Aren\u2019t you very powerful? Aren\u2019t you on Sauron Kingdom\u2019s side?\"</p><br/><p>Rody coldly looked at the woman in his arms and lightly said, \"I am not on their side! I am not anymore!\"</p><br/><p>On the noisy deck of the ship, a captain roared. \"Who lit the torch? Who is it?\"</p><br/><p>Many people had already rushed towards Rody. Rody kicked the angry captain in front of him. He then grabbed the commander of the ship and coldly said, \"I am the one who gave the order! If you don't want to die, go and ask your King!\"</p><br/><p>He threw that pitiful commander aside and took Nedis to the side of the ship. At that time, Sith, disguised as the King, ran out from the cabin. At his side was a group of Royal Knights. Sith saw Rody with a single glance and immediately shouted, \"Rody, what are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>Rody pointed at him and shouted, \"If you do not want to watch these loyal soldiers get slaughtered, immediately order them to give up! They do not deserve this!\"</p><br/><p>Sith was anxious. He seemed like he wanted to push away those Royal Knights in front of him who regarded and protected him as the King and moved towards Rody. He shouted, \"Rody, you\u2026I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't blabber...I am not with you!\" Rody said with a faint smile. He simply ignored Sith and then said to Nedis, who was in his arms. \"Are you ready?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ready for what?\" Nedis suddenly had an uneasy feeling.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, it is jumping into the sea!\" Rody had a mocking look.</p><br/><p>Nedis screamed as she felt a huge force pulling her. Both of them had already jumped off the edge of the deck. With a splash, the two of them had fallen deep into the abyss of the sea.</p><br/><p>Sith immediately rushed to the edge of the deck. He saw Rody jump off the ship. He was extremely furious, but he could not do anything.</p><br/><p>Although it was not the cold season, to jump into the sea in the middle of the night completely submerged and surrounded by the cold seawater instantly made all the sounds of the explosions, cries and screaming from the battle disappeared. The piercing cold water made Nedis very frightened.</p><br/><p>In the midst of it, she swallowed a few mouthfuls of the salty and astringent seawater. She instantly coughed out violently and her body involuntarily struggled fiercely.</p><br/><p>However, Rody continued to pull her deeper into the sea.</p><br/><p>When the two of them had sunken to almost the bottom of the sea, suddenly a streak of milky white light appeared at Rody\u2019s index finger. That light grew bigger and bigger and finally, it completely wrapped Rody and Nedis inside.</p><br/><p>The even more strange thing was that the light actually forced away the water, bit by bit. Immediately, a few cubic meters of a waterless space was formed around the two of them!</p><br/><p>Nedis coughed violently in Rody\u2019s arms. She coughed out big mouthfuls of the seawater, and felt weak as well. When her breathing finally calmed down, she immediately roared at Rody. \"Are you trying to kill me?\"</p><br/><p>Rody smiled calmly and used his eyes to signal her to look around.</p><br/><p>The anger in Nedis\u2019 face immediately disappeared. She was surprised as she looked at the waterless space surrounding them. She exclaimed, \"This is\u2026You...how did you do this?\"</p><br/><p>\"It is sorcery.\" Rody simply answered.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Rody could not tell Nedis directly that the old man, Moses, had transformed the legendary Staff of Moses into the ring on his finger.</p><br/><p>The Staff of Moses could even split the entire sea; therefore, it was naturally very easy to create a waterless space in the sea.</p><br/><p>Nedis looked surprised and curious as she and Rody stood at the bottom of the sea with the rocks and the aquatic plants. They were surrounded by the underwater world, but it looked as if the water was blocked by something and could not flow in. Nedis curiously stretched out one of her fingers to touch the edge of the waterless space. Her finger easily entered the sea.</p><br/><p>It was wet and cold.</p><br/><p>Nedis suddenly trembled and forcefully held Rody. \"Very cold!\"</p><br/><p>Her clothes had been soaked wet the moment she fell into the sea. She was actually still bathing when she was interrupted by Rody and she had hastily put on the military uniform. Besides that, she had only taken the shirt.</p><br/><p>Although the loose uniform was large enough to cover her from above her knees, she was naked below that. Even though Nedis liked to seduce people, she felt tense when she actually stood in front of others, especially Rody. That was especially so since her clothes were wet and had tightly stuck to her body, completely showing off the curves of her body...</p><br/><p>Her spotless white legs were exposed. As Rody seemed to be looking at her, Nedis screamed, \"What are you looking at?\"</p><br/><p>Rody lightly replied, \"Nothing.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis was angry until her face was flushed. \"You\u2026this is all your fault! I was still bathing, but you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody coldly replied, \"What do you mean, my fault? I was saving you! If I had not pulled you out, you would have been shot dead!\" Rody suddenly laughed. Watching the charming woman get angry vented his frustration at being pestered by her in the past few days. Feeling somewhat happy, Rody smiled and asked, \"Are you cold?\"</p><br/><p>He then burst into flames with his fighting energy. The warm fighting energy wrapped around the two of them. With Rody\u2019s powerful fighting energy, their drenched clothes quickly dried up.</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and retrieved his fighting energy. He then pulled Nedis and walked forward.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! You used fighting energy earlier, didn\u2019t you? Why did you stop using it?\" Nedis seemed dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>Rody frowned and stared at the pestering woman. \"Aren\u2019t your clothes dry already?\"</p><br/><p>\"But\u2026\" Nedis thought for a moment and then confidently said, \"But your fighting energy kept me very warm! Right now, I am wearing very little and it is very cold in the sea!\"</p><br/><p>As Rody listened to these words, he swore to Gods that his first thought was to strangle this woman, in front of him.</p><br/><p>Nedis actually wanted to use the golden fighting energy from a Domain Master which terrified Rody's powerful enemies to keep herself warm!</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s go!\" Rody pulled Nedis moved forward again.</p><br/><p>\"Where are we going?\" Nedis frowned. It was dark at the bottom of the sea.</p><br/><p>\"We are going to the dwarfs\u2019 island country.\" Rody seemed to smile. \"First, we will find some clothes for you to wear. Are we going to return to the Roland Continent, like this? Although I can fly, I cannot fly for a few days across the straits. If you want to go back using the bottom of the sea, at least, we will need to get clothes and food...\" He seemed to be mocking at Nedis. \"Otherwise, we will be starved to death before we reach it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, looks like you are not always cold. You actually know how to joke a little!\" Nedis then hatefully said, \"Based on what you said, we should to find a way to get a ship. I do not want to go back by walking under the sea!\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides that\u2026\" Nedis had not finished talking. \"Right now, I am wearing very little. You better not have any vile thoughts!\"</p><br/><p>As soon as Nedis finished, she put on a very frightened expression.</p><br/><p>Rody was angry. He turned pale and diligently pulled Nedis forward. He was afraid that he might throw that woman out in his anger.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

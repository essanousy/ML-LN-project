(1)</p><br/><p>Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation</p><br/><p>Kara was so angry that his lungs almost exploded.</p><br/><p>The True God Kara, the Devil God, had never met such an irrepressible and heretical bastard like this Fatty.</p><br/><p>When Kara heard Sky said that it was already respectful of him to the elderly by not slashing Kara, a newfound hatred was born. Kara suddenly roared loudly and threw himself towards Fatty.</p><br/><p>It was unfortunate for Kara. If it was a thousand years ago when Kara still had the strength of a Devil God, it would be easy to get rid of the hateful Fatty. Even then, after reincarnating, he had reached the rank of domain powers and could match Sky in strength.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, the ancient Devil God had been fighting all night and was covered with injuries. He was also exhausted and was fighting irrationally. How could he defeat Sky?</p><br/><p>Sky casually raised his hands to block and also attacked Kara causing him to fly out. Blood could be seen flowing out of Kara's mouth. Kara's face had a ruthless expression as he asked, \"Are you scheming against me for that boy? You want to snatch away my Divine Primordial Spirit?\"</p><br/><p>Sky laughed and did not immediately give a reply. He gave a backhand slash at the Hakone Serpent with several light blades. He then rushed up quickly and flew several laps around the Hakone Serpent. He looked as though he was sending out an endless wave of attacks.</p><br/><p>As Sky fought, he shouted in the direction of the red Divine Primordial Spirit, \"Rody, I am helping you stall this large snake out here. Hurry up!\"</p><br/><p>The Hakone Serpent was helpless against this opponent as its four heads spewed out fire wildly. However, Sky had the advantage in speed. On top of that, Sky was experienced in fighting huge monsters and could deal with it easily</p><br/><p>Kara had quieted down as he stayed far behind. Although he simply remained there, his body was trembling. His eyes were cold and sharp and he gritted his teeth so hard that blood appeared on his lips.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you antagonizing me?\" Kara suddenly asked from the back. \"For what purpose do you oppose me? If you want the boy to achieve God ranked status by obtaining my Divine Primordial Spirit, it is impossible!\"</p><br/><p>Sky fought the Hakone Serpent for a while and became somewhat tired. He flew around one lap and then back to Kara. Staring at Kara he said, \"I will do whatever I want! If you are unhappy about it, you just need to look for me!\"</p><br/><p>Kara gritted his teeth and said, \"What you just did is harming others without benefiting yourself! What is the use of you throwing that Rody into my Divine Primordial Spirit? Hmph. Do you think it is so easy to fuse with my Divine Primordial Spirit?\"</p><br/><p>Sky laughed loudly and said, \"Of course I know that! However, giving the boy the Divine Primordial Spirit is better than giving it to a Devil God like you! If anything, you should just blame the fact that you met me!\"</p><br/><p>Kara's murderous intent in his eyes grew stronger. He then said, \"My Divine Primordial Spirit cannot be fused together with others. Only I can control it! You are only causing harm to that boy! Fatty, it is not too late! Pull that boy back out\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Why is there so much nonsense? I will do what I want! If you want to pull that boy out, do it yourself!\" Sky ruthlessly swung his sword and fiercely said, \"If you speak more nonsense and provoke me, I will cut you into two!\"</p><br/><p>At this time, the Hakone Serpent suddenly roared and then its middle head swallowed the Divine Primordial Spirit.</p><br/><p>Before Sky could say anything, Nedis had already turned white. She had seen Rody enter the red sun-like thing and now that thing was swallowed by the snake. Nedis felt her mind go blank. She suddenly screamed out, \"Fatty! What are you doing!\"</p><br/><p>Nedis suddenly rushed towards Fatty. Long sharp nails suddenly emerged from her fingers as she attacked Sky with them like daggers.</p><br/><p>\"Aha!\" Sky jokingly taunted as he dodged. \"I did not expect you to be a vampire. Little bat\u2026\" Sky laughed at Nedis. \"\u2026why are you so angry?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis almost cried as she shouted, \"You\u2026you made him get swallowed...\"</p><br/><p>Sky easily held Nedis' wrist, laughed and said, \"Don't be so anxious. That boy will not die. I am very well aware of the situation.\"</p><br/><p>Sky then turned his head around and laughed, \"Didn't you say that the Divine Primordial Spirit cannot fuse with others? Let me tell you. From the start, I have not placed any hopes in him fusing with your Divine Primordial Spirit! However, I have heard of a saying\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Kara suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>Sky smiled proudly and said, \"This guy could even convert the Mystic Dragon. Do you think your Divine Primordial Spirit would be difficult to convert?\"</p><br/><p>Kara could not laugh anymore.</p><br/><p>According to common sense, the Divine Primordial Spirit could only be controlled by its original practitioner. After thousands of years of grinding while it was guarded by the Hakone Serpent, how much of Kara's consciousness still remained in the Divine Primordial Spirit was questionable. But the moment the Divine Primordial Spirit was created, it was impossible to be destroyed. If Kara wanted to take revenge against the Gods, he needed to recover his strength as a Devil God so that he could fight them. There were only two methods.</p><br/><p>The first method would be to cultivate from the start. He would need to cultivate from a normal person to a person with strong domain powers. From there, he needed to surpass domains and human boundaries to reach the level of a God. However, Prometheus' body needed decades to master domain powers. The body would have expired before he could reach God-ranked status.</p><br/><p>The other method would be to find his Divine Primordial Spirit from a thousand years ago. If he could obtain his Divine Primordial Spirit, he would be able to control what he cultivated last time. He would regain his level as a God-ranked person.</p><br/><p>The so-called Divine Primordial Spirit was not an energy. It was simply one of the methods the God-ranked people control their God-ranked strength. It was like a key.</p><br/><p>For an average person, obtaining the Divine Primordial Spirit would be useless. This was because they would not know how to use the power even if they get it. It was like having a pair of legs but no body.</p><br/><p>However, Fatty's words reminded Kara that the Mystic Dragon was in Rody's body.</p><br/><p>Nedis' eyes were filled with tear stains. Sky held her shoulder and did not allow her to continue struggling. At this moment, the Hakone Serpent that had swallowed the Divine Primordial Spirit gave a strange roar.</p><br/><p>That roar did not seem to come from anger or pain but\u2026</p><br/><p>Years later, Sky, who would recall that day, would comment that \u2018the ugly monster's roar sounded like it had a stomachache'.</p><br/><p>Without any external cause, the snake suddenly and violently tossed around as it roared painfully. Its body suddenly turned stiff in midair and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Everybody, including Kara, immediately ran away when the monster fell as none of them wanted to be crushed by the snake.</p><br/><p>Sky finally displayed some compassion. Instead of getting rid of Kara, he pulled Kara's hair and dragged him out of the way.</p><br/><p>When the Hakone Serpent crashed, there were several cracks in the ground. It suddenly twisted its body. The others that escaped to a distance then saw a shockingly extraordinary scene.</p><br/><p>One of the Hakone Serpent's heads expanded as if someone continued to inflate its body. The snake's body continued to expand as it roared tragically. It thrashed its body around as its tail continued to sweep the ground.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, numerous cracks appeared on the inflated body. A slight burst of golden light shined through in the cracks between the scales.</p><br/><p>The snake gave a blood-curdling scream before it exploded with a loud sound. As fragments of its body scattered, a half red and half gold ball of light flew out of the body.</p><br/><p>As the ball of light left the body, the snake roared loudly, fell to the ground and then stopped moving. One of its heads exploded and its size shrank again.</p><br/><p>The three-headed Hakone Serpent was now only one-third its original size. It seemed to have no more strength and lay down on the ground powerlessly. The three heads looked at the scene in the sky as it gasped for breath. Its white colored breath could be seen as it breathed heavily.</p><br/><p>The half-red half-gold ball of light flew high into the clouds. A loud and long cry then came from within the ball of light.</p><br/><p>The voice in the cry was filled with shocking and explosive power. The vibration of the voice caused the clouds to disperse.</p><br/><p>The ball of light then burst into numerous fire that was like a meteor shower falling all around. As the light dimmed, Rody's figure could be seen floating in midair.</p><br/><p>Nedis was pleasantly surprised and shouted. She was about to rush on ahead when Sky suddenly pulled and stopped her. He then said, \"Something is not right\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The aura around Rody's body seemed strange. He had appeared after the ball of light burst open. However, it was as though his body had no aura. He calmly floated in the air with his head hung down. It was as though it was very quiet.</p><br/><p>Only Sky could hear that Rody was mumbling a meaningless whimper.</p><br/><p>Kara also seemed to be able to hear Rody's voice and turned pale. \"He\u2026he could really absorb my Divine Primordial Spirit? That is impossible!\"</p><br/><p>Looking from afar, Rody's body suddenly moved.</p><br/><p>His body stood straight and he looked at the sky. After that, there was a change.</p><br/><p>An extremely violent aura suddenly spread out from Rody's body. It manifested in countless chaotic flows welling up around him. A dark oppressive aura spread out, seemingly able to cover up the entire sky. Rody's hair fluttered like countless snakes.</p><br/><p>Even more surprising was that his hair was growing quickly.</p><br/><p>As if it had a life of its own, the hair grew until it reached his heels. Rody then roared.</p><br/><p>His roar was even more violent compared to the Hakone Serpent. The waves caused by his voice blew the few people away. If Sky had not shielded the others, the waves would have caused them to fall apart.</p><br/><p>Rody's roar became more powerful as time passed. His roar was like the tides that came again and again. Even the Hakone Serpent that was on the ground trembled when it heard this roar.</p><br/><p>Sky opened up an aura field to protect his companions. He looked at the distant Rody in surprise and murmured. \"That\u2026that voice\u2026could it be\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>\"It is the dragon language!\" Kara's gloomily said beside Sky.</p><br/><p>\"Oh?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\" Kara was angry. \"You idiot! I have already told you that the Divine Primordial Spirit cannot be absorbed by others! I already told you that the Divine Primordial Spirit is not energy. Do you think it was an energy crystal? Did you think absorbing it would make a person more powerful and reach God-ranked level? You fool! That would not happen!\"</p><br/><p>Kara hatefully looked at Sky and slowly said, \"Let me tell you. The Divine Primordial Spirit is just a key! Obtaining it allows people to use God-ranked strength. It is useless for ordinary people to obtain it! That is because ordinary people do not cultivate to obtain the God-ranked strength! However, Rody is different. If he were to obtain the Divine Primordial Spirit, it would be more difficult to deal with than the Hakone Serpent! This is because the God-ranked Mystic Dragon is in his body!\"</p><br/><p>At a distance, Rody's long blue hair fluttered like the lake water. His body then went through a tremendous change.</p><br/><p>Black and dark aura balls appeared from his body. It slowly spread out and surrounded him. After being surrounded by the darkness, Rody's agonizing roar became more intense. Suddenly, he stretched out the fingers of his hands and white light poured out. The white light was extremely dazzling.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the black aura balls around Rody split into two. The left half of his body shined with a white light. The right side of his body shined with a black light. Both lights seemed to compete and consume each other while fiercely entangled with each other. Rody's eyes were closed. His expression became more and more distorted as he continued to roar. His voice filled the world. Even those in Sky's protective domain could feel the voice of the roar striking against their souls.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the darkness at his body grew more and more intense as it suppressed the white light. Rody's body shrank into a ball as if he was trembling. Suddenly, he choked as though he was struggling.</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly raised his hand and hammered his chest.</p><br/><p>He slowly spat out a mouthful of blood. After that, he spat out something from his mouth.</p><br/><p>That thing that came out was the red colored sun that had shrunk in size. Strange rays of light radiated from it.</p><br/><p>\"The Divine Primordial Spirit!\" Sky was surprised. \"Shit. Just now he was swallowed by the Divine Primordial Spirit. How did it become him swallowing the Divine Primordial Spirit?\"</p><br/><p>Kara's expression also changed as he shouted, \"My Divine Primordial Spirit!\"</p><br/><p>Kara rushed out extremely quickly. Sky also did not stop him.</p><br/><p>Rody's body suddenly stretched out after he spat out the Divine Primordial Spirit. The Divine Primordial Spirit slowly ascended like the rising sun.</p><br/><p>Kara anxiously wanted to reclaim his Divine Primordial Spirit. He had regained a little bit of energy after resting a little earlier. He used up this energy without any reservations as he charged towards the sky.</p><br/><p>At this time, Rody suddenly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>His brown eyes had turned black. The pupils in his eyes seemed to glow with an evil black light. His eyes seemed to lack human emotions and seemed to be without consciousness.</p><br/><p>He coldly looked at Kara who was flying above him and suddenly gave a sharp roar.</p><br/><p>He suddenly raised his hand and a black ball of light was condensed in his palm.</p><br/><p>There was a loud thunderous sound as a black fiery dragon came out from Rody's palm and ruthlessly flew towards Kara who was flying in the sky.</p><br/><p>It was the Mystic Dragon Purge.</p><br/><p>Half the sky seemed to be burnt by the black flames. From the point of view of Sky and the others, Kara was hit by the black fiery dragon and immediately burst into black flames. There was a violent blast and Kara's body was immediately covered with black flames. There was not a single sound. It was like the fiery tail of a meteor, disappearing into the clouds without a trace.</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly burst into laughter 1 . The laughter sounded evil. He then lowered his head and looked at Sky and the others. However, he did not continue looking at them as he found a more distinct target.</p><br/><p>The large monster, the Hakone Serpent that was quietly lying down on its stomach.</p><br/><p>Obvious to Rody, this target would arouse his interest more. He then roared. The black flames around his body burned even more. As he roared, a black flame shot down towards the Hakone Serpent.</p><br/><p>Sky could only taste bitterness in his mouth as he was unable to stop himself from saying, \"This is bad\u2026I seem to have brought a disaster\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Nedis was seemingly muddleheaded.</p><br/><p>Sky sighed and pointed at the distant Rody. He then softly said, \"That is the Mystic Dragon! I have fought it for hundreds of years. I recognize this aura! I can't be mistaken!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

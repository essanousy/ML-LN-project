The scene in front of him totally changed. Glenn's grey robe, which was supposed to shield him, had instantly turned transparent!</p><br/><p>Beneath the robe, the clothes also became transparent layer by layer! With one glance, Rody could see the elderly Glenn's skinny body. \"My God! Is that a human's body? This is just a set of skeletons! Then there is the body hair... and...\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head hard. This was because he clearly saw the serious-looking elderly Glenn wearing bright red underwear!</p><br/><p>The moment he saw that he looked away and dared not glance at Glenn anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Once again, he has the power to see through things. Damn it!\"</p><br/><p>The last time he had this power, he watched Miss Nicole change her clothes... but this time... this power made Rody feel like screaming.</p><br/><p>The body of a charmingly fair maiden when compared to the skinny body of a ninety year old man... the difference in feeling was too great!</p><br/><p>\"Oh my God! This is a nightmare!\", Rody was afraid that he would be traumatized in the future.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the ability to see through objects only lasted for a few moments, before that power disappeared.</p><br/><p>However, this does not prevent Rody from going crazy.</p><br/><p>\"Andy, you detestable fellow! What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, this guy is quite clever. He is actually carrying two treasured objects. Hmm, those magic crystals are really good things. Unfortunately, it only enhances a magician's power by thirty percent at most.\"</p><br/><p>Rody gave a wry smile. As he did not dare to close his eyes in front of elderly Glenn, he could only try and look elsewhere.</p><br/><p>\"Idiot. I was actually helping you. That guy was using a probing spell to look at you. If not because I helped to block you, your long ears would have already been discovered!\" Andy said in disdain.</p><br/><p>\"However, it was not necessary to let me see through his clothes.\"</p><br/><p>Glenn observed the Tulip family's descendant in front of him. Although he found that the boy's face was a bit strange, he had not discovered anything. He did not notice any fluctuation of power within the boy.</p><br/><p>\"Another useless waste .\" Glenn felt disappointed and offended. This Principal always put those aristocratic wastes with no potential in his class! It was simply a waste of his time!</p><br/><p>\"You! Go and sit at the back.\" Glenn's tone was cold. He then glanced at the Principal standing at the door. Its meaning was: You better leave!</p><br/><p>Rody did not dare to look at Glenn. He could only lower his head and walked towards the group of students. While keeping his head down, he simply found a place to sit. As he was sitting down, he heard a dissatisfied person utter a soft 'hmph'.</p><br/><p>Glenn no longer paid attention to the student who interrupted his lesson. He continued his lesson and answered the questions of those students sitting in front of him.</p><br/><p>Rody tried to diligently listen to the lecture but his foundation was too weak. He was someone who just entered in the middle of the lesson, so he could barely understand half of the contents. Rody looked left and right hoping to find something to help him. Suddenly, a slender hand came out from the side and placed a thick notebook in front of him.</p><br/><p>Rody looked towards the slender hand and found a friendly black haired girl smiling at him. She was a commoner, based on the uniform she was wearing.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you!\" Rody whispered.</p><br/><p>However, he heard a cold snort from behind</p><br/><p>Rody did not know for how long he had sat, but he could feel his buttocks turn numb. He immediately started to daydream, as he was never really interested in learning magic. On top of that, he knew that whether he participated or not, his upcoming assessment would not be affected. Nicole's reason for him to go to the academy was mainly to give him a conducive environment so that he could further adapt to his identity.</p><br/><p>He looked to the side and saw a few students in nobles' uniform having the same impatient expression. It would seem that they were all categorized together with him as 'ignorant and incompetent'. As for the ones who were listening attentively and deep in thought, they were commoner students.</p><br/><p>\"Really sad!\" Rody sighed.</p><br/><p>How come the nobles can get this valuable learning opportunity even though they are all talentless idiots, while the commoners have to wait for two years and then break their heads fighting for limited seats?</p><br/><p>Thinking like this, Rody sighed again.</p><br/><p>\"Tulip family's heir!\" Glenn suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"Was there something wrong with what I am saying? Why are you sighing?\"</p><br/><p>\".....\" Sensing a dozen pair of eyes staring at him, Rody's face turned red.</p><br/><p>Glen's facial expression was gloomy. He did not care what the Tulip family was like. In his presence, everyone must listen to him!</p><br/><p>\"You did not listen to me at all. Am I right?\" Glenn insisted.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Rody braced himself and replied.</p><br/><p>\"Then leave!\" Glenn answered seriously. \"Since you are not going to listen to the lecture even if you stay in here, you might as well leave! Get out from here!\"</p><br/><p>Glenn spoke coldly without giving any rooms for negotiations.</p><br/><p>Rody was sorrowful. He obligingly stood up and slowly left.</p><br/><p>How unlucky. Chased out by Master Glenn on his first day in class. Rody had no choice but to, step-by-step, descend the spiral staircase.</p><br/><p>\"Boy, turn left!\" Andy's voice sounded in his head.</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"I am telling you to turn left!\" Andy ordered again.</p><br/><p>Rody was feeling angry and then said loudly, \"Why should I listen to you?\" As he said that, he started to walk down the stairs faster.</p><br/><p>Unconcerned, Andy leisurely replied, \"In that case, what if I told you I will help you remove your long ears?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Rody stopped moving. \"Are you telling the truth?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nonsense! Go back to that place and turn left!\"</p><br/><p>This sentence was very effective. Rody obediently backtracked to the earlier location and turned left.</p><br/><p>In front of him was a wall.</p><br/><p>\"Isn't this just a wall?\" Rody asked.</p><br/><p>Andy also felt something was strange. He was agitated and started to speak incoherently. \"Why is it a wall? Was it sealed up? It is supposed to be a door... Boy, you have a sword, use it and cut through the wall.\"</p><br/><p>You must be kidding right? Cut through?! Do you think this was your own backyard? Do you know how big a havoc cutting down a wall will cause? Why don't you try it yourself?! The sword in my hands is just an ordinary sword! How can this thin long sword cut granite? Who do you think I am? The Sacred Swordsman?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He did not care about his manners or being graceful as long as he could sit comfortably. He held a golden cup of wine. It was a first-class wine presented by His Highness the Crown Prince.</p><br/><p>Old Mark lowered his head to look at the chessboard as he pondered. Just now Seth\u2019s move had immediately put Old Mark in a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>That chess was unique to the Roland Continent and was different from the popular chess game of the Radiant Empire. The rules on the movements of the pieces had some warlike implication. One was a well-learned playboy and the other was Dandong\u2019s disciple. They were naturally well matched.</p><br/><p>Mouse was standing at the side. She was not in the mood to watch the match between the two.</p><br/><p>In fact, Mouse felt resentful. Her resentment was mainly because she was unhappy with the playboy who had the 'couldn't care less' attitude.</p><br/><p>In order to protect the playboy, Mouse could not follow Rody out to the sea. Besides that, Seth had been very relaxed for the past few days at the Summer Palace. Every day, he played chess, read books, drank wine, admired the flowers and watched the moon. He was having an exceptionally satisfactory time, while Mouse had to stay at his side as his bodyguard.</p><br/><p>In fact, Rody had another reason for leaving Mouse behind. That playboy might run away at any time. If Mouse were to follow Rody out to the sea, perhaps by the time they returned, he would have disappeared!</p><br/><p>As it was difficult to meet Seth, Rody did not want to let him run away. He wanted to bring Seth back home to be dealt with by Nicole at all costs.</p><br/><p>Mouse could not help sighing when she saw Seth not concerned about his image as he raised his legs.</p><br/><p>In the past few days, the Consort had been coming quite often and Mouse could not endure her pestering. In order to keep up the deception, Seth simply had to continue his disguise as a woman. At that moment, Seth had the appearance of a well-bred noble lady. However, he carefreely spread out his legs and leaned back in the chair.</p><br/><p>Mouse could not help but coldly say, \"That\u2019s enough! Seth, sit properly!\"</p><br/><p>Seth gave her a supercilious look and asked, \"What\u2019s wrong? Are you starting to become impatient?\"</p><br/><p>Mouse remained silent, but her hands had already withdrawn back into the sleeve.</p><br/><p>Seth did not dare to make Mouse angry. With his good understanding of women, Seth knew that a woman would do anything once angered.</p><br/><p>He calmly sat up straight but deliberately sighed and said, \"Miss Mouse, to tell you the truth, I actually felt sorry...I know myself. In fact, when I was still at home, I would always drive those guards around me insane.\"</p><br/><p>After Seth spoke, Old Mark had already made his move on the chessboard. He looked up and said, \"Seth, concentrate on the game. If you were to anger the Black Veiled Saint, I will not protect you. We can eat after this game.\"</p><br/><p>Seth deliberately sighed as glanced at Mouse. He loudly said, \"Unfortunately, someone may not have the appetite to eat.\"</p><br/><p>Mouse narrowed her eyes and coldly asked, \"What did you say?\"</p><br/><p>Seth had probably felt Mouse\u2019s anger and the dangerous atmosphere. He immediately laughed and said, \"Nothing! I didn\u2019t say anything! I said Rody is very safe. With his strength, there are probably none on this continent who could threaten him. I believe all of us can eat and sleep in peace without thinking of anything. Perhaps he is currently eating a lavish meal. What is there to be worried about?\"</p><br/><p>Mouse finally could not take it anymore. She raised her hand and threw out a fireball. Fortunately, Old Mark was skillful. He hastily grabbed Seth\u2019s collar and pulled him to one side. There was an explosion as the chessboard and the two chairs were smashed into pieces by the fireball.</p><br/><p>Mouse\u2019s eyes flickered with anger. However, she suddenly had a thought. She forcefully suppressed her anger and coldly said, \"Well, now you should learn how to speak! Go and eat! After the meal\u2026I will do your make-up for you!\"</p><br/><p>Seth stared at the chessboard that was smashed to pieces. He suddenly smiled and said, \"Very good! Old Mark, let us eat! Today, I have an extremely good appetite and must eat more. Haha, the worse the appetite of others, the better my mood.\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark helplessly shook his head and sighed. \"Rody, I hope you can come back quickly. These two youngsters are driving me crazy!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>While the three of them were making a ruckus at the capital of Sauron Kingdom, Rody was sitting on the beach of the dwarfs\u2019 island eating grilled fish.</p><br/><p>He dug a hole at the sandy beach and lit a bonfire. He then made a frame with a few branches. Several fishes were caught from the sea and cleaned before sticking them on the branches. They were grilled by the bonfire under them and a fragrant aroma soon wafts through the air.</p><br/><p>The fishes were caught by Rody but Nedis was the one who cooked the meal. The thing that surprised Rody was that Nedis was very skilled at that despite her pampered look.</p><br/><p>Rody bit lightly on a fish that Nedis handed to him. He immediately thought that it was delicious and praised Nedis. She charmingly smiled at him and said, \"Do you think I am a woman who does not know how to do anything? I grew up alone and I must learn how to take care of myself.\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Nedis\u2019 words were simple but Rody faintly remembered in his heart that he himself became an orphan since his teens. He had also been taking care of himself before he met Nicole and Seth. Although Nedis' words sounded simple, she probably went through a lot of hardships in the process. This was something others could not understand. Besides that, her identity and Rody\u2019s identity were different. Although Rody lived a hard life, it was at the very least a safe life. On the other hand, Nedis seemed to have some enmity with the vampires. It was more difficult for her since she had to survive while avoiding her killers. Her simple words had unintentionally given Rody such impressions.</p><br/><p>It was already morning. The sea breeze was blowing gently. There was a faint light shining on the surface of the distant sea. As they were hungry, they no longer spoke and quickly ate their food.</p><br/><p>Rody had a big appetite. He looked as if he had not eaten enough even after he finished eating. Nedis looked at him and gave a slight smile. She then took out a raw fish from behind.</p><br/><p>Nedis had cleaned the fish earlier and had stealthily hidden it at some point in time. She then smiled and borrowed Rody\u2019s scimitar to cut the fish.</p><br/><p>The scimitar moved swiftly in Nedis\u2019 hands and over ten thin slices of fishes were cut. She then placed the fish slices on a kelp she found from the sea and gave it to Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody, who seemed curious, laughed. \"What? Can I eat this just as it is?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis smiled and replied, \"It is simple and does not have spices, but it can be eaten.\"</p><br/><p>Rody gently picked up a slice of the fish and put it into his mouth. The raw fish was unusually tasty. He could not help but exclaim in surprise.</p><br/><p>Nedis laughed. \"How is it? This is something I learned from the dwarfs. Although it is not as authentic, it should be passable.\"</p><br/><p>Rody enjoyed eating the first slice and he could not help but put another two more slices in his mouth. Although they had the smell of raw fish, the smell was concealed by their delicious taste. He ate happily, and the dozen slices were soon finished.</p><br/><p>Noticing that Nedis had not eaten any, Rody blushed. He then asked, \"What is this? I never expected raw fish to taste this good.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis lightly smiled and replied, \"Just now, when you caught the fishes, did you not notice that there were different types? The fish I grilled earlier were ordinary fish. However, the one I deliberately left behind was different. If I remember correctly, it is a kind of flatfish that is used to make the sashimi.\"</p><br/><p>Rody gave a bitter smile and replied, \"I did not notice any dissimilarities among the fishes.\"</p><br/><p>Rody paused for a while and then smiled again. \"You have not eaten yet. Give me the scimitar. Let me try to cut.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis did not object and handed over the fish and the scimitar to Rody. Rody recalled Nedis\u2019 movements when cutting the fish and then went ahead to cut it into a dozen pieces within a short moment.</p><br/><p>Nedis looked at Rody with a pair of smiling eyes but she did not eat the fish.</p><br/><p>Rody was startled. \"What\u2019s wrong? Did I cut it wrong?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis shook her head and replied, \"You cut it right. With your ability, you could clearly remember the method of cutting the fish...However, if you could learn it so easily, then the dwarfs\u2019 special delicacy would not be so rare.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis stretched out two of her finger and twisted a thin slice of fish as she smiled. \"Look, even though you cut well, but the sizes of the slices are different. There are many ways of cutting the fishes. The method I used earlier was a thin slice method. In addition, there are also many other methods, like flat cutting, peeling, line cutting and 'snake belly' cutting...You are skillful enough to fight against Paladins, but you are still far from cutting out authentic sashimi.\"</p><br/><p>Rody did not believe her and put a slice of the fish in his mouth. However, he spat it out after two bites. Nedis laughed. \"Don\u2019t you know fishes have bones? The slices that I cut out for you earlier was done with special attention. Your haphazard way of cutting actually pushed all the fish bones into the flesh...\"</p><br/><p>The two of them laughed together for a while and the original distance between them gradually faded.</p><br/><p>After resting on the beach for a while, the two of them finally went inland.</p><br/><p>Although the sea battle was at a distance from the coast, the sounds of explosions at the sea could be heard clearly in the quiet of the night. There were some small dwarf villages near the sea, but the residents had already fled when they heard the sounds of battle.</p><br/><p>After walking for some time, the two of them found an abandoned village. They looked for a household and took a few pieces of clothing. Nedis no longer needed to expose her seductive legs.</p><br/><p>Nedis only felt relieved after putting on these clothes. Although she did not mind exposing her body in front of Rody, it was very cold by the beach, both day and night. She was thinly dressed and although she did not complain she felt so cold that she could hardly stand it anymore.</p><br/><p>Both of them were not in a hurry and rested at the village for half a day. In the evening, those who ran away, because they were frightened of the war, had returned.</p><br/><p>That was the first time Rody saw the legendary dwarfs.</p><br/><p>The dwarfs were not much different from the other races. The majority of them looked just like normal people.</p><br/><p>According to legend, the dwarfs were short and sturdy. They had long beards regardless whether they were men or women, old or young. They had deep, resonant voices and were irascible and queer.</p><br/><p>However, those dwarfs looked just like ordinary humans. The only difference was that they were shorter than ordinary humans.</p><br/><p>Most of the men here were much shorter than Rody. Rody was considered tall among the ordinary people while the tallest dwarf here only reached Rody\u2019s chest. The majority of the men here were only about one and a half meters tall.</p><br/><p>The dwarfs saw that Rody and Nedis were alone, and were not at all friendly with them in the beginning. Those men, especially, looked at Nedis with a shine in their eyes. It looked like they did not have good intentions.</p><br/><p>When Rody saw a crowd gradually gathering, he initially wanted to communicate with them. However, Nedis gently pulled Rody and whispered, \"Don\u2019t say too much. You do not know their language. Besides that, the dwarfs are naturally fierce and greedy. They like to bully the weak. If you are fierce, they will be afraid. If you are polite, they will bully you.\"</p><br/><p>At first, Rody did not believe. However, he saw a few dwarfs pick up their knives and other weapons and surround him. Some of them also started to shout. Rody felt helpless and could only sigh.</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly moved like lightning towards the crowd. A few dwarfs immediately screamed and their weapons all flew into the air. After that, Rody grabbed two dwarfs and returned to Nedis\u2019 side. Based on his size, holding the two dwarfs in his hand was just like carrying two little chicks.</p><br/><p>Nedis put on a fierce expression and spoke some gibberish loudly in a language that Rody could not understand. She then pointed at Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody saw Nedis wink at him. He understood and made a fierce expression. Although his acting was not too good, his fighting skills earlier were too amazing. He had hit seven to eight people in an instant. On top of that, he was tall. That made the dwarfs more fearful and could not help but step back.</p><br/><p>Nedis muttered a few words again and then she pointed at the two dwarfs held by Rody. She then forcefully moved her hand across her throat.</p><br/><p>Those surrounding dwarfs screamed in fear, one after another. They then came crashing down on their knees on the ground.</p><br/><p>At night, the villagers gave up the largest house in the village for Rody and Nedis to stay. The dwarfs, one by one, sent food over from their homes.</p><br/><p>They also sent two women with delicate features to serve Rody. The two women had flattering smiles and were obedient. They did not look as though they were coerced. A slightly older male dwarf stood in front of Rody and spoke. Rody could not understand a word he said while Nedis constantly conversed with the man.</p><br/><p>The dwarf\u2019s face became more and more respectful but Rody could faintly sense a strange feeling from his expression. It was as if a ferocious and malicious expression was concealed beneath the respectful expression.</p><br/><p>When Nedis saw Rody looking impatient, she waved for the dwarf to leave. The two women fanning Rody and massaging his legs were also asked to leave.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s wrong? Why do you have such a cold expression?\" Nedis seemed to smile.</p><br/><p>Rody sighed. \"I just thought that the dwarfs have no backbones. I only beat up a few of them and they already became so cowardly. Men and even women are the same. They are too submissive and did not even show the slightest bit of resistance. How can a race without a backbone survive until now?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis smiled and lightly said, \"You only saw them like this, but you did not see them from another angle.\"</p><br/><p>She sighed and continued, \"The dwarfs are naturally cunning. In the face of a strong enemy that they themselves know they cannot win, they will become meek like slaves. They will even be willing to sacrifice their own women in order to survive! However, their hearts will never have true submission and will always watch you like a wolf. Once they find an opportunity, they will suddenly bite you! They are respectful and submissive to us now. This is because they simply have not found a way to deal with us yet.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh?\" Rody felt a little strange.</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\" Nedis grunted and then continued, \"Talking about being savage, there are no races more savage than the dwarfs. If it was not because you showed impressive strength and shook them, I am afraid both of us would\u2026You would be killed cruelly, and as for me\u2026Well, just by looking at the gazes of those men, you will understand.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis blushed as she said the last few words. She then coughed gently before continuing, \"Do not doubt it. The savagery of the dwarfs is well-known. The Gordon Kingdom had suffered a lot of that. The location of Gordon Kingdom meant they had to constantly pass through the dwarf\u2019s territorial seas. They are often robbed with nothing left. Most pirates would rob the ship, but they would not kill. However, if they were to encounter a dwarf's warship, not only would they be robbed, the people would also not be spared. The men would be killed and the women\u2026</p><br/><p>\"This kind of enemy can only be dealt with by suppressing them with absolute strength. Otherwise, you can only wait to be oppressed!\" Nedis sighed. \"I lived with the dwarfs for a few years and can understand them a little. Their rule of survival is to oppress enemies weaker than themselves. As for enemies stronger than themselves, they will obediently comply and silently endure! They would secretly look for a chance at all times. If you were deceived by their appearance, you must be prepared to be bitten by them!\"</p><br/><p>Rody frowned. \"It seems that this race is really terrifying.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis sighed. \"Isn\u2019t it true? When the dwarfs went to war with the Roland Continent, the Teuton Kingdom of the Roland Continent had conquered one of the dwarf cities. At that time, the entire city completely surrendered. They even went to the extent of offering their wives and women so that they could be spared! The entire army of Teuton Kingdom believed that such submissive people would be of no threat. The Teuton Kingdom was known as the knight\u2019s birthplace and was where the Knight\u2019s Spirit originated from. The soldiers also kept the Knight\u2019s Spirit and did not abuse the local dwarfs. However, with the truce that was sent out by the Temple, they were ordered to withdraw their troop and no longer allowed to attack the dwarfs anymore. However, when the army Teuton Kingdom was withdrawing from the dwarfs' island nation, they were ambushed by the dwarfs.\"</p><br/><p>Rody frowned. \"An ambush after the truce? Were the dwarfs not afraid of starting another war?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, the dwarfs naturally were confident. I heard that they had something that the Temple was very afraid of.\" Nedis sneered and lightly said, \"Teuton army did not expect the seemingly submissive dwarfs to suddenly turn hostile, overnight. Five thousand soldiers were killed in the ambush and three thousand soldiers were captured. After that, the prisoners were all cruelly killed by the dwarfs and Teuton Kingdom was not even given a chance to redeem the prisoners of war. The Teuton Kingdom was also the only landlocked kingdom on the Roland Continent. Their lands were not near the sea and they did not have a navy. So, the dwarfs were not afraid that the Teuton Kingdom would retaliate!\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed. \"What happened after that? Did the Temple come forward to help the Teuton Kingdom? I heard that the Teuton Kingdom is the Temple\u2019s strongest supporter. Even this time, when the Temple turned hostile against the numerous kingdoms of Roland Continent, Teuton Kingdom did not participate in our alliance. They continued to support the Temple.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis smiled. \"So what? The dwarfs are weak when they should be weak and unyielding when it is time for them to be unyielding. They were certain that the other party could not do anything to them and naturally would not apologize. Therefore, that matter was left unsettled.\"</p><br/><p>When Nedis saw Rody was silent, she smiled, \"The most interesting thing was not that...The dwarfs later declared that they were the victorious nation. According to the dwarfs record on history, the dwarfs won that war. After a bloody and tenacious struggle by the army of the dwarfs, the coalition armies of the Roland Continent were finally defeated and chased out of their territory...As for the fact that they had to compromise and how they later launched ambushes after the truce, these were naturally not mentioned at all.\"</p><br/><p>The next day, Rody and Nedis had a brief discussion. Rody wanted to find a ship and return to the Sauron Kingdom directly. Although they were surrounded by the coast, he could only find a few small fishing boats. If such small fishing boats were to encounter a big storm, they would not be able to sail. Besides that, Rody was also not an expert at sea.</p><br/><p>With his strength, although he was able to fly, a Domain Master was, after all, not God. Flying across the entire Straits with his own power was impossible for him. Even if with the Staff of Moses, he could only walk freely inside the sea...</p><br/><p>Nedis suddenly smiled. \"You have listed so many reasons but in actual fact, you are just looking for excuses!\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Rody froze for a moment.</p><br/><p>Nedis smiled, \"With your strength, you have hundreds of ways you can use to go back. But right now, you are just looking for an excuse. Is it because deep down in your heart you do not want to immediately return?\"</p><br/><p>Rody stayed silent.</p><br/><p>Nedis\u2019 eyes suddenly shined as she whispered, \"You said that King Sauron wanted you to help take something from the dwarfs. I can see that although you are not willing to help them, you are still curious about this thing. I guess you are extremely interested in this thing that could coerce the Temple and want to have a look...am I right?\"</p><br/><p>Rody thought for a while then laughed, \"You are really smart. You can accurately guess my thoughts. Yes, I am really curious. What magical thing do the dwarfs have that the Temple is so afraid of?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis rolled her eyes and continued to smile. \"Oh, right. You are not just curious. You are also thinking about the benefits of obtaining this thing. Perhaps you can threaten the Temple with it. After all, the Temple will still be an enemy in the future and it will be better to have an additional chip in hand.\" Nedis then smiled as she looked at Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and said, \"Alright, alright. You are the worm in my stomach1, satisfied?\"</p><br/><p>Feeling dissatisfied, Nedis wrinkled her eyebrows and said, \"Don\u2019t describe me with such a dreadful thing!\"</p><br/><p>Since they had made up their minds, they were no longer anxious to go back immediately. They were determined to go deeper inland into the dwarfs' territory.</p><br/><p>However, a small incident happened before leaving.</p><br/><p>In the morning, a group of dwarfs brought a prisoner back to the village.</p><br/><p>That old man looked exhausted and the clothes on his entire body were soaked. His beard and hair looked plastered on his face. Rody was surprised when he looked at him.</p><br/><p>That person was actually Master Sith.</p><br/><p>The dignified and highest ranked sorcerer amongst the sorcerers of the Sorcerer Association of Roland Continent was actually being tied up like a dog. Besides that, he looked as though he had been robbed. Sith initially had a few magic rings on his fingers, but now the rings were on the fingers of two dwarfs. Even the staff, which was mounted with magical gems, was also taken by one of the dwarfs.</p><br/><p>Some of the other dwarfs also showed greedy and satisfied smiles. Apparently, they had reaped good benefits. That was not strange as a sorcerer would definitely carry with him a lot of magic gems. To a sorcerer, those gems were valuable materials for magic. However, to an ordinary person, it was just tempting wealth and money.</p><br/><p>Sith wearily drooped his eyelids. Rody looked at that old man in that sorry situation and could not help but sigh. He told Nedis to ask the dwarfs to stop and release Sith.</p><br/><p>Rody supported the sorcerer up and sighed, \"Master Sith, why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>Sith finally opened his eyes and looked at Rody. He then smiled bitterly and slowly said, \"I have exhausted my magic power in the battle and then the ship sank. I then drifted ashore. When I saw some people, I wanted to ask for help, but I ended up getting caught and brought here without reason.\"</p><br/><p>Rody held back his laughter and said, \"You are about as powerful as a Paladin. How did you end up like that?\"</p><br/><p>The old sorcerer became angry and replied, \"Kid, we took a lot of trouble to plan this. Although we had not been entirely honest with you, we had never treated you unfairly. Yet you actually just walked away! I may be powerful, but do you think I could win against a fleet? Those dwarfs saw the King\u2019s banner on the flagship and converged on us. If I had not jumped into the sea in time, I am afraid I would have been captured by now!\"</p><br/><p>After saying all that, the old sorcerer sighed. \"I was seasick on the ship for the past few days. After tossing about for so many days, I was already not feeling good. Hmph, if only it had happened on normal days\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed. Although he did not know how dreadful seasickness was, he had witnessed it in his first sea trip to the Roland Continent. Some of his subordinates were quite powerful warriors. However, they were seasick and vomited every day. On top of that, he had no appetite. After a few days, even those strong men were finally unable to withstand it. Despite having the strength of powerful warriors, some of them could not even hold their swords.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the old sorcerer was obviously severely weakened.</p><br/><p>Nedis told the dwarfs to release Sith and also ordered them to return his things. They were not willing because Sith, who was the dignified top sorcerer of the Roland Continent, had a lot of good stuff. However, with the presence of such a strong Rody, they could only obediently return everything.</p><br/><p>After changing his clothes and resting for half a day, Sith finally regained a little bit of his strength. He had also long vomited out the seawater he drank earlier. Sith became excited when he heard that Rody had decided to go deeper into the dwarfs' territory. However, Rody\u2019s following sentence stifled him, \"I am just curious and want to see that thing. Don\u2019t expect me to help you get it!\"</p><br/><p>The three of them stayed at the village for another day. After that day, they continued journeying on the road.</p><br/><p>There were no horses in the village and the three of them could only walk. Fortunately, Rody had looked at the map when he was at the sea. He knew that there would be a slightly larger town after walking for about half a day. It would not be too late to look for horses then.</p><br/><p>However, after less than an hour on the road, the three of them encountered a group of dwarf cavalry patrol. Those soldiers actually came looking for Rody and the others.</p><br/><p>Although the dwarfs at the earlier village looked submissive on the surface, they had already secretly sent a messenger deeper inland. Those soldiers came here to capture Rody and the others.</p><br/><p>They were confronted by about thirty cavalrymen. Rody easily defeated them all and took a few horses. The three of them were thus spared the hardships of walking.</p><br/><p>After journeying for half a day, they finally reached that slightly larger town.</p><br/><p>There were not much different between dwarf towns and the towns Rody had seen on the Roland Continent. The only difference was that the tradition of the excellent weapon forging skills of the dwarfs was true. Even a small town like that also had a few weapon shops. Rody casually strolled around and found a few good swords. It seemed like the dwarfs really deserved their reputation in forging weapons.</p><br/><p>The three of them walked on the streets for a while. As the three of them looked very different from the dwarfs, they attracted the attention of many. Besides that, the army of Sauron Kingdom had landed in the south. News of war had already spread to them. Rody and the others did not look like dwarfs and therefore attracted a lot of unfriendly gazes.</p><br/><p>Sith was already prepared. Before coming, in accordance with the plan of moving around the dwarf island while cooperating with Rody, a few things had already been prepared by Sith.</p><br/><p>He took out two magic gems and gave it to Rody and Nedis. After chanting an incantation, their appearances changed.</p><br/><p>These were two transformation magic gems. In order to conserve the usage of sorcery power, Sith did not change too much the appearances of Rody and Nedis. Sith just shortened their heights and then after some simple make-up, they looked like a dwarf couple.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Sith had powerful sorcery and could just transform himself, solving his own appearance problem.</p><br/><p>The only problem was that Sith did not account for an additional person, Nedis. He had originally prepared the two magic gems for Rody and himself. Now, one gem had already been given to Nedis. As a result, he could only rely on his own sorcery to change his appearance and more magic manna was consumed.</p><br/><p>They spent money to buy a carriage and hired two dwarf coachmen. The three of them then went deeper inland.</p><br/><p>Originally the three of them had jumped into the sea before coming ashore. They did not carry any money with them, so Rody naturally had none and Nedis was the same as she barely even managed to put on her clothes before being pulled into the sea by Rody. On the other hand, the old sorcerer had originally prepared some money for expenses. However, he did not take it along in his haste.</p><br/><p>Finally, they obtained an idea. They sold a few of Sith's magic gems at the small town for a few of the dwarf gold coins. As the magic gems were of high quality and precious, the old sorcerer felt hurt selling them. However, this did not cross Rody\u2019s mind at all.</p><br/><p>The destination for the three of them was a medium sized city known as Home River. That was the second largest town in the dwarfs\u2019 Hakone Kingdom. As the place was located in a basin between two mountains, it was known as the Mountain Gateway.</p><br/><p>Along the way, they met a lot of mobilized soldiers. Those soldiers went towards the south. Apparently, Sauron Kingdom\u2019s attacks gave the dwarfs a lot of pressure. The news that came was that the Sauron Kingdom had driven straight in for a past few days. As King Sauron had a good intelligence knowledge of the situation and he also took advantage to launch a surprise attack, they did not encounter any significant resistance and several of the dwarfs\u2019 armed forces were defeated.</p><br/><p>However, that gave Rody a certain degree of trouble. The deeper they went, the tighter the security and investigation. It seemed this was a precaution against enemy spies.</p><br/><p>They bribed the officers guarding at the city gate of the Home River city and successfully entered the city.</p><br/><p>The dwarfs\u2019 second largest city was indeed very prosperous. There were pedestrians on the streets but the tensions before a war could be felt. Many of the pedestrians were carrying large bags of daily necessities. The streets were also frequently patrolled by the soldiers.</p><br/><p>Rody was extremely relaxed as he looked at the scenery. The dwarfs\u2019 architectural style was completely different from the Roland Continent. Perhaps because they lived on the island and were often harassed by typhoons, their buildings were mostly short and low-rise. Most of the dwarf pedestrians were men wearing swords at their waists. These men deliberately opened up their shirts at the chests and they looked aggressive. They shoved around in the streets and some of them were carrying jugs of wine looking drunk.</p><br/><p>Some of these people tended to walk in groups.

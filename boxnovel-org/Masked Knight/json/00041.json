She severely warned him not to say such things in front of others. Rody did not defend himself and merely promised her that. Nicole was still concerned and continued to say more but Rody patiently explained himself. \"Nicole, I already said I am an insignificant person. These ideas, even if I think about it, I would not tell anyone other than you. Isn't the bitterness I experienced the past few days not enough? I voice some of my opinions aloud and the teachers already treated me as a deviant. Think carefully, have you not been punishing me a lot lately? I have already learned not to speak so much.\"</p><br/><p>Nicole was immediately speechless and her face turned red. The past few days, although she did punish Rody, most of it was not because of Rody's opinions but because of her jealousy. Especially when Jojo kissed Rody, Nicole could not sleep out of anger.</p><br/><p>With a red face, Nicole changed the topic and talked about Seth's usual habits. This is because Rody would need to pretend to be Seth when he returns to the Academy. Nicole introduced the people acquainted with Seth during his time in the Academy to Rody. She also explained their family backgrounds and Seth's relationship with them. Nicole expended all her efforts on her little brother. Seth's bodyguard was originally arranged by Nicole. However, the bodyguard was later bought over by Seth, Even then, Nicole's understanding of Seth's habit should be mostly correct.</p><br/><p>The more Rody listened, the heavier his head felt. He not only needed to remember a lot of people that he did not recognize, he also needed to recognize their appearance, their speech styles, and their preferences. This was more tiresome than the monstrous training by Instructor Carter. Even if Rody had extraordinary perseverance, he was still unable to understand these concepts that he has no knowledge in. To Rody, a stranger is just a name and to expect him to remember various information of strangers and then needed to pretend like he knew them for a long time, gave him a headache.</p><br/><p>On top of that, it was more than one person...</p><br/><p>Nicole gave Rody a register containing all sorts of information. For three full days, she stopped all of Rody's other classes. Rody only needed to concentrate on remembering the information on the register in his room. Instructor Carter had no objection to this. In his opinion, the Young Master's progress can only be described as 'abnormal'. Carter could not understand why the Young Master, who was initially so weak that any of his disciples could easily defeat, suddenly became so strong that even his strongest disciple was severely injured instead.</p><br/><p>Instructor Carter's report to Nicole was: If the Young Master were to take the assessment right now, he could easily pass the third-grade warrior assessment. Fourth-grade warrior assessment would not be too much of a problem.... If he could do it like the time he fought Randt and used that sword, it is possible for him to pass the fifth-grade warrior assessment too.</p><br/><p>The other scholars and teachers felt happy. Although the Young Master was smart, he has too many preposterous ideas. If they had to deal with him every day, they would go crazy and start frothing at the mouth. Might as well stay at home peacefully....</p><br/><p>Just like that, three quiet and boring days passed by quickly. Rody's head was now filled with all kinds of information on various people. Early in the morning, Nicole asked Angel to help him dress up and Rody was soon wearing the standard noble's uniform of the Imperial Academy.</p><br/><p>The only surprise to Rody was that there was a star embroidered onto Seth's original uniform!</p><br/><p>It represents the identity of a warrior!</p><br/><p>Of course, Rody would not believe that the real Young Master possesses the strength of a first-grade warrior. He believes that the Tulip family's influence must have been used to pass the first-grade examination.</p><br/><p>Feeling nervous, Rody followed Nicole onto the carriage.</p><br/><p>The magnificent luxury carriage was surrounded by guards riding on horses. Old Mark was also leisurely holding his whip. Rody felt like he was going towards the execution grounds.</p><br/><p>In the carriage, Rody wanted to ask Nicole a question, something that he has been wanting to do for several days now.</p><br/><p>His question was about his recommended actions if he were to encounter another one of Seth's lovers. This is because the information Nicole gave him had nothing with female acquaintances. At this moment, Rody has already learned a lot about Seth. He wouldn't be so na?ve as to believe that Jojo was Seth's only lover. He wanted to know what to do if he were to encounter this problem.</p><br/><p>However, Rody did not know how to ask this question, ever since Jojo inconvenienced him, Rody was apprehensive at how Nicole got angry over this issue. He does not want to ask this question and accidentally provoke Nicole's wrath. The consequences would be terrible</p><br/><p>Rody listened to the gentle ringing of the carriage bells and took a deep breath. He then opened the windows of the carriage to look out.</p><br/><p>The wide limestone road lead directly to the Imperial Academy and was filled with pedestrians. Rody looked at the buildings of the Imperial Academy that were becoming clearer. The Imperial Academy's most famous building, the White Tower, also seemed to be getting closer. The sweat at Rody's hands also started to gather.</p><br/><p>\"I wonder how is Star right now. Nicole said that she has already released him. Would he be worried about me? There is also Instructor Shale. I suddenly disappeared and did not appear for the first-grade warriors' examination. He must be very disappointed in me. In fact, I am his favorite student. And....uh....\"</p><br/><p>Rody has never been so nervous, nor has he felt so glorified before.</p><br/><p>The current Principal of the Imperial Academy, Sir Sowell, together with most of the important and powerful elders in the Academy, personally came out to greet him. The old guy was a very important person that a commoner like him, in normal days, would never be able to meet. Right now this person was standing at the gates, smiling. His smile lines were all bunched together forming wrinkles. He extended his hands, that looked like the chicken claws, to help Miss Nicole get down the carriage.</p><br/><p>Rody did not truly understand Sir Sowell's flattery for Nicole and did not gain any attention or any concern for his 'sickness'. He just stood beside Nicole showing a reluctant appearance. In regards to this attitude, nobody suspected a thing. This is because everyone in the academy was aware that the Tulip family's Young Master is a playboy. It was common knowledge that Seth's role in the academy was to get himself into trouble and hated wasting his time in the academy. The amount of time he actually spent in the academy was less than the amount of time he secretly escaped the academy.</p><br/><p>\"Sir Sowell, my brother has not fully recovered. Considering that he will soon participate in the assessment to inherit the title, the time he has left in the academy is also not much. At first, I was thinking that he should not come back but then I also think that he needs some final training. As I cannot provide him with these final training, at home, I brought him here, hoping that he can receive strict instructions.\"</p><br/><p>After that, Rody no longer listened to the conversation with Sir Sowell. He started to break out in cold sweat. This is because he saw several young ladies walking around. Naturally, they were also students at the Imperial Academy. Among them, a few already threw flirtatious looks towards him. Rody understood its significance. Shit! It would seem that the playboy really did have more lovers than just Jojo!</p><br/><p>Of course, the eyes of the male students were not so friendly towards him.</p><br/><p>Nicole pretended to have a stern look as she made the situation clear for Rody and then while everyone is not paying attention, gave him a gentle look. After that, she went back to the carriage.</p><br/><p>Just before leaving, Old Mark walked up to Rody and before Rody could react, he already stuffed something hard into his hand.</p><br/><p>\"If you meet with something troublesome that you cannot settle, crush that thing. No matter where you are, I will come and help you.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

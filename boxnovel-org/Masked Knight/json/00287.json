Anger grew in Kara's eyes. Whether as an ancient Devil God or the leader of the Temple, both these positions were way above the masses; he was never talked to in that kind of tone before.</p><br/><p>Sky was an outrageous person. Otherwise, he would not be the Roland Continent's strongest Paladin that had once betrayed the Temple and then hid at some corner of the world. He even dared to challenge the Mystic Dragon as though he was someone who was tired of living.</p><br/><p>They glared at each other in midair and sparks seemed to fly. Sky then turned his head around. He looked at Rody and said, \"Boy, I am at a disadvantage unarmed. Give me your sword.\"</p><br/><p>After taking Rody's Dragon Spell Scimitar, Sky gently flicked its blade. There was a light and resonant humming sound. The Hakone Serpent had already cornered the wyvern into a difficult position. The wyvern was so afraid of the Hakone Serpent that it finally started to fight back as it could not run anymore. The wyvern cried out and spat its dragon's breath at the Hakone Serpent. Although the wyvern was much bigger than a human, it could clearly be seen from afar that when compared to the Hakone Serpent, it was just like a dog barking at a tiger.</p><br/><p>The Hakone Serpent roared. One of the heads ignored the dragon's breath and then bit the wyvern's neck.</p><br/><p>Its bite was so powerful that the wyvern was bitten into two.</p><br/><p>Sith immediately felt gloomy. He then sat down on the ground with a pale expression and no longer stood back up.</p><br/><p>\"Ugly creature! Watch the great Sky come and teach you a lesson!\" Sky shouted at the Hakone Serpent as he flew up with a commanding presence.</p><br/><p>The Hakone Serpent's half head seemed to have already stopped healing itself. However, that head was still alive and seemingly on its last legs. It glared at Sky with one eye, looking like a goldfish.</p><br/><p>With the scimitar in hand and a vigor that was even stronger than earlier, Sky roared loudly and charged again at the Hakone Serpent.</p><br/><p>Although he and Kara were at odds, he still clearly heeded Kara's words. Although Sky was bold and reckless, he was not mad. From the few blows he had endured, he knew that this monster was not an ordinary opponent.</p><br/><p>Rody only had enough time to shout, \"Wait for a chance and attack that half-broken head.\" Sky had already rushed towards the Hakone Serpent like a fierce wind.</p><br/><p>For a time, the man and the snake fought in the skies. It was called a battle, but Sky was just flying around the snake. The Hakone Serpent was continually provoked to attack Sky while he used his speed advantage to dodge and strike back when its guard was down.</p><br/><p>Several people on the ground were watching with excitement. They could hear the sounds of battle in the sky. The strange Fatty and the Hakone Serpent were locked in a fierce battle. Sometimes, they could see Fatty slash the snake's body. The blade struck its scales causing sparks and issuing metallic sounds. The other snake heads were also protecting the half-broken head.</p><br/><p>Sky had been happily slashing the snake left and right with his scimitar. But suddenly he put away the sword behind his back as he could feel his hands tremble. Sky then soared straight up into the sky, turned around and pointed his finger at the Hakone Serpent. He then threw wind blades towards the snake. However, the Hakone Serpent was seemingly tired and did not react. Instead, it just breathed out fire in response.</p><br/><p>Rody watched in alarm below. Nedis was anxious beside him but she could not do anything. Rody was worried about Sky. Although Sky's domain power was at the peak, he was still far below the level of the Hakone Serpent. He did not notice that Kara had retreated too at some point in time.</p><br/><p>Sky was shouting as he fought in the sky, \"This is great! I have not fought so happily for a long time!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the battle in the sky Kara started to realize something ...</p><br/><p>'Right now there are three people with domain powers here. That Fatty looked like he was just kidding and fooling around but his domain power skill and control outshine Rody's.'</p><br/><p>Without realizing it Kara had ended up standing far behind Nedis and Sith. He just stared at the sky and waited quietly...</p><br/><p>Sure enough, after fighting for a while, the snake had been wounded once again. This was because it had fought a long battle with several people with domain powers taking turns. Besides that, the Dragon Spell Scimitar in Sky's hands had left a lot of scars on Hakone Serpent's body. The snake seemed to roar endlessly but it was obviously becoming weaker. Its roar started to be filled with pain and sorrow instead of anger.</p><br/><p>Finally, Sky found an opportunity. He whizzed around two heads and instantly arrived at the Hakone Serpent's half-head. He then raised the sword in his hand and swung it down.</p><br/><p>There was a cutting sound as that half-head was cut off. The snake's body sprayed out blood. Sky was not prepared for this, so he could not help but curse, \"Damn! It is so smelly!\"</p><br/><p>He backed away quickly and was about to fly back when he heard Rody shout, \"Don't retreat! The fewer heads it has, the weaker it would become! All of its heads need to be cut off before it is defeated!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aha!\" Sky laughed. \"Cut off all of it? That is not difficult!\"</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the Hakone Serpent started to retreat.</p><br/><p>The monster knew that the enemy in front of it was not easy to deal with. After considering its own condition it gradually retreated.</p><br/><p>Sky became spirited and shouted, \"Ugly monster! Accept your death!\"</p><br/><p>At this time, one of the Hakone Serpent's heads opened its mouth and spat out something that looked like a red sun.</p><br/><p>The dazzling red light surprised Sky for a moment. He could faintly sense an evil feeling from the red light.</p><br/><p>Rody was naturally aware that it was Kara's 'Divine Primordial Spirit'.</p><br/><p>That thing had helped the snake to block some of the attacks. But now that it had no other alternative, it was forced to use this treasured item.</p><br/><p>The Divine Primordial Spirit gradually helped the snake regain the red glow in its body. The snake also seemed to weep; it only had four heads remaining and its size seemed to be contracting.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Kara's voice came from behind Sky. At some point in time, Kara had already flown up to Sky's side. He pulled Sky down and then whispered, \"Right now, there is a chance to get rid of this thing! However, your help is necessary!\"</p><br/><p>\"Speak!\"</p><br/><p>Kara sighed, \"The Hakone Serpent is a supernatural being. It won't die even if you kill it. However, it is not difficult to seal it. You just need to take out that large red pearl\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Sky then sneered and interrupted Kara, \"Stop speaking rubbish and just say it straight!\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Kara could not help but look at Sky and said, \"Both of us may have strong domain powers. However, even if we cut off its last head, it will reincarnate with eight heads. This thing cannot be killed. Making it weaker would only allow it to feel pain. As it is a supernatural being with an immortal body, it will simply come back to life even if you kill it.\"</p><br/><p>Sky frowned and asked, \"What do you mean?\"</p><br/><p>\"The key is that pearl!\" He then lowered his voice and said, \"That pearl is currently its biggest weakness. It was sealed here for that red pearl. We just\u2026\" He paused and then gritted his teeth, \"Right now, I could only recover a bit of energy. Rody is probably in the same situation as me right now.\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed bitterly and replied, \"Yes. Right now, I feel like my body is an empty shell.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right!\" Kara then said, \"As long as we can get that pearl, I will have a way to seal it!\" Kara did not want to say 'Divine Primordial Spirit' as he did not want Fatty to know his identity. Rody then coldly said, \"Mister Kara, just now you said that the snake can be killed off after it has one head left. Now, you say it cannot be killed but could only be sealed. In the end, you just want us to help you get the Divine Primordial Spirit. Am I right?\"</p><br/><p>Kara's tone was unchanged as he coldly replied, \"The Hakone Serpent is powerful. If we do not beat it until its present condition, how are we supposed to grab my Divine Primordial Spirit? Besides that, I would be able to get rid of it once I obtain my Divine Primordial Spirit! How could it be said that I deceived you? I have clearly told you that I fought it thousands of years ago. I had also cut off a few of its heads until it has one head left. Do you know what happened after that?\"</p><br/><p>Kara looked at Rody and said, \"After being crushed by me, it reincarnated in a red light. On top of that, it recovered with eight heads.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Rody exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Kara faintly said, \"It was like that! Did you think a God ranked beast like that would just die? Even if we kill it, it would just take some time for him to reincarnate. On top of that, it would reincarnate at full strength! However, once I obtain my Divine Primordial Spirit, we no longer need to fear it.\"</p><br/><p>Rody angrily shouted, \"Bullshit! Didn't you tell me it was defective?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha\u2026\" Kara laughed. \"What do you consider defective? It does not matter if it was the Hakone Serpent or the Mystic Dragon. These are things those bastards in heaven created to deal with me! The Hakone Serpent was easily defeated by me. Naturally, it could only be regarded as defective! However, it having an immortal body is not a lie!\"</p><br/><p>Sky did not speak and was listening to the conversation between the two. He then looked surprised and said, \"Wait! What did you say? What is Kara? What is a Divine Primordial Spirit?\" He looked intently at Rody and gritted his teeth. \"Is that glowing red thing the Divine Primordial Spirit?\"</p><br/><p>Kara was slightly surprised and asked, \"Oh? You know about the Divine Primordial Spirit too?\"</p><br/><p>Sky then said, \"Although I have never seen it before, I have heard of it before! Hahaha\u2026A Divine Primordial Spirit. Could it be a God ranked fellow? Who are you really?\"</p><br/><p>Kara lightly replied, \"Didn't you hear my name earlier?\"</p><br/><p>Sky's eyes suddenly changed, \"You are Kara? The True God Kara?\"</p><br/><p>The three wanted to continue talking but the Hakone Serpent seemed to have absorbed a lot of the strange red light from the Divine Primordial Spirit. The wounds on its body started to heal.</p><br/><p>Kara turned pale and said, \"Stop wasting words! Take advantage of the current moment. Although we don't have a plan yet, right now we have three people with strong domain powers here! This is already a strong advantage!\"</p><br/><p>Rody wanted to say something else, but Sky's expression changed and had a thoughtful gaze. Sky suddenly got in front of Rody and said, \"Alright, I will help you!\" He then looked at Kara and asked, \"Tell us. What do you need us to do?\"</p><br/><p>Kara sighed and softly said, \"That Divine Primordial Spirit originally belonged to me. The method to take it back is very simple. The three of us attack at the same time. You, help me to fight the Hakone Serpent from the front. Drag it out and make sure it does not have the time to swallow the Divine Primordial Spirit. Rody, stay at the side and give support. As for me\u2026\" Kara's eyes became firm as he said, \"My only way is to fight for and fuse with the Divine Primordial Spirit!\" He paused for a moment and then said, \"I will rush forward. As long as I can reach the Divine Primordial Spirit, we would have succeeded half the job. However, I do not have much energy now. It is necessary for you all to help me open the way. Do not give it the chance to stop me! If necessary, I even need you all to push me forward!\" Kara then smiled at Sky and said, \"I know you don't like me. That is why, when the time comes for you to kick my ass, just kick me towards the Divine Primordial Spirit!\"</p><br/><p>The Hakone Serpent roared again in the distance. It seemed to have gradually absorbed a lot of the red light. If they still did not attack it, it would really swallow the Divine Primordial Spirit.</p><br/><p>Kara immediately made a decision and shouted, \"The opportunity is here! Go!\"</p><br/><p>Rody and Kara mustered their strength with difficulty. They then charged towards the Hakone Serpent together with Sky.</p><br/><p>One of the heads was absorbing the red light while the remaining three heads immediately faced its enemies' attacks.</p><br/><p>Sky swung the sword and sent a large wind blade towards the snake. The head was knocked down. He then shouted at Rody. \"Boy, come here!\"</p><br/><p>Rody actually could no longer fight directly with the snake. He could just only stay close to Sky.</p><br/><p>Kara had also advanced towards Sky's side. Sky saw an opportunity and suddenly shot out a fireball with his other hand. It struck a snake head, causing it to cry out in pain and move away. Sky suddenly lowered his voice and said to Kara, \"You said I can kick your ass? Then I am going to do it!\"</p><br/><p>Sky suddenly kicked Kara's backside. Kara's body shook and flew forward like lightning.</p><br/><p>However, what surprised Rody was Sky did not kick Kara towards the Divine Primordial Spirit. Kara also felt angry, but he had no time to react. In front of Kara was a snake head whose mouth was wide open.</p><br/><p>\"Fatty! You!\" Rody cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>Sky then grabbed Rody by his collar and carried him towards the Divine Primordial Spirit. The sword in his hands emitted a sharp blade of light as he forced back a snake head that attempted to attack. He then looked at the Divine Primordial Spirit in front of him and said, \"Boy, your opportunity is here!\"</p><br/><p>Sky forcefully swung Rody and then threw him like an arrow towards the Divine Primordial Spirit.</p><br/><p>With a loud sound, Rody was thrown towards the evil looking red sun. His entire body then vanished.</p><br/><p>Sky was delighted that he managed to throw Rody in and was not prepared for a snake head that attacked him from his left. As he could not avoid or block it in time, he was knocked away. When he finally stopped further away in midair he laughed, \"I heard you just needed to fuse with the Divine Primordial Spirit to reach God ranked status! Boy, how will you thank me for this? Kara, oh Kara, did you think I would be so foolish to work myself to the bone for you?\"</p><br/><p>At this time, Kara's enraged voice was heard. Sky had schemed against him and also kicked him towards the mouth of a snake head. Fortunately, in that critical moment, he managed to escape the snake's mouth with his Devil God powers. However, his body was fully covered with blood. He did not know whether the blood was his or the snake's. His hair was disheveled and his body was trembling as he faced Sky and shouted, \"Despicable fellow! How dare you scheme against me!\"</p><br/><p>Sky coldly looked at him and said, \"I schemed against you, but what can you do about it? Hmph. All of you that are known as God-ranked people are all villains. Just looking at you makes me angry! Not slashing you with my sword then is already showing my respects to the elderly!\"</p><br/><p>After that, the irrepressible Fatty ruthlessly slashed at the ancient Devil God in front of him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although he was carrying a person on his shoulder his body moved lightly. The place he was originally standing on cracked with a crisp sound.</p><br/><p>Rody stood on top of the wall on the side of the small road. Rody then raised his hand and hit Nedis\u2019 neck. She fainted without even groaning. Rody then smiled and said, \"Diane. You still like to attack sneakily from the back?\"</p><br/><p>\"Eh?\" Diane then appeared out of thin air several paces away. She looked at Rody who was standing beside a wall and had a mixed expression of grudge and pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>Diane was in a daze as the person she was looking for had suddenly appeared in front of her. This caused her to feel a bit absentminded. She saw Rody jump down from the wall, smiled to her and stood right in front of her. She was shocked. She slapped her face several times. Then she realized she was not dreaming...</p><br/><p>\"You bastard!\" In her anger, she was like a female leopard as she grabbed Rody\u2019s clothes and gnashed her teeth. \"You\u2026 you just left us and Myka there? Do you know how hard we have been searching for you?\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed awkwardly but he did not break free from her grasp. Darke showed a puzzled expression as he looked at Rody with a frown. He asked, \"Diane. Who is he?\"</p><br/><p>Diane gnashed her teeth and replied, \"Him? He is a scoundrel!\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and whispered, \"This is not the place to speak. We\u2026 Ah. Where is Myka? Are you all staying in West Hill City now?\"</p><br/><p>Diane was about to reply when she saw that Rody was still carrying Nedis. Nedis\u2019 proud body was still exposed in broad daylight. Besides that, Rody was holding Nedis\u2019 thigh. She could not help but feel unhappy and coldly said, \"You\u2026 Why are you still carrying her? Have you not had enough of her?\"</p><br/><p>Rody turned red and gently put Nedis down. He had just only made Nedis faint so he did not think of putting her down. He looked at Diane and Darke. Diane was gloomily looking back at him, unwilling to take over. Darke shook his head. He felt that Diane was being strange and sighed. He then stretched out his hands to carry Nedis. Rody finally handed over the problem. He then softly asked, \"What about Myka? Is she with you?\"</p><br/><p>Diane gnashed her teeth and said, \"I\u2026 I will take you there. She is nearby.\"</p><br/><p>Darke frowned and glanced at Diane. Diane nodded towards him and whispered, \"There aren\u2019t any problems. It is just someone feeling restless every day thinking of this bastard!\" After that, Diane hid her own red face and said, \"Darke. Take Nedis back first. I will take him there.\"</p><br/><p>Diane, Myka, and Darke had been living in the Imperial Capital. Myka had made up her mind to follow Rody. She was just waiting for Rody to return from the battlefield. However, she had received news that the Duke was injured in the war. He no longer appeared in public after his triumphant return to the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>Myka sorrowfully thought of Rody every day and worried for the safety of her lover every day. However, she could not do anything. She naturally could not enter the Duke\u2019s mansion. If even the powerful nobles were kept out of the door, a small woman like her would definitely not have a chance.</p><br/><p>Diane feared nothing and was about to break into the mansion but she was stopped by Darke. He was firm and advised her not to mess things up. Even if Diane had sneaked in, she would not be able to meet Rody as he was staying in the Imperial Palace.</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s appearance at the ceremony had shaken the noble circles in the Imperial Capital. However, this matter had involved the Emperor and his privacy, and therefore only the nobles knew. The public did not receive any of this information. Therefore, Myka and her friends would not have news of Rody. As for the newspapers \u2026 they would not dare to mention about the Emperor\u2019s illegitimate child.</p><br/><p>When they heard that the Duke was going to rest and recuperate in his province, the three of them decided to look for the Duke in West Hill. As they could not enquire the date the Duke was leaving, they immediately set out and had already reached West Hill a few days ago.</p><br/><p>Nedis was one of Darke\u2019s friend. When they heard the news that the Duke had arrived in the city, they went to Nedis\u2019 pub to enquire. As the pub was close to the barracks, it was where the military officers usually go to have fun. As a result, it was also the most suitable location. However, Diane ended up fighting with an Imperial Guard which resulted in that previous incident.</p><br/><p>As Rody and Diane continued to walk, Diane was telling him about the three of them. Finally, she asked, \"Why did you not come and see us after returning from the battlefield? Did you not know that we\u2026 that Myka had been waiting for you every day?\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head guiltily and replied, \"The situation in the capital is complicated. As I wanted to get rid of my identity as the Duke, I could not appear in public. I was thinking of waiting for a while before looking for you all.\"</p><br/><p>Diane glanced at Rody silently. She did not hide the resentment in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Both of them felt awkward and the atmosphere turned silent. After a while, Rody asked, \"Who is that Nedis? She is somewhat weird.\"</p><br/><p>Diane looked at Rody coldly and said, \"Hmph. You see a beautiful woman and\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody frowned and replied, \"Nonsense! It is just that Nedis\u2019 behavior was somewhat weird. She had used a spell on me earlier. Is she a magician? But then, it's not quite ....\"</p><br/><p>Diane thought for a moment and said, \"Nedis is Darke\u2019s old friend. Went we arrived at West Hill, Darke took us to meet her. It was thanks to her that we managed to settle down\u2026 You\u2026\" Her expression suddenly changed and said, \"You better not have any bad thoughts!\" Rody smiled and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Diane and the others had stayed near the pub. Nedis had helped them to settle down there. After the fight at the pub, Darke felt worried. They sent Myka back then returned to the pub only to find that the pub was smashed and Nedis was arrested. He then began his chase.</p><br/><p>Rody followed Diane through the small roads taking numerous turns. When they arrived in front of a compound, Diane said, \"This is the place. You have not met for a long time\u2026 I will not go in.\" After that, Diane went away.</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head feeling at a loss. He felt that Diane was acting strange but he could not think too much about it. He took a deep breath and pushed open the front door. He laughed bitterly when he pushed the door \u2014 it was locked from the inside. Rody laughed and jumped over the wall.</p><br/><p>The compound was more spacious than he imagined. There was a small two-storey building inside. Rody went in and climbed up the stairs to a room.</p><br/><p>He gently pushed open the door to the room and stepped in softly. The room had a very simple layout. There was a large bed and the windows were open. There was a breeze as the curtains slowly fluttered. Myka was lying down and quietly resting in the bed.</p><br/><p>Rody quietly went to the bed and looked at Myka.</p><br/><p>Myka's eyebrows were furrowed while she slept. It would seem that her dreams were worrying. Her face looked drained. A black robe was wrapped around her slender and curled-up body. The lower hem of her clothes exposed her legs. Her long black hair blocked half of her face and the rest of it was scattered on top of the pillow.</p><br/><p>Rody quietly knelt in front of the window and quietly watched the beauty sleep. He then slowly stretched out his hand to stroke her face. Rody\u2019s felt a soft spot in his heart stir. He could not resist as he bent down and gently kissed Myka\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\"Mmm\u2026\" The sleeping Myka slowly started to wake up. Her eyes slowly opened to look vacantly in her sleepiness. She glanced at Rody and softly muttered, \"How hateful. I dream of you again.\" After that, she mumbled indistinctly and closed her eyes again...</p><br/><p>\"Hm?\"</p><br/><p>A few seconds later, Myka reopened her eyes, finally waking up. She was still lying down but she stared at Rody. She could not believe her eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" She shouted and jumped from the bed. When she saw Rody smiling at her, she became fully awake. She cried out as she tightly clung to Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody felt Myka\u2019s soft body trembled and the clothes at his shoulder got wet with tears. He slowly pushed Myka away while holding her face. Tears could be seen in her eyes. Her tender gaze made Rody feel crazy.</p><br/><p>\"I finally see you! I finally see you!\" Myka repeatedly said these words. Her eyes were filled with joy and sadness.</p><br/><p>Rody could no longer endure it. The feelings of love in her eyes were something that even idiots could see. He then kissed Myka on the lips...</p><br/><p>It was the first time the two of them kissed affectionately. Myka trembled as if she had an electric shock. She hugged Rody\u2019s neck and then they fell onto the bed.</p><br/><p>Rody embraced Myka tightly. The soft and sweet body was full of temptation. Her lips were cold and soft and were fragrant as the petals of a flower. Rody felt his body was on fire. His innate yearnings were getting more intense.</p><br/><p>Pressing down on Myka\u2019s body he ravaged her gentle lips. Rody\u2019s hands slide down from Myka\u2019s shoulder into her jacket.</p><br/><p>Under her black robe, Myka's skin was delicate, smooth and supple. When Rody touched her skin, Myka could not help but cry out. As her mouth was blocked by Rody, the sound was made with her nose. Her moan seemed to have lighted up a fire. It made Rody even crazier.</p><br/><p>Rody held Myka\u2019s slender waist and moved his hand to the back of the waist. It was probably due to years of dancing practice but her soft waist was strong and did not have a single trace of fat. Rody could not help but held her around her waist. He let her soft body lean on himself. He gradually moved his hand up and cupped her breast, causing her to moan...</p><br/><p>Myka\u2019s body was at first cool but it gradually turned hot as if she had a fever. She twisted her body and wrapped her smooth legs around Rody.</p><br/><p>Their lips finally separated when they were out of breath as they looked at the fire in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Myka took a deep breath and whispered, \"Am I... am I dreaming?\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and replied, \"I am sorry, Myka. I\u2026 I took a long time to come and see you.\"</p><br/><p>Myka laughed calmly and said, \"You don\u2019t need to say more\u2026 I have already made up my mind that I would wait for you no matter how long it takes.\"</p><br/><p>They once again clung tightly together. Rody could smell Myka\u2019s fragrance. He could not help but kiss Myka's face and neck repeatedly. Myka was breathless and moaned. She tightly wrapped her arms around Rody\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s hands suddenly left Myka\u2019s chest. It moved below the chest and to the waist. As the hand continued to move lower slowly, Myka suddenly trembled violently and whispered, \"No. Don\u2019t...\"</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s blood boiled and did not hear Myka. She then struggled harder and begged, \"Don\u2019t be like this. Really. Don\u2019t...\"</p><br/><p>When Rody felt her struggling, his arms froze and he got up. He then looked into Myka\u2019s eyes and said, \"Sorry.\"</p><br/><p>Myka bit her own lip and reached out to Rody\u2019s neck. She then pulled him down and snuggled in his chest. Her face was red and her voice was soft. \"Don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t misunderstand. I am willing to give in to you but\u2026 Not right now.\"</p><br/><p>\"No. No. No...\" Rody\u2019s eyes showed a hint of guilt as he whispered, \"It was my fault. I have offended you.\"</p><br/><p>Myka felt anxious. Her eyes welled with tears as she said, \"No\u2026 It is not what you think. I think of you every day. However, today is not a good day. Please wait for two more days.\"</p><br/><p>Myka smiled shyly when she saw Rody\u2019s confused expression. She then whispered into his ears, \"I\u2026 I don\u2019t feel too good today. That is why they let me come back here to rest first. I \u2026 will be fine in about two days.\" Her voice then turned softer as she said, \"In two days, you can \u2026 do whatever you like.\"</p><br/><p>Rody frowned. His arms held on tightly to Myka arms as he asked, \"You don\u2019t feel good? Are you sick?\"</p><br/><p>Myka immediately blushed. She looked at Rody lovingly and said, \"You fool!\" She then whispered something to Rody. Rody\u2019s face turned red and quickly sat up and hugged Myka.</p><br/><p>The two of them were locked in an embrace as they sat at the bedside. Myka explained about her trip to West Hill from the Imperial Capital. She explained in a very simple manner. However, Rody looked at her sallow face with some pity.</p><br/><p>Myka had grown up in the brothel. She had never experienced the hardships of a long journey. When Rody saw that her face had become thinner, he leaned over and kissed her on her forehead.</p><br/><p>Myka snuggled up to the person she had yearned for day and night. She felt extremely happy and was no longer dejected. She then asked about Rody\u2019s experience.</p><br/><p>Rody felt helpless and described the events of the war in the North simply. He understood and sympathized with Myka. He did not dare to speak of the dangers in the North. At critical points of his story, he would just mention it quickly. However, Myka was exceptionally intelligent. She knew that although Rody's explanation was simple, the situation itself must have been extremely thrilling. She could not help but exclaim again and again.</p><br/><p>When Rody talked until the part where Diane beat up the soldiers in the West Hill, Myka could not help but whisper, \"She is always so impatient. Darke and I could not stop her.\"</p><br/><p>As soon as Myka finished her sentence, Diane\u2019s voice came through from the door. \"Hmph\u2026 I helped you find the person you think of day and night but then you talk bad about me behind my back.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

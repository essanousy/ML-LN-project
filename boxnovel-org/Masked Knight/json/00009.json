The first floor had tables and chairs but these were haphazardly placed. There were containers that Rody did not know the purpose of. There were small jars and vases. There were also shelves packed with neatly arranged books. Glancing at it, Rody could immediately see that these books were really old. They were antique sheepskin books.</p><br/><p>Just these books were worth a lot of money!</p><br/><p>Even creepier was the human skeleton standing at the corner of the room. The eerie white bones seemed to radiate a faint glow in the darkened room. Rody involuntarily walked towards it. To his surprise, there was a red mark on the skull that he could not understand.</p><br/><p>Rody could not help but want to touch the skeleton when his eyes noticed some bottles on an iron shelf. The bottles were made of silver and there were labels on it. Unfortunately, he could not understand the words on it. It was not the text commonly used in the entire empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not touch those bottles!\u201d Nicole\u2019s cold voice called out from behind him.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately withdrew his hands that were reaching out to a bottle.</p><br/><p>Nicole gave Rody a look. Although her face was cold, her tone softened. \u201cSome of these things in the bottles must not be touched. For example, the second bottle in front of you. If you were not careful and spilled it onto your hands, even if it was just a little bit, you would die. Your entire arm would immediately corrode and only leave behind bones!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody was shocked. \u201cAre these all poisons?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole glared at him, saying, \u201cNo! These are all just used for experiments!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody opened his mouth and wanted to say something but Nicole did not give him the opportunity to ask anymore questions and loudly told him, \u201cFollow me upstairs, quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole turned and walked upstairs. Rody quickly followed.</p><br/><p>The second floor was like a big open space. From the railings, one could see the hall on the first floor. There were more things on the second floor compared to the first. It had an old desk that had lost its color along with a strange instrument on top of it. The shelves on the wall were larger and stored 3 times more books compared to the one on the first floor. Rody had not seen this many antique books in his entire life! In the corner, there was also a durable but rusty iron safe. The amount of rust on that thing showed that it was even older than the combined ages of Rody and Nicole.</p><br/><p>In the middle was a large table-like platform with more things scattered on it. There were some jars and bottles and some of them had fallen on the table.</p><br/><p>Rody stepped forward to find a few pieces of old parchment. The messy handwriting on them showed that they were probably some kind of test notes or written records.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a line on the parchment attracted Rody\u2019s interest.</p><br/><p>'Lack of high-pressure utensils\u2026 Failure\u2026 Empire Year XXX. Dandong.'</p><br/><p>\u201cDandong!\u201d Rody could not help but exclaimed, \u201cMy God! This is the wise sage Dandong\u2019s notes!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole looked at Rody lightly and asked, \u201cWhat is the fuss about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss?\u201d Rody cried out. \u201cDangdong\u2019s notes! Do you know how much Dandong\u2019s autograph is worth in the antique market?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole frowned, \u201cWhat about it? All these things here were left behind by the sage Dandong! The shelves placed over there contains Dandong\u2019s test notes. Also, these instruments are relics that Dandong had left behind. During those years, this was Dandong\u2019s laboratory!\u201d</p><br/><p>The great sage's laboratory?</p><br/><p>Rody stared with his mouth wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut... Dandong\u2019s lab\u2026 In your home\u2026 Here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole said indifferently, \u201cThat is because one of my ancestors was Dandong\u2019s apprentice. Grandmaster Dandong lived in our home in his old age and this was his workplace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\"All these\u2026 are the relics of Grandmaster Dangdong's wisdom!\" Rody excitedly exhaled. The sage Dandong was one of the idols he worshiped as he grew up. Without Dandong's reform, civilians like him would not be able to enter the Imperial Academy. Even 10-year-old children in the empire knew that Dandong brought miracles to the empire!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is indeed true! These are really the relics of Grandmaster Dandong\u2019s wisdom! Also, all these were inherited by the ancestors of our family,\u201d Nicole\u2019s tone was also somewhat sad. \u201cUnfortunately, this is also our family\u2019s tragedy! For centuries, none of my ancestors could understand the wisdom from these notes. 3 of my ancestors studied the Grandmaster\u2019s notes here in their later years until they died of mental exhaustion. My father also died in this laboratory!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Was the Grandmaster\u2019s wisdom too difficult and profound?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole smiled gently. It was a fairly odd smile that showed misery.</p><br/><p>\"No idea. We do not know what Dandong's wisdom was even about. This is because no one could understand his most important notes. The most important wisdom in Dandong's notes is not in the common text of our Empire or any language on any continent. We do not even know what language it is!\" Nicole's tone was full of mockery. \"There are times we even suspect that the language Dandong used was God's language! My ancestors went through a variety of ancient books and still could not decipher this language!\"</p><br/><p>\u201cGod\u2019s language?\u201d Rody was surprised. \u201cIs there really God in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly this time Nicole did not glare at him when she angrily said, \"Only a genius would know!\" This was because generations of her family were fascinated by \u2018God's language\u2019 and had futilely worked hard. This had cost the family a lot of time and even claimed their lives. It became a heavy burden for the Tulip Family. As a result, Nicole had no respect for God.</p><br/><p>Rody was surprised and could not help but caress the table and the ancient sheepskin notes gently. He cautiously asked, \u201cCan I take a look at it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole shrugged, \u201cAs you wish. This is just the replica I used to study. The original has already been hidden away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody immediately grabbed the sheepskin notes and spread them out.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the first page of the sheepskin notes was written in the Empire's common language. However, the backs of the notes were written in a different language. The characters were also extremely complex. Each stroke looked like it was delicately cut with a chisel. The structure of the texts was also delicate. Each word looked like square blocks and they also had a special pattern. It was definitely not in any language that Rody could understand.</p><br/><p>Although there were occasionally some designs and drawings, one look would tell you that these were blueprints. Unfortunately, the words written around them were all in \u2018God's language'.</p><br/><p>Nicole ignored Rody who was frowning while staring blankly at the sheepskin. Instead, she walked to the iron cupboard at the corner and chanted something. The iron cabinet then opened. Rody immediately turned to look at it. Although he was a warrior, he was also interested in its operation method. He knew that Nicole used a locking spell. It was a kind of magical technique, a kind of memory magic. It was as if the cabinet could remember the person\u2019s voice and only if the sound matched would it unlock. This technique was also invented by Grandmaster Dandong 200 years ago.</p><br/><p>With Nicole\u2019s back blocking Rody\u2019s view, she pulled out a narrow box from the cabinet and then closed the door of the iron safe.</p><br/><p>Nicole held the box with both hands as if it was a priceless treasure. She carefully placed it on the table before opening it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look at that anymore. My father looked at it for 2 decades while I have looked at it for 7 years. We couldn\u2019t understand a thing. Do you think that you can understand it?\u201d Nicole coldly commented.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you take out? What is that?\u201d Rody was curious.</p><br/><p>Nicole glared at him and waved her sleeves. Rody was immediately thrown back like a sandbag being thrown out and he hit the corner.</p><br/><p>Nicole looked at Rody coldly and said, \u201cYou must have forgotten! I said that when you and I converse, you must address me as \u2018Master\u2019. Now, come over here! Stop playing dead! I know you are a sturdy person. A fall like that wouldn\u2019t even injure you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody mumbled to himself as he stood up. He did not say a single word but secretly cursed. Why is she so ferocious?! One day, I will\u2026 urgh\u2026 Even when she is fierce, why is she so beautiful?! Sigh...</p><br/><p>With these thoughts in mind, Rody walked to the table. When he saw what was in the box, he took a deep breath and almost screamed!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

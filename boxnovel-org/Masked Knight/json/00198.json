Her eyes were like invisible threads that tie up the heart \u2014 they were definitely a kind of formless killers!</p><br/><p>Rody was nervous and tried his utmost to calm down. He was very powerful and murderous, but then, he was still a virgin. Although he was deeply in love with Nicole, he had never seen a woman\u2019s body at such close proximity...</p><br/><p>The woman stared at Rody for a few seconds before she asked, \"You broke my door and hurt my men. Why? Please tell me why.\"</p><br/><p>Rody took a deep breath and tried to make himself look serious. However, he still did not dare to look at her. It did not seem appropriate, from where he was standing.</p><br/><p>\"One hour ago, my men were injured at your place! The people who hurt my men should be one of yours.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2026\" The woman nodded. Her captivating cheeks made her smile look very charming. She then said in her soft and gentle voice, \"So officer. You took your men back to this place?\u2019</p><br/><p>Rody was impatient and he also felt suffocated.</p><br/><p>He had brought his soldiers back there angrily but did not expect to meet a woman like her, with that flirtatious appearance. He found it hard to beat or scold her. Punching her would be like punching cotton.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Rody raised his head and narrowed his eyes. \"A woman did it.\" His tone turned cold as he continued, \"My men are Imperial Guards! Even if they had caused trouble, this should be handled by the security guards! Your people must be really bold to dare raise their hands against the Imperial Guards!\"</p><br/><p>The woman did not feel anxious and casually asked, \"So, how do you want this to be handled? You have already hurt a dozen of my men the moment you arrived...\"</p><br/><p>Rody grunted and coldly said, \"Your men attacked me first. They deserve it! Bring out the people that injured my men. I do not like people playing games with me!\"</p><br/><p>The woman laughed. \"You said that the person who injured your men was a woman. I have a lot of women here\u2026 If you wish to look for someone, do it yourself.\" After that, the woman clapped her hands and said, \"Girls. Come on out, all of you!\"</p><br/><p>The women that ran away from the fight earlier heard the call and came in from the back in twos and threes, their faces smiling. The fear on their faces had already been swept away. These girls then stood around Rody.</p><br/><p>The proprietress then said softly, \"Alright now. Look for the girl yourself. Identify that girl who beat up your men. Do it yourself!\"</p><br/><p>Rody frowned. The women that appeared wore heavy make-up and clothes that were more revealing compared to the proprietress. Their shoulders and legs were exposed. Rody wondered if the things some of the women wore could even be called clothes. The bandages the soldiers used on the battlefield had more material than their clothes!</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s face sank as he gave the two soldiers a meaningful glance. The two soldiers could not help but glance at certain parts of the women\u2019s bodies. Rody's face turned pale and he coldly shouted, \"Are these the ones?\"</p><br/><p>The soldiers trembled and immediately looked away. They then said, \"No! She is not here! That woman was more beautiful than all of them!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aiyoh!\" The proprietress laughed out. \"My girls here are not beautiful? Your words really hurt!\"</p><br/><p>Rody became even more impatient and said, \"I do not have time to go around in circles with you! Are you the boss here? If so, follow me back! I have ways to make you speak!\"</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s expression changed a little but she still laughed and said, \"You want to arrest me? Sure. Why don\u2019t you try...\"</p><br/><p>She stood up and looked coldly at Rody\u2019s two soldiers. The two soldiers' faces turned red and they looked down. They had a hesitant and fascinated expression. They did not dare to step forward.</p><br/><p>Rody coldly said, \"What are you doing? Didn\u2019t you hear my orders? Arrest her!\"</p><br/><p>The two soldiers were startled and finally stretched out their hands. The woman smiled and also obediently held out her hands. She looked as if she was waiting for the soldiers to grab her. However, her hands suddenly emitted sparks. The two soldiers screamed the moment they touched her hands and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>The other women covered their mouths and snickered. It was as if this scene was common. They stood at the side of that woman as though they trusted her. There would be no trouble with her around.</p><br/><p>Rody frowned as he looked at the two soldiers on the ground. He did not feel angry and laughed instead. He said, \"Good! Looks like you are a magician! Just now there were people here asking about the Duke! Looks like things are really not so simple.\" After that, he walked up to her.</p><br/><p>The woman raised her eyebrows and chest as she looked at Rody. She sweetly said, \"What\u2019s wrong? You want to raise your hand against me as well? Come on then...\"</p><br/><p>She welcomed Rody and walked forward to him, purposely pushed her chest up high, her hands outstretched, and her legs apart, and stood there in front of Rody forming the word 'Big1'</p><br/><p>Rody did not like to beat up women. He hesitated for a moment before he pulled her arm. The moment he pulled her, the woman fell into Rody\u2019s arms as if she was extremely soft and had no bones. She raised her head and said, \"You are very strong...\"</p><br/><p>Rody felt his scalp tingle and could not help but step back. The woman laughed and pointed at Rody\u2019s nose as she said, \"This young man is quite strong. Looks like he is still a virgin.\"</p><br/><p>Rody groaned and stretched out his hands towards her chest. When his hand moved, the woman was stunned for a moment. She only screamed the moment Rody's hand touched her chest. She quickly attempted to run away and hide.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph\u2026 Looks like you are just putting on an act!\" Rody\u2019s hand moved and grabbed her shoulder to prevent her from struggling. Her shoulder felt slippery and soft. Without changing his expression, he grabbed her ankle and lifted her up.</p><br/><p>The charming beauty screamed when she was lifted by her leg like a chicken.</p><br/><p>Her robes were also lifted. Her other leg kicked around and her round buttocks and pink underwear were also exposed.</p><br/><p>The group of prostitutes at the side were screaming nonstop. They wanted to pull Rody but then they saw Rody\u2019s stern expression. Rody then drew his sword and fiercely thrust his sword into a table. The men and women around them turned pale and retreated.</p><br/><p>Rody coldly asked while he was still carrying the woman in his hands. \"Are you going to speak now?\"</p><br/><p>The woman he was carrying no longer appeared calm and seductive as she struggled and shouted, \"You bastard! Let me go! Otherwise\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody then coldly interrupted her and said, \"Good! Struggle more! Perhaps your robes would fall off!\"</p><br/><p>These words were more effective than anything else and the woman stopped struggling. She shrank into a ball and even shivered a little.</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s expression did not change and he coldly said, \"I am not someone who shows pity to women! I have killed both men and women! Don\u2019t make me angry. Now, I will ask you questions and you will answer them. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>The woman was silent for a moment before she answered with a red face, \"I understand.\" That red face was not put on to charm anyone but was due to the blood flowing down to her head...</p><br/><p>\"Very good.\" Rody nodded. \"What is your name? Is this your pub?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026 My name is Nedis. This is my pub.\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded and asked a different question, \"Where are the people who fought my men?\"</p><br/><p>Nedis stayed silent for a moment before she loudly replied, \"I do not know them! They are most likely my guests and have left.\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and shouted. \"Lies!\"</p><br/><p>He placed Nedis face down on the table. He pulled out the sword from the table and also her lifted up her robes, revealing her backside.</p><br/><p>Nedis was really afraid now and was about to cry. Although she had acted flirtatiously, it was meant to work together with her spell so that she could deal with troublemakers. She did not expect the young man to be stiff like a piece of wood and not be mesmerized by her spell. The young man was not affected by her spell and instead easily overpowered her.</p><br/><p>Another thing that almost made Nedis faint was that the young man was taking advantage of her. He took out his sword and had lifted the hem of her robes. She was even more scared by the thought that the man had some freakish masochistic preferences...</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s large hand tightly gripped Nedis\u2019 two small hands at her back. Without showing any mercy, he swung the flat side of the Dragon Fang sword at her backside.</p><br/><p>A loud and crisp sound immediately echoed through the pub as a red mark appeared on Nedis\u2019 backside.</p><br/><p>Rody calmly hit her backside about a dozen times. Nedis could not help but cry out. Half of it was from the pain and the other half was from the shame.</p><br/><p>\"Do you still refuse to talk?\" Rody\u2019s voice was as cold as ice. He spoke as if the person in front of him was an enemy on the battlefield instead of a crying woman.</p><br/><p>\"I won\u2019t talk! I won\u2019t talk!\" Nedis cried out.</p><br/><p>\"Fine!\" Rody did not care and continued to hit her another dozen times. Nedis almost fainted from the pain and her backside had become swollen. Rody was very heavy-handed. He punished the woman according to the corporal punishment of the army.</p><br/><p>Finally, Nedis started to scream and when she could not struggle anymore she moaned. The soft sobs and cries somehow moved Rody. His hand involuntarily stopped hitting her.</p><br/><p>\"I will ask you again. Where are the people that fought my men and sneakily asked about the Duke\u2019s condition? This is a conspiracy. It is a crime for sheltering them! When my men fought with them earlier, your people also joined in! So you better not tell me that you don\u2019t know these people! I will always have a way to make you speak!\" Rody\u2019s tone of voice became gloomier as if he was not talking to a crying woman.</p><br/><p>Nedis gritted her teeth. Tears were still flowing down her face as she said, \"The things you do to me today, I will pay it back to you a hundredfold! There is nobody who dare to bully me, Nedis, in West Hill! Boy. Even if you are an Imperial Guard, don\u2019t think\u2026 Ah!\"</p><br/><p>Rody hit her again and then lifted her up like a sack and coldly said, \"If you do not speak, I have other ways to slowly punish you! There are no prisoners that would not open their mouths in front of me!\"</p><br/><p>Nedis was carried on his shoulder while her two thighs were held tightly. Another thing that almost made her faint was that one hand was touching her backside. She started to struggle again like a fish out of water.</p><br/><p>\"Stop struggling!\" Rody\u2019s following words made Nedis almost vomit blood. \"Are you afraid that I would take advantage of you? You are about as old as my aunt! I am not interested in old women!\"</p><br/><p>When Rody wanted to walk out, the middle-aged man tried to stop him and was kicked aside by Rody. The two soldiers also struggled to get up and follow Rody.</p><br/><p>The moment they left the pub, he softly ordered the two soldiers to run back to the barracks. He then calmly carried Nedis and walked leisurely in the opposite direction of the barracks.</p><br/><p>Nedis was almost dizzy from her anger. Her clothes were also too short. If she covered the top, she would not be able to cover the bottom. Rody carried her through the streets and they were surrounded by countless people who were pointing and laughing. The lewd laughter of the tramps was particularly unbearable. Nedis almost spat out blood and her teeth also almost cracked from gritting too hard.</p><br/><p>Rody walked faster and faster and finally turned a corner, entering a quiet and secluded road. This road looked quiet and there was nobody about. Nedis started to panic and her heart was beating really quickly. What is this boy trying to do by bringing me to a secluded place? This is not the way to the barracks\u2026 Could it be? Her heart was beating like a drum roll! Rody's earlier words that he had no interest in her had really infuriated her. Calling a woman \u2018aunt' would also make them crazy. Women are like that. It does not matter whether the woman was beautiful or not. They cannot afford to let others publicly demean them. Although Nedis was older than Rody, she was only slightly older. She still did not want to be called an \u2018aunt'.</p><br/><p>Even then Nedis was also afraid that Rody would do something to her. Rody noticed Nedis trembling and coldly said, \"Relax! I am not interested in you! I have carried you through a few streets. I presume your friends would soon catch up with us.\"</p><br/><p>The moment he said that he heard the voice of a boorish man. \"Release her!\"</p><br/><p>The moment Rody turned, he heard a piercing sound in the air and something with a strong energy flying towards his face.</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s eyes flashed as he grabbed the object. He felt something jerked powerfully in his hand as he caught a wolf fang arrow.</p><br/><p>The arrow was black and had a triangular arrowhead.</p><br/><p>Rody looked at the arrow and thought of something. He looked at the direction the arrow came from and saw a robust man on a rooftop a few dozen paces away.</p><br/><p>The man had a full beard and wore a gray robe. In his hands was a strange long bow.</p><br/><p>The man looked at Rody in surprise as he never expected Rody to catch the arrow. He nocked another arrow, pulled the bow until a full moon shape was formed and aimed it at Rody. However, before he could release the arrow, Rody loudly exclaimed. \"Darke!\"</p><br/><p>Darke was surprised to hear his name. He had never seen Rody\u2019s real face and could not recognize Rody. In his surprise, he let go of the bowstring, and the arrow shot out!</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s eyes lit up. This arrow was slower and he could even see the arrow's flight in the air... Darke was horrified when he saw the second arrow get caught. His eyes almost popped out!</p><br/><p>He roared, pulled out a sword from his waist and jumped from the roof... He had already seen the might of his opponent and knew that he was no match for him. However, Nedis was his friend. Now that his friend was captured he would try to rescue his friend.</p><br/><p>After he roared, he slashed downwards. Rody took the arrow he was shot with earlier to ward off the attack. There was a breaking sound as the arrow was chopped off but Rody took the advantage to step further back. He stood there calmly and smiled sincerely at Darke.</p><br/><p>\"Darke\u2026 It\u2019s me!\" Rody smiled. He ignored Darke\u2019s second slash.</p><br/><p>As Darke\u2019s sword came down, Darke heard Rody\u2019s next few words. The moment he heard these words, he stopped immediately.</p><br/><p>Rody said softly, \"Tulip Family's ten-year promise!\"</p><br/><p>Translator's Note:</p><br/><p>1.

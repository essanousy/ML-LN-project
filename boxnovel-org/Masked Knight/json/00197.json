It was only two streets away. In fact, that pub was frequented by the soldiers.</p><br/><p>Rody saw the sign from afar. His face sank from the first glance itself. It was not a good place to be. There were two large men that were obviously not good people standing at the entrance. Their clothes were bright and new but half of their hairy and tattooed chests were exposed. Their faces looked fierce.The only thing missing was a sign saying \u2018I am a bad guy\u2019. Most likely these people were workers doubling as fighters.</p><br/><p>Noises were audible through the solid door, mixed with the laughter and scolding of a woman and also the laughter and shouting of men.</p><br/><p>The two fighters saw Rody approach from afar. They then noticed the two soldiers behind Rody. One of the thugs gave a meaningful glance to the other and the second thug then went in.</p><br/><p>Rody had only brought two soldiers with him. With his current skills, he no longer needed to bring an entire group. With too many people around, it would be inconvenient for him to act.</p><br/><p>The soldier with the swollen eye whispered, \"This is the place. Those people standing at the entrance are people from the pub. They are obviously protecting that woman. After the few of us got beaten up, they threw us out. Besides that, the one on the left also kicked me!\"</p><br/><p>Rody did not speak. When he walked to the front of the pub, the thug blocked him and said, \"Sir. We are closed for the day and is not accepting any more guests. Please go to a different pub!\"</p><br/><p>Rody ignored the thug and continued to walk inside. He coldly replied, \"I am looking for someone.\" The thug stretched out his hands to block the way but suddenly, the thug then groaned loudly as he flew away and crashed through the door of the pub, breaking it into pieces. He landed inside the pub.</p><br/><p>The two soldiers behind Rody was surprised but then they heard Rody coldly say, \"Look carefully. No one has ever dared to fight against my troops. The two of you must be more spirited! Be more like a man!\"</p><br/><p>He kicked aside the broken wooden door and then strode right inside.</p><br/><p>The light in the pub was dim. There were a few people sitting at the tables that were scattered around the pub. Most of the guests were older men. Almost all the men were each cuddling a gorgeous woman with revealing attire.</p><br/><p>The man at the door that crashed in earlier had smashed a table into bits. He could not stand up and was lying there, looking at Rody. Everyone\u2019s attention was directed at the door.</p><br/><p>Rody walked in with large strides and looked at the surroundings. He could not help but frown. He then saw that at the central clear space of the pub a woman was still dancing, wearing even more revealing clothes that exposed her thighs and half her chest. Naturally, she stopped dancing and looked at Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody turned around and asked, \"You came to this place?\"</p><br/><p>The soldier replied, \"Yes\u2026 We just came here to have fun.\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head but he did not say anything. Rody did not like these kinds of thing but it was not a big problem. The soldiers were mostly men in the prime of their lives. They would feel bored staying in the barracks all day. So, it would be normal for them to go to these kinds of places to relax and burn off excess energy.</p><br/><p>After sighing deeply, Rody ignored the sharp looks of the onlookers and loudly asked, \"Who beat up my soldiers just now? Stand up!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" At this moment, all the women in the men's arms, as well as the dancer, reacted. The women jumped and screamed. They held onto their clothes that were in disarray as they ran to the back. When the women ran off the men could not do anything. The fun atmosphere was destroyed. They had only touched the thighs of the woman and were about to explore further... They then got extremely angry. Two men jumped up and cursed as they rushed at Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody did not spare them a single glance as he kicked them away. They flew and smashed onto a wooden platform. Some bottles of wine were also broken and the pub immediately reeked with a strong smell of alcohol.</p><br/><p>After that, there was a whistle and seven to eight people that looked like fighters charged in from the back. They all carried a sword each and the entire pub suddenly carried a murderous atmosphere.</p><br/><p>They were led by a middle-aged man who shouted, \"Which barracks are you from? How dare you come here and cause trouble! Don\u2019t you know what place this is?\"</p><br/><p>Rody coldly looked at him and said, \"You dare to fight against Imperial Guards! Hm\u2026 You even dare to carry weapons! The law of the Empire states that those who are not warriors or soldiers are not allowed to carry weapons! You truly have a lot of nerve!\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man no longer spoke and gave a meaningful glance to the others. Seven to eight thugs then rushed over while the surrounding guests jumped up, screamed and hid in a corner. Some who were too slow to run had crawled under the tables.</p><br/><p>There was screaming as the thugs were all easily defeated by Rody. They fell one after another from just a few simple waves of his hand. They groaned miserably and could no longer stand back up.</p><br/><p>He then looked at the ashen-faced middle-aged man and coldly asked, \"Are you the boss here? Where is the person who beat up my men earlier?\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was shocked. He looked at the young man in front of him and then at his own subordinates sprawled all over the ground. He trembled and could not say a single word. Rody was impatient. He lifted the man up after grabbing him by the collar and shouted, \"I asked you. Where is the one who fought against my men?\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man had eyes full of fear as he looked involuntarily at the narrow stairs near the walls of the pub. Rody hmphed and released the man. He then strode towards the stairs. The moment he reached the bottom of the stairs, he heard a soft and pleasant voice coming from above. \"Who is tearing up my place downstairs?\"</p><br/><p>Footsteps came from the stairs as a seductive figure walked down.</p><br/><p>Standing on top of the stairs, a girl was looking at Rody \u2014 more accurately, she was a woman. Her age could not be discerned from her appearance. She had a coquettish face and alluring eyes. Her eyes were peach colored and she had rosy lips. Her beautiful wavy hair hung down her head loosely with a lock draping over her eyes. She blinked lazily at Rody as if she had not fully woken up.</p><br/><p>A gown carelessly hung on her, loosely tied with a silk ribbon at her waist, with her well-endowed breasts half exposed. Looking at the two exposed snow-white hemispheres some would worry that the gown was too loose \u2014it might just slip off at any time.</p><br/><p>As she looked down \u2026</p><br/><p>Rody did not dare to look anymore!</p><br/><p>The robe was certainly large enough but it was too short! Her white and slender legs were exposed but not a trace of fat could be seen. Her thighs looked sturdy and captivating. The robe barely covered her thighs at all. Just by looking up a bit more, Rody could see her pink colored underwear.</p><br/><p>Rody was a young man. He quickly lowered his head as his murderous face turned a little red.</p><br/><p>As the woman walked down the stairs, her thighs swayed on the stairs. She slowly walked towards Rody. But as she slowly walked down her stairs, her robes opened up a little bit more. It seemed to slide and roll off her smooth and round ...</p><br/><p>She walked past Rody and glanced at Rody. She yawned lazily and said, \"Are you the one causing trouble here?\" Her voice was extremely gentle. It was a simple question. But it had the tone of an indulgent lover. It could melt anyone's heart...</p><br/><p>As if she was not demanding an answer from Rody, her hand stretched to the back of her head and grabbed her scattered hair. Then she took out a thin ribbon from somewhere and banded her hair \u2014 but there were no pockets anywhere on her...</p><br/><p>Her action of tying her hair attracted a lot of attention from the men. This action would make her naturally push her chest out such that the two towering full hemispheres in her chest would create a captivating deep cleavage in the middle.</p><br/><p>As if aware of the men\u2019s gaze, she pursed her lips and looked in disdain as she said, \"Men\u2026\" She then casually gathered her robes about her. Her actions caused the men to sigh with regret.</p><br/><p>\"Hey. You. Young man.\" The woman glanced flirtatiously at Rody and laughed lightly. \"Why are you causing trouble at my place?\"</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she looked for a chair to sit. She then crossed her legs, her white thighs looking very seductive in the dim light. Rody still did not dare to look up \u2014 from his position he could see the pink underwear in between her legs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

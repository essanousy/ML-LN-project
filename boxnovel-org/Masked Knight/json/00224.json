This made it difficult to believe that this was the place the Temple had dispatched the Saint to in the Sauron Kingdom for cultivation.</p><br/><p>Augustine followed the Black Veil Saint into the hall. After that, the door behind him was closed and the place became isolated from the eyes of the others outside the hall.</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint slowly turned to look at Augustine and whispered, \"Alright. Augustine, you can now tell me the purpose you came here.\"</p><br/><p>Augustine looked around and laughed, then he said, \"Mouse, don\u2019t you have a place to sit here?\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint looked unconcerned. She pointed at a stone platform and said, \"I cultivate there.\"</p><br/><p>Augustine walked over and stroked the cold stone platform. Suddenly, he sighed and said, \"Why do you do this? Nobody is blaming you. At the very least, we do not blame you. Even Fielding does not hate you. Why must you torture yourself?\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint remained unmoved and replied, \"Augustine, you are wrong. I never tortured myself. I lock myself up in here to become stronger. I did not feel apologetic for anyone\u2026Also\u2026\" She hesitated a little and then continued, \"This includes Fielding.\"</p><br/><p>Augustine frowned and said, \"Mouse, you have changed a lot! You did not use to be so cold in the past!\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint gave a mocking smile and said, \"In the past? Augustine, was the Temple like this last time?\" Without waiting for Augustine to speak, she continued, \"You are a Paladin of the Temple and a Commander of the Holy Knights. Let me ask you. What is the purpose of the Holy Knights?\"</p><br/><p>Augustine instinctively stood straight and proudly said, \"The existence of the Holy Knights is to protect the dignity and strength of the Temple! We fight for the Temple! We bleed for the Temple! Those who have the audacity to commit blasphemy against the Temple would first need to walk over the dead bodies of the Holy Knights!\"</p><br/><p>His deep voice echoed throughout the hall, filled with heroic pride. His eyes were also unusually steadfast.</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint shook her head. Her mocking smile grew wider. \"Augustine, you are talking about the past! What about now?\" She slowly approached Augustine and softly said, \"Why did the Temple want to wantonly expand the Holy Knights? Why must there be a dispatch of Holy Knights in every kingdom? Why did the Temple start a war that was as good as courting death? Why did they send eighty thousand loyal believers to the southern continent? Why is that Elder suddenly interested in the position of Pontiff at this moment? Why did all the kingdoms that were initially respectful to the Temple now become ferocious like tigers the moment the Temple is mentioned? Why did the Temple impose three additional taxes? Was the money earned by the devout believers from selling their last grain of rice being used to buy that sharp sword in your hands and that armor on your body?\"</p><br/><p>She did not speak impatiently or slowly. Each word was spoken unhurriedly and made Augustine speechless.</p><br/><p>It was true. Augustine could not answer a single question asked by the Black Veil Saint. Perhaps Augustine also had doubts. However, he was trained to be a loyal Holy Knight of the Temple since childhood. As a result, he instinctively forced himself not to doubt the Temple that he had faith in.</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint looked at Augustine\u2019s expression and asked a final string of questions, \"Also, how did five Paladins suddenly emerged in the Holy Knights? Is it really a miracle like what His Excellency had said? Did God really grant us powerful champions for the faithfuls of the Temple? Augustine, how much hard work does a person need to cultivate into a Paladin?\"</p><br/><p>Augustine was silent for a long time and finally gave a long sigh. He looked at the Black Veil Saint with a complicated expression and said, \"Mouse, you have really changed. You have become very indifferent. The Temple may have some irregularities right now. However, we have cultivated together in the Temple together during all those years. Your brothers and sisters are all fighting for the cause of the Temple. Are you just going to stay at the side and watch?\" He shook his head and continued, \"The Gray Robed Saint is dead and the God Slaying Bow is also lost. Fielding was defeated and you\u2026He does not seem like he would recover from this setback. He is no longer that brave and stalwart knight from those years! Right now, all the kingdoms are making preparations for war against the Temple. Can you still pretend and ignore this? The Temple has granted you the highest honor and extraordinary power. Can you abandon your faith in the Temple?\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint shouted in a stern voice, \"Enough!\" Anger appeared in her eyes as she said, \"I have never betrayed my faith!\" She then looked straight into Augustine\u2019s eyes and coldly said, \"What you said is correct. All the kingdoms are making war preparations. Their war against the Temple is inevitable! However, is this the will of God? Sounds more like the will of that Elder! God loves the people. God would not desire war amongst his devout people. If this war cannot be avoided, it is because it was forced onto the people of the Roland Continent by that Elder! Paladin Augustine! Let me ask you!\" Her gaze became sharper and colder as she said, \"As a proud Paladin, can you call dealing with the pious people of the Roland as \u2018defending the dignity of the Temple\u2019?\"</p><br/><p>Her indifferent voice echoed, \"The one betraying one\u2019s faith is not me but the Temple! If you continue to follow His Excellency\u2019s leadership, the Temple would gradually abandon their faith!\"</p><br/><p>\"Audacious!\" Augustine flew into a rage and shouted. He involuntarily held the hilt of his sword and a fierce aura emerged from his body. His gaze was like lightning as he glared at the Black Veil Saint. The Black Veil Saint did not look away. Instead, she looked at the angry golden armored Paladin in front of her. Her eyes were filled with ridicule.</p><br/><p>Both of them glared at each other for a long time. After that, Augustine gave a long sigh and loosened his grip on his sword. He lowered his head and softly asked, \"Mouse, what do you want? Do you want to publicly rebel against the Temple? Even if you are the Black Veil Saint, you will meet a bad end for rebelling against the Temple. You yourself know this!\" Augustine had a hesitant expression, but he softly whispered, \"Before I came here, the Elders were discussing you. Some of them could no longer put up with your current attitude. Some of them want to immediately recall you and imprison you. There are also some who want to strip the title of Saint from you and then execute you!\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint shook, feeling startled. However, she did not show any fear and coldly asked, \"Is that so? The one that proposed to have me executed. Is it the Chief Elder?\"</p><br/><p>Augustine shook his head and replied, \"No! On the contrary, he was the one who persisted in defending you! Mouse\u2026\" His tone grew soft and said, \"No matter what, you are the Temple\u2019s Black Veil Saint! You are a genius that appeared in the Temple after hundreds of years. You are also the only one amongst the twelve Saints who could obtain a Master level! No matter what, the Temple currently needs your support! Did you not think about it? It would be a huge blow to the Temple's prestige if a Saint of the Temple rebels.\"</p><br/><p>At this point, he hesitated and gritted his teeth, \"Mouse, if you are willing to come back and fight together with us, in the future\u2026I, Augustine, swear upon my knight\u2019s dignity that I would always stand by your side. Even if you take up position as an Elder, a Chief Elder, or even a Pontiff, I will still support you!\"</p><br/><p>A flash of disappointment crossed her eyes. The Black Veil Saint waited for Augustine to finish and then she whispered, \"Are you done? Augustine, you really disappoint me.\" Her beautiful eyes were filled with tears. \"Do you truly believe in your heart that I, Mouse, am someone who is greedy for power and influence? Do you also believe that I am rebelling against the Temple to fight for opportunities for a higher position and power?\"</p><br/><p>Augustine was shocked by the tears in her eyes and whispered, \"So\u2026sorry.\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint took a deep breath and said, \"I have already thought enough. I will not rebel against the Temple. If that does not work out, I will quietly leave.\"</p><br/><p>\"Leave?\" Augustine anxiously asked, \"Where will you go? As long as you are in the Roland Continent, you cannot escape the Temple! Are you\u2026\" His sturdy body trembled. \"Do you intend to go to the Radiant Continent? Are you going to look for the Duke of the Tulip Family?\"</p><br/><p>There was a warm smile in the eyes of the Black Veil Saint. Her gaze seemed to drift away as she muttered, \"I do not know. Maybe I will, maybe I won\u2019t. I just hope he is doing well there.\"</p><br/><p>Augustine\u2019s expression became even more unsightly as he said, \"So, Fielding\u2019s words were true? You fell in love with a heathen? You fell in love with a demonic and blasphemous butcher whose hands are stained with the blood of the Roland people?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is not a demon! He is also not a butcher!\" The Black Veil Saint shouted. Her eyes turned ice cold again as she said, \"If there is anybody in this world that could understand me, it is that person!\"</p><br/><p>Augustine took a step back. His voice turned hoarse and he had a helpless expression. \"Mouse, you are crazy!\"</p><br/><p>\"I am not crazy!\" The Black Veil Saint shook her head. \"The one who is crazy is that Elder, the Temple, and also you, Augustine! You are all daydreaming! You are all dreaming of the Temple conquering the world like hundreds of years ago! All of you thought of going back to the age where the continent is ruled by the dictatorship of one Pontiff!\"</p><br/><p>Augustine clenched his fists and lowered his head. When he raised his head again, his expression had turned cold and devoid of any expression.</p><br/><p>\"Your Excellency Mouse!\" His voice sounded indifferent, \"I, Augustine, Paladin of the Temple, received orders from the Elders Council of the Temple! King Sauron of the Sauron Kingdom is secretly plotting with the heathens of the Radiant Continent. I am ordered to kill the envoy of the Radiant Continent. As the Saint of the Sauron Kingdom, Your Excellency Mouse, I order you to help me!\"</p><br/><p>He gave the Black Veil Saint a profound look and said in a low voice, \"Before coming here, I have received news that the Paladin Amore Hughes that had been ordered to intercept them has failed! Twenty-four sorcerers, three warships, five hundred and sixty well-known sailors and one hundred knights were dispatched with Amore Hughes. Not a single one of them returned!\"</p><br/><p>He looked at the Black Veil Saint\u2019s indifferent expression. Augustine took a deep breath. He said in a cold tone, \"The Chief Elder had also given me another secret order! Your Excellency Mouse! If you continue to defy us, I am ordered to execute you on the spot! His Excellency means that if you are willing to cooperate with the Temple one last time, he would allow you to \u2018leave peacefully\u2019!\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint stared at Augustine\u2019s face and sneered, \"Really? Execute me on the spot? Augustine. Do you really think you can kill me? Also, what does he mean by \u2018leave peacefully\u2019?\"</p><br/><p>Augustine looked down to the sword on his waist. \"Mouse, do not force my hand. At this distance, I have absolute certainty that I can kill you. You also know that I would have ways to kill you even if you are a Great Practitioner!\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint gave an unusual expression and said, \"I know.\" Her tone gradually became calmer as she said, \"Augustine, I was the youngest amongst the people cultivating at the Temple. You cared for me and I would always remember it. I have also never told anyone about your secret.\"</p><br/><p>Augustine laughed bitterly and said, \"Thank you. Thank you for keeping my secret and not despising me for my cowardice.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, you are not a coward!\" The Black Veil Saint shook her head and sighed, \"That preposterous outdated rule was totally illogical.\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint suddenly smiled and said, \"Well then. If you want to kill me, then do it.\"</p><br/><p>Augustine\u2019s expression changed as he took a step back and said, \"You seriously intend to break away now?\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint\u2019s hand trembled. \"I understand. If you cannot complete your order and report back, that Elder would not let you off. Augustine, you are too honest! Do you ever wonder why the Elder dispatched you here instead of the other Paladins? Do you ever wonder why the Temple suddenly has more Paladins? Fielding was sent to the battlefield on the southern continent deliberately to let him die. Do you still not understand this? What that Elder wants is a change. You, Fielding, and I are not included in his plans!\"</p><br/><p>Augustine turned pale as he thought, 'It is a purge!'</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint laughed bitterly and continued, \"If I did not guess incorrectly, the new Paladins are all that Elder\u2019s trusted subordinates? Just now you said about intercepting at sea. Did you know about it beforehand? Why was a Paladin and the Holy Knights mobilized but kept secret from the Commander of the Holy Knights?\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint slowed down her speech when she saw Augustine speechless. \"Augustine, let me ask you this. Right now, you are loyal to the Temple. However, when that Elder becomes a Pontiff and if he orders you to kill the pious believers of God, will you accept the order without hesitation? Will you continue to maintain your loyalty? You must know that if there is a war, blood will flow. The soldiers of the kingdoms and even the civilians are all innocent believers of God! They just do not want to be dictated by a Pontiff! However, you cannot say that they have betrayed God!\"</p><br/><p>She continued to stand in front of the Paladin and asked, \"Paladin Augustine! If a day comes when such an \u2018enemy\u2019 is right in front of you, will you be willing to kill?\"</p><br/><p>Augustine was speechless. He was really unable to give a reply.</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint sighed, \"That Elder is smarter than both of us! If I can think of this, he would have thought of this long ago! Do you think he would allow a disobedient and popular Paladin in the army to live?\"</p><br/><p>The Paladin trembled slightly and showed a pained expression. His glare gradually became as sharp as a blade as he gritted his teeth, \"Mouse! Perhaps you may be right. However, until that day comes, I will not betray the Temple! Now, prepare for battle!\" He took a deep breath and said, \"Do not worry. If that day really comes, I will be fair to you! Even if I will be executed, I will kill the culprit first! But right now, your words cannot convince me!\"</p><br/><p>He slowly pulled out his sword and pointed it towards the ground. His stalwart figure was like a rock that existed since ancient times. He was ice-cold and unshakeable.</p><br/><p>He asked in a murderous tone. \"Mouse, I will ask you one last time. Are you unwilling to compromise?\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint calmly replied, \"Augustine, you do not have to ask! That Elder knows I will not compromise which is why he sent you here to take my life!\"</p><br/><p>Augustine gritted his teeth and said, \"Fine! The esteemed Elder of the Temple has given a secret order. The Black Veil Saint is guilty of betraying the Temple and will be executed. The six people who manage the Sauron Kingdom\u2019s Temple and the four Holy Knights are also guilty of the same crime and will be executed together!\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" The Black Veil Saint exclaimed. \"They will be executed as well?\" She shouted, \"Augustine! They do not have any intentions of betraying the Temple. Why should they be executed?\"</p><br/><p>Augustine gritted his teeth and replied, \"I don\u2019t care! I only receive orders to kill! Whether or not they are guilty is for the Elder Council to decide!\"</p><br/><p>The man who was reputed to be the oldest and strongest Paladin of the Roland Continent swung out his sword like lightning. The sharp edge of the sword shined brilliantly.</p><br/><p>The silence in the hall was broken. A magnificent red flash rose as blood spilled onto the cold floor.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>In the forest that was a few kilometers away from the Sauron Kingdom\u2019s Temple, three black-robed knights were sitting on three black horses. The moonlight shined between the gaps of the robe and revealed a golden brilliance. A gold-colored spear hanged on each of the horses.</p><br/><p>The three horses quietly stood there in a triangular formation. The man on the left suddenly took a deep breath and said, \"The sky is turning bright.\"</p><br/><p>The man in front turned around and asked, \"What\u2019s wrong?\"</p><br/><p>The man on the left replied, \"I only said that the sky is turning bright. I do not like the air here. It is hot and damp. Only the cold breeze before dawn allows me to recall my hometown.\"</p><br/><p>The man in front heard this and could not help but take a deep breath. He slowly said, \"Yes, I don't like the weather here too. It makes me miss my snowy hometown, especially the freezing cold on the summit of the mountains.\" He suddenly turned the other way to look at the man on the right and asked, \"What about you? What are you thinking of?\"</p><br/><p>The face of the man on the right was hidden by a huge black cloak but a pair of yellow eyes was visible. His voice sounded metallic and rhythmic as he said, \"I was just thinking. Would that fellow Augustine be able to become ruthless if the Black Veil Saint still refuses to compromise? I heard that humans are full of emotions.\"</p><br/><p>The man in front nodded and replied, \"We do not need to think about this! If he does not act, then we will! We will just kill both of them together! Hmph. One of them is a Great Practitioner, the other one is a Paladin. I am really curious. They are the so-called strongest amongst the humans but how powerful are they? Especially Augustine. That guy looks really strong!\"</p><br/><p>The man on the right seemed to hesitate a little and said, \"There is no news of Amore Hughes. I really suspect that he encountered a mishap. However, I feel even more skeptical. Is there really a human that could be strong enough to kill him?\"</p><br/><p>The man in front hmphed and said, \"Do not talk about that useless-bum Amore Hughes. Even if he can return alive, I will personally kill him! He is a shame to our race!\" His tone of voice gradually became thicker as he continued, \"To be defeated by a human! Such a shameful Dragon warrior does not need to exist!\"</p><br/><p>The man on the left was indifferent as he looked towards the horizon in the East. He then sighed feeling depressed and said somewhat angrily, \"Sigh. That damn sun has risen. The sky has turned bright again!\"</p><br/><p>The sun rose from the East and shined brilliantly onto the earth. The morning sun shined onto the three men and their long shadows fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>The man in front turned around and smiled, \"Alright. I know. An Snow Dragon like you hates this warm climate.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

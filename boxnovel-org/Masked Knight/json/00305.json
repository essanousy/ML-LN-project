She saw the lightning hit the distant mountain and the rocks at the edge of the mountain collapse. Dust flew everywhere.</p><br/><p>\"Red Cloth, I did not expect you to have mastered this forbidden spell!\" Mouse gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>\"Black Veil, if you still have any words to say, save it for when I catch you and bring you to the court of judgment!\"</p><br/><p>Mouse sneered and replied, \"Hmph. Red Cloth, did you think you could defeat me with just a forbidden spell?\"</p><br/><p>Her expression became even colder. As though the thunder in the sky reflected her mood, the bolts of lightning in the sky grew more intense and seemingly shot out of the clouds.</p><br/><p>\"In accordance with God\u2019s command, we are bringing the blasphemous person to the Supreme Judgement\u2026\" The Red Clothed Saint\u2019s voice seemed to sound like chanting a scripture. His expression became more and more solemn. His voice echoed in the sky as he said, \"God declared that we are benevolent. So, all sinners are to be returned to him in the Supreme Judgement.\"</p><br/><p>As soon as he said that, he tapped the huge mirror-like disc. There was then a loud clanging sound that seemed to have an effect that of a solid wave, scattering a lot of the dark clouds.</p><br/><p>\"Black Veil, accept the Supreme Judgement of the Gods!\" The Red Clothed Saint sneered. \"You may be more powerful than me but in the face of Supreme Judgement, even your most powerful tactics would be sent back to you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\" Mouse sneered. \"It is just a mirror. Watch me break it!\"</p><br/><p>Her slender fingers moved very quickly. There was a concentrated thunderous sound. The clouds in the sky dropped another four lightning bolts at the Red Clothed Saint.</p><br/><p>The Red Clothed Saint shouted out and hid behind the mirror. The lightning bolts struck the mirror then there was a golden light. The Red Clothed Saint\u2019s expression fiercely twisted a little, as though using that sorcery was strenuous. However, soon after that, the Supreme Judgement once again sent the lightning back to Mouse.</p><br/><p>Mouse sneered. Her finger gave a command and the clouds in the sky dropped a few lightning bolts, striking the deflected lightning bolts and causing it to disperse.</p><br/><p>\"Red Cloth!\" Mouse\u2019s beautiful face was ice-cold. \"I have already said this earlier. Your Supreme Judgement is just a laughable sorcery trick\u2026Hmph. Let us see how long your magic power can last.\"</p><br/><p>Mouse then spun her body in place. Countless lightning bolts dropped from the sky and struck the Supreme Judgement mirror.</p><br/><p>The Red Clothed Saint seemed to shake. The rapid consumption of magic power made him turn pale. However, the mirror still reflected all the lightning.</p><br/><p>Mouse did not stop at all. Lightning bolts continued to shoot from the sky and struck down the reflected lightning bolts, while the remaining ones continued to bombard the Red Clothed Saint\u2019s Supreme Judgement.</p><br/><p>Finally, there was a clear and melodious cracking sound. The Red Clothed Saint flinched and quickly let go of the mirror as he retreated.</p><br/><p>The edge of the Supreme Judgement immediately started to crack. Countless thin cracks appeared on the originally smooth mirror. Finally, the mirror broke then disappeared like fireworks...</p><br/><p>Mouse sneered as she stopped. She looked murderously at her opponent and asked, \"Red Cloth, what else do you have?\"</p><br/><p>The Red Clothed Saint had retreated quickly. However, his pale face revealed a smug smile.</p><br/><p>She soon saw a few sorcerers from the Temple had prepared a strange and skewed hexagram in the sky. The Red Clothed Saint had retreated to the center of the hexagram.</p><br/><p>\"Black Veil, you are just a woman. In the final analysis, you are still not a match for me!\" The Red Clothed Saint suddenly stopped laughing and shouted, \"Die! Black Veil!\"</p><br/><p>The old sorcerer, Sith, had already retreated to the rear. When Mouse and the Red Clothed Saint fought, he had tried to attack a few of the other sorcerers. However, they successfully defended their positions and had used some kind of sorcery array. At the periphery, there was a Guardian Boundary blocking Sith\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Sith also did not try his best. His task was to take advantage of the chaos to attack Rody. It was not to fight desperately against the Temple.</p><br/><p>\"Something is not right!\" Sith warned Mouse and had quickly descended. He conveniently threw a fireball down. The dragon warriors attacking Mark was knocked back, and he then headed towards Rody.</p><br/><p>The hexagram made by the Temple\u2019s sorcerers quickly emitted a white light. The white light gathered at the Red Clothed Saint in the center, as though he was standing in the middle of a holy light giving him a God-like aura.</p><br/><p>\"The holy light will cleanse the evil of the world. Be enlightened, Black Veil!\" The soft voice of the Red Clothed Saint was heard. Mouse immediately felt everything in front of her had turned bright.</p><br/><p>A huge beam of light enveloped Mouse. She could not dodge it even with her strength. Her entire body was shrouded in that beam of light.</p><br/><p>At the start, Mouse closed her eyes subconsciously to avoid the glare. However, when she reopened her eyes, she noticed that her body did not suffer any injury. Although the light was intense, she felt warm as though the afternoon sun was shining on her body.</p><br/><p>But then, Mouse\u2019s expression immediately changed. This was because she felt her magic power rapidly being pulled out of her body.</p><br/><p>She raised her eyebrows and quickly moved to the left. However, when her body hit the edge of the beam of light, she actually bounced back!</p><br/><p>Mouse gradually felt weak...</p><br/><p>The magic power in her body started to flow out faster and faster. Finally, it was like a powerful current. Mouse bit her lips in pain. At that moment, her body felt a weird pain.</p><br/><p>Inside her body, the movement of magic power pierced through her soul with an ice-cold feeling. However, her skin that was illuminated by the beam of light felt warm and cozy. She felt as though her soul was being torn apart by two large hands.</p><br/><p>She suddenly opened her mouth and uttered a pained scream...</p><br/><p>At that moment, the beam of light had something indiscernible appeared like flowing water. It was like the flow of energy pulled out of Mouse\u2019s body that slowly moved towards the Red Clothed Saint. It then gradually entered the Red Clothed Saint\u2019s body...</p><br/><p>Sith had secretly approached Rody. However, the huge changes to the situation in the sky caused him to pause instinctively. He took a look and shouted aloud without thinking, \"Combined sorcery! It is the Temple\u2019s combined sorcery!\"</p><br/><p>Rody had just been sneakily attacked by a dragon warrior behind him. He staggered a little and knelt on one knee barely able to support his body with his scimitar. His entire body felt painful. The power in his body seemed to have dried up.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he heard Mouse\u2019s voice in the sky...</p><br/><p>Her scream was filled with pain, fear, and sorrow...</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s mind then hummed as though something from inside his body charged into his mind. It seemed something like a stick in his mind broke...</p><br/><p>\"Mou\u2026Mouse\u2026\" Rody involuntarily looked towards the sky. The situation in the sky had made the weak-looking Rody instantly appear incomparably angry. He suddenly roared loudly, \"Mouse!\"</p><br/><p>In an instant, Rody\u2019s body burst out with his golden fighting energy. His eyes looked extremely murderous. His large body suddenly stood back up. His scimitar carried a golden flame...</p><br/><p>Swish! Swish! Without even having the opportunity to give a horrified shriek, the few dragon warriors near him had instantly been split into two. Their broken corpses fell to the ground, forming a river of blood.</p><br/><p>Rody roared. He saw the beam of light in the sky finally dispersed. Mouse\u2019s body was like a fragile leaf as she fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>Rody fiercely stomped his foot into the ground, creating a deep imprint, and propelled body into the air like an arrow. He caught Mouse in the air and then crashed to the ground.</p><br/><p>Mouse\u2019s eyes were tightly closed. Her breathing was very weak, and she looked very pale.</p><br/><p>There was a long and haughty laugh in the sky. The pale-faced Red Clothed Saint now looked as rosy as his clothes. He again magically took out a huge mirror, pointing it to the people on the ground and shouted, \"All you sinners, accept God\u2019s Judgement!\"</p><br/><p>The sorcerors of the hexagram once again started to send out wisps of holy light that flowed towards the Red Clothed Saint.</p><br/><p>As the light accumulated in his body, his body once again shined with a dazzling white light.</p><br/><p>\"Run quickly!\" Sith\u2019s expression changed as he quickly escaped.</p><br/><p>Arslan and Ruolan were in a situation where both sides had suffered injuries. Arslan had the strength of a dragon warrior. During the fight, she had used fire and ice, causing a lot of damage to Ruolan. At that moment, half of Ruolan\u2019s armor was covered in ice with the other half being burnt black.</p><br/><p>Arslan had also suffered a lot of injuries. Blood flowed from her mouth. Her movements have also slowed down a lot.</p><br/><p>Ruolan\u2019s specialty was power. She had used her overwhelming strength to suppress her opponent. This kind of adversary was the perfect nemesis of Arslan. In the battle just now, both of them had suffered substantial injuries.</p><br/><p>Arslan had long been aware of the situation in the sky. She quickly retreated and shouted in the dragon\u2019s language.</p><br/><p>Countless roars were then heard. All the attacking dragon warriors suddenly howled in strange voices...</p><br/><p>Their bodies suddenly expanded. Their body armors burst open.</p><br/><p>Within a moment, all the dragon warriors transformed into dragons of different sizes. These dragons did not continue to attack Old Mark. Their dragon wings flapped rapidly as hundreds of dragons retreated towards Arslan.</p><br/><p>The frightened Sith roared loudly, \"Everyone! Disperse!\"</p><br/><p>As if following his words, a huge beam of light shot down from the sky.</p><br/><p>The huge mirror in the Red Clothed Saint\u2019s hand caused the beam of light to be magnified by more than ten times.</p><br/><p>Hearing Sith\u2019s warning shouts, Ruolan moved immediately. Old Mark was also fast. However, the light was too quick even for people who were as strong as Paladins to escape.</p><br/><p>Old Mark was apparently far agiler than Ruolan. He had already tried to jump out from the beam of light. However, just in that moment, he suddenly felt his body turn cold and his body stiff in the air, as if a large chunk of his soul was cut out. The indescribable feeling of pain distorted his old face.</p><br/><p>However, he still managed to jump out of the light. Although he had crashed heavily to the ground, he had escaped.</p><br/><p>The beam had been magnified ten times by the mirror. It was as though the speed at which it extracted energy also became ten times faster.</p><br/><p>Ruolan was not so lucky. When her body crashed heavily into the edge of the beam, she bounced back. As the beam of light shined on her body, she quickly lost the ability to stand. She slashed out with her sword. However, the beam of light was like a solid object. When her sword reached the edge of the light, it was stopped!</p><br/><p>Ruolan soon lost the energy to even curse and her huge body crashed into the ground.</p><br/><p>The only one that had not been hurt was Rody.</p><br/><p>He held on to Mouse as he knelt. His body and mind had all been focused on Mouse. His large hand caressed Mouse\u2019s face as he called her name, \"Mouse\u2026Mouse\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Mouse\u2019s eyelids trembled slightly and opened a little. She could not see clearly but she knew who was in front of her from the familiar aura.</p><br/><p>Mouse\u2019s lips had lost its color. Her lips fluttered softly as though she was saying something. However, she was so weak that she could hardly say a complete sentence.</p><br/><p>Rody suppressed the anger in his heart and tilted his head down to listen to her.</p><br/><p>\"Rody\u2026run\u2026run quickly\u2026We\u2026cannot win. That Red\u2026 Red\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody trembled. He seemed to find it difficult to suppress the murderous rage in his heart. He seemingly had a desire to tear things apart. However, the powerful Black Veil Saint in his arms was like a delicate glass.</p><br/><p>\"Mouse, are you talking about that Red Clothed Saint?\" Rody gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>Sith stood not far from Rody and whispered, \"She will not die. It is just that sorcery had sucked away all her magic powers. Right now, she is very weak.\"</p><br/><p>Rody felt that his heart was about to explode. He gently carried Mouse and laid her by Sith\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>His eyes were filled with a mixture of ice and fire. He coldly said towards the old sorcerer, \"Look after her. I am going to kill that red-clothed fellow!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

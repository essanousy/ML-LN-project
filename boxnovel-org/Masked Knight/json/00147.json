He then shook his head and took out a bottle of wine. He took a big gulp and sighed in satisfaction. He looked at the sky outside and muttered, \u201cHow come the sky is so dark at this hour? Hm, I will meet that boy Rody tomorrow. He is probably feeling extremely anxious right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his smile disappeared. His lazy expression had turned pale as he threw away the bottle of wine. He rushed out of the stable and faced the east with his eyes closed.</p><br/><p>Old Mark\u2019s forehead was soaked in cold sweat. \u201cThis\u2026 This aura\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the Imperial Palace, Master Autumn slowly sat on a wooden bench. In front of him was his long and narrow sword. The dazzling sword reflected Master Autumn\u2019s icy cold expression. Master Autumn\u2019s white hair hung across his shoulders, and he looked as calm as a rock.</p><br/><p>Similarly, he opened his eyes and gave a strange look.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis aura\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Church's Religious Center represented the apex of the Church's powers and was also the heart of the Church's domain. But the building itself was simple and crude.</p><br/><p>It was a beautiful building with a spacious hall without any decorations. In front of the hall was a tall statue. The statue of God was cold and majestic as if to highlight the fact that they were the spokesmen for God. Sitting in front of the statue was the Radiant Empire\u2019s religious leader, the Pope. He looked equally dignified and aloof.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a simple and spotless white robe. However, he projected a holy and dignified manner. He opened his eyes and looked at the four religious elders beside him. After that, he slowly asked, \u201cCan you all feel it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Pope\u2026 We can feel it as well. It feels like\u2026 a dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Pope, Corsica VI, gave a smile, but his smile felt oppressive. He then slowly said, \u201cDragons usually live on the Northern Continent. How did one appear inside the Radiant Continent? On top of that, how did it appear in the Imperial Capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>The four elders remained silent.</p><br/><p>Corsica VI shook his head lightly and said, \u201cElder Roma. Please go outside the city and see what is happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black robed elder sitting furthest to the right stood up and bowed to the Pope. He then said in a soft voice, \u201cThis one abides by Your Majesty\u2019s instructions in the name of the Almighty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Roma placed both hands at his chest. He then closed his eyes and was covered in light. After that, he had completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>Corsica VI sighed. He slowly stood up and looked at the statue of God. He then muttered, \u201cIs that really a dragon?\u201d.</p><br/><p>Sophie continued to step back. She started to feel even more scared from the imposing aura of the Duke of the Tulip Family.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody looked indifferently at the mask in his hands and then glanced at Sophie. \u201cAre you talking about my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody stretched out the other hand and clenched his fist. Sophie suddenly screamed as her body flew towards Rody. Rody then gripped her neck tightly and lifted her body.</p><br/><p>The vampire was two meters tall. However, she was being lifted by the shorter and smaller sized Rody. As Rody held her neck, Sophie\u2019s body turned stiff and trembled. However, she was unable to use her strength while the other party was gripping her neck.</p><br/><p>Rody held Sophie with one hand without bothering to look at her. His eyes focused on the mask in his other hand. He looked at a loss and had a strange expression.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Rody showed a trace of emotion.</p><br/><p>He slowly said, \u201cI remember. I am me \u2026 I am Rody!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s cold face then revealed a calm smile. The silver mask in his hand disappeared. Finally, Rody lifted his face to look at the vampire in his grip. Sophie was unable to breathe and had almost fainted. Her pair of claws felt powerless as her feet flailed about softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me\u2026 Can you resurrect her? I know those that were killed by your clan can be reborn in some other way.\u201d Rody spoke calmly and indifferently. It was as if he was just making a simple request.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Sophie trembled but was unable to speak.</p><br/><p>Rody laughed coldly. But his laughter seemed to have an evil tone to it.</p><br/><p>Sophie felt the grip on her neck loosen, and she was finally able to breathe. She immediately said, \u201cShe\u2026 she did not die from me sucking her blood. I\u2026 We, vampires, can only resurrect those that we have killed that way. She\u2026 is not\u2026\u201d Her reply tumbled out due to the overwhelming fear.</p><br/><p>Rody nodded slowly and lightly replied. \u201cIn other words, you are unable to resurrect her. Is that right? Also, she could not even be resurrected as a vampire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sophie felt the grip on the neck started to tighten again, and she immediately shouted in fear, \u201cNo, no, no... There are other ways. Unless\u2026 unless \u2026 unless...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d Rody laughed indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless\u2026 the blood of the Gods is used. God\u2019s blood can resurrect thousands of lives\u2026 She can be resurrected with God\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody nodded his head and closed his eyes. After thinking for a while, he laughed and said, \u201cSo that's the way. God's blood will do it. Is that correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d Sophie shouted in desperation.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Rody sighed. \u201cThat means you are no longer needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gripped Sophie\u2019s neck tightly again. The vampire\u2019s neck started to crack loudly as she gave a blood-curdling scream.</p><br/><p>Rody smiled like a cold-blooded butcher. His other hand knocked on his head, and he said, \u201cI do not know what just happened\u2026 but I feel like my head is giving me strange thoughts\u2026 I also seem to come from a strange place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was terribly calm as he continued. \u201cThat place\u2026 It seems to be called\u2026 hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody then laughed softly. His eyes changed color and said, \u201cDo you know what is in hell? Let me tell you. It is fire! It is Hell Fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said that, Rody grabbed Sophie\u2019s neck and started to emit a steady flame from his hand. The fire was completely black. It spread from Rody\u2019s hand and gradually burned the vampire.</p><br/><p>Amidst the sizzling sound of burning tissues, Sophie screamed tragically. She screamed as if her soul was also burning. It was the kind of pain that destroyed the soul.</p><br/><p>As Sophie screamed, Rody was laughing. He laughed so loud that his body trembled involuntarily. The vampire in his hand started to melt from the black flames and soon burned to ashes.</p><br/><p>Finally, the black dust in his hands dispersed. Rody slowly lowered his hands as he looked at the ashes floating in mid-air. His expression finally began to calm down.</p><br/><p>The black flames surrounding his body vanished, and everything returned to normal. Rody then walked to Jojo\u2019s side. He knelt on one knee and stroked her face. He then tidied up her beautiful hair.</p><br/><p>Jojo\u2019s eyes were finally closed. Her face was extremely calm as if it was satisfied and at peace. The pitiful girl did not know that she had sacrificed her life for someone she did not love. She died thinking that she would die with her beloved.</p><br/><p>Tears fell from Rody\u2019s eyes. He shook his head and gently stroked Jojo\u2019s chest. The wound that Rody placed his hand at healed rapidly.</p><br/><p>Finally, Rody took another look at Jojo\u2019s now intact body. He then stood up and murmured, \u201cYou may not have loved me, but you still died because of me.\u201d Rody closed his eyes and said, \u201cWas it God\u2019s blood? In that case, I will use God\u2019s blood to resurrect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then lifted Jojo\u2019s body with one hand and raised his other hand gradually, with the palm facing down.</p><br/><p>Black flames came out from his hand. All the signs of the massacre were burned to ashes including the carriage, the horse, and the loyal guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is fine\u2026 ashes to ashes, dust to dust.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody sighed and shook his head. He heard a strange voice shouting in his mind. It sounded like a magic chant that was pulling away his soul.</p><br/><p>Just as he was ready to leave, a white and holy light appeared behind him. The light then disappeared to reveal an old man with black robes. The old man held a long staff. His face looked like dried tangerines and was full of wrinkles.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere\u2026\u201d The old man looked around and finally rested his eyes on Rody. He then asked, \u201cThat strong aura earlier. Was that yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody turned around and frowned at the old man that had suddenly appeared. \u201cGet lost. My mood right now is terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Rody turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>The old man then raised his staff and shot a white light towards Rody.</p><br/><p>A large wall of light then appeared in front of Rody to block his way.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me! Who are you? Are you the one that emitted that aura? What happened here?\u201d The old man\u2019s face suddenly wrinkled even more as he said, \u201cNo! I smell a vampire\u2019s aura!\u201d His expression then changed as he asked, \u201cWhat are you? Are you a vampire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody stretched his hand and gently touched the wall of light that obstructed him. At first, his hand was stopped by the wall of light, but his hand soon broke through the wall easily.</p><br/><p>Rody smiled. \u201cA light spell\u2026 Hmm, it seems to only be at a low level\u2026\u201d Rody then stopped and mumbled to himself. \u201cStrange. How do I know all these?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-robed old man watched in horror as Rody easily broke through his wall of light. He asked again, \u201cYou! What are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and turned around to look at the old man hatefully. \u201cMy mood right now is terrible. Do not disturb me. If you try and stop me again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man trembled violently. Just from hearing the last few words of the other party, his heart felt cold.</p><br/><p>He calmed himself and remembered the Pope\u2019s instruction. He then took a deep breath and had a strange thought. Bullshit! I am one of the most respected Elders of the Church!</p><br/><p>The old man gently placed his staff on the floor and spoke in a very solemn voice, \u201cI am one of the most respectable Bishop of the God's Church, Elder Roma! I ask you in the name of the Pope! Are you the one that exuded that earlier aura?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody that had originally intended to walk away suddenly stopped when he heard the word \u2018God\u2019 He turned around and looked at Elder Roma with a delighted smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you one of the Elders at the Church?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roma did not know why the other party was laughing. However, when Roma saw that smile, he tensed up a little and exhaled. He then slowly said, \u201cYes. I am one of the most respected Bishops of the Church. I ask you. What are you? Are you a vampire?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard the word \u2018vampire\u2019, a queer color flashed in his eyes for an instant. He then shook his head and replied, \u201cI am not a vampire\u2026 I am\u2026\u201d Rody then gave a wry smile and continued, \u201cI also do not know what I am right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, was that aura earlier yours?\u201d Roma\u2019s voice became deeper as he continued to ask. \u201cAre you a dragon or a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody again shook his head lightly and replied, \u201cI already said that I do not know\u2026 I do not know what I am right now\u2026 It is probably\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d Rody then gave a cold smile and said, \u201c\u2026 I am probably a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Roma could continue to speak, Rody slowly walked towards him and gave a strange smile. He then slowly said, \u201cSince you are one of the Elders of God's religion, I have a question that you might be able to answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d Roma looked at the other party approaching him and started to become vigilant.</p><br/><p>Rody laughed as if he was happy, but his voice sounded cold. \u201cI want to know how to obtain the blood of the so-called God that you believe in.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

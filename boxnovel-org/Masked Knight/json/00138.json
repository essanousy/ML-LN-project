Come out, quickly!\u201d Sky spoke lazily.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill don't want to come out? If you do not come out, I will not be polite anymore! Do you think I can\u2019t catch a small bat?\u201d Sky pursed his lips and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will count to three! One!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo! You still don't want to come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally don\u2019t want to come out? Alright! Three!\u201d Sky stood up, and he was becoming impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you anxious?\u201d A clear voice sounded from the depth of the woods. \u201cGoing for a walk on such a beautiful night is truly pleasant.\u201d</p><br/><p>A tall and slim figure appeared from behind the trees. He was wrapped in a long black cloak. His face looked delicate and pale like a sickly person. When the moon shined on him, there was a very long shadow. He looked very relaxed and comfortable under the moonlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be grateful to me. If I did not bring you so far away, how could you enjoy such a beautiful night scene?\u201d He gently smiled.</p><br/><p>Sky shook his head and replied, \u201cForget it. How far have you taken me? How long was it? We have run for more than a hundred miles. Where is there such a walk? At first, I was quite interested in toying with you. However, now... I am getting impatient.\u201d Sky waved his hand and continued, \u201cCome on, after dealing with you, I am going back to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man gently shook his head and lightly said, \u201cDealt with me? Sigh. You... It is such a beautiful and elegant night, you must not utter such murderous words... Look...\u201d The man stretched out one of his pale and almost transparent fingers. \u201cLook at those flowers, they are so afraid of your murderous aura that they wilted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky was not agitated at all but instead waited for the other party to finish talking nonsense. He then laughed, \u201cYou, little bat. Didn\u2019t you bring me in circles, the whole night, to draw me away? Now that I have already accompanied you for the entire night, you would no longer be able to escape even if you could fly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that so\u2026\u201d The man laughed, \u201cYou knew I was drawing you away from your companions! Aren\u2019t you worried that our people would hurt them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky froze for a moment and then he laughed. \u201cHahahaha...\u201d</p><br/><p>That man frowned and asked, \u201cIs it very funny? Fatty, it is really rude to laugh at others like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky continued to laugh loudly and then asked, \u201cDo you really think that the few of you could hurt that boy?\u201d</p><br/><p>That man shrugged his shoulders and answered, \u201cIsn't it so? He is just an ordinary mortal. Even if he is a high ranked warrior, so what? It is currently night time, and the night is our world...\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky shook his head. \u201cWrong! You are wrong! Do you think that I am so stupid to just follow you running around? Let me tell you. I am extremely confident of that boy. Not to say only a few of you, small bats... even if the old bat was here, he could not even hope to injure that boy. Now even I do not have the confidence of getting rid of that boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The man froze in surprise for a moment before laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bat, what are you laughing at?\u201d Sky glared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I laugh?\u201d The man closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>He then showed an intoxicated expression and continued, \u201cThis is wonderful ... That fool is finally going to die... but I do not even need to bear any responsibility. Is there anything more wonderful than this in the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, lunatic...\u201d Sky sighed. \u201cNo wonder people said that your clan is crazy. Looks like they are right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy, so what...\u201d After another soft sigh, the man\u2019s voice sounded peculiar, \u201cThere are a lot of crazy people in this world, not to mention us, who are half man and half ghost. Fatty, even if nothing would happen to that Duke of the Tulip Family, he definitely would not be able to fight so many of us. Even if he does not die, the same cannot be said for his men.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky shrugged his shoulders and replied, \u201cWhat has this got to do with me? Their lives have got nothing to do with me. The earlier one dies, the earlier he gets detached. What is the difference if one dies a few days earlier or a few days later?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man sighed softly. \u201cLooks like I was wrong. You are even more cold-blooded than me. However, you may have forgotten. Those that were bitten by us will not die. Instead, they will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Stop!\u201d Sky shook his head. \u201cThe more you speak, the more I feel like vomiting! I do not want to think about those fangs of your clan... At least, I will try not to think about it...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d That man\u2019s voice gradually became warmer. \u201cStrange fatty, let\u2019s find a way to enjoy this wonderful night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh.\u201d Sky sighed. \u201cThis is really preposterous1... Oh, not right, you are really a vampire. I saw that you are quite skilled. At first, I wanted to get rid of you along the way. However, you have actually learned how to use \u2018Blood Escape\u2019. So, I wanted to see what kind of genius your clan has... Hey, I guess you are about two hundred years old? You actually learned \u2018Blood Escape\u2019. That is extraordinary. However, I am disappointed because you are like the rest of the elders in your entire clan\u2014 outright crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The man smiled and asked, \u201cIn that case, what do you want, fatty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky glared back coldly and replied, \u201cWhat do I want? I want to twist off your neck!\u201d After that, his body suddenly dashed out. In the dark, there seemed to be an oppressive shadow pouncing on the black- clothed man.</p><br/><p>The man seemed to have already taken precautions. He gently rolled his cloak, and his figure then disappeared from the place.</p><br/><p>Sky immediately stopped and cursed, \u201cLittle bat, do you have any more new tricks? Why are you using this \u2018Blood Escape\u2019 again? Do you really think I cannot catch you? Obediently stretch your neck over, so that I can twist it off. This will save us all the trouble! Hmm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky suddenly laughed as he pointed at his ears. \u201cLittle bat, did you notice? In just a short while, four of your companions had died. No\u2026 it was five of them. Haha... Are you feeling anxious now?\u201d</p><br/><p>A black figure suddenly appeared from above him. The figure, wrapped in a black cloak, was hanging upside down on a tree like a large bat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I worry? After all, those who died were not my subordinates. It is better that they died. Let your Duke of the Tulip Family kill them all. Why should I bother? \u201d</p><br/><p>Before the man could say anymore, Sky's eyes lit up; he stomped his feet and launched himself towards the figure.</p><br/><p>The man gently smiled and his body disappeared again. Sky hit the tree branch above him with his head. The branch slowly fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, you used this trick again! Do you think your clan's \u2018Blood Escape\u2019 technique is really invincible? Do you really think I have no other way to attack you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, fatty. If you have any other methods, you would have killed me on our way here!\u201d The voice came from a branch a few meters away. The man smiled as he stood on a branch that was as thick as a finger. As the wind blew, his body swayed together with the branches and he looked like a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow irritating!\u201d Sky coldly said, \u201cInitially, I wanted to take it easy but it seems you will not be convinced unless I get serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky suddenly closed his eyes and his lips moved a bit. After that, his obese body also disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Is this your method to catch me? An invisibility technique?\u201d The black-clothed man laughed and continued, \u201cDo you think stealth is enough to catch me? Did you think that the Blood Clan\u2019s \u2018Blood Escape\u2019 is just a stealth technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky's voice sounded in the darkness. \u201cI don't care what you say! Isn\u2019t this fair? We both cannot see each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha.\u201d The black-clothed man smiled. \u201cHumans are truly humans. They are actually stupid! I admit that your stealth technique works as I cannot see you. However, the moment you talked, you were exposed\u2026 Ah!\u201d Towards the end of his sentence, the man suddenly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>The man forcefully fell off the branch, head first. He screamed as his body started to give out a black smoke. Before he landed, he already turned around and stood up in midair again. However, his elegant expression was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually dare to trick me?\u201d His eyes gradually turned red, and his mouth had a trace of blood. \u201cDespicable human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky laughed loudly and his body finally appeared beneath a tree. \u201cHow? If you can lie to me, why can\u2019t I lie to you? You, little bat... This is just a simple stealth technique, together with a duplication technique, and you already cannot cope already. I heard that those who could master the \u2018Blood Escape\u2019 within two hundred years are geniuses!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I am certainly a genius!\u201d The man smiled and spoke in a low voice, \u201cHave you felt it? The human\u2019s aura is becoming bleak... Fortunately, there is no full moon tonight. Do you want to go back and take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You are really not afraid that I would wring off your head!\u201d</p><br/><p>1 Jian gui, Can mean preposterous or something like \u2018What the hell\u2019. Individually, the word Jian would mean meet and Gui would mean ghost. On the other hand, xi xue gui  vampires, could mean blood sucking ghost.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

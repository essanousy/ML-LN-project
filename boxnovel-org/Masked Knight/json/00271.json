Look, the Thousand Rider General and Koichi are arguing endlessly. If Yukinari can help the Thousand Rider General get the rights to command, he could definitely win him over and earn his respect. How could he let go of such an opportunity to win favors?\"</p><br/><p>Rody was silent for a few seconds. He then said, \"Not necessarily.\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari said in a clear and loud voice, \"My questions are very simple. First of all, the people on the Roland Continent may not be harmonious with us. However, we have had peace for hundreds of years! Why did they suddenly attack us? If we do not even know their purpose, the war is simply not worthwhile.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hm\u2026\" Everybody nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Second\u2026\" Yukinari became calmer and his voice became louder. \"We have fifty thousand soldiers stationed in the South. Kumu Yu is also one of Father\u2019s generals that are experienced in war. Why did he keep losing to the Roland people? From the start of the battle until now, his troops were almost utterly routed! It was as if the Roland people know our military situations! Father. Don\u2019t you find this strange?\"</p><br/><p>These two problems were the words Nedis used to bluff him a few days ago. However, at that moment, these same questions made everyone fall into deep thought.</p><br/><p>Koichi looked at his little brother with a complicated gaze. He could not figure out how his brother completely changed after going to Home River. Although Yukinari\u2019s words were said in general terms, it was not groundless. In fact, these thoughts had long since existed in everyone\u2019s minds.</p><br/><p>\"Young Master Yukinari\u2019s words truly makes sense!\" Nobunaga suddenly said in a loud voice. He gave Yukinari a glance. His tone suddenly changed as he said, \"However, these two questions are too complicated. A lot of time may be needed to investigate these one by one! Right now, the situation is tense. The troops need to be dispatched immediately! The more time we spend discussing these, the more hard-pressed the situation in the South would become!\" He looked steadfast at the Shogun then said, \"Shogun, please transmit your order!\"</p><br/><p>Koichi then loudly said, \"Father, I think it is necessary to take a good consideration of younger brother\u2019s words!\" He turned to look at Yukinari and then said, \"In particular, the reason why the Roland army could defeat our troops so easily. If we cannot understand this, I believe that even if we change the person in charge, we would still meet with failure.\"</p><br/><p>As soon as he said that, he suddenly clapped his hands without waiting for Nobunaga to speak.</p><br/><p>There were loud footsteps from outside. The door to the meeting room was then opened as two guards from the shogunate brought in a bloody soldier.</p><br/><p>The soldier\u2019s armor was broken. His bloodstained face blurred his facial features. His wounds were already treated but without the two guards supporting him, he would not be able to walk and would have already fallen down.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone!\" Koichi stood up and spoke in a loud voice, \"This is a soldier that has returned from the frontlines. He can explain to you why Kumu Yu is in such a miserable state!\"</p><br/><p>Nedis sighed. \"Looks like I have made a wrong guess. Yukinari\u2019s move is now entirely in vain.\"</p><br/><p>Koichi had unexpectedly already prepared a defeated soldier from the frontlines.</p><br/><p>If one were to think deeper, the Shogun had earlier already made up his mind of selecting Koichi as the commander for the soldiers.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, there would have been no need to prepare a wounded soldier to wait at the door. After all, they were at the meeting hall of the shogunate. Nobody could just wait there without the Shogun\u2019s permission.</p><br/><p>The father and son had already arranged this in advance.</p><br/><p>Their act was complete. The wounded soldier\u2019s disguise was also at a professional level. But, if it was a real wounded soldier, they would have changed their clothes and cleaned themselves before coming.</p><br/><p>\"You!\" Koichi pointed at the wounded soldier and said, \"Tell us the situation at the frontlines!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" The wounded man knelt and started to narrate in a loud voice.</p><br/><p>\"Six days ago, the Roland army came from the ocean. They captured two military towns at the Southern coast, Divine River and Longwood. As we did not receive a warning from the navy, our garrison was attacked and defeated! Kumu Yu had hastily organized a resistance, but the enemy seemed to know our gathering location and time. We were defeated before we had the chance to regroup! Kumu Yu could only withdraw and lead us back to the mouth of the mountains south of Home River to block the enemy!\" The soldier said all that in one breath. He took some time to breathe and then continued, \"On the first day of the war, we stubbornly held our ground. However, the next day, the Roland army suddenly sent out a strange unit.\"</p><br/><p>\"What kind of unit is it? Let everyone hear it!\" Nobunaga suddenly coldly said.</p><br/><p>\"Chariots!\" The soldier showed an expression of fear. \"It was a monster. Our bows, arrows and shields could not stop them\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed. He had already experienced how formidable the chariots were at the Sauron Kingdom. A common soldier was definitely not a match for the monstrous chariot. It was no wonder the dwarfs were defeated so miserably.</p><br/><p>There was no suspense after that. Koichi already had a plan. After the soldier had described how they were defeated, he then demonstrated how he now fully comprehended the situation in the South.</p><br/><p>He no longer needed to speak. Everybody already knew that the commanding position would go to him.</p><br/><p>Besides that, these people were not stupid. How could there be a wounded soldier waiting without the Shogun\u2019s permission? Since this was the Shogun\u2019s intentions, the rest no longer needed to say anything.</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly narrowed his eyes as he noticed something wrong.</p><br/><p>Nobunaga loudly said, \"Young Master Koichi may have thought this thoroughly. But do you have a plan for winning the South?\" %%</p><br/><p>Koichi nodded and replied, \"Of course there is. But\u2026\" He looked at the Thousand Rider General and said, \"To win, I need the cooperation of the Thousand Rider General.\"</p><br/><p>As soon as he said that, Yukinari turned pale. He was sure that his brother wanted to take this opportunity to obtain military power. If the brother obtained the cavalry, Yukinari would no longer have any more ideas.</p><br/><p>Nedis suddenly pulled Rody and said, \"Looks like we have wasted our effort to help this guy.\"</p><br/><p>Rody glanced at Nedis and replied, \"Let us wait and see first.\"</p><br/><p>Nobunaga gave Koichi a glance. He suddenly and loudly said, \"Shogun, I strongly request that you dispatch me to the South!\"</p><br/><p>Everybody felt as though the Thousand Rider General lacked judgment. Koichi turned to Nobunaga and coldly asked, \"What makes you worthy of raising such a rude request?\"</p><br/><p>Nobunaga pulled out his katana halfway and shouted, \"Based on my Murasame1 and my Wind Cross Slash!\" He eyes glinted as he looked around and loudly said, \"I am the eternal warrior of the Hakone Kingdom! The battlefield requires military skills, courage, and resolution. Can the Young Master Koichi admit that he can defeat my sword? If not, can you confidently request for the enemy to leave in comfort? On the battlefield, only the sword speaks!\"</p><br/><p>He then pulled out a thin katana and held it with both hands as he said, \"May God Bless the Hakone warriors!\"</p><br/><p>The Shogun\u2019s expression sank, and he looked unhappy. He was about to speak when Koichi stood up with his chest held high. Koichi looked at the Thousand Rider General\u2019s face and said, \"Nobunaga, do you truly insist on doing this?\"</p><br/><p>Nobunaga remained silent and solemnly nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Good!\" Koichi loudly shouted. He turned around to look at the Shogun and said, \"Father, since the Thousand Rider General has said this, I am willing to accept this condition! We will duel. The winner will go to the South!\"</p><br/><p>The audience was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>Rody saw everyone\u2019s reaction and was certain that Koichi was definitely not at Nobunaga\u2019s level. Everybody\u2019s astonished reaction has already demonstrated this point.</p><br/><p>Nedis also frowned, \"I am a bit confused. Isn\u2019t Koichi already the commander?\"</p><br/><p>Rody narrowed his eyes as he looked at Koichi. He then looked at Nobunaga. He had always felt like the two of them had a secret agreement. He then moved over to Nedis\u2019 ears and whispered, \"Quiet! Looks like we are going to see a good show here today!\" He paused and then looked at Yukinari. He then quietly said, \"If something happens, protect the younger Kikukawa. Make sure he is safe.\"</p><br/><p>\"What about you?\" Nedis could not comprehend.</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and no longer said anything.</p><br/><p>Nobunaga looked at Koichi and loudly said, \"Young Master Koichi, I am not bullying you. Your military might is weaker compared to mine. This is something everybody here knows. Even if I win, there is no glory!\" He had a hideous expression as he coldly said, \"Why don\u2019t you pick someone in your command to fight against me? If one of your people can defeat me, I will absolutely no longer compete for the position of commander with you.\"</p><br/><p>Rody gently smiled, \"Look, the play has started!\"</p><br/><p>Nedis secretly pulled Yukinari to her side feeling puzzled. What kind of trick were Koichi and Nobunaga doing?</p><br/><p>Koichi had seemingly not wanted the position of commander. He insistently promised Nobunaga a duel.</p><br/><p>However, Nobunaga had acted even stranger. He would have obviously won but he rejected his advantage and insisted for Koichi to send out a warrior to fight him. The Shogun frowned. It was obvious that things were out of his control. It had also gone far beyond his expectations.</p><br/><p>\"In that case, let me replace Young Master Koichi to duel with the Thousand Rider General!\" A majestic voice suddenly came from the side.</p><br/><p>It was the middle-aged warrior that sat one position below Koichi. This person looked sturdy and valiant. There was also a faintly discernable scar on his face. He has large arms with bulky joints. One look was enough to tell that he was a strong person.</p><br/><p>Nobunaga looked at him. His eyes became stern as he ferociously said, \"Good! You! You are strong enough to be my opponent!\" He then looked at Koichi and asked, \"What is your decision?\"</p><br/><p>Koichi stood there perfectly calm and lightly said, \"I approve!\"</p><br/><p>The Shogun looked imposing and loudly said, \"Have you really decided to gamble the position of commander?\"</p><br/><p>The three of them nodded at the same time.</p><br/><p>The Shogun grunted, apparently feeling dissatisfied. However, everybody was looking at him. He could only grit his teeth and said, \"Then, I shall promise to grant your request. May God bless the Hakone warriors!\"</p><br/><p>Everybody then left their seats and moved back. A large space was opened up in the middle. Koichi calmly leaned against the door. His expression was unreadable.</p><br/><p>In the middle, the middle-aged warrior and Nobunaga stood against each other. They slowly drew out their katanas.</p><br/><p>Nobunaga gently stroked his blade and said, \"My Murasame is a gift from His Majesty! It has drunk the blood of countless warriors. You\u2019d best be careful.\"</p><br/><p>The other warrior looked indifferent and clenched his own weapon. However, when Rody looked at his frozen expression, it was as if he could feel a solemn and stirring implication.</p><br/><p>A thought suddenly flashed through Rody\u2019s mind. Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>The Thousand Rider General raised his weapon and shouted, \"I, Oda Nobunaga, will have no regrets if I were to die by your blade today!\"</p><br/><p>\"I am the same!\" The middle-aged warrior coldly said, \"I am Shinyu! As for the rest, please.\"</p><br/><p>With a sudden and violent shout, the two warriors rushed at each other. Their katanas clashed, causing sparks to appear.</p><br/><p>Translator's Note:</p><br/><p>1.  Rain Village. Turn it around and you get Village Rain, the literal name for Murasame.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

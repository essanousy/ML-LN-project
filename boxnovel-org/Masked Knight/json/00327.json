A light of despair flashed in his eyes, along with a tinge of madness.</p><br/><p>The spear pointed at the pope who stood upright and unafraid. He raised his wand high and bellowed, \"Come on, young Rody! Even if I die here today, I will bring you apostate to hell with me!\"</p><br/><p>Poof! The spear pierced through Corsica VI's body. The black flame spread along the spear into the pope's body, but an odd glow appeared in the pope's eyes.</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes and he chanted a spell slowly\u2026</p><br/><p>Ripples of energy started to flow out from the wand and spread out in the air silently.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>The Dracula Spear was the Vampire Tribe's magical weapon. The flesh and blood of those who were pierced by this magical weapon would be sucked dry. Even their souls would be absorbed into the spear and imprisoned in it for eternity.</p><br/><p>However, the spear had pierced through the pope's body and left a massive hole in his chest, but everything seemed to have frozen. Although fresh red blood was slowly spilling out, there was nothing else unusual about the pope's body except for his face which had become paler.</p><br/><p>Rody could indistinctly make out the golden rays radiating from the pope, which suppressed the devil flame on the Dracula Spear. The golden rays did not look like any Light Series Spells. This aura\u2026</p><br/><p>Rody's heart sank. He had an uneasy feeling.</p><br/><p>This aura, it felt like\u2026.</p><br/><p>It felt like the same aura that Rody had experienced during the battle with the Hakone Serpent in the Roland Continent! That aura was completely different from any power in this world. It was an aura beyond human strength! It was not a fighting energy, not a Domain Master's energy, but\u2026.</p><br/><p>The level of Gods! Rody finally understood why he was so familiar with this aura.</p><br/><p>It was because traces of a 'Divine Primordial Spirit' fluctuated with it!</p><br/><p>The smile on the pope's pale face became creepier. He opened his mouth and released some golden gas. He then gave a sad laugh and said, \"Marquis Rody, let's go to hell together!\"</p><br/><p>As he was saying that, he waved his wand gently, and a golden light shot into the air towards the clouds like a sharp arrow. It looked as though it could pierce a hole in the sky.</p><br/><p>Rody's heart raced and he subconsciously withdrew the spear, but it felt like some force was controlling the Dracula Spear, and the golden rays emitted from the pope was rapidly devouring the black flame on the Dracula Spear. The body of the Dracula Spear started to buzz, and Rody could clearly feel the spear vibrating!</p><br/><p>Rody gritted his teeth and let go of the spear. His other hand grabbed the Dragon Spell Scimitar and struck it forward violently.</p><br/><p>The pope sighed and closed his eyes, but he held out one hand and warded off Rody's scimitar bare-handed.</p><br/><p>A loud clang was heard.</p><br/><p>As Rody's scimitar which carried golden fighting energy struck heavily on the pope's arm, a loud noise was made. Under the protection of the golden rays on the pope's arms, his arms emitted a strange glow that made it seem like it was not made of flesh and blood anymore.</p><br/><p>A thundering sound exploded, and Rody felt a shock from the great impact that his body was unable to resist as his body shot backward.</p><br/><p>An arm soared into the sky. The pope cried out in pain and his body staggered, almost collapsing onto the ground. He spurted blood again and sighed, \"Good! Good! Good! Good one, Marquis Rody! I didn't expect that besides having the Dracula Spear, your scimitar carries the Dragon Tribe's curse! Even my magical body could not withstand it!\"</p><br/><p>Rody was shocked as his arm ached and went limp.</p><br/><p>Although he had only recovered to the Sacred Swordsman level, he could smash a huge rock with his scimitar laced with fighting energy in just one blow. But now, the pope warded off his attack with his bare arm, and even knocked him off!</p><br/><p>Rody felt that his fighting energy was smashed by the impact just now. He took a deep breath with great difficulty and managed to suppress his scattered energy.</p><br/><p>The pope narrowed his eyes, and the golden rays from his body became more and more dazzling. He had an inviolably sacred and majestic aura around him.</p><br/><p>The golden beam from the wand in his hand connected directly to the sky, and it tore open the vault of heaven. Flames and thunders poured down from the opening, burning the sky and even suppressing the rays of the rising sun in the east.</p><br/><p>A strange phenomenon was formed in the sky. Half of it occupied by the rising sun, and the other half was full of thunders and lightning!</p><br/><p>\"Rody, you are already very powerful\u2026I did not hesitate to shorten my life and merge my body with the artifact gifted by the Gods to the church. I thought that none of the weapons in this world can harm me anymore, but I did not expect that\u2026\" He glanced at his amputated arm.</p><br/><p>Before Rody could speak, a cold voice rang from afar, \"You've committed the sin of blasphemy by merging your mortal body with God's artifact! As a pope, how dare you steal the power of the Gods!\"</p><br/><p>Mouse drifted to Rody's side like a whiff of smoke. There was concern in her eyes, and she placed a healing spell on Rody's body.</p><br/><p>\"Be careful\u2026\" Mouse whispered, \"Those who have merged with the God's artifact, even if you rip their flesh, you will be struck back by the artifact's natural powers!\"</p><br/><p>Rody sneered, \"It's just an artifact. I've seen many of them, what can it do to me!\"</p><br/><p>Mouse's eyes fell on the pope standing at a distance who was emitting dazzling golden rays. She clenched her teeth, \"This is not the same, not the same. We've only seen ordinary artifacts. The force exerted by those artifacts were driven by human's magical powers, but since he had merged his body with the artifact, that means he is now using his life to drive the artifact!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah\u2026\" The pope suddenly opened his mouth and rays of golden light spilled out. The expression on his face seemed like he was in extreme agony. The golden fighting energy from his body flowed continuously onto the wand, which then became a beam shooting directly up into the sky. The beam kept tearing the opening bigger and bigger!</p><br/><p>Mouse's expression changed, and she exclaimed in shock, \"It's the Heaven Mending Stone! It's the Heaven Mending Stone! This old devil has refined the treasured artifact of the religion, the Heaven Mending Stone, into his body!\"</p><br/><p>She grabbed Rody and shouted, \"We cannot kill him today, let's go!\"</p><br/><p>Rody struggled free from Mouse's grasp and roared, \"Why! If I don't kill him today, how long more do I have to wait for the next chance!\"</p><br/><p>He would not listen to Mouse. He held his scimitar and charged forward. Immediately, fighting energy exploded from his body, and a magnificent Half-Moon Slash shot across the sky.</p><br/><p>Following a loud crack, the Half Moon Slash collided with the golden rays radiating from the pope. It then dissipated, but the pope trembled, and blood trickled from his mouth\u2014even his blood had become golden in hue!</p><br/><p>Rody already came in front of him and raised his scimitar before swinging it down onto his head!</p><br/><p>Clang! It was as though it had struck something metallic. Rody could clearly see the golden rays from the pope's body entered the scimitar in his hand, and also a great resistance! As he inched deeper, his strength would be rapidly neutralized. Finally, Rody roared and his scimitar sliced through the pope's skull!</p><br/><p>Crack! One-third of the pope's head was sliced open, but then something weird happened.</p><br/><p>No blood was spilled, and no brain matter splattered out. One-third of the pope's head was split open, but Rody groaned and suddenly flung out. The scimitar in his hands vibrated in agony as if it was overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>Mouse raced towards him, but before she could come to Rody's side, he was already struggling to stand up. His hands were covered with blood. He already used all his strength for that blow just now, but it merely split open one-third of the pope's head! And the part between his thumb and index finger was torn due to the impact.</p><br/><p>The pope looked creepy with his head split into two and the Dracula Spear impaled in his chest, but he still stood firm without any sign of collapsing. A chuckle came from his mouth, but that chuckle did not sound human-like anymore.</p><br/><p>Finally, a golden ray spilled out from his mouth and fell heavily onto his wand. He then slowly collapsed and sat on the ground.</p><br/><p>Rody stared at the pope sitting afar in disbelief. He asked through gritted teeth, \"What is going on?\"</p><br/><p>Mouse shook his head, \"You can't kill him! His body is equivalent to a God's artifact! Can you destroy the Dracula Spear? Can you break the Dracula Spear into two? Even if it's you, it's still impossible right?\"</p><br/><p>Rody immediately recalled himself trying to destroy the Dracula Spear a long time ago. Indeed, it was not easy to destroy a God's artifact or a magical weapon.</p><br/><p>During their conversation, the roar of thunder became more and more violent. Flashes of purple thunderbolts struck down from the sky. The gorgeous lightning filled the sky like writhing snakes.</p><br/><p>Rody's expression changed, \"Why on earth did he pierce a large hole in the sky?\"</p><br/><p>The pope sat there, his head eerily split in half, and he suddenly opened his eyes. Mouse's hair stood on end as the scene she saw was too scary.</p><br/><p>An intangible voice floated into their ears, \"Rody, receive the God's punishment\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"God's Vanquishing Spell\u2026\"</p><br/><p>After a loud boom, a lightning the size of a huge axe struck down right on the pope's wand. However, there was no explosion. The pope and his wand became ashes and smoke in the midst of the purple lightning! They had become invisible!</p><br/><p>A gigantic hand stretched out from the sky and completely tore open the crack in the vault of heaven. A large black hole appeared, and a golden armored giant formed from light stepped out from the black hole!</p><br/><p>Mouse was stupefied as she looked at the weird phenomena in the sky. She muttered, \"It's indeed the God's Vanquishing Spell! It is the supreme magic that has been lost for thousands of years, the God's Vanquishing Spell!\" she shook his head and said in a low voice, \"The pope merged himself with the God's artifact, so he can perform the God's Vanquishing Spell alone without the assistance of others using Combination Magic. But the price he has to pay for using his life to drive the God's artifact is to finally become ashes and smoke!</p><br/><p>The gigantic warrior above, who looked like a god clad in golden armor, stepped out from the clouds. His eyes which resembled lightning gazed upon the earth, and a loud shattering howl came out from his mouth. The gigantic axe in his hand burnt with golden flames, which caused the sky to burn with a golden color.</p><br/><p>Immediately, a row of figures appeared behind him. All of them were warriors clad in golden armors. Their bodies were surrounded by golden flames, but they were smaller in size compared to the giant.</p><br/><p>They stood among the clouds like divine troops descended from heaven!</p><br/><p>\"Sinful apostate! You have the evil dragon breath in you!\" The golden armored giant suddenly roared in anger. His eyes fell on Rody. Immediately, two large beams surrounded Rody and pierced through his body, illuminating every inch of his body! Under the illumination of the light beams, Rody's fighting energy dispersed and became invisible. The innate nature of his force was revealed!</p><br/><p>That was a ball of black flames! The flames of the Mystic Dragon!</p><br/><p>The golden armored giant's roar sounded like thunder. A huge hand then waved, and the burning gigantic axe struck down above his head!</p><br/><p>The God's Vanquishing Spell had resurfaced!</p><br/><p>In the canyon dozens of miles away, Old Skeleton and Fatty looked at the strange phenomena in the distant sky in disbelief. Old Skeleton forcefully swallowed his saliva. He could feel bitterness in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\"How could this be possible\u2026how could this be possible\u2026How could the pope perform the God's Vanquishing Spell on his own? Oh no\u2026Is that boy Rody still alive? Even a Domain Master might not be able to withstand the God's Vanquishing Spell\u2026Moreover, Rody is not at the domain level now\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The flesh on Fatty Sky's face was trembling too. He was having a great struggle in his heart right now. Finally, he sighed and said loudly, \"The boy looks pleasing in my eyes, I must go to his rescue!\"</p><br/><p>When he was done, his large body suddenly soared into the air and flew towards the distance like a huge bird.</p><br/><p>Andy stomped his feet and cursed, \"If that boy dies, I'm afraid Nicole will put up a deadly fight with me. Little boy, I'm not willing to let you die\u2026\" When he finished saying, he immediately used his magic power to fly and followed after Fatty.</p><br/><p>Back there, Rody held his scimitar and looked arrogantly at the gigantic axe striking down from the sky. He pulled Mouse behind him and manipulated the fighting energy in his whole body. He rose into the air like a tiny sun and knocked into the giant axe!</p><br/><p>A loud boom was heard. It felt like the sky was falling and the earth was cracking apart\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

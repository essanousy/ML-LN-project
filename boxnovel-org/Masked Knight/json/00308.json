His entire body seemed to emit fierce black colored dragon aura. The powerful aura felt oppressive like it came from hell. His face, especially. It has a perilous tinge in of a feminine aura.</p><br/><p>Rody made a decision from the powerful presence.</p><br/><p>\u2018I cannot fight this guy in my current state!\u2019</p><br/><p>'But\u2026a Dragon God?'</p><br/><p>\u2018Do the dragons really have a God? If the dragons really have a God, shouldn\u2019t it be the Mystic Dragon?\u2019 Realizing this, Rody suddenly felt relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now, confronting any self-proclaimed God, I definitely cannot win especially when they are God-ranked. However, since I can confirm that he is not God-ranked, there may still be some hope.\u2019</p><br/><p>He who strikes first gains the advantage. This was what the teacher had taught him the first day he learned swordsmanship. It was used especially when he was at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Rody exchanged a quick look with Old Mark then rushed forward. Although he was unable to continue using his golden fighting energy, his scimitar that contained the dragon soul was still powerful. Old Mark\u2019s figure lightly floated over like a ghost. The sword in his hand was like a poisonous snake...</p><br/><p>The other side gave a contemptuous smile. He lightly pointed at Rody. Rody felt a black light arriving in front of him. His whole body shook, and then he was flung away.</p><br/><p>Another black light was shot at Old Mark but it was obvious that Old Mark was underestimated.</p><br/><p>Old Mark was definitely not weaker than any Paladin. Even if he was injured at that moment and was weaker, he was at a level where Rody could not compare. Old Mark gave out a sharp cry. His sword burst into a golden light. The sword hit the black light and then slashed at the self-proclaimed Dragon God.</p><br/><p>The self-proclaimed Dragon God finally dropped his expression of disdain and frowned. His body flashed and disappeared. He then appeared ten meters overhead.</p><br/><p>There was a loud whoosh. A huge pair of dragon wings appeared on his back that gently flapped in the sky.</p><br/><p>\"Good! You guys still have a Paladin! I have underestimated you!\"</p><br/><p>When Rody was struck by the black light, he was afraid he would become seriously injured even if he survived. He had not expected that he would feel more relaxed after standing firmly and then taking a deep breath. It was as though the black light had quickly dissolved into his body after hitting him. It secretly circulated around in his body a few times before disappearing...</p><br/><p>\u2018Strange\u2026What kind of weird attack is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Not only is it not painful...It even feels comfortable...\u2019</p><br/><p>The self-proclaimed Dragon God\u2019s expression turned cold. He extended his palm that soon magically changed into a grotesque light sword.</p><br/><p>However, this light sword was different from the others created by the fighting energy of ordinary Paladins or Domain Masters. The light on this sword would suddenly dim and suddenly brighten. The sword did not look like light but an actual solid.</p><br/><p>What made Rody even more surprised was that the shape of the sword looked familiar...</p><br/><p>Old Mark shouted as he rushed forward. He soared high into the sky and reached above the Dragon God before slashing down.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>There was a loud sound as the Dragon God swung his sword up to meet with Old Mark\u2019s sword. As the two swords crossed, Old Mark\u2019s sword emitted a metallic cracking sound. Half of the sword then flew up. Defeated, Old Mark quickly retreated.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God did not chase. He carefully stroked the blade of his sword looking satisfied.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph. How could your inferior weapon compare with my Dragon God\u2019s Sword!\"</p><br/><p>Rody looked and understood. He could not help but shouted, \"Nonsense! What Dragon God\u2019s Sword? It is just a Dragon Fang Sword! What is so great about turning the Mystic Dragon\u2019s Fang into a sword?\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up!\" The self-proclaimed Dragon God\u2019s expression immediately turned cold. His eyes flashed with anger. \"You dare to call His Majesty the Dragon God the Mystic Dragon? Bastard!\"</p><br/><p>A black light shot out form his sword and moved right towards Rody. Rody dared not dodge as Mouse and the others were behind him. If he dodged, those people behind him would be harmed. He gritted his teeth and blocked the attack with his scimitar.</p><br/><p>With a loud sound, the black lightning struck Rody\u2019s blade squarely. Rody roared loudly and his body shook. The powerful force that struck him caused his feet to sink into the ground!</p><br/><p>Although his legs were sore, the black light flowed into Rody\u2019s body from the sword. Like earlier, it was like a river water flowing into the ocean. Rody\u2019s body reacted. Unexpectedly a small force started to move and mix with this incoming external power. It then rapidly stirred in Rody\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>'This is the feeling of strength!'</p><br/><p>Rody was shocked and then delighted. This was the first time he felt the familiar power flowing inside his body since he came back from the Dwarven Kingdom.</p><br/><p>However, his joy did not last long. His strength immediately turned around and was sucked in as though there was a black hole in his body. He soon felt weaker and weaker until it was gone.</p><br/><p>Rody cursed, 'So, it was like that!'</p><br/><p>My strength was not lost but absorbed by that weird thing! Thinking about it, it must be that Kara\u2019s Divine Primordial Spirit!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Old Mark was fighting against the Dragon God in the sky. Although half of his sword was broken, he managed to deal against his opponent\u2019s offensive although with great effort.</p><br/><p>Rody could feel the Dragon God\u2019s powerful aura and see his horrifying strength. However, each of his attacks looked jerky as though\u2026</p><br/><p>'It looks as though this is his first fight?'</p><br/><p>Rody saw the Dragon Fang Sword burn with a blazing black flame. The flame felt faintly familiar. Rody thought of it for a moment and immediately recalled the place where he felt the familiar feeling.</p><br/><p>'It is Wuya!'</p><br/><p>'With the mountain tribes at the South of the Empire...The son of the Mystic Dragon. Wuya, the Elder of the mountain tribes. He had a similar aura!'</p><br/><p>Obviously, that opponent\u2019s attack was not something Old Mark could resist directly. He relied solely on his two hundred years of experience to dodge. The self-proclaimed Dragon God was angry but was still unable to use his strength properly.</p><br/><p>Rody took a look and realized that if it was him fighting, he would have three ways to attack Old Mark. However, the Dragon God did not seem to have any fighting experience.</p><br/><p>Rody gritted his teeth and roared out, \"Old Mark! Lead him down!\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark heard him. He, unable to hold out anymore, soon jumped down. A black light flashed behind him. Old Mark had immediately moved sideways but Rody went forward directly to take the attack and parry it with his scimitar.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Rody was once again sent flying from the tremendous force. Before he could fall, the strength had already been absorbed into his body. Rody, having had the previous two experiences, immediately took advantage of the time the force was circulating in his body to adjust his balance so that he could land steadily.</p><br/><p>Rody shouted and his body burst with golden fighting energy.</p><br/><p>He slashed out in a cross. The golden flames were forced into the blade of his scimitar. With a roar, two cross-shaped Half Moon Slash had been sent out.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God coldly laughed. He stretched out his hand to easily neutralize it. However, when the light slashes hit his body, he screamed and quickly retreated. His hand had instantly exploded into a badly mangled mass.</p><br/><p>A blackness on his face flashed twice and then his wound quickly healed up.</p><br/><p>Rody sneered. \"Hmph. Taking my Half Moon Slash with your bare hands? Did you really think you are a Dragon God?\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark shouted, \"Don\u2019t talk anymore! Take advantage of the moment and continue your attack!\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed bitterly. His attack only borrowed his opponent\u2019s energy. He had to let his body absorb the attack and take advantage of that moment to use the energy before it is absorbed by the Divine Primordial Spirit.</p><br/><p>However, the attack made Rody\u2019s strength dry up again.</p><br/><p>In a way, Rody was now like a bucket with a hole at the bottom. No matter how much water was poured in, it would all leak out. This was why Rody was unable to gain any strength.</p><br/><p>Old Mark saw the look in Rody and no longer questioned him. Rody thought of something and said, \"Find a way to provoke him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright!\"</p><br/><p>Without any feelings of doubt, Old Mark raised his half-broken sword and rushed up again. However, Rody did not attack but just followed at the back of Old Mark.</p><br/><p>Old Mark attacked the Dragon God directly while Rody hanged around at the periphery. He would help with a few slashes at every opportunity. The Dragon God roared loudly and suddenly burst into a mass of black flames. Old Mark immediately created a ball of energy in front to protect himself as he shouted, \"Back!\"</p><br/><p>Rody did not retreat but, instead, advanced! He stood right in front of the Dragon God! A faint black lightning shot out of the Dragon Fang Sword. Small black balls of energy had gathered and condensed rapidly at the swordpoint. The Dragon God released an earth-shattering roar. The black ball of energy then shot towards Rody.</p><br/><p>\"Damn! Why are you making so much noise! Did you think I have never heard a dragon\u2019s roar before?\" Rody scolded as he rushed up.</p><br/><p>While Old Mark and the Dragon God were still surprised, Rody had already been hit by the black ball of energy but the black ball did not explode as expected. Instead, it wrapped around Rody and was quickly absorbed into Rody\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God was furious and roared loudly. He then slashed out with the Dragon Fang Sword a dozen times. Each slash carried an intense, electrifying black light.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the sky was covered with black lightning striking densely into Rody\u2019s body. At that moment, Rody was wrapped in the black energy mass. When the lightning struck the black energy around him he was sent flying around like a leaf in a fierce gale.</p><br/><p>Rody endured the physical tearing pain he felt as his body endlessly absorbed the black energy in the attacks.</p><br/><p>'Hit me again! Hit me! Hit me more! Hit me more!'</p><br/><p>Rody roared in his heart, and then finally cried out loudly.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>The Dragon God finally realized the weird situation. He stopped suddenly and quickly retreated about ten meters away.</p><br/><p>The black energy around Rody gradually faded. His clothes were burned by the black lightning and his body was injured. However, his face was covered with a layer of black qi, especially his eyes.</p><br/><p>His eyes had turned completely black and the trace of black energy made him look a little evil.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026you were having fun attacking me earlier, weren\u2019t you?\" Rody shouted.</p><br/><p>Rody stretched out his hand. Black balls of energy quickly gathered at his palm. It was similar to the Dragon God\u2019s attack but it was even more violent and frightening.</p><br/><p>In an extremely quick manner, the black ball of energy quickly grew larger. Crackling sounds could be heard at the periphery as the black light flashed...</p><br/><p>After that, there was a dragon\u2019s roar that seemed to come from hell. A black dragon\u2019s head burst out of the ball of light, whistling and roaring, shooting towards the Dragon God.</p><br/><p>\"Mystic Dragon\u2019s Purge!\" The Dragon God\u2019s expression turned ashen immediately. He shouted and retreated like a meteor.</p><br/><p>However, the speed of the black dragon was faster than him. The black energy in the sky had already locked on to him. Seeing the dragon's head in front of him, the Dragon God\u2019s face was distorted as he shouted, \"Impossible! You are supposed to be dead!\"</p><br/><p>His body suddenly expanded a few ten times and transformed into a roaring black dragon. He sent out a dragon\u2019s breath towards the approaching dragon.</p><br/><p>The hellfire of the Mystic Dragon\u2019s Purge broke through the Dragon God\u2019s last protective screen. The small dragon and the large dragon in the sky collided. There were loud roars causing countless shockwaves. Old Mark had already pulled Rody over and pressed him to the ground. The two of them continued to lie prostrate on the ground.</p><br/><p>The sky exploded with thunderous rumbling sounds as though the sky had collapsed. Suddenly the Dragon God\u2019s body expanded and exploded with a loud sound.</p><br/><p>When the hellfire burned down the clouds in the sky, it slowly dispersed.</p><br/><p>In the mist, a black ball of light slowly fell from the sky. It was like a figure slowly descending to the ground.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately called out. \"It is a soul! High leveled cultivators can preserve their souls after the death of the body!\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark had already rushed towards the spirit as he shouted, \"Do not let him escape!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The thing that made it even more awkward was...The status of that Marquis Rody was somewhat ambiguous and therefore the specification of the wedding ceremony would be some kind of a challenge.</p><br/><p>He was a Marquis and he was going to marry the older sister of the Duke of the Tulip Family. More importantly, the groom was the illegitimate son of His Majesty...the only son, as it was right then.</p><br/><p>When such a person got married, what kind of rules should the wedding follow? If in accordance with the customs of the ordinary aristocrats, apparently, it would not be appropriate. If in case, in future, that Marquis became an emperor...Heh, heh, the wedding of the future Emperor and Empress of Radiant Empire could not be too simple. Otherwise, in the case of a moment of anger in the future, the unlucky person would probably be their own self.</p><br/><p>So if it was arranged in accordance with the regulations of the royal family, it obviously was also not appropriate. After all, then, the relationship between His Excellency the Marquis and His Majesty the Emperor had not been made public. If it was arranged in accordance with the regulations of the royal family, and in case people resented and blamed him for meddling, then the unlucky one would probably still be their own self.</p><br/><p>Awkward, Really awkward...</p><br/><p>Finally, that clever official really had no more idea. So, he could only go directly to His Majesty the Emperor to ask for his opinion. His Majesty's reply was, \"Make it as grand as possible!\"</p><br/><p>Because of that statement made by the Old Skeleton, the scene of Rody's wedding was astonishing.</p><br/><p>Early in the next morning, a team of cavalry from the Imperial Guards, wearing the brightest uniforms, was already very busy. They covered the roads in the Imperial Capital, all the way from the mansion of the Duke of the Tulip Family to the mansion of the Marquis, with red carpets.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, two thousand Imperial Guards, wearing the most outstanding outfits, temporarily controlled the traffic flow of that section of the road.</p><br/><p>A team of Royal Musician Guards of Honor formed an array outside the mansion of the Marquis playing the most celebrated song. Following which, the youngest Marquis of the Empire was ready to set out to greet his bride.</p><br/><p>The following scene was an eye-opener for the people of the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>The full five thousand fully armed 'Wolf Fang' cavalry from the 'Lightning God's Whip' present was of course not going to war that day. The 'Wolf Fang' warriors were wearing the normal outfits that they used for the grand inspection ceremony. The warriors were in a mile-long formation in the street starting from the front of the mansion of the Duke of the Tulip Family to greet them. All of those brave warriors wore happy smiles on their faces. The older sister of their invincible commander was getting married that day. Sieg had picked five thousand men from the 'Wolf Fang' to serve as the guard of honor to greet them. Those five thousand men were carefully selected in order to be able to serve their invincible commander effectively. Actually, those young warriors would even break their heads to be a part of the soldiers selected for the group.</p><br/><p>The five thousand 'Wolf Fang' exhibited the most mighty and formidable stance. In contrast, those Imperial Guards whom Marquis Rody brought with him to greet the bride were somewhat inadequate.</p><br/><p>When Rody and his entire group of people approached, Rody, who was riding on a white horse, looked down the street. Standing on both sides of the street to greet him were all 'Wolf Fang' warriors. He was so angry that his nose almost went crooked 1 .</p><br/><p>'Today is my wedding day! We are not going to war! Why create such a murderous setting!'</p><br/><p>There was a swishing sound.</p><br/><p>When Rody walked into the array of the 'Wolf Fang', all the five thousand soldiers raised their scimitars, at the same time. For a moment, the brightness of the scimitars flashed, giving Rody a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>However, it had always been like this in the Radiant Empire. The Empire had always advocated martial skills. From the decree of the aristocracy regarding inheritance of the title for the common people, everyone would regard the ability to obtain warrior status as a glory. Even the customs of wedding ceremonies also carried some such uninhibited atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Under the brightness of the scimitars of the 'Wolf Fang', Rody, with only a thousand Imperial Guards, could only make every effort to straighten his back atop his horse. He maintained a graceful and majestic appearance and refused to lose any bit of loftiness.</p><br/><p>In the distance, just at the doorstep of the mansion of the Duke of the Tulip Family, there was a young man sitting on a black steed. He had long, bright golden hair that dazzled like sunlight and a pair of lake-blue eyes. He also had a handsome face that even the Sun God was jealous of. He wore the outfit of an Imperial Marshal. He was none other than the Duke of the Tulip Family, His Excellency Seth!</p><br/><p>That scene was an extraordinary custom of the Empire.</p><br/><p>That was because the Empire advocated martial arts. In a military leader's wedding ceremony, the groom must first undergo a test from the family of the bride... That test was naturally a martial arts competition.</p><br/><p>Although it was a wedding ceremony and it was just for show, usually they would also let both parties demonstrate their martial skills. That was to show that both parties were excellent at martial arts.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, the persons stepping forth to test the groom were usually the father or older brother of the bride. Since Nicole's father had passed away a long time ago, so naturally that legendary Empire's most formidable and forever invincible, the Great His Excellency the Duke of the Tulip Family would personally test the martial prowess of Marquis Rody.</p><br/><p>According to everyone's opinion, that newly-appointed Marquis, the young Rody, should feel much honored to have a chance to be guided by the Great Excellency the Duke of the Tulip Family.</p><br/><p>In reality, at that moment, Seth was mumbling and secretly cursing the original person who established that kind of custom.</p><br/><p>\u2018\"Test\" Rody's martial prowess? What the hell. With just a slash of his sword, he would be able to strike me down from the horse!'</p><br/><p>Rody bottled up his laughter. Looking at Seth, who was sitting on the horse and trying his best to keep calm, Rody called out loudly, \"Your Excellency the Duke.\"</p><br/><p>Seth gave a gentle cough and then slowly pulled out his slender sword. He spoke slowly in a dignified tone, \"Draw your weapon, Warrior Rody! Let me see if you are qualified to enter the Tulip Family clan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Long live the Tulip Family!\"</p><br/><p>\"Long live the Tulip Family!\"</p><br/><p>As soon as the commander pulled out his sword, the five thousand 'Wolf Fang' simultaneously issued a sky-shattering cheer!</p><br/><p>That sound shot straight up to the sky. Rody was already accustomed to such a scene. On the contrary, it almost gave Seth a shock.</p><br/><p>Those five thousand 'Wolf Fang' were elite soldiers. Many of them had followed Rody to the northwest Great Moon Kingdom. They had also participated in the holy war against the invading Roland armies and most of them had personally witnessed the invincible might of His Excellency the Duke on the battlefield. Although Rody was nominally a personal guard of the Duke, because he showed up using his real identity too late into the war, most of these soldiers did not know him.</p><br/><p>However, just thinking that this guy could actually marry the beautiful older sister of His Excellency the Duke made people envious. In addition, getting the guidance of His Excellency the Duke truly made people jealous.</p><br/><p>\"Well, come on.\" Rody pulled out his scimitar and kicked the stomach of the horse. He moved closer to Seth and whispered, \"Rest assured, I will maintain propriety.\"</p><br/><p>After he finished saying that, he struck straight down towards Seth with his scimitar.</p><br/><p>To be honest, when Seth saw the flash from the scimitar, his instinctive response was to dodge. However, before he even had time to dodge, he already heard Rody whisper, \"Raise your hand!\"</p><br/><p>Seth instinctively raised the longsword in his hand. He only saw the two weapons clashed with a tinkling sound. Seth did not feel any tremendous force. Instead, he felt the longsword in his hand was empty as if that strike that Rody made with his scimitar was without a trace of strength.</p><br/><p>Rody deliberately said loudly, \"Very good!\" Immediately, it seemed like the scimitar in his hand was blocked. Even his warhorse could not help but repeatedly move back a few steps.</p><br/><p>It was clear to everyone that the His Excellency the Duke only needed to block casually and this already forced the opponent to retreat. That caused the 'Wolf Fang' to issue the sky-shaking cheer again.</p><br/><p>Although Rody was temporarily unable to deploy his 'Domain Power', as a master of 'Domain Power', his skill in controlling the force used was still at its peak. When he used that small trick, naturally nobody saw through it.</p><br/><p>Seth took a deep breath. He still managed to maintain his usual composure. Rody was thinking of advancing again, but Seth thought to himself, 'I will not oblige anymore.' After that, he quickly shouted, \"Enough!\"</p><br/><p>Rody seemed to want to smile but yet did not, as he stopped his action. He then looked at Seth.</p><br/><p>Seth coughed gently and said imposingly, \"Judging by the power of that strike, it was not bad. It cannot be considered as a disgrace to my older sister. As far as I am concerned, you have passed the test.\"</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished speaking, they heard the surrounding people exclaim in admiration. Everybody said that His Excellency the Duke was magnanimous and benevolent.</p><br/><p>With such compliments, even if Seth's face had a thick skin it would feel hot. He then lifted his sword high up and waved it. Soon after, in the midst of cheering, the His Excellency the Duke temporarily exited the scene.</p><br/><p>At noon, twelve guns of salute were simultaneously fired at the four city gates of the Imperial Capital! Since it was the older sister of the marshal of the Empire getting married, the army would naturally do their utmost to liven up the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the entire Imperial Capital was livelier than the wedding of the Emperor, many years ago.</p><br/><p>Marquis Garoline stood in the midst of a group of aristocrats who came to congratulate, feeling somewhat moved.</p><br/><p>To be able to mobilize such a massive activity to conduct the wedding ceremony, it absolutely must have had the permission of His Majesty the Emperor. It was clear that His Majesty was really good to that illegitimate son.</p><br/><p>With regards to the handing over of the military power of the Northern Army, Marquis Garoline was somewhat displeased that day. However, immediately after going home and reflecting on it for the whole night, he felt relieved.</p><br/><p>Currently, the Tulip Family had already re-established their glory. But, so what? Even if his Lionheart Family could grasp the power of a military legion, there would not be too much significance.</p><br/><p>For now, the most important thing was to lie low.</p><br/><p>Judging from various aspects, Marquis Garoline had already been convinced and had conceded defeat. It could also be said that he had given up competing with the Tulip Family.</p><br/><p>Since it was impossible to overwhelm the Tulip Family, then it would be better to abandon that idea and maximize the development of his own family clan.</p><br/><p>The army was already the realm of the Tulip Family. Then, why should he need to fight over that little bit of military power? Would it not be better for him to divert his family focus on other more practical areas?</p><br/><p>As with regards to enticing that Marquis Rody...Hmmm, he had already married the older sister of the Duke of the Tulip Family. Would it still be possible to entice him?</p><br/><p>Old Marquis shook his head and sighed, \"Luck is not with me. This must be the will of God.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Rody, in the midst of the cheering of everyone, carried Nicole, who was dressed in splendid ceremonious attire, out of the main door of the mansion of the Duke of the Tulip Family.</p><br/><p>Nicole's face was flushed red, but her eyes were filled with happiness.</p><br/><p>The five thousand 'Wolf Fang' and the one thousand Imperial Guards cheered. In the midst of the chaotic cheering, Rody firmly hugged Nicole and whispered in her ear, \"I said before, I will use my real identity as Rody and let you honorably become my woman.\"</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he carried Nicole and placed her on the horse. He jumped up and sat behind Nicole. Under the escort of a large number of cavalry, they headed towards his own Marquis Mansion.</p><br/><p>All along the way, numerous rose petals were sprinkled down and covered all of the four miles long of the red carpet. As the hooves of the horse trampled on those petals, Nicole felt so happy and blessed that she almost fainted...</p><br/><p>Far away on the city gate tower, the fat Sky looked at the chaotic cheering crowd in the distance. He sighed and said, \"Oh, what do you want me to say? Shall I say 'Lovers eventually got married\u2019 or 'Rody is a damn lucky fellow'?\"</p><br/><p>Andy swallowed a cup of golden alcoholic liquid. He then licked around his lips, smiled, and said, \"I think this boy is in trouble. To marry a wife, he has already caused such a massive activity. There are a few more in the house. In future, when he marries, one by one, will he not die of exhaustion?\"</p><br/><p>An eccentric voice said angrily, \"What is so good about that boy! It is like 'a stalk of fresh flower stuck into the cow dung'!\" She was Concubine Ruolan.</p><br/><p>Ruolan looked sideways at the two old guys. Ever since she was under house arrest at the Imperial Palace, she had always been by the side of those two guys. In Ruolan's mind, that Emperor of the Radiant Empire was a little strange. That fat warrior was also very weird. The two of them, one was the Emperor while the other was a warrior with terrifying strength. However, they both seemed like lunatics. When there was nobody around, the two would even curse and laugh at each other. It was completely without even a little bit of an Emperor's dignity.</p><br/><p>That fat Sky took a look at Ruolan. In his heart, he felt that this fierce woman somehow seemed decent to him. The way she talked was very pleasant. Even when they quarreled and bickered it was in line with his temperament. He could not help but smile and say, \"Old man, it is about time. I think you, as the host of the wedding, should go there already.\"</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished, he looked at Ruolan again. \"You guy, don't you dislike that boy, Rody? I think you are unable to defeat him. However, you can take advantage of today's wedding and it will not be difficult to get him drunk. Do you dare?\"</p><br/><p>Ruolan opened his eyes and stared. \"Why not? Do you think I will be afraid of that pretty boy?\"</p><br/><p>Fatty patted his huge thighs and said, \"Well, today, if you can get that boy drunk until he crawled, then I will teach you a set of tricks!\"</p><br/><p>Andy gave Sky a cold look and lightly said, \"Very good, if you, Fat Lady, succeed, I will also teach you a top-notch magic.\"</p><br/><p>Ruolan rolled her eyes but said, \"I am not interested in your whatever shit magic. If you give me a few of the beauties in the Palace, then that will be good enough.\"</p><br/><p>With a chuckle, the mouthful of wine that the Old Skeleton just drank, accidentally spurted out. It splashed right on Fatty's face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

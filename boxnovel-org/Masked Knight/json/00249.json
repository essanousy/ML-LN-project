He saw a few Royal Knights arrive looking vigilant. They were looking around carefully as if they were searching for something.</p><br/><p>\"Look.\" Rody gave an eye signal to Mouse.</p><br/><p>Mouse smiled gently and covered her mouth. \"They probably noticed that their horses had gone missing and had come out to look for the horse thief.\" She paused for a moment then explained, \"There is a horse market in the vicinity of the capital. Quite often, there are some horse thieves selling the stolen horses. Those knights who have lost their horses probably are heading there now.\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed and pulled Mouse along. They went to their horses and quietly left the square in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>With their identities, it was naturally not necessary to stealthily run away. However, the two of them felt that it was more interesting to do so. They giggled all the way as they fled on their horses, leaving behind a series of cheerful laughter on the streets. The two of them were having fun and were not prepared when a carriage dashed out obliquely from the corner of a crossroad.</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s horse was frightened when both sides almost crashed into each other. Fortunately, Rody had good riding skills. He forcefully pulled the reins of his horse. The horse reared on its hind legs and neighed.</p><br/><p>Rody had just stopped their horses while the driver of the carriage was seized with terror. Fortunately, he hurriedly stopped the carriage. However, the inertia caused the carriage to be thrown off. It swept sideways on the ground and almost turned over.</p><br/><p>When both sides finally stopped, a voice immediately shouted in rage, \"Bastard! How do you ride your horse?\"</p><br/><p>Before his voice stopped, a whip had already been lashed towards Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody frowned slightly and moved to one side. The whip missed him. Rody did not want to stir up trouble. Besides that, he and Mouse had been running away wildly and carelessly. Because of that, he had almost caused an accident.</p><br/><p>However, the other party was not forgiving. When he saw that Rody was \u2018bold\u2019 enough to escape, he shouted loudly. A few knights in bright armors quickly caught up from behind the carriage. They immediately surrounded Rody and Mouse as they lifted their spears.</p><br/><p>\"What happened? Are you trying to kill me?\" A sharp and harsh roar came from the carriage. The driver immediately rushed to the side of the carriage and respectfully trembled. \"Mi\u2014Miss\u2026It's two 'blind' fellows blocking the way.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\" With a deep, cold harrumph, the voice of that 'Miss' from inside the carriage said, \"Give each person twenty whips. I still need to hurry back.\"</p><br/><p>The driver immediately turned to look at the surrounded Rody and shouted, \"The two of you, listen carefully! Stand there obediently and do not move! Our Miss said to let you go after twenty whips each.\"</p><br/><p>The driver flipped the whip twice. He sneered and walked towards Rody and Mouse. When he approached, he was startled by Mouse\u2019s appearance. He had never seen such a beautiful woman before. He involuntarily showed an infatuated gaze and gave a strange smile. \"That\u2026it is not good to whip such a beautiful young girl. You, boy over there, just you alone will be whipped.\"</p><br/><p>On both sides, the guards who looked like knights moved aside to open up a path. When the driver went up to the front of Rody and saw that Rody was still on his horse, he asked, \"What\u2019s the matter? Do you need me to drag you off the horse?\"</p><br/><p>Mouse\u2019s expression had long sunken. She had always been a proud and indifferent person. Her warm feelings were only towards Rody. She had never shown a nice mien to anyone else. When she saw that the other party was being unreasonable, her eyes had already revealed a little bit of anger. Rody understood that if Mouse really became angry, not just these few Royal Knights but those in the whole capital city would not be able to stop her. He immediately gently grasped Mouse\u2019s hand and shook his head. He then loudly said, \"Just now was our fault. We almost overturned your carriage. We apologize. What else can we do? Besides that, your carriage was also rushing on the main street. Otherwise, we would not have crashed into you. If you really want to point fingers, it is not just our fault only.\"</p><br/><p>\"What impudence!\" The driver had an arrogant expression. \"From your accent, I believe you are not a local! Don\u2019t you even recognize the Senior Prime Minister\u2019s carriage? There is nobody in this whole city who would dare to block this carriage!\" After he finished speaking, he impatiently took his whip and lashed out.</p><br/><p>A tragic cry was heard. Nobody saw how Rody moved but they saw the driver crash to one side. He fell to the ground and rolled a few rounds. After that, he cried loudly as he held his head.</p><br/><p>\"Audacious!\" This time, the one who shouted was a middle-aged knight amongst the few guards. With a gloomy expression, he shouted, \"Seize him!\"</p><br/><p>The knights thrust their spears forward. They did not really want to kill Rody but only wanted to use their spears to force Rody not to move. Rody narrowed his eyes as they became stern.</p><br/><p>Immediately, there was the continuous sound of metal clashing. One by one, the knights cried out in pain. Their spears had broken into two and fell to the ground. Their hands were bleeding. They also did not know what strange method that young Rody was using, as all of their spears were instantly broken and fell on the ground. Those knights only felt a large force come from the spear. Their purlicues felt painful, causing them to involuntarily loosen their grip and drop their spears.</p><br/><p>Rody gently clapped his hands and lightly said, \"Just now, our horses were too fast and collided with you. We have already apologized. Let\u2019s forget it. We are also in a hurry!\" He had earlier heard the other party say something about the \u2018Senior Prime Minister\u2019 and assumed those people to be the Senior Prime Minister\u2019s family members. He allowed some leeway and did not force the issue.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, with Rody\u2019s identity and strength, for them to have actually attacked him, it would not have just ended up with broken weapons only.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! That is a good trick!\" An angry voice came from the carriage. The door was then heavily pushed open and that 'Miss' jumped out from inside the carriage.</p><br/><p>When Rody looked at that 'Miss' in front of him, he was rendered speechless from shock.</p><br/><p>It was nothing, but the appearance of that 'Miss' was weird. She was not dressed in a noblewoman\u2019s clothing but a mighty armor. She also carried a sword.</p><br/><p>Besides that, it was not a slender decorative sword used by nobles. Instead, it was a standard double-edged sword.</p><br/><p>He looked at that 'Miss' again and could not help but wanted to laugh.</p><br/><p>That was not because the woman was ugly. In all fairness, she had fair skin, bright piercing eyes, white teeth and red lips. Her long hair fluttered in the wind.</p><br/><p>However...however, she was too \u2018well developed\u2019.</p><br/><p>Her original pair of bright shining eyes were squeezed on her face into two thin lines. If a person did not look at them carefully, they would not realize that the two thin lines were her eyes. Her straight nose was also squeezed by her fat cheeks until it looked like the bulb of a garlic.</p><br/><p>Her two lips were also bright red and alluring. However, they were somewhat too fat and thick. It was fine if she did not laugh but at that moment, she was sneering...Her smile was terrible. No matter how, it looked like a bloody basin.</p><br/><p>As for her body...one could reluctantly regard it as a body with curves. Unfortunately, it was seven to eight times larger compared to an average woman\u2019s body. If her body were to be divided into seven or eight parts, each separate part could be regarded as graceful.</p><br/><p>As for her waist \u2026 In all fairness, she had no waist. It could be regarded as three or four pails.</p><br/><p>That lady stood in front of Rody\u2019s horse like a mountain of meat. It could not be said that she was too fat. She was barely the size of four to five pigs only.</p><br/><p>As for her age...She was not very old. She was only old enough to be Rody\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>Looking at the mountain of meat in front of him, Rody could not help but sigh. He suddenly admired the carriage driver.</p><br/><p>The carriage was carrying this big 'Miss' and yet he could actually move it so quickly...with only a few horses. Looks like the strength of the ironwood of Roland Continents truly well deserved its reputation.</p><br/><p>As if she felt Rody\u2019s gaze, that 'Miss' shouted, \"What are you looking at?\" She then intimidated Rody by ruthlessly slashing with the broadsword in her hand.</p><br/><p>That sword was not small nor light. At the very least, Rody remembered that among those he knew only the former robust guard of the Tulip Family, Randt, used such a large and heavy broadsword.</p><br/><p>However, such a large broadsword when placed in the hand of that burly 'Miss' was only as small as an embroidery needle.</p><br/><p>Rody immediately looked away. Because of his former appearance, Rody would never mock another person for their peculiar appearance. He cleared his throat and nodded his head from on top of his horse. \"We were in a hurry and accidentally crashed into your carriage. Let me apologize first. Everybody is busy. I hope Miss will not pursue this anymore...As for your men's broken weapons, I am willing to compensate.\" After that, Rody's hand reached into his bosom.</p><br/><p>However, he did not get anything. He did not have any gold coins with him. He had already used the few gold coins from the Empire to buy the flowers that morning. Right now, he was also unable to secretly pinch a few gold pieces out of the gold coins.</p><br/><p>That 'Miss' saw Rody\u2019s awkward expression and immediately knew his thoughts. She then laughed. Rody smiled wryly and said, \"I did not bring any money with me. Are you from the Senior Prime Minister\u2019s home? I will send the money there later.\"</p><br/><p>\"State your name! Sire! You have wounded my men! I challenge you in accordance with the tradition of the Roland knights!\" The woman\u2019s voice was low, but it could not conceal her arrogance. \"I am the daughter of the Prime Minister of Sauron Kingdom. My name is Rulan.\"</p><br/><p>Rulan?</p><br/><p>With great effort, Rody suppressed the urge to laugh.</p><br/><p>A large and rough murderous woman of over forty years of age holding a broadsword that was only used by robust men said her name was Rulan...</p><br/><p>Rody frowned and softly said, \"Miss Rulan, we have accidentally collided with you. I suggest we forget about it...His Excellency the Senior Prime Minister and I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Mouse had become impatient. With her identity, she was not bothered even if they were the Senior of Junior Prime Minister. Even the King had to be polite to her. When had she ever have to accept such annoying people? She groaned with annoyance and coldly said, \"It is just an accident. You all were being unreasonable first! Are the people from the Sauron Kingdom capital so bossy?\"</p><br/><p>The moment Mouse spoke, she immediately attracted the attention of Rulan. Rulan was dazzled for a moment. She looked at the charming woman who was somewhat angry in front of her. However, Mouse\u2019s anger could not conceal her beauty.</p><br/><p>Miss Rulan's eyes lit up. Her eyes showed that she was clearly bewitched. Her expression became somewhat wretched and looked like a pig\u2019s.</p><br/><p>With her beauty Mouse was used to this kind of look from men who saw her. However, at that moment, these eyes and expressions came from a woman. For some reason, Mouse suddenly felt chilly.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Rulan did not even conceal the swallowing of her saliva as she glared at Mouse. She took a deep breath and gave a strange smile. \"I did not expect that the capital still has such a woman\u2026Hmph, how about this, if you were to give me this woman, I will spare you your life.\"</p><br/><p>Those words made Rody dumbstruck. If it were an ordinary noble having such wicked thoughts after seeing a beautiful woman, it would still be considered normal. However, that 'Miss' seemed to be fond of women.</p><br/><p>Mouse\u2019s eyes quivered in anger and she had already clenched her fist. From Rody's understanding of her that the Black Veiled Saint was on the verge of throwing a fireball and blast away the lascivious woman.</p><br/><p>Rody coldly shouted, \"Senseless!\"</p><br/><p>Rody no longer wanted to bother with the other party. He coldly looked at Rulan and pulled the reins of his horse to leave. With his strength, she would not be able to stop him.</p><br/><p>\"Stop!\" Rulan shouted. She looked at Rody and Mouse with her squinted eyes then looked at the horses that they were riding. Suddenly, her eyes lit up and she smiled. \"From your accent, you are not locals. However, your horses are clearly the Royal Knight\u2019s warhorses! Speak quickly, where did these horses come from? The law of the Sauron Kingdom states that only royalty and the Royal Knights are allowed to ride on these horses. You are probably not from the Royal Family! Otherwise, I would have recognized you!\" She then laughed coldly and said, \"Just now, I saw the Royal Knights in front doing a search. Is it related to you?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, about ten cavalrymen wearing the armor of the Royal Knights rode quickly towards them and neatly jumped off their horses.</p><br/><p>Rody felt awkward. That was because he thought that the other party was looking for the horse thieves...Although he was not afraid of them, he would still lose face if they found out that the dignified envoy of the Empire had stolen their horses.</p><br/><p>However, the knights did not even spare Rody a glance. The leader of those knights bowed to Rulan and respectfully said, \"Your Royal Highness the Consort, His Majesty has ordered for you to return quickly. Tonight, there will be a banquet at the palace to entertain some honored guests. You must be present.\"</p><br/><p>Consort?</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s eyes opened wide.</p><br/><p>Was she the daughter of the Senior Prime Minister, the Consort?</p><br/><p>Was she really the King's wife?</p><br/><p>For the first time in his life, Rody finally felt admiration and sympathy for the King.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

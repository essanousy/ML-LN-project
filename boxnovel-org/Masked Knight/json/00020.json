On the other hand, Andy was standing quietly at one side.</p><br/><p>After some time, Andy said, \u201cPerhaps you want to take off the mask? Do you know that there are a lot of people in this world who would want to get their hands on this thing? Why do you seem so unwilling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmmm?\" Hearing these words, Rody's heart stirred. Perhaps this unlucky \u2018God's Smile' had more secrets to it.</p><br/><p>Andy lazily said to himself, \u201cYou don't look stupid. How did Master\u2019s mask end up being passed to you? Master once said that whoever obtained this mask would be able to inherit his wisdom! But you\u2026 you don\u2019t seem to appreciate it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Its voice was lazy but when its words reached Rody\u2019s ears, it was earth-shattering!</p><br/><p>Dandong\u2019s wisdom!!!</p><br/><p>Rody immediately stood up and shouted, \u201cYou\u2026 did you say\u2026 Dandong\u2019s wisdom?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Andy suddenly burst into laughter. The sound of his laughter sounded creepy in the middle of the night. Without bold courage, most people who were unlike Rody would have already fainted if they saw a skeleton laughing heartily.</p><br/><p>Rody could not help but ask loudly, \u201cHow could this be? Why does obtaining this mask mean being able to obtain Dandong\u2019s wisdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Andy stopped laughing and asked back, \u201cWhy do I need to tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Rody was stumped for words.</p><br/><p>Andy simply continued on its own. \u201cMm... Based on what Master has told me, if you want to get an answer from me and I am unwilling to tell you, you can only use coercion and cajolery\u2026 Mmm, something about people using force to threaten other people and something like torture\u2026 but you are too weak. I can defeat you with one finger... it seems that method is impossible for you\u2026 hmm\u2026 there is also lying and deceiving me into giving you an answer\u2026 But you don\u2019t look that smart either\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words made Rody\u2019s face turn red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want so that you are willing to tell me the secrets?\u201d</p><br/><p>Andy asked back, \u201cWhy do you want Master\u2019s wisdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question made Rody freeze for a moment.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>Dandong's wisdom and heritage were priceless. With Dandong's wisdom, there would be many earth-shaking discoveries.</p><br/><p>But what do these have to do with an ordinary commoner like him?</p><br/><p>Subconsciously, Rody knew that Dandong\u2019s wisdom was very important and must definitely be discovered. However, he never thought about what to do with Dandong\u2019s wisdom after its discovery.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Rody thought for a long time and finally gave a wry smile, \u201cAt the very least, I can find a way to take off this mask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing this sentence, Rody looked at Andy with hope.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a clear and crisp knock on the door.</p><br/><p>Rody was shocked and subconsciously looked at the door. He was not checking for ghosts but if someone saw him talking to a skeleton, nothing good would come of it!</p><br/><p>When Rody turned back to look at Andy, he found Andy already standing quietly at its original corner, motionless. It was like how Rody had first seen it on the first day.</p><br/><p>The skeleton looked completely lifeless as it should!</p><br/><p>Rody sighed in relief. He knew that Andy did not want others to discover its existence. Rody cleared his throat and shouted loudly, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>A respectful voice answered from outside, \u201cYoung Master, it is me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, the door opened and an old man with gray hair walked in.</p><br/><p>The old man looked somewhat familiar. Rody finally remembered. This old man was the one on Miss Nicole\u2019s carriage that he and Star had attacked that night.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, that Rody was in such a predicament today was also partly the fault of this old groom.</p><br/><p>That night, Nicole had told him to pick someone to carry home. Of all the people on the ground, the old man decided to grab Star who was the furthest away from him.</p><br/><p>As a result, Rody got desperate and broke into the Tulip Family\u2019s home before being captured by Miss Nicole.</p><br/><p>Thus, Rody decided to show a somewhat unfriendly face.</p><br/><p>The old groom, Old Mark, did not care about Rody\u2019s expression and bowed respectfully, \u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s dawn. The lady has asked me to bring you over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is dawn?\u201d Rody was shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s already dawn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\" Old Mark, while still a maintaining respectful form, glanced at the table that was cut into seven or eight pieces by Rody and the messy floor.</p><br/><p>Rody felt somewhat embarrassed and said, \u201cThis is... last night I was practicing swordplay and accidentally\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Mark did not bat an eye. He said in the same tone as before, \"Master, you must be tired after practicing throughout the night. I will ask the others to help clean this up. Follow me to see Miss Nicole for now. If you are late\u2026 I am afraid it would not bring you any good.\"</p><br/><p>Rody sighed. Since Nicole called him, he would not dare to delay.</p><br/><p>Without a choice, he followed Old Mark out of the room.</p><br/><p>Once he walked out of the door, he looked back at Andy to find the skeleton secretly lifting his hand to wave goodbye.</p><br/><p>This skeleton!</p><br/><p>The sky was indeed starting to turn bright. However, it was still not quite sunrise yet. Rody honestly did not know why Nicole had called for him so early in the morning. Perhaps the whole family liked to get up early?</p><br/><p>Nicole's bedroom was upstairs, above the room Rody had slept in that day, Seth's bedroom. It was in the biggest most well-designed building in the luxurious complex.</p><br/><p>Old Mark brought Rody to Nicole\u2019s bedroom. He knocked on the door before stepping back to stand behind Rody.</p><br/><p>Someone inside the room immediately and gently opened the door.</p><br/><p>A maid was standing at the doorway. When she saw Rody, she immediately bowed and greeted Rody, \u201cYoung Master.\u201d After that, she moved aside to make way for Old Mark and Rody.</p><br/><p>Rody put on a brave front and entered the room.</p><br/><p>Nicole\u2019s room was slightly smaller than Seth\u2019s room but the decorations in the room were more refined. Especially the elegant jewelry and the other small ornaments on the dressing table. These gave the room a softer mood.</p><br/><p>Nicole was not in the room but was behind a screen in the corner of the room. Her voice came from behind, \u201cStay there and wait! Wait for me to come out and talk to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind the screen, a maid was attending to Nicole, helping her to get dressed. She stood behind Nicole to help her fasten the complicated ribbons and buttons.</p><br/><p>Rody could not help but look at the screen. Although he was separated by the screen and could not really see anything, he could still see the shadows from behind the screen. The sexy silhouette of a young girl changing clothes made Rody\u2019s heart accelerate.</p><br/><p>He suddenly had a strange thought. It would be great if I could see through that screen.</p><br/><p>As soon as that thought passed, Rody felt his eyes become brighter. After that, the screen in front of him immediately turned transparent.</p><br/><p>What just happened?</p><br/><p>Before he was even surprised, the sexy scene behind the screen had firmly grabbed Rody\u2019s gaze!</p><br/><p>Behind the screen, Nicole\u2019s beautiful golden hair was being tied up as the maid helped her put on a skirt. Nicole was also only in her undergarments. That bold and unrestrained figure almost made Rody\u2019s eyes pop out. Nicole bent over and her whole body formed a graceful curve that looked like a deformed \u2018S\u2019 shape. She looked stunning, especially when you consider her long legs, slender waist and most importantly, her full bosom.</p><br/><p>Rody could not help but gently cried out, \"Ah.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

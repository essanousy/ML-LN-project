He had long expected to encounter them so that if he were to encounter them earlier, the earlier it would be solved, and he would not have to worry about it every day.</p><br/><p>His opponent seemed to only be a Paladin, a group of Holy Knights and a few sorcerers.</p><br/><p>Although he had lost his strength, dealing with the ordinary knights would not be a problem. On top of that, the Black Veil Saint and Old Mark, both of whom were powerful, were present. It would not be too difficult to break through them.</p><br/><p>Rody absolutely did not expect himself to be so wrong.</p><br/><p>Arslan finally had the appearance of a Paladin this day. She was no longer sneaky, like in the past. She pointed her sword to the front and shouted a phrase.</p><br/><p>What made Rody surprised was that he could not understand Arslan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The only one who understood it was Sith.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2026it is the dragon language!\" Sith was shocked and loudly shouted, \"Be careful of those Holy Knights! They are all dragons!\"</p><br/><p>The three hundred knights gave an earth-shattering roar. That roar was like a mighty force. The knights pointed their weapons at their enemies. Their horses stepped forward in unison and the troop of knights gradually approached.</p><br/><p>Arslan\u2019s heart felt perplexed.</p><br/><p>After the dragons started to support the Temple, four dragon Paladins and some dragon warriors that had been dispatched were killed by Rody. Other than those, Arslan had brought out all these others.</p><br/><p>These knights were dragon warriors. A common dragon had a dragon\u2019s body. However, those that could transform into human-like figures were high-ranked dragons. At that place, all of the knights were stronger than the average human knights. The dragons being powerful was not just an empty statement.</p><br/><p>These people were all loyal to Arslan. King Sauron plotting against Paladin Fielding and the Elders also relied on these people. Arslan felt helpless as she understood that her opponent was powerful. There was the Black Veil Saint and also Rody, whom she feared. She had no choice but to go all out from the start.</p><br/><p>The dragon warriors roared powerfully. It became even more imposing and some even had a murderous aura. It made the Sauron Kingdom\u2019s Royal Knights step a few steps back in fear.</p><br/><p>Arslan roared, \"Kill!\"</p><br/><p>The three hundred knights that had been approaching gradually began to sprint.</p><br/><p>\"Prepare for battle\u2026\" The commander of the Royal Knights was very conscientious. He had already given the order aloud but before he could finish his sentence, he suddenly felt his neck turned cold. Whatever words he still had could no longer be spoken.</p><br/><p>A wind blade had cut off his head. Its remaining strength made it cut through the armor of the knight behind him. Half of his arm was cut and badly mangled.</p><br/><p>They saw that the three hundred dragon warriors were still hundreds of meters away. There were dense flashes of light. The dragon warriors holding swords shot out numerous wind blades and light blades.</p><br/><p>'What the hell? These guys are actually so strong?'</p><br/><p>Rody was shocked. To send out wind blades or light blades, a person would need to have the military skill of a high-ranked warrior. The enemies that were quickly approaching obviously had such strength.</p><br/><p>Rody drew his scimitar. He did not look at the Royal Knight that had perished on duty and shouted in a deep voice, \"Fall into formation!\"</p><br/><p>However, it was too late. The attacks had reached Rody\u2019s formation and tragic cries could be heard. Many Royal Knights were struck and fell off their horses, dying tragically. The troops were thrown into confusion.</p><br/><p>There was a snap as the roof of the carriage was smashed by a light blade. Old Mark jumped up from the position of the driver. He carried Seth with one hand and jumped towards the rear.</p><br/><p>The magic waves filled the sky. The sorcerers took turns attacking. A thunderous sound was then heard. The man wearing red robes, the Red Clothed Saint, held a ball of light with both of his hands. The ball of light was almost as bright as the sun. He then smashed it down.</p><br/><p>'Shit!'</p><br/><p>Before Rody could say anything, a black figure from the carriage flew towards the sky. The Black Veil Saint put her hand on her chest. She created a defensive wall with her sorcery and sent it towards the large ball of light.</p><br/><p>A thunderous roar could be heard in the sky. The explosion brought a glaring light to the eyes of the people. The violent wind even caused the Royal Knights to have trouble sitting tight on their horses.</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint in the air chanted. She spun her body quickly in the air and sent out a black tornado towards the sorcerers of the Temple in the distance.</p><br/><p>The charging dragon warriors had almost reached the front. These tough fellows were not affected by the explosion in the sky and did not even close their eyes under the glaring light.</p><br/><p>The first row of Royal Knights had immediately engaged with the enemy but was broken through as easily as paper. The Royal Knights were unable to withstand the dragon warrior's attacks. One after another, they were hacked to death along with their horses.</p><br/><p>Chaos!</p><br/><p>The remaining Royal Knights fought back against the people from the Temple. However, the screams continued as the number of Royal Knights dwindled rapidly. The Black Veil Saint continued to battle with the sorcerers in the sky.</p><br/><p>Sith also flew to the sky. He seized an opportunity to fight at the periphery, throwing a light ball to the Temple\u2019s sorcerers from time to time. The joint efforts of Sith and Mouse gradually pushed back the Temple\u2019s sorcerers and the Red Clothed Saint. There were constant explosions and bright lights in the sky.</p><br/><p>Rody had just blocked the sword in front of him when he heard a sorrowful cry from the horse under him. He immediately jumped off the horse and saw that a light blade had cut off the hooves of the horse.</p><br/><p>Two swords then came from both his sides. Rody quickly retreated and leaned on the broken carriage. He gritted his teeth and blocked the attacks.</p><br/><p>After two clashes, Rody\u2019s arm became a little numb. He had used his fighting energy this time thinking he could disarm his opponents. However, the two dragon warriors simply grunted and retreated a few steps back. They still held firmly to their weapons.</p><br/><p>\"Earl Rody!\" Arslan\u2019s voice was heard. She had already rushed into the tangled battle. Her long and thin sword stabbed forward lightly as she cried out and appeared in front of Rody in a short moment.</p><br/><p>\"Please\u2026\" the beautiful dragon Paladin said in a low voice, \"go and die!\"</p><br/><p>Her snake-like sword reached in front of Rody. He quickly moved sideways, and the sword stabbed into the carriage behind him. Bang! The carriage fell apart and its broken parts flew out. Rody felt a severe pain on his shoulder. He took a glance and saw that the armor on his shoulder and his clothes were torn. Faint sword marks started to appear.</p><br/><p>'I have actually started to bleed!'</p><br/><p>'Looks like my current strength is really weak. If it was at that time, the Paladin\u2019s attacks would not even hurt me.'</p><br/><p>Arslan\u2019s earlier attack could clearly be seen in Rody\u2019s eyes. If it was in the past, it would not even be a problem to counter this attack.</p><br/><p>Although Rody had dodged earlier, his body\u2019s reaction was already not good enough. The sword even managed to harm him.</p><br/><p>Arslan had a murderous expression. Blood slowly dripped from the sword point. Her body disappeared at that point. Rody\u2019s heart tensed up. He then instantly felt a cold blade thrust from behind him.</p><br/><p>Rody gave a backhand swing. His attack was fruitless as it was blocked by his opponent. Instead, Rody himself felt like he was electrocuted as he flew sideways.</p><br/><p>\"How did you become so weak?\" Arslan\u2019s voice was cold but a little surprised.</p><br/><p>What was originally the most terrifying enemy had suddenly become weak.</p><br/><p>Ruolan\u2019s sword had split a dragon warrior into two halves. Blood splashed all over her face. She heard Rody\u2019s groan and suddenly remembered her task. She turned to see Rody sent flying away by Arslan. She sneered, and her huge body charged towards Arslan at an incredible pace.</p><br/><p>Arslan had underestimated the enemy.</p><br/><p>She initially did not expect her opponent to be so powerful. She had lightly waved her sword. The Royal Knights were too weak in her opinion and nobody could withstand her attack. However, when their swords clashed, Arslan groaned. Her long and thin sword had bent over. A tyrannical force had immediately pushed over and moved towards her body.</p><br/><p>\"Who are you?\" Arslan was forced to take two steps back to confront her powerful enemy.</p><br/><p>Ruolan saw Arslan\u2019s cool expression turn into a startled expression. She then grinned and smiled, \"Little beauty, when I capture you and take you back, I will slowly tell you!\"</p><br/><p>As soon as she said that, she swung her huge sword.</p><br/><p>Arslan became so angry that her face turned blue.</p><br/><p>She knew she was beautiful. However, with her strength and status, she had never been teased in such a wretched tone. No one dared to call her a \u2018little beauty\u2019.</p><br/><p>The two figures, one fat and one thin, could be seen clashing against each other. Ding! Ding! Dang! Dang! The sounds of their weapons clashed; the sounds were so close that it sounded like the rain. As the light and shadows interlocked, the two suddenly shouted loudly at the same time. Boom! A burst of light flashed, and the two figures backed off. Ruolan\u2019s face was black and Arslan had turned pale.</p><br/><p>Arslan\u2019s sword trembled slightly in her hands. She then held the sword with both hands. On the other hand, Ruolan had already held her sword with her other hand.</p><br/><p>The first battle the two had with each other ended up as a tie.</p><br/><p>Rody struggled to get up but several dragon warriors had already surrounded him. They slashed at him at the same time. Rody cursed as he waved his sword in an arc. A light blade burst forth and whistled. The circular arc of light forced the enemies around him to retreat.</p><br/><p>Nedis hid amongst the crowd using her vampire race\u2019s Blood Escape as she looked for an opportunity to attack sneakily.</p><br/><p>Old Mark guarded Seth with one hand and fought back the surrounding dragon warriors with his other hand.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the Royal Knights had almost been completely annihilated. The remaining one or two stronger ones were sooner or later surrounded by even more dragon warriors and killed.</p><br/><p>Old Mark needed to protect Seth and the actions he could take were limited. He cursed as his sword changed into a huge light. He jumped up and slashed down.</p><br/><p>There was a loud sound. A large fissure appeared on the ground. There were three dragon warriors who could not dodge in time and were cut into pieces.</p><br/><p>Seth who was being held and protected by Old Mark softly whispered out commands. \"Left, right\u2026left\u2026left\u2026There are fewer people on the left.\"</p><br/><p>Rody had fervently defended for a while but was soon struck from all directions. Fortunately, these dragon warriors were much weaker than Arslan. Although the attacks struck Rody\u2019s body, it was not able to hurt him. It only gave him a little pain.</p><br/><p>Rody ignored their attacks and only focused on protecting his head. He spent the rest of his time slashing wildly at his enemy as though he had gone mad. However, they soon got used to his movements and started fighting more carefully. Other than the first three or four individuals, Rody was not able to cause any more heavy damage.</p><br/><p>Instead, his body suffered from more attacks. Although he was not injured, he had almost lost consciousness from the pain.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Mouse gave a cry of anger in the sky. Her hands slowly drew a circle.</p><br/><p>The originally sunny sky quickly filled with dark clouds filled with lightning. Mouse floated in the sky, her robes fluttering, and stretched out slender her hands as if guiding the Gods.</p><br/><p>Boom! A lightning struck at the enemy sorcerers...</p><br/><p>The Red Clothed Saint was a middle-aged man. He smiled coldly and shouted, \"Get ready!\"</p><br/><p>He ignored the other sorcerers at the back. He turned his body and faced the lightning as he dashed towards it. It was vaguely visible. He was holding a huge and almost completely transparent disc.</p><br/><p>Boom! The lightning struck the disc in his hand, but the transparent disc was like a mirror. When the lightning struck it, it was deflected towards Mouse.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

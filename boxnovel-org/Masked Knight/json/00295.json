This would cut off their combat effectiveness.</p><br/><p>Yukinari had already been misled by Nedis to believe that the person handling the front lines, Kumu Yu, was an enemy.</p><br/><p>Kumu Yu was treated unjustly. He actually did not have any alliance with Nobunaga. However, Nedis' guess was quite accurate at the fact that Kumu Yu did not think highly of the playboy, Yukinari. If the person giving him orders was Koichi, he might have immediately responded. However, Kumu Yu did not feel happy with the weak playboy giving him orders. On top of that, the Roland Army was approaching and could be used as an excuse to delay. Once a winner between Nobunaga and the playboy emerged, he would be able to return with a high position and be greatly valued.</p><br/><p>Although he did not have any intention of rebelling, his action of using the troops to maintain his importance was accurately guessed by Nedis. By instigating a little she had confused Yukinari.</p><br/><p>Yukinari hesitated for a moment when he was told to cut off the supplies to Kumu Yu. After all, he was an indecisive person. He felt that this was inappropriate and said, \"This\u2026should I summon the other officers and ask for their opinion? Perhaps I should discuss this with Hideyoshi\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\" Nedis grunted. This could not be discussed. Yukinari might be an idiot but his subordinates might not necessarily be idiots! Especially Hideyoshi. He seemed to really quite clever. Nedis' lies might not be able to get past them.</p><br/><p>\"Young Master Yukinari!\" Nedis boldly said, \"I think you should change your character! You are no longer the young man people despise! You are now the Shogun of the Dwarven Kingdom! You are the leader of the Dwarven Kingdom! You do not need to discuss everything with your subordinates! As a leader, you need to sometimes be resolute! You need to be dictatorial! Think of how your father did it last time. Was he always afraid to do anything and discuss with his subordinates first?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari lowered his head. After a while, he became spirited again and showed an excited expression. \"Yes! I will immediately give the order!\"</p><br/><p>He then straightened his back and loudly shouted for someone to come.</p><br/><p>A voice replied from outside and then the sliding door opened. A young warrior stood in the doorway and asked, \"Shogun, do you have any instructions?\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari put on a majestic appearance, but his eyes still showed his anxiety. \"Have the supplies been sent out to Kumu Yu on the frontlines?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not yet!\" The warrior did not dare to raise his head. He respectfully said, \"You have already inquired about this yesterday. The supplies have already been prepared and loaded. It is ready to move out tonight.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good!\" Yukinari waved his hand and then said, \"Pass my orders that all these are to be returned to the treasury! Not a single arrow or a piece of grain is to be shipped out!\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" The warrior lifted his head from shock and said, \"But\u2026Shogun\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari wanted to explain himself but then he saw Nedis' agitated expression. He immediately raised his eyebrow and shouted, \"Bastard! My words are my orders! Do you dare to defy my order?\"</p><br/><p>\"No\u2026no\u2026\" The warrior hurriedly replied, \"But this is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Yukinari somehow gathered his courage. He strode forward and slammed down both of his hands. The two loud sounds frightened the warrior and he immediately lowered his head. His body stood perfectly straight and he no longer dared to speak.</p><br/><p>Yukinari then shouted, \"After passing my orders, do not speak wantonly! Now go and pass my orders! If you delay this matter, I will have you commit seppuku!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Yes!\" The warrior then hurried away.</p><br/><p>Yukinari trembled from excitement. That earlier feeling made him unable to help himself from trembling.</p><br/><p>This is the feeling of a Shogun! This is the feeling of power! The ultimate power allowing you to manipulate others!</p><br/><p>It feels great!</p><br/><p>Since young, Yukinari had never felt so great in his life. He was originally looked down and treated as a playboy. Even if he was the Shogun's son, when he meets the other generals, it was only to the degree of being subservient. After being instigated by Nedis, he now felt a proud and elated feeling.</p><br/><p>He turned to look at Nedis with genuine gratitude. He felt that the beautiful woman in front of him was the person that had treated him the best in his life.</p><br/><p>\"Miss Nedis!\" Yukinari's voice still trembled from feeling touched. \"I do not know how to thank you\u2026How about this, just say something. If I can do it, I will give it to you!\"</p><br/><p>Nedis laughed and replied, \"Shogun Yukinari, you do not need to be so polite. I would already be very satisfied if you gave me the exclusive rights to trade ironwood.\"</p><br/><p>She had calmly said \u2018Shogun Yukinari'. This made Yukinari feel even more joyful. He was so excited that he felt muddle-headed and could not help but say, \"How about this, I am so grateful to you. How about you be my, the Shogun's wife, in the future! I will repay you with all my strength and you can also always be by my side to pull me up!\"</p><br/><p>These words had disturbed the hornet's nest. Nedis' smile instantly disappeared. Her expression became ice-cold. She cursed in a soft voice and kicked Yukinari.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"What did you say?\" Oda Nobunaga was in a warrior's costume. He was sitting cross-legged on a couch. His coat was open, revealing his hairy chest. A long and shiny katana was by his knees. </p><br/><p>In front of him was an officer who was standing. That officer had just given a report that made Nobunaga unable to sit still.</p><br/><p>\"Is what you said true?\" Nobunaga's expression was gloomy. He suddenly stood up and took out his katana with one hand. He then roared and slashed downwards.</p><br/><p>A long table in front of him was split into two. Nobunaga became angrier and angrier as he shouted, \"Has that young Kikukawa gone mad? He actually dared to cut off the supplies to the frontlines?\"</p><br/><p>Nobunaga had received this report from the spies in River Home. He found out that the supplies Yukinari had planned to send to the frontlines had been kept back.</p><br/><p>Nobunaga cursed, \"That idiot's mind is broken! Does he not know that we would all be doomed once Kumu Yu's forces at the frontlines collapses and the Roland Army comes in? He is digging his own grave!\"</p><br/><p>He breathed heavily from his agitation. His looked as though he was thinking strenuously. Finally, he gritted his teeth fiercely and said, \"Pass down my orders. Assemble the army!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" The officer immediately replied and ran out.</p><br/><p>Nobunaga's breath slowed down. His eyes turned murderous.</p><br/><p>'Hmph. Kikukawa Yukinari. I initially thought of letting you live for a few days but then you did something so preposterous. Do not blame me for being merciless!'</p><br/><p>Nobunaga was a wise person. He could immediately see the terrible consequences of Yukinari's actions. He had not immediately gone ahead to kill Yukinari after recruiting soldiers because he knew that the biggest problem was the Roland Army invading from the South. He was not bothered by the internal problem known as Yukinari.</p><br/><p>Until now, Nobunaga still had not immediately sent troops to kill Yukinari. This was because he thought of the foreign enemies. He wanted to wait for the foreign danger to the removed before dealing with the internal problems. If he were to fight against Yukinari, Kumu Yu may not be able to hold out on the frontlines. At that time, everyone would be killed by the Roland Army.</p><br/><p>On top of that, the supplies being sent to the frontlines came from River Home that was under Yukinari's control. Nobunaga would be happy to remain at the back and expand his army. However, Yukinari's stupid actions had destroyed all of Nobunaga's plans.</p><br/><p>Nobunaga immediately thought that Kumu Yu would be immediately routed without supplies. When the Roland Army's knights and chariots dive straight in, even his army would not be a worthy adversary.</p><br/><p>'I have not dealt with him because I considered the entire situation! I was thinking of dealing with the foreign elements first! Does he think I am afraid of his 'Maruyuki'? Hmph! What a joke!'</p><br/><p>'But this idiot had to suddenly do something foolish!'</p><br/><p>'There is no choice. I can only risk it and destroy Yukinari first! Once I occupy River Home, I can support the frontlines and drive away the Roland Army. The dwarf kingdom would then belong to me!'</p><br/><p>'All that is left is Kumu Yu. I still understand him. He is not someone who is ambitious. He is just taking this opportunity to gain some benefits. Since I have major plans, there must be some tolerance! A leader must tolerate those that are difficult to tolerate!'</p><br/><p>'Hmph!'</p><br/><p>Nobunaga heard the sound of the army outside and stopped daydreaming. He immediately dressed neatly and then grabbed his katana. He walked out of the room and loudly shouted, \"Bring me my horse!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi was wrapped in yarn cloth, but he still looked very spirited. He did not show any agony on his face. He straightened his body and brought his subordinates around River Home mobilizing the defenses.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi always had high aspirations. He was initially a warrior without a successful career. He was confident in his strength and will. Besides that, he was also prestigious amongst the other warriors that were out of luck at the River Home market. Many people respected him and lots of people were willing to follow him.</p><br/><p>He had not expected the opportunity to come so quickly.</p><br/><p>He was suddenly recruited by the Kikukawa Family. At that time, Hideyoshi had thought of joining the Kikukawa Family and become recognized for his skills in the future. He did not expect God to play a trick on him.</p><br/><p>In a single night, the powerful Kikukawa Family was destroyed.</p><br/><p>'It was a natural disaster! The Shogun is dead! The Royal Family are dead! Kyoto is also destroyed! The ideal life I had for following the Young Master Yukinari is also finished!'</p><br/><p>'This Young Master Yukinari is also not a respectable person. Although he is my master, he is a bungling oaf without ability. He is cowardly and indecisive. He would soon be killed by Nobunaga.'</p><br/><p>However, Hideyoshi suddenly changed his thoughts. 'Isn't this an opportunity? An incompetent master would allow me to work from within! If I take this opportunity to obtain power, I would be able to rise above others! In the past few days, Yukinari trusts me more and more. He accepts and complies with the suggestions I give him.' Hideyoshi had spared no effort to help Yukinari. This was because it would be easier to get promoted under such a master.</p><br/><p>'Perhaps even one day, once I become fully fledged\u2026Hahaha\u2026'</p><br/><p>Every time Hideyoshi thought of this, his eyes showed a clear trace of ambition.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi had also thought of betraying Yukinari and then joining Nobunaga. However, Nobunaga was too smart. Nobunaga was also the Commander of the cavalry and would naturally have his own trusted officers. 'If I go there, it would be difficult to be placed in an important position. I might as well stay here. Yukinari depends on me so much I am pretty much the second-in-command already!'</p><br/><p>However, Hideyoshi immediately panicked when he heard the reports of the men that night.</p><br/><p>'Has Yukinari gone mad? He has given such a ridiculous order! Does he not know that we are all living steadily here because Kumu Yu is resisting against the Roland Army outside?'</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi ignored the pain in his body and hurried to the temporary Shogunate to see the Shogun, Yukinari.</p><br/><p>The guards did not stop him. They knew that this warrior was Yukinari's favorite. Hideyoshi walked with large strides in the courtyard. He walked in without waiting for the people to announce his arrival.</p><br/><p>'This is something urgent!'</p><br/><p>It was at night. The moonlight was bright as the night breeze blew gently. Although Yukinari had no ability, it had to be admitted that he was very elegant. Even the layout of the courtyard of the temporary Shogunate was very sentimental.</p><br/><p>There was a small pond. Yukinari liked to watch the moon quietly next to it. It seems that it was the only time every day when he could let go of the worries in his heart.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi knew of Yukinari's habit and immediately went there. However, Yukinari was not around.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi then saw another scene. There was a slender figure at the pondside with plum blossoms and enchanting moonlight.</p><br/><p>The night breeze caused her clothes to flutter. The moonlight colored her hair silver.</p><br/><p>She sat by the pond like a sculpture. The pond water rippled by her feet. The night breeze blew as red petals scattered onto the water. Her beautiful legs refused to move together with the water.</p><br/><p>She had a lonely expression as she looked at the distant dark blue sky. Her eyes seemed sad as she sighed, hiding her frustration.</p><br/><p>Her sigh made Hideyoshi's thirty-year-old heart suddenly twitch.</p><br/><p>But then, Hideyoshi suddenly saw another person. It was a man.</p><br/><p>The beautiful woman that made his heart move had sighed. The bitterness in her eyes was all for that man.</p><br/><p>The man looked very young and had an angular face. He did not smile and looked very calm.</p><br/><p>He was extremely tall \u2013 that was, by the dwarven race's standards.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi was in a trance for a moment. He then recognized the two people. These two were the people that came to the River Home together with Yukinari to recruit him.</p><br/><p>The man's appearance had not changed. However, he had become much taller. On his waist was a strange curved sword. Hideyoshi looked at the curved sword for about two seconds before the other party looked over.</p><br/><p>It was awe-inspiring gaze filled with an intangible oppression. At that moment, Hideyoshi became dazzled and lowered his head. It seemed as though he did not dare look at the person face-to-face.</p><br/><p>As a warrior, Hideyoshi was very familiar with this kind of imposing aura. The aura is kind of faint yet impossible to defy! People with this aura are often used to commanding. They are used to giving orders and are accustomed to controlling the life and death of others.</p><br/><p>In front of such a person, Hideyoshi suddenly felt extremely small and unable to defy.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Hideyoshi's instincts as a warrior allowed him to understand that this aura was definitely not something obtained from birth. It was something that was forged over corpses.</p><br/><p>In fact, that night, Rody and Nedis did not intend to go to the courtyard and meet each other.</p><br/><p>Rody felt strange and simply went to the courtyard to take a breather. Nedis had secretly followed him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Rody stand at the edge of the pool and was seemingly in a trance, Nedis smiled and walked over.</p><br/><p>The little vampire Nedis had special feelings for the man named Rody.</p><br/><p>The first time they met, Rody was not baffled by her charm. In front of a crowd, he mercilessly slapped her backside. That bitter experience still had Nedis feeling agitated when she remembered it.</p><br/><p>Another time, she and Darke had been trapped by a vampire. Both of them had almost died. However, Rody calmly came out from the woods. He looked very calm and had an imposing manner that seemingly held everything in contempt. What made Nedis shocked was that Rody easily made the other vampire burn. That spirit made Nedis unable to forget his figure.</p><br/><p>She obviously knew that he was Miss Nicole's lover, but she could no longer keep him out of her mind.</p><br/><p>After that, they met again in the Roland Continent...She then secretly followed him onto the boat. During the days she hid in his cabin, she could feel that Rody had a strange hatred for vampires... Since young, she had never met any man who was not attracted to her. However, while being stuck with her in the hold of the ship cabin for a few days, this guy had a cold indifference towards her from the beginning until the end.</p><br/><p>Later that night, a battle had broken out at the ocean. He had held her with one arm and broken through the explosive blaze unhindered. Nobody could stop him. On that battlefield, he was like an invincible God.</p><br/><p>Then at the dwarven kingdom, there was that battle at the sacred mountain. He had displayed such extreme power...</p><br/><p>Nedis' heart was no longer able to suppress her feelings. She could not help but give a gentle cough.</p><br/><p>Rody, who had been in deep thought, simply turned his head around to look at her. He faintly said, \"You are here.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis felt a little disappointed but she still smiled sweetly and went to Rody's side. She took off her shoes and stretched out her feet into the water. She then smiled and said, \"What are you thinking about?\"</p><br/><p>Rody's reply made Nedis almost vomit out blood.</p><br/><p>\"I was thinking of Nicole\u2026\" Rody sighed. \"I met her in the Imperial Capital on this day, last year. Time flies. A year has actually passed already.\"</p><br/><p>Nedis' movements turned stiff for a moment. Her sweet smile turned bitter.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Hideyoshi arrived.</p><br/><p>Nedis naturally recognized Hideyoshi. She immediately hid her own feelings and said, \"I am going back. You deal with this fellow.\"</p><br/><p>She had even lost the mood to deal with Hideyoshi. With a bad temper, Nedis went to look for a place devoid of people to vent.</p><br/><p>Once Nedis had left like a gust of wind, Rody looked at Hideyoshi's face and slowly walked over.</p><br/><p>The hairs on Hideyoshi's body stood up. He saw the man walking towards him and felt like a weak sheep facing a lion.</p><br/><p>\"Are you nervous?\" Rody laughed.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi suppressed the alarmed feeling in his heart and straightened his body. He said, \"I\u2026I recognize you.\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded and replied. \"Yes. I also remember you, Hideyoshi.\"</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi gritted his teeth and said, \"I\u2026I came to see Young Master Yukinari. Today, he had given an order\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Rody's eyes suddenly gazed coldly at Hideyoshi's face. It was as though his cold gaze turned sharp and cut into his heart. Hideyoshi involuntarily stopped speaking.</p><br/><p>\"Your eyes tell me that you are an ambitious person.\" Rody indifferently said.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi immediately felt tensed.</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly walked over and gently put his hand on Hideyoshi's shoulders. His voice rang in Hideyoshi's ears. \"Right now, I will speak and you will listen. Unless I ask you anything, you do not speak. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi subconsciously nodded.</p><br/><p>\"You must remember this. Right now, you are just a subordinate. Yukinari is your master. Before anything else, you must bear in mind one point\u2026\" Rody's eyes looked down towards the katana on Hideyoshi's waist. \"A qualified subordinate should not be wearing weapons in the inner courtyard of his master. This is not just courtesy but also the rules. You better remember this.\"</p><br/><p>Rody's hand pressed down on Hideyoshi's shoulder. Hideyoshi's body turned stiff. He could feel Rody's boundless aura pressure him until he felt breathless.</p><br/><p>\"I know why you came here. I know what you intend to say to Yukinari.\" Rody continued. His voice was not stern. On the contrary, it was very gentle. \"However, you do not need to say anything else about this.\"</p><br/><p>Rody loosened his grip on Hideyoshi's shoulders and walked behind him. The moment his hand left the shoulder, Hideyoshi immediately felt relaxed.</p><br/><p>However, Rody's following words made Hideyoshi's nerves tighten.</p><br/><p>\"Remember your identity! Do not say things you are not supposed to say. Do not think of things you are not supposed to think of. Do not ask about things you are not supposed to know. Do not do things you are not supposed to do!\" Rody's voice came from behind. He slowly and gently added, \"That is if you want to live well.\"</p><br/><p>After pausing for a while, Rody asked, \"Do you understand?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026I understand\u2026\" Hideyoshi heard himself answer.</p><br/><p>\"Good.\" Rody replied, \"Remember this. Do not make me say it a second time. If I say it a second time, you will regret it.\"</p><br/><p>After that, Rody slowly walked away.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi felt the back of his clothes soaked with sweat. He felt a biting cold from the night breeze.</p><br/><p>That guy\u2026</p><br/><p>For some reason, Hideyoshi felt as though that person could kill him with a wave of his hand if he wanted to. That kind of aura could not be faked.</p><br/><p>Hideyoshi felt that this kind of aura that was bursting with oppression was not something one was born with.</p><br/><p>It was obtained from many piles of corpses.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Hideyoshi moistened his dry lips as he looked at the main hall. He remembered his purpose of coming here.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he stomped his feet, and turning around, he left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

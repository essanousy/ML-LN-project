A troop of Imperial Guards had been waiting there under orders to meet the envoy. Leading the guards was Rody\u2019s old acquaintance, Commander Gordon, who had now been promoted to General Gordon. This was because Gordon had already been the Deputy Commander of the Imperial Guards after the war with the Roland Continent\u2019s army.</p><br/><p>Before Gordon arrived, he was ordered by His Majesty the Emperor to keep the return of the envoy strictly confidential. After receiving the envoy, his orders must be obeyed without exception.</p><br/><p>Gordon and his two adjutants waited at the shore when the ship docked at the pier. A group of people then got off the ship.</p><br/><p>Leading the group was a large sturdy figure. He had a resolute and melancholic expression. Gordon recognized him as Earl Rody, the one rumored to be the Emperor\u2019s illegitimate child.</p><br/><p>With vigor, Gordon immediately walked up and bowed. He soon saw the man behind Rody and became stupefied.</p><br/><p>The young man behind Rody was slender and tall. He had a handsome face that would even make the Sun God jealous. He had long blond hair and lake blue eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Duke of the Tulip Family\u2026Duke!\" When Gordon saw Rody, he only showed ceremonious respect. However, the moment he saw the Duke of the Tulip Family, he reflexively shouted and knelt on the ground. His two adjutants from the Imperial Guards had also previously fought together with Rody in the Northwest. Naturally, they would recognize the \u2018Duke\u2019s\u2019 appearance and instantly knelt down with surprised expressions.</p><br/><p>'Wasn\u2019t he behind closed doors nursing his injuries? How come the Duke is here accompanying the envoy to the Roland Continent?'</p><br/><p>Gordon immediately realized that this was a secret from the upper levels of the Empire. It was not something he should be excessively inquisitive about. Gordon whispered to the two behind him, \"The Duke\u2019s whereabouts is the Empire\u2019s greatest secret. Do not leak this information!\"</p><br/><p>The two adjutants subserviently agreed.</p><br/><p>Rody suddenly felt perplexed when he saw General Gordon finally treating Seth as the Duke of the Tulip Family.</p><br/><p>Rody momentarily felt at a loss when he saw them show their utmost respect towards Seth. This kind of look was once only for Rody. This kind of glory was something he had earned from personally involved in bloody duels. Losing this made Rody feel somewhat empty.</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s expression was somewhat strange. Mouse immediately noticed the subtle change in his mood. Rody was in a daze when he felt a small and soft hand holding his palm. He looked back at Mouse and saw her eyes filled with tenderness. He suddenly smiled.</p><br/><p>'Yes. So what if I lost the glory that is fleeting like clouds? I have already obtained the most precious thing in the world!'</p><br/><p>Seth was truly talented at acting. He maintained his composure and bore the majestic posture of the Duke. He nodded and said, \"Get up. This time, Rody is in command.\"</p><br/><p>Rody also nodded and laughed. \"General Gordon, have you been well?\"</p><br/><p>Gordon saluted. He laughed and said, \"Everything is well. The Earl has shown no disgrace during the diplomatic mission. His Majesty would reward you heavily after you return. Let me first congratulate you here.\"</p><br/><p>Rody immediately ordered Gordon to find two carriages. He invited Seth, Mouse, and Ruolan into a carriage. After all, Seth was now once again the Duke of the Tulip Family. It was not suitable for him to be seen publicly.</p><br/><p>When Rody saw Nedis again, he did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>Nedis looked calm. She smiled and said, \"Alright. Everything has settled down, Rody. I should also leave now. Please get me a horse. I will be able to go back by myself.\"</p><br/><p>Rody opened his mouth. \"You\u2026\" However, Rody did not know how to continue from there.</p><br/><p>Nedis sighed. \"There are no feasts that never ends in this world, Rody. Let us leave it at that.\"</p><br/><p>She moved to one side and took a horse. The nearby adjutant saw that the Earl did not say anything and obediently gave her the horse.</p><br/><p>Nedis jumped onto it. She whipped the horse and galloped off. The horse started running. After running about ten meters, she suddenly shouted, \"Rody! I hate you!\"</p><br/><p>After that, she continued without stopping and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Rody looked at the disappearing figure, unable to tell the feelings in his heart. Old Mark simply smiled at the side and said, \"Don't shilly-shally! What should be yours would remain yours. Even if you put it aside, it would not be able to escape. What are you worried about? As long as she remains in the Empire, you would not need to worry that you would not be able to find her.\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark then pushed a crystal into Rody\u2019s palm and softly whispered, \"I have already secretly cast a magic spell on her. Take this crystal. You would be able to find her even if she runs to the ends of the world.\"</p><br/><p>After that, this devilish old man laughed and jumped up onto Seth's carriage.</p><br/><p>Rody was in a daze as he held the crystal in his hand. He did not notice Mouse sigh as she looked at him from the carriage.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you sighing?\" Ruolan, who shared the same carriage as Mouse, asked. She had lost her scary strength, making her look like an ordinary person aside from her large size. Besides that, losing her Paladin strength had turned her into a fat person who gasped for breath after every two steps. She said, \"Men are not good people. You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up.\" Mouse coldly replied and then closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>Mouse treated everyone except Rody coldly. This iceberg would only melt for Rody.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>With an escort of two thousand Imperial Guards, the group traveled towards the Imperial Capital. Only Gordon and a few of his trusted subordinates knew that the Duke of the Tulip Family was also with the group. The rest of the soldiers did not know.</p><br/><p>All of them were fanatical worshippers of the Duke of the Tulip Family. These few subordinates were no exception as they rode their horses as close to Seth\u2019s carriage as frequently as possible. They tried their best to give a majestic impression hoping to get the Duke's attention.</p><br/><p>Rody smiled in his heart. He was not used to riding in a carriage and rode a horse beside Gordon.</p><br/><p>\"General Gordon, your two subordinates are really amusing.\"</p><br/><p>Gordon laughed. \"The little rascals would definitely not be able to hold it in when they know that the army\u2019s god is in that carriage.\" He then sighed. \"If I am allowed to be rude, I have also witnessed the rise of the duke. I have even fought together with the duke in the Northwest.\" He then glanced at Rody and laughed. \"Earl was also the Duke\u2019s subordinate. Me saying all this is just singing my own praise.\"</p><br/><p>Rody laughed and replied, \"You do not need to be courteous.\" He paused for a while and looked at the anxious young adjutants by Seth\u2019s carriage. Smiling, he said, \"Commander Gordon, please ask your men to come back. Like this, they would look unsightly. If they are interested, I can introduce and recommend them into the Lightning God\u2019s Whip in service of the Duke.\"</p><br/><p>Gordon laughed. \"Then I will thank you for them! Those two are good people. If they could follow the duke, their future prospects would be good! Alas\u2026it is boring to remain in the palace.\"</p><br/><p>Gordon suddenly noticed something. \"What did you call me\u2026? Commander Gordon?\"</p><br/><p>Rody immediately realized that he had made a mistake. He had already been accustomed to addressing Gordon this way at the Northwest.</p><br/><p>Gordon showed a weird expression. \"Why does your tone also sound so familiar when you called me Commander Gordon?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Seven days later, the delegation arrived at the Imperial Capital. When they returned, Rody was surprised to see more soldiers patrolling the city walls compared to usual. Many warriors wore the Flame Warriors uniform on the gates and at the streets, patrolling together with the city guards.</p><br/><p>Rody frowned and glanced at Gordon. \"What happened? Why are the Flame Warriors at the Imperial Capital?\"</p><br/><p>Gordon smiled wryly and replied, \"This? Under His Majesty\u2019s prohibition command, I cannot tell you. You should go and personally ask His Majesty.\"</p><br/><p>Gordon thought to himself. 'You are His Majesty\u2019s illegitimate son. If you ask, I am sure His Majesty would tell you. However, I cannot go against His Majesty\u2019s orders.'</p><br/><p>The delegation entered the Imperial Capital and went to the palace. Along the way, many Flame Warriors could be seen on the streets carrying weapons and making inspections. This scene made Rody restless.</p><br/><p>A group of escorts from the delegation escorted Seth to the Duke\u2019s residence. Rody learned that Nicole had returned to the Imperial Capital and also wanted to go back immediately. However, the Emperor had given the order for Rody to proceed immediately to the Imperial Palace to see him. Even though he did not know what ruse the Old Skeleton had up his sleeve, it was not proper for Rody to object.</p><br/><p>Everything was as usual at the Imperial Palace. There was nothing strange. However, at the Radiant Hall, the Emperor had already summoned the loyal officers and even the Deputy Commander of the Lightning God\u2019s Whip, Sieg. The old fox Marquis Garoline also waited for Rody\u2019s arrival.</p><br/><p>Rody had, accompanied by Gordon, changed into a clean armored uniform of the commander of Imperial Guards. He was then brought to meet the Emperor. It seemed that the meeting would be very formal.</p><br/><p>\"Rody! You have finally returned!\" The moment Rody walked into the hall, Andy who was sitting on the throne excitedly shouted. He also pretended to laugh and said, \"My dear Rody, I heard you have successfully completed the mission. I am proud of you!\"</p><br/><p>He had walked in front of Rody and gave him a warm hug before Rody could reply.</p><br/><p>The other ministers including Marquis Garoline could not help but sigh. \"After all, it is His Majesty\u2019s illegitimate child. The ties between father and son must be very strong.\"</p><br/><p>Rody was embarrassed and whispered into Andy\u2019s ears. \"What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up and play along,\" Andy said before letting go.</p><br/><p>Andy then went back to his throne. He ordered Rody to formally report about the events of the diplomatic mission.</p><br/><p>Rody had already long prepared his report. He spoke of the situation at the Roland Continent. The Sauron Kingdom had united with the other kingdoms of the Roland Continent to go to war against the Temple. The Sauron Kingdom also had occupied the Dwarven Kingdom and obtained control of the ironwood resources. Finally, all the Paladins on the Roland Continent were dead except for Fielding.</p><br/><p>When these matters were related one after another, the ministers were all endlessly surprised.</p><br/><p>Rody was originally sent on a diplomatic mission to have a peace discussion with the Roland kingdoms. He was to think of ways to cause a civil strife so that the kingdoms and the Temple would be busy fighting. They did not expect it to be so successful. Right now, both sides have openly turned hostile against each other.</p><br/><p>\"Good! Very good!\" Andy deliberately beamed. Andy replied \u2018very good\u2019 to each and every of Rody\u2019s sentences with a satisfied expression. The delighted look in his eyes seemed to show paternal love.</p><br/><p>There was a pause. Andy then said, \"Rody, I presume you do not know but a few days ago, while you were probably on the way back, we received news from the Roland Continent. That Prometheus from the Temple had crowned himself Pontiff! The Sauron Kingdom\u2019s army had already gathered at their border for the coming confrontation with the Holy Knights of the Temple. The war now cannot be avoided!\"</p><br/><p>All the ministers genuflected and loudly cheered. \"God bless our Radiant Empire!\"</p><br/><p>Andy then loudly said, \"In view of Earl Rody\u2019s great success and contribution to the Empire, I am determined to reward him well!\"</p><br/><p>There was a pause. Andy then revealed a cunning look. He smiled and said, \"Rody, feel free to make a suggestion!\"</p><br/><p>Rody froze for a moment before he shook his head. \"I have none.\"</p><br/><p>Andy laughed. \"Alright. If you are too embarrassed to say it, then I will say it for you!\"</p><br/><p>He gently coughed and said, \"I already know about the matter between you and Miss Nicole. Now, you have safely returned and have also contributed greatly to the Empire. I have decided for you and will wed Miss Nicole of the Tulip Family to you. The two of you will marry in three days, and I will personally preside over the wedding ceremony.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" Rody was dumbfounded. He did not object to marrying Nicole, but he felt that it was going too fast.</p><br/><p>He saw the other ministers giving him a weird smile. They had apparently heard of his love story with Nicole. After all, tales of the love between Nicole and the Emperor\u2019s illegitimate son at the Westwood province had already spread.</p><br/><p>Amongst the people gazing at him, Sieg also smiled happily. After all, Sieg was the Deputy Commander of the Lightning God\u2019s Whip. He could already be regarded as a subordinate that was closest to the Tulip Family. If Rody were to marry Nicole, he could then be considered as one of the family.</p><br/><p>\"In addition, I have decided to revoke Rody\u2019s military rank as an Imperial Guard and promote him to a Marquis! He\u2026\" The Emperor glanced at the audience and said, \"He would also be the Regiment Commander of the Central Cavalry! The Commander of the Lightning God\u2019s Whip!\"</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The audience burst into an uproar!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

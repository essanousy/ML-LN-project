Meanwhile, Madam Sophie\u2019s face was pale and she was terrified. She was a wise person and understood that the current problem was not a small problem. Sultan made it clear that he was the prince of the Great Moon Kingdom and was probably a diplomatic envoy. On the other hand, Bayan was also an important aristocrat. Bayan and Young Master Seth were the Emperor\u2019s nephew and the heir to the family with the greatest military exploits. The injured Didi and Dardaniel also have important backgrounds. With such an incident, there might be an investigation and she might need to bear responsibilities.</p><br/><p>Bayan was displeased. Although he did not voice it out, he was arguing in his heart. He naturally understood the purpose of the Great Moon Kingdom\u2019s envoy. The reason involved political business between the two countries. However, he ended up fighting with them in a prostitute house. The number of problems that would arise from that would not be small. He no longer has any intention to seek pleasure. He just justified himself and prepared to leave. He wanted to quickly return home and discuss with his father as to how to deal with the problem.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Rody was weak and was brought into a room by a few servants. He found that the decorations in the room were simple yet elegant and the bed was soft like the clouds. A nearby table had a incense burner exuding a sweet and enticing aroma.,</p><br/><p>The servants left immediately after placing him in the room. Rody laid down for a while and could feel himself recovering. Although he did not suffer any injuries, that last attack was something more than what his body could withstand.</p><br/><p>He heard a light creaking sound. Then the door opened and a beautiful figure slowly walked in.</p><br/><p>Myka slowly walked to the bedside and looked at Rody who was lying down on the bed with a bewildered expression.</p><br/><p>Rody also felt agitated but he was determined not to speak first.</p><br/><p>So they stared at each other for a long time until Myka finally sighed. The heavy sigh was like a complaint for causing endless worry. She then took out, from the table in front of the bed, a small black bottle and unscrewed the cap. She handed the bottle over and spoke softly. \u201cDrink this. This is something someone else gave me. I heard that it is good for internal injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody took the bottle and was pondering for a moment whether to consume its contents or not, when suddenly Myka asked, \u201cTell me. Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rody\u2019s hands trembled and he nearly dropped the bottle.</p><br/><p>Myka\u2019s eyes slowly and gently studied Rody\u2019s face and lightly said. \u201cStop pretending. You are not Seth! Who are you and why are you pretending to be him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody felt that his mouth was dry while his mind was screaming. Shit! Shit! The secret is exposed!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not need to be nervous.\u201d Myka smiled gently. However, her smile did not contain any hint of happiness. \u201cI will not expose your identity. If I had wanted to expose your identity, I would have done so earlier. In fact, I want to thank you for protecting me earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know that I am not Seth?\u201d Rody thought for a long time before he cautiously asked.</p><br/><p>Myka shook her head and whispered. \u201cYou are definitely not him. First of all, he was not as strong as you. Also\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Myka\u2019s face turned red before continuing. \u201cI know, he had already left the Imperial Capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Myka sighed. \u201cThe night he left, he came to see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s face turned red. \u201cYou and him\u2026. You are his.\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not somebody close to him,\u201d Myka replied lightly. The tone of her voice was light as if it does not contain any emotion. \u201cHe came that night and told me that he was going to leave the Imperial Capital and just wanted to say goodbye. I asked if he could take me along but then he lied to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Myka gently raised her hands to show the silver family crest. It was the same one she threw into Rody\u2019s arms. It was not known as to when she retrieved it.</p><br/><p>When Rody heard this, he secretly sighed to himself. He understood the meaning of Myka\u2019s words. He knew that Seth was a playboy and would definitely have relationships with more women than just Myka. It was already quite an unexpected task for him to come and bid farewell to Myka before his departure. For that playboy with a free and uninhibited nature, it would be impossible to take a woman along while pursuing his dreams. To him, women would only be a burden.</p><br/><p>Myka smiled in a self-depreciating manner. \u201cWhen I saw you earlier, I thought Seth has returned. I did not know whether I was happy or angry. But as soon as you spoke, I knew that you were not Seth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody smiled wryly. \u201cI knew that this is not something I can keep a secret forever.\u201d After a while, Rody whispered. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say that to me.\u201d Myka calmly replied. \u201cI want to thank you for saving me earlier and for helping me to untie the knot in my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, now\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am alright.\u201d Myka smiled faintly. \u201cMy heart feels very calm. Whatever feelings I had is now gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two then became silent for a while. Rody did not know what was appropriate to say. Facing a sad woman, he really lacked the experience and did not even know how to say any consoling words. Moreover, the woman was an amazing beauty. Her every move was filled with elegance to the extent that Rody did not dare to stare. For a moment, Rody could not help but feel jealous of Seth for having the admiration of such a beauty. Yet, Seth was cruel enough to walk away from her.</p><br/><p>The silence was finally broken when someone came in to inform them that the Tulip family had sent someone over to pick up Young Master Seth.</p><br/><p>Myka nodded and looked at Rody. \u201cAre you okay? Can you move?\u201d Although her tone was flat, her gentle voice could stir the hearts of those who heard it.</p><br/><p>Rody nodded and struggled to sit up on the bed. To begin with, he was not injured and was just lying down to restore his energy. Although he had not fully recovered, he could still move around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Myka. Also\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will not reveal your secret.\u201d Myka casually mentioned. \u201cFrom today onwards, I have nothing to do with that person. As for your business, I have nothing to do with it as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody sighed, turned around and was about to leave but before he could, Myka suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your name?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRody!\u201d</p><br/><p>Myka lightly looked at Rody\u2019s face, frowned and coldly said. \u201cThe situation in the Imperial Capital is constantly changing, full of power struggles. As a youngster, you must be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Rody nodded. When he saw Myka looking away from him and staring blankly out of the window, he sighed and continued walking out of the room.</p><br/><p>For a moment, for whatever reason, Rody felt distressed.</p><br/><p>Suddenly his mind had a strange thought. If I were really Seth, would she still use such an indifferent attitude towards me?</p><br/><p>The person picking up Rody was Randt. The trouble stirred up here was immediately reported to the Tulip family. Randt was already waiting impatiently in the hall. He felt great relief only when he saw Rody appearing perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Seth. It is good that you are alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody nodded and followed Randt out.</p><br/><p>The guests were already long gone. The guards of the Imperial Capital were at the entrance, investigating. However, the moment they saw Rody, they respectfully gave way to him.</p><br/><p>Outside, the carriage was already waiting for Rody. Randt waited for Rody to get onto the carriage before getting onto his horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got into trouble again!\u201d Rody saw Nicole sitting at the innermost seat, the moment he got onto the carriage. Her face seemed heavy.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Rody did not feel like arguing with Nicole. He just quietly sat beside her.</p><br/><p>Nicole also noticed Rody\u2019s difference in behavior and felt strange. After thinking for a while, she could not help but ask. \u201cYou\u2026 are you hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words were filled with concern and made Rody\u2019s heart melt. He felt that Miss Nicole was more gentle and pleasant as compared to Myka\u2019s indifferent attitude earlier. He whispered back. \u201cI am sorry. I just did not expect you to come and fetch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I heard the news, I could not sit still,\u201d Nicole spoke softly as she showed her concern.</p><br/><p>Rody felt warm and held Nicole\u2019s hand.. softly saying, \u201cNicole, I am sorry. I have disappointed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole blushed and tried to remove his hands but her heart did not want to. She could only sigh and asked, \u201cWhy did you come\u2026 to this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rody explained about how he met Bayan and the other two people in the academy. He then explained about how they dragged him here and their conflict with Prince Sultan. Nicole\u2019s eyebrow wrinkled quietly.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Rody kept the fact that Myka saw through his identity. For some reason, he did not want Nicole to know about Myka.</p><br/><p>When Rody finished, Nicole\u2019s facial expression changed and she said again. \u201cRody, this time you are really in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rody was puzzled. \u201cIs it because of Sultan\u2019s identity? He is just a prince but Bayan is the Emperor\u2019s nephew and I am currently also the heir of the Tulip family. Do we need to fear him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole smiled gently. \u201cYou are naturally not afraid of him, but the Empire is currently afraid of the Great Moon Kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nicole looked at Rody and spoke slowly. \u201cYou did not know. Last month, in the Western Papans Grasslands, the Empire and the Great Moon Kingdom were at war. The Empire suffered a crushing defeat. The Northwest Legion had 200,000 soldiers but now less than half remains! Right now, the Great Moon Kingdom\u2019s 80,000 armored cavalry is occupying the Rostock province. The Great Moon Kingdom is now assembling in the northwest city of Mudan and is eyeing the territory of the Western Empire.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

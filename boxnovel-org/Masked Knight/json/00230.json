Amu said, \"Could it be that the person who came from the Radiant Continent is a madman?\"</p><br/><p>Ice said, \"Did he damage his head?\"</p><br/><p>Ni Lin asked gloomily, \"What did you say earlier?\"</p><br/><p>Rody shook his head and seemed to look at the sky, \"Why? Why are people unable to accept things that are beyond them? Perhaps they do not believe in my words right from the beginning? Or perhaps they deliberately laugh to hide the uneasiness in their hearts?\" Rody then gave a wry smile as he shook his head. He sighed and muttered, \"Why did I suddenly say these strange words?\"</p><br/><p>\"Old man Moses, these are the thoughts you have left behind for me...\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint was calm as she looked at the man in front of her. She did not look away and had resolute eyes.</p><br/><p>Rody laughed and asked, \"Do you believe my words?\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint nodded softly. Her beautiful hair fell to the side of her head. Rody resisted stretching out to her forehead to run his fingers through her hair. He whispered, \"You have not changed. You are still a fool.\"</p><br/><p>Rody slowly walked forward, beyond Augustine who was obstructing the three Dragon Paladins. He did not look back at the seriously injured Paladin but simply said, \"Uncle, go and take a good rest.\"</p><br/><p>\"Un\u2026Uncle1?\"</p><br/><p>Augustine did not collapse from all the injuries he sustained from the three Paladins. However, Rody\u2019s words almost made him collapse from anger.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha\u2026\" Seth laughed uncontrollably. \"How funny. This boy has really changed. 'Uncle'?\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark frowned and asked, \"What is so funny about it? Madman of the Tulip Family.\"</p><br/><p>Seth sighed and softly said, \"Don\u2019t you think that his tone and his infuriating manner is becoming more like me?\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark gave him a supercilious look.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Rody stood in front of the three Dragon Paladins and slowly drew out the Dragon Spell Scimitar from his waist. He gently drew a line across the ground. He then stood outside of the line and said, \"Across this line here is my territory. You are all not allowed to cross it!\"</p><br/><p>The three Paladins were all much taller than Rody. Rody stood in front of the three of them and looked at them who were each enveloped with blazing golden fighting energy. He then said, \"Come on. Will you all attack together? Or one at a time?\"</p><br/><p>Ni Lin sneered and said, \"What a joke! Do you think we need three Dragon Paladins to deal with one madman of the Radiant Continent?\"</p><br/><p>Ice shook his head and said, \"Amu, we will leave this to you.\"</p><br/><p>The colossus-like Amu grinned cynically while he cracked his knuckles.</p><br/><p>The people around them voluntarily made space for them. The Great Sorceror Yin Xing moved far away. Ni Lin and Ice had also moved back. They folded their hands and pondered while looking at the scene.</p><br/><p>However, Ni Lin instinctively had a complicated expression...</p><br/><p>\"Kill!\" Amu suddenly roared loudly. He curled up his huge body and shot towards Rody like a meteor. His huge fists were like the fists of the Gods, punching towards Rody's chest.</p><br/><p>Rody was hit by this heavy blow and flew away into the sky!</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, he did not even counter this first attack!</p><br/><p>Amu laughed wildly as his huge body soared towards the sky. Although his body was huge, he was still very agile. He was so quick that he had already jumped above Rody\u2019s head!</p><br/><p>The sword in his hands flashed coldly as he accurately slashed the crown of Rody\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The moment he slashed downwards, the sound of the thunderclap at the head shocked everyone!</p><br/><p>Rody did not even groan as he fell back towards the ground. His fall was faster compared to the speed when he shot up!</p><br/><p>Amu\u2019s body stopped moving for a short while. After that, his huge body moved quickly like a rabbit. He instantly twisted his body and dived down. He was still faster than Rody\u2019s falling speed. It was like his enemy was his shadow. Relentlessly, he entangled himself with Rody.</p><br/><p>Then Amu punched him again!</p><br/><p>The punch once again struck Rody\u2019s chest, causing his entire body to curl forward, with his back facing the ground. He then heavily crashed into the ground and created a large hole that was half a meter wide!</p><br/><p>There was a muffled sound as Amu landed by his side with both huge legs slamming onto the ground, causing a few cracks to appear. He then shouted furiously and continuously attacked Rody who was on the ground like a violent storm.</p><br/><p>It seemed Rody could not fight back at all. Rody\u2019s face, chest and abdomen were pummeled continuously!</p><br/><p>Each strike from Amu\u2019s fists or sword came together with a faint thunderous sound. There was a huge blast, forcing the others to move back even more. Dust flew into the sky. Amu\u2019s movements became faster and faster. Finally, only his blurred silhouette was visible but not his movements.</p><br/><p>\"This madman must have really made Amu angry! He actually used his Wind Dragon Twenty-Nine Strikes!\" Ice took a deep breath and seemed surprised by Amu\u2019s imposing aura.</p><br/><p>This guy from the Radiant Empire is finished! Augustine thought.</p><br/><p>Even I would probably not be able to withstand against those storm-like attacks. On top of that, this fool did not parry a single strike! He was beaten up since the start and was now simply lying down there.</p><br/><p>While everybody had their own thoughts, Amu suddenly gave an earthshaking dragon\u2019s cry.</p><br/><p>A pair of dragon wings also appeared behind his back. As he cried out, he punched the ground beside Rody. The huge impact actually launched Rody up. Amu then kicked Rody\u2019s back and kicked it again when he flew to the skies with his wings flapping. He flew above Rody again as his fighting energy multiplied. He pointed his sword at Rody from a higher ground and chanted a few strange words slowly and clearly.</p><br/><p>\"Dragon language!\"</p><br/><p>Augustine, the Black Veil Saint, and even Seth, who was hiding at the clifftop, had the same thought.</p><br/><p>Ice shouted, \"Amu has gone mad!\"</p><br/><p>An apparition2 instantly separated from Amu\u2019s huge body. The golden apparition was like his clone. The apparition then descended and hit Rody\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A huge blade of wind in a circular arc tore Rody\u2019s upper clothes into pieces. Amu then laughed wildly as the sword in his hands shot forward.</p><br/><p>\"Wind Dragon Slash!\" Ice exclaimed. \"Amu is crazy!\"</p><br/><p>The two of them spread out their dragon wings at the same time. They then firmly wrapped their wings around their bodies. Their dragon auras also formed a light around them.</p><br/><p>Augustine shouted, \"Shit!\" He immediately took his sword and drew a circle around himself and the Black Veil Saint. Golden fighting energy came out from the circle the moment it was completed. The circular-shaped fighting energy seemed to form a wall and protect those behind it. After that, there was a loud explosion.</p><br/><p>The huge blast caused Augustine\u2019s wall to shake. The golden fighting energy on his body grew even more intense as he tried to maintain the protective circle.</p><br/><p>A huge crater appeared on the ground. There was a long crack that was one meter deep and ten meters long that extended to both sides of the crater and stretched into the woods.</p><br/><p>It was as if the entire ground was cut into two by Amu\u2019s final attack.</p><br/><p>Amu finally descended to Rody\u2019s side. He had launched a series of attacks and even used a lot of his energy to deploy his ultimate attack. At the moment, he was gasping for breath. He looked at his opponent lying at his feet. His opponent had taken all of his attacks with his body. However, the more Amu hit his opponent, the more uneasy he felt. The indescribable fear forced him to use his strongest attack.</p><br/><p>The opponent I fought can\u2019t even strike back and yet I used my strongest attack?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, nothing strange had happened. The battle had gone very smoothly. The storm-like attack right from the beginning had subdued the enemy.</p><br/><p>Amu breathed out. When the dust started to settle, he suddenly heard a sound. The gravel below him moved!</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, he saw a figure slowly got up and stood right in front of him.</p><br/><p>That face was very close to him. It was a face without any expression.</p><br/><p>There was no expression of pain, anger or confusion. It only seemed to have a faint hint of mockery. After that, his opponent laughed a little.</p><br/><p>He seemed to ask in a soft voice, \"Are you done?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Amu turned stiff and cold. All of his cold sweat came out. His opponent\u2019s cold voice seemed to carry an irresistible charm. Amu instinctively answered in a trembling voice, \"I\u2026I am done.\"</p><br/><p>Rody nodded indifferently. He then said in a cold voice, \"Then, now it is my turn.\"</p><br/><p>Amu suddenly felt his chest turn cold. Before he realized it, his opponent\u2019s palm had already been placed on his chest...</p><br/><p>This feels cooling\u2026</p><br/><p>These were the Wind Dragon Warrior Amu\u2019s last thoughts!</p><br/><p>Everyone, including Ni Lin and Ice, clearly saw the shockingly indescribable scene.</p><br/><p>Rody\u2019s palm was placed lightly on Amu\u2019s chest. Immediately, a dazzling and brilliant light appeared at the place between Rody\u2019s palm and Amu\u2019s chest. The glaring light made everyone instinctively look away. The moment they looked back, Rody\u2019s attack was already over.</p><br/><p>Blood burst out from the huge Wind Dragon Paladin Amu\u2019s body starting from his chest. After that, there were more popping sounds as everything above his chest \u2014 including his arms, neck, and head \u2014 started to burst out blood.</p><br/><p>The blood scattered in all directions as though it was a bloody fireworks display.</p><br/><p>After the top half of his body had burst into a bloody mess and disappeared, the remaining lower half of his body fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Augustine could no longer stand. The Wind Dragon Amu that he was struggling against was instantly annihilated by Rody in just one strike!</p><br/><p>This person\u2026He is definitely not human!</p><br/><p>He suddenly looked back at the Black Veil Saint and saw that she was also surprised. Augustine asked in a hoarse voice, \"Black Veil Saint, who is this guy?\"</p><br/><p>The Black Veil Saint took a deep breath while trying to regain her composure. She smiled once more and replied, \"His name is Rody. He is the Radiant Empire\u2019s Duke of the Tulip Family. He is also the man that I fell in love with.\"</p><br/><p>'The Duke...of the Tulip Family?'</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"He is not human. He is definitely not human!\" It was as if Seth had been frozen for a long time before he recovered. He sighed and looked back at Old Mark. He saw that Old Mark had the same expression as him.</p><br/><p>\"Old Mark, did you know that this boy was so powerful?\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark shook his head and replied, \"Of course not! Hell, last time, I could kill him easily but now\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Seth laughed bitterly and said, \"Now it looks like he can easily kill you with one hand.\"</p><br/><p>Old Mark was speechless.</p><br/><p>Seth frowned for a moment and seemed to have made a resolution. After that, he said, \"I have come to a decision!\"</p><br/><p>\"What have you decided?\" Old Mark frowned.</p><br/><p>Seth took a deep breath and said with an unprecedented serious expression. \"I have decided that from now on, I do not want to have any dealings with this boy ever again! I do not want to have any kind of relationship with him\u2026These kinds of things are too dangerous!\" Seth had a solemn expression, and with a voice totally devoid of any frivolous or mocking nature, he said, \"This boy is simply a devil. He is not human!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Half of Rody\u2019s body had been soiled red from the Wind Dragon\u2019s blood. His face and his hair were also soiled red. He then turned around to look at the other two dumbstruck and frightened Dragons.</p><br/><p>\"Looks like the blood of Dragons is also red. It is no different from humans.\" Rody sneered as he slowly wiped the blood from his face. He looked at the fresh blood on his hands and gave a mocking smile. \"To kill a person, a single strike is enough!\"</p><br/><p>Rody then held his scimitar with one hand and slowly stepped forward. He looked at the two frightened Dragon Paladins\u2014he had not drawn his scimitar at all in the earlier fight!</p><br/><p>Rody stretched out his hand and, with his finger, beckoned the two Dragon Paladins. He then said in a low voice, \"Next!\"</p><br/><p>Translator's Notes:</p><br/><p>1. Uncle. The Chinese call everybody who is much older than themselves 'uncle' as an honorific. It's the equivalent of 'Sir'.</p><br/><p>2. The apparition here is  Light shadow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In fact, the soul had no ability to escape.</p><br/><p>It was a human-shaped transparent body of light that seemed to have shrunk as it kneeled on the ground. The light-body seemed to sizzle around as if it was dispersing.</p><br/><p>Rody and Old Mark went up to surround him. Just as Rody was about to cut him down, Old Mark stopped him.</p><br/><p>\"You don\u2019t need to do anything anymore. With nothing to attach to, the soul would perish in a short moment.\" Old Mark sighed and threw his broken sword on the floor. He then said, \"Why? It is not easy to cultivate the soul. Why did you risk your life to fight with us?\"</p><br/><p>The soul's face had the features of the self-proclaimed Dragon God. His facial features looked fuzzy but his voice could still be heard. He weakly repeated. \"I don\u2019t believe this\u2026I don\u2019t believe this\u2026Impossible\u2026Impossible\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Seeing Rody stand in front of him, the soul finally raised his head as if carefully looking at Rody. However, his face was made out of light and his stare gave Rody a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty is still alive?\" the soul suddenly asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Rody frowned. He naturally understood who the words \u2018Your Majesty\u2019 referred to. However, there was no easy answer to that question. If it was alive, how would anyone explain the Mystic Dragon getting absorbed by Rody? If it was dead, then when Rody became possessed, how would anyone explain when he turned into the Mystic Dragon?</p><br/><p>Before Rody could feel awkward, the soul sighed and continued, \"I understand now. Your Majesty is still alive. That earlier was the Mystic Dragon\u2019s Purge. I would definitely not be wrong\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The soul then fell to his knees and said, \"Your Majesty, please forgive my sins\u2026Please forgive\u2026\"</p><br/><p>His voice was filled with endless despair as he gradually grew weak and his voice vanished. Finally, the soul started to disappear as if the last trace of consciousness he had completely vanished.</p><br/><p>Old Mark suddenly cried out, \"Quick. Absorb it before it dissipates!\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Rody froze for a moment.</p><br/><p>\"Idiot! You are now half a dragon! Only you can absorb it. Otherwise, I would have done it myself!\" Old Mark scolded.</p><br/><p>Rody lightly prodded the top of the soul with his finger. He frowned and asked, \"Are you joking? Absorb it? How am I supposed to absorb it? What are\u2026ah!\"</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his words, his finger that was touching the soul felt scorching hot. The soul turned into a golden light and entered his body through his fingertip.</p><br/><p>\"Shit!\" Rody cursed as he fell sideways and fiercely hit the ground as though he was struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>That familiar feeling rose again. The flow of energy began to move up like an endless river but then the strange black hole in his body once again rapidly drained his energy. His empty body became full before it became empty once again...</p><br/><p>This time, Rody felt a strange tingling in his mind. He instinctively closed his eyes as though something had pierced his head. He put his hands over his head and then there was a loud sound as countless pictures rushed through his head like lightning.</p><br/><p>This seemed to be the last traces of memory from the self-proclaimed Dragon God. He was \u2018looking\u2019 at history.</p><br/><p>History from thousands of years ago.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Rody saw an extremely huge, incredible black dragon flying in the sky. Its body was densely covered with black hellfire. Rody could feel the fear and despair in the air suffocating him.</p><br/><p>He did not know that these were the memories of the soul. It was as though the soul was very afraid of the Mystic Dragon in that memory. The fear had been engraved into his memory.</p><br/><p>Rody soon \u2018saw\u2019 Kara. Kara stood in the sky amongst the dark clouds. His upper body was human but his lower body comprised the bodies of six different monsters. He held a huge silver sword with one hand and a huge flaming hammer with the other...It was as though the heaven and earth were filled with a long sad howl...</p><br/><p>The mournful howl seemed to still ring in Rody\u2019s ears. Kara\u2019s image was just as described by the Church!</p><br/><p>Soon it was the earth-shattering battle between Kara and the Mystic Dragon.</p><br/><p>The Mystic Dragon had sent several black hellfires into the sky, the earth, and everywhere around him. Kara looked furious. During his long howl, the sky was torn apart. Countless lightning rained from the sky and scattered the hellfire. The two legendary creatures then started to fight...</p><br/><p>Rody felt dizzy as the picture changed.</p><br/><p>In the darkness of the chaos, there was a slight poisonous and suffocating atmosphere. There was a moment of brightness. Rody saw a huge dragon head looking attentively at him. He heard something in the dragon\u2019s language.</p><br/><p>However, in the memory, Rody could understand what was said.</p><br/><p>\"From today onwards, you are my, the Mystic Dragon\u2019s, first child!\"</p><br/><p>These words blasted Rody\u2019s heart!</p><br/><p>'The Mystic Dragon\u2019s first child! The self-proclaimed Dragon God was also one of the Mystic Dragon\u2019s child, like Wuya!'</p><br/><p>However, before Rody could think about it carefully, the picture changed quickly showing him the scene of a great war!</p><br/><p>Although Rody was familiar with the battlefield, he could not help feeling excitement when he took in the scene.</p><br/><p>What he saw was a magnificent and deeply moving scene.</p><br/><p>He saw a great sturdy jade-white city wall. Many human warriors donned in the armor of knights stood on the wall. All of the knights emitted out a holy brilliance. Some of them were strange and humanoid with one, two or even three pairs of white wings behind them. They were flying over the walls with bows or swords in their hands. However, these angel-like warriors had stronger aura than the warriors.</p><br/><p>A loud roar then came from the horizon. The huge body of the Mystic Dragon emerged from the clouds on the horizon. Its black body covered half the sky. It roared as though it was the offensive warhorn. Countless of the other dragons also roared. With a loud sound, many more large and small dragons could be seen flying in the sky.</p><br/><p>The shrill, mournful roars were so penetratingly loud that the people almost turned deaf. However, the knights on the walls held up their weapons. Archers shot out holy and purifying arrows of light. The knights sent out huge blades of light!</p><br/><p>The humanoid creatures had exceptionally powerful strength.</p><br/><p>This was particularly alarming to Rody. Each of them had the strength of a high-ranked knight. Right now, high-ranked knights were difficult to find in the human world. Even if the total number of soldiers from the Holy Knights and Lightning God\u2019s Whip were to be doubled, they would not be able to find high-ranked knights that number in the thousands!</p><br/><p>What made Rody even more surprised was the might of the dragon race.</p><br/><p>Having fought with the dragon warriors, Rody a poor impression of them. The dragon warriors were not so powerful as in the legends.</p><br/><p>However, the scenes in the memories surprised Rody.</p><br/><p>A rain of arrows and light blades from the white walls were thrown towards the dragons. The attacks in the sky caused massive successive explosions. The huge balls of light made Rody unable to open his eyes.</p><br/><p>However, the dragons quickly broke through the explosion zone. They flew above the white walls and breathed fire down. The first wave of attacks by those that looked like humans had not seemed to be effective.</p><br/><p>The dragons sent fire, wind and ice pelting down onto the walls. The soldiers used strange huge shields to block while using their own weapons to fight back.</p><br/><p>The ones that looked like angels flew up. They decided to approach the dragons and fought a close battle.</p><br/><p>The ones that looked like angels were very formidable. Although small in size, they were able to cut down the dragons with their swords. Hence, large dragons frequently fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>Their huge bodies crashed onto the city walls smashing it and sending rubble everywhere.</p><br/><p>Facing hundreds, even thousands of dragons densely covering the sky the soldiers on the white walls were soon overwhelmed. At that moment, a deep indescribable voice came from the sky. The voice said, \"The Holy City must not fall.\"</p><br/><p>With these words, innumerable lightning bolts suddenly struck from the sky.</p><br/><p>These lightning bolts flashed with a strange holy white color but were terrifying. The countless white lightning tangled up into a terrible strangling net. In this net, numerous dragons flying in the sky were instantly cut into countless pieces! Broken flesh and blood scattered all over, turning the sky and earth red.</p><br/><p>The Mystic Dragon finally roared to the sky. Rody soon witnessed a very familiar scene. A large ball of black air condensed in the sky and then a black light dragon appeared...</p><br/><p>\u2018It is the Mystic Dragon\u2019s Purge\u2026\u2019 Rody sighed.</p><br/><p>After that, there were endless explosions all over the sky. The network of white lightning was dispersed by the Mystic Dragon\u2019s Purge. Half the city walls had collapsed. There were also a lot of warriors killed and injured.</p><br/><p>Rody stared. He had seen the Mystic Dragon and Kara before but he had not seen the real \u2018God\u2019 in heaven before. Now that he was looking at the legendary war during the ancient times, he was really curious.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, a weird white light appeared that blocked everything. Everything in front was blocked by the white light and nothing could be seen.</p><br/><p>He could seemingly hear a roar in his ear. He could not tell if it was an explosion in the scene or it was his imagination.</p><br/><p>When it was clear again, the pictures Rody saw had gone through a tremendous change.</p><br/><p>In the sky, a countless number of winged angel-like creatures were killing the dragons all over the sky. The huge dragons were hunted and killed by the short angelic warriors. Rody looked carefully and noticed something strange. The angels were not powerful but the dragons had become very weak.</p><br/><p>The dragons were no longer so powerful like what he had seen earlier. They were now as weak as the so-called dragon warriors he fought today.</p><br/><p>What happened? How did such a big change happen? It looks as though there had been no change but they were several times weaker.</p><br/><p>Also, the Mystic Dragon is now missing from the sky. Only the remaining dragons were hunted tragically.</p><br/><p>The picture changed again. It now showed a pair of knees.</p><br/><p>Knees?</p><br/><p>Rody was startled. He immediately realized that this was the perspective of a person who was kneeling on the ground.</p><br/><p>Immediately, an indescribable voice from the sky came and said, \"I can forgive your sins and bestow upon you the status of Dragon God. In my glory, you will take over the place of your father, the Mystic Dragon, and the dragon race will once again be under the glory of the Holy City!\"</p><br/><p>The pictures came to a standstill. Rody felt a stinging pain in his head. The stinging pain almost made him go crazy.</p><br/><p>He desperately wanted to shout and wake up from the illusion but in a panic, he found out he could not do this. He was unable to make a single sound and was unable to control his body...</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026body?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Rody realized that he could only \u2018see\u2019 and \u2018hear\u2019 things in the illusion. He did not have a real body. It was as if everything was a fragment of a memory.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

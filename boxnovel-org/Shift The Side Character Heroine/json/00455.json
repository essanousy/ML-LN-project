Her family had been in the military for generations. Armed with strong survival skills and the intolerance for corruption, nobody dared to get close to her.</p><br/><p>Being a friend of Zhao Youyue had changed Bai Yunshan in many ways. She accepted the bad habits of Zhao Youyue as the norm of common people.</p><br/><p>Of course, the crucial element that maintained this relationship was mutual respect. Zhao Youyue and Bai Yunshan constantly inspired each other to strive for a better future.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan was confident with her performance in this final exam. Though she had placed second so many times, she could almost taste her moment of surpassing Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>This meant a lot to Bai Yunshan. She always wanted to influence Zhao Youyue on leaving the dark side and joining her on the path of righteousness. Yet, she was slowly turning into her partner in crime</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue loved to indulge her friends in good food and adventure. Life was full of more excitement than you could ever imagine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be happening. My result on National College Entrance Examination will be a record breaker!\u201d Zhao Youyue replied, even more confident than Shan-shan.</p><br/><p>Such arrogance left Bai Yunshan shocked. She could not deny the obsession Zhao Youyue over her revision. If she did it right, her result would surprise everybody!</p><br/><p>This was unavoidable. In the past exams, Zhao Youyue had managed to score distinctions after glancing through her textbooks. Now that she had actually revised for real, her results would be from an entirely different dimension.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe shall see when the scores are released. So, which university are you applying to?\u201d Bai Yunshan asked, curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me guess, would your choice be the same as mine?\u201d Zhao Youyue replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan nodded in embarrassment. She was happy to have been given the chance to be Zhao Youyue\u2019s friend.</p><br/><p>She had known little about having a close friend around until she met Zhao Youyue, even if that Lady had been a bad influence.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was full of mystery. On the outside, she seemed like a gentle, kind person. But she was actually a mischievous troll in disguise. Of course, she could not have been this crafty if she did not have the intelligence to match it. Ban Yunshan had never known anyone who could slack so much in her studies, yet remain at the top of the food chain!</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we try for Peking University?\u201d Zhao Youyue suggested at random.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is closer to home\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Zhao Youyue wanted to apply for Jiangnan University. Her mother was one of its lecturers. She would have a longer leash there, thanks to her family connections.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Jiangnan University could not match the rating of Peking University nor Chung Hwa University. However, Zhao Youyue just wanted to stay low profile and graduate for a certificate. It did not matters which university she go.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not the only person who treated universities like resorts. A good 70% probably thought the same.</p><br/><p>The high school teachers were to blame on this. They had thoroughly brainwashed their students about the leisure life in university. If they focused and strived hard in the high school final exam, they would be able to enjoy life in a good university.</p><br/><p>Students who believed in these teachers would put their all into their exams. Their final year in school would be their toughest</p><br/><p>The four years of university life would be a breeze, that\u2019s for sure!For example, it was easy to pass CET-4 and CET-6 during the final year of high school. [1] It would have been a nightmare to take these English exams at university!</p><br/><p>It could not be helped. Exam questions in university were never the same as before. Revising did little to help them. It would be more appropriately coined as the prediction of exam questions.</p><br/><p>It was still possible to give the same effort in high school revision and pass university exams. Even with half of the effort, there was still time to study the questions in the exam hall. Failing was unlikely. For Zhao Youyue, failing was impossible!</p><br/><p>Universities had their share of serious, studious students, students who slacked about, cheated and flunked their exams. The only difference would be the ratio and distribution.</p><br/><p>Most students applied into famous universities, armed with desire and determination for excellence. Of course, a small portion was only there for the certificate.</p><br/><p>If commoners were lucky enough, they would survive the four years of university and graduate.</p><br/><p>In Zhao Youyue\u2019s case, she could do anything she wanted!</p><br/><p>She intended to attend a university for the same reason as her attending high school. She simply wanted to experience the life of a student and enjoy it. After all, she had Xu Jing\u2019s ability to help her in exams.</p><br/><p>She might even play a part as Lady Mary, as a beam of holy light to guide lost students back on track in studies. Such beings were commonly seen as university students knelt or sat cross-legged on the ground as they crammed in the last few moments before an exam</p><br/><p>Therefore, Zhao Youyue did not give a damn about the university. It was the weather in Peking that irritated her. She preferred studying in Jiangnan.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan knew Zhao Youyue well enough to guess what she was thinking. The last thing she wanted was to be separated from Zhao Youyue. Hence, she allowed Zhao Youyue to decide on which university they would attend. They should both qualify that was without question.</p><br/><p>Yearbooks started get passed around. It was an emotional moment, a once-in-a-lifetime that was meaningful enough to be written in a book. Usually, people would just send messages in some WeChat or QQ group.</p><br/><p>Having classmates write down their feelings and thoughts was essential for most friendships. In the future, once could always take a trip down memory lane by flicking through the pages of the yearbook.</p><br/><p>Everyone was bound to be extremely busy. But there would always be some faces at school who will never want to forget. Memories of them would warm our hearts as we think about them.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan was one of the most popular figures among the guys. Many had approached her, asking her to sign on their yearbook. Almost everyone\u2019s request was fulfilled with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, you write something too, Zhao Youyue\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm.. What should I write?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish that you live happily ever after and be blessed with child soon!\u201d Zhao Youyou wrote earnestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan burst into laughter. Some of her secret admirers grabbed the opportunity and immortalized the scene in film. That was once-in-a-lifetime!</p><br/><p>It was one of the days when high school students had nothing to worry about.</p><br/><p>The results will not be announced anytime soon, right?</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] The College English Test (Chinese: ), better known as CET, is a national English as a foreign language test in the People\u2019s Republic of China.

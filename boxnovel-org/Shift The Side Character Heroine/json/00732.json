Of course, she knew what Su Li was up to. Even so, deep down there, she could not stop herself from closing her eyes in acceptance. It only served to push Su Li even further!</p><br/><p>One moment, a girl had gazed into your eyes. The next, she was closing her eyes. You now had her permission, her encouragement even. Get on with the program!</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao\u2019s innocence also brought forth an intense wave of guilt. Deep down, she vowed to herself. She would take full responsibility for everything that happened from then on.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Su Li was gorgeous. No one would refuse the feelings of affection from such a goddess.</p><br/><p>Unbeknownst to even herself, their lips finally met. Su Li had no idea how others had their first kiss, but Su Li knew that her\u2019s had produced an intense magnetic field, so powerful that it drove her crazy.</p><br/><p>As all should know, girls are pretty sentimental, and they always prioritized emotions and affection over lust. As her lips sunk into Lady Zhao\u2019s, a fresh wave of fantasies rushed into her head, along with an understanding of how inferior she truly was.</p><br/><p>There was a time when Su Li hated being born a girl. In her opinion, it was always easier for guys to earn a living in the world out there. As for girls, they would always be held back by a ceiling. If you happened to be pretty, people would just assume that you were an easy target, or a flower vase.</p><br/><p>Now, she could not be any more grateful for having two X chromosomes. On top of that, she was just pretty enough to not face rejection from a true Goddess. If she wasn\u2019t, she would not be sharing an actual bed with Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>To top it all, Lady Zhao was still as pure and innocent as she could be. It was common knowledge that most University Students would still remain innocent and sweet in their first year. Their fall from grace began in their second year.</p><br/><p>When Lady Zhao gets swooped up by some sleazy male, Su Li would not have had the courage to be taking the initiative like she did now. She was too nice to be the third person that ruins a relationship.</p><br/><p>Currently, Su Li was trying to \u2018convert\u2019 Lady Zhao. It was the least she could do to prevent Lady Zhao from being contaminated and corrupted by the male touch.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was eagerly anticipating Su Li\u2019s next step. Lip-to-lip action was nothing to her. Where\u2019s the tongue action?</p><br/><p>Su Li was too inexperienced to know any better. For her, this was already more than she could ever ask for!</p><br/><p>Having yet to experience her first love, it was unsurprising that so little would please her so much. The slightest movement would elicit the highest jumps in one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>To her surprise, Zhao Youyue was disappointed. As romantic and erotic as Su Li\u2019s characters were, their creator was a green novice.</p><br/><p>At least she was innocent, and innocence was pure and cute. She could settle for that.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because Su Li was pure, or else it wouldn\u2019t have taken all of her courage for that small peck on the lips. Little did she know that Lady Zhao was one of her biggest fans ever. Su Li was charming, elegant, and talented, all at the same time. She did such a great job with Xu Jing, for which Lady Zhao would eternally be grateful about.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not spare Su Li the luxury of indulging in her fantasy. Apparently, Lady Zhou was far too experienced for that. She took control of the situation. She grabbed Su Li\u2019s waist in her arms and reversed their positions, returning the peck on the lips to show how it was done. She did not neglect to support the back of her head with a hand, providing her with a sense of comfort and ease.</p><br/><p>Su Li was so immersed in the sensation of Lady Zhao that she couldn\u2019t help but break the silence with an utterance of pleasure. Pouncing on the opportunity, Zhao Youyue assaulted her open mouth with her tongue.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue seemed to have done this several times over. The tongues became entwined with one another, as if they were destined to complete one another.</p><br/><p>There was this odd metaphor going about that claimed kissing was like tasting jelly. The truth wasn\u2019t that simple. There were soft kisses, rough, rigorous kisses, and so on. One would need to experience it themselves to learn the difference.</p><br/><p>Shu Li felt as if she had been introduced to a whole new world. She had drawn countless kissing scenes on her notepads, but none even came close to what she had just experienced. She knew how to portray lust, but this, this was pure affection.</p><br/><p>Never would have Shu Li thought that kisses could be this seductive!</p><br/><p>Her response was a little lacking, even if her passion was not. After all, that was her first attempt. It was true that her love for Lady Zhao was unquestionable. To sum up the situation, Lady Zhao was too much of a handful for her.</p><br/><p>Indisputably, this was Zhao Youyue\u2019s first kiss ever, and the only one that was real. Nevertheless, Zhao Youyue was easily one of the best kissers the world could offer.</p><br/><p>This thought did not even cross Lady Zhao\u2019s mind as she went on with the deed. Still, here they were, so why talk about how they got here?</p></div>\n</div>"}

At that moment, she only wanted to do one thing: to show her daughter off.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue was young, she had been entirely mediocre. Anyone could be adorable, but that was all she had. Wang Hua could never brag about her young daughter!</p><br/><p>What could she say? She was born with all four limbs, and has been blessed with good health?How do you even boast about that\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Hua used to be frustrated over her daughter\u2019s apathy. Couldn\u2019t she just give her a reason to boast? She had put in so much effort and hopes that her daughter would be something extraordinary. Even so, Wang Hua pampered her daughter, regardless of how much she complained about her. Zhao Youyue was her only child, plus she was fun to play with. How could a person not pamper such an adorable child?</p><br/><p>Wang Hua never thought that her daughter would one day be one of the best. Usually, whenever her fellow parents spoke about their children\u2019s academic achievements, Wang Hua could only say that her daughter did not participate in any competitions. Even her results were not exceptional. Well, there\u2019s one thing to talk about now. She could talk about how Zhao Youyue was the top scholar of Jiangnan province, no biggie.</p><br/><p>It would invoke the jealousy of just about any parent. The top scholar was a title from olden times, and provided no prizes in cash, but it was still no easy achievement.</p><br/><p>Their children were not as skilled when it came to academics. At least, some parents could brag about the unique skills that their children have been trained with. Some have attained the highest level of Chinese calligraphy, some have achieved a piano grade of ten, while others even bragged about having their articles posted online\u2026</p><br/><p>With a smile on her face, Wang Hua said \u201cOther than music, Zhao Youyue is not good at anything. Have you all heard about that song \u201cxxx\u201d? She composed that song on a whim. What was she thinking? I wonder, how did it even become so famous on the internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to modern music, our Zhao Youyue dabbled with some classical music. Some reputable orchestras have tried a lot of methods to have her play a song on their stage with her violin. It depends on their sincerity, and of course, our Zhao Youyue\u2019s tight schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently our Zhao Youyue took up a role in some movie, what was it called again\u2026 \u201cBeautiful April?\u201d And now, we have a director asking for her to play a part in some Chinese New Year celebration movie. People are praising her, to the left and right. I wonder, where did she learn how to act? She\u2019s never taken lessons before\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hua carried on with her low-key provocations. They could not do anything but agree that her daughter was way too good for any of their children!</p><br/><p>Wang Hua did not forget to mention her involvement in the Student Union at University. She \u201clet it slip\u201d that her daughter would definitely become the president next semester. Another point for Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>Parents just loved bragging about their children.</p><br/><p>Total satisfaction. Wang Hua could not be any prouder. She loved her daughter more than ever now. What a shame, her daughter was growing up too quickly, and she did not just mean physically. She used to be far more adorable\u2026</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, everybody enjoyed their dinner that night, regardless of the fact they were not able to brag about their children.</p><br/><p>Astonished by the remarkable Zhao Youyue, Sun Wei started to search for her online\u2026 Okay, let\u2019s type in \u201cZhao Youyue,\u201d but I\u2019m only getting \u201cNo Result Found.\u201d What about searching for \u201cAh Yu\u2026\u201d ah, that\u2019s slightly more promising.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu was the nickname used by Zhao Youyue, a public secret. She was a member of the deadly Zhao Family. Directly mentioning the name \u201cZhao Youyue\u201d could cause some unwanted problems. Most people would call her Lady Ah Yu, even now. When the credits of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d came rolling down, the name that was accredited to \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was \u201cAh Yu,\u201d not \u201cZhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Therefore, those who dare mention \u201cZhao Youyue\u201d in their comments online were brave, indeed. Of course, be prepared to face the consequences. The hidden hand in the dark would have placed their agents somewhere close by\u2026</p><br/><p>This was when netizens would witness the legendary \u201cnoble princess, protected by a hidden force in the dark.\u201d Things were far more clandestine a few years ago. The hidden hand had changed its owner a few times; nobody could tell how it would behave in the future.</p><br/><p>One thing was certain, the hidden force was highly protective of Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Of course, her freedom was highly limited, under such circumstances. That was the exact reason why she had been improving herself restlessly.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere at the dinner disgusted Zhao Youyue. The only thing she was remotely interested in was the online novel author, Xiao Yiren.</p><br/><p>Dinner finally ended. Some families took their leave; others stayed for a few games of Mahjong. Xiao Yiren\u2019s family was one of those who lingered.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren had only found the courage to steal one glance at Zhao Youyue throughout the entire occasion. There was something about her that frightened him. What a remarkable lady! One day, he would write about a fictionalized version of her \u2013 from the perspective of an agent that worked for the dark forces who protected the noblewoman. Would it be an intriguing thriller of cloaks and daggers?</p><br/><p>It was a joke. Laughing at himself, he extracted his mobile phone, opened an application that allowed him to update his story, and continued writing his story \u2013 \u201cShift! The Female Elite Scholar.\u201d He had been inspired by the incidents of that night. There was much that he could write about. His readers would be thrilled!</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yiren got immersed in his craft, his nose picked up a wonder scent. Zhao Youyue\u2019s excited voice almost shook his eardrums out of his skull, \u201cYou are writing at this moment? With your phone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren\u2019s inspiration was cut off. Annoyed, he raised his head to look at the person who had taken the seat beside him without consent. She had one hand supporting her chin, surveying him through her heavy eyelids. His breath got caught up in his throat. Yes, Xiao Yiren was used to speaking to countless of beautiful ladies, and few were capable of touching his heart, while even fewer could unnerve him. Perhaps that was one of the reasons he could write something as good as \u201cShift! The Female Elite Scholar\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>This was Lady Zhao, a goddess who belonged in the heavens far above the sky. Her presence stifled his soul \u2013 he could only bow to her wishes. Xiao Yiren quickly muttered the name of his female protagonist under his breath to resist the charm of Lady Zhao!</p></div>\n</div>"}

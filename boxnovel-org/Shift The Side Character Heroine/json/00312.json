All their communications had only been on the internet. But whenever she wrote, she always had communications with \u201cAltair\u201d on her soul aspect.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d could not help herself but believe that the protagonist not only had come alive within her work, but had crossed over into reality altogether. Her creation could not stand by any longer, and had to visit this world when the reception of her work had been so dismal. She was now the only reader in her entire life who truly understood her work.</p><br/><p>At the end of the day, \u201cSetsuna\u201d was a failure of a writer. She had always been the only reader of her own works. But now, she met a reader who truly understood her, at the end of her life. It was a fitting form of redemption.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d considered this quintessential phase of her life to be the culmination of everything that she had ever done.</p><br/><p>Perhaps her entire existence was meant for this one moment.</p><br/><p>Her very concern for \u201cAltair\u201d had driven her to give her a promising future.</p><br/><p>After all, this was just an acquaintance made over the internet. Many people were like this as well. After congenially chatting on the internet, they would immediately want to meet up, face to face. But such passion would gradually decrease over time, and they would end up as strangers all over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d did not want her death to bring sorrow to those around her. She was actually guilty towards \u201cAltair,\u201d as she never got to finish the Doujinshi novel. Its final word count would be set in stone, at slightly over 100,000 words.</p><br/><p>It had become a piece of incomplete work, which would never be able to \u2018leave the palace.\u2019</p><br/><p>After all, incomplete works, belonging to living creators still had their chance to go on sale. However, \u201cWhite Clover\u201d would remain unfinished for all eternity.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d was afraid that the literary world of her work would die with her. No one would be left to guide her main character on. Therefore, she chose to grant her protagonist an avenue, a path to the world of creators, or from her perspective, \u201cThe Realm of her God.\u201d She had even given the protagonist the ability \u201cHolopsicon,\u201d so that she would live on till the end of time.</p><br/><p>Setsuna spoke to her protagonist within her heart, \u201cYou determine your own path now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d hoped that Zhao Youyue would help her make a fanmade anime video. She did not want \u201cAltair\u201d to be forgotten in the passage of time. Wouldn\u2019t a character die, the moment the world forgets about her?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not know anything about \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d idea. She was only trying her best to increase the popularity of her possessed heroine \u201cAltair\u201d to be higher. This would also increase the popularity of her other ID, \u201cAh Yu,\u201d the female streamer at the same time.</p><br/><p>Due to \u201cAh Yu\u2019s\u201d perfect voice acting performance for the popular female character Yu Shengfan in \u201cThe Strongest King,\u201d she had received great support from the VA community. Her popularity on Douyu Platform had gradually increased as well, turning her into a true, first-tier streamer!</p><br/><p>The audience were dismayed by only one obstacle. Her insistence on not showing her face, only to substitute it with a pink, long-haired, cartoon face. She soon ended up having another title called, \u201cHeadless Being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, she conquered the hearts of many, be it with her talents in gaming or in music. Her gentle, caring demeanor was also a key point. Her only disadvantage might be having lesser-than-expected Godly tycoon fans. Apparently, those fans preferred pretty faces over anything. Her concealed visage was a turn-off for them.</p><br/><p>Many VA fans were demanding to know the next work that would feature her voice. Of course, Zhao Youyue had no answer for that, as this only applied to characters that she had once possessed.</p><br/><p>Yet, thanks to the production of \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d fanmade anime video, Zhao Youyue could finally give an answer. The next work featuring her voice, would be a fanmade anime named \u201cAltair: Divina Commedia.\u201d She would personally voice act in it, and post it on Bilibili.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could also be considered to be a regular uploader on Bilibili. Many video clips about her had been posted on Bilibili, ranging from video clips related to various clips of her highlights as she slowly became the top 1 player among the solo ranks of the national server, to video recordings of her singing and playing the violin, etc. All of the video clips were very popular and were filled with comments on the bullet curtains. This would be more than enough to show how much the audiences on Bilibili preferred female streamers who used talent over appearance!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yu\u201d had gained quite a significant amount of popularity on Bilibili. Her identity as an accomplished VA was beginning to precede her.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, the fanmade anime video that \u201cAh Yu\u201d posted this time had once again gained the audiences\u2019 affirmation towards her voice acting capabilities. Let\u2019s not even get started on the BGMs she composed. It was supposed to be a short fanmade video, yet the audiences could not help but immerse themselves in the heroine \u201cAltair\u2019s\u201d grace!</p><br/><p>After \u201cSetsuna\u201d finished enjoying the video, she no longer had any regrets in life! She could finally leave in peace</p><br/><p>The video\u2019s fame soon led others to her original novel, but it remained unpopular. These were mostly writers who intended to create Doujinshi works by using \u201cAltair\u201d as the protagonist. They intended to search for some inspirations from the original novel.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d the writer among the Doujinshi circle, was actually more popular than her novel. After all, she was the real creator of \u201cAltair\u201d!</p><br/><p>She seemed to be the first writer who had not encountered any misfortunes after her heroine was inked out by \u201cThe Pan of this Generation\u201d Su Li. Su Li grew smug. She utilized this matter to her advantage, and washed away her previous curses, to great effect.</p><br/><p>Many people admired the now greatly acclaimed \u201cSetsuna.\u201d Of course, with admiration, there would be all kinds of envy, jealousy, and hate.</p><br/><p>However, no one was able to contact \u201cSetsuna\u201d through any means, and \u201cWhite Clover\u201d ceased updating altogether. Eyebrows started to raise. What had happened to this recently famous Doujinshi writer?</p><br/><p>Was Su Li\u2019s curse finally starting to take effect?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was the first person to sense something amiss; she had a direct channel to \u201cSetsuna,\u201d but even that was failing to garner any response!</p><br/><p>Most crucially, she was supposed to carry on with her wonderful travels through the literary world of \u201cWhite Clover.\u201d However, she soon faced an unprecedented situation!</p><br/><p>An exceptional situation!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Go rewatch the previous DLC\u2019s trailer and you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m right. That\u2019s right. They spared no effort in the character design and modeling in this upcoming DLC. The difference is huge! Who knows, which superstar did Feng Huo Gaming Company rope in\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think there can be no debate on what the main questline would be like. It would have everything to do with Yan Qingmeng. Who knew Taoist nuns could be so hot. Knowing how these love simulation games go, I would eat sh*t if we don\u2019t get some wholesome fanservice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKnowing sadistic Zha Feng\u2019s style, all their DLCs roll in with fixes and patches that almost always fix bugs and exploits. Be prepared to lose your shortcuts. Well, it can\u2019t be helped. Rumor has it that Zha Feng often browses through bilibili [1]. With so many superstars owning the game with their endless exploits, you guys should have been f*cking smarter about it! You are clearly reminding him to fix the bugs and to come up with more devious traps!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You called me a superstar? I am not one. I was not showing off when I made those walkthrough videos. I was just showing the easiest way to clear the stage, and to dig out in those hidden details to the limit\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After the Tale of WuXia 3\u2019s new DLC, \u201cThe Law of Humane Justice\u201d released an announcement, saying that it would focus on PC gaming and streaming optimization around late August. Many uploaders who made walkthrough videos were asked about their views regarding the new DLC. The above had been the response made to his viewers by an uploader named \u201cThe Kind Guide Maker\u201d during a live stream.</p><br/><p>Many viewers claimed that The Guide Maker was only digging his own grave. Zha Feng had always hidden a million tricks up his sleeves. Aren\u2019t you afraid of being slapped in the face when you make such a premature judgment prior to this DLC\u2019s release?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you kidding! I have already uncovered so many of old sly Zha Feng\u2019s tricks. How could I fall into his traps again? Of course, falling into Zha Feng\u2019s traps have always been enjoyable. Maybe we all are masochists. That\u2019s right, we totally are Hahaha. We would drag our balls through the desert for that one moment of accomplishment when you kill a boss and complete a quest. After all, as difficult as the game is, you\u2019ll get familiar to the boss once you\u2019ve died hundreds of times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Kind Guide Maker\u201d was bragging to his viewers in the Zhanqi live-streaming platform\u2019s videogame live streaming section. He was just a small live streamer. He was not even particularly skilled. That was why he declined the title \u2013 \u201csuperstar\u201d as some viewers had claimed. Rather than live-streaming walkthroughs or gameplays, he was a veteran live streamer when it came to \u201ca million ways to die in Tales of Wuxia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was his earnestness, or his various cringes and wincing twitches as he go tortured to death, coupled with his unyielding spirit that drew viewers to his streams. He eventually completed the \u201cTale of Wuxia 3\u201d via sheer perseverance, and firmly believed that this game was a classic amongst the classics. The key factor a player needed was to have a mind and heart of steel. They would have to abandon all thought and hope of survival, and resign to the fact that you can only improve by dying a million times.</p><br/><p>He then produced a video about his reviews towards the game and uploaded it to bilibili. This resonated with his kindred spirits who were experts at dying. They would feel that he knew the depth of their hearts to the most intimate detail</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, once you have played the Wuxia series, you would learn that they are just an extremely well-produced galgame [3] that is disguised as some triple-A title, backed by a massive budget. How could you not understand that the beautiful 18sx CG animation kept us all going? They would feel nothing, even if they die again and again for the girls,\u201d\u201dThe Kind Guide Maker\u201d had enthusiastically said.</p><br/><p>It was no doubt that he was a true fanboy of the series. He knew what the game was trying to convey, and what it really stood for. He even understood the differences between Zha Feng and other game producers. This was the reason behind his intense addiction.</p><br/><p>This was the niche appeal that everyone spoke of but never really understood. If they did not have the compatible determination and patience, they would forever remain \u201cviewers\u201d [4]. It would be a pleasant, peaceful experience for them; riding on the displeasure and discomfort of the streamer. It was a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Kind Guide Maker\u201d had recently been live-streaming gameplay footage of \u201cGetting Over It with Bennett Foddy.\u201d It had other names like \u201cGetting Over It\u201d and \u201cthe Yosemite Hammer game.\u201d He had been so thoroughly abused that he did not even know how many times he had started over from the beginning. He was so angry to the point that he shaved off his hair and became a baldy!</p><br/><p>In the end, that led him to becoming viral. Footage of his rage and anger while playing the game found its way to bilibili. The bullet screen [5] of the video was full of people cracking up!</p><br/><p>Such indie games were notoriously difficult. It was not known how many streamers were tortured until they were crazy. Many streamers from the live streaming section had even expressed that after playing the game, they felt that the old sly Zha Feng\u2019s large-scaled love simulation and dressing up game was much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Kind Guide Maker\u201d had a real name, and it was Wu Shun. He often satirized his own name in a way that implied that every gaming endeavor he attempts would surely end in failure. However, weren\u2019t the viewers happy to watch his numerous, raging reactions as he fumbles about and experiences death again and again?</p><br/><p>Several players truly enjoyed watching him suffer, his pain was their pleasure, his torment their bliss. If people loved watching Ah Yu skillfully slaughtering monsters, others would enjoy watching players like Wu Shun skillfully getting slaughtered</p><br/><p>However, Wu Shun unexpectedly used his immense determination to continuously play the game \u201cGetting Over It with Bennett Foddy\u201d for sixteen hours straight before finally completed it. At that moment, he had been so excited that he almost drop dead!</p><br/><p>Players like him would never be able to complete such game in three minutes. Completing it would be enough of an achievement. He had always been self-conscious about his own abilities when it came to the Tale of WuXia series. He would not challenge the impossible, for hard work would never be enough to pass over the hurdle.</p><br/><p>Many of his viewers acknowledged his determination, even if he lacked the skills. They were generous in providing him with waves of gifts.</p><br/><p>Even so the income received from live streaming hardly mattered. He was a beneficiary of expropriation compensation, [6] anyway. That was sufficient for him to live comfortably for the rest of his life. This left him enough time to play video games 24/7. The only reason he live streamed was to share his experiences with everyone. It did not if this did not earn him a single dime.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, I feel cute and adorable. I feel pretty good. I should be able to complete the game with my intuition if the DLC of Tales of Wuxia 3 is actually released today. Of course, I will be pursuing that lovely Taoist nun! Okay, let\u2019s call it a day for now.\u201d With that, Wu Shun stopped his live stream, pleased with himself.</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cBilibili\u201d (b) is a video sharing website themed around anime, manga, and game fandom based in China, where users can submit, view, and add commentary subtitles on videos.</p><br/><p>[2] \u201cZhanqi\u201d () is a game live-streaming platform.</p><br/><p>[3] \u201cGalgame\u201d is a type of Japanese video game centered on interactions with attractive girls\u201d.

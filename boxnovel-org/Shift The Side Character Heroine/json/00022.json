After all, she was not Xu Jing herself, but just shifting into her body. Her five senses shall never be affected by any peculiar circumstances, akin to the mangaka, she was an \u201cupstream person\u201d in the real world. Thus, she would not be hurt by the ridiculous big club as well. Anyway, never had she thought that Xu Jing\u2019s shirt was actually torn in that single blow\u2026</p><br/><p>She got really hot under the collar. Had the character she played, Xu Jing offended the mangaka in any way? She hoped for nothing other than relying on Xu Jing\u2019s passion and determination to engross in her studies. What was so difficult about that?</p><br/><p>Having calmed herself down after a while, a new perspective occurred to her. Indeed, she was quite impressed by this mangaka whose face was still obscure. The character of Xu Jing might be plagued with all sort of miseries, but that had actually made her image to be engraved on Zhao Youyue\u2019s mind, not to mention any other regular readers.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, a new volume of \u201cWing Manga\u201d magazine was published this week. What Youyue had undergone in the Two Dimensional World would most likely be published in that. For sure she would grab one to read. Meanwhile, she had also decided to approach this mangaka named \u201cSu Li\u201d via internet. If she could gather information of the mangaka in reality, that would be really pleasant.</p><br/><p>Did the mangaka really think that one would not be punished by karma for their ill-treating acts in the manga?</p><br/><p>Youyue would avenge her agony by locating the mangaka through the internet!</p><br/><p>She believed that the mangaka of a school Harem manga like this, must be drawn by a nasty wretched guy, who will remain single for his entire life. Indeed, this was her prejudice! She really despised such Harem plot where a guy is matched up with N[1] girls. Besides, the mangaka had provided fan services to the readers outrageously. She had dodged the Rito\u2019s fall, with safety pants put on, but eventually, she failed to dodge the shirt-tearing big club of the local government officer\u2026</p><br/><p>A deplorable male mangaka like this could already have a bone in his leg upon meeting girls. If he was lucky enough to be dated by a pretty-girl reader, would he turn down her invitation? Not likely. Wait till then, she would hire a professional to rendezvous with the mangaka.</p><br/><p>You dare to fool with me in the manga? Don\u2019t blame me if I set you up in reality!</p><br/><p>\u201cA Harem mangaka was arrested for involving in compensated dating[2] with a high school girl, his manga will be suspended for two weeks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Come forth, let\u2019s hurt each other!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Zhao Youyue would never stay as the losing party. In a sense, she was invincible in the world of literary works, as nobody could do her any harm. It was just that the mangaka would interfere with her acts, such as studying, and that was quite troublesome.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Youyue who had lost her drowsiness, unconsciously reached her hand towards her on-charge phone. As a cellphone complex, without holding her phone in her palms felt as if she had lost an essential part of her body. Once she has leisure time, she would definitely scroll her phone.</p><br/><p>There were a couple of Wechat notifications on her phone. She clicked on that just to realized they were all messages from Han Leng. At 12.00 AM, he sent a message of 1,000 words, and of course, it was not of love letter, but a remorse letter. At 1:30 AM, he sent another 1,000 words. His third message arrived at 2:30 AM, which carried the last 1,000 words.</p><br/><p>Never did it come to Zhao Youyue\u2019s mind that Han Leng had stayed up all night just to complete her 3,000-word remorse letter. How badly did he crave for the 200 bucks reward?</p><br/><p>After transferring the remorse letter, Han Leng had sent her a few more messages,</p><br/><p>\u201cTycoon, I\u2019m lucky to fulfill your request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve viewed your Moments stories too. Wow, you\u2019re a true missy from Zhao family. You\u2019ve been to so many countries; you\u2019ve owned many luxury bags; you\u2019ve also shared a lot of gourmet foods. At late midnight like this, that really made my stomach cry. Oh my itchy finger, shouldn\u2019t have click that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Zhao, you must be sleeping now. Goodnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking through his messages, Zhao Youyue smiled. It seems that her mood that had been ruined by the mangaka, was recovering. Without any talkings, she immediately sent Han Leng a 200-RMB Wechat red packet. She then carefully copied down the remorse letter onto a paper, and thus, there was no need for her to worry about her class teacher, Mr. Qiu anymore.</p><br/><p>Anyway, her red packet was at once accepted by Han Leng, who replied, \u201cWow, Lady Zhao, you\u2019re still awake? It seems that we are the same kind of people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng did not feel a shred of sleepiness upon completing the remorse letter. He then grab a webnovel and began his \u201ctraining to be an immortal\u201d [3]. He had trained until this hour.</p><br/><p>After that, he sent Zhao Youuyue an emoji sticker. It was a guy with black rim of eyes and is wearing a pair of panda ears. On top of the sticker, it was written, \u201cViva immortal training!\u201d Han Leng had measured the rest after himself, assuming Zhao Youyue was one \u201cimmortal practitioner\u201d like him.</p><br/><p>In fact, this could not be possible. Zhao Youyue had lived a disciplined lifestyle, and was particular about keeping fit and maintaining her skin care. Never had she put on any cosmetics that are harmful to the skin, instead, she had been using tip-top skin care products. If not, how could she have such a delicate skin?</p><br/><p>One\u2019s beauty is destined ever since she was born, but to preserve that beauty, continuous efforts are not to be missed. In terms of this, a girl with rich family background like Zhao Youyue has a huge advantage.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue might look average now, but wait until she entered university; if she kept a long hair, and changed her sports attire into something fashionable while carrying designer bags that is unaffordable by the ordinary people, she would immediately turn into a goddess who is adored by all men.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue replied, \u201cNope, but I was having a nightmare. o(\u2565\ufe4f\u2565)o \u201d</p><br/><p>She was in a luxury silk pajamas. After opening the room light, she walked towards the writing desk and opened the desk lamp. Taking out some white papers, she started copying down the remorse letter sent by Han Leng.</p><br/><p>Though Youyue had not been through any proper training for chinese calligraphy, her writings were elegant. With that, her exam papers were always clean and neat. Her essays had always been of the same old template, which is a sole major argument coupled with three supportive arguments, and the provided examples are none other than those mundane histories of famous people like Sun Bin, Sima Qian, Han Xin, Newton, Edison, Zhang Haidi, Shi Tiesheng, etc. Well, obviously her essay level was nowhere near Han Leng\u2019s. But at times, she could actually attain a great score through her neat exam papers that gave a decent impression to the exam markers.</p><br/><p>While bending over her desk and copying the remorse letter, Zhao Youyue felt as if she was possessed by Xu Jing. She could be that patient, and attentive.</p><br/><p>Knowing that Zhao Youyue was awakened by her nightmare, Han Leng was eager to reply with comforting words. But he was too bashful for that, and also, they were of nothing more than an exchange relationship. Still, wasn\u2019t that apathetic if he said nothing at all? Nah, he was always known to be such a cool guy!</p><br/><p>Han Leng was hesitating for over ten minutes, and had typed a lot of words. But he failed to press the \u201cSend\u201d button and deleted his message instead. He had repeated this routine of typing and deleting a couple of times\u2026 He was not aware that Zhao Youyue had been concentrating on copying the remorse letter. At last, he could only utter a few words, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue clicked into the message. Little did she know that it had taken so much of Han Leng\u2019s time just to type these few messages. She replied in a natural manner, \u201cI\u2019m fine. You should sleep by now. I\u2019ve to copy this remorse letter. Thank you very much (\uff3e\u03c9\uff3e)\u201d</p><br/><p>After reading her message, Han Leng did not reply further, as he did not want to disturb Zhao Youyue. He then got to his feet and walked to the bathroom. While washing his face, he looked at the dark circles around his eyes in the mirror, as well as his face filled of \u201cdivine aura\u201d. He then cracked a smile. After that, he abruptly opened the balcony door and stepped out, and gazed upon the entire school compound.</p><br/><p>The teaching building was solemnly standing in the darkness. Street lamps in the school compound were yellow. The dense fog was enveloping the whole place. The basketball field and sports field were empty. At that moment, he felt as if he was the sole person in this world. Ah, what a lonely feeling.</p><br/><p>As for now, he had this feeling that he wanted to do some handwritings. Nothing much, just to record something in a book filled with his poet and proser dreams. That book, was his secret diary.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cN\u201d is contemporarily used by Chinese to refer to a great number.

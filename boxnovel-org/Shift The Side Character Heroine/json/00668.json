She had her own methods of mixing with friends from different classes.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was just an illusion. Yes, she was friendly, but it was impossible for anyone to walk into her heart.</p><br/><p>Despite this powerful aura, admirers with stronger wills still attempted to court her.</p><br/><p>This was not bravery. This was not persistence. This was folly. It was a norm for Lady Zhao to receive at least one banquet of flower every week. She would never learn of its sender\u2019s name. Perhaps, the hoped that Lady Zhao would find out who it was when the flower-gifting stopped.</p><br/><p>It was an expensive way to court a girl, especially for a university student. Each banquet would cost a considerable sum of money, say, RMB 100 to 200?</p><br/><p>Such tricks were ineffective against Lady Zhao. She had been socializing with people of all walks of life, era, continents, and worlds for decades. She would not act like some sweet and naive daughter of the rich, would she?</p><br/><p>Of course, this would never happen to Lady Zhao!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue dismissed the flowers, sharing the fragrance of freshly pluck flowers with the other girls in the dormitory. She rarely stayed in the room, but her three roommates certainly benefitted greatly from her gifts.</p><br/><p>Ladies who were good with men would often be ostracized by their own kind. Zhao Youyue was an exception. She was good with both men and women.</p><br/><p>You\u2019ll never have to worry about her facing problems from them. To womankind, Lady Zhao was like a kind and gentle elder sister who excelled at everything. In other words, she was their goddess!</p><br/><p>She was simply far too talented. Ladies did not have the right to be jealous of the special treatment she received. Also, she was powerful and influential, making an enemy out of her would be most unwise.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue brought a new definition to being single. It was freedom and bliss. She could start her own love story anytime she wanted.</p><br/><p>A new semester had begun. No matter how precious Zhao Youyue was, she was not the only thing that mattered at that moment.</p><br/><p>In Zhao Youyue\u2019s hostel, Yu Xuefei announced her relationship with a guy. She had been the first to have a boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei did not choose the engineering student who had dinner with her, prior to this. He was merely a backup. She always had her eyes on the handsome literature student, regardless of how bad his reputation was. Compared to the dull engineering student, he was much more fun and interesting.</p><br/><p>After Yu Xuefei announced her relationship, the engineering guy had indulged himself in alcohol, finished a whole carton of beer in just a short while. Drunk and frustrated, he had dragged himself to Yu Xuefei\u2019s hostel. He was too weak to remain standing and fell flat on his face. He had mustered the last of his strength and had yelled into thin air, hoping that Yu Xuefei would hear him and choose him instead!</p><br/><p>He believed that his love was true, and that Yu Xuefei was his first, true love. A relationship should last until the hand of marriage was given. Otherwise, it was robbery. Robbery of time and love. The engineering guy was an honest man. Never once had he allowed Yu Xuefei to pay for their dates\u2026As for the charming literature student, he was just another Casanova of love. Romance was merely a tool for him to create the delusion of affection, charming the ladies as if they were in love. Once he was bored of them, he would ditch them like pieces of trash.</p><br/><p>It was He Weiwei who had informed Zhao Youyue of this. Zhao Youyue did not pay attention to such rumors. Her heart was fully invested in \u201cthe presidential election of student union.\u201d Her goal was crystal clear \u2014 to be the next president of the student union.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue rarely ever stayed in the hostel. Now that she had learned of this, she could not help but ask Yu Xuefei, \u201cFeifei, do you really like the literature guy? What was his name again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei answered Zhao Youyue courteously, \u201cI do not like him at all. He\u2019 Wang Xiaoning, a third-year student. He is the most handsome guy in literature faculty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue understood the game that Yu Xuefei was playing. They did not plan to be together for long. Love was merely a romantic sparring partner in bed for their university life. Everything was just an act of two players\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue remained silent. He Weiwei started to pry, \u201cSince you do not like Wang Xiaoning, why would you want to be his girlfriend? He has a bad reputation with countless of ex-girlfriends. Rumor has it that some even went through abortion for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei was not concerned at all, \u201cI think he is fun. He knows how to talk, and how to enjoy life. Being with him is most exciting and relaxing. I only wanted his romance and surprises. Plus, he is handsome and rich. It is an honor to have such a boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apparently, He Weiwei thoughts differed from Yu Xuefei. She thought that Yu Xuefei had just been too careless. How could she become his girlfriend, if she did not like him at all?</p><br/><p>He Weiwei intended to prolong the debate, but Zhao Youyue quickly stepped in. It was useless to argue with a person with a different perspective.</p><br/><p>However, Yu Xuefei added, \u201cThere is no true love in this world. I would not trust any man with anything else, I only want to see how good they could get at pleasing me. What about you girls?\u201dThe silent Zhou Cai finally spoke up, \u201cI have my games to please me. Men? I do not need them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei noticed that Zhao Youyue had not commented on her topic, so she tried to drag her into the discussion. \u201cI learned this from Lady Zhao. Lady Zhao does not need a boyfriend, yet you are enjoying yourself as the star loved by everyone, are you not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue spoke softly, \u201cIt seems like you misunderstood me. I am busy with a lot of things on hand, and I do not use men to please me. Perhaps I think the one who could bring much joy to me would be a young lady\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cirilla sprang up in her mind. Her source world sister indeed filled her heart with warmth and joy.</p></div>\n</div>"}

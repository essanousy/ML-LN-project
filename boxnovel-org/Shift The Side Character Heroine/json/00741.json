It accurately depicted the daily life of a female scientist in a misogynistic field of work. It was the imminence of disaster that shot Zhang Yanwei\u2019s reputation sky-high!</p><br/><p>At the beginning of the apocalypse, when the social order had not yet collapsed, people would still be of sound mind. They could even continue criticizing about national affairs on the internet. When they finally learn that the internet could no longer be used\u2026</p><br/><p>Disaster struck like a dagger in the night. People lost their lives before they even had the chance to bootlick the beautiful Zhang Yanwei.</p><br/><p>Regular folk who were owners of not very clean houses would find disgusting cockroaches that were once the size of nails to have turned into the size of palms. They even released acidic liquid that burned through everything. They gathered in crowds and groups, just like the scarabs in the film \u201cMummy.\u201d Humans were now food to them!</p><br/><p>Even Master PhD had to walk away from her work desk, right after writing such disgusting imagery. Evolved cockroaches were just the beginning. Readers had much more cause to tremble in fear as their eyes took in her words.</p><br/><p>Palm-sized cockroaches were not as terrifying as dog-sized mice. Mice that never dared brave the sunlight, but now chased after humans like prey. Was this karma? Is the predator being the prey?</p><br/><p>What if those creatures already caused harm in their base state, like flies and mosquitos? Now they were absolutely horrifying. Villagers would never live in peace again, if they were even living. Perhaps one only needed to open the door, and they would be sucked dry by giant mosquitoes!</p><br/><p>If this drastic change had not been so\u2026 drastic, humans might have been able to adapt accordingly. Unity, pooling of resources and power. But this was just mindblowing. Leaders at the top level were dropping dead. The most bizarre incidents were occurring to them, like a sparrow suddenly turning manic, for instance. Its beak was suddenly powerful enough to tear through the human ribcage and rip its contents out.</p><br/><p>These were nothing natural about this apocalypse. And we\u2019re not talking about the meteor shower. It\u2019s what on the meteors \u2014 some sort of alien, extra-terrestrial virus that might even be a biological weapon from an alien empire\u2026</p><br/><p>Humanity did not even have the time to wonder what the heck even happened \u2014 they were too busy struggling to survive.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yanwei remained at ease, as she knew that she was merely living in the novel. She even had the reason to believe that the intoxicated Master PhD would never write her to death so easily\u2026</p><br/><p>Therefore, unless Zhang Yanwei went to seek for death herself, she would not be permitted to die so easily.</p><br/><p>Actually, Zhang Yanwei originally intended to be a great retaliatory villain, to rise above the call of duty and even oppose the Endless Squad. Later, she realized that such a character would not possibly even be recognized by readers, let alone be an iconic character.</p><br/><p>She even felt that the \u201cvillain turning over a new leaf\u201d trend was foolproof\u2026</p><br/><p>She decided to be a villain on the surface. When the truth is revealed at the end of the story, readers would finally learn that she was actually humanity\u2019s true savior. However, within the literary world, she might have to be misunderstood for her lifetime. She had to become the shameful pole within history, the greatest human traitor!</p><br/><p>There was no other character more unforgettable than such a villainous character, nor would there be any plot more depressive. We could up the ante by having her actually save the world, yet having no one figure out the inside story, even long after the act. They would only crouch in the corner, bitterly blaming her for their current predicament!</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, self-righteous people would pop up, adding trouble to the villain who was saving the world. If these disruptive, self-righteous people had not shown up, the villain might have been able to do even better!</p><br/><p>It was obvious that Master PhD had a full picture of Zhang Yanwei in her head. From the beginning, apart from shaping her into the earnest, aspirant scientist, Master PhD had also applied some casual foreshadowings to depict her mad, mysterious side. She seemed to be coaxing the readers, telling them that this beautiful scientist was not as simple as she looked. She knew something that the others did not!</p><br/><p>Whereas she actually knew about the inside story, knowing that the apocalypse was coming, yet she had deliberately withheld that information. Instead, she only cared about herself and kept to her own preparations for the apocalypse. What a selfish person she was.</p><br/><p>Master PhD was able to depict a lively, true beauty scientist with just a few sentences. While many readers sighed at those beautiful words, they were also furiously criticizing this scientist\u2019s selfishness, one after another\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Zhang Yanwei definitely has issues. If the Endless Squad wants to harvest more from this global evolutionary apocalypse world, they would have to do something about her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly can\u2019t understand it. If she actually knew that the disaster is coming, why didn\u2019t she disclose the information generously? Countless people could have been saved. I suspect that Zhang Yanwei definitely has something to do with the source virus that caused the apocalypse\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. As a top scientist, if she said that apocalypse is coming, more people would take it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t necessarily so. If Hawking said that all creatures of the entire planet would turn into super mutants after a meteor shower, would anyone truly believe in such nonsense? This is truly unscientific!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhang Yanwei is one mysterious creature. Something tells me that the Endless Squad would attempt to recruit her into their ranks. Did I mention that Megane Chu Xuan is ridiculously handsome! Even now he\u2019s still as analytical as ever, looking at the world go to shit with his cold, calculated logic, as if the apocalypse is just another simple puzzle to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhang Yanwei and Chu Xuan are going to clash and generate sparks. Master PhD is going to deliver. Tycoon Youyue\u2019s had been right to recommend such a Godly book. She has amazing taste. There is no end to the surprise when paying attention to Tycoon Youyue\u2019s book list\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>From those responses alone, Zhang Yanwei, who had started off as a passerby character within the teaser and even according to Master PhD\u2019s plan had become a key character. Even readers expected her to pull many more tricks out her sleeves, while also invoking major plot twists.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

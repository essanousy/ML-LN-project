Plus, this Master PhD was beautiful and talented.</p><br/><p>After Su Li took a good look and felt that she was not as beautiful as she was, and her legs are short, she was positive that Lady Zhao would never be attracted to girls lesser than her.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Zhao Youyue would not fall in love with any girl at first sight, but she did choose to forgive Master PhD for not keeping her promise. Still, it did not mean that her heart would be absolutely devoid of malice.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue apparently believed that Chu Xuan, a template character, had the potential to be iconic. \u201cZhang Yanwei\u201d did not have a template to follow, so she could only depend on her own effort. If readers did not take notice of all her hard work, why continue?</p><br/><p>Master PhD had forced Zhao Youyue\u2019s hand. She had now been forced onto the gambling table.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue preferred obedient authors like Su Li. It was not like she did not give the authors any chance whatsoever, all she wanted was for both parties to be in a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Zhao Youyue was confident that the male \u201cChu Xuan\u201d might just surpass the original \u201cChu Xuan.\u201d Master PhD had tried her best to write about the interaction between men and women which had only resulted in a lot of neck pain. So it was up to Zhao Youyue and her \u201cpasserby\u201d approach.</p><br/><p>Therefore, this was a one-time deal with Master PhD. On the other hand, Su Li was now a crucial part of Lady Zhao\u2019s life. Su Li had changed her fate by falling in love with Lady Zhao, like a Cinderella, or a Prince to be more precise. Their love story should be interesting.</p><br/><p>Su Li sat across Master PhD, her nerves calm. Now she was the top author in comics, who was chatting and laughing along with the most respected authors in online literature. All of them hoped to work with her, For example, the king of online novels, Tang Jia San Shao was famous for his \u201cSaint Land.\u201d[1] Several young readers thought that it was a classic.</p><br/><p>Tang Jia San Shao, of course, wanted to work with a top-class mangaka like Su Li. This was a big catch for Su Li. Fans would go crazy over it. Knowing Su Li\u2019s past, she would accept such an invitation without hesitation. It was almost like being hired as a football team\u2019s assistant. On the surface, Su Li might be one of the coaches, but she was actually accompanied by assistants to the left and right.</p><br/><p>Besides, it was a common thing to hire assistants for the lighter parts. Many mangakas had their personal studios, and of course, those studios housed several assistants. A good anime would not be done by a single illustrator. It was a collective effort by a studio.</p><br/><p>Ever since Su Li got the title Su, The Great Deity, each stroke of her brush carried substantial work. As per Lady Zhao\u2019s instructions, she had transformed her work, making it even more compelling and worth discussing.</p><br/><p>Yes, \u201cSaint Land\u201d was popular at the moment, but it was like fast food, loved only by the young ones. It could generate a lot of money, but there was a visible ceiling to it. Mature readers would refuse to read anything that resembled \u201cSaint Land.\u201d Their first reaction would be \u201d you must be new here\u201d or \u201care you a puppy or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>If Su Li was going to draw for \u201cSaint Land,\u201d she would do it from the shadows. She published numerous female character that were always featured in the top selection of the most attractive female character\u2019s charts. Fans would fight to make sure that their \u201cwaifus\u201d end up at the top.</p><br/><p>Su Li hoped that her cartoons and paintings would generate such fandom. Let\u2019s have people say that \u201cSu Li\u2019s productions are classics.\u201d Of course, Su Li\u2019s fans were currently saying things like \u201d The Death Scythe trails closely by in Su Li\u2019s wake.\u201d Every character she draws would not end well. Most remarkable was how an author was sent to heaven by the mysterious force of Su, The Great Deity.</p><br/><p>Master PhDs was clearly excited to meet Su Li, a top God cartoonist. Lady Zhao must have her own reasons bringing Su Li to see her.</p><br/><p>Master PhD knew of Su Li, Su, The Great Deity \u2018s mysterious power. On the other hand, Master PhD was famous for being absolutely ruthless to her characters. She did not care about polls and popularity. If she did not like them, they\u2019ll be deleted, regardless of what readers thought!</p><br/><p>Her actions always drew a considerable amount of fuss, yet she did not even care if she lost all her fans. Still, she would take an occasional glance at the comment section. The death threats did give her the shivers.</p><br/><p>While she remained headfast in her writing, she sometimes got worried about the readers\u2019 wrath. That did not matter to her, but it also meant that she would not be getting an \u201cAuthor of the year\u201d award anytime soon.</p><br/><p>Master PhDs was a simple author. She was not really good at all the convoluted plotline build up. Some readers noted that her plot was too way too clunky, hence nicknames such as \u201cThe Promises of Men.\u201d It was an obvious peduncle.</p><br/><p>Now that she was Su Li, her hopes suddenly shot up. This was a very beautiful trashcan for her to dump all her trash. At that moment, she truly wanted to thank Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>If Su Li knew that she was a garbage bin in the eyes of an ancient god author, she might have jumped off a tall building. Obviously, drawing for the \u201cEndless Apocalypse\u201d would be out of the question! Unless Lady Zhao asked her in bed\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Tang Jia San Shao () was a homonym for .

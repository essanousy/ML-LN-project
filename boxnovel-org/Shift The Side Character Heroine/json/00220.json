They would not have the time to guide him, the least they could do is to let him \u201crefer\u201d to their homework.</p><br/><p>But Zhao Youyue was different; nobody knows what is hidden underneath her mask, except for Han Leng. He always wanted to know how this Lady Zhao manages to get her good grades, especially when she is such a slacker.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was laid back to begin with, and ever since she became a top ten student, her attitude only worsened. She would grab any opportunity to play with her phone during recess, so what if she is caught by the teacher red-handed?</p><br/><p>\u201cI can guarantee to make it to the top ten. When the science exams remain as they are, without any of those competition format questions, I can even shake the position of Wang Zongchao, can you guys do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Welcome to the class, where good grades are everything\u2026</p><br/><p>But Zhao Youyue was still afraid of her homeroom teacher, so she did not dare to be that arrogant during Mr. Qiu\u2019s class, but still, she would play with her phone underneath her desk.</p><br/><p>Of course, she had been caught by Mr. Qiu a few times, but Mr. Qiu did not confiscate her phone like last time, nor did he ask her to write an apology letter\u2026</p><br/><p>Mr. Qiu believed that simple and diligent Zhao Youyue was using her phone to check for information to increase her knowledge.</p><br/><p>Woah, no wonder Zhao Youyue is the elite student representative of his class, such self-motivation!</p><br/><p>If everyone can learn from Zhao Youyue, he could worry less about this class!</p><br/><p>Her grades have spoken on her behalf, the \u201cXu Jing card\u201d had definitely changed her high school life.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had studied hard, so she has the time to play with her phone even more. However, most people lacked determination. They were all too aware that good grades would grant them a lot of leeway, but they could find it in them to improve their studies.</p><br/><p>Well, besides getting good grades, they would have to at least maintain their places at the top ten positions in the whole school, or the top three in class, or else they would still have to obey school rules, without any privileges.</p><br/><p>For an excellent student like Zhao Youyue, as long as she does not affect others in their studies, she could do whatever she wants.</p><br/><p>Many students were mistaken about Zhao Youyue, because there was a rumor going about Zhao Youyue that said she was from a poor family, and that she was a strong-willed elite scholar; she would do house chores while studying!</p><br/><p>Of course, Mr. Qiu was willing to publicize Zhao Youyue in such a way; he can never let her true nature be known. What would happen to the other students, if a lazy person like her still manage to get good grades?</p><br/><p>Mr. Qiu had also decided to separate Zhao Youyue from her deskmate, Jiang Qing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was a bad influence on the little angel, Jiang Qing. A committee of art like her already had little interest in studying; now she was mixing in with Lady Zhao who only waits for the holidays during the weekend, so that she could follow Zhao Youyue to a great meal, tea time and even movies\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing had even considered to surrender herself to Lady Zhao for the rest of her life!</p><br/><p>Since Lady Zhao had taken a liking to her, she would agree to anything easily.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing\u2019s heart was nowhere near studying, and that was causing her grades to fall, while Zhao Youyue continued to excel. She never noticed that Jiang Qing\u2019s grades were going through a steep fall. Now, Jiang Qing and Han Leng were the same, one of the former top ten students. Emphasis on former.</p><br/><p>Deep down, Zhao Youyue was not one of those arrogant, excellent students. Many of the excellent students loved to compare their answers whenever a test is finished, and they would usually lie that they messed up in the test. But when the results are announced, they would smile at their own results and ask the other excellent students for their results\u2026</p><br/><p>Before the teacher reveals their ranking, they would already predict their own rankings, and they like to compare their exam results with their deskmates. If their deskmate is a student with a bad grade, they would feel all the more haughty.</p><br/><p>The top student study group that Zhao Youyue joined had many such students. This excluded Wang Zongchao, who never bothered about other people\u2019s grades, because none of them was better than him.</p><br/><p>Of course, Wang Zongchao could not take his eyes off Lady Zhao. He would feel the pressure when he is facing Zhao Youyue, because her grades were a threat to him. But still, he felt that he retained an advantage over her, because he has entered mathematics and physics competitions, while Zhao Youyue has never participated in any of those.</p><br/><p>Little did he know that if Zhao Youyue manages to get the gold medal in the provincial violin competition, the school would definitely grab this opportunity to publicize her success this was called the \u201cQuality Education Achievement,\u201d because her school emphasized on quality education, and it affected the reform of the nation\u2019s education culture as a whole.</p><br/><p>Mathematics and physics competitions were a given for excellent students to participate in, and Zhao Youyue who took part in a violin competition would be a special case, because it is usually the art students who took part in those. Not many can play a musical instrument yet also excel in their studies, not even students from music schools.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue actually set a very bad example, if her deskmate is not strong-willed enough, he or she would definitely be \u201ccorroded\u201d!</p><br/><p>There is a saying, \u201cHardwork does not necessarily grant success, but not working hard is definitely easier,\u201d becoming the deskmate of Lady Zhao, following her path of a stress-free life, without the help of \u201cXu Jing\u2019s card\u201d and 200% effort on learning, would d*mn a person!</p><br/><p>So, on Saturday, the little angel, Jiang Qing almost cried when she lost her status as Lady Zhao\u2019s deskmate! Her seat was now the closest to the blackboard, and her every single movement was under the supervision of all teachers!</p><br/><p>Chen Haoran helped Mr. Qiu carry Han Leng\u2019s desk over, and thus, Han Leng now became the deskmate of Zhao Youyue. Chen Haoran and Han Leng had been mercilessly separated by Mr. Qiu!</p><br/><p>On that day, Han Leng and Zhao Youyue have gone on leave, so Mr. Qiu quickly arranged their seats before they could oppose. He knew very well that Zhao Youyue would protest she was very close to Jiang Qing\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Haoran was envious of Han Leng, because he had become the deskmate of Zhao Youyue under the command of Mr. Qiu!</p><br/><p>But he changed his mind, Han Leng was an acquaintance to Zhao Youyue too; he could get close to Zhao Youyue through Han Leng, even getting Han Leng to speak of nice things about him to Zhao Youyue\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing stared at the messy desk of Han Leng with a grudge, as if they were now mortal enemies. A girl named Zhou Fang also stared at that table with a hateful expression; she was Zhao Youyue\u2019s first deskmate!</p>\n</div>"}

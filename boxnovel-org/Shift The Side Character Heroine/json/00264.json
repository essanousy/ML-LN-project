Or rather, this meal was prepared by her wife, Xu Jing. It was a scrumptious one.</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue ate her homecooked meal, she felt the need of obtaining a character card with maxed out cooking skills, it would be great. Other than playing her phone, a delicious meal was one of the things that Zhao Youyue would care for the most.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue wanted to eat an aphrodisiac meal that would literally glow before her eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>There is a saying that made perfect sense; everything can be forsaken, except for love and good food.</p><br/><p>The other fantasy was the \u201cEmpress dream\u201d that Zhao Youyue once had, but unfortunately, the random nature of the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d had to put a wedge between her dreams. Zhao Youyue had entered the world of anti-Russian warfare with a reckless abandonment that tore it apart within itself.</p><br/><p>So now, before Zhao Youyue enters the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d she would not dare to wish for a specific world. Keep her expectations low, and she would be spared the disappointment.</p><br/><p>Before that, she had sought to enter an entertainment world, so that she could acquire a singing skill. What she expected least was to finally acquire the powers of a stronger and more talented musician. It was Goddess Chu who came to her in a romantic novel that involved classical music!</p><br/><p>With Goddess Chu\u2019s card in hand, Zhao Youyue would not have to worry about not accomplishing anything in life. Chu Luoxun had the ability to compose great pieces. With this ability, she could write lyrics and compose music on her own. She could easily choose to earn a living with this musical talent of hers.</p><br/><p>In her mind, many forms of good music had yet to exist in the current world. If she lacked the ability to compose or even gain her bearings in the realm of music, she would never be able to even copy or emulate a Jay Chou song. If only she is the main protagonist of a particular novel, she could get hold of a professional to listen to her singing, and allow that professional to compose a song for her.</p><br/><p>It was a cheap stunt, and one that would draw suspicion with ease. How could an unknown pull out such a masterpiece from her pocket?</p><br/><p>But now Zhao Youyue did not have to worry about such problems; she did not want to use these songs to gain profit, she simply wanted to share her love of music with the world; just like Chu Luoxun and her music, she wanted everyone to feel happy.</p><br/><p>Only Chu Luoxun had such an amazing talent; she could create her original song, and Zhao Youyue could only take the reference from the soul that she has taken in.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue decided to broadcast a live stream that night, since playing games was one of her many ways of reducing stress; although it wasn\u2019t any different from playing her phone.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao gave off the vibe of an otaku, even when she is out traveling, it would just be akin to her changing the location of her phone, while taking photos of herself and posting it on social network to make it appear as if she had a fulfilling holiday\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was prepared to let her wife, little fish come out for a breather; and now she was at the point of being a contender of the top. She was getting more viewers visiting her live streaming room to see her gaming skills. Now, she needed more time to find a suitable or new game to play. At times, she would turn off her Yu Shengfan card and start communicating with the audience; she found it all rather interesting.</p><br/><p>To become a streamer, one must be an eloquent speaker. There\u2019s no way that a streamer can just remain quiet and play games, right? In order to become a popular streamer, one must have their personal flair and quirk.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s soothing voice was very popular among the crowd, many of them would even ask her to stop playing \u201cLoL\u201d, and talk to the audience instead! Becoming a big sister for everyone would be nice\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue had to activate her Yu Shengfan card to play, or else her subpar standards would be a hindrance to everyone else, she would never become the number one national player without the help of her iconic character card.</p><br/><p>Whenever she activates Yu Shengfan card, her behavior would change, drastically!</p><br/><p>Some audience enjoyed this jarring switch, but some audience did not approve of this Ah Yu whenever she plays a game, as she would treat her opponents harshly.</p><br/><p>A venomous tongue is not a moe trait in the reality, it only made people furious\u2026 but if little fish does not chatter or hurls out her characteristic verbal abuse, her stream could end up dull, this was an unsolvable, endless loop.</p><br/><p>Just like the elite scholar card, Xu Jing had different configurations, such as her \u201cTri no\u201d mode, and her \u201cPoker face\u201d mode. Only Goddess Chu was full of positive energy, and she had many ways of laughing, a girl who enjoyed laughing would be more likely to become popular, compared to a girl with a poker face, right?</p><br/><p>For today\u2019s live streaming, Zhao Youyue decided to send Goddess Chu out as well; and sang a few songs for everyone, including \u201cSouth Mountain\u201d a perfect rendition of it this time. With the help of Chu Luoxun, she was not afraid of not doing the songs justice\u2026</p><br/><p>She had a feeling that her channel would soon go viral. After all, this room had a gaming professional, Yu Shengfan, a talented musician, Chu Luoxun, and the gentle and heartwarming Lady Zhao who was good at socializing with the audience. It would be peculiar if this channel does not go viral.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue usually started her live streams at night, but it was still evening at that moment, the weather was rather warn, so she decided to stay in her room with the air conditioner turned on. She felt like doing something because she could not sit still, but there was nothing that she could do at that moment.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Han Leng had sent a text via Wechat. He seemed most agitated over something -\u201cLady Zhao, my best friend Chen Haoran, he is being ridiculous! He had just lost his love, and I went to comfort him with good intentions, but he, he\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue saw this message, she imagined the scenery of the straight guy, Chen Haoran meeting up with the lady boss Leng Zi. A broad, nefarious grim formed on her face. Yes, she needed to know how this best friend/romantic encounter plays out.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was loyal to his friend, and he would look down on every woman. After realizing that his female appearance would cast aside almost 70% of womankind, he had grown even more full of himself! However, he had forgotten a very important factor, if he found his other self beautiful, how would other males feel about it?!</p><br/><p>In this modern era, gender is not a problem, as long as the person is beautiful!</p><br/><p>If you were given a choice to pick a pretty boy and an ugly girl, an average person would surely pick the pretty boy!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Scholar Han, don\u2019t leave me hanging here. I\u2019m very interested to know what happened to the both of you over the past few days\u2026\u201d Zhao Youyue replied him almost instantly, bolting upright in anticipation.</p><br/><p>A cat seemed to have caught this eloquent writer\u2019s tongue, or he was simply overwhelmed at the moment. He simply could not find the right words to describe the events that have unfolded between Chen Haoran and himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Perhaps her choice in life to pursue the illustrator\u2019s brush had earned her a lot more points from Zhao Youyue. It reminded her of her bestie, Su Li.</p><br/><p>However, that Yuan Shawu had been taken out of the picture. The moment Zhao Youyue showed up, that entire world line had been thrown out the window.</p><br/><p>As there weren\u2019t any pesky authors around, Zhao Youyue was free to act any way she wanted. She did not even consider carrying on with the incorrigible otaku younger sister act. Let\u2019s not even mention how she could barely tolerate such a low sense of existence. No matter the world, she had to be the protagonist!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue first tidied Yuan Shawu\u2019s room up. Eventually, she had moved out to the living room, and the entire house. It was not even remotely recognizable from its old self!</p><br/><p>One might doubt. Zhao Youyue was a Lady. Was she even capable of house chores?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not forget. Zhao Youyue had access to every character card she had ever earned. Never forget Xu Jing.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Zhao Youyue had almost infinite stamina at the moment, as her personal combat power was quite possibly the best in this world. Never forget swordmaster Jane Doe Su. Now, Zhao Youyue could fight against a bunch of people by herself, as long as the opposing side did not actually have modern firearms.</p><br/><p>Anyway, in a cultural entertainment kind of source world where personal combat power was average, the world would generally be rather peaceful. Everyone was putting effort into enriching the culture of all ethnicities. Fighting and killing were truly too disharmonious. And Zhao Youyue was not some belligerent punch-drunk either. She would not lash out on a whim.</p><br/><p>It was Saturday. The second-rate, regular high school where Yuan Shawu studied was still in the midst of its holidays. Yuan Shawu was alone at home. Her brother was still at university.</p><br/><p>In his campus, Yuan Zhengzong was a ghost. Almost no one knew that he was a light novelist. But for some reason, on that day, a beautiful senior named Qiu Yuting suddenly came to him and uncovered him as a light novelist. She then introduced herself as a fan\u2026</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong was struck dumb. How did this beautiful senior even end up as a fan? Eventually, he was forcefully dragged to dinner. This had caused him to forget about his younger sister at home.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong could not help it. He had basically zero rejection skills. He was very gentle, too gentle for his own good at times, and he sincerely enjoyed helping others. He was not exactly a heartthrob hunk, but he had the looks that one could find pleasant as time is spent. It is extremely hard to find his looks repulsive in any way. Perhaps it was a combination of all these traits that drew these unique, self-confident girls to his side.</p><br/><p>Girls these days were not particularly picky when it came to faces. As long as a guy was not too ugly, that would be fine. But of course, despite those claims, the higher, the better. If the guy had a good temper, patience, talents, etc, he would undoubtedly be the rage at the market.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong had not yet become the rage, only because he was too low-key. His fashion sense was unique, so to speak. They were old-fashioned and outdated.</p><br/><p>Also, he did not showcase his identity as a light novelist. Such an identity would have been enough to have girls worship him. If only they knew. As things were, nobody was going to spare him a second glance.</p><br/><p>Not like any of this mattered to him. His mind was only filled with thoughts for his younger sister. Without his younger sister, he would completely lose his spiritual pillar, including the very definition of his life. His younger sister drove him to better himself, even if it\u2019s at the cost of her own progress. She had become a good-for-nothing, incorrigible otaku due to all his doting\u2026</p><br/><p>So here came the problem. No one cared to ask about him, so why would this beautiful senior named \u201cQiu Yuting\u201d take the initiative to come to him?</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting was quite popular on campus. She was mostly known for her singing. She was able to enjoy the limelight at every evening party. At one point, she had even received the first place among the top 10 best singers in college.</p><br/><p>In short, this Qiu Yuting was a big shot. Unfortunately, there were no school flower sort of elections in this university. If not, there would definitely be a space for Qiu Yuting on the school flower ranking list.</p><br/><p>Therefore, no matter the perspective, Qiu Yuting should not intersect Yuan Zhengzong whatsoever. She was arrogant, even. Why would she take the initiative to meet Yuan Zhengzong?</p><br/><p>The most unlikely reason would most often be the most truthful.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting was a reincarnated, in every sense of the word, unlike Zhao Youyue, who had only viewed one world line.</p><br/><p>Before Qiu Yuting \u2018awoke,\u2019 she had confidently barged into the entertainment industry. However, she could not hold a candle to those experts you see on talent show competitions\u2026</p><br/><p>Therefore, her journey to becoming a star was full of ups and downs. Even before her awakening, she had not been some sort of superstar. Perhaps this had something to do with her character. She would never boot-lick a single soul, not to mention being a drinking partner, or accepting unspoken rules.</p><br/><p>After she entered the entertainment industry, she felt as if she had been born anew. She did not belong to herself anymore, nor did many treat her as human anymore. She felt as if she was a toy, stripped bare and naked for the world to view.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, as she was at her lowest, she bumped into Yuan Zhengzong, who already held a spot in the writers\u2019 circle. He had even been fortunate enough to be a scenarist. He had been the scenarist for the MV plot of one of Qiu Yuting\u2019s title songs. That was how the two of them met, and how she had learned that they attended the same university\u2026</p><br/><p>They had been drawn together by fate, simple as that. Qiu Yuting could not help but pour her grievances onto Yuan Zhengzong. Well, his gentleness could take just about everything.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting felt that she had truly fallen in love for the first time. She did not know what exactly drew her to him. She only knew that with him, she would be able to walk out of this crater!</p><br/><p>Sometimes, she even regretted it. Why had she not met such a perfect guy like Yuan Zhengzong any sooner\u2026?</p><br/><p>As Qiu Yuting\u2019s understanding about Yuan Zhengzong grew, she realized that he was truly the rage at the market. Unfortunately, he happened to have set his mind onto his good-for-nothing, incorrigible otaku younger sister, as she was his one and only family member. No one could displace her from her heart, where she did not actually belong anyway.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting was still contemplating on a method of winning Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s heart. She had never expected to be a reincarnated. Most crucially, she remembered certain iconic songs from another world line\u2026</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting felt, she knew that she was going to be famous!</p><br/><p>She would yield a truly bountiful harvest in both her love and career!</p><br/><p>After all, Yuan Zhengzong was still in a state where no one cared to ask about him\u2026 No one would fight her, except Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s good-for-nothing younger sister.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The internet is going to rear its ugly head. Prepare yourself, little Zhao. The rumors will come.\u201d Ding Yuncong shook his head, murmuring to himself, \u201cCareless, careless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was deeply sorry. He was notorious for his relationships and his ideology of \u201cno marriages.\u201d Without a marriage, nobody could lecture him about who he chose to date.</p><br/><p>Some might criticize his superficial judgment of beauty, yet he admired the typical faces of internet celebrities. He intended to make his own group of celebrities.</p><br/><p>It was crude to do so, if already married, even if it was a common activity for the wealthy people.</p><br/><p>Both parties were simply fulfilling the desires of their hearts. After being crushed by his first love, Ding Yuncong has no grudge over the details.</p><br/><p>There was no need to get serious with women. They were just tools for pleasure.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong never intended to keep his relationships under the cover. Ironically, he was still being happily worshipped as the \u201cHusband of the nation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was the opposite. She had a fair reputation on the internet. The untainted reputation had forged her an image of a saint. No, she did not need any decorations. She was an angelic saint by birth.</p><br/><p>Many doubted this fact, and had tried to look for crumbs of her dark side. She feared nothing, as she had done nothing wrong. There were no crumbs at all.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue lived a simple life. Unlike those playful youths from wealthy families, she had no complicated relationships.</p><br/><p>While others used their time to play about, she used hers to enhance her talents. It was a justifiable explanation, as there was no other way to explain her achievements in music!</p><br/><p>The truth that nobody knew, was that she loved to play her phone in a quiet corner.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong strongly believed in that well-disciplined persona of Zhao Youyue, and was deeply impressed by it. A few too many girls would say one thing but do the other. Lin Shiya was a perfect example \u2013 and she served as a perfect example of that statement.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was different. He had known her for quite some time, and understood more about her through his best friend, Zhao Hao. Zhao Youyue was an innocent girl who was talented in everything, yet it did not keep her from remaining hardworking.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong often felt stressed in the presence of Zhao Youyue. He did not dare to have any ill intentions on her, and it was most probably because he did not deserve her. But he could feel behave normally if he treated her as a sister.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had realized about what had happened. She heard Ding Yuncong, and responded with a joke, \u201cI have seen a lot of it on the internet, everyone loves rumors! This time the headline might be \u2026 Surprise! Husband of the Nation found a new love, can\u2019t believe it\u2019s her\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong felt bad at first, fearing that he might have possibly smeared Zhao Youyue\u2019s reputation. After Zhao Youyue\u2019s joke, he burst into laughter, saying \u201cDon\u2019t say that, such a headline might just come out I used to bring my girlfriend to BBQ at night, and they would report it as if it was a surprising discovery: Ding Yuncong takes BBQ like everyone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can never recognize any of your girlfriends.\u201d Zhao Youyue could not help, but complained.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong laughed awkwardly. He knew in his heart; not many girls were like Zhao Youyue. Such beauty and elegance. Comparing her to any girl would be like comparing flowers and vases, where the vases only emphasized the beauty of that flower.</p><br/><p>\u201cActual ladies have high expectations for their men. Don\u2019t be fooled by netizens who call me the National Husband; I know that most of the time they are just being ridiculous. In fact, I really like those greedy girls. They would do anything to please me just for money, and I could enjoy their offer to the maximum\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong immediately felt wrong for saying that. How could he speak in such a manner to Zhao Youyue, it was just too candid!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was still an underaged young girl, how could he treat her like his age, it was terrible!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better this way, fulfilling the needs of the other. Your methods are not wrong, they\u2019re way better than Shi Jingnian.\u201d Zhao Youyue commented lightly. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s the difference between a realist and an idealist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong could not keep the conversation alive. Bragging about his group of celebrities in front of Zhao Youyue would definitely spoil his image.</p><br/><p>Even though he had no intentions towards Zhao Youyue, he hoped to leave a good impression on her. Zhao Youyue was the type of girl that left every man wanting to look at his best and decent in her presence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, aren\u2019t you worried about any outbursts on the internet, you might even lose a great deal of fans.\u201d Ding Yuncong thought that Zhao Youyue was being too generous. He had no idea what Zhao Youyue wanted. She seemed okay with a lot of things and nothing really perturbed her.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was Lady Zhao\u2019s character of being indecipherable that \u201cleft countless heroes bowing at her feet.\u201d Even Shi Jingnian could not figure out Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was getting bored of this image, I\u2019ve decided to cut my hair,\u201d Zhao Youyue said, as leisurely as ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Ding Yuncong did not understand what she meant. He took a look at Zhao Youyue\u2019s silky smooth long hair; and could not help but exhort \u201cThere\u2019s no need to cut it, it really matches you, why would you want to cut it, it would be such a waste!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be in twelfth grade soon; I want to cut my hair to express my determination to focus on my studies, and fight for the chance to enroll in a good university. If not, I can never find a job.\u201d Zhao Youyue spoke in a serious manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see now that you\u2019re a master of telling serious jokes with that straight face. Don\u2019t you dare presume that I\u2019m not aware of your status as a top student. Also, as a member of the Zhao family, why would you need to find a job, you would be the one hiring others!\u201d Ding Yuncong found Zhao Youyue\u2019s cold jokes particularly entertaining. He had thought that Zhao Youyue was all straight-laced and strict. She had turned out to be an interesting girl, during the trip.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong treated Zhao Youyue as one of his brothers. They were on the same channel when it came to a lot of topics.</p><br/><p>Yet, Ding Yuncong failed to comprehend why Zhao Youyue had to cut her hair. What he did not know was that Zhao Youyue was tired of being under the spotlight. She wanted to return to being an ordinary, inconspicuous stranger. Only then would she be free of all this attention.</p><br/><p>As predicted by Ding Yuncong, news spread wildly on the internet. National Husband Ding Yuncong was seen in a limited edition supercar with popular internet celebrity, Ah Yu!</p><br/><p>Some despicable media groups rushed to conclude that Zhao Youyue was Ding Yuncong\u2019s new girlfriend!</p><br/><p>Some netizens even tagged Ding Yuncong\u2019s current celebrity girlfriend \u201cA\u201d on Weibo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

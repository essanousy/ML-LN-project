She was not a professional singer. She did not have the backing of an entertainment company that could help to edit and enhance her songs. Moreover, she had not attempted to promote her songs through various means. The most she did was to mention it during her live streams.</p><br/><p>There are always lazy streamers. Some of them would even think this way: Since I have already heard all the songs during the live streams, why should I bother going through all the trouble to get on NetEase Music just to hear them again?</p><br/><p>However, compared to songs that are sung during live streams, songs that are recorded properly in a recording studio tend to give off very different feelings. The latter would be better-suited for someone to quietly listen to when they are alone. This is why a lot of people would experience all sorts of joy when they listen to Ah Yu\u2019s songs on NetEase Music!</p><br/><p>Other than the songs, Ah Yu had also uploaded a few of her violin solos on NetEase Music. The magical, unique way in which she played the violin made her listeners feel like they have entered a whole new world \u2014- \u2014- was it possible for the violin to be played this way?</p><br/><p>As we all know, many commenters on the NetEase Music platform always end up creating a lot of interesting threads. One person heard the violin solo, and went on to leave a comment saying \u201cThis person is quite good at playing the Erhu[1]\u201d. Comments like these would always spark furious debates about Chinese and Western musical instruments. However, the original commenter was obviously trolling them. It was not possible for anyone to not know what musical instrument Ah Yu had used.</p><br/><p>As for her rhythmic violin solos, someone had also left such a comment \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is directed towards those of you who always comment after hearing Ah Yu\u2019s violin solos. You talk about how your legs shake so much that they end up breaking, and say things like how you have replaced your prosthetic legs countless times. How fake can you guys get? Can your legs really break just by shaking? You guys are total shams. Well, anyway, that\u2019s that. On a side note, doctor, could you please check if you can reattach my head?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was quite an interesting comment. It embodied Zhao Youyue\u2019s rhythmic violin solos in an exaggerated manner, which showed how her violin solos were capable of evoking intense resonance within the hearts of the listeners.</p><br/><p>This time, Ah Yu is the voice actress for Yu Shengfan in the popular anime \u201cThe Strongest King.\u201d As the anime continued to air, Ah Yu\u2019s dubbing slowly got more approval from the fans. Thus, the number of people who became infected with the \u201cYu Shengfan virus\u201d also increased proportionately.</p><br/><p>The \u201cParallel Galaxies\u201d song from the anime was so good that many people from the audience expressed that they were still not bored of it yet, even though they had heard it countless times. When they heard that there were more of Ah Yu\u2019s songs, as well as violin solos on NetEase Music, they all rushed to the platform. They instantly found Ah Yu\u2019s music station, where there was a variety of covers of hit songs, as well as original songs written by her.</p><br/><p>When the fans found that the other original songs written by Ah Yu were songs that were originally written by Chu Luoxun in \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d they were shocked. Did Ah Yu not only roleplay Yu Shengfan, but also Chu Luoxun?</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone suddenly remembered that Ah Yu could really play the violin like a Goddess. Her violin songs would draw in the general public like a lighthouse in a dark storm. As they listen to it, their souls would slowly slip into the magical world of music.</p><br/><p>It was too bad that many people never got to see Zhao Youyue perform \u2018live\u2019 before. This is because the \u201cspiritual music\u201d contained in the \u201cChu Luoxun card\u201d would only be triggered when the music is heard during is a live performance. Regardless of whether the music is played during a live stream, or recorded in a recording studio, a layer would impede the transfer, so listeners would not get its full effects.</p><br/><p>Even so, Ah Yu\u2019s talent in music managed to surprise all those who heard her music. They even felt sorry for Ah Yu. It was such a waste. A talented musician like her did not have a company to support her properly. She seemed far too indifferent towards fame and fortune. All of her beautiful songs would just be sung without filters while in live streams. Furthermore, they were uploaded freely on the internet, without any form of monetization. She was not even bothered to release an album!</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue recorded the songs of \u201cSweet\u201d and \u201cI Left the Sadness to Myself,\u201d she had also went on to record \u201cAngel Wings\u201d and \u201cJust Happened to Meet You.\u201d Naturally, the beauty of her music left even more fans trailing after her. The \u2018aesthetic researchers\u2019 of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d had also gone wild!</p><br/><p>The mere fact that such a talented musician like Ah Yu was also a reader of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d made them feel very blessed. Although Ah Yu did not declare whether she was a Lin Meiyue fan or a Chu Luoxun fan, it was clear that she has already recreated all of Chu Luoxun\u2019s songs from the novel and brought them into the real world. This definitely showed that she is a hardcore Chu Luoxun fan, right?</p><br/><p>On NetEase Music, all of the songs from the novel that have been brought to the real world were now exceptionally popular. This is mainly because they were already brilliant, to begin with!</p><br/><p>Various creative commenters had commented on these songs. For example, under \u201cParallel Galaxies,\u201d this comment had gotten the highest number of likes, because it managed to express what everyone else thought \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cYour heart is filled with snow, while the sun is glaring in the South, whereas I only know of Spring even during the cold nights in the North.\u201d This song deeply illustrated how people tended to have self-contradicting thoughts, because there are heaters in the North, but not in the South.</p><br/><p>Similarly, under \u201cSweet\u201d and \u201cI Left the Sadness to Myself,\u201d various types of comments that contained stories about first love, feelings and the like have appeared, one after another. Some people had even praised Ah Yu for being able to write both songs so flawlessly, even though a vast contrast in emotions juxtapositioned them. One was extremely soft and sweet, whereas the other was extremely gloomy and despairing. This is indeed real talent!</p><br/><p>However, when there are too many comments, it tends to prompt the use of reverse psychology. For example, someone commented: \u201cI just came here to hear some songs. I have no stories, no girlfriend. I did not take the national examination, and I also have no family or friends that are dead. I am not specifically here for the feels, for the dreams, for a relationship, or for my livelihood. I am simply here to listen to some songs [pout] [pout] [pout].\u201d</p><br/><p>As for \u201cAngel Wings,\u201d the song had certainly aroused the sympathy of many people. There was a comment that said \u201cI typed a whole bunch of words, but I deleted it\u201d which had close to 9000 likes. Evidently, it was a song that makes people hold back their words.</p><br/><p>Lastly, the finale song of \u201cJust Happened to Meet You\u201d undoubtedly became the hottest one out of all the songs. This was also a song in \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d which Chu Luoxun had dedicated to the male protagonist after her death. Through this song, the \u2018aesthetic researchers\u2019 have identified that Chu Luoxun\u2019s feelings for the male protagonist were not inferior to that of Lin Meiyue\u2019s!</p><br/><p>Just when everyone was sure that such a song could only be fantasized about, it had been recreated in the real world by a talented person. Furthermore, it had been recreated so beautifully. There was another comment that went like this: \u201cThe chorus is poisonous\u2026 I played the song three times today. The first time I heard it, I was like what the hell is this song\u2026 the second time I heard it, I thought it was pretty good\u2026 on the third time I got poisoned, and now the song is on endless repeat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The number of likes on this comment had almost reached 90,000!</p><br/><p>The songs that initially appeared in the novel have actually become hit songs in reality!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Han Leng, the creator of \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d had finally noticed this legendary \u201cAh Yu.\u201d When he heard that the songs which appeared in his own novel had been sung with completed lyrics, he was thoroughly shocked!</p><br/><p>Everyone says that \u201cAh Yu\u201d is the 3D Yu Shengfan, but he felt that this \u201cAh Yu\u201d is the 3D Chu Luoxun instead!</p><br/><p>No one will believe him if he says it out. He had actually heard all of these songs, word for word, note for note, when he was \u201cintoxicated\u201d! Isn\u2019t this just too mysterious?</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cErhu\u201d is a two-stringed bowed musical instrument, more specifically a spike fiddle, which may also be called a Southern Fiddle, and sometimes known in the Western world as the Chinese violin or a Chinese two-stringed fiddle. It is used as a solo instrument as well as in small ensembles and large orchestras. It is the most popular of the huqin family of traditional bowed string instruments used by various ethnic groups of China.

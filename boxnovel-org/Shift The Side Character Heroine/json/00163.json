Gu Yuan was wide awake, lying on his bed, recalling everything that he had been through for the day.</p><br/><p>After he saw Lin Meiyue\u2019s mail, he bolted upright. He hesitated for a moment because he still had that trauma towards music competitions, but eventually agreed to go with her.</p><br/><p>Of course, they were not going there alone; they had invited Chen Hao and Wang Yan as well.</p><br/><p>They were too embarrassed to on a date alone\u2026</p><br/><p>After they decided to go watch the music competition together, they started to talk about music, and it went smoothly unlike previously, when their conversation was extremely awkward. Both of them vaguely felt their feelings for each other.</p><br/><p>The most wonderful feeling in the world was to find out your crush likes you too, it was just indescribable.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, most crushes are one-sided.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurly hair!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your nickname.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a weird nickname. lol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because your hair is messy, as if you just woke up from your sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful April\u201d was a modern romance novel, and the conversations between the main hero and heroine via Wechat became more frequent. Even though they were too shy to talk to each other in reality, both of them had no problem holding a conversation in Wechat, after finding a topic on even ground to dwell in.</p><br/><p>For the \u201cChat history\u201d to be more heart-warming, and full of lovey-dovey scent, Han Leng had done his homework, so his readers would smile while reading those text messages, even he could not resist the urge to fall in love again.</p><br/><p>When \u201cBeautiful April\u201d gives rise to such sentiments, it was destined to be successful.</p><br/><p>Success is still not enough to make a literary work famous; it would need something outstanding. That \u201csomething,\u201d was undoubtedly \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four of them went to watch \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d national music competition the next day. When Gu Yuan arrived at the venue, he was already surrounded by the crowd\u2026</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan was once a famous pianist because he was amazingly talented, but now he was just a failed music genius, his plight was awfully similar to the main protagonist in \u201cFight Break Sphere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan\u2019s expression turned dark, but he tried to put up his best appearance, because Lin Meiyue was right beside him, perhaps this was the power of first love.</p><br/><p>It has been a while ever since Gu Yuan showed up in a theater, his musical senses were still intact, he could even become a judge. This music competition was about skill and accuracy; those excessive personal feelings were unneeded, Gu Yuan\u2019s mother was always scolding him for putting in unnecessary feelings into his instruments.</p><br/><p>What that made Gu Yuan curious was that, this violin competition was accompanied by a piano performance.</p><br/><p>This was actually a subtle hint for Gu Yuan to become \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d partner in the future.</p><br/><p>The contestants before \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d were nothing special; they were just about average, nothing was special in their music, which sunk the audience into a stupor, until \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d appeared on stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d style was completely different!</p><br/><p>Concurrently, Han Leng had also entered his \u201cintoxicated state\u201d when he reached this point!</p><br/><p>He wrote, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d stepped up in a silky white gown, and her face alone drove the entire theater to utter, bewitched silence!</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d did not come here to win the competition, she just wanted to bring more joy to the people, while expressing her genuine feelings to everyone.</p><br/><p>She felt a little nervous before the play, so she chanted her magical words in her head, \u201cDieu de la musique, s\u2019il vous plat coutez mon appel,\u201d and after saying those magic words, she instantly found her flow\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d performance was marvelous, the audiences stood up and gave her a round of applause. But her actions had earned the fury of one of the judges, as it was no longer that specific song, it had been heavily improvised. He admitted it was indeed better than the original, but this was a competition, not a performance!</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d could not care less; she was happy about it, because she had came here to perform at her own will, she does not need any approval or praises from the officials.</p><br/><p>The plot of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d went to a halt at that point.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in reality.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue stirred from her sleep. Even though her body had enough rest, but upon entering the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d she would still be awake in her dreams, and it mentally drained her. Everyone knows the difference between dreaming the whole night and sleeping through the whole night without having any dreams at all.</p><br/><p>This is why Zhao Youyue would not enter the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d every day, and even if she does enter, she would only go in for a few hours, in order to have enough time to rest and stay healthy.</p><br/><p>Possessing \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d was certainly enjoyable, but she was getting ahead of herself this time.</p><br/><p>She was indeed in a good mood, being able to possess a goddess character like \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d was an amazing experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was very popular in the novel, even the children who did not know her beforehand would buy her flowers after hearing her spectacular performance.</p><br/><p>Indeed, not many readers would like a character like \u201cLong Aotian,\u201d or \u201cMary Sue.\u201d That was because the author never actually put in any effort into the character development, but who does not want to be \u201cLong Aotian\u201d or \u201cMary Sue\u201d in reality?</p><br/><p>That was just a fantasy that everyone wished they had.</p><br/><p>When \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d used her music to capture the hearts of every single audience, Zhao Youyue was looking forward to the day where she could do the same in reality!</p><br/><p>When it comes to games and music, she definitely preferred the latter.</p><br/><p>Her live-streaming in Douyu had not yet really picked up. It certainly was not easy to become successful in a short amount of time; it was not as easy as in the novel.</p><br/><p>First of all, it could not be helped, because Zhao Youyue never reveals her face, which resulted in a great loss of her appeal as a female gamer.</p><br/><p>Second, to become the first rank in the nation was definitely not going to be an easy task. Also, Zhao Youyue did not spend too much time playing games; it would be quite impossible for her to live stream her game every single night. There was no way that she would reach the top in such a short time.</p><br/><p>Thirdly, Douyu was one of the largest live streaming platforms in the nation, without any sponsor or a signed contract with Douyu, there was little to no hope for fresh blood to become famous overnight.</p><br/><p>Fourth, upon activating \u201cYu Shengfan card,\u201d Zhao Youyue would become irascible. A rich lady like \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d would never bother about the gifts thrown in by the fans. A tycoon would want the live streamer to be respectful and thankful for their gifts, but \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d showed no signs of being thankful at all. Naturally, nobody would want to promote her\u2026</p><br/><p>But Zhao Youyue had faith in \u201cYu Shengfan,\u201d she firmly believed these setbacks were all temporary.</p><br/><p>At this moment, what that concerned her the most was the latest issue of \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

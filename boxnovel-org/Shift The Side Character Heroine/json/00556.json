Genius Han actually took it upon himself to contact me? I am so terrified! My idol has reached out this humble fan?\u201d Zhao Youyue said it mockingly, even though her tone could have convinced any learned onlooker. It was the material of Oscars.</p><br/><p>Some guys actually fancied such girls, as they found such personalities cute, even if it was weird to others.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was as clueless as a clueless chick magnet could ever be. He behaved just like how he did when he visited cafes with Zhao Youyue during their high school years. He only knew how to talk about literature, without touching on any of his inner thoughts. Such an act was so well done that even the perceptive Zhao Youyue was utterly convinced that he had no interest in her.</p><br/><p>Looking at it from another perspective, Han Leng was quite an actor himself. If he were to expose his inner thoughts, would he still be able to remain friends with Lady Zhao?</p><br/><p>Those who maintained their supposed friendships after confessing to each other were lying to themselves. The awkwardness would snuff out the relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilady! Now is not the time to joke about! Your reputation would go up in smoke if you don\u2019t do anything about it!\u201d Han Leng said in hushed worry.</p><br/><p>It was mid-day, and the two of them met in a library. Han Leng had dressed in such an odd fashion that concealed his face; as if he was afraid that someone would find out that he had been able to ask the \u201cMilitary War Goddess,\u201d the \u201cFlower of the School\u201d Zhao Youyue out.</p><br/><p>Ever since he became famous, he always met with Zhao Youyue in all sorts of disguises. It annoyed Zhao Youyue, but it also drew her merciless teasing.</p><br/><p>Han Leng had maintained that it was simply the burden of being a celebrity. It may seem that he treated his female fans harshly, but it was a tactic that made use of the fetishes of others.</p><br/><p>He could not mislead others into thinking that he was no longer without a girlfriend \u2013 it would shatter the image that he had worked so hard to build. His current character was doing its job well. Who cared if his writing was haphazard, they would still buy it.</p><br/><p>Han Leng had even exaggerated about having many female fans, and how some of them were beautiful and talented. As long as he remained single, he would be able to hit on his female fans. Such was the dream life of a writer.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was genuinely neutral about that and remained calm. However, for an instant, she felt that the old Han Leng was cuter.</p><br/><p>Han Leng\u2019s words and actions earned Zhao Youyue\u2019s full trust. He was the only person not fooled by that endless string of lies \u2013 he did not want to trouble her.</p><br/><p>He felt that he had become that \u201cfriend A.\u201d The only difference being that friend A in novels was the main character, and he was not.</p><br/><p>Creators functioned like so. Painfully aware that they were not the main characters, they would reimagine a new world that altered the reality of that fact.</p><br/><p>Reality was always cruel, fantasy was warm and welcoming.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue heard what Han Leng said, and smiled while replying \u201cMy reputation does not mean anything. I did not count on my reputation to earn my spot here anyway. How about you hurry up before your reputation runs out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng was slightly shocked. Although Milady\u2019s face had that same old smile, he somehow felt a tinge of resentment from her speech.</p><br/><p>No\u2026 This must have been a mistake. Milady has always been a proud and lonely girl; he could not allow himself to be deceived.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Milady has yet to learn about those nasty rumors? Although I do not live in-campus, I heard that these rumors have already reached the boys\u2019 dorm. This is no joke \u2013 guys are more capable of gossiping than you can imagine. The wildfires of that rumor is already raging out of control, yet here you sit without a care. If you let this situation persist, that rumor will soon be everybody\u2019s truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng was a man of few words, but he now rambled on and on about the situation. He had seen enough and was no longer able to watch Zhao Youyue being slandered any longer, yet he also knew that Zhao Youyue enjoyed taking the wheel in her own hands. The classic Zhao Youyue method was to act like the prey and gobble down those who dared take the bait, but if she took a moment longer to act, she might end up being the actual prey.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t anyone spread rumors about me back in high school?\u201d Zhao Youyue remained calm and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was unable to answer. In actuality, what that perplexed him the most was the fact that not a single person had yet to uncover her true identity, considering how easily it could be found on the internet.</p><br/><p>The name Zhao Youyue seemed to be the codewords that activated an invisible cloaking device. On the other hand, Ah Yu triggered a truth bomb of nuclear proportions.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps those high schoolers were simple and thoroughly indoctrinated by the sorry excuse they call, \u201ceducation.\u201d Milady, your beauty only grows with time \u2013 you can no longer stay low as before, and beautiful girls always attract rumors. Jiang Qing was a prior victim of this, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Han Leng praised Zhao Youyue without even realizing it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c(sneer) It seems like the Genius Han is actually well versed in praising others, huh. Not bad, not bad, there is finally some improvement. Don\u2019t fret about the rumors, you were there from the beginning, just sit back and watch. You can just go ahead and hit on chicks. There is no need to worry, the truth will always be the truth, and lies will only expose themselves in the end.\u201d Zhao Youyue\u2019s smile became much brighter.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was like a knight who would rush into the enemies\u2019 den, armed with just a sword and a shield. He sought to rid the world of the rumor, but his methods were crude and simple. Zhao Youyue only needed to reveal her true identity and quell the storm, so what was with the wait?</p><br/><p>Did she intend to reveal the truth when the rumor was at its peak? Was that actually her idea of providing the most shock?</p><br/><p>Wait up\u2026 was Zhao Youyue actually using this rumor to spread her name?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right! I decided to create a club, and you are to be my vice-president! You are not in any clubs yet, aren\u2019t you? Well, if you are, be a dear and write them a nice note expressing your withdrawal. There shouldn\u2019t be any problems, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng felt as if he had just passed some kind of interview, having just earned Lady Zhao\u2019s approval\u2026 But he also sense a trap looming somewhere beyond his sight \u2013 it was best to distance himself before falling for the trap.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe literature club had already sent me an invitation though, and you know how deeply in love am I with literature. There are so many who adore and look up to me in the club\u2026 How could I possibly decline?\u201d Han Leng said, showing how keen he was to distance himself from Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>In reality, he was extremely curious to know more about this club, and its purpose. Anything created by Lady Zhao could not possibly be ordinary.</p></div>\n</div>"}

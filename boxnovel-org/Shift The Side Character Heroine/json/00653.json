None of these main quests coincide with each other.</p><br/><p>Still, one would surely need their base, and that base had to be firm and unbreachable. For Olivia, that base would be the Kaer Morhen.</p><br/><p>Olivia\u2019s goals involved global domination. Cirilla\u2019s was much simpler \u2013 be a mighty witcher, protect her sister.</p><br/><p>Geralt and Vesemir highly admired Cirilla\u2019s thirst for power. They may not allow Cirilla to go through the Trials of Grass, not just yet. They compromised by putting her through the sort of training Witchers underwent.</p><br/><p>They were shocked to see her completing whatever form of training they could throw at her without a hitch. Her talent for the sword was admirable.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Elder Blood in her veins made it so that she did not require the Trials of Grass, but still have access to supernatural strength, agility, and honed senses that others her age would never achieve.</p><br/><p>Only the Elder Blood was capable of this. The Trial of Grasses was plainly something meant only for those who did not have the blood to achieve such mutation, adding to the fact that the mortality rate was ridiculously high.</p><br/><p>Olivia did not waste her time with the sword or her tumbling parkour abilities. Speaking of which, Geralt and Cirilla even challenged each other in a parkour competition. That was how Cirilla got to see Geralt as her father.</p><br/><p>During her time at Kaer Morhen, Cirilla\u2019s heart started mending itself. Not only was her sister there with her, she even got to feel the love of a true father from Geralt and Vesemir.</p><br/><p>And thus, Cirilla had started to treat the place as her home.</p><br/><p>Olivia already had the \u201cnameless maiden Su Shi\u201d\u2018s sword skills and parkour ability. There was no need to waste her time to join them in training. She would rather learn magic if she could.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, at Kaer Morhen, there were quite a few books regarding magic. Who had asked their \u201cfather\u201d to be such a witch-slayer? Some of them had such special treatment from him that Kaer Morhen had reserved some rooms specifically for them.</p><br/><p>Although they used the words \u201ctrue love,\u201d there was no way they could withstand the cold and broken down Kaer Morhen.</p><br/><p>These two witches were Yenefer and Triss. The two of them were close friends, but by pure chance, they both had fallen for Geralt, creating a love triangle.</p><br/><p>Geralt had already seen a fair bit of Olivia\u2019s magic, and could tell that she really liked magic. And so, Geralt got Triss to teach the little princess some magic.</p><br/><p>Cirilla had also revealed her magic capabilities during her sword training, but she had been unable to control it unlike her sister Olivia. Such bursts of uncontrolled magic worried Geralt and Vesemir, who were both unfamiliar with magic. Vesemir had even suggested letting Cirilla take the Trial of Grasses. It was very risky, but if successful, she would become a full-fledged witcher, allowing them to assign her to actual training.</p><br/><p>They were witchers, not witches.</p><br/><p>Olivia had blatantly refused. She said that her sister was born a Source, whose talent was acknowledged, even by Vilgefortz. Accepting the Trial of Grasses would be a waste of her talents.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026 Did you just say that your teacher was Vilgefortz?\u201d Geralt had spluttered.</p><br/><p>Geralt recalled of one of his earliest encounters with Olivia. She had slain Foglets like a seasoned veteran. Her skill and magic had been something to behold.</p><br/><p>Now that Olivia had gained her freedom at Kaer Morhen, she may have finally be able to learn for herself, with no need for someone to tutor her.</p><br/><p>Now knowing who her teacher is, Geralt could finally put two and two together.</p><br/><p>Vilgefortz had caused a fuss in the north \u2013 even earning him worldwide renown. In the blink of an eye, he had become Nilfgaard\u2019s official counselor.</p><br/><p>Back during the Battle of Sodden Hill, with his power alone, Vilgefortz had faced 22 fellow sorcerers, walking away as the victor, sending shock across the land.</p><br/><p>A total of 100,000 had joined the battle, and at least 30,000 were killed or severely wounded during the battle. The 22 sorcerers had worked with the Northern Continent\u2019s army to attack Nilfgaard.</p><br/><p>Vilgefortz of the Roggeveen had met the sorcerors, introducing them to their demise.</p><br/><p>Victory was claimed, Cintra fell, and Nilfgaard grew.</p><br/><p>Among the 22 sorcerers, had 14 fallen in the battle. Triss Merigold was mistakenly included among them, and her name was carved on the memorial as the 14th martyr.</p><br/><p>In reality, she was just badly burnt during the battle, but she did not die. With the help of magic, she hid the burns from most with illusory magic. She had even restored her sight that was lost during the battle. However, mental traumas could never be healed with magic.</p><br/><p>Both sides lost many, which led to a peace treaty. Thus ended the 1st Nilfgaard-Nordling War.</p><br/><p>Due to that, Sodden Hill was known as the Hill of Sorcerers or the Hill of the 14 Martyrs. An obelisk was erected on the peak of the hill, with the names of the 14 fallen sorcerers. During the 30th of April, which was May Day, the nearby villagers would light up the torches in memory of the 14 heroes.</p><br/><p>That was why be it Yennefer, Triss or Vilgefortz, he may treat them as equal, but deep inside, he had always respected them.</p><br/><p>He had gotten Triss to teach Olivia, who was Vilgefortz\u2019s disciple. Wasn\u2019t that awkward?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

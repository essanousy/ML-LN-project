Most probably that was the time where most readers came online, if they were satisfied with the update, they would probably tip the author; if they were unhappy or not satisfied, they would throw complaints at the author.</p><br/><p>The newest chapter of the novel already had more than hundreds of negative comments, \u201cawkward\u201d, \u201cvenomous\u201d, \u201cvomit blood\u201d, \u201cunbearable to watch\u201d\u2026 The appearance of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d surely made an impact\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the heck is this \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019? Is she the heroine? I\u2019m gonna abandon this book if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s killing me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs like reading an ancient description of a decorative character towards a rich lady, I hope Rosemary can just give up on adding female character. I think I will adopt cancer upon reading it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram! Yu Shengfan, or else I\u2019m gonna abandon this book!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessional Esports player doesn\u2019t need a girlfriend, sincerely hope that Lin Feng was a lone wolf!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs an old fan of Rosemary, this gives me deja vu, just give up on writing female character already!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing that everyone have the same reaction, I rest assured. Rosemary is indeed good at writing plots and gaming experience, but the female characters are really poisonous\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After reading those heated comments in the comment section, Zhao Youyue held her forehead again and hoped Rosemary could withstand these unforgiving comments. She would \u201crescue\u201d Yu Shengfan tonight when she entered the world of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Rosemary\u2019s wife, Li Mengyao also joined the bandwagon of complaining at her husband with this latest update of his novel, she was his fan as well, she loved to read her husband\u2019s novel.</p><br/><p>Li Mengyao usually read the novels via her tablet, an eBook so to speak. But today, upon reading the newfound character of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d in her husband\u2019s book, she said, \u201cWhy did you add a female character out of the blue? Can\u2019t you just admit that you can\u2019t describe a female character\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually this is not my fault, there\u2019s a tycoon reader that requested a cameo. Look, she even tipped me 2,000 RMB for this book alone, the first Sect Master.\u201d Ye Hai said it awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Li Mengyao looked through the fans ranking, the first Sect Master was indeed a fan named \u201cYouyue\u201d. She not only tipped the book, she even registered a full subscription for it. \u201cDo you seriously think that you had successfully got on her good side? I don\u2019t think she will ever reward you again after you\u2019ve ruined her cameo!\u201d She mocked her husband.</p><br/><p>She could not help but to get reminded of the past when her husband created a female character model after her, even though it was not exaggerated like \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, it was enough to make her feel like kicking her husband in the face.</p><br/><p>It was absolutely humiliating, that idiotic, innocent sweet, saint-like character did not exist in the real world! She knew that her husband wanted to portrait a girl\u2019s gentleness and kindness, but the vibe of the heroine gave readers the creep, it felt like something fake, it was best not to be seen.</p><br/><p>Li Mengyao had always stopped her husband from writing more romantic scenes or interactions between male protagonists and heroines, she even had to threaten him with death threats in order to stop Ye Hai from writing those.</p><br/><p>Well, that was a bit too far-fetched\u2026</p><br/><p>Anyways, what made Li Mengyao helpless was, even though her husband was bad at it, he would still always show it to her about how he wrote as if he never noticed it himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoney, come and take a look at your portrait that I wrote, do you think the readers will like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Like? How can I even like it?</p><br/><p>You should be grateful that people don\u2019t hate it! Keep dreaming!</p><br/><p>Wake up! My great author Ye!</p><br/><p>Finally, under her strong intervention, the female character model after her, had disappeared from the book. She could then enjoy the novel without worries.</p><br/><p>Li Mengyao was satisfied with her husband latest work \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d because there was no female characters in it. The plots were intense, characters full of emotions. \u201cEternal War\u201d had its own originality, allowing Ye Hai to add in more elements, to make it more interesting and attractive.</p><br/><p>Li Mengyao was looking forward to see the epilogue of the competition between the main protagonist\u2019s team against \u201cDemon King\u201d team head to head, but he had added in a female character to ruined her mood!</p><br/><p>Looking at her husband awkward expression, \u201cGotcha, am I right?\u201d She smiled.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai took out his phone, opened up his chat history with Zhao Youyue and showed to his wife, \u201cMy tycoon fan had a very good temper, much better than yours last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Li Mengyao read through the log, she sighed and said, \u201cThis Lady Youyue was certainly rich, she just tipped you 100,000 Qidian coins without saying anything, and yet you ruin her cameo just like that, is this how you treat your Sect Master? What do you mean by much better than me last time, she doesn\u2019t know that you model this \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 after her. Furthermore, I am your wife, of course I can complain straight to your face! She even gave you suggestions after you added her as QQ friends, probably she can\u2019t take it anymore as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hai smiled awkwardly, and looked at the heated comment section, and asked, \u201cWhat should I do? Shall I make her disappear? Do you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he said it that way, but he had already decided to try the method \u201cYouyue\u201d suggested, considered it as his final struggle. If that still could not satisfy the readers, he would never ever add female characters into his novels again.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it a shot! As your wife, I will always support your decision. Even though I can accompany you with games, doing house chores and taking care our kid, but I can\u2019t write any books. I feel that her suggestion might actually work, this may be your stepping stone to greater success!\u201d Li Mengyao smiled at her husband, she already knew her husband determination, all she could do was to support him.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai let out a sigh of relief and held his wife\u2019s hands, feeling grateful to her.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue fell asleep, she once again entered the Two Dimensional Gate tonight.</p>\n</div>"}

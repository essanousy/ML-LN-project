She had not even lifted it up after months. So that\u2019s how it felt like to live as a caveman. She had been kept out of the loop, especially of the things that concerned her the most</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, or Xu Jing, had really given her all in this college entrance exam. For an entire month before the exam, she had been completely fixated on that one goal!</p><br/><p>This was the reason behind Zhao Youyue\u2019s unyielding confidence!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had never once expected to be the center of the internet\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>When she saw that there were many fans on the internet worrying about her, sympathizing her, she could only blink in silence. Were they mourning for her death or something? Where did all these fans even come from? Some had even held vigils in her name, saying that no matter what, Zhao Youyue had to perform for her college entrance exam, even if they had to pay with three years of their lifespans\u2026</p><br/><p>What in the world was going on? She had been extremely low-key, especially as of late. Her passerby powers were at maximum output. Why is she in the spotlight again?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue started to get to the bottom of things. She kept tracing back until she came across the point where Han Leng wielded her name as a weapon to end Huang Zongchao.</p><br/><p>Huang Zongchao had not participated in the college entrance exams, to the extent that someone had kept using this matter to criticize him. He was considered to be a deserter, a coward. He was only entering the Capital University through a shortcut. He did not deserve the spot!</p><br/><p>As someone who once shared classrooms with Huang Zongchao, Zhao Youyue knew that he had what it took for the Capital University. Coming up at the top was another question. There were very few Huang Zongchaos in the world, but some students might have been born ready for this exam, and would perform extraordinarily for this once.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was certain that she had that extraordinary level!</p><br/><p>Unhesitatingly, she logged into her dusty Weibo account and posted \u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, everyone, for being so concerned over my college entrance exams. Please do not worry. I\u2019ve performed very well during my exam. I can feel it in my bones!\u201d</p><br/><p>The response was as frustrating and as misconstrued as ever. Many fans had their doubts about it. Lady Zhao Youyue was probably just pretending</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Ah Yu, it\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to put up a strong front. If you didn\u2019t perform well in your exam, just have a good cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerformed well? This is one of the top three last words ever to be said in life. When I had my exams during my seventh grade, I had a nice feeling as well. I even considered the infamous, notorious Mathematics easy. At the end, it was a bloodbath. Absolute massacre! I\u2019m still picking up the pieces today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Lady, I refuse to believe that you could remain so calm. No human would remain this calm after all that has happened. Let\u2019s throw the pan to Su Li instead. It\u2019s all her fault. As for Zi Mu, according to latest news, she seems to have some serious issues and is on the search for professional help. Su, the Great Deity, is truly great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yu, do you have any complete Leng Zi love letters? I think that Great Scholar Han\u2019s love letters were quite well-written. Why don\u2019t you take them out and share it with the world\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Ah Yu, have you joined the Optimistic Family as well? The result\u2019s are even out yet. Be careful not to jinx yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yu, I just want to know, what\u2019s your relationship with Master Han? Has he been pursuing you at school very diligently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue saw the latest replies on her Weibo and resignedly shook her head. She had not been anywhere close to the storm when it happened. Even if she was, what about it?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was a very optimistic person. She had the capabilities to back it up. She was not afraid of trouble at all. Her fans were the biggest drama queens ever</p><br/><p>In their eyes, she probably looked far too vulnerable, far too fragile, far too defenseless. She was too gentle and dignified. Hurting her would be easy.</p><br/><p>Oh dear, how could anyone be any more wrong? If you consider her easy pickings, then everyone else in this world would be free gifts in a handbasket. Zhao Youyue was a lady of action, a master schemer. She kept her friends close to her heart, her enemies far closer.</p><br/><p>This proactivity probably stemmed from her bone marrows. She wanted everything to be under her servitude. They would be at her beck and call.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue saw the fans mentioning Han Leng\u2019s love letters, she did not exactly get to the bottom of things. She hopped over to Han Leng\u2019s Weibo and looked around. Apparently, he had wholeheartedly claimed to be just a ghostwriter of the love letters, and wholeheartedly claimed that he had no hearts hovering above his head when it came to Zhao Youyue. Zhao Youyue curled her lips into a hollow smile. This was nothing, if not slightly disappointing.</p><br/><p>In terms of how a girl felt, Zhao Youyue was not all that different. She could dislike a guy. But if a guy always could not wait to break the relationship with her, stating clearly that he had no interest in her, it would take a little chunk from her heart. Was her charm that little?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue and Han Leng could be considered old schoolmates. They had been in the same school since junior high. She only became dissociated from her passerby state when they entered high school. That one book had gotten them closer together.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, at that moment, be it words, or action, Han Leng looked like he would never fall in love with her at all. Even after countless love letters for her, he still insisted on claiming himself to be just a ghostwriter!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s EQ was supposed to be higher than her IQ. Yet, she found Han Leng enchanting, in various ways. Perhaps it was his feelings for her coming through, without him ever expressing them, and they had given her mixed signals. He never once took the initiative to send Zhao Youyue messages on his own. Whenever he was with Zhao Youyue, he always spoke about literature very seriously. He wrote for her, professionally. He had so many chances to stay alone with her, yet he had been like a meditative monk, being extremely stern and rigid</p><br/><p>This was Han Leng. His character had brought him to the one he truly loved, but it also prevented him from actually reaching her.</p><br/><p>Even if he had not fallen for Zhao Youyue, but another girl, it would have probably ended the same. The more he fell for her, the more he would resist, and the more he would be lost in his world of perpetual self-denial. When the girl finally gets taken by another guy, his heart would shatter into tiny little pieces, each of them blossoming into bottomless wells of inspiration. He would produce a masterpiece, commemorating everything!</p><br/><p>His whole life belonged to literature, not any particular girl.</p><br/><p>As a writer with ideals and odd pursuits, women were just materials of his works. Love was only a tool to stimulate his inspiration. Producing an iconic masterpiece was the only pursuit and purpose of his life.</p><br/><p>Time flew. Ten days later, on the 22nd of June, the college entrance exam results were released.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

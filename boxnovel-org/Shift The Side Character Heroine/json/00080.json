The setting of \u201cKing of Superpowers\u201d was messy, full of plot holes, and it was not very popular either.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue mustered her patience and give this book a read, mainly to get to know about its setting. She found out that the main protagonist powers were not consistent, he could always unleash unbelievable powers in a pinch.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, a book that has non-serious settings would definitely make the realm felt fake. It would make dreaming felt like less dreamy with more realistic feel.</p><br/><p>Those creations that made people thought they were dreaming was most probably those conscious-minded novels. A place where time, space and logic were not affected. Due to the changing of venues, jumping between spaces, it usually would not be affected by time. Yet time was constantly changing in the form of past, present, or intervene with each other. These realms of conscious-minded creation had something that could be described with words.</p><br/><p>In the second realm aka \u201cPure Romance\u201d, Zhao Youyue could obviously tell that there was a huge difference. It definitely felt more realistic than the first realm, because of the plots were not conflicted with each other, it did not make the world felt illusionary.</p><br/><p>Due to \u201cPure Romance\u201d setting, most of the action had taken place at school. As \u201cPure Romance\u201d got more popularity, Zhao Youyue realized that the realm would become more realistic, and she would have more freedom to roam around, even take over the plots.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue had caused a scene in \u201cPure Romance\u201d, it helped her to understand better of her influence towards the author. The author was not in control of the story progression, they might be able to control at the beginning of the story. As its popularity rise, more readers would suggest ideas to the author. And of course, the author had already affected in their subconsciousness.</p><br/><p>During that time, with the influence of readers, Zhao Youyue would be able to cause more scene, even the mangaka would become her puppet. This was a price to pay for more popularity, a price for Zhao Youyue to possess one of his character creations.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue entered the realm of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, she strongly felt that this realm was even more realistic. Obviously it was because of Rosemary\u2019s standard, his settings in the novel were carefully designed. Of course the popularity of this novel had a direct impact on the level of relativity in this realm.</p><br/><p>In the novel \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, besides that the original game \u201cEternal War\u201d, the other elements were taken from the real world. Besides from \u201cLoL\u201d, some inspirations were taken from \u201cDoTA2\u201d as well. Real life competition from all over the world inspired the battle scenes in the book.</p><br/><p>All these settings were familiar to the readers, and realistic too. They were looking forward to see the main protagonist Lin Feng, leading his team to return to the tournament, fighting off his opponents.</p><br/><p>Of course Zhao Youyue thought that the more realistic the better, she could not bear to see those awkward interactions in \u201cPure Romance\u201d, it burned her eyes badly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had successfully \u201cpossess\u201d Yu Shengfan, she finally could set up her desired characteristics and abilities, with her background almost done by Rosemary. \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was not considered as a cameo, she was more like a side character instead. If Zhao Youyue did not suggest Rosemary to use another method to describe \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, she probably would have disappeared in the next chapter update.</p><br/><p>A real cameo would be like \u201cXu Jing\u201d, she did not even have a proper background or appearance in the story. Unlike \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, in order for Rosemary to coax Zhao Youyue, he made her appearance official. A character with a strong sense of presence, too bad with her blinding character description, she got bashed by the readers upon her debut.</p><br/><p>Cameo like \u201cXu Jing\u201d, when the mangaka wanted to add in her background setting, Zhao Youyue would be given another chance to set up her characteristics. But she had only one chance of setting up \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, she must consider it thoroughly.</p><br/><p>The benefits of setting up a side character, as long as Zhao Youyue did not set her abilities and characteristics too far-fetched, the author would not censor it out because it was too weird.</p><br/><p>She suggested \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d as an esper yet, even though esper Misaka Mikoto was good in gaming as well. If \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d really had this kind of ridiculous powers, the readers would abandon this book immediately! Who would have read a book about Esports and had espers in it? What was the point of reading it?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not constricted like last time, as she only gave \u201cXu Jing\u201d the ability to learn passionately. The first ability she set up for \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d would be\u2026</p><br/><p>Proficient in multiple languages!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of languages\u201d, Yu Shengfan!</p>\n</div>"}

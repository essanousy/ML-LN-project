All she wanted to do was to wreck something to her heart\u2019s content!</p><br/><p>This was due to the fact that she no longer cared about the consequences. She did not care if the screenwriter writes off her crazy character setting, who was out of this world. For once, she just wanted to become the main protagonist of a story!</p><br/><p>She did not come with the intention of creating an iconic character. She came with the sole purpose of becoming a superhuman in this boring drama!</p><br/><p>At the same time, she wanted to stand up for Liu Xing, because that Liang Feifan was way too horrible. You will always look forward for the day these characters get their dues. She did not have to be like Liu Xing who was constantly looking at the big picture. In this world of drama, she alone could accomplish the feat of defeating the Russians!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the drama world, Liu Xing had a mixed feeling of sorrow and anger. This five-year-old girl Tan Xiaoya was just too pitiful. Not only was her family tortured and killed by the Russians, even she caught by stray bullets and would soon join her family, never able to see justice being served</p><br/><p>This side character Tan Xiaoya represented the suffering and loss of millions of Chinese people due to the invasion. Her death was a testament to the ruthlessness of the Russian invaders!</p><br/><p>However, not long after Liu Xing was having the mixed feeling of grief and anger, \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d suddenly recovered from her near-death state, as though as she had been reborn in flames. She had these mysterious lights glowing around her. Then, a huge sword appeared in her hand that came from nowhere, and it was even taller than herself. She lifted the sword and rested it on her shoulder, before putting on a roguish grin\u201dLet me ask you, are you my f*cking master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d was just a child. She could not speak clearly and had a lisp befitting of her age. However, she now had this indescribable aura billowing around her, because she was no longer human!</p><br/><p>When Liu Xing saw that \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d was alive and kicking, he was stunned. This was because \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d now had an army uniform on her, and it was the Chinese people army\u2019s uniform</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Who are you?\u201d Liu Xing found that he could not wrap his head around the situation. What kind of situation was this, and was this \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d the Tan Xiaoya from before?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy real name is Lee Yunlong, but right now I am \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d. The reason I am here is to join the war!\u201d \u201cTan Xiaoya spoke through her childish lisp.</p><br/><p>As a result, Liu Xing\u2019s sense of heroism was awakened again. Then, he said with all his righteousness to her, \u201cThe war does not need kids like you. Protecting the country is the responsibility of the army. As the future pillar of this country, all you have to do is to study hard. Once the war is over, you can help by rebuilding our country!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when he finished speaking, \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d was furious and stared directly at him. She shouted angrily, \u201cAre you saying that I am no soldier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xing could not agree to her joke. A five-year-old girl could never be a soldier, even if she is suddenly equipped with a big-*ss sword and dressed in a uniform that appeared from nowhere</p><br/><p>\u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d scolded him, \u201cHere I thought you were a genius, but it turns out that you are an idiot. I alone, am sufficient for this war!\u201d</p><br/><p>She snapped her fingers after she finished her speech. There was a ripple in the air behind her, and countless modern weapons materialized at her back. This scene left the main protagonist Liu Xing in awe!</p><br/><p>The plot that followed was still Liu Xing fighting against the Russian elite troop \u201cAlpha\u201d with his \u201cFierce Tiger Regiment\u201d. Of course, he brought along his servant \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d or Saber Lee, who he has inadvertently summoned</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Xing and his regiment members just sat back and watched as \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d vaporized the \u201cAlpha\u201d team while munching on dumplings. After going through half of the dumpling, she would throw away the other half and finish off the \u201cAlpha\u201d team!</p><br/><p>The story until now showed that \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d had made a scene with her \u201cdumpling grenade\u201d!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt awesome during the whole process. This is how invincibility should feel like!</p><br/><p>The plot development then became a one-man show for \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d. She used numerous, bizarre weapons to kill the Russians. In the end, she even summoned her Italian cannon and leveled the capital of Russia, Moscow.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had completely destroyed the world of this drama. She was then reminded by the Two Dimensional Gate that she could now travel to the next world already. However, she was not in a rush, because she wanted to see whether this would actually make it to the final cut of the series</p><br/><p>Of course, during the process of leveling Moscow, there was a scene of Liang Feifan reprimanding Liu Xing. However, ever since Liu Xing had the servant \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d, he did not have to endure his sh*t anymore. He shouted six words to Liang Feifan\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and eat sh*t, Liang Feifan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Feifan stated he was going to have Liu Xing court-martialed. However, before Liu Xing could say anything, \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d popped out from nowhere and shot Liang Feifan on the spot!</p><br/><p>There were corrupt, evil forces in the army who supported Liang Feifan, but \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d was not intimidated. She used her iron-willed resolve and eradicated all of them!</p><br/><p>Finally, \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d who had completed all her goals, or the servant Lee Yun long, bade her farewell to everyone with a smile on her face!</p><br/><p>It was truly a satisfactory ending!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was able to finish all that she needed to do within one night. She woke up feeling refreshed the next day. At the very least, she was able to flush out all the dissatisfaction due to the torturing of the main protagonist when watching the drama \u201cWar Hero\u201d. She just assumed it as one ridiculous dream.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt that her actions were no different to what she did in \u201cKing of Superpower\u201d. Of course, her scenes would never make it to the final cut. At least, that\u2019s what she thought</p><br/><p>In any case, Zhao Youyue felt that it did not matter to her. She never wanted to gain any new abilities from that world anyway, and just wanted to have fun. If she does not put her heart into it, it would be impossible for her to obtain an iconic character card.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Jianzhong was writing energetically on his desk. He was in a weirdly excited state. For some reason, his head was full of ideas and inspirations!</p><br/><p>Obviously, Lin Jianzhong had lost his senses. It was as if he had entered the world of \u201cWar Heroes\u201d, and saw the character \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d firsthand. Moreover, he even witnessed all her unique abilities, including the shocking scene of modern missiles flying wildly all over the place, and the Italian cannon leveling the entirety of Moscow</p><br/><p>He felt that these scenes were even more realistic and interesting than those big budget movies. The visual effects were truly amazing!</p><br/><p>He wanted to inject all these \u201cinspirations\u201d into the script for the story development!</p><br/><p>Obviously, he was intoxicated and did not realize how bad it was for this character \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d to appear!</p><br/><p>It all depends on when he \u201cwakes up\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

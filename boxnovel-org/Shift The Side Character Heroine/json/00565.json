After all, she was not something that everyone loved, like money. Wait, actually, not everyone was a fan of money. It sounds strange, but it was true. Such people probably lived in a different world. Regular folk might just as well give up trying to figure them out.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was very used to being refused, so she handled it very skillfully. Firstly, she handed out a sincere invitation, which expressed how highly she thought of Du Hang. Of course, she still could not look up to someone talentless like him!</p><br/><p>What of Zhou Cai? Well, Zhou Cai\u2019s computer skills were pretty good. Some people even thought that she was Majoring in Computer Science. What was she doing in the Chinese Department? With a straight face, she would reply, saying that her literacy skills were too poor. She simply wished to polish her skills\u2026</p><br/><p>She had done some research in private. The examinations in the Chinese department were really easy. She could cram the night before examinations and still pass with ease. Hence, she could spend more time on her hobbies.</p><br/><p>She did not come to this University to learn anything, nor was she here to socialize. All she wanted was the freedom that she had desired for so long!</p><br/><p>She had deliberately chosen to attend a university that was really far away from her home to be truly free.</p><br/><p>These four years of University life might be the most carefree and fun period in the lives of many. As a result, it would be over too soon. In a blink of an eye, those four years have passed. Then, when these people looked back, they would feel like they had not attended university at all. It was more like \u2013 University had attended them\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, the fact that Zhou Cai could be in the same dormitory as Lady Zhao only meant that she was highly fortunate. Just by being the Lady\u2019s roommate alone had given the Lady a reason to reel her into her society.</p><br/><p>In this university, the bond between roommates was a strong one.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhao Youyue tilted her head to the side, looking slightly lost, as if Du Hang had made a huge mistake by refusing her invitation.</p><br/><p>If this situation had been in a novel where Du Hang was the main protagonist, Lady Zhao\u2019s admirers would have gathered and shot lasers. They would be incredibly envious and resentful at Du Hang. They would feel embarrassed, as the protagonist was giving them a live show on how to be a decent human being.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Du Hang was not the protagonist. Zhao Youyue was also a master tactician. She had memorized Du Hang\u2019s schedule and knew just where and when to find him.</p><br/><p>It was evening. After eating his dinner in the cafeteria, he always enjoyed walking alone in the playground. He enjoyed the feeling of being deep in thought while walking leisurely.</p><br/><p>Life might be meaningless to many because they occupied themselves with such unnecessary concerns. Some people wanted to stand taller, some wanted to earn more money, some wanted power \u2013 because life had made them do so. Some people had these desires because they were not satisfied. This was the only way it gave them life, and this gave that life meaning.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, this would save them the time spent on thinking about life, or simply the time wasted. For a loner like Du Hang, thinking about life was the purpose of life itself. Being deep in his existential musings only gave him more convictions in his own beliefs.</p><br/><p>He was very skeptical of the day when he would eventually drift with the tide. This was probably a type of sophohigh syndrome that people called \u201ceveryone is drunk, I alone am sober.\u201d However, he would rather suffer from this syndrome for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>With her knowledge of Du Hang\u2019s routine, Zhao Youyue seized the opportunity to conquer an eccentric man like him. This nagging feeling told her that if this guy were to create something, he would definitely be able to come up with works that were pretty amazing \u2013 if he made adequate preparations.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? As people always say, you don\u2019t need a reason to like someone. Of course, I don\u2019t need a reason to refuse someone as well. You\u2019re not that narcissistic, right? Do you really think that as long as you open your mouth, everyone in the world would listen to you?\u201d Du Hang said calmly.</p><br/><p>It was harsh, but it was the blunt truth. Now, Zhao Youyue had been cleared of the rumors, and her Missy identity had also been exposed. All the students were talking about her, yearning for her. Hence, in such a situation, she would inevitably become full of herself, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019m gratified with how you refused my invitation. I\u2019ll still come back to look for you, no, I think there\u2019s this one person who might be better at communicating with you, compared to me\u2026 What exactly is it that you want?\u201d Zhao Youyue was still smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t crave language. I already have all I need. It\u2019s surely not a matter of hoping to understand each other, hoping to get along with each other, hoping to stay with each other and such. I don\u2019t need others to understand me. All I want is to understand and to make things clear. I want to understand so that I can have peace of mind, earn my tranquility. I fear the unknown. I feel that wanting to fully understand something is a self-righteous and arrogant desire. People would get fed up with you if you\u2019re very mean. I\u2019m hopelessly disgusted by this kind of people,\u201d Du Hang habitually said things that ordinary folk would never wrap their minds around.</p><br/><p>The average person would never understand his desires. Zhao Youyue felt that the best candidate to deal with this oddity would be Han Leng. Those two young hipsters definitely spoke a common language.</p><br/><p>At the end of the day, Lady Zhao was still better at getting along with girls.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue left, satisfied. She had been right about Du Hang. Then, she immediately contacted Han Leng, hoping that the little angel Leng Zi could shake Big Teacher Du Hang out of his autism. This was the perfect cure!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me! Out of all the boys in the class, he\u2019s the one I\u2019m most unfamiliar with. It\u2019s impossible to communicate with him\u2026\u201d Of course, Han Leng was vehemently against the idea of trying to recruit Du Hang into the society. Du Hang was a complete stranger. Even so, he was intrigued by this fellow hipster.</p><br/><p>Lonely forces would always attract. Most ideal creators were lonely because their spiritual worlds outweighed the material world.</p><br/><p>Sadly, The Great Scholar Han had grown very arrogant at this point. He had grown accustomed to the fact that others would take the initiative to become friends with him, rather than the opposite. He was sure that if he took the initiative, he would be at a loss.</p><br/><p>Thinking of losing was already a loss. But if one lost a little beforehand, the thrill of winning would be all the more exceptional.</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the crap. I\u2019ll give you his contact information. You can make your plans in your own time. First, start from the internet. Once you have a better relationship, you can also try sending some fan service photos (*\u2267\u25bd\u2266)~~ That\u2019s all you have to do, won\u2019t you help me, Mister Leng Zi? Are you really going to let my society fail before your eyes and finally watch me fail to become the President of the Student Council? o(\u2565_\u2565)o\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Lady, maybe you shouldn\u2019t overdo the cute acting. It\u2019s not like you at all. I\u2019m getting goosebumps! Also, don\u2019t call me Leng Zi, it always gives me a feeling like you\u2019re not up to something good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have one week then, it\u2019s settled!\u201d Zhao Youyue barked out the order \u2013 there was no way Han Leng could refuse.</p></div>\n</div>"}

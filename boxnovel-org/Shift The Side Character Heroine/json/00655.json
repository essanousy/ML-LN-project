She was petite; her face was framed by golden locks that complemented her green eyes.</p><br/><p>Along with Triss Merigold, she served under Temeria and its king, Foltest.</p><br/><p>She was not afraid of anything, all except rats.</p><br/><p>A perverted woman, she was not shy with her usage of her self-concocted aphrodisiacs.</p><br/><p>Keira was extremely satisfied with her life at Temeria, as she got to enjoy the life of nobility. That was why she couldn\u2019t stop herself from commenting on Kaer Morhen.</p><br/><p>Keira thought that it was madness to travel to Kaer Morhen, especially during the winter.</p><br/><p>However, Triss\u2019 determination had piqued Keira\u2019s curiosity. Who was this White Wolf, and what kind of person was he? What was it that made Triss so devoted?</p><br/><p>Perhaps she might one day find out.</p><br/><p>Keira Metz was also present in Gwent. She also represented the Northern Realms and possessed a combat power of 5. She was quoted as saying, \u201cIf I were to die today, I would want it to be grand and worthwhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>From that alone, we can deduce that Keira had a flair for the dramatic and theatrical. To achieve a stable and secure life, she would use all means and methods possible.</p><br/><p>Of course, they say that those who live on the fast track would crash and burn someday.</p><br/><p>Triss ignored Keira\u2019s snide remarks and went on her journey.</p><br/><p>As she traveled to Kaer Morhen, she started to realize that her life back at the castle was far more comfortable and peaceful. Her love for Geralt was so intense that she would sacrifice everything for him. This was why many have lamented about Geralt\u2019s ineptness when it came to love.</p><br/><p>Regardless of the impending discomfort, she had already decided to travel to Kaer Morhen and suffer. It was her feelings for Geralt that were to blame, not her.</p><br/><p>Little did Triss know that within Kaer Morhen\u2019s walls, things had been busy all winter. This was all due to Olivia\u2019s intervention.</p><br/><p>If Olivia had not been there, those ragged witchers at Kaer Morhen would only continue to further disgrace themselves and bring nothing but shame to the eyes of the sorceress.</p><br/><p>Cirilla would never waste her time on such frills as she was already used to having it hard. She had been escaping danger since her youth \u2013 she was nothing like a sheltered, pampered princess that one would expect.</p><br/><p>At Kaer Morhen, not only Geralt and Vesemir were present, three other witchers had joined them \u2013 Co\u00ebn, Eskel, and Lambert.</p><br/><p>Co\u00ebn was a witcher from Poviss. Unlike normal monster hunters, Co\u00ebn face was covered with massive scars from his youth, although he made use of his mustache to cover up some of the wounds. This may indicate that he had some kind of illness that no one knew off, or he merely started his monster hunter training much later, compared to others.</p><br/><p>Co\u00ebn noticed that Cirilla had some talent with the sword. He could not contain his excitement and ended up providing her with suggestions and pointers. He had now fallen in Olivia\u2019s pocket. He would remain in Kaer Morhen for a long while now, contributing to its new lease in life.</p><br/><p>Despite his flappy tongue, he was rather good-natured. His daily routine, when given an errand, was to complain all about it while completing that said errand.</p><br/><p>Lambert was the youngest out of all the monster hunters, and most likely the last. However, he had proven his skills countless times, leaving a trail of monster corpses from Poviss to Toussaint.</p><br/><p>However, Lambert also possessed an ill temper. He barely meant what he said most of the time. He simply loved taunting others, even earning the ire of other monster hunters of the same school.</p><br/><p>Geralt always described Lambert in a single phrase\u2014Lambert oh Lambert\u2026 So naughty, yet so dumb.</p><br/><p>Lambert seemed like a bad person, but he was very loyal and caring towards his friends. No matter what nasty words spewed out of his mouth, he would not hesitate to toss himself into danger to save his friends. On the other hand, he did not care much about countries and politics.</p><br/><p>Lambert was in charge of teaching Cirilla on how to move on a confined space. He showed a surprising amount of patience towards Cirilla, as if he appreciated and acknowledged her hard work. There was also the possibility of how he never saw Cirilla as a female, that\u2019s why the training was going so smoothly.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, he detested the charismatic \u201cPearl of the North\u201d Olivia, as if all sorceresses were his natural enemies.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Olivia thought that Lambert was amusing to watch. Despite his sharp tongue, his body was honest. Olivia wished that he would be able to find himself a sorceress girlfriend in the future.</p><br/><p>Eskel was also a monster hunter of the wolf school, and was in fact Geralt\u2019s friend, but unlike Geralt, he did not possess the \u201cProtagonist Aura\u201d. Due to this, he would often insult Geralt \u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Wolf, I\u2019m just a plain, old witcher. I don\u2019t hunt for dragons, and I don\u2019t forge brotherly pacts with kings, and I don\u2019t get to feel the warmth of sorceresses in bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>In many ways, Eskel was like Geralt\u2019s brother. They were of the same age, and had known each other since youth, as they still wielded wooden swords at Kaer Morhen. They had both been through many tests, from being selected, to undergoing the Trial of Grasses, to experiencing their body changes and even taking part in the Training Challenge that was well known among witchers.</p><br/><p>They had been rebellious since young, and were both very familiar to Vesemir\u2019s method of punishment. They went their separate ways after growing up, but they would still meet up at Kaer Morhen every winter, getting drunk as they waited for Spring and reminisced over the memories of their dead friends from the war.</p><br/><p>Eskel was not as famous as Geralt, but his experience was on par with the White Wolf. Thus, he was similarly skilled. Throughout his adventures, he had almost lost his life on more than one occasion.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the scar on his face was not from a monster. Instead, it was the blade-markings of Sabrina Glevissig, who was known as the \u201cChild of Misfortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eskel and Geralt were like brothers, but that was where their similarities ended. He was warm, calm and quiet but he was bad the girls. If it was not for the scar on his face and his monster hunter identity, he would have definitely been well liked.</p><br/><p>Olivia was also rather fond of this geezer. Eskel had probably warmed up the most to Olivia\u2019s thought of transforming the old-fashioned Kaer Morhen.</p></div>\n</div>"}

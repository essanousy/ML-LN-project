They were headed towards the Kaer Trolde harbor in Skellige Isles.</p><br/><p>Calanthe had been prepared to die and preserve her dignity. However, all of these feelings vanished as she was shoved through Olivia\u2019s portal. She was currently too confused to think of suicide.</p><br/><p>Calanthe was a stubborn creature, but she was not Xiang Yu who \u201crefused to cross the Jiangdong river.\u201d[1] Since she was alive now, she would seize this new life and revive the fallen Cintra Kingdom!</p><br/><p>Moreover, her mind was currently occupied by her youngest granddaughter \u2014- \u2014- Olivia. Her perfect little face that was as delicate as a doll \u2013 paired with her extreme indifference made it hard for Calanthe to forget her.</p><br/><p>In any case, Olivia had saved her life, despite how she had always favored Cirilla. She had always felt that Cirilla was more like her. As for Olivia \u2013 she had no words to describe her. Either way, she could not bring herself to get closer to her\u2026</p><br/><p>Calanthe did not want to admit it. \u201cIf you hate the house, you would hate the crow sitting on the roof as well.\u201d After all, Olivia\u2019s education had been carried out, per the arrangements of her son-in-law, Duny, who she truly detested. Naturally, she would associate Olivia to Duny\u2019s stigma.</p><br/><p>Of course, Calanthe still did not know that Duny was actually Emperor Emhyr of the Nilfgaardian Empire. Otherwise, she would most certainly react rather agitatedly, to say the least. It would have been a flurry of slaps to her face. This was far too cruel for and old queen like her.</p><br/><p>After all, her very own son-in-law had razed her kingdom to the ground. She had almost lost her life, and the one who saved her was her least favorite granddaughter. She was now in a safe place. As for her granddaughters, regardless of it being Cirilla or Olivia, she only hoped that they were safe, and that she would be able to reunite with them one day.</p><br/><p>After Calanthe heard Ermion referring to Olivia as a genius female sorceress, she could hardly believe it. She had a \u201chow is that possible\u201d look on her face. However, when she thought about how Olivia could open portals and transport others through it, just like other sorcerers \u2013 even though she was so young, she had to accept that fact.</p><br/><p>In this world, almost all highly-skilled sorcerers with strong bloodlines knew how to open portals. The only difference was how many could they transport, how far could these people transported, and how accurate the transportations were.</p><br/><p>Olivia was actually an exception. She had forcibly used the portal skill that could only be used by high-leveled players \u2013 with the help of the game system. As a result, she had used too much mana and collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorceresses don\u2019t sprout from out of nowhere. Did you secretly teach her magic, Ermion?\u201d Calanthe could not help but pry.</p><br/><p>Ermion shook his head. He had no clue. In actuality, as a friend and royal advisor of King Bran, he stayed in the Skellige Isles more often.</p><br/><p>If Ermion found out that Olivia\u2019s sorcerer teacher was that \u201cVilgefortz of Roggeveen,\u201d he would definitely say \u201cno wonder.\u201d Vilgefortz was not exactly a well-liked character, but it did not mean that they could dismiss his powers. His prestige over many years was so widely known among the rulers and the casters that everyone knew who he was.</p><br/><p>However, when Vilgefortz was in the Kingdom of Cintra, he had kept a low profile. Otherwise, his great reputation alone would have been more than enough for him to become the head Sorcerer of the Cintra Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Vilgefortz was not interested in the small Kingdom of Cintra.</p><br/><p>Now that Emhyr has stabilized his position as Emperor, he was also living a good life in the Nilfgaard. However, he still did not intend to reveal his full powers. Instead, he continued to remain hidden. Obviously, he had something more profound in mind.</p><br/><p>In fact, Vilgefortz never even taught Olivia seriously. He simply used this get closer to Emhyr. He did not think much about Olivia, who had not been born with source blood. Olivia was not even a source sorcerer. What future would she have?</p><br/><p>However, as a disciple of Vilgefortz, Olivia could rely on her teacher\u2019s name to act like a big shot and bully others by flaunting her connections \u2013 if she wanted to.</p><br/><p>Calanthe, who could not get much from Ermion, decided to remain silent. She decided that she would ask Olivia about it the next time she sees her.</p><br/><p>When that time comes, one could only imagine the circumstances.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cintra castle. It\u2019s compound drenched in blood.</p><br/><p>Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach was the captain of an elite unit, appointed by Emperor Emhyr himself. This was most definitely the special forces of the medieval era. Even his equipment was nothing like that of regular knights.</p><br/><p>He had already gained renown as a young knight of the Nilfgaardian Empire. He was even featured on Gwent, in the Nilfgaardian Empire deck. Unfortunately, it was not a hero card, but a rather ordinary card. The card only had six battle points and had no special abilities.</p><br/><p>The flavor text of his card described him rather aptly \u2014- \u2014- His eyes flashed under his winged helmet, fire gleamed from his sword\u2019s blade.</p><br/><p>He was here to find the two Princesses of Cintra and bring them back to the Emperor safely.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, Emhyr trusted him very much to assign him to this mission. His father was a seneschal[2] at Emperor Emhyr\u2019s royal house.</p><br/><p>Of course, Cahir would be most enthusiastic. This was the utmost of honors, and the rewards would be tremendous. Of course, if he failed this, there would also be serious consequences.</p><br/><p>He did not know much about the two Princesses of Cintra himself. He had heard of \u201cCirilla\u2019s\u201d from the Emperor himself. In Olivia\u2019s case, her \u201cPearl of the Northern Kingdoms\u201d title had spread all the way to the Nilfgaardian Empire.</p><br/><p>Rumors always became more and more exaggerated in the process of circulation. Obviously, Olivia was just an eleven-year-old girl, but based on the rumors, many people thought that Olivia was the most beautiful princess in the Northern realms. A peerless beauty, a femme fatale\u2026</p><br/><p>Those who knew nothing about the true relationship between Emperor Emhyr and Princess Olivia would even think that the Emperor had declared war on the Northern Kingdom just so that he could capture the \u201cPearl of the Northern Kingdoms\u201d and decorate his own crown.</p><br/><p>Cahir was extremely curious about the \u201cPearl of the Northern Kingdoms.\u201d However, he did not dare to harbor any inappropriate thoughts. The Emperor\u2019s secret order was his priority. No one did not know that the Emperor was harsh and greedy. He was someone who would disco dance on the top of someone else\u2019s tombstone.</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] Xiang Yu () \u2013 Xiang Ji, courtesy name Yu, better known as Xiang Yu, was a prominent warlord who lived in the late Qin dynasty.

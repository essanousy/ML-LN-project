That would surely derail the other voice actors. She was merely intimately familiar with the role. She had firsthand experience of everything else in the novel; those memories have all been branded on her mind!</p><br/><p>As she spoke each line, she felt herself entering the literary world once again, speaking in place of Yu Shengfan. The mysterious, \u201cintoxicated\u201d feeling emerged once again, drawing out the best in her!</p><br/><p>Of course, part of it was Zhao Youyue\u2019s own great efforts, but most of it had something to do with the mysterious power of the iconic character card. She performed the role to perfection, using a method that can never be emulated by anyone else, by being the character in the flesh!</p><br/><p>The same rules of logic of an average voice actor could not be used to measure Zhao Youyue\u2019s abilities. Nobody can ever claim that it is that easy to step into the shoes of a particular character and \u2018be\u2019 the character, because nobody had iconic character cards of their own.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s voice acting, not only conquered the heart of her fellow voice actors and the animation supervisor, Dong Yang; she also made the original author, Ye Hai lean back in contentment. He felt that he had made the right choice, a wild card like Zhao Youyue had brought out the authentic essence of Yu Shengfan!</p><br/><p>That night, Ye Hai invited Dong Yang and the few main voice actors for dinner, to officially introduce Zhao Youyue to everyone and nurture a friendly working environment.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai knew that Dong Yang had his initial doubts about Zhao Youyue, but her acting skills today had shown that she could play the role of Yu Shengfan without any problem. Would this change things with Dong Yang?</p><br/><p>Dong Yang was not a particularly strict animation supervisor, and neither was his heart small.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai hoped that this meal would break the ice, so that the animation crew could work together as a team, and let them know that this mysterious voice actress had what it took to stand amongst them. He had not made his choice because of a personal bias or because a deal was made under the counter.</p><br/><p>With this misunderstanding cleared out, they could turn the release of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d animation in September into an effective way of promotion. They could simply lure the enraged audience into watching the animation, and with the perfect voice acting of Zhao Youyue, they would be convinced!</p><br/><p>All questions would be cleared up in smoke!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this was all the scheme. Even though many had taken this the wrong way, if promoted right, would set them back on track!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was all too familiar with these sorts of meals which served to improve relationships between humans. Her family practiced this all the time. So, she hoisted her cup without much deliberation and toasted Dong Yang. Of course, it contained nothing but fizzy soft drinks.</p><br/><p>The prejudice that Dong Yang had previously was already gone when he saw her amazing acting skills. He did not know how to describe her technique, all he knew was that she was a wild card. She was unlike all other voice actors. Unorthodox as her methods may be, she brought \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d as close to real life as she could be!</p><br/><p>If only Zhao Youyue could reproduce such effects when it comes to every other animated character, animation companies would definitely compete for her. Dong Yang even wanted to have her teach other voice actors, so that they could perform as well as her\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, Dong Yang was just fantasizing all of this. Zhao Youyue could only perform so well due to her iconic character card, and with the help of that mysterious power, little fish could easily voice herself in a dramatization of her life\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>Also, the world would gain a new level of respect and push the character to new heights of fame. In a way, Zhao Youyue would be helping herself, boosting the effects of her Yu Shengfan card.</p><br/><p>When the animation is aired, and her role is well-received, Yu Shengfan\u2019s popularity would undoubtedly increase, and she might unlock even more of the iconic card\u2019s hidden ability.</p><br/><p>Even though iconic character cards had no expiry dates, they would perform differently in different situations. Iconic character cards were very versatile indeed.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s take little fish for example. When she was at the peak of her popularity, Zhao Youyue would have flawless gaming skills upon activation. But when she is experiencing a usual quiet day, Zhao Youyue\u2019s gaming skill would become average; this was a dynamic equilibrium.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue now had a better understanding towards the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d and \u201cIconic Character Card,\u201d and she did feel the need of acquiring more iconic character cards.</p><br/><p>Of course, if opportunity allows it, she would not blame herself for having too many wives, more lovers are always welcome!</p><br/><p>Wives are meant for one to spend time together for the rest of their lives, lovers such as \u201chigh popularity character cards,\u201d were meant for a short-lived but fulfilling fling. She has never earned a \u201chigh popularity character card\u201d before as a disposable item, but they definitely had their own uses. Despite the presence of a time limit, she would be able to treasure every single moment with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Shengfan\u201d had initially started off as a \u201chigh popularity character card,\u201d but Rosemary had turned it into something else entirely. Zhao Youyue couldn\u2019t do anything about it, if a lover decides to marry her as a wife. Naturally, it did not cost her any loss\u2026</p><br/><p>The dinner went off well. When Dong Yang and Song Gang found out that Zhao Youyue was just a first-year high school student who was about to enter her second year, they were shocked!</p><br/><p>A high school student who knew how to mingle with adults, was amazing. Of course, her voice acting skills were even more so\u2026</p><br/><p>When Song Gang saw how easily Zhao Youyue got around the others, he felt that he had wasted all his years living, he was really abysmal at socializing!</p><br/><p>Dong Yang had even asked Zhao Youyue if she was interested in building up her career on voice acting, and offered her roles for his next animation project. Her performance had blown him away, body, mind and soul.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue turned down the offer, saying that she was only willing to voice act for \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d because she (was her wif\u2026) liked the character very much. Ye Hai had created \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d character upon her request as well, so she was willing to voice act her favorite character(s), and no other.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue also hoped that they would write the cast for the voice of Yu Shengfan as Yu Shengfan herself\u2026</p><br/><p>This request earned an incredulous stare from Dong Yang, but when everyone around the table learned of Lady Zhao Youyue\u2019s identity, they quickly understood. When the lady intends to keep a low profile, they would do their best to cooperate.</p><br/><p>If they can no longer hide the truth, they would just say that the mysterious voice actor for Yu Shengfan was a female streamer from Douyu. It could be considered as a form of advertisement for her not-so-popular live stream, because she has never once displayed her face.</p><br/><p>As the session went on with eerie fluidity, everyone soon discovered yet another talent of Zhao Youyueher singing!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Only a few would defend themselves until their last breaths. Hence, their courage was commendable.</p><br/><p>Since Olivia had been left in an unconscious state, Zhao Youyue temporarily left the source world to head back to reality. She had to regain her bearings and make sure that she was from planet Earth, and she was Zhao Youyue, not Olivia.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Olivia seemed like a good name to call herself. Lady Olivia Zhao. It almost sounded as fun as \u201cNicolas Zhao Si\u201d [1]. However, Lady Zhao was a traditional Chinese Lady who defended the National Culture. After all, the Zhao Family was known for its patriotism. They were the only family who had the right to betray its country, since they had built this country right from the bottom.</p><br/><p>When Lady Zhao went back to reality, she realized that the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d had recorded everything in the source world, like the paranormal world. Now it had even taken the liberty to convert the history into a fantastical drama. [2]</p><br/><p>She could upload the video on a computer to play it, or upload it onto the internet. If It picked up, she could gather the energy and recharge the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d It was not something could be explained with science.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue uploaded her paranormal exploits onto the internet, fans of horror novels had praised and promoted the video. The reactions of the actors had been so authentic and real that their screams of terror went right into the bone\u2026</p><br/><p>However, horror novels were not exactly mainstream. Even the storylines were short and straightforward. The only attractive part of their movie was the special effects and blood. Past that, they lacked the impact.</p><br/><p>Some people could not forget about these films, such as an author who was know for his horror novel. He was still disturbed by the fact that his dream had been turned into a film and uploaded onto the internet.</p><br/><p>No matter how he tried to make logic out of it, he would never fathom the possibility of the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d existing.</p><br/><p>Compared to that paranormal video, Zhao Youyue played a central role as Olivia. If uploaded to the internet, it would most definitely become viral. Its quality would be no lesser than that of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d[3]</p><br/><p>So, what should she call this series? She might not be the protagonist in the source world, but she damn well may be. After all, she was the one controlling the game system!</p><br/><p>Should she try something like \u201cLive Broadcast of the Empress,\u201d [4] or perhaps something like \u201cThe Path of an Empress,\u201d or simply \u201cOlivia\u201d?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could not make up her mind. This time, she would not have to worry about investigations being carried out on the \u2018actors.\u2019 None of them existed in this world.</p><br/><p>Most of the scenes could be passed off as highly advanced computer-generated graphics.</p><br/><p>The source world itself existed in an epic fantasy game which was engineered to be displayed in high-definition quality. It was nothing like the paranormal world which came from some \u201cmovie.\u201d</p><br/><p>That paranormal world was the birthplace of many horror films. Chu Renmei was a ghost from the movie \u201cA Wicked Ghost,\u201d the mere thought of which could rob people of their sleep. [5]</p><br/><p>That was the only way to prove that Chu Renmei was more than qualified to exist in that world.</p><br/><p>A great author must first venture deep into a source world. Only then could they write remarkable stories.</p><br/><p>Source worlds and iconic novels existed symbiotically. It was the birthplace where authors received inspiration for their novels, or one could argue that was merely a plane where authors\u2019 subconscious gathered, their similar wavelengths working together to create entire worlds.</p><br/><p>The question then, what came first \u2013 the source worlds, or the iconic novels?</p><br/><p>It was the same as \u201cthe first chicken and the egg argument.\u201d There was no need to find the answer.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue briefly scrolled through the computer-generated drama of the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d There weren\u2019t many epic scenes, other than the harmonious moment between Cirilla and Olivia. Of course, Olivia fighting alongside Geralt in the witch-hunting mission had been amazing.</p><br/><p>Olivia was as cool as Saber, [6] charging into the fight with her invisible Excalibur. [7][8] With a roll-over and a \u201cbackstab of justice,\u201d she had instantly ended a Fogler.[9]</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not rush to upload the film, as she sensed her body in the source world starting to gain consciousness.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was worried that Olivia might get killed by some idiotic soldiers. Would that be the end of her play in the source world?</p><br/><p>It would not affect Zhao Youyue in reality, but she had big plans for Olivia. It would be great if she could become an Empress and take her own sister as her spouse!</p><br/><p>She would learn so many new things in the process!</p><br/><p>The Source world was a hundred percent identical to reality. She did not need to fabricate any iconic character to inherit the character\u2019s special abilities. While honing her skills in the source world, both her body in reality and the source world would benefit from the training.</p><br/><p>Olivia found herself in a carriage when she woke up. Worried about her condition, she instantly accessed the game system to check on her body. No damages found, what a relief! Unfortunately, she still could not access the blue bar.</p><br/><p>Indeed, it had been a risky move. However, the computer-generated animation had one more epic scene to show! Now that Calanthe was safe, Cirilla would be delighted.</p><br/><p>Hold on, where\u2019s Cirilla?</p><br/><p>That was when a new mission showed up in the game system. The search for Cirilla.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Nicolas Zhao Si (.) is a character played by Liu Xiaoguang () in the TV comedy series \u201cCountryside Love.\u201d In a few of the series, Zhao Si performed a few street dances that \u201coutshined the Hollywood star, even Nicolas Cage.\u201d Because his dances were much similar towards Melbourne Shuffle Dance, he was also known as the creator of Chinese Shuffle Dance</p><br/><p>[2] High Fantasy () or epic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy, defined either by the epic nature of its setting or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, or plot.

It was not that her ending was alluring, instead, it had ticked off numerous readers. Having followed her Weibo, they could then lash out on her whenever they wanted. Below her latest Weibo post, there were vigorous responses from the readers as such \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ending of \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 is like feeding us sh*ts! I won\u2019t read the works written by this bastard mangaka anymore! But I\u2019ll still be in your Weibo to troll you everyday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let that scumbag hero Yang Ming die\u2026 I detest scumbags anyway. But\u2026 why not giving Xu Jing a good ending? Come on mangaka, she had been suffering so much, can\u2019t you just sympathize with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think this Su Li must be a hardcore fan of Urobuchi Gen. That\u2019s why she had deliberately come out with such an ending where almost everyone are dead. Is she trying to play with the innocent readers like us? Still I\u2019ve to admit, she had successfully created a big news, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t forget this \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 for the rest of my live! Full support for my Goddess Xu Jing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pissed off! This dramatic change of drawing style is totally unpredictable! It\u2019s almost poisonous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ending scene of Xu Jing in a lily white dress, standing by the sea was perfectly beautiful! I had cried a river upon seeing it. Sob, I really want to give her a hug\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe character of Yang Xixi was deplorable. To forcefully give Xu Jing a wistful ending, you have specified that Yang Xixi would only love her brother deadly till the end of time. I\u2019m\u2026 speechless. If this could happen in reality, for sure there won\u2019t be a ridiculous ending like \u2018nice boat\u2019. Hugging someone\u2019s chopped-off head while sailing towards the sunset? Ugh, that is gut-churning! You must have done it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will just laugh, and share out the promises you\u2019d made to the readers on Weibo. Haha, everyone let\u2019s see how sketchy is this hateful mangaka. For all the times she promised a happy and complete ending for \u2018Pure Romance\u2019, it was just to trap more and more readers, then rip them all apart abruptly! I have seen through your scheme, mangaka. Well, well, this society is dangerous indeed! Wait, why don\u2019t you just go and eat sh*ts? Broadcast it live to everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at the widespread criticisms of Su Li on Weibo, Zhao Youyue\u2019s mouth curved in a smile. Ultimately, all of this was Su Li\u2019s fault. Why would she suddenly pay attention to the character of \u201cXu Jing\u201d? Why would she decide to abuse \u201cXu Jing\u201d? This had deprived her of the opportunities to study. Thus as Xu Jing\u2019s \u201cmaster\u201d, Zhao Youyue had to launch a fierce counter attack!</p><br/><p>Besides railing against Su Li on Weibo, everyone also discussed about \u201cXu Jing\u201d, and it seemed that the discussion would only get more intense by time. Almost seventy percent of the readers were on Su Li\u2019s side. They were so sympathetic towards Xu Jing, and reckoned that Su Li was flying in the face of the readers by drawing her dead. Some readers commented that they would be down in the dumps for at least half a month upon this ending\u2026</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, there were some eccentric readers who liked to do gimmicks. They had condemned \u201cXu Jing\u201d with these unorthodox viewpoints \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWithin the entire \u2018Pure Romance\u2019, the biggest troublemaker was actually Xu Jing. Yeah, this female character was the culprit who led the manga down the path of a miserable ending! It was just that some people were blinded by their emotions. Deeply moved by Xu Jing\u2019s poor background and so-called passion in studies, they had inadvertently fallen heads over heels for her. In fact, this girl was subtle and full of schemes, not to mention that her morals were twisted, thus she always resorted to extreme approaches to achieve her aims. Had she not stirred up so much troubles, the hero would not go rogue, then all the characters would be able to live happily, right? Hence, Xu Jing\u2019s wistful ending was of her own making. She deserved to die, and she had brought death upon herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery pathetic person must have something despicable about them. A girl like Xu Jing was too scary, and akin to the natural enemy of guys. As a straight guy, I\u2019m bothered by her yuri character which competes with the guys for pretty girls. Also, I couldn\u2019t bear the sight of her plotting against the hero Yang Ming. I\u2019m not sure what Su Li was thinking, how could she come up with such a troublemaking character at the first place? She was not even a member of the hero\u2019s harem, this had completely deviated from the conventional route of a Harem manga. Luckily my heart was strong enough to endure this, otherwise I must have given up this manga long ago. Anyway, what\u2019s so bad about Xu Jing\u2019s death in the end? Wasn\u2019t it delightful? Now, our eyes no longer need to suffer from seeing her pathetic face in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Following the appearance of these comments, without a doubt, the loyal guardians of Goddess Xu Jing had become restless. They surged out to support Xu Jing \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Jing did everything out of true love. What\u2019s wrong with plotting against the hero? Could the hero Yang Ming be more responsible and more impervious to seductions, he would not be thinking with his penis. Then Xu Jing\u2019s scheme would be futile. Don\u2019t make it sounds like everything was Xu Jing\u2019s fault, some people really have incredible logics! Yang Ming was a natural scumbag, so he had to die, but Xu Jing was innocent! Unfortunately, Xu Jing was blinded by her love towards another scumbag Yang Xixi. Sure enough, these two were brother and sister, as the same type of persons live under the same roof. Yang Xixi had been making use of Xu Jing as a substitute all the way, yet kicked her away in the end. To think that there would be some who had complimented her faithfulness in love. If she loved her brother that much, why didn\u2019t she reject Xu Jing since the beginning? Just let Xu Jing go dating with her studies. I had strongly believed in Xu Jing\u2019s adamance, but eventually, she was sinking deeper and deeper. At last, I could do nothing except heaving a long sigh over the miserable ending. In any case, I want to emphasize, that the soul character of \u201cPure Romance\u201d is Xu Jing, and only Xu Jing\u2019s name could match the title \u201cPure Romance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSupport my Goddess Xu Jing forever! Putting it bluntly, if it was not because of Xu Jing, could such a second-class Harem manga possibly set the world on fire? I can\u2019t believe there are people who could say that Xu Jing deserved death. She reaped what she sowed! The hell is that? Do you guys have no conscience?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout Goddess Xu Jing, there wouldn\u2019t be you bunch of clowns who had cooked up all sorts of exaggerated remarks solely to seek attention! I suspect that you guys had lost your mind after reading the horrific ending, thus you intentionally made those remarks to look for rebukes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The war of comments between the readers over Xu Jing\u2019s ending was unstoppable, that it might even last forever. Seeing that, Zhao Youyue realized that she had successfully crafted an iconic female character. Subsequently, she saw one picture of a two dimensional character with a basic ponytail, appearing above the miraculous \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d in her mind. It was the character card of \u201cXu Jing\u201d. She was still holding a book, expressionless.</p><br/><p>Touching this character card with her spiritual sense, Zhao Youyue discovered three uses of the card for now, as more uses would probably be unlocked in future. For the present options, the first was the normal usage to inherit all character abilities of \u201cXu Jing\u201d; the second was one-time sacrifice of the character card to select a literature world of equivalent energy level; the third was also one-time sacrifice of the character card, but to enter a literature world of higher energy level! Of course, this world of higher energy level would be random, not selectable\u2026</p>\n</div>"}

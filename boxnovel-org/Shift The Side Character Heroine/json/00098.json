For every post on my Weibo, the comments, shares and likes are at least ten times more than yours! What do you think, Zhao Ritian?\u201d Zhang Wanjun twitched her mouth, saying that in her neutral tone, which was hard to tell whether it was a male or female voice while adjusting her frameless spectacles in style.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao let out a hollow laugh, \u201cHey! Why did you call me Zhao Ritian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Wanjun either, disgusting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026 Technically I\u2019m still your cousin by blood, I can give anything you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of the famous uploaders in Bilibili, do you seriously think that I would lack of anything? Besides, I\u2019m not interested in sports cars or luxury watches either, I can buy my own PC, games and limited edition merchandise by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, you win! But you\u2019ve never played \u2018LoL\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat game is too mainstream, yet it\u2019s a rip-off of another game, it will ruin my reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still it is the most played game in the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd yet your lousy team had never been qualified for the LPL, I\u2019ve only seen them took part once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh ho? You\u2019ve been paying attention to my lousy team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only wanted to see how you failed miserably, and how\u2019s the feeling of wasting money on nothing? It seems to have no impact on you, since you got plenty of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! Going after girls with money is the best, those girls are unlike you who doesn\u2019t have any ladylike features.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA scumbag like you is destined to get butchered with nice boat ending.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere we go again, what the heck are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Both of them were insulting each other with sarcasm, like they always did, they appeared to be arguing. Zhao Youyue decided not to stop them after listening to the duo carefully, it sounded merely like a normal conversation between them. Thus, she ignored them and started playing with her phone.</p><br/><p>They had been quarrelling until they reached their destination, then they only realized that there was still a person onboard. Both of them apologized to Zhao Youyue embarrassingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro and big sis are amazing, I\u2019m fine with just playing my phone alone. I\u2019m gonna watch big sis\u2019s video when I go back, it should be exciting since big sis has so many fans!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Wanjun clung to Zhao Youyue\u2019s arm, feeling that her little sister was really great. She also warned Zhao Youyue about scumbag Zhao Hao, wanting her to stay away from this terrible rich 2G.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao decided to overlook this matter to avoid arguing with Zhang Wanjun. He realized that there was still one hour left before the movie when he bought the tickets by his phone. He could not just spend that one hour with them in front of a UFO catcher, right?</p><br/><p>Zhang Wanjun suggested them to go cyber cafe for killing time, Zhao Hao agreed with it. He then realized that Zhao Youyue was still a minor, but she assured them that she would be alright by just sitting beside them while playing with her phone. This had made Zhao Hao liked his little cousin even more. After that they went to the cyber cafe.</p><br/><p>Before reaching the cafe, Zhao Youyue suddenly remembered the scene of riding in a limo to the cyber caf\u00e9 in \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d. It did not seem ridiculous after all, she chuckled.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wanjun revealed her \u201cinternet addict lady\u201d self when she sat down in front of a computer, ignoring everything around her. Where did her \u201cdisciplined\u201d attitude go to?</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao was not impatient like Zhang Wanjun. He bought three bottles of drinks, then he placed one bottle at Zhang Wanjun\u2019s desk and gave another bottle to Zhao Youyue to show that he cared for her. \u201cDo you know how to play \u2018LoL\u2019, Youyue Meimei?\u201d Zhao Hao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little bit.\u201d Zhao Youyue answered honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little bit is all it takes, when you wish to climb up the ranking, your big bro can ask for some professional player to carry you! You know that player named Guang Chang? The best jungling player in the whole server, one of the three big shots, I can summon him to assist you!\u201d Zhao Hao was showing off as usual, little did he know that the actual Guang Chang had become neither a dreamer nor a loser.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, big bro surely is amazing!\u201d Zhao Youyue was simply going along with it, in fact she did not have a single clue who this Guang Chang was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I love hearing it! Youyue Meimei, you\u2019re much easier to get along compared to Wanjun. Where do you wanna go during this year\u2019s summer holidays, I\u2019ll take you there with my dad\u2019s private jet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao proceeded to boot up his PC and launched \u201cLoL\u201d. While waiting for a matchup in ranking match, he opened up Baidu and search for \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d. He then started reading the pirated version of the novel.</p><br/><p>This was actually the first time Zhao Hao got addicted to reading a web novel. This novel was recommended by one of his teammates, he could not stop himself from reading such a masterpiece!</p><br/><p>He did not read the novel recently, so he was a few chapters behind. The readers\u2019 response was exceptional because the storyline was about Lin Feng meeting up with Yu Shengfan in real life, one of the long-awaited upsurge plots! As he could no longer wait to satisfy his urge of reading.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou own a private jet yet you\u2019re reading pirated novel!\u201d Zhao Youyue complained with a disgusted face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any difference? I always search on Baidu and clicked on the first result.\u201d Zhao Hao was confused. He was extremely embarrassed when he saw Zhao Youyue showing her face of despising someone for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the original web novels are at Qidian! You have to subscribe before you can read the latest chapter, it only costs ten cents per chapter! Big bro, are you that poor to read pirated novel instead of original?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 I really don\u2019t know.\u201d Zhao Hao was trying to find an excuse. In fact, he was aware of it, but he felt troublesome because he thought that there was no difference between them, same contents.</p><br/><p>To avoid being despised by Zhao Youyue, he created an account in Qidian following her instructions, with his ID named \u201cImYouyueHerBrother\u201d. He started to read the original novel, \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d for the first time.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue rolled her eyes upon seeing his ID, but she never uttered a word. She proceeded to brag to her cousin Zhao Hao, saying that she had rewarded a Silver Sect Master to the manga \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, which costs around 10,000 RMB and she was the first in the fan ranking for the novel too, with almost 500,000 fan points.</p><br/><p>After seeing \u201cYouyue\u201d at the first place in the fan ranking, he felt uneasy. This little cousin of his\u2026 Was she showing off her wealth in front of him? She had even mocked him for being poor, he was not going to tolerate this insult.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao could not stand to witness anyone showing off their wealth in front of him, not even Ding Yuncong, he would definitely counter them!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Silver Sect Master when there is a Golden Sect Master which costs 100,000 RMB? Just you wait, your big bro\u2019s gonna reward a Golden Sect Master, it\u2019s just 100,000 RMB!\u201d Zhao Hao was smiling confidently while topping up 200,000 RMB in his newly registered account. He saw the titles of Silver and Golden Sect Master were untaken in \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d novel, so he wanted to take them for himself.</p><br/><p>To Zhao Hao, the tip function was meant for him to show off. The money he tipped those female streamers on Douyu were more than millions, of course he had tasted the great relish of those female streamers as well. For only 100,000 RMB, he could secure his first fan ranking in these web novels, it was definitely cheap!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was surprised when Zhao Hao gave a tip of Silver Sect Master at first.</p><br/><p>With emotions surging, feeling regrets for not showing up earlier, even though a million was a large sum, it was still not enough to express my genuine feelings! \u201cImYouyueHerBrother\u201d has tipped \u201cRosemary\u201d 1,000,000 Qidian coins! The story was absolutely amazing! My friends and I were stunned! This is my one-million reward, keep striving dear author!</p><br/><p>When Zhao Hao saw his little cousin Zhao Youyue had not recovered from the shock, he was extremely excited, with his vanity going way over the chart. He then gave another Golden Sect Master without delay.</p><br/><p>Exciting contents infused with mixed feelings, hopefully this golden pen award would help master in his writing career!</p><br/><p>\u201cImYouyueHerBrother\u201d had tipped \u201cRosemary\u201d 10,000,000 Qidian coins! I am deeply moved at this moment! This book was so amusing that it made me speechless! Dude, it was absolutely marvellous!</p><br/><p>At this moment, both Qidian website and Qidian mobile app, had displayed a notice, \u201cImYouyueHerBrother\u201d huge amount of award, had caused a scene in Qidian today!</p><br/><p>Silver Sect Master was still pretty common in this prosperous era, 10,000 RMB no longer had its previous value in these days, but a Golden Sect Master was still very rare, because its value was 100,000! Despite of value inflation, it was still 100,000 RMB!</p><br/><p>Only a rich 2G like Zhao Hao could do it without any hesitation. He did not even care about the money value, as even his gaming equipment had cost him a few millions.</p><br/><p>As \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was fighting against ballot riggers in the Monthly Tickets Ranking, with the award of Golden Sect Master, it became the first on the Monthly Tickets Ranking!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhao Youyue was reminded by the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d that \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was already a \u201chigh popularity character card\u201d with a duration of three years if she decided to exit now! She would acquire that character card \u201ccharged\u201d up to ten years because the novel might turn into animation or even a live play!</p><br/><p>What choices would she make?</p>\n</div>"}

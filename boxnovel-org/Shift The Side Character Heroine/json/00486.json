The only thing that kept him going was instant noodles. His viewers could not deny that he was truly passionate about his games</p><br/><p>He was the first to start streaming this brand new Tale of Wuxia 3 DLC, and had not logged out even once. This also meant that he had the furthest progress thus far. His skills may be atrocious, but he fought through all those hurdles with sheer, dogged persistence. Bosses gave him pause, but only momentarily. Nothing had stopped him dead in his tracks, yet.</p><br/><p>In this game, mobs sometimes posed a greater threat than bosses. Wu Shun found himself repeatedly getting surrounded and mauled to death by numbers. It was depressing and embarrassing!</p><br/><p>His carelessness had once again led to him being surrounded by a bunch of poisonous desert scorpions. To make matters worse, these critters coordinated their attacks in near-perfect unison. They came in melee and ranged variations, and even knew how to flank and surround their enemies. They would even temporarily fall back whenever their HPs fell below a certain line, only to be replaced by healthier mobs</p><br/><p>These mobs were the ones to look out for whenever you roamed about in the outskirts of the Kingdom of Zhao. The Kingdom of Zhao was highly known for its many deserts. It gave the studio reason to produce majestic, awe-inspiring scenes. The capital of the Kingdom of Zhao was relatively prosperous, although it was still incomparable to those truly affluent countries within the base game.</p><br/><p>Wu Shun knew very well that his complacency had led to his latest predicament. His shell finally broke, and he almost turned into a weary, different person in the blink of an eye. He spoke feebly into the camera, \u201cI\u2019m so depressed. It looks like I\u2019m going to die again this time. These mobs are crazy, swarming upon you in no time. They\u2019re probably tougher to deal with than the boss. I just feel like giving up right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not only his spirit that was near breaking point. He had been playing the game for such a long duration. He had already waded, thigh-deep through various sidequests. He was physically exhausted as well. Many of the sidequest had also ended tragically. The darkness and heavy cloak of the world came upon him all at once, smothering him, the optimism and spirit that once held them back withering into dust.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had his moments of respite and reprieve as each boss finally went down. Even so, the loneliness and despair never truly went away. They piled up, choking the light out of his spirit. If his viewers had not consistently reminded him of their presence with their chain comments in the bullet curtain, he might have snapped altogether.</p><br/><p>At such a moment, the darkest night would only make the dimmest of lights dazzling. The game needed to throw him a bone for once</p><br/><p>He almost chuckled at that thought. This world was rutheless. It was filled with selfish, self-serving denizens. Even lowly peasants often attempted to scheme against paladins like him, for paladins were a necessary evil to them.</p><br/><p>The lawless world was big, yet it could provide no home for him.</p><br/><p>This often drove him into bouts of rage and disillusionment. He would sometimes vent it out by slaughtering entire villages.</p><br/><p>He had power of the world!</p><br/><p>Many games out there forced players to slaughter entire village, like \u201cThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\u201d Entire villages executed witch hunts on players for measly acts of pick-pocketing</p><br/><p>\u201cI bought the freaking game, I paid for it. Everything in it belongs to me. I can do whatever I want!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was precisely what Wu Shun throught. He plundered villages. After he had completely burnt down the entire village, slaughtered everyone and plundered everything within the village, he would say so to the audiences, further elaborating, \u201cThis is the essence of RPG games. You have to search every nook and cranny. What if there was some hidden plot to uncover?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026I\u2019m most definitely going to die this time\u2026look at the time, I\u2019ve reached the second day of streaming without even realizing it. I\u2019m thoroughly exhausted. With great shame, I\u2019ll have to end this stream. Everyone, please consider subscribing and sending some gifts over. I\u2019ve bared the heart and soul of the game to everyone here. It should be enough for you to know whether this DLC is worth buying. If you ask me, the game is definitely worth buying. In terms of the plotline and graphics, they are all top-notch and f*cked up as always. Wait, why is this DLC called \u201cThe Law of Humane Justice?\u201d In the past, I thought that the beautiful and gentle Yan Qingmeng would be a righteous, straight-lacecd chick, but right now, I\u2019m thinking that she\u2019s\u2026Huh? I\u2019ve already given up on healing, why am I still alive? What the f*ck. This game actually has good samaritans? Is this the so-called, legendary \u201cZha Feng\u2019s mercy\u201d?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Shun\u2019s drowsiness vanished. He saw an elegant female swordsman in grey clothes, with an incomparably beautiful sword dangling from her waist. Wu Shun almost started drooling when he saw the sword. It had to be some insane, extraordinary gear!</p><br/><p>The player in him reared its head. He really wanted to try killing the female swordsman, and see if she would drop that beautiful sword</p><br/><p>The scene that followed was equally beautiful. NPCs only got to flex and showcase their abilities when presented in CG cutscenes and the like. Anyone would look good in cinematic scenes. However, this mysterious NPC fought like a highly skilled player. There was none of that awkwardness or scripted movements of an NPC!</p><br/><p>Her sword techniques were beautiful and elegant. Even though she was fighting against a great number of poisonous desert scorpions, she flitted through their ranks like a graceful dancer, swinging her sword in seemingly casual fashion. The only problem was that the scorpions started leaking a great deal of vital fluids through gaps in their untouched armor as she passed them!</p><br/><p>Her technique aside, she had the evasive acuity of an elite player. She was actually side-stepping and tumbling like a player. She timed each of those moves by paper-thin margins, the attacks of her enemies passing through where she once had been a fraction of a second ago!</p><br/><p>\u201cTumbling about like a crazy donkey\u201d would never look pleasant, and can never be made any prettier, even through Wuxia lens. However, considering that this was just a game with some low-level martial art techniques, even the strongest top players would be unable to cast their superb \u2018flying skills.\u2019 At most, they could be considered rather adept parkour experts. The true elites knew how to use that one roll through an entire battle. With the right timing, they would get through boss fights unscathed. They were the ultimate one-horse ponies!</p><br/><p>Of course, NPCs would always present their trademark techniques in CG footage. Rolling like a donkey would be one of the few things an NPC wouldn\u2019t get caught dead doing. On the other hand, players only depended on drunk, random rolling. At least, they had a goal in mind \u2013 to roll away \u2013 drink some HP potions and recover their HP</p><br/><p>It was only a brief fight, but Wu Shun quickly confirmed that this NPC was incredibly skilled, even during actual fights. She was no CG-only entity. No matter how amazing some NPCs seemed to be in their CG appearances, the real thing would always be disappointing in contrast. As long as they possessed a HP bar, they could always be beaten down.</p><br/><p>There were no unique signs of the Samsara Palace on this grey-clad swordswoman. Otherwise, Wu Shun would have most certainly considered her as just another high-skilled player who came into his world for the Samsara Palace quest.</p><br/><p>The female swordsman had defeated a total of six poisonous desert scorpions. However, she had been wounded as she did not expect the scorpions to have a small probability of exploding in death</p><br/>\n</div>"}

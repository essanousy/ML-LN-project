She was sharp, precise and decisive. If she ever sat upon a throne, the world would be left in shock at the rapid development and pace of her kingdom.</p><br/><p>Now that her gorgeous sister had gone this far, why should she hold back anymore? She had never been a gentlewoman, and she was not going to start pretending to be one. Her blood decided to go wild!</p><br/><p>Cirilla touched her sister\u2019s face with one hand. She lifted the tip of her sister\u2019s hair. She took in the fragrance from her sister\u2019s soft long hair. It was truly intoxicating\u2026</p><br/><p>She finally stopped hesitating. She planted her lips on her sister\u2019s. Obviously, she was inexperienced. She was just sticking her own lips close to her sister\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>If two people were not truly in love, mere lip-to-lip would not trigger any sparks. Otherwise, their souls would actually resonate at supersonic speeds!</p><br/><p>Apparently, women were more concerned about emotions than men. When the right pair of souls come into contact with each other, it was spiritual, nuclear fusion!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Cirilla felt as if she was the happiest person in the world. Her complicated feelings towards her sister have finally been resolved. Her previous fears about loss and fear, all vanished at once!</p><br/><p>If she had to choose between her sister and grandmother, was there any more reason to doubt?</p><br/><p>She was not going to allow some jerk to lay hands on her sister!</p><br/><p>They were no longer just sisters. They were soul mates who would protect each other for the rest of their lives!</p><br/><p>Cirilla originally believed that soulmates were limited to conventional roles like husband and wife. If she had a choice in life, she would definitely be the superb and tall husband. She needed to take care of her sister, who was her most beloved wife. One day, she wanted to see her sister in a wedding dress\u2026</p><br/><p>At the next moment, her idea of \u201chusband and wife\u201d took another radical turn. Her sister-wife had initially allowed her to do whatever she wanted \u2013 but she no longer remained submissive. Clearly, she was dissatisfied with her lackluster kisses. Her sister\u2019s extremely beautiful eyes snapped open. There was a naughty, cunning flash, coupled with some affection within those bright eyes.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Lady Olivia Zhao was no nestling like Cirilla. Do not forget her time spent in \u201cPure Romance.\u201d She knew just how to please a girl\u2026</p><br/><p>She turned around and pushed her elder sister down, before climbing over her. Then, she merciless teased her elder sister\u2019s tongue, introducing her to the multi-layered pleasure of body and soul!</p><br/><p>Cirilla\u2019s entire face was steaming hot. Her beautiful, emerald eyes seemed to have been covered by a film of vapor. No one could ever expect the Heroic Spirit Cirilla to be utterly dominated by her own sister in bed!</p><br/><p>I wonder, who is the husband, and who is the wife?</p><br/><p>Olivia was the veteran!</p><br/><p>That night, Cirilla learned of the joys of the female body. Her skewed sexual orientation became outlined in certainty\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, she was just like a juvenile who had lost herself in love. She could do anything for her sister. Her sister was now her heart.</p><br/><p>When Cirilla woke up the next day, she found herself in a childlike position within Olivia\u2019s embrace. Her entire body had been enveloped in the fragrance of her sister\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Cirilla did not find the experience one bit unpleasant. But something was wrong. She should be the one hugging her sister, right?</p><br/><p>However, when she remembered how her sister had manipulated her body and elicited reactions and sounds that she never knew she had, her face started turning hot again. How embarrassing\u2026 but what a pleasant memory that was!</p><br/><p>Cirilla secretly swore that she would snatch back the initiative the next time. She had to exercise her position as the elder sister!</p><br/><p>Just as Cirilla grew complacent, Olivia woke up. Without saying anything, she pushed her elder sister down once again, and gave her a loveful morning kiss\u2026</p><br/><p>Cirilla had intended to push those invasive, pink lips away. Somehow, her hands lost their strength. Then, she became addicted to it, and lost herself in the pleasure. Anyone who had kissed before would know. The intoxication, the pleasure. The contact point between souls.</p><br/><p>Even after her sister got off the bed, she remained lying there in stunned silence, like a broken toy.</p><br/><p>When Cirilla finally regained consciousness, Olivia had already helped her into her clothes like an elder sister. Once again, Cirilla was struck dumb. Her sister had actually put women\u2019s clothing on her!</p><br/><p>She disliked women\u2019s clothing the most!</p><br/><p>Cirilla started to protest. But looking at her sister truly wanted to be \u201ca wife (husband) for the first time,\u201d she intended to pamper her sister. She should humor her.</p><br/><p>Olivia dressed Cirilla up nicely. The results were undoubtedly shocking. After all, Lady Zhao was most proficient at specific forms of \u2018sorcery.\u2019 She was always able to transform the people around her into handsome boys and beautiful girls, always reaching her impeccably high standards.</p><br/><p>Cirilla had the makings of a true beauty. She just did not know it yet. Olivia believed that one day, Cirilla would also become a stunning beauty. Since she wanted to become a female emperor, why not she just let her elder sister fill the position of the Queen?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, we still need to stay on the ship for a few more days. Just be my model. I\u2019d like to paint a picture of the current you!\u201d</p><br/><p>What could Cirilla do? She could only agree to her sister\u2019s requests. She loved her sister so much. She would never be able to let her little sister down.</p><br/><p>The two of them held hands and walked on deck to gaze at the scenery. Olivia told Cirilla about the story of \u201cTitanic.\u201d She even genderbent the male protagonist in the process. As a result, Cirilla was touched to the point of tears. She even recreated \u201cthat\u201d iconic pose with her sister \u2014\u2014 She spread her arms open and allowed her sister to hug her around the waist from behind\u2026</p><br/><p>These recent days have been far too blissful. She even doubted the reality of the situation. What if she was dreaming. What if she would wake, only to learn that her sister had already been married off to some sleazy stranger.</p><br/><p>When the ship finally arrived at the port of Cintra, Cirilla took hold of her sister\u2019s hand, and asked her solemnly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the relationship between us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The drama queen, Olivia came online. She pulled her hand away and replied evenly, \u201cWe\u2019re just sisters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cirilla\u2019s heart suddenly tesnsed up. She felt as if a scumbag had toyed with her body and heart\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to ask why I gave you my first kiss, it was actually just because you won the skating game against Hjalmar. There\u2019s no other meaning behind it,\u201d Olivia said, as if she truly meant it.</p><br/><p>Yet again, Cirilla was perplexed. Did this mean that if Hjalmar was the person who won, she would do the same thing to him as well?</p><br/><p>Cirilla had never been so mad in her life. However, she did not believe in her sister\u2019s nonsense. Would such minor mischief be the cause of such joy?</p><br/><p>She opened her mouth to say something again, only to realize that her maternal grandmother Queen Calathe was here to greet them in person.</p><br/><p>Cirilla suddenly understood what her sister actually meant.</p></div>\n</div>"}

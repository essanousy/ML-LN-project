It was the Mandarin version of the OP of \u201cBakus Kydai Let\u2019s &amp; Go!!\u201d. Parallel universes were interesting.</p><br/><p>She had not watched \u201cBakus Kydai Let\u2019s &amp; Go!!\u201d. However, this did not stop her from enjoying \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cBakus Kydai Let\u2019s &amp; Go!!\u201d was led by a pair of deuteragonists, while \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d was led by a protagonist Zhang Haolie. He was the combination of the deuteragonists in \u201cBakus Kydai Let\u2019s &amp; Go!!.\u201d This would be a Pseudo-Invincible styled[1] anime.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Zhang Haolie would never start a race smoothly. He would always fall behind at the start. However, just as Ultraman would only show his strength when his red light beeps, Zhang Haolie would only speed up during the later stages. This would be textbook shonen. The main character would always blow up with passion and claim victory with a bang.</p><br/><p>In reality, it sounded ridiculous, being able to egg a mini 4WD on by shouting, or to release the ultimate skill \u2018Victory Charge Tornado\u2019 by hollering out the skill name. Yet, it worked, every single time.</p><br/><p>Whenever Zhao Youyue saw the male protagonist\u2019s mini 4WD releasing its ultimate skill, her mind would freeze\u2014\u2014 how did this even work?</p><br/><p>This was the bane of all human intelligence!</p><br/><p>Yet, she had to admit that such a setting was very sensational. The male protagonist\u2019s cries would reach her and boil her blood, and she would sincerely hope for him \u2013 who would be brimming with positive energy \u2013 to win the competition.</p><br/><p>No wonder so many kids dug this anime. In fact, some works would not require any rationality at all. Once you look past the lack of logic, it did have its appeal. Such genre is similar to those \u2018killer sports\u2019 works. They took different approaches, but reaped equal results.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue remembered once watching an anime that was related to spinning tops. Those spinning tops would be able to summon divine beasts and carry on battling on another level. Wasn\u2019t that ridiculous? Not to the kids. They took it all in stride</p><br/><p>How boring would it be, if mini 4WDs, tops, and yo-yos in anime obediently followed the rules of reality.</p><br/><p>These anime have all been produced to sell the toys. They were all large-scale, feature-length advertisements.</p><br/><p>Now that \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d anime is being broadcasted to great effect, all mini 4WD models within the series are being highly demanded. Many kids believed that they would be just like the characters within the anime, releasing \u2018ultimate skills\u2019 and winning competitions.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s purpose of creating a female character this time was not to obtain any sort of ability, but to obtain a \u2018high popularity character card\u2019 as a consumable.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she did not need to apply a hack on herself, she was not here to create another Mary Sue character, such as the perfect goddess, \u2018Chu Luoxun.\u2019</p><br/><p>It would be best to stick to the storyline and obtain a high popularity character card.</p><br/><p>She chose to toss aside the idea of working for another iconic character. Disasters don\u2019t happen in tales for kids.</p><br/><p>Actually, something could be made out of it. \u201cEva\u201d was a good example. After the heroine died, her spirit possessed the male protagonist\u2019s racing car, becoming one with the machine. Even when the car runs out of battery, it would stir to live at the crucial moment, turning the tables upon the enemy, terrifying all who witness it!</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be fantastic?</p><br/><p>She could always work something out.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue did not want to die anymore. This piece of work was meant for kids. Let\u2019s spare them the grief and harshness of reality.</p><br/><p>She did not dare to cause random mess onto such an extremely popular work. If not, her destiny might be reversed, and that was not something funny.</p><br/><p>The male protagonist Zhang Haolie was extremely popular. The popularity of the work only served to boost his own popularity. He was just one step away from becoming an iconic character. Unfortunately, he was not a female. Or else, Zhao Youyue would be able to her first ever \u2018easy win.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, due to the explosive popularity of \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t be very difficult to create a highly popular female character. She had to be unique in her own way. She had to be formidable.</p><br/><p>This would depend on Zhao Youyue\u2019s own imagination. The more the better, without ruining the work.</p><br/><p>She only needed to possess a female character and conquer the invincible male protagonist once. That would be more than enough for the audience to remember her.</p><br/><p>However, she sensed that the scriptwriters of the original anime would never approve of such a plot. Ultraman would never be defeated by any monster. Even if he were to be defeated by one, that monster should probably be the ultimate monster which had been lurking about and built up with layer after layer of foreshadowing, not by a little monster that suddenly pops out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>If there are any flaws in this anime, it would be the fact that none of the female mini 4WD players had left a deep impression on the kids yet. The female players were mostly passerbys. Having a passerby defeat the male protagonist all of a sudden would make no sense.</p><br/><p>The scriptwriter would immediately notice the oddity, and dismiss the results of that \u2018intoxicated\u2019 state.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had even done some research on the anime\u2019s scriptwriter. His name was Tian Jun. This anime was his third mini 4WD-based work. His first two animes had obviously paved the way for this third one. It was also the best in all aspects, among all three animes.</p><br/><p>The third anime had even adopted a newer, updated art style. The anime would not have been as popular without it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue is always well-prepared when she resolves herself to take something seriously. She had not yet thought of any breakthrough ideas. Therefore, she chose to finish all the previous content first.</p><br/><p>She even entertained the thought of not even being a player, but as a competition commentator or a mini 4WD developer. However, the named female characters were all primary school students. They were the same age as the male protagonist Zhang Haolie. It made no sense for a primary female student to be a commentator or a researcher.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Zhao Youyue did not know the anime\u2019s scriptwriter. It would be very troublesome to get him to create an elder female side character. After all, this was a long-running anime. It was not so easy to add a new character out of the blue.</p><br/><p>Besides, the viewers have grown familiar with these primary female students with names. They had accumulated a degree popularity. She would just need to put in some effort and the female character would amaze the audiences!</p><br/><p>She zeroed in on a particular character. It would be a female mini 4WD player. Now, she had to find a way to make her stand out among the kids and receive her next high popularity card!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was currently out of ideas. Therefore, she bought a mini 4WD \u2018The Last Saber\u2019 model used by Zhang Haolie on her way to school that day. It was the second generation saber, similar to \u2018Victory Charge.\u2019 She started to assemble the mini 4WD excitedly during recess\u2026</p><br/><p>The class rep Bai Yunshan gazed over her shoulder angrily. \u201cThis Zhao Youyue is messing about again. Is she a primary student?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was already the middle of September. One of the more recent concerns in school was the coming Autumn Sports event. This was not good news for the Arts intensive class. They did not want to participate in the sports event. None of them were athletic. The last thing they would want is to take part in the scariest sports event \u2014\u2014 the 3,000-meter long run!</p><br/><p>That event would murder them!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Pseudo-Invincible style \u2013 It refers to anime that imitates the main character\u2019s style of being invincible.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

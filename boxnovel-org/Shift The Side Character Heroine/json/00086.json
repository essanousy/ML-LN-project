It was like fighting his boss Lin Feng, yet those endless heart-piercing chat bubbles did not allow him to calm down.</p><br/><p>He had actually stopped thinking about any sarcasm in those chat bubbles. Now, he could not help feeling that his opponent was indeed a crackerjack, who surpassed him in all aspects, that was why the opponent could PK him and type simultaneously\u2026</p><br/><p>This sole reason had utterly disheartened Tang Yongkai. He made a minor mistake, and Lin Feng heaved a sigh. Sure enough, this minor mistake of \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d was seized by \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, who then launched a smooth and magnificent combo attack upon him. He literally had no chance to fight back!</p><br/><p>Her sword moved like the wind. One could barely see the blade itself, but only the dazzling reflection from it.</p><br/><p>Just as the HP of \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d was low enough to be killed with a single blow, \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d stopped her movement. Her exquisite sword had returned to its scabbard too.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d the traumatized Tang Yongkai responded. Perhaps \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d did not have the heart to torture him further? Perhaps she was taking a pity on him?</p><br/><p>Many audience players were bewildered as well, and started speculating all kind of reasons. Some thought that \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d carried the love for talents, after all this \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d had indeed put up a longer defence and not yet exploded with rage. If it was any others, they might have gone up the wall and started yelling. It was like torturing an animal, so cruel!</p><br/><p>At the sight of the public chat, \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d instinctively sneered, \u201cWhat? Love for talents? Hahaha, his existence is merely to satisfy a variety of things, don\u2019t care about him, everyone. I\u2019m just too bored, and feel like torturing him 1 HP by 1 HP until he was dead without using a weapon. How do you guys feel? Interesting? Amusing? Amazing? Surprising? Happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as this sentence appeared above \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, who had kept her devastating famed sword in inventory and was ready to PK barehanded. All the audience players were reduced to silence, as a word flashed through their mind \u2013 Demon.</p><br/><p>This fellow was a downright demon. What bitter grudge did she hold against \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d? Why was she doing all of this to him?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone recalled that \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d was the one who started teasing \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, mocking people as a ladyboy fat otaku. So, \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d was bullied like this due to his own impudence. Did any otaku steal the rice in your family?</p><br/><p>Realizing the current situation, Tang Yongkai conceded defeat right away. He would have pulled off the internet cable but this was his boss\u2019 internet cafe, in which all the equipment were new yet the CPUs were locked, hence that was not possible\u2026</p><br/><p>On seeing the surrender of \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d, \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d immediately let out a \u201cTsk\u201d sound. Fortunate enough, she was playing in a private deluxe room. She was used to the most expensive items, including internet services. If she was playing in the regular hall and was recognized as \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, everyone would have beaten the daylights out of her no matter what sort of great beauty she was!</p><br/><p>In facts, some players had been watching the match behind Tang Yongkai all this while. Imagine a remarkable player in the new server was matched against \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, that would certainly be a spectacular PK. Not only that they must witness it, but they were looking to learn a thing or two from them.</p><br/><p>In the end, \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d was overpowered, beyond everyone\u2019s expectation. It had occurred to everyone that Tang Yongkai could at least stop the chat bubbles of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d and force her to fight with him to all of her abilities. But the truth was sickening!</p><br/><p>\u201cHoodlum Tang? Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you were tortured only once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big discrepancy between your equipment. Though the arena is already more balanced, but it can\u2019t be completely balanced\u2026 so don\u2019t give a hoot about it, Hoodlum Tang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget Hoodlum Tang, even \u2018Unpleasant Rain\u2019 had defeated you, but it could not change the reality that he is a ladyboy fat otaku, while you are the most handsome internet cafe manager!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a dishonorable player like \u2018Unpleasant Rain\u2019 should be tracked down and beaten to death someday. That fellow is way too arrogant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As everyone was actively comforting Tang Yongkai, he who had sunk into depression for just thirty seconds, again giggled optimistically. It was uncertain how many times he had been tortured by his boss Lin Feng, he had thus cultivated a sturdy heart, another trait of him that was appreciated by Lin Feng.</p><br/><p>Without a sturdy heart in a 5v5 team battle, one would not be able to perform in a downbeat battle [1]. Know that the team battle in \u201cEternal War\u201d is not as simple as PK, the character required growth during the early game to farm the unique items in \u201cEternal War\u201d, such as equipment, auras, etc.</p><br/><p>Even for the God of Tycoon players[2] who own superior equipment at the start, if they do not obtain a good amount of last hits for character growth in the early game, their total equipment would be surpassed in the late game. Hence, the rich Esports clubs always like to play with early-game strategy to rely on the advantages of superior equipment, while the small Esports clubs like to play with late-game strategy, their favorite quote \u2013 Play safe like a turtle and grow, don\u2019t rush.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The most powerful Esports teams would be those which are initially strong in early game, yet able to grow rapidly, thus become inconceivably powerful in late game. The \u201crifle king\u201d Zhou Zhelin was famous for her swift farming and strong laning. If she could be protected by the team from any sudden attackers like assassin, ninja or swordmistress until the late battle, basically the victory of team battle had been secured.</p><br/><p>Seeing the smile on Tang Yongkai\u2019s face, Lin Feng heaved a sigh of relief. He was afraid that Tang Yongkai would suffer a mental breakdown due to being tortured by \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d. Without a doubt, the PK prowess of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d was already considered as professional level, while Tang Yongkai\u2019s solo-battle skills were actually below his team-battle skills, so it was common for him to be crushed to pulp by \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d.</p><br/><p>Anyway, who is this \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d?</p><br/><p>Lin Feng was pretty sure that she was not a professional player, and definitely not a celebrity professional player. But her gaming skills were celebrity-level. He could not help searching for the name \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d in team battle scoreboard. To his utter surprise, this \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d had never played a team battle!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Feng\u2019s love for talents prickled. He could not wait to pull \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, this seemingly new person to his team.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In reality, Ye Hai was typing frantically. It was obvious that he had been writing in an intoxicated state. The words he wrote were more beautiful than what Zhao Youyue had experienced in the world of novel, especially the PK part in which \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d brought \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d to his knees. It was as if he had entered \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d and witnessed all of this on his own, not to mention that writing the game contents was his specialty. Imagine how surprised his wife Li Mengyao would be when he showed her this part of the story!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Downbeat battle() refers to the battle phase that is close to losing; upbeat battle () refers the battle phase that is close to winning</p><br/><p>[2] Play cowardly and grow, don\u2019t rush (,) \u2013 a quote from the game \u201cKing of Glory ()\u201d in China, means play safe in early-game, focus in farming and avoid any big team battles until the team has grown into a powerful shape.</p>\n</div>"}

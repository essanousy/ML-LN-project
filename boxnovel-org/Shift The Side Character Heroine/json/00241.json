Some readers who have been imagining themselves as the male protagonist Gu Yuan considered both Lin Meiyue and Chu Luoxun, the best girls among millions. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to get the three of them together?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Due to Han Leng\u2019s troublemaking, the two fan clubs went into all-out war, while another \u2018receive-all\u2019 gang emerged, quietly. The members of this gang first criticized the idea of monogamy. They considered the system as a shackle of love. True love should never be restricted to one on one. A man can have few women.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, these members were probably single dogs. They did not understand things at all. Having a woman in reality was more than enough for one to suffer, not to mention two.</p><br/><p>The two heroines Chu Luoxun and Lin Meiyue were just too perfect. Under Han Leng\u2019s intentionally ambiguous writings, the readers would easily envision an amicable love triangle[1]. Many research gangs emerged. The readers who started researching \u201cBeautiful April\u201d gradually increased. They even claimed themselves as researchers about \u2018aesthetics,\u2019 as if they were explicitly great.</p><br/><p>Alright. After the appearance of redology[2] and white study[3], there is this thing we call aesthetics.</p><br/><p>The plot thickened. Gu Yuan faced problems once again. An old problem came back to plague him, he was unable to start playing the piano.</p><br/><p>At this part, many readers could not help but complain. In the entire book, every time Gu Yuan wanted to play the piano, he would start feeling very uneasy, worrying about the mistakes that he would make. The readers were tired of such a situation.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan remembered Chu Luoxun, and her miracles.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked up. He spotted Lin Meiyue amongst the audiences, along with the others who had been continuously supporting him.</p><br/><p>Finally, he started playing. It was \u201cThe First Narrative Song\u201d by Chopin. It had great structure, magnificence, and powerful emotions.</p><br/><p>The moment he started playing, the two other contestants who have always been his rivals and friends were filled with awe. This was not just any connection, but a deep and calm reverberation.</p><br/><p>The judges were also filled with awe within their hearts. What a rich timbre.</p><br/><p>It was like a whisper. It was like a lover\u2019s embrace. Chopin\u2019s narrative song was played in a gentle, yet sorrowful tone.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan reached deep, and found his utmost peak!</p><br/><p>He ended up \u2018summoning\u2019 the cherry tree at the beginning. The sky was filled with cherry blossoms, dancing around his piano. All of that was the exemplification of his music. Within literature, it was a must to show everything through such powerful imagery.</p><br/><p>However, this was just the beginning. The real climax had yet to come!</p><br/><p>As Gu Yuan performed with all his soul, the medical apparatus in Chu Luoxun\u2019s surgery theater beeped away</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan remembered carrying Chu Luoxun back to her ward, and she spoke in his ear\u2014\u2014Thank you.</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes, continuously chanting within his heart and conveying to Chu Luoxun. When he opened his eyes again, he was in a blue sky with his piano!</p><br/><p>The sky was blue. The white clouds drifted by. The snowflakes fell. The ground was also blue, reflecting the color of the sky. It was pure and moving\u2026</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan turned his head slightly, and saw a terrifying scene. A beautiful, ethereal figure had stepped into this beautiful, blue musical world. She was wearing a white dress, a violin in her hands. Her translucent figure eventually solidified. She turned back and looked at him with a smile on her face.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan almost burst into tears. Was her soul already living within his music?</p><br/><p>This is the second ensemble between Gu Yuan and Chu Luoxun within the entire novel. Of course, the audiences would never be able to witness it. Gu Yuan alone heard the sound of her violin. It was as beautiful as ever</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan closed his eyes once more. Fighting back his tears, he immersed everything into the sound of his piano.</p><br/><p>However, he could still hear the sound of Chu Luoxun\u2019s violin, joyful, playful, bearing no respect or regard for the original score. He opened his eyes once more. She was still smiling at him. She was dancing. Her movements were agile and full of life.</p><br/><p>Every time she played a note with her violin, a ray of dazzling light broke through the clouds.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan looked at her. He remembered the past her, at the peak of her life. He closed his eyes peacefully, as if he was simply going to bed, after a long day. It felt so good to have her beside him.</p><br/><p>However, when he opened his eyes once more, she had stopped playing. She was still smiling, but there was a sense of defeat in her smile. Her figure started to turn transparent</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026Don\u2019t leave! We can just be friends! Don\u2019t leave, don\u2019t leave, don\u2019t leave, don\u2019t you leave me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of Gu Yuan\u2019s piano suddenly became very rapid, as if he was trying to keep her in this realm. However, her body only shone with a dazzling light, eventually turning into countless pieces of cherry blossom petals!</p><br/><p>The moment her face disappeared, her tears finally dropped. She wanted to stay</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan\u2019s piano performance was finally coming to an end. He returned from the musical realm, back to the stage in reality.</p><br/><p>The moment he pressed the last note, he burst into tears\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cFarewell,\u201d said Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>It has come to an end.</p><br/><p>Han Leng wrote this portion in an \u2018intoxicated\u2019 state, with every sentence, every word, every syllable written to perfection!</p><br/><p>Words can never describe the power of words!</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan\u2019s piano performance was a great success. This piece turned him into a well-known, young pianist throughout the country.</p><br/><p>However, Chu Luoxun\u2019s surgery failed. She never left the operating theater.</p><br/><p>She gave her violin to Lin Meiyue, together with the countless songs that she had composed, so that Lin Meiyue could keep the title \u2018Genius Composer\u2019 forever. This way, she would be able to stand beside Gu Yuan, the genius pianist.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun only gave Gu Yuan the childhood photo and the song \u201cHappened to Meet You\u201d. As for whether she ever liked Gu Yuan, it was not clearly stated in the novel.</p><br/><p>However, those \u2018aestheticians\u2019 could choose to delve into the lyrics\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>We\u2019re crying</p><br/><p>We\u2019re laughing</p><br/><p>We look up to the sky</p><br/><p>The stars are still shining</p><br/><p>We\u2019re singing</p><br/><p>The song of time</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Because I just happened to have met you</p><br/><p>And leave behind a ten-year-wish</p><br/><p>If we meet again</p><br/><p>I think that I will remember you</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>April is truly beautiful. It is coming. The month of April where we will meet you is coming. The month of April without you is coming.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue laid flowers on Chu Luoxun\u2019s gravestone. Then, they held each other\u2019s hands and left.</p><br/><p>The lovers got married. Such a happy ending!</p><br/><p>The end!</p><br/><p>At first, the readers thought that \u201cBeautiful April\u201d referred to \u2018Lin Meiyue.\u2019 After all, her name was in the title. The initial development had met the readers\u2019 expectations. However, no one expected it to be the most beautiful month of April with Chu Luoxun in it!</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun ended up leaving the scene as the heroine.</p><br/><p>Without Chu Luoxun\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>April will never be beautiful anymore. Beautiful April is a lie.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Love triangle \u2013 It refers to the love relationship between three persons. For example, if A is a boy, B and C are girls.

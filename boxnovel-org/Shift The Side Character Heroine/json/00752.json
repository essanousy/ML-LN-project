Can entertainment ever be iconic? It\u2019s niche, commercialized, and stale, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>In reality, entertainment works were never-ending. In it, some iconic works were immortalized with neverending praises over the generations. Of course, there was also highly popular works. For one, take a look at the smash hit, \u201cI\u2019m Really a Superstar\u201d [1]. Its author became a Platinum High God from that one series.</p><br/><p>There was also the super-popular manga \u201cBakuman.\u201d It definitely fell within the category. This manga followed the story about a group of mangaka drawing manga, competing with each other. A similar comparison could be made with the monthly ticketing war in the Qidian novel website. The latter was not that authoritative, because of various reasons that we already know. However, the various rankings in \u201cBakuman\u201d were adrenaline inducing. It certainly depicted the emotions of fighting for a dream\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was a little speechless. What was she supposed to do here? Compete with the creators in the Source World for rankings?</p><br/><p>As she rearranged her thoughts, she realized that this world might just be the ideal cash cow! After all, she had just started a publishing company in the real world, and so, was always lacking in outstanding creators. Outstanding creators were a form of high-quality resource. Everyone basically fought over them. Her small company had only been able to pull in outstanding creators like Su Li and Han Leng, all thanks to her personal relationships.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was precisely for this reason that she would have to give them the best conditions out there. If not, they would grow to resent her, no matter how close they were.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue would never be stingy like that. She would not go so low as to exploit Su Li and Han Leng just to earn more money. She hoped that they could create classic works and flesh out new iconic female protagonists for her to pick up and win in a breeze\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had always believed that a character card was more important, compared to a bucket load of money.</p><br/><p>The resources in Zhao Youyue\u2019s company were limited. With big generals like Su Li and Han Leng, there was nothing much left to go around. The rest would be used on maintaining \u201cAltair\u2019s\u201d popularity, so that it would always be recognized. Then, it could remain as the most popular Doujinshi character out there. Altair would also appear in all forms of Doujinshi novels and Endless-type novels. It might be a passerby big boss, or a talented onlooker minding his own business. Anyways, many Doujinshi writers loved pulling her out to join in on the fun, so that Altair\u2019s fans could be happy. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to cheese some points and tips?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had been at a loss for a period of time. The \u201crecords\u201d that she obtained from making trouble in the Source World and from Su Li and Han Leng did not help in the expansion of her company. These included the horror film that she had obtained from the previous Supernatural Source World and the CG animation obtained from the \u201cWitcher\u201d series gaming Source World\u2026</p><br/><p>If her company did not have enough capital, she might not be able to monopolize the biggest benefits from the dark technology she had researched. This was an era where capital was the King. Many talented entrepreneurs were only working for more capital.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had never thought about establishing a cultural Empire, but now that she was in this entertainment-type Source World, it was practically free lunch from the sky!</p><br/><p>There was a relatively balls to the sand [2] hindrance in the entertainment-type source world. Even though its\u2019 development of science and technology was very advanced, it was, however, lacking in cultural development. In such a situation, plagiarists from other parallel worlds, or in other words, the main protagonists with the \u201cSuperstar System,\u201d could reap the benefits\u2026</p><br/><p>To Zhao Youyue, this would be particularly useful. She could fully display the abilities of the character card of \u201cZhang Yanwei\u201d in this Source World that would never limit the abilities of the card. She wanted to see if she could come up with some groundbreaking technology.</p><br/><p>Such an opportunity might just present itself. A group of main protagonist plagiarists might do their bit to help develop the cultural industry in this entertainment Source World. Zhao Youyue, the mad scientist who was obsessed with climbing the technology tree had already started her journey to the sea and stars.</p><br/><p>Of course, if there was an opportunity, Zhao Youyue was very interested in researching those main protagonist plagiarists\u2026</p><br/><p>This time, when Zhao Youyue descended into the Source World, she would have full control over her abilities and identity. It was an otaku cutie high school student named Yuan Shawu. She also had a brother she truly doted on. His name was Yuan Zhenzhong. He was already in university, and he was a light novel author.</p><br/><p>However, it was quite obvious that Yuan Zhenzhong had no particularly outstanding talents in terms of his creativity, or in other words, the golden finger. This only made him a second-rate light novel author. The money he earned from his novels was used to support himself and his sister. That was already quite impressive for a second-year university student\u2026</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not even mention about this light novelist\u2019s previous failures. He did find some success with \u201cMy Sister Is Just So Cute.\u201d God, what a siscon\u2026</p><br/><p>But let it be known that novels do not directly reflect the personalities of their authors. For example, many light novel authors had no sisters, but they still wrote a lot of siscon novels which are forever popular. The problem here was that this Yuan Zhengzhong did have a sister, and this sister is actually \u2018just so cute.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was right. Why would Zhao Youyue ever possess anything less than beautiful?</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao, as an appearance con [3], not only had high requirements for other people\u2019s appearance, her requirements for her own appearances would be sky-high. Therefore, her possessed had to be amazingly beautiful. Most of them were beautiful teenagers, until her last addition.</p><br/><p>Descending into a Source World was not like a literary world where she could choose a female character as she liked. In that case, Zhao Youyue was determined to choose the better-looking character. Be it the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d or the Altair God character card, Lady Zhao was an appearance con before she was an artist, composer or scientist. Apart from their identity and background, all three of Zhao Youyue\u2019s characters in the Source world were beautiful chicks!</p><br/><p>Even though Yuan Shawu was an otaku high schooler who did not know how to dress up, she had the necessary basics down. If, at her core, was a Lady Zhao, one could only imagine the ruckus she could stir up in this entertainment Source World!</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cI\u2019m Really a Superstar\u201d () is a novel written by Chang Yu.</p><br/><p>[2] \u201cBallache\u201d () is a term which describes a feeling of helplessness, confusion, and agitation which leads to a person feeling uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>[3] \u201cAppearance con\u201d () \u201c\u201d here means \u201clooks,\u201d and \u201c,\u201d which originates in Japanese, is the transliteration of the English word \u201ccomplex.\u201d \u201c\u201d is often added after a noun to form a phrase, which means \u201cbeing attracted to and obsessed with.\u201d Therefore, this term refers to those people who are obsessed with good looks.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

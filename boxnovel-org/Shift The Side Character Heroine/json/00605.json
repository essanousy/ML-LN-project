He had been driving for years now, yet he was nothing compared to his own sister. He resignedly accepted the fact.</p><br/><p>His sister did not even slow down at the bends, but she did not gas it on the straights either. She lacked the daredevilry of an actual racer.</p><br/><p>She may have her own reasons for maintaining such a steady speed. Regardless, races only cared about one thing \u2013 speed. If consistency won races instead, everyone could do it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao started off with his history with Chen Yilong, eventually concluding with how they got down to the gamble that led to this. He went on to mention that nobody should even think of racing Chen Yilong\u2019s boyfriend, \u201cXia Hai\u201d if they do not even go past 100km/h down Mount Qilin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao had no problems going slightly over 200km/h on an empty straight and absolutely no traffic. That was all the adrenaline he needed. Even with the slightest traffic, he would struggle to go past 140km/h.</p><br/><p>After all, real life driving was nothing like racing sims. If you don\u2019t touch 300km/h on sims, what\u2019s the use of calling it a sim?</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, these sims have never succeeded at their goal \u2013 to simulate real-life driving situations. They could never reproduce every racing variable. Of course, one might also learn by watching races on television, but it was nothing like the experience when watching a race in person.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat \u201cXia Hai\u201d has some potential! I thought that the Mount Qilin racing god could beat him \u2013 I even invested a huge sum in car upgrades for him. It evened the odds on their cars, but he still lost by a mile! How disappointing! How embarrassing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao had been rather confident in the Racing God even though his car could not be compared to Xia Hai\u2019s. That man had such a doting boyfriend \u2013 a descendant of the God of gambling. Who knows what expensive secrets lay beneath the hood of his car. Such unofficial races were at times, dependent on the car\u2019s specs.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the Mount Qilin Racing God already had a number of wins on Mount Qilin. He knew the track like the back of his hand. Even so, he still lost to Xia Hai.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao and Chen Yilong had watched the stream together. Xia Hai had been incredibly lucky to leech off Chen Yilong. He was a decent driver and had a considerable amount of courage. He did not throw his car about with flamboyant power slides \u2013 but he won nevertheless.</p><br/><p>In the world of racing, the one who crosses the finish line first wins. Who cares if you had a massive lead at the earlier half?</p><br/><p>Of course, if you could drift your car beautifully while still pulling out ahead of your opponent, you would gain a lot of fans, but not many could do both at the same time. They only pulled off such stunts for show \u2013 their variations of the stunt served no purpose in actual races. If they attempted it during a serious race, it would only slow them down.</p><br/><p>It was just another sport, like basketball and soccer. Players could perform some fancy stunts to entertain the crowd, but at the end of the day, speed won most of the time.</p><br/><p>Xia Hai was the epitome of, \u201cthe wielder of a sword determines the sharpness of the sword.\u201d He could make a good anime villain. He would not be eligible as the main protagonist, as he was a little lacking in the appearances department. Driving was one thing, good looks was another.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying, sister Youmei, is that if you can\u2019t do any of those stunts from the anime, you won\u2019t even have the slightest chance of winning! That bastard Xia Hai has already beaten the racing god of Qilin. He had even set a new record in the process! I\u2019m telling you, he will be the first to overcome every single mountain road in the world!\u201d Zhao Hao recalled the nightmare of being utterly beaten on that day.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what a coincidence! I do know the stunts from the anime! The \u201cCrow of the Planes\u201d from \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d is no longer fiction, I\u2019ve brought it to reality!\u201d Zhao Youyue said while smiling.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao rolled his eyes. He could only humor her, she was the one behind the wheel. No racing would happen today, they were just there to meet. If they were to actually compete, his sister would be decimated. Xia Hai was not just a pro racer, he was already familiar with the road, but his sister was here for the first time.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao had no doubts about Zhao Youyue\u2019s genius. If anything, he would be surprised to find her bad at something. Even so, it would be a stretch to say that she could defeat Xia Hai.</p><br/><p>When the both of them reached the starting point of Mount Qilin Racing Route, it was already dark, but there were still many racers around. Some were here to challenge Xia Hai, the man who had just toppled the racing god of Mount Qilin, while others were simply there to watch or gamble.</p><br/><p>Some racers put on their billionaire\u2019s faces. Some had choppered up the mountain with their rumbling Harley-Davidsons. Others were here for fun. Some drunks even got up the Mountain on their scooters.</p><br/><p>Other than that, a reporter called \u201cMiss Jiazi\u201d was present. She was, in fact, a reporter for an outdoors activities streaming channel. She was handsomely paid and had grown rather rich, but was rather frugal for a missy. Clearly, she still cared about her job and its pay.</p><br/><p>Miss Jiazi\u2019s full name was Qian Xiaojia. Her family was rather powerful, although it was nothing compared to the Zhao family. At that moment, she was speaking to her viewers, \u201cPreviously on our stream, we gave you guys first seat views of the race between \u201cHeavenly King Xia Hai\u201d and \u201cRacing God of Mount Qilin.\u201d I bet that the rush has not yet worn off yet. As of now, Xia Hai is the reigning king of Mount Qilin. We hope to see someone challenging him tonight, although I doubt such a person even exists. \u201cThe Racing God of Mount Qilin\u201d had been thought to be undefeatable, so what about Xia Hai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Jiazi had already started off as a somewhat popular streamer. Her choice of content only further increased her reputation even further since mountain racing doesn\u2019t often appear in real life, mostly only in animations and films.</p><br/><p>As Qian Xiaojia blabbered on about Xia Hai, the audiences became awfully excited. She was right. The King of the Heavens, Xia Hai had already broken so many records. He had been born to drive on Mount Qilin.</p></div>\n</div>"}

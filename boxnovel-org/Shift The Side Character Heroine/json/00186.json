It had increased the popularity of this work. This indicated that her presence was meaningful for this entire piece of work.</p><br/><p>As for the matter of many readers worrying that \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d would replace Lin Meiyue, Zhao Youyue expressed that there is nothing to be worried about. How could a dead person replace her? The relationship between the main characters would be most stable!</p><br/><p>Moreover, Zhao Youyue had got the reassurance from Leng Zi. How could it be possible for Leng Zi, a cute female author, to copy the bad examples of Rosemary?</p><br/><p>Leng Zi would never cheat the readers!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue showed that she believed in Leng Zi. She even kept saying to Leng Zi that she supported only Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue as a couple, but she liked \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d too, and that she must not reduce her scene no matter what, and that she had to showcase more of her talents in music</p><br/><p>Leng Zi was confused by Zhao Youyue. He did not understand why Zhao Youyue strongly supported the couple, yet not allow him to reduce the scenes of \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Much contradiction, right?</p><br/><p>The heroine\u2019s sense of presence was already weak, to begin with, and now came the eye-catching \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Apparently, she was a significant threat to her, and she was even threatening to blot out the male protagonist\u2019s role!</p><br/><p>After seeing the first ensemble of Gu Yuan and Chu Luoxun at the musical competition, many of the trouble-making readers had shouted excitedly \u2013 \u201cthey are together now.\u201d They did not bother about the fact that Lin Meiyue was the first one. After all, they had not yet confirmed their relationship</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Han Leng took Zhao Youyue\u2019s opinion seriously, as usual, and he began to write accordingly, throwing more dog food between Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue and sprinkling out more scenes of correspondence between him and \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d in music, simultaneously. Both should be held on to, with neither aspect neglected!</p><br/><p>He took Zhao Youyue seriously, not because he still liked her, but because she was the number one fan of his book.</p><br/><p>Why is she being described as the number one fan?</p><br/><p>This is because she did not only support the author financially but also sincerely promoted the book in class. She even hoped that those readers who liked this work would submit the reader survey form to push \u201cBeautiful April\u201d up the ranks.</p><br/><p>These magazines took the survey form rankings seriously. They will stop the publication of the lower ranking works. The previous issue of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d ranked the first as it deserved which made Leng Zi, the newbie author became the boss of \u201cMengya\u201d contracted authors.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue even kept posting comments about the \u201cBeautiful April\u201d on Weibo. None of them failed to emphasize on how much she loved the story.</p><br/><p>Through this, her Weibo finally achieved the \u201cBig V\u201d status. Actually, it was a walk in the park for her, as having thousands of fans was already sufficient. On top of that, there were many genuine Qidian authors among her fans, and this naturally would let them solidify her status. Hence, her Weibo became a \u201cBig V.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, her influential power was still limited, only holding sway over Qidian readers, and yet, many of them started reading this juvenile novel because of her. They praised it after reading it, naturally, as such a refreshing and realistic juvenile novel is rare. The musical passages carried such depth, which made it stand out even more.</p><br/><p>Honestly, it was a great thing to have a reader like Zhao Youyue. However, Han Leng had become afraid of revealing the true identity of \u201cLeng Zi.\u201d He regretted starting off under such a disguise in the first place, feeling that he could not regain his integrity anymore. If he does reveal himself, Zhao Youyue would see him as a pervert, right?</p><br/><p>Han Leng, a pervert author who would be mocked, posing as a female. Since he is so good at using the voice changer, he must be a closet cross-dresser as well. Apparently, Leng Zi was not a female author, but a Lady boss!</p><br/><p>Admittedly, it touched him to see that Zhao Youyue was enthusiastically promoting his book and was even asking everyone to submit the survey forms. She had voluntarily chosen to do so, as she really liked it. Thus, she had put in a considerable amount of effort in promoting it</p><br/><p>Han Leng did not know that the more popular the book gets, the more useful it would be for her. He really thought that Zhao Youyue was a perfect reader selfless, passionate, and without ulterior motives, and that he was lucky to have such a reader!</p><br/><p>The former Han Leng would have fallen for her even more, due to her behavior, thinking how nice she was and that she should be a major fangirl of the author, seeing that she liked the book so much!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, everything was different now. Han Leng noticed that she was not as attractive as before, not because Chen Haoran, his bestie, liked Zhao Youyue too, but he discovered that he now knew the perfect girl, he is writing about \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t forget, in his \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d Lin Meiyue; the heroine was written in accordance with the archetype of Zhao Youyue. He had more feelings when he began to write \u201cLin Meiyue\u201d to fulfil his regrets in reality, but, after the appearance of \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d he found only found the former to be petty and tedious!</p><br/><p>This made him miserable, yet helped him learn more about himself, to know that his former preference was so fickle and artificial. Initially, he was so confident that nobody would like her more than him. Because of this, he wrote the turbulence in his heart into the novel</p><br/><p>However, his so-called deep love would not last long!</p><br/><p>The more Zhao Youyue did for his work, the more ashamed he would be to face her. He felt that he was a super scumbag, an unfaithful lover. She treated him and his work seriously, yet, he was afraid to say that his most favored character now was \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d</p><br/><p>As a creator, it was normal to be obsessed with the character who set off the explosion of inspiration. Moreover, for Han Leng, an author who was in the age of puberty \u2013 a very superstitious age \u2013 having the Adolescent delusion would be on a crazier level than the Rosemary, uncle level author!</p><br/><p>Anyhow, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had replaced Lin Meiyue, becoming the female character that he is madly in love with. It even made him neglect his former crush in reality</p>\n</div>"}

Ming the Scumbag can die, but Xu Jing must live on \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave group! Leave group! Leave group!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScr*w you, Master Su! This finale gave me nightmares, and thanks to you, I\u2019m totally depressed! Now, pay for my loss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you be so cruel? Ever since my goddess turned from a side character to a supporting character and have gotten her background settings, everything became terribly dreadful and miserable. From the beginning, I really thought that she and Yang Xixi would be together with full happiness. I had never thought that Yang Xixi would be same like her brother, taking my goddess as a friend of benefits. In the end, she brought along her brother\u2019s head and disappeared along with a nice boat, taking away the will of living from my beloved goddess Xu Jing. It seems true that only studying would never betray Xu Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The group was filled with condemnation. At this moment, to make her entrance more appealing, Zhao Youyue distributed 1,000 RMB worth of slogan red packets[1] in the group straight away. The slogan inscribed was \u2013 I\u2019ve never met such a shameless person!</p><br/><p>There were 50 packets in total, averagely 20 RMB per person. This was like a meal worth of money. This time, the slogan immediately flooded the entire screen of the group!</p><br/><p>When Su Li discovered it was her Number One Sect Master\u2019s red packets, she did not even bother whether the slogan was against her. She too shamelessly shared the slogan and successfully grabbed 50 bucks, as if she was proving the slogan right. Her red packet was far above average, and this instantly cheered her up.</p><br/><p>What was a Number One Sect Master?</p><br/><p>Of course it was a Sect Master who was placed first in the fan ranking. Her fan points were over 500,000 points, equivalent to tipping over 5,000 RMB. Su Li surely would have opted to compromise such a true tyrant reader. Besides, the red packets distributed by \u201cYouyue\u201d in the group were at least 100 RMB per distribution. That was why when Su Li noticed the red packet of this tycoon, she grabbed it without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, this time it was a 1,000 RMB gigantic red packet!</p><br/><p>The group was filled with the voices of worshipping \u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Youyue the God of Tycoons, now I have money for my supper!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a blessing to be in the same group with Tycoon Youyue. I was planning to leave the group, but for Tycoon Youyue, I decided to stay here shamelessly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, God of Tycoons. Damn! This is the first time I grabbed such a huge red packet\u2026 I\u2019m thrilled!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you lacking of leg accessories, Tycoon Youyue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess what I saw just now? How dare you grab the red packet of Tycoon Youyue, Su Li the liar! You are totally shameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, God of Tycoons! Also, did I remember that someone promised not to trick the Sect Masters in the beginning? And now? Lol\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTycoon Youyue, it\u2019s best not to read Su Li, the King of Toxic\u2019s new work. You will end up getting tricked again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMissed it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMissed it +10086!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After seeing the fans persuading \u201cYouyue\u201d not to read her new works, Su Li had the urge to kick the troublemakers out of the group. Anyway, she needed to hold \u201cYouyue\u201d tight as she was not just a plain tycoon. By just looking at her Qidian account, she had at least tipped seven titles or thereabouts. Not only Sect Master, but of course she had a lot of titles such as Court master[2] or Coxswain[3]. To her, 100 RMB was just like 1 RMB, she could simply tip them away. It was truly the style of a tycoon. Although she could not be comparable to those super tycoons who could tip millions to some broadcasters, but in the Qidian novel and manga section, Youyue was already considered godly. Nowadays, it was pretty hard to find such tycoons who loved novels and manga-s.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, for Su Li, the highest tip from \u201cYouyue\u201d was for \u201cPure Romance\u201d. In other words, she was the favourite amongst them. Now that she had created such a finale, she was really worried that \u201cYouyue\u201d would leave the group in a fit of anger and would never read any of her works again.</p><br/><p>Regarding \u201cYouyue\u2019s\u201d gender, the God of Tycoons, it was actually a mystery to everyone. Simply because both her Qidian accounts and QQ info were set as female, and her nicknames seemed pretty feminine. Including Su Li, plenty believed that \u201cYouyue\u201d should be a male. After all, why would a girl read such a manga like \u201cPure Romance\u201d? Not to mention tipping a buttload of money.</p><br/><p>But\u2026.Who would ever imagine that Zhao Youyue actually did not favor \u201cPure Romance\u201d that much. Anyhow, \u201cPure Romance\u201d did help her a lot. Besides, she successfully grabbed hold of the iconic character card \u201cXu Jing\u201d in the end. Although she frequently said that the finale of \u201cPure Romance\u201d had nothing to do with her, but for someone as warm-hearted as her, she would still have the thought of compensating Su Li. Fortunately, what she had the most was money. A few thousand RMB was like a couple of bucks to her, she could just tip them to Su Li. After all, Su Li was considered a beauty. As for Zhao Youyue, people with outlooks and talents were admirable, regardless of their gender.</p><br/><p>That was why if Su Li was actually a wretched ugly middle-aged guy, she would not have treated him with kindness, not to mention that the early stage of \u201cPure Romance\u201d had brought up so much bad impressions. If possible, Zhao Youyue did not want to enter such illogical harem-based title. She could only skate on thin ice to make this kind of title into a \u201clegendary masterpiece\u201d. Contents like cleaver or nice boat could not be used twice.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Su Li was really afraid that \u201cYouyue\u201d would leave the group. Unhesitantly, she promoted \u201cYouyue\u201d to the group admin and also added \u201cYouyue\u201d as her friend. She believed if \u201cYouyue\u201d was a male reader, he should already be attracted to a pretty mangaka like her now. She decided to send some of her portrait photos to \u201cYouyue\u201d as the additional benefits. Know that she was quite confident in her face and figure\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this was Su Li. She had nearly no resistance to the tycoon readers. She would never accept bloody words like \u201cWhat reader? I\u2019m your dad\u201d.</p><br/><p>All along, she treated the readers as her lifeline. Readers are Gods!</p><br/><p>Just as Su Li grabbed a 50 RMB red packet and thanked \u201cYouyue\u201d the God of Tycoons shamelessly, she saw \u201cYouyue\u2019s\u201d reply. \u201cOriginally, this 1,000 RMB was to be the tip for \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 to commemorate its ending. But after reading the finale, I decided to distribute them in the group, giving it to everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>After her words was spreaded, fans in the group bursted with joy. They either replied \u201cGood job\u201d or posted some stickers with big smiles. It was obvious that this Tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d was teasing Su Li and clearly they loved to see that. Now, there was this trend of throwing muds at Su Li in the group. However, this act of throwing muds was out of good intentions. The fans who truly could not accept the finale of \u201cPure Romance\u201d had left the group a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Seeing the reply from \u201cYouyue\u201d, although knowing that she was just making a joke, it still prickled Su Li\u2019s heart. Sigh, why is this society so cruel?</p><br/><p>Just as this thought bloomed in Su Li\u2019s mind, Zhao Youyue smirked \u201cdemonically\u201d and tossed all the screenshots of the dark histories from her phone to the group\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1]  \u2013 Slogan red packet \u2013 QQ Slogan red packet is a function opened for QQ friends and QQ groups.

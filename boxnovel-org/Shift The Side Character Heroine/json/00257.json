No, Master Leng Zi, to be frank. Her eyes glimmered. She has just given birth to a great evil!</p><br/><p>He was wearing a high school girl uniform which belonged to the 2D world. His straight long slender legs were covered by a layer of black silk knee socks. An absolutely white and smooth surface was exposed at the void between where the short skirt ended and knee socks began. No one will ever feel tired of playing with such a beautiful pair of legs!</p><br/><p>The only unfortunate part was that his chest was too flat. So what? His cute face and slender legs would still lure men into the ultimate trap!</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat gifted scholar Han, I mean\u2026Master Leng Zi, I certainly did not expect you to turn out so cute! Your fans will be thrilled!\u201d said Zhao Youyue happily.</p><br/><p>She circled him a few times, surveying her work. She took out her handphone and snapped pictures of him from different angles. Unfortunately, she did not bring along a single-lens reflex camera. It could have captured the images with life-like quality. With some editing, this Han Leng would turn into a Goddess for the otakus!</p><br/><p>Han Leng stood on the spot nervously. Cross-dressing was most certainly a private affair. The last thing you would want happening is to get exposed. Yet here he was, being scrutinized from head to toe by Lady Zhao. He felt so shy, yet excited\u2026</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao\u2019s beautiful appearance seemed to suddenly turn mundane and mediocre. It was Han Leng\u2019s almighty ego speaking once again. He thought that the prettiest person in this world should be him in drag, Leng Zi, not Han Leng.</p><br/><p>This is Han Leng, forever, changing his mind. Sometimes extremely arrogant, sometimes his harshest critic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, I always see statements from other male writers, saying they\u2019d rather die than cross-dressing. Some would be deep in debt, yet they would refuse to pay up by dressing in drag. How foolish! Such writers deserve to stay penniless! I think it\u2019s time to put some pressure on them. I\u2019ll take a cross-dressing selfie for each holiday and festival, and have my readers share them to other readers\u2019 groups. I feel so excited just imagining it!\u201d said Han Leng proudly.</p><br/><p>No one knows since when, but there is this common practice among social groups of books, where the groups\u2019 hosts would be asked to cross-dress. Han Leng used to ignore these requests. But now, his cross-dress photos were definitely qualified to be shared to other groups, with the intent of putting pressure on the other groups\u2019 hosts!</p><br/><p>Han Leng realized that he was not against cross-dressing at all, without getting addicted to it. He was not obsessed about cross-dressing. He belonged on a higher level. He truly understood gender equality!</p><br/><p>Anyone who opposes male cross-dresser is definitely looking down on females. His head should be caved in!</p><br/><p>This is Han Leng\u2019s view towards cross-dressing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was slightly disappointed to see Han Leng being so receptive towards cross-dressing. She was actually expecting to see a very abashed and reluctant Han Leng, eventually left with no choice but to relent. However, she felt that Han Leng had always wanted to cross-dress. He just never had the opportunity or a person to guide him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s appearance had helped fulfill Han Leng\u2019s deepest, darkest intention. She made his dream come true with both her hands</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue loved to mess with skin care products and cosmetics, reading all sorts of fashion magazines. She had become quite the skilled makeup artist. Like many other aspects of her, it had remained largely unknown at school.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve totally ruin Master Leng Zi\u2019s image the moment you speak, and you can\u2019t possibly bring a voice changer along.\u201d Zhao Youyue started to satirize Han Leng.</p><br/><p>Little did she know that Han Leng had already mastered the \u2018pseudo voice\u2019 technique. It\u2019s just a matter of choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cVoice? How do you think about my voice now?\u201d said Han Leng with his pseudo voice.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was amazed!</p><br/><p>If she did not know him as a boy in the first place, she would have been fooled on the spot. Such a sweet and cute voice had to be the voice of a typical cute girl!</p><br/><p>Of course, if you knew that he is a boy, you would be able to distinguish the flaws. Anyway, if Han Leng were to speak on the phone with his pseudo voice technique, he would fool the entire world!</p><br/><p>Even if I had not forced him, he would have started cross-dressing on his own accordeventually.</p><br/><p>I wonder what he had experienced in the past..</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue suddenly remembered a sentence. \u201cBoys who become cute have nothing to do with girls. Girls who become handsome have nothing to do with boys as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue considered herself very handsome. How could she not be handsome, after such a violin performance?</p><br/><p>She had even decided to completely restore and project Chu Luoxun\u2019s original music from the literary world into reality. This was also Chu Luoxun\u2019s wish.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was content with Lady Zhao\u2019s surprised reaction. He continued to speak in his pseudo voice, \u201cAs a writer, I really like to extract materials from any source of inspiration possible. Learning the pseudo voice technique was a kind of material extraction. There\u2019s no need to be so surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue truly admired Han Leng. She somehow felt that even if he were to go on a patronage date[1] one day in future, he would refer it to material extraction as well, experiencing a more exciting side of life\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out together. I\u2019ll buy a few more sets of suitable women\u2019s clothing as a present for you, and snap a few more sets of photos for my personal collection,\u201d said Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, let me change my clothes first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to change, let\u2019s just go out like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How can I possibly go out in such clothes? I\u2019m not an idiot, you know. People seldom wear 2D style clothing like this, unless we\u2019re at Comic Fiesta[2]\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, lost your balls? I thought that you truly did not care about how others view you. It seems like you\u2019re the bedroom-only type of cross-dresser\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I know that you\u2019re trying to provoke me, but I\u2019ll still bite the bait! I\u2019m not like those mortals! I\u2019m a writer, an artist that can create and destroy worlds! I truly need not care about how others look at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just realized that you\u2019re a fake hipster and real adolescent!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019m just living a life more honestly and frankly than others.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, Let\u2019s go\u2026Oh, right, how about some perfume?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me the best! Are there any 82s?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop joking! Be cooler!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Leng always dons a pair of pure white sneakers. The sneakers still seemed to be a good match to his stockings.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had forgotten about the shoes, but she could easily purchase one on the spot. She personally disliked wearing high heels. Somehow, she felt that Han Leng might rock them. This was also a form of material extraction</p><br/><p>Han Leng would definitely look like a model once he puts a pair of high heels on!</p><br/><p>Han Leng sounded very confident. However, the moment he walked out from the beauty salon, the nervousness took hold of him. He could the breeze beating about his lower portion. This was his first time wearing a skirt!</p><br/><p>It was also a liberating, new sensation\u2026He vaguely remembered that be it skirts or knee socks, they were initially men\u2019s clothing. When did they get classified as women\u2019s clothing, instead?</p><br/><p>The matter left him greatly disgruntled.</p><br/><p>By this time, Chen Haoran was staring at them blankly. He could see Zhao Youyue</p><br/><p>He saw no Leng Zi</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Patronage dating \u2013 Patronage dating is a noun phrase that originates from Japan, which refers to females promising to go out with males on dates in exchange for money, not necessarily having sexual behaviors.</p><br/><p>[2] Comic Fiesta \u2013 Comic Fiesta or CF for short, is Malaysia\u2019s longest-running convention that focuses on animation, comics and games (ACG).

Obviously, Zhao Youyue was responsible for his behavior too. If Zhao Youyue had not provoked Shi Jingnian\u2019s interest towards \u201crich lady types,\u201d he certainly would not have messed with Lu Xue.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was the siren that had led his ship to its demise. Perhaps when she acquired the iconic character cards, she would also absorb the \u201cmain protagonist\u2019s halo,\u201d and of course, bring success to that particular literary work.</p><br/><p>Whenever she possessed a character, she would take charge of the plot, while the corresponding author experiences an explosion of inspirations. As a result, the character would come to life beneath their pens. If the author was mediocre, to begin with, she would turn them into something world-class.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue and the authors had a mutually beneficial link.</p><br/><p>As for a weirdo like Shi Jingnian, he did not want success; he just wanted to be at peace with his harem. Unfortunately, as \u201cBakuman\u201d grew more successful, his aura was vacuumed away, so those cute girls started leaving him, one after the other.</p><br/><p>Even though Shi Jingnian was typically aloof, Lin Shiya\u2019s ending of the relationship had struck him hard. He did not ask her to stay, as he knew that he would only make her unhappy. Even though Lin Shiya was no longer his girlfriend; he still hoped she could be happy for the rest of her life.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian would also choose to let Lu Xue go if her family does not agree to let them both be in a romantic relationship. He knew Lu Xue could be unreasonable at times, but she was extremely filial to her parents, and he did not want to make things difficult for Lu Xue.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was the only girl that Shi Jingnian could not see through, but Zhao Youyue was clearly not interested in him, so he would not bother her. If Zhao Youyue ever came up to him, he would definitely do it. As long as he makes Zhao Youyue happier, everything that he did would gain meaning.</p><br/><p>He would not ask for any return favors; it would be his greatest honor to be of service to these beautiful ladies.</p><br/><p>Both of them had their last meal as a couple. Lin Shiya was crying all the while, but Shi Jingnian was still at his usual attitude, bringing up jokes in hopes of cheering her up. He stated that even though they were no longer a couple, she could always find him for help, and he would gladly offer his assistance. He could even go as far as to become her backup lover.</p><br/><p>His attitude only made Lin Shiya feel worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was all my fault; I will take full responsibility. I was the one who pulled the strings; I forced you into this,\u201d Shi Jingnian said with a smile on his handsome face. Even the curses of netizens could not affect his emotions.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s correct; those affected readers hated him so much they wanted him dead, but when they heard that his \u201cBakuman\u201d was truly interesting, they could not help but start reading anyway\u2026</p><br/><p>Those who could affect the emotions of Shi Jingnian were girls like Lin Shiya.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this; it was all my selfish vanity! I don\u2019t love you at all; I only stayed by your side so that I could use your talents, I\u2019m just a bad person!\u201d Lin Shiya gushed, being her harshest critic.</p><br/><p>\u201cBad people aren\u2019t as honest as you are. I really hope that you can be worse, and use me for the rest of your life.\u201d Shi Jingnian smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>Lin Shiya remained silent, because she had already decided to let go of the past; it was time to wake up from her dreams!</p><br/><p>Lin Shiya\u2019s mind wandered around as she exited the store with him, she just wanted to be as far away from Shi Jingnian as she could, and hoped that he would just leave her alone.</p><br/><p>She did not even notice a truck speeding towards her as she started crossing the road.</p><br/><p>Without a microsecond to spare, Shi Jingnian dove in and shoved Lin Shiya away from harm. He had little regard for his own life, and was unafraid of death. Even though Lin Shiya was not in a relationship with him anymore, he still chose to save her\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Shiya escaped death by a hair\u2019s breadth!</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian was not so fortunate. His body had escaped the worst of it all, but his handsome face had scraped across the harsh tarmac, while his long and slim legs were crushed by the truck.</p><br/><p>Now, he could only spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Shiya suddenly got reminded of what Shi Jingnian had once told her\u201dMy head is made of iron!\u201d</p><br/><p>Has the Great deity Su taken your legs?</p><br/><p>She shook the thoughts out of her head and quickly dialed for an ambulance, or else Shi Jingnian would really end up dead.</p><br/><p>When Lin Shiya saw the injured Shi Jingnian on the stretcher, she felt conflicted\u2026</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian had completely passed out, but she knew he would be happy and satisfied because she was still alive. He no longer had the looks to attract girls, and he might even have lost the ability of his loins. None of it would matter for him; for these beautiful ladies, he was willing to get smashed into pieces.</p><br/><p>This only set Lin Shiya\u2019s decision in stone, for she was afraid of bearing the responsibility and consequences\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Shiya did not even follow him to the hospital; she kept muttering to herself that Shi Jingnian was no longer of her concern.</p><br/><p>Lu Xue would never visit Shi Jingnian, because she had already found another person for replacement, a talented, beautiful lady would have an endless trail of followers and admirers.</p><br/><p>Two of Shi Jingnian close female friends went to visit him in the hospital, but both of them decided to avoid him as well, because his face had been completely ruined, and he had been crippled. One of them immediately ditched him after finding out that his family business had gone bankrupt, and that his father was now serving time.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian, a talented, rich and handsome author who was always seen around beautiful ladies suddenly became an abandoned child, despised by the world, over the events of one night.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian\u2019s mother lay crying by his side, worrying about his medical fees\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, this is all my fault, I still have a few hundred thousand in my card, use those to pay the debts. Don\u2019t waste it on me\u2026 I\u2019m already a useless person.\u201d Shi Jingnian felt truly guilty, because he had broken his mother\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Even now, he had never once looked in the mirror or bothered to try wriggling his toes. His looks did not concern him.</p><br/><p>He only felt loneliness at that moment, because he knew that cute ladies would no longer visit him.</p><br/><p>\u201cShi Jingnian, are you quitting halfway again? What do you mean by temporarily stopping publication?\u201d Zhao Youyue was urging Shi Jingnian to update his novel, not knowing of his current situation.</p><br/><p>It had been a month since the \u201cghostwriting\u201d incident. Shi Jingnian had vanished without a trace, and \u201cBakuman\u201d stopped serializing. The internet started spreading rumors about Shi Jingnian quitting halfway again; it made Zhao Youyue uneasy because this was not the first time it had happened.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Shi Jingnian no longer felt lonely. \u201cSorry, there\u2019s been a slight mishap. I\u2019ll continue writing right now!\u201d he replied, lightly slapping both sides of his cheeks.</p><br/><p>He felt euphoric once again, for he had been called. Zhao Youyue had only met him once, and she had contacted him at that moment. It greatly moved him.</p><br/><p>He was not going to blame those girls, because he knew that he already lost his attractiveness, nothing would be gained from following him.</p><br/><p>It was their best option to leave him, and he was happy that they had made a wise decision.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

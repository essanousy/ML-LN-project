The audience in \u201cMiss Purple\u2019s\u201d live broadcast room had increased due to this gimmick \u201cDaddy battle\u201d.</p><br/><p>Of course \u201cMiss Purple\u201d would enjoy watching it, and was rather eager to broadcast this Daddy Match, so she urged her teammates to surrender during the twenty-minute-mark. After quitting the game, she mentioned that she would be the witness of this match. So, these are the traditional rules of a solo battle, 100 last hits, first blood, first tower to win the game.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao had a terrible facial expression in front of the screen. He was seriously in bad mood after glancing upon the internet famous female streamer \u201cMiss Purple\u201d, but he was not going to back down a single bit!</p><br/><p>A solo battle map was chosen by the summoners, and without any ban session, they would go straight to the champion selection page without knowing whom the opponent was using.</p><br/><p>Jungling King, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>F*cking Demon King, \u201cHoho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jungling King, \u201cPrepare those Q coins, or you\u2019re gonna call me daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*cking Demon King, \u201cCut the crap and start the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJungling King\u201d had called on his best friend, a veteran in Server 1 to replace him instead. Even though Zhao Hao was not bothered about that 1,000 Q coins, but \u201cJungling King\u201d and his best friend valued it. Both of them agreed on splitting it 3-7, and his friend could gain 700 coins if he won. Anyway, for a university student like him, this sum of money was indeed a huge amount.</p><br/><p>As a result, Zhao Hao had lost terribly in his first round, even though his ranking was at Diamond 5, but his standard was only at Platinum 5, and his favorite champions were the assisting type and could not perform well in a solo battle. Not to mention, his opponent was a veteran in Server 1, whose dream was to become a professional mid lane player</p><br/><p>After winning his first round, a boy named \u201cCao Jinglong\u201d was getting cocky. He then turned to the owner of \u201cJungling King\u201d, Feng Ming and said, \u201cWho is this F*cking Demon King, he\u2019s obviously a noob! Torturing him was way too easy, wanna beat him up personally in your second round?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Feng Ming was insulting this F*cking Demon King, he waved his hands and declined, \u201cSave the time and win another round, you have more skills than I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, \u201cMiss Purple\u2019s\u201d pop-ups in the broadcasting room were all ridicules as such \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Daddy Match is way too boring, totally one-sided victory!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, AFKer will always be AFKer, NOOB!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a noob!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did he get all those courage to bet on that 1,000 Q coins?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo boring, I\u2019m leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss purple\u2019s inner self let out a huge sigh. She even thought that the skills of this \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d was no match for hers. Of course, she wondered how did he achieve a Diamond 5 ranking. Without further thoughts, she announced the start of the second match in low spirits.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Hao noticed the insults from his opponents and audience, he was so infuriated that he wanted to smash his computer! He might even smash it for real if he was at home.</p><br/><p>Having little knowledge of \u201cLoL\u201d, however, Zhao Youyue knew that Zhao Hao was beaten up pretty badly from aside. She said it out of compassion, \u201cBig bro, mind to let me try out one round?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fires in Zhao Hao\u2019s eyes almost burst out, \u201cAre you mocking me too? Are you telling me that your little bit of gaming skills is nothing different from mine?\u201d Zhao Hao roared in anger.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue thought to herself that her brother was indeed hot-tempered. How dare he speak to her in such a spleen attitude. Hmph, don\u2019t blame her for being mean too!</p><br/><p>Activating her \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d character card right away, Zhao Youyue bawled at him, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m mocking you! Just because my teeny weeny bit of game knowledge was far better than your next-to-zero standard, now step aside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao\u2019s anger had vanished after he was scolded by Zhao Youyue\u2019s \u201cunusual behavior\u201d. Perhaps due to Zhao Youyue\u2019s sudden change of attitude, it almost made him forgot why he was enraged at the first place. Zhao Youyue was still that super kind and gentle little sister awhile ago, how did she become such an irascible and ill-tempered lady all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao gave up his seat, feeling a little uneasy, Zhao Youyue sat right in front of the computer. Just when she grabbed the mouse, a familiar feeling began to surge up in her, as if she was one with the computer.</p><br/><p>After that, Zhao Youyue skillfully insulted her opponent while getting hold of this \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d, \u201cI was just going easy on you noobs! I know I could torture you single-handedly after seeing your silly manners.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Cao Jinglong replied with an ellipsis, he thought his opponent was a braggart king, for saying such words after being defeated in the previous match?</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work Youyue Meimei, just like my style. We can\u2019t lose any argument no matter what!\u201d Zhao Hao said it happily at one side.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro, which champion would you want me to use against him?\u201d Zhao Youyue said it arrogantly, with domineering confident of a master.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm, any champion will do?\u201d Zhao Hao was beyond his believes, what has given his little sister such confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, then pick Vayne. I kinda like this kind of champion which allowed one to show off the skills, but are you able to handle it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see so Vayne can be used to show off,\u201d without much consideration, she picked Vayne the Night Hunter instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? How many times have you used Vayne?\u201d Zhao Hao soon realized something was off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never used her before.\u201d Zhao Youyue said it straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how the f\u2026 you can play?\u201d Zhao Hao gulped back the word f*ck. But thinking that he would be beaten up badly by his opponent anyway, it did not matter anymore.</p><br/><p>Both champions were chosen, and they entered the loading screen. Then, both parties were able to see each other\u2019s champion and summoner spells.</p><br/><p>Thay had brought the same summoner spells for a solo match, what a coincidence, a combo of \u201cExhaust\u201d and \u201cIgnite\u201d.</p><br/><p>Cao Jinglong who was playing for his best friend on the other side, had chosen Caitlyn the Sheriff of Piltover from the champion selection page.</p><br/><p>When Cao Jinglong saw that Vayne was chosen by his opponent, he sneered. The champion Vayne could not perform to her potential unless the player had spent a lot of time on her. Besides, he had witnessed how stiff his opponent was during the last match. He did not believe that his opponent was able to use Vayne properly, not to mention that his champion was Sheriff!</p><br/><p>Caitlyn the Sheriff of Piltover was a champion who was most suitable for a solo match which requires 100 last hits, first blood, first tower solo battle. As she was regarded supercilious for her attack range in the early game, with a passive skill of 100 percent critical hit on every seventh attack, she definitely held an upper hand in a solo match. When both sides were ranged champions, she could easily suppress her opponent\u2019s HP with this huge advantage.</p><br/><p>In comparison to Caitlyn, Vayne was not one of the champions who could shine within a solo match, because Vayne was a typical earlier stage hero.</p><br/><p>Therefore, upon learning that his opponent had selected Vayne, Cao Jinglong reckoned that the game was set!</p>\n</div>"}

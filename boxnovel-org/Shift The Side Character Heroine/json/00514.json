It had not been cheap, costing him over a thousand. It should have wounded his spendthrift self, but he thought that it was worthwhile. His daughter had only given him more reason to be proud of her, even bringing along an elite scholar like Zhao Youyue. He had to ensure that they were properly welcomed.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s mother, grandfather, grandmother, and her two sisters were already waiting in the restaurant. It was quite a lively family gathering. Zhao Youyue was probably the only outsider there.</p><br/><p>Of course, as Zhao Youyue had already been invited to have a meal together with Su Li\u2019s family, they did not consider her as one. Su Li had long told her family that Zhao Youyue was her bestest friend, her dearest girlfriend. Without Lady Zhao, one of her many long weekends should have killed her already!</p><br/><p>With such a big age gap, they could still become the best of friends? Su Weiguo was rather puzzled. Still, considering the fact that that authors and readers who picked their books should share many common interests, age was not really a problem at all\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Weiguo thought that it was quite a pity. If Zhao Youyue had been a boy, things would be good. Looking at how intimate the both of them were, at least he would not have to worry about Su Li going single for the rest of her life.</p><br/><p>Su Li had everything else going for her, Su Weiguo only hoped that she could marry an honest man and complete the loop. That was all she needed for a peaceful and happy life. It did not matter if she slipped up once in a while. His daughter was so beautiful and talented. Of course, her other half would always forgive her\u2026</p><br/><p>The old Zhao Youyue would rather die than impose on a family banquet where she was the only stranger. It was all too awkward for her. However, she was different now. She had grown many more layers of skin on her face. Moreover, she was really close to Su Li. A caring lady like Su Li would never put her in a spot.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was still very confident in Su Li. For example, moments ago, Su Weiguo could not help but ask out of curiosity, \u201cXiao Zhao, why are you using a crutch for support?\u201d</p><br/><p>What the f*ck, what do you mean crutch? It\u2019s a staff; a jewel-encrusted staff, to be precise. I\u2019m cosplaying as Tokiomi Tohsaka, although the jewel is fake\u2026 Zhao Youyue was a little unhappy, but she just pouted for a bit before forcing a pleasant smile.</p><br/><p>Observant Su Li immediately stepped in.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady\u2026 Erm, little sister Youyue\u2019s body is a little frail, and she has some leg problems, so she has to use this crut\u2026 staff!\u201d Su Li quickly explained.</p><br/><p>Naturally, once Su Weiguo heard that, he was once again in awe. Zhao Youyue was so studious, and she talked in such a gentle, soft manner. She was the precious princessly type of girl that only the city of Jiangnan could produce. He did not expect her to also be physically challenged, broken in body but firm in spirit. Life had not been easy for her!</p><br/><p>Su Weiguo could not tell that Zhao Youyue was a missy at all. On the contrary, he believed that her family was probably living in poverty. Why else, would she possibly be the top scorer?</p><br/><p>In this era, only the poor would take their studies seriously\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Weiguo\u2019s mind had remained where it was from one or two decades back, even as time left him in the dust.</p><br/><p>After all, a long time ago, one could change their destiny by enrolling in a university. Nowadays, university students were\u2026 nevermind.</p><br/><p>He believed that it would be better for those that were from poor families to start working earlier or to attend a vocational high school and pick up some skills. It just might help them live through the cruel world.</p><br/><p>Of coures, Su Li had assumed that Lady Zhao was going through another severe bout of sophohigh syndrome. If only she knew that Lady Zhao actually believed herself to be a peerless swordsmaster at that point. That staff was no crutch; she ruled the world with it.</p><br/><p>Shortly after that, Zhao Youyue met Su Li\u2019s family members. She seemed anything but typical Zhao Youyue. She greeted them naturally and courteously as they were introduced to her, one after another. Hiding behind her not-exactly-guise of a brilliant student and top scorer in the college entrance examinations, she deceived all these new faces.</p><br/><p>Finally, the long-awaited meeting with Su Li\u2019s two sisters came to pass. The second sister \u2013 Su Jue did not seem much to be a talker. As she was glued to her mobile phone the entire time, she became a target for Su Li\u2019s mother to demonstrate her motherly nagging. When it finally became too much, she hunched over and ate her food in silence. She seemed to be on the verge of bursting out in a fit.</p><br/><p>The younger Su Lin, was far livelier, befitting of her age. She was closer to Su Li and kept asking for hugs and kisses. She deliberately did it in front of Zhao Youyue, in a show of ownership. She could not be blamed, for Su Li kept repeatedly referring to Zhao Youyue as \u201clittle sister Youyue.\u201d No one could snatch the best sister in the world from her!</p><br/><p>Ironically, it only made Zhao Youyue more convinced of her cuteness. She had prepared gifts for the both of them. They were not expensive, but it represented her kind thoughts.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s family gave Zhao Youyue an excellent impression. She even felt good about Su Jue who was addicted to her mobile phone. The table was releasing all those boredom hormones. Of course even she would feel the urge of playing her mobile phone as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, she held the urge down. This was to spare Su Li some face. Moreover, Su Li\u2019s parents were highly interested in her \u201ctop scorer in the college entrance examinations\u201d identity. Thus she was bombarded with questions. Then, her parents proceeded to educate Su Jue. Look at how perfect Zhao Youyue is!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue empathized with Su Jue, even though she was clearly from another family!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue only hoped that Su Jue would not be resentful. She was probably the prettiest among the three sisters of the Su family. Her complexion was flawless. Her name could not have been a better fit, she was as truly pretty as a jade[1].</p><br/><p>Su Jue was actually doing pretty well in school. She was currently attending the best high school in the city. She also had a knack for calligraphy, surpassing that of even Zhao Youyue\u2019s skills.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s words were pure and beautiful, but she had never learned calligraphy before.</p><br/><p>Meals were usually very enjoyable for guests. Of course, Su Li was probably very upset, because Su Li\u2019s grandparents and parents had once again asked an old-fashioned question during the meal. Have you found a partner yet? If you still do not want to look for one, it could get really difficult for you!</p><br/><p>Questions on whether she had found a partner were common table talk. Previously, Su Li always say the same thing. You guys are really annoying. Do I look like I really want to get married?</p><br/><p>Today, she almost blurted out an entirely different answer. You know what? I only like girls. I don\u2019t want to get married to someone else. I want to take someone else as my wife!</p><br/><p>Well, who are you going to take as your wife?</p><br/><p>Hehe. I\u2019ve already brought her here to meet you personally, don\u2019t you know that?</p><br/><p>Of course, Su Li managed to reel it in. Instead, she was forced to agree on going on a blind date\u2026</p><br/><p>This was purely Zhao Youyue\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>To please Su Li\u2019s elders, Lady Zhao had chimed in. Blind dates did not mean that you had to date right away. You could just meet the other person and get to know them a little. Who knows, it might even be really fun. The internet was rich with reviews of people sharing their blind date experiences, and they were usually very interesting. Who knows, it could even serve as inspiration for her work!</p><br/><p>Su Li agreed begrudgingly. She knew that Lady Zhao was just being playful again \u2013 and there was no way to stop her!</p><br/><p>At first, Su Li\u2019s elders were surprised. Then, they were overjoyed. Getting Su Li to agree on anything like this was nothing but impossible. Their impression on Zhao Youyue only rose through the roof\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue smiled sweetly. Su Jue, who had been really quiet the whole time, suddenly realized something. She shot icicles in Zhao Youyue\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] Su Jue\u2019s name in Chinese characters is , the second word of her name  means precious gems.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

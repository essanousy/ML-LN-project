She would use her status as \u201cSect Master\u201d, to instill Su Li with a guilty conscience. Unlike other readers, she did this just because she want to stand up for \u201cXu Jing\u201d. She felt wonderful for having Xu Jing, the iconic character card, which she totally fallen into.</p><br/><p>No matter what situation, Zhao Youyue felt like she would not sacrifice Xu Jing\u2019s character card easily. Unlike Xu Jing\u2019s character setting, Zhao Youyue was a precious daughter in the family, her parents were healthy too. Xu Jing however, faced great limitation in learning, as she had to help her mother with chores, and taking care of her father who was very ill.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had plenty of time to learn, but she lacked the perseverance to do so. Even though she knew she had to change, she always could not resist her urge to play with her mobile phone, thus making her wasted precious time on meaningless entertainment.</p><br/><p>After she had Xu Jing, she used Xu Jing\u2019s \u201cability\u201d to learn more while she had time in her disposal. She used to admire those who can play music instruments, those who can sing and dance at school festivals, something she could not do. Jiang Qing, \u201cThe little angel\u201d who sat beside her in class, was one of those people she admired.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was always a kind person, she never felt any jealousy toward others. She thought of herself as someone who had zero talent, and yet refuse to have the resolve to learn any skill, so she was just another face in the crowd who cheered for others.</p><br/><p>Things are different now after the appearance of Xu Jing. The character herself, yearns for knowledge, not just limited to those that can be acquired from books but to her surroundings as well. Due to her character\u2019s settings, she did not have the chance to do so.</p><br/><p>In reality, Zhao Youyue can utilize this ability of hers, to accomplish what she wanted to learn. For instance, she can always let Xu Jing to \u201cpossess\u201d her into learning a musical instrument that she wished to.</p><br/><p>She remembered that she used to learn violin, piano and GuZheng \u2013 an ancient Chinese music instrument, when she was at young age. She learned violin for three months, while the others did not even last for a month before she gave up on them.</p><br/><p>She was always full of confidence at the beginning of a lesson, determined to master it. Even if it meant having to sacrifice her weekends to do so. This had her thrown her mind off balance, while other kids used to enjoy their weekends while she was stuck learning musical instruments.</p><br/><p>When she had this thought in her mind, all those resolve to learn music instrument, dreaming of becoming one of the best musicians out there, would vanish instantly. After that, she would only think of how to enjoy her leisure time activity.</p><br/><p>As time passed on, Zhao Youyue knew she was just an average person who do stuffs at the heat of the moment. She did not had the perseverance nor consistency, she knew that herself too well.</p><br/><p>Plus, her family\u2019s condition were pretty great, living her life stress-free, she never appreciated the value of money because it came to her easily. An average family\u2019s kid would understand that chances of learning a musical instrument was not easy, and those lessons are certainly not cheap so they had to appreciate every single opportunity.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue even had her own kick-starter website, she created it earlier in this semester. She had a decent amount of money in there, a few ten thousands, yet she did not felt anything great about it, she just thought of it as her own personal savings.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue never encountered any financial problems before, she was never obsessed with limited edition branded items, or custom-made clothes that can cost up to hundreds thousand.</p><br/><p>She felt content with those few thousands clothes, ten thousand at most. Zhao Youyue was usually seen with her uniform, even during weekend where everyone else would change into their fancy outfit except for her. Who would have thought that Zhao Youyue was a fair, rich and beautiful person if they never really knew her in person?</p><br/><p>Winter holidays were approaching, as well as New Year. Zhao Youyue could easily receive RMB up to few ten thousands from her parents. Even though her mother, Wang Hua acknowledged that daughter needs to be well taken care of, she would not give her pocket money directly like other parents would do.</p><br/><p>There is absolutely no chance that a rich daughter ran out of money, like situation in novel or manga, was about to do some questionable acts in order to earn a living, get saved by a miraculously well-timed protagonist, followed by falling in love with him and joined in the harem of protagonist.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue treats materialistic stuffs lightly as she did not appreciate the value of money, or whatever stuffs that can be bought with it, of course she did not brag about how rich she was either.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing was struck by awe that how easily Zhao Youyue can tip 1,000 RMB of Sect Master in Qidian manga website without hesitation, fans often asked, \u201cDo you need someone to be friends with?\u201d, referring her a tycoon.</p><br/><p>She did not think of herself as a tycoon because 1,000 RMB really does not seem that much to her. If she was in a good mood, she would definitely tip a few 10,000 RMB of Silver Sect Master in a day. Since Qidian manga website had global notice, she most felt her sense of presence.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyou sometimes thought to herself that it would be even better if she was spending her own well-earned money, not having to rely on her father\u2019s pocket money, it would have made her proud and felt awesome about it. Now that she acquired the \u201cability\u201d to learn passionately, she would like to have the ability to make her own money as well. It depends on how she worked her way through it though, whether creating another iconic character, as an artist or author, she would accept it gladly.</p><br/><p>She even hoped that she could enter the realm of entertainment with superstars, where she could acquire the ability to sing so she could use it to make money in reality, but then things are not easy as it sounds, if she can enter into any realm at will, what was the point to sacrifice a character\u2019s card?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was in a good condition, with her mind set to \u201cno disappointment without expectation\u201d, she sleeps soundly at night. She was not eager to explore the new world in another dimension, not until final exams are over at least. She wanted to commit herself to learning for the upcoming days, transforming into the Goddess herself, \u201cXu Jing\u201d.</p>\n</div>"}

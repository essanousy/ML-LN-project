Moreover, the support by the tycoon audiences had increased her popularity drastically. Not long after, Douyu live broadcast platform took the initiative to come to her doorstep to sign a contract with her.</p><br/><p>Throughout the process, she remained hidden. It was her father, Zhao Jiayi who greeted Douyu\u2019s director, Zhao Jiaren, and further asked a lawyer to directly help facilitate the contract. The terms were very favorable. Zhao Youyue was indeed a member of Zhao family.</p><br/><p>Even the contracting staff member of Douyu officials was dumbfounded. He had also watched Ah Yu\u2019s live broadcast. Even after yesterday, when she had live-streamed herself spamming money and flashing her Tencent\u2019s Xinyue member level 3 symbol, he wouldn\u2019t have thought that she would have this much capability. It was not until the moment when she did not even turn up in person during the contracting process, but had the senior director come in her place, that he suddenly wanted to kneel before her. Who is she? Isn\u2019t this a bit too much?</p><br/><p>Such news quickly spread throughout the livestream industry. The \u2018UC Shock Department'[1] was specialized at heating up such matters. The title was \u201cShocking! The Douyu Streamer, Ah Yu\u2019s true identity is the daughter of Douyu\u2019s director, Douyu seems to be under her family\u2019s name!\u201d.</p><br/><p>The news started with a thorough description of Ah Yu\u2019s live broadcast yesterday. She was said to be absolutely worthy of the title \u2018Douyu\u2019s Yu Shengfan\u2019 in terms of gaming. The news also expressed that her livestreaming style was amusing and witty. She was even praised for being multitalented. Her violin was superb!</p><br/><p>This was obviously Douyu, who intentionally created a sensational wave for Ah Yu, after signing a contract with her. Without a doubt, her Lady identity was most daunting.</p><br/><p>Some female live streamers who also had the \u2018Lady\u2019 title were not always real ladies. They did not have the \u2018Lady\u2019 aura. But Lady Ah Yu was always in style. She did not even care about that little money gifts, not even when it could recover the money spammed from whaling.</p><br/><p>After all, most female live streamers only wanted to earn money. Therefore, they had to please the audiences, the tycoons, especially. But Zhao Youyue was not like them. She only asked to be acknowledged. She wanted to become perfect, step-by-step, and conquer everyone. That was the accomplishment that she sought for.</p><br/><p>Lots of internet users noticed the UC Shock Department going at it again. They complained one after another\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Shock Department receives more cash to publish \u2018soft articles\u2019 again. Is this Ah Yu\u2019s recruitment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever heard about \u2018Lady Ah Yu.\u2019 I only know a \u2018Lady miss.'\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? \u2018Douyu Yu Shengfan\u2019? Isn\u2019t it just a sprayer[2] with no quality? I\u2019ve watched her live broadcasts before. Very general.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched her live broadcast yesterday. Her new style was quite nice. The various poisonous chicken soup statements were so funny. Her gaming skills were pretty good. Her violin performance at the end was even more amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is not \u2018Douyu Yu Shengfan\u2019 at all; she should be called \u2018Douyu\u2019s No.1 Violinist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve already subscribed to her, because she truly relies on her skills and talents to survive. She isn\u2019t like those sexy b*tch prostitutes. I believe that she can become famous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Some insightful audiences believed that Ah Yu would definitely become famous. However, she might find more success with her music than her gaming.</p><br/><p>In fact, the type of live streamer that can really get stabilized and be sought after by tycoons, would be the musician types. For example, the \u2018Miss Douyu\u2019 Feng Timo, and Ah Leng, who had settled in Douyu recently, are consistently sought out by Douyu officials. They were both music live streamers and could sing very well.</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Youyue\u2019s current violin skill level was pretty good, it had not yet reached her peak level. She believed that she would be able to reach \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds state one day.</p><br/><p>Once she reaches \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds music state, the effects of the live broadcasting would be something else. The audiences would be spirited away into a new world through her music and would never be able to come back\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 who had maxed music talents could play not only the violin; she had also mastered other instruments. She could even play a guitar and sing. Although she had not yet presented it within the novel, now that Zhao Youyue was here, how could she not present such an ability?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had to upstage the novel, no matter what. If the audiences only remember her being good at playing violin and nothing else, her character card might not reflect her other talents.</p><br/><p>She currently had an advantage in the literary world of \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d The readers did not hate Leng Zi for putting considerable effort into depicting \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds music. When they read the musical plots related to \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 it was as if they could hear the beautiful music flowing out from within the words.</p><br/><p>Many readers sighed. How nice would it be if \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 really existed in reality. If so, they could directly enjoy her beautiful music with their ears, instead.</p><br/><p>Leng Zi\u2019s writings had also been recognized by countless readers, as many readers were able to listen the music from within for the first time when they read Leng Zi\u2019s work. Conditionally, you must read every single word, attentively immersing yourself into the artistic conception of the work. If not, you will not be able to enjoy the supreme feeling of the text mixing in with music.</p><br/><p>The latest issue of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d was the arc where \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was unaffected even though Gu Yuan had messed things up during the music competition, only for them to continue performing. Some readers cried after reading that arc. They had been totally influenced by \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds persistence towards music. The tacit understanding between her and the male lead, Gu Yuan had given many readers an endless amount of tangles and knots in their hearts!</p><br/><p>Some readers who had been conquered by \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds charm, clamored one after another to let her gain the upper position. She was more beautiful than the heroine, Lin Meiyue. She could even co-operate with the male protagonist in music \u2013 on such a level that spoke from the soul. Why couldn\u2019t she become the heroine?</p><br/><p>However, there were also many readers who supported the lovely couple, Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue. They started having doubts, if \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019s\u2019 development was a little too premeditated. Although she said that she liked the male protagonist\u2019s gay friend, Chen Hao, she had flirted with the male protagonist in the name of music. This was obviously the doings of a \u2018third person\u2019!</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, the \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 gang did not like such a statement. They criticized, \u201cSome readers are too mentally dark. \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 has always wanted to rescue the male protagonist\u2019s music career only. At the same time, she has continuously assisted both the male protagonist and heroine. She had never thought of stealing the male protagonist from the heroine at all. This is considered a \u2018third person\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTry to find a \u2018third person\u2019 who will encourage a couple to get together in reality, please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, if it\u2019s not because of \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 Gu Yuan would be struggling to get closer to Lin Meiyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1.UC Shock Department The UC Shock Department refers to a group of people who always write news on a web browser called UC Browser.

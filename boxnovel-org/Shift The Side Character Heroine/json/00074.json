The luxurious car might not have a flashy appearance, but the price was not less than three million. Even though it could not be compared to those top-tier sports cars, but not many people could afford to own this car, not to mention that the car plate was 58888. It allowed someone to look wealthy and rich with this kind of plate number!</p><br/><p>Even though Ye Hai lived in a high-class condominium in the capital, but he bought it when the house price was not so terrifying. He only had this house as his asset. As for Zhao Youyue, it was not just the house in Jiang Nan district, her family had a sea-view house for vacation, and they also bought several properties overseas. In any case, they were never short of places to live\u2026</p><br/><p>Ye Hai\u2019s car was considered a good-to-go as it worthed an approximately four hundred thousand. However, when it was compared to \u201cYouyue\u201d Tycoon\u2019s car, there was no room for competition. If he was really rich to the point of not caring the income of writing webnovels, he would not have to update his 6,000 words per chapter constantly. He had high hopes that \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d would bring him to the path of becoming a God.</p><br/><p>Apart from the car, the way Youyue Tycoon dressed up, her face and aura showed that she really was an extremely fair, rich and beautiful person. Who would have thought that such a tycoon was a loyal reader of his book, and he actually ignored her carelessly!</p><br/><p>What to do, Rosemary\u2019s previous three League of Legend novels had only twenty over Sect Masters altogether. However, those Sect Masters who had previously communicated with him were only student readers. They really loved Rosemary\u2019s novel, so they saved 1,000 RMB and tipped him. He did not have the heart to accept it and even asked them not to tip. It was enough for them to spend six dollars per month to subscribe the original novel and supported him. Even though there were some Sect Masters whom he had never communicated, his impression of Sect Master had remained as someone who was not rich but had tipped him because they liked his book way too much.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai was nothing like Su Li who shamelessly asked for tips from readers with all sort of hints and signs. He just hoped that the readers could subscribe to the original novel. He could even discuss his works peacefully with readers who read his pirated novels, and was able to reform some of them. Ye Hai even turned them into readers who would read his original works. After all, you only need a few bucks per month, and then grabbed some red packets in the group, then you would be able to read the original novel for one month. You could say that those who cannot afford to read webnovels are not short of small cash, but they are just too lazy to read the original ones. Besides, they have the mindset of taking advantages of others. Since there are so many others who have subscribed to the original novel, it would make no difference with or without them. When all the pirated readers have these kinds of thoughts, it would usually destroy a novel\u2019s subscription. Consequently, the author would choose to give up due to disappointment.</p><br/><p>In this world, only a minority of authors continued writing even with their horrible subscriptions and results. Some readers would always question the writers regarding their updates on the novels as the readers thought that their books were wonderful!</p><br/><p>Actually the reason behind the non-updated books was all because of the low subscriptions and less royalties. The authors could not even pay the electricity bills with one month\u2019s royalties. There was no point in writing anymore. The authors would have a better future with just moving bricks than writing.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai even had a one-way mindset, that there was no actual tycoon if all of them were reading webnovels. Those people who tipped the top-ranked Godly writers 100,000 or 1,000,000 coins must be a one-man show, where they paid people to tip themselves. If not, it was impossible for others to tip a person 100,000 or 1,000,000 coins over a book. He was not even the hostess of those live shows, where they would hang out privately with those tycoons\u2026</p><br/><p>Ye Hai had much confidence that if he could write the story properly, he would not be short of tips once the word counts started to stack. He never imagined that his book was actually liked by an actual tycoon, yet he assumed the tycoon was just like any other normal Sect Master, such a miscalculation! Was it possible that the tycoon had the characteristics of a side character, where people tend to ignore her?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the \u201cLone Elderly Club\u201d group was filled with praise towards Tycoon Youyue \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t imagine that Tycoon Youyue is actually a fair, rich and beautiful person. I envy Su Li for sitting and taking pictures together with Tycoon Youyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsking for Tycoon Youyue\u2019s QQ ID. I want to recommend my own book!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better for you to recommend your own pillow. Don\u2019t make such a silly dream\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not right. Tycoon Youyue is also my Sect Master, but she\u2019s not in my fans group. I must add her into mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe we should add Tycoon Youyue into this group?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is such a wonderful suggestion! Next time if we write about the life of a rich person, we just need to ask Tycoon Youyue to prevent embarrassing plot in which the Emperor carries a gold or silver pole[2]. As for the image of a precious daughter, we just need to follow the image of Tycoon Youyue. It will not go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Li, What do you think? After all you two look really close to each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li had no idea how the conversation was sidetracked in such a way. She was actually quite selfish as she was not willing to share a tycoon like Zhao Youyue. However, she also did not want to cause an unpleasant scene with these Godly writers. If she was able to maintain a good relationship, then she would be able to ask them to recommend the chapters from her new book in the future. Normally, Godly writers would only recommend chapters for their close writing friends, if not it would be a hassle. The most embarrassing moment would be that some rookie authors kept on pushing for chapters\u2019 recommendation even though they were not getting along. At the very least, these rookie authors should reach a certain level or be friends with some Godly writers, and then only ask for a chapter recommendation.</p><br/><p>Su Li replied, \u201cI will ask her. If she wants to join, then I will add her in.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the group manager \u201cEmperor of water\u201d who was viewing the chat, made Su Li a group admin. He rarely spoke in the group. It was like he was hinting Su Li to decide herself whether to add or not. This lead to a new round of bombardment\u2026</p><br/><p>Ye Hai cleared his QQ friends\u2019 list by deleting a dozen friends who had never spoken to him after adding his QQ. He then took the initiative to add Su Li as a friend. At the same time, he recalled the conversation with the group manager of his fans group \u201cWind\u2019s Whisper\u201d, without any hesitation, he sent a friend request to Youyue. The identity verification message was, \u201cTycoon Youyue, I\u2019m terribly sorry. I was busy perfecting the settings for \u2018The Strongest King\u2019, and was too concentrated on gathering materials. It was careless of me for not adding you as a friend. Tycoon, please let me hug your leg [1]! Let me be your friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] Hug your leg () \u2013 to use other\u2019s advantage or influence to gain self-interest or benefits.</p><br/><p>[2] The Emperor carries a golden pole () \u2013 the ordinary people\u2019s misconception of how the rich people do something. The peasants thought that the Emperor would carry a golden pole, in fact, the Emperor needs not carry one.</p>\n</div>"}

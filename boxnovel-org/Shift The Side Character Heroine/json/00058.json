She felt that she could unleash her full potential and minimize careless mistake on other subjects, not while having Xu Jing by her side.</p><br/><p>The mathematics test was far too difficult to be handled by most students, not even Zhou Fang herself. Zhou Fang felt terrible as she knew she messed up real bad, she was almost certain that she could not make it to the top five and most likely drop out of ten, that would be her worst humiliation in her life, she could not help herself but to cry as soon as she reached her dorm.</p><br/><p>The school had the tradition of sending the students\u2019 result to their home at the midst of winter holidays, thus making most of the students felt very uncomfortable and could not celebrate New Year with a ease of mind. Just as Zhou Fang predicted, she ranked 18 among her classmates and she only got 111 out of 160 for her mathematics test. This result made her plan of becoming a bachelor or even professor seemed like a joke. She could not imagine herself being in a relationship with someone, not with these kind of grades.</p><br/><p>At the beginning of second semester, Zhou Fang found out that Zhao Youyue ranked 7 in class on the last final exam. The same Zhao Youyue on whom she had taken pity achieved a whooping score of 138 on mathematics, one of the best in class! Zhao Youyue had the advantage because the test was too hard for everyone.</p><br/><p>There must be some kind of mistake! It could not be!</p><br/><p>Zhou Fang felt that Zhao Youyue must be lucky to be able to score this high, after all she thought Zhao Youyue would always study at the very last minute, and she got lucky big time. As time goes on, she soon to realized that reality can be cruel sometimes.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After she reached home, Zhao Youyue disabled \u201cXu Jing\u2019s possession\u201d mode and entered \u201csloth mode\u201d. All that determination of learning earlier were nowhere to be found, she did not even bother to look at the huge piles of holiday homework.</p><br/><p>Why did it ended up like this?</p><br/><p>When did it all started?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was one of those good students during her primary school days, she would finish up her whole holiday homework before she started to enjoy her holidays.</p><br/><p>She lost her initiative upon entering secondary school, on her first year she would divide her homework into portions and started to finish it up on a daily basis.</p><br/><p>During the end of her second year, she rushed all of her homework during her last three days of holiday. She knew that her teacher would not bother to mark them, so she just wrote whatever answer that came into her mind without even reading the questions.</p><br/><p>While on her third year, she would borrow from her friends for \u201creference\u201d purposes. She realized that the teacher would not collect their work at the start of each semester, a perfect chance for her to \u201crefer\u201d others for their work, so that she would not waste any of her holidays.</p><br/><p>Why does holiday homework exist? What was the purpose of it? Holidays were meant for students to relax, and play to their heart\u2019s content, Zhao Youyue thought to herself that homework are meant to be done in school. She was way too \u201csmart\u201d to spend her holidays on homework.</p><br/><p>Upon entering high school, with the help of technology and internet, Zhao Youyue can easily get her work done without having to \u201crefer\u201d from other students. Zhao Youyue can access the internet with her smartphone or tablet, with much accurate answers or information.</p><br/><p>Lately, Zhao Youyue stumbled across a game called \u201cKings of Glory[1]\u201d, nicknamed \u201cKings\u2019 Pesticide[2]\u201d, which she got addicted to. According to its fanbase, this game had a lot of primary school students playing it. Thanks to its publisher, Tencent Games, it\u2019s popularity went skyrocket. There were a lot of players from \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d, a PC platform game, switched into the mobile version of it, \u201cKings of Glory\u201d. Zhao Youyue was not good in gaming, with her gaming skill equivalent to a primary school student, she often get roasted for being a noob in game.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for Zhao Youyue, \u201cKoG\u201d was a skill based game, which made her most powerful asset, cash became useless. As she watched her base getting destroyed helplessly, with the chat box full of negative comments scolding her, this ultimately caused her to delete the game furiously.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue thought that skill-based games were boring, not only that she could not beat other players, she could not win in an argument either. Due to her kind personality and side character traits, she rarely got herself into a fight with others and nobody ever bullied her. Not sure it was a sad thing or not.</p><br/><p>After deleting \u201cKoG\u201d, Zhao Youyue decided to regain her pride in \u201cLoL\u201d. She booted up her lag-free, top notch gaming PC, with every setting on maximum output, even though she had zero knowledge about it. She then proceeded to log-in her max leveled ID in game.</p><br/><p>Reaching maximum level was just the beginning, she never got passed the bronze level in ranking tournaments, totally suited her gaming skill level. She did possess a lot of costumes for her heroes, especially cute ones where she bought with impulse, but that did not increase her skill level as a gamer.</p><br/><p>Shortly after login \u201cLoL\u201d, a QQ message popped out, it was from Han Leng. He invited Zhao Youyue to play with him so he could carry her up to a higher ranking in game because they were on the same server, \u201cMountain of God\u201d. Another reason was this server had a lot of noobs, where it got the nickname, \u201cGiant God\u2019s Pit\u201d. Han Leng was already at diamond level, he thought it should be not much of a problem to carry a bronze level Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Thirty minutes later, Zhao Youyue stared at the word \u201cDEFEAT\u201d on her screen, making her had the urge to delete the game, again.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Han Leng stared at his screen awkwardly. He did not expect Zhao Youyue to be that bad in game, and the other teammate were not exactly helpful either. While his team managed to kill one or two enemies, their team ended up with a total wipe-out, he could not think of any excuses to cheer his teammates.</p><br/><p>So it is this difficult to carry a girl to a higher ranking?</p><br/><p>Han Leng had come to realize this harsh truth.</p><br/><p>He was dumbfounded by Zhao Youyue\u2019s amateurish gaming skills. But he still found her cute even so.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue got tired of playing games, she decided to enter the mysterious Dimensional Gate once again for the third time. What literary world awaited her this time? she wondered as she fell asleep at night.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Glory ()</p><br/><p>[2] Pesticide ()</p><br/><p>In Chinese, [1] and [2] have similar pronunciation. Some Chinese refer to King\u2019s Glory as King\u2019s Pesticide just for fun.</p>\n</div>"}

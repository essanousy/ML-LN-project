However, he had not forgotten about how this sister of his, who clearly had a low sense of presence, had showcased her gaming talents the other day. If not for Zhao Youyue\u2019s humility, he might have been embarrassed to death\u2026</p><br/><p>For a young master like Zhao Hao who lacked nothing, reputation was obviously the most important thing to him. Zhao Youyue had helped him earn his reputation back, and had even treated him with respect. This made him feel that this cousin sister of his was especially sharp-witted. She was way better than his other maternal cousin sister, Zhang Wanjun, who was quite arrogant and hard to get along with.</p><br/><p>However, it was a pity that Zhao Youyue did not attend school in Shanghai. Shanghai was Zhao Hao\u2019s home field. Even though he still kept in touch with Zhao Youyue, they did not meet up often. Therefore, it was only natural for them to drift apart.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Zhao Hao and Zhang Wanjun were still on good terms. Although Zhang Wanjun disliked him, he would still call Zhang Wanjun every now and then to meet up for a meal or simply hang out. Of course, they would remain close.</p><br/><p>There was no other way around it. Zhang Wanjun attended university in Shanghai, and he could pick her up easily, as she was only a 10 or 20 minutes drive away. If he were to drive to Jiangnan Province to meet Zhao Youyue, it would take him nearly an hour, and he even had to use the expressway\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if he wanted to fawn over his little cousin, the distance caused him too much trouble. He did not have much free time, as he also wanted to have fun with his bunch of scoundrel-friends, like Ding Yuncong, as well as his celebrity girlfriend Tan Jing, who he liked very much and had a stable relationship with.</p><br/><p>This gradually caused the drift between Zhao Hao and Zhao Youyue; it was bound to happen.</p><br/><p>The more Zhao Hao looked at the video of the New Year\u2019s Eve party, the more he compared himself to Zhao Youyue. Considering the fact that both of them were descendants of the reputable Zhao family, she seemed too distant!</p><br/><p>Such a perfect, dazzling girl was his sister. This was such a wonderful thing!</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue\u2019s brother, he could put his identity to good use and act pompously in front of his friend, Ding Yuncong!</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Ding Yuncong swear that Ah Yu could not possibly have any semblance of beauty? It had turned out to be a load of nonsense. In the video, this sister of his was not only extremely beautiful; she was practically a goddess. She was indeed from the Zhao family, having such superior disposition and grace!</p><br/><p>Even though the young master Zhao Hao was very mediocre in all aspects, he carried himself with great sense of honor that stemmed from his family\u2019s name. He was also open-minded and easygoing. Those traits gave him the ability to gather a group of competent people to work for him. As to how he utilized his workforce, both his grandfather and father had no qualms about it.</p><br/><p>As a member of the Zhao family, Zhao Hao favored those who shared his surname. Zhao Youyue\u2019s surname was Zhao, and Zhang Wanjun\u2019s surname was not, thus he naturally favored Zhao Youyue. It was a pity that he had previously thought that Zhang Wanjun was better and more talented than Zhao Youyue. Furthermore, since Zhang Wanjun lived in Shanghai, it was natural that Zhao Hao, being the \u201ccelestial ruler,\u201d could only watch over Zhang Wanjun.</p><br/><p>However, he now felt that he could not afford another moment of separation from sister Youyue. He had to keep such a talent close by his side. This way, his standing in the family would grow firmer. She was the most reliable assistant that he could find.</p><br/><p>He almost finished the entire video of the New Year\u2019s Eve party in one single breath. Of course, he skipped over many other programmes. With his \u201cpointer,\u201d he could instantly skip to the \u201cexciting\u201d parts of the video. Zhao Youyue\u2019s piano accompaniment, as well as violin performance, surprised him once again. He never knew that the violin could be played this way!</p><br/><p>This also finally allowed him to confirm that Zhao Youyue was Ah Yu. Ah Yu\u2019s violin skills were already widely known by everyone.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, when he listened to Zhao Youyue\u2019s voice whenever she did her emceeing and compared it to her live streams, they sounded very similar.</p><br/><p>Of course, if it was not for the busybody \u201cIce Queen of the North\u201d who exposed everything, no one would explicitly carry out a comparison. However, now that comparison has been made side-by-side, the truth came to light!</p><br/><p>All this started, the moment Zhao Youyue accidentally exposed her school uniform. When many netizens attempted to track down her high school based on uniforms, they stumbled upon a video of the New Year\u2019s Eve party. Then, they thought about how Ah Yu mentioned that she had not been able to live stream as she was busy with rehearsals for the New Year\u2019s Eve party\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, the dazzling host of the party, Zhao Youyue, had even provided the audience with such a high-leveled violin performance. Her voice gave off an uncanny level of similarity. If she was not Ah Yu, no one else could possibly be Ah Yu!</p><br/><p>When Zhao Hao saw things such as \u201cWorship,\u201d\u201dKneeling down for you,\u201d\u201dMy heart is conquered,\u201d\u201dGenius,\u201d and \u201cWife\u201d appearing uncontrollably on the video, he felt quite honored. No matter what, Zhao Youyue was still the closest younger cousin sister he had, and was a true-blooded member of the prestigious Zhao family. His father and Zhao Youyue\u2019s father were siblings. Now that Zhao Youyue was sought after by so many netizens, he could not help but feel proud. The Zhao family was really the cream of the crop!</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Hao proceeded to look at some other videos, including interviews with Zhao Youyue held by the school, as well as all sorts of videos which praised her for her excellent performance in school and showcased her achievements. He felt that his little cousin sister was just too brilliant. Unlike him, who spent all of his school days doing inappropriate things\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao knew that he was not talented in any aspect. The only thing he had was his respectable family background. Acknowledging this, he had learned how to borrow the power of others to boost himself. He was never jealous of the people who had more talent than him. He had the resources, and he could easily bend these talents to his heel!</p><br/><p>Prior to this, there was a period of time where Zhao Hao liked to show off his wealth, excessively. Now that he had a few more years under his belt, he has matured quite a bit. Thus, when he discovered that Zhao Youyue was way more brilliant and outstanding than he had imagined, he decisively took advantage of the New Year\u2019s holidays to get in touch with Zhao Youyue, as he wanted to rebuild their relationship.</p><br/><p>It could be said that deep down, Zhao Hao was a utilitarianist. However, those talents under his employment would always feel that they have received proper recognition, and were willing to keep working for him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao also looked around on the internet to see what the netizens thought about this current hot topic \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that the live streamer Ah Yu would actually be a goddess-like school flower. It\u2019s incredible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, why does she hide her face, even if she is this beautiful? All this while, I believed that Ah Yu would not want to reveal her face because she was ugly. What a lapse in my judgment\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really a super genius, live streaming had not affected her studies at all. She\u2019s always in the top three positions for all her exams! She\u2019s even in one of the best high schools in the country!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOut of all the female live streamers, Ah Yu is definitely something new. I actually hope that Ah Yu will stop live streaming for a while, maybe continue when she gets into university..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I the only one who thinks she is the Chu Luoxun in the real world? Those violin skills of hers are overwhelmingly remarkable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are really thinking too low of Ah Yu, or I should say Zhao Youyue. Do not forget her gaming talents. She\u2019s the best LoL player in the country and can easily beat any professional player! Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t play professionally. Otherwise, she would flip the Korean players over effortlessly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me; I just want to know if Ah Yu has a boyfriend, and whether she has been in a relationship before. She\u2019s only in her second year of high school, probably not, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the school flower, dimwit; boys are the rats to her pied pipe. She must have been in a relationship before!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! I can\u2019t hear anything! I won\u2019t listen to anything you guys say!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

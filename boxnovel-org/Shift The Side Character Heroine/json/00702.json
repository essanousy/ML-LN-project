Then, she realized that the Skellige Isles had been allowed to thrive in peace. There was also the Scoia\u2019tael of the Queen of the Elves, Francesca\u2026</p><br/><p>The only reason why she had taken notice of these two insignificant forces was because she had built Gwent decks based on their factions.</p><br/><p>Francesca did not dare oppose the Empress Regnant. She had promptly offered her surrender. Olivia had then handled the \u201cMinority Gathering Area\u2019 with much proficiency. She would grant it the freedom of self-rule.</p><br/><p>In the end, the Skellige Isle was the only country left in the entire continent that was considered an independent nation\u2026</p><br/><p>The leader of the Skellige Isles, King Bran, and Queen Calanthe, the \u201cLioness of Cintra,\u201d who had taken shelter there were both at a loss!</p><br/><p>Originally, the Second Northern War between the Nilfgaardian Empire and the Northern Kingdoms\u2019 had inflicted heavy losses on all parties involved. In the end, there were no winners, only losers.</p><br/><p>Many Kingdoms in the North became estranged. Gaps have started to show in the flaws.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Emperor Emhyr was miserable. The only reason why he could suppress the rebellions in his country in the past was with his victories in the First Northern War, where many people were stunned by his brilliant show of power in the war\u2026</p><br/><p>However, when the Second Northern War started, things went badly for him. In the beginning, the Nilfgaardian Empire still held strong. Unfortunately, most of their generals fell in combat. They had even used the Gwent deck against their enemies. It had 10 combat points and a \u201chealing\u201d technique. It was one of the strongest Gwent cards, comparable even to Olivia\u2019s Gwent deck. However, even the finest generals fell. The Empire might have lost more than they could possibly take.</p><br/><p>Olivia could conquer the entire continent with such ease, only due to the losses suffered by the dominant forces in the continent. Who knows, time would heal their wounds, and a third big war might kick off.</p><br/><p>However, Olivia\u2019s dominant showing had brought peace to the entire continent. She had unified the continent and became the sole Empress Regnant in this vast continent!</p><br/><p>There was only one last step in her path of becoming an Empress Regnant. It was to make the independent nation of the Skellige Isles surrender to her.</p><br/><p>However, even the cold Olivia could not bring herself to invade the Skellige Isles. The island had been nothing but kind and friendly to her. She had even spent her childhood on the island. There was also a Prince Hjalmar who she could never forget. He was almost a brother to her.</p><br/><p>When the Kingdom of Cintra was being invaded, Prince Hjalmar had even brought his own forces to help the Kingdom of Cintra resist the invasion by the Nilfgaardian Empire. However, his help was too little too late\u2026</p><br/><p>Prince Hjalmar could only repeatedly plunder the coasts of the Nilfgaardian Empire to vent his anger towards the Empire. At the same time, he wanted to stand up for Olivia.However, his reckless behavior was frowned upon by the nobles in the isles. They felt that he was looking for trouble by inciting strife between the Skellige Isles and the Nilfgaardian Empire.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the Empire was not interested in the barren islands. If not, with the Nilfgaardian Empire\u2019s navy, even the Skellige Isles\u2019 men might not amount to much.</p><br/><p>Those who hated the war were more supportive of Hjalmar\u2019s sister. They felt that she was a more suitable person when it came to bringing prosperity to the island. They did not have confidence in a meat-headed, reckless man who did all he could to provoke the powerful Emperor.</p><br/><p>However, their fears were now assuaged. Nilfgaard has fallen. Of course, the Empire\u2019s citizens did not feel that their country, as the strongest country on the continent, had truly been destroyed. The country carried a new name; its throne carried a new ruler\u2026 No big deal. Empress Regnant Olivia had unified the entire continent, so the entire continent is the Nilfgaardian Empire!</p><br/><p>Everyone now knew of Olivia\u2019s abilities. She was the perfect ruler. And now, she and Cirilla\u2019s daughter \u2013 Artoria bore all her regal markings.</p><br/><p>This talented genius child was already dreaming of becoming the perfect king since birth. She was just like her \u2018father,\u2019 Her Majesty Empress Olivia.</p><br/><p>Of course, Artoria looked up to her \u2018mother\u2019 Cirilla as well. Therefore, as she was looking forward to being a perfect king, at the same time, she hoped to learn the art of swordplay from her \u2018mother\u2019.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, Olivia tuned out her emotions. She left Skellige Isles with an ultimatum. They could either surrender or be destroyed.</p><br/><p>The Empress Regnant sent the nobles in the Skellige Isles trembling in fear. Olivia had already consolidated all of the warships in the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire. At the same time, she was backed by weapons that did not even seem like belongs in this world. How would the brainless meatheads in the Skellige Isle be supposed to defend themselves from Olivia?</p><br/><p>Based on the trend, traitors should start making their appearances at this point. They would attempt to appeal to Olivia\u2019s rationality. Well, she did have the right to succeed the Skellige Isles. Her earlier act of recognizing Crach as her father, or in other words, as the granddaughter of Queen Calanthe, gave her a stake in the claim over the Skellige Isles. Even though it was a weak claim, she still had Hjalmar as her brother.Still, what claim would the Empress Regnant need? If anything, that weak claim was a good reason to wage war!</p><br/><p>As Olivia unified the continent, she did not know how much of a problem she was causing to the continent\u2019s jurisprudence\u2026</p><br/><p>The Skellige Isles surrendered without much resistance. The old King Bran lacked the spine to resist Olivia. Calanthe, who used to think little of Olivia did not know whether to cry or laugh.</p><br/><p>Originally, Calanthe had thought that Olivia\u2019s only redeeming trait was her beautiful appearance. It would be the best for her as a bargaining chip through marriage. Yet now, the entire world was beneath her feet!</p><br/><p>On the day when the Empress Regnant visited the isles, Calanthe could only bow down in reverence to her granddaughter\u2026</p><br/><p>What a twist of fate!</p><br/><p>Just like this, Olivia\u2019s quest as Empress Regnant was complete. Following that, she received a new quest. The world was about to face an invasion from \u2018otherworldly beings.\u2019 Their target was Cirilla.</p><br/><p>Olivia decided to retreat from the Source World. Something like a monster\u2019s invasion was nothing much for a ruler of the world.</p></div>\n</div>"}

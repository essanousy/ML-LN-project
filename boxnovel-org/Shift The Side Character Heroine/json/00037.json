He then saw a Wechat message notification popped up on his phone, \u201cI\u2019m going back today\u2026\u201d Meanwhile, Liu Sha who had appeared beside him was gazing at his face.</p><br/><p>At last, Yang Ming still brought Liu Sha back to his home. That place called home, was no longer that in which he lived together with his sister. Ever since he opted for staying with Li Xiaodan, he had been separated with her. Thus, Yang Xixi was now living together with Xu Jing.</p><br/><p>Before wrapping up the story, Su Li had perfectly portrayed the yuri relationship between Yang Xixi and Xu Jing. It was so beautiful and harmonious. Some readers had even visioned that, Yang Ming\u2019s betrayal was completely acceptable, as long as Yang Xixi and Xu Jing could be together forever. Tons of female readers who had penchant for yuri had joined the party as well, but not for the scumbag hero of course. They were here for the innocent and delightful yuri plots.</p><br/><p>When Yang Ming reached home, he discovered the kitchen was in a huge mess all over the floor. A disgusted look instantly showed on his face. He could do nothing but to clean up the entire mess.</p><br/><p>Just as he was done with cleaning, the doorbell rang. He rushed out from the kitchen just to hear a crisp sound of face-slapping. Ah, it seemed that Li Xiaotong who possessed an ultimate six sense had returned to Yang Ming\u2019s house. After noticing the door was opened by Liu Sha, out of fury, she slapped Liu Sha\u2019s face viciously!</p><br/><p>Upon seeing Yang Ming, with an agitated face, she bawled, \u201cWhy is this shameless b*tch here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Ming was flurried, \u201cXiao Tong, why did you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat why? I\u2019m asking why would you rather be with her!\u201d Li Xiaotong yelled at Yang Ming while pointing at Liu Sha.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 This is\u2026\u201d Yang Ming faltered.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away Liu Sha! Stop pestering Ah Ming!\u201d Li Xiaotong almost pushed the silent Liu Sha out of the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh come on, Xiaotong!\u201d Yang Ming hurriedly pushed Li Xiaotong away, and stood in front of Liu Sha.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do wrong? What kind of relationship is this? I\u2019m pregnant with your baby! How could you do this to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Ming, you don\u2019t love Liu Sha anymore, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me you didn\u2019t ask her to come. She did all of this on her own. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSha\u2026 Shasha she did nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t! Liu Sha, you\u2019re the one who asked him to bring you home, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Li Xiaotong turned to question Liu Sha, \u201cGo away! You go away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Sha who had remained silent finally countered, \u201cAren\u2019t you the one who seduced brother Ming? Li Xiao Tong! You thought of taking my brother Ming away just by doing that to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Ah Ming and I love each other for real. We are soulmates since we were kids!\u201d Li Xiaotong said aloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just your wishful thinking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! Stop your nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m unlike you, I\u2019m generous. To me, it\u2019s common for a guy to have several girlfriends at once. How bad could it be? My dad has gotten three mistresses for himself too\u2026 For brother Ming, I\u2019ll be considerate\u2026\u201d Missy Liusha taunted her in a sarcastic and gentle tone. At the same time, she grabbed Yang Ming\u2019s hand and leaned on his chest, then looked into his eyes affectionately.</p><br/><p>Yang Ming was deeply moved by Liu Sha. He recalled the previous Liu Sha. She was a tsundere girl and often bit his head off. But now, she had changed so much for him. What was this if it wasn\u2019t love?</p><br/><p>Gazing at each other, their faces were getting closer and closer. Then they started kissing right in front of Li Xiaotong!</p><br/><p>At the sight of this unscrupulous duo, Li Xiaotong was crumbling. Little did she know that, this was exactly the feeling of Yang Xixi while catching her making out with Xixi\u2019s beloved brother. Sigh, another girl had fallen into the trap to this unfaithful hero\u2026</p><br/><p>It was just that, this time the loser who ran away from Yang Ming\u2019s house was Li Xiaotong instead. She kept mumbling to herself, \u201cHow could this be? He said I\u2019m his whole world when we made love! I\u2019m the first girl he kissed. I\u2019m the first girl he slept with. I should be his first until the end! But why? How could it turn out to be like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong could not stop recollecting the memories during her days with Yang Ming. Eerily, the last to appear in her mind was the apathetic face of Xu Jing!</p><br/><p>That night, Li Xiaotong was almost sleepless. She was woken up by her phone\u2019s vibration. It was a Wechat message. Realizing the message sender was Yang Ming was akin to seeing a silver lining for her. She kept her hopes high while opening the message, but just to see such contents \u2014</p><br/><p>Shasha will introduce you a good hospital which she knows well. The earlier you abort the baby, the lesser pain your body will suffer.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong looked at this Wechat message incredulously. Holding her tummy, she went down in the dumps.</p><br/><p>Quite the contrary, Yang Ming continued to attend school normally, as if nothing had happened. He actually felt that he had taken a load off his mind. Just as he stepped into the classroom, a Wechat message was sent by Li Xiaotong \u2014 I\u2019ve something to tell you face to face. Let\u2019s go to your house, just the two of us.</p><br/><p>Finally, Yang Ming cracked a relieved smile. It occurred to him that Li Xiaotong would willingly abort the baby. He even shared this happy news with Liu Sha. He rejoiced, \u201cToday onwards, I would always be together with my dearest Shasha. In my eyes, there would only be Shasha, forever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The couple again kissed on a whim.</p><br/><p>From a nearby lonely corner, Yang Xixi was staring wistfully at her brother who was amid kissing. After that, She hugged Xu Jing who was beside her, and kissed her lips aggressively. Xu Jing naturally responded to her kiss with an intense enthusiasm. In fact, she was reconciled to be the substitute for Yang Ming as everything was happening accordingly to her script. Once Yang Ming was gone, Yang Xixi would belong to her forever, wouldn\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>Not until the twilight, Yang Ming met Li Xiaotong in his house. He was sitting there, and questioned with expectations, \u201cSo how? Made up your mind? You gotta believe Shasha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong looked down, smiling. Her eyes looked incredibly sombre now. After remaining speechless for a long while, Yang Ming started to be on pins and needles. He broke the silence, \u201cLet me make you some tea\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do that.\u201d Li Xiaotong croaked. Then she leisurely walked to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Yang Ming frowned and lamented. He could feel that Li Xiaotong still was not into the idea of child abortion. What a headache! It seemed that he had to contemplate a way to convince her with his signature \u201ctenderness and kindness\u201d.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong was standing in the kitchen. Her eyes were suddenly caught by a rubbish bag filled with food waste. These were all the dishes she had purposely cooked for Yang Ming. Covering her mouth, her eyes seemed to be overflowed with sadness. She took out her phone and sent Yang Ming such a message, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Yang Ming was puzzled at reading the peculiar message, Li Xiaotong popped up behind him with a kitchen knife in her hand. Argh! Yang Ming was stabbed viciously on the back!</p><br/><p>Yang Ming fell backwards laying on the ground. Li Xiaotong sat on his body and held the knife tightly between her two hands. Then, she continued to stab him, again and again. Each and every attack brought back to her a piece of sweet memories she once had with Yang Ming. She cried aloud, \u201cYou\u2019re so cruel! Don\u2019t you ever think of living happily with Liu Sha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The body was horribly wounded!</p><br/><p>The blood splattered in all directions!</p><br/><p>The scene greatly satisfied the audience!</p><br/><p>A grimace of extreme pain had contorted Yang Ming\u2019s face. He goggled at Li Xiaotong in total disbelief. Never could he have thought that, she would do something like this!</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong stabbed Yang Ming continuously, until he was utterly dead, in a pool of blood\u2026</p><br/><p>Back to reality, Su Li was smiling arrogantly and breathing heavily; her paintbrush was flying across the draft papers in madness. Meanwhile, her manga work office was playing a japanese song named \u201cKanashimi no Mukou e\u201d. This is pretty much a niche song. At first, it was supposed to be the interlude song of a game, but the game was cut off in the middle. Some corporate executives had arbitrarily reckoned that this game would induce losses to the company, yet arouse uproars among the gamers.</p><br/><p>\u201cKanashimi no Mukou e\u201d \u2014</p><br/><p>\u3057\u307f\u306e\u3053\u3046\u3078\u3068,\u308a\u3051\u308b\u306a\u3089 (If I can make my way to the other side of sorrow)</p><br/><p>\u306f\u3082\u3046\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3088,\u306c\u304f\u3082\u308a\u3082\u3082 (Then I don\u2019t need warmth or tomorrow anymore)</p><br/><p>\u306e\u306b,\u3044\u308a\u305f\u306f (The dream that landed in the darkness of silence)</p>\n</div>"}

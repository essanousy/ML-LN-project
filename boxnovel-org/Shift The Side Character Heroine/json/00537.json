Everyone enjoyed themselves very much, and a small group had more or less been successfully formed. Everyone exchanged numbers. It would be reasonable to invite each other for meals and entertainment.</p><br/><p>After that, Zhao Youyue and He Weiwei went back to the dormitory together. This was the first time Zhao Youyue had ever stayed in a female dormitory. It was a new experience for her. She considered the conditions to be somewhat tough. The beds on campus were hard and stuffy.</p><br/><p>Han Leng could not wrap his mind around her staying on-site either. Wasn\u2019t the Lady bringing needless hardship upon herself?</p><br/><p>Han Leng had no inspiration to gain from living in a dormitory \u2013 he had been living that way since junior high. This male dormitory on campus was not very different, apart from being able to communicate with each other, gaming together\u2026</p><br/><p>If you wanted that experience, you could always drop by the cybercafe. The cybercafes around the campus were the atmospheric battlefields. Some students only considered laptop gaming as a last resort. If you wanted a wholesome experience, cybercafes provided powerful machines, complete with super fast refresh-rate curved monitors.</p><br/><p>Han Leng could see many more methods of making more friends. Males flocked to him, just like females did to Lady Zhao. Girls loved to play with Zhao Youyue. Boys certainly loved to play with Han Leng just as much.</p><br/><p>Even the great loner Du Hang was somewhat interested in Han Leng as well.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue returned to her dormitory, she found Zhao Cai still lost in her gaming world. Such hardcore female gamers were rare.</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei was flat on her back, watching some drama series on her tablet. The whole room was actually rather harmonious. They had even shut each other out with their respective earphones.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was pleased. This was how a dormitory should be. Why did they have to be so hostile towards each other\u2026?</p><br/><p>Very soon, Zhao Youyue started to experience the inconvenience of staying in the dormitory. She had grown up soaking herself in bathtubs. Now, which dormitory would provide a bathtub?</p><br/><p>She further learned that there was no hot water available. She would have to fetch hot water using a thermos by herself. Of course, water wasn\u2019t free either. A campus card was required.</p><br/><p>Male students could probably stand like statues and let the cold water wash over them. Lady Zhao much preferred hot water.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue tried to tell herself that this was a form of training for her. Of course, if she found it too difficult, she could very well switch on the \u201cXu Jing card.\u201d To Xu Jing who had been raised in poverty, this place may very well be heaven.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue chose to soldier on. She activated Xu jing and got her through the first day. She even offered some advice to He Weiwei during the process \u2013 who was also staying in the dormitory for the first time. This had certainly increased He Weiwei\u2019s favorability towards her.</p><br/><p>However, some little misunderstandings occurred along the way. He Weiwei truly considered Zhao Youyue to be a girl from an impoverished family. Not only she did not look down on Zhao Youyue; she felt that Zhao Youyue was truly incredible. She intended to learn much from Zhao Youyue\u2026</p><br/><p>Before going to sleep, classmates from another dormitory stopped by Zhao Youyue\u2019s dormitory. All four of them were from the same room. They seemed to have clicked together well, unlike Zhao Youyue\u2019s warzone of a dormitory.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue and He Weiwei welcomed them in. The other two did not seem interested in knowing more of their classmates.</p><br/><p>That was alright Zhou Cai. She could not be bothered about interpersonal communications. In addition to playing hardcore Single-Player games, she was also playing the online game \u201cJX 3\u201d. She was a lady boss player within the game, and the Goddess within the heart of many male players \u2013 even though she often insisted that she looked nothing like her avatar.</p><br/><p>Such a statement had misled into thinking that she was not just a Goddess \u2013 she was a modest, humble Goddess. However, if male players ever saw her appearance in real life, they would truly be disappointed. She was not modest, she was just truthful.</p><br/><p>Girls truly need the appearance attribute in this world. Beautiful female gamers would be totally moe. It was just like the character \u201cHimouto! Umaru-chan\u201d. Otherwise, they would just be miserable otakus.</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei was too lazy to get off her bed and say hello to those visitors. She did not deem them necessary in her quest of being class rep.</p><br/><p>Perhaps if she volunteered herself by then, many would agreed\u2026</p><br/><p>She had earned this spot back in high school. No one else dared to volunteer themselves, so the position basically flew into her hands. After that, she could offload just about everything to her vice class rep, and enjoy her leisurely position.</p><br/><p>This was how leaders functioned. Let the ones under your command do your job while taking their credits in the process. Offload the blame to them. Your minions are numerous, and they could share the brunt. As a leader, how could any of the flames even lick her toes?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue and He Weiwei committed these new faces to memory. The female students seemed to like the passerby Zhao Youyue. She was so gentle and lovable. She was the perfect friend.</p><br/><p>He Weiwei was not as popular as Zhao Youyue. After all, she had indeed enjoyed the limelight today, at the cost of her fellow females.</p><br/><p>Also, He Weiwei had apparently let it slip that she had just returned from dinner with Han Leng. In an understatement, she had said that Han Leng was not hardly as approachable as the media described, nor as cold. He had been a most gracious host who footed the bill.</p><br/><p>He Weiwei certainly knew why Han Leng was not cold. It was all thanks to the old deskmate Zhao Youyue. However, she had worded things, as if Han Leng favored her.</p><br/><p>This suppressed the arrogant attitude of the four classmates. One of them seemed to get awfully uncomfortable, as she was the girl who took the initiative to invite Han Leng for dinner and ended up being blatantly rejected. She had claimed to be one of his biggest fans, and truly loved his words. She had repeatedly read \u201cBeautiful April\u201d countless of times\u2026</p><br/><p>However, all of that had been pointless. Han Leng was inexplicably skillful at rejecting proactive girls.</p><br/><p>He Weiwei successfully raised herself on a pedestal. She could enjoy that position, at the cost of her peers. More rumors about her might spread, involving words like \u201cb*tch,\u201d \u201cvixen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue surveyed the scene with a keen eye. She had no opinions of her own to offer \u2013 to each her own methods.</p><br/><p>He Weiwei was the kind of person who treated those who were pleasing in her eyes favorably while despising the others.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Her charisma came along with her beautiful face. With a gorgeous figure to boot, she was the \u201cgoddess\u201d in everyone\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Her work was closely related to anime, games, and comics, yet one could never tell from the way she dressed. Perhaps some of Lady Zhao\u2019s fashion sense had rubbed off her.</p><br/><p>Every friend that Zhao Youyue cared about would be transfigured into Prince Charmings or Goddesses. Han Leng and Bai Yunshan were one of the lucky ones. They were not born handsome or pretty, but Lady Zhao could not sit idly by and not have them the way she liked. Everything around her had to be beautiful.</p><br/><p>Su Li was the only friend that did not require much improvements on Zhao Youyue\u2019s part. As long as she stayed the way she was, her pure and innocent looks would remind every man of their first crush in high school. As time went by, age was still gentle on her features.</p><br/><p>Perhaps she had yet to face the pressure of life. She did not have to slog and kill for survival. Her income from her drawings was more than enough to support her living. After her graduation, she produced \u201cPure Romance.\u201d With Zhao Youyue\u2019s support, she became a god-level author, well-known among the circle of Animation, Comic, and Games.</p><br/><p>However, Su Li was not particularly creative. Everybody knew that she took a leaf, or many leaves rather from multiple sources and reshaped them to suit her needs. Even so, they could not accuse her of anything, for over her shoulder, Zhao Youyue would have her eyes locked upon them.</p><br/><p>Such authors were the favorite targets for advertising companies or big corporations. As long as their work wasn\u2019t bad, most of it could be turned into profit, sucking more cash out of their fans.</p><br/><p>Not every novel or manga needed to be an icon. They only needed promotions and advertisements. With a good reputation, anyone could be manufactured into a God-level author.</p><br/><p>No matter what novel or manga a God level author produced, there would always be a group of fans praising the author\u2019s work. Whether it was overrated or not, the rates were there, regardless.</p><br/><p>Su Li was such an example. She only had her one \u201cPure Romance,\u201d and it was enough. As for \u201cThe Strongest King,\u201d well, it was originally written by Rosemary. Su Li was merely the illustrator.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s fans were well aware of her skills and weakness. Most of the time, they praised her for her beauty and drawing technique. Since she was recently spending more time with Lady Zhao, her fashion sense had changed from a university student into a matured model. That brought her charm to another level!</p><br/><p>Whenever Zhao Youyue and Su Li went shopping together in a mall, people often thought that two wealthy goddesses had appeared in their shops, and they were about to spend, big-time. You never see such pure charm among their peers.</p><br/><p>Money could buy beauty. With plastic surgery, health care, and treatment, one could increase one\u2019s charm exponentially. All this could only be acquired with a large amount of money.</p><br/><p>Su Li always thought that Lady Zhao was the one treated like a goddess by others. Little that she know that she was a goddess herself as well. Most guys could not resist looking at her\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue never had any nasty intentions towards Su Li. She was probably the most addicted player towards \u201cPaper People\u201d [1]. Her interaction with Paper People was real and actually took place in another dimension, while others could only express their love and thoughts to these Paper People in their dreams.</p><br/><p>That worked for Zhao Youyue. Such perfect love could only exist in Anime, Games or Novels. No such girl existed in reality. She would never get the extra mile to convert any girl into lesbianism.</p><br/><p>Few girls caught Zhao Youyue\u2019s eye. Plus, normal relationships involved men and women. Zhao Youyue was not just special. She was special among other special girls. She could not simply force other girls to be hers. That was just too reckless.</p><br/><p>Nobody could ever understand how much stress lesbians faced in their lives. They could never differentiate between love and sisterhood.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Zhao Youyue saw Su Li as her best friend. Other than being a great mentor, Su Li treated her warmly and gently. More sincerely than most, perhaps.</p><br/><p>It all started with Su Li wanting to get near Lady Zhao for her wealth, and the related connections that would give her a lot of privileges\u2026</p><br/><p>As time passed, she changed her perception towards Lady Zhao. Perhaps it was due to her hollow heart, or her desperate need for a friend to support her mentally. Su Li had always been passive towards her family. She felt so insignificant, and so raised a wall around her to prevent herself from being hurt by the outside world. Nobody understood her, only her manga did. That was why she chose to draw as a career. She knew that it was the only thing she could rely on.</p><br/><p>Relationship? It had nothing to do with effort. Most people pursued their loved ones. Most of the time, it only resulted in a larger gap between them and their loved ones. If they were meant to be together, they only needed to introduce themselves to one another and live happily ever after.</p><br/><p>Su Li enjoyed the times she spent with Lady Zhao. They were so close to each other. She never needed to act any differently around her.</p><br/><p>At that moment, both of them were lying on the same bed after a bath. Su Li was lost in her thoughts, thinking of all the moments she had with Lady Zhao. Suddenly, her head was filled with the time when she first met Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>She had been so confused, so puzzled. Was this not the protagonist of her manga, Xu Jing?</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao\u2019s fragrant scent drifted over to her. Mustering a tremendous amount of courage, she turned over and went on top of Lady Zhao. With a hand on either side and her long hair flowing over her neck, Su Li gazed down at the surprised Lady Zhao. She felt a burning desire surging through her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Li, what are you doing?\u201d Zhao Youyue acted innocently. That innocence only fueled the fire within Su Li.</p><br/><p>Su Li was suddenly attracted to Zhao Youyue juicy, pink lips. She was about to erupt, something was going to explode at this rate!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1]Paper People \u201c\u201d, was one of the nicknames given to the character of the game \u201cLove &amp; Producer\u201d, known as \u201c\u201d (Li\u00e0n Y\u01d4 Zh\u00ec Zu\u00f2 R\u00e9n) in its native name, is a Chinese dating sim and visual novel app, developed by Paper Games and published by NIKKI.

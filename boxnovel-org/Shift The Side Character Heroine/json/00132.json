Even if Zhao Youyue decides to provide a helping hand, the higher-ups have already decided to put an end to it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could actually become a side character and exit the realm when the literary work ends, but she was not planning on doing so, and remained to wreak more havoc instead. From a different perspective, her actions were only providing more ridiculous ideas and inspirations to the director, Lin Jianzhong.</p><br/><p>At the end of it, Zhao Youyue could only assure herself, that she was helping out this amateur director, Lin Jianzhong, who wanted to make an impression with his war films.</p><br/><p>This was no chicanery. Lin Jianzhong actually wanted to remove all the ridiculous contents from his drunken self, but after Lin Jianzhong was informed that his work was now coming to an end, boldness overtook his sanity!</p><br/><p>Why don\u2019t he just put all these ridiculous ideas to the screen, anyway?</p><br/><p>Since he was only left with two more episodes, his original plans were now really in ruins. Just because his work lacked a few, highly specific traits, the remaining interesting scenes could no longer be filmed\u2026</p><br/><p>To be honest, if he was not in his \u201cintoxicated state\u201d, he would have just given up on himself, feeling lost and unable to film the last two episodes. This movie would conclude with a half-*ssed, disillusioned ending.</p><br/><p>The consequences of a crappy ending would be, no one would ever know of this drama right from the beginning up till the end, and his unappreciated efforts would go to waste.</p><br/><p>Now, he realized that this ending could potentially turn this disaster into a cult favorite, if he makes his move wisely.</p><br/><p>Of course, such a heavily drug-addled work would not be something to be proud of. It was somehow akin to running naked on the streets to attract attention, or getting someone like Zhao Youyue, who had no sense of presence to suddenly jump up to the stage and beat up a teacher. Nevertheless, such methods would always cause an uproar!</p><br/><p>As short-lived as such methods would be, some netizens would even frame it inside their private halls of shame. But then, his drama had remained unknown ever since its premiere, so of course, Lin Jianzhong was not highly dissatisfied with this situation!</p><br/><p>He was disappointed with the current entertainment era. Indeed, he was pretty serious when it came to filming this war film, wasn\u2019t he, why couldn\u2019t anyone appreciate it?</p><br/><p>He wanted to cause an uproar to exact his vengeance on society!</p><br/><p>He wanted to prove his own existence, to make himself known throughout history!</p><br/><p>Now, he could only show it in a different way\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Jianzhong himself knew all too well that this \u201cinspired mode\u201d produce ideas that were ludicrous and out of the world. However, in terms of creativity, it would definitely surpass all trending war films. He even believed that some other war films in the future would be inspired by his creation\u2026</p><br/><p>After wrestling with himself for a bit, Lin Jianzhong, who soon relented to himself, handed in the ridiculous script to his actors. He did not even bother considering if his \u201cfive-year-old\u201d actress could play out the role.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Lin Jianzhong had given up all hope. In his mind, these final two episodes were going to be a mess, so who cares if the actor\u2019s put their backs to it or not?</p><br/><p>Ratings were disastrous, the entire cast was low in morale, everyone was expecting this drama to fail and had left the sinking ship to its fate.</p><br/><p>This \u201cfive-year-old\u201d actress was the daughter of one of the actors, her name was Li Yunyun, and she was just an ordinary girl. She only had two or three scenes originally, and her character would be killed off in the next episode, after getting hit by a stray bullet. So, she was rather shocked when she received her extensive lines, and turned to her dad who was also an actor, asking if something had gone wrong with Director Lin\u2019s brain\u2026</p><br/><p>Her dad Li Yun felt especially happy for her, \u201cWho cares if he\u2019s lost it, it\u2019s a good thing that you got so many scenes, can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Understandably, Li Yunyun was a little uneasy, being only five years old. Even though she was rather mature for her age due to her single-parent upbringing, she was totally new to this role. She would not have become involved with acting if not for her dad. Seeing that she was originally planned out to be this side character little girl who had only two or three appearances on screen, of course, she could do it, anyone would be able to step up to it.</p><br/><p>But now that little girl was possessed by the brave soul of \u201cLi Yunlong\u201d, and having no clue as to who this \u201cLi Yunlong\u201d was, she had zero clues on how to act like one. A patriotic, heroic spirit, would be challenging, even for an adult.</p><br/><p>Still, Li Yunyun decided to accept the role, because she knew that her dad would force her to agree, regardless of what she felt about it. What was the happiest thing for an actor? Of course, it would be getting more screentime, so why bother about the details?</p><br/><p>Of all the actors here, none of them were award-winning candidates. The lead roles of \u201cLiu Xing\u201d and \u201cLiang Feifan\u201d had some caliber. Still, they were relatively unknown, despite being full-fledged professionals, possessing pretty decent acting skills. However, their pay was slightly low, as of now, this was the era of handsome men. Owning a handsome face and lovestruck fans, were the solid foundations of an acting career.</p><br/><p>These professional actors had no objections towards Lin Jianzhong\u2019s new script. The actor who played the role of Liu Xing grinned to himself, \u201cEat this sh*t, Liang Feifan\u201d! He felt that he could finally release the anger of the hero that had been pent-up for a long time\u2026</p><br/><p>The actors were aware of this being the final two episodes, so they never bothered sweating over the details either. It was certainly best for everyone to end this flopping drama without incident.</p><br/><p>So, under strange circumstances, the cameras started rolling for the two final episodes of \u201cWar Heroes\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>The cameraman suddenly realized that when his camera was directed at Li Yunyun, who was supposed to play the role of \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d, he felt something click, as if he was being \u201cpossessed\u201d, he knew exactly how to film, all the way down to the angle and zooms required to capture \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d in her perfect form!</p><br/><p>The actress, Li Yunyun who was acting as \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d performed incredibly as well. She has never taken formal lessons before, but her performance was like that of an experienced actor, it even outshone the actors who played as Liu Xing and Liang Feifan!</p><br/><p>She eventually became a genius actress, becoming fully immersed in this \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d role!</p><br/><p>The strangest thing was, not a single blooper even occurred, the whole group was completely in sync, it was an astounding sight!</p><br/><p>The director, Lin Jianzhong rarely had to shout \u2018cut\u2019, because everyone was at their peak performance, as if they all had the same visualizations of these scenes\u2026and knew just what the director wanted</p><br/><p>So, \u201cWar Heroes\u201d was done filming in an extremely short amount of time, while editing took just as much, if not less effort! Even the awesome visual effects were completed, as the production staff who was in charge of the special effects were \u201cpossessed\u201d too, and were performing at over 200% capacity. They were originally a second-rate special effects production team, but they were producing something that could have come from a major blockbuster!</p><br/><p>Next Thursday, these two episodes will be the grand finale of \u201cWar Heroes\u201d!</p><br/><p>Youku video web will also host these final two episodes at 12:00 AM, on the same day.</p>\n</div>"}

The nameless swordswoman, who was originally nothing more than a female side-character, had actually made the sales of the entire game skyrocket!</p><br/><p>Of course, the game already had a good reputation, to begin with. Perhaps, a variety of cosplays involving this character would soon appear</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su was getting highly popular for a character who had not even been featured or talked about in his interviews. Moreover, because more and more players were falling into the pit, her popularity only had one direction to go \u2013 up. With just a little push, she would become an icon!</p><br/><p>Only iconic characters could live in the minds of the players forever. As long as someone had personally bought the game and tried to get through it diligently, she would live in their memories forever.</p><br/><p>Of course, iconic games would not stop at single iconic characters. Instead, other similarly popular and important locations only served to enhance the power of the iconic character!</p><br/><p>A female character only had to look good to garner a male following. Many male players even claimed that the beauty of a female character played a part in their combat effectiveness. An ugly female character had to be insignificant and useless. Otherwise, they had to be side-kicks, or mini-bosses at most.</p><br/><p>Of course, iconic female villains also had to be good-looking. They needed that special kind of villainous beauty. Other than those cruel players who went full-ryona, slaughtering every beautiful girl they came across, which crime could not be solved with some sex?</p><br/><p>Forgiving and forgetting the past with angry sex was also a routine that many novel writers utilized. Of course, reality was not as colorful and as miraculous as novel worlds.</p><br/><p>Yan Qingmeng was far from a female villain. She was a righteous deity. She followed the way of the heavens. When players officially activate her questline, she would also leave some pretty good memories for them.</p><br/><p>It was just like where Wu Shun was at now \u2013 a long street in the capital city of the Kingdom of Zhao, which was filled with the beauty of spring. He was traveling on a horse, together with Yan Qingmeng who was wearing a plain robe. Suddenly, there came the spring rain. The view was most enchanting; they were lovers under the rain. It was just like a dream.</p><br/><p>Then, the two of them went to the eaves to hide from the rain, and the beautiful CG animation appeared once again. Under such circumstances, they looked into each other\u2019s eyes and saw their own reflections\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, wow, wow! Lady Yan Qingmeng is really so damn beautiful. Which professional artist did Old Sly Zha Feng hire to design her? Nobody could possibly resist this freaking goddess. Now, are you guys feeling what I\u2019m feeling, the impulse to go back to the time when I experienced my first love?\u201d Wu Shun was practically screaming into his microphone. His viewers enthusiastically agreed.</p><br/><p>They were as enthralled by Yan Qingmeng\u2019s charm, although she seemed somewhat conceited and distant. Afterall, she was a deity. So what if she was a little arrogant? She had quite a few lines, which blew over the breeze of spring over those who were listening to her\u2026</p><br/><p>Indeed, Yan Qingmeng was an eloquent orator. Even a player like Wu Shun was swayed by her diplomatic tongue. Deity Yan was wise and convincing. Her words were so inviting, that even the audience started to complain. Shouldn\u2019t she venture into direct sales? She would make a killing off it!</p><br/><p>The emotional chemistry between the player and Yan Qingmeng was very arty and invigorating, just like a beautiful CG movie. In the end, the two of them walked in the rain under an umbrella. It was here, beneath the umbrella where they embraced each other affectionately. Players who had gone down this questline would crow in delight!</p><br/><p>Of course, triggering such a CG to appear required a gargantuan amount of energy. Less-skilled players would truly struggle with this. Of course, for their goddess, they would be willing to die again and again. They might as well just sit back and wait for guides\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! How is this possible? The deity Yan somehow makes me think that the nameless swordswoman had actually approached me in the hope that she could make use of me? Sigh, my feelings are all messed up right now. Is it true that there\u2019s not even one good person in this world? Only the deity Yan is righteous\u201d Wu Shun said mournfully.</p><br/><p>In a sense, rather than saying that he had successfully pursued Yan Qingmeng, it was more of the other way round. His heart was bagged by the artistic and refreshing scene which depicted one\u2019s first love. It could not be helped. Hardcore otakus did not really have much experience when it came to love. Even games easily cheated on them!</p><br/><p>Moreover, all the evidence that Yan Qingmeng had put forward had been rock solid. Compared to the confident, outspoken Yan Qingmeng, the nameless swordswoman was extremely taciturn. She was also full of mystery. What\u2019s more, she was not flirty with men at all. Naturally, there was nothing much about her that could flutter the hearts of male players.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s use an inappropriate analogy. She was just like an \u201chonest person.\u201d Honest people could give others a feeling of warmth and safety, but they were too bland, and blunt at times. They were completely oblivious to the atmosphere around them and did not know anything about romance. Hence, honest people were the most well-suited for girls who were done with flirting around and have finally decided to settle down\u2026</p><br/><p>A woman like Yan Qingmeng that flirted so subtly that it was almost imperceptible \u2013 was on an entirely different level. She even surpassed the Green Tea Bitch from the real world. She could put in the least amount of effort to make men sacrifice their souls to her!</p><br/><p>This was probably a gift that had been bestowed upon the righteous deities\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu Shun completely fell for it. Rather than saying he had been tricked by Yan Qingmeng, it was more like him getting tricked by the good-for-nothing Old Sly Zha Feng. He had created at least three huge misunderstandings and had added many more misleading minor details.</p><br/><p>At the start, Wu Shun still maintained a modicum of guard against Yan Qingmeng. However, the more he advanced the plot and the more \u201cevidence\u201d he found through his secret investigations, he finally expressed his distress. He exclaimed that he did not expect the nameless swordswoman who had once saved him when he was on the brink of death to be an ambitionist, a conspirator, and a cultist. She had established the anonymous city. Many of the martial artists from the Kingdom of Zhao shiverred at the thought of that city. It was said the anonymous city had no system of its own, its inhabitants commited all form of evil, and they wanted to disrupt the balance of martial arts. Anybody would have the right to punish her!</p><br/><p>As for the people on the lower level of the community who thought that the people from the anonymous city were good people, they have, of course, been indoctrinated by the cult. Pitiful villagers, their biggest weakness was their low IQ!</p><br/><p>Wu Shun had figured it all out. The small boss that he had once killed before coming to the new map was also someone from the anonymous city. Everything made sense now!</p><br/><p>Indeed, the anonymous city was the root cause of all turmoil in the Kingdom of Zhao, and the owner of the anonymous city was none other than the calculative and pretentious swordswoman. This was absolutely heart-wrenching. In an attempt to treat her wounds, he had died countless times. In return, all he got was ruthless deception!</p><br/><p>At the same time, news about \u201cThe Duel\u201d between the owner of the anonymous city and the \u201cSword God\u201d Li Xiye had spread all over the country. Many martial artists have expressed that they wanted to watch this incredibly earth-splitting, decisive battle!</p><br/><p>Wu Shun carried out a series of investigations shortly before the Duel, to clarify the truth behind this decisive battle \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>The decisive battle was just a guise. The true target of the anonymous city\u2019s self-proclaimed ruler was none other than the Zhao King Su Hu!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

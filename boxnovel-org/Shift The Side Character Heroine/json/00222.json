After all, this was their very first time attending their daughter\u2019s provincial violin competition. The final results of this competition would certainly be useful for applying to a university or participating at a higher level of music competition.</p><br/><p>Its level of importance was not inferior to those provincial science competitions too. Besides, Zhao Youyue had decent grades herself, and if her achievements in classical music were to be added to that, she would definitely get the attention of famous schools.</p><br/><p>Not many people in the theatre, because most of them were the relatives of the contestants. This was not a concert, and it could get pretty boring. Many of the audiences were dozing off, for contestant after contestant was playing the same tune, it was monotonous!</p><br/><p>Ever since Su Li, Ye Hai, and Li Mengyao attended the last music competition, they swore never to come again. They always believed that these sorts of music competitions would be grand, but they had been greatly mistaken, because music competition and performances were two different things!</p><br/><p>Those who were capable of holding their own concerts undoubtedly had their own skill and charm, but those who participated in music competitions might be amateurs, and most of them were not qualified to perform in a concert, and some even participated for the sake of getting an extra curriculum credential.</p><br/><p>Only professional judges were able to withstand this dull performance, as they listened to every one of the contestant play, and gave them the scores that they deserved.</p><br/><p>At this very moment, Wang Hua was even more nervous than Zhao Youyue, she held her husband\u2019s hands tightly, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, my little sloth actually made it, she has upheld her promise ever since she started attending her violin classes again! Not only has she managed to get a grade ten in violin; she has even entered the finals in this music competition, she\u2019s definitely a talented musician! It\u2019s all your fault, if only you had insisted on her learning the violin when she was still young, she would probably be famous already, in the field of classical music!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hua actually wanted to say that she was her own \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d but she did not believe that her husband would understand a single word, because he has never read this popular romantic novel.</p><br/><p>The violin has twelve grades in total, and the highest an amateur could achieve is ten, while grade eleven was master level, and grade twelve was performance level. Normally, a person would spend seven to ten years to achieve to grade ten, but Zhao Youyue had only spent a few months to get the same results, wasn\u2019t she talented?</p><br/><p>Of course, this was because Zhao Youyue had been possessing \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d frequently over the past few months. Although she had not gotten the character card of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d yet, she was already in sync with \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was addicted to music in her own literary world, and she even goes up on stage to perform, teaching Lin Meiyue violin lessons. Indirectly, Zhao Youyue was improving her own violin skills as well.</p><br/><p>To be able to enter a literary world to live another life was an experience worth treasuring, the process was far more satisfying than the results.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi only smiled as he was listening to Wang Hua\u2019s complaints, he would have never expected his daughter to be this outstanding!</p><br/><p>He was already proud of his daughter\u2019s academic results, and now, her violin skills had improved drastically as well, where was all this mysterious power coming from?</p><br/><p>What happened to his daughter who was ordinary in every aspect?</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi felt sorry for his daughter, did she overwork herself and struggle through unspeakable hardships to achieve such results?</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi was right on point, the reason behind the drastic improvement in music was because Zhao Youyue had experienced everything \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had been through, be it her happiness, sadness, and sufferings. There is a saying, \u201cThe road to success is not easy to navigate, but with hard work, drive and passion, it\u2019s possible to achieve the American dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>This character, by far was the character that Zhao Youyue had spent the most time on, and of course, she had deep feelings for her.</p><br/><p>In fact, Chu Luoxun was considered as the most important side character or even the main heroine in this particular novel. The previous iconic characters like \u201cXu Jing\u201d or \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d had significantly lesser appearances in their respective novels, but not Chu Luoxun, her appearance in the novel was on par with the main heroine, Lin Meiyue, and you can find her appearing in almost every chapter.</p><br/><p>Other than Zhao Youyue\u2019s parents, Han Leng too was at the theater; he was lurking about in one of the corners. He had thought that he had always given inaccurate descriptions of the atmosphere, mostly due to the fact that he had never been to one before, but surprisingly, it was quite accurate!</p><br/><p>It was no surprise that many of his readers who participated in music competitions before asked him if he was had once been involved in the field. If he was indeed one of them, they would probably know his identity, after all, the field of classical music was not that vast, and people would certainly recognize a genius like him immediately.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, who resolved herself to becoming a \u201cHumanoid Metronome\u201d in order to win the competition had already attracted a lot of attention to herself.</p><br/><p>What Han Leng did not expect was the size of the audience, they were so sparse. He would be deeply embarrassed if Zhao Youyue catches sight of him!</p><br/><p>If he is misunderstood by others, it would turn out even worse, he no longer had a crush on Zhao Youyue, because he had his own Goddess Chu!</p><br/><p>Whenever he is reminded that Mr. Qiu had swapped his place and had placed him beside Zhao Youyue, he would feel an immense headache. It would be best if he opposes this idea, because he was only close to Zhao Youyue in Wechat. In reality, he could not even speak ten words to her; it was extremely awkward. If it were not for the apology letter that Zhao Youyue had requested of Han Leng to write for her, they would not even know each other.</p><br/><p>Han Leng believed that he should only keep in touch with Zhao Youyue in Wechat. What if his \u201cinspiration\u201d comes pouring in during class and he starts writing, only to be discovered by his deskmate, Zhao Youyue? Will Zhao Youyue beat him to death because his identity of \u201cLeng Zi\u201d had been exposed?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the music competition finally started.</p><br/><p>There were less than twenty contestants, and Zhao Youyue was the sixth to go on stage.</p><br/><p>The content of this competition was to pick a song of your choice under a certain category, which was Mozart, and Zhao Youyue had picked a song title \u201cI Palpiti\u201d by N.Paganini, a flamboyant song that served well in showing off one\u2019s skills. In fact, her heart was as still as calm water as she performed, and without any distraction, she would become a doll, playing the two songs perfectly, fitting her title as the \u201cHumanoid Metronome.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the fourth contestant had already went on stage, Zhao Youyue started leaving her preparation room, only to discover a male violinist waiting for her in the corridor.</p><br/><p>When he saw Zhao Youyue coming out from her room, he headed toward her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you find the way you play the violin boring? Today, I\u2019ll show you what real music is!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

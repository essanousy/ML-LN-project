Now, Master PhD obviously had not yet truly begun the plot for the new apocalypse dungeon. Those who were familiar to Master PhD\u2019s writing style would know that she would always write a trail notice before the opening of the new dungeon. Whereas Zhang Yanwei was exactly the passerby character that appeared within the trailer. She was exactly the person who discovered the meteorite that fell onto the earth, bringing along the horrifying evolutionary virus\u2026</p><br/><p>But since it was an infinite style kind of work, after the end of a dungeon, a summary was always needed, listing all kinds of rewards, harvests, imagining the future. These were all the enjoyable points of an infinite style kind of work. As a business writer, Master PhD certainly would not give up such enjoyable points from writing.</p><br/><p>Therefore, before Master PhD wrote about Zheng Yanwei, Zhao Youyue could use this identity to make arrangement in advance within the literary world. Until the time when Master PhD entered intoxicated state when writing about \u201cZhang Yanwei\u201d again, she would definitely feel that this female scientist character was truly mysterious, to be having such a great suspense on herself. Until the moment when the suspense was unveiled, she would definitely give countless readers deep impression!</p><br/><p>Now, there were certainly some readers discussing the new characters within the trailer as well. But there were very few who discussed about the passerby indigene Zhang Yanwei. Many readers still paid their attention onto the members of Endless Squad. They wanted to see how they would save or destroy the world.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt that it was also quite nice that no one paid attention to Zhang Yanwei. Only such a plain and unsurprising character would be able to make a great coup during the crucial moment. Even the members of Endless Squad who were filled with sense of superiority would also be cheated by her. After all, she was a \u201creborn\u201d.</p><br/><p>Actually, Zhang Yanwei was not merely a reborn. She was a hack within the same high-dimensional world as Master PhD the \u201cGod Creator\u201d. No matter how great the cheat Master PhD applied to Chu Xuan, Zhang Yanwei would not be cheated by Chu Xuan. Zhao Youyue was completely able to find out Chu Xuan\u2019s overall arrangements through Master PhD in reality\u2026</p><br/><p>If Chu Xuan\u2019s cheat was a maphack, then Zhang Yanwei would be the person who created the cheat. She was always able to figure out Chu Xuan\u2019s arrangement in advance. Even the No.1 wise man like Chu Xuan was also unable to oppose the real cheat. Whereas the explanation Zhao Youyue gave could also make a fool of the past, which was that Zhang Yanwei was a \u201creborn\u201d, therefore she was completely able to see through everything.</p><br/><p>Master PhD spent about five days time and finally finished writing the excessive plot within the Lord God space. Then, she wrote that the Endless Squad came to the new apocalypse world. Chu Xuan the No.1 wise man entered the scene as a newcomer.</p><br/><p>Since there was such a super awesome person like Chu Xuan among the newcomers, there would certainly be the silly newcomers who were unclear about the situation, thinking that they were purely kidnapped. Then, there would have a bunch of people having a coordinate acting with the purpose to cheat their money. Such newcomers were simply as if they lived within dreams. If put within source world, they would obviously be cannon fodder of those people in the reality world after they had dreamt and came into the source world. Even if they died, perhaps that bunch of people within the reality world would not have any memory once they woke up.</p><br/><p>As expected from Chu Xuan, he used the style of a folk scientist which made people\u2019s admiration arose despite their comprehension of what he said, to directly fool Zheng Yi the leader of the Endless Squad. Zheng Yi almost intended to directly worship Chu Xuan as the army adviser. He certainly did not know how horrifying a wise man like Chu Xuan who could use everything as a chess piece when he became cold-blooded.</p><br/><p>Especially now that Chu Xuan had not yet been influenced by Zheng Yi the good bestie. He totally did not know about things like true partner, true friendship. Perhaps only after he had died once, he was then able to understand these things.</p><br/><p>Once the Endless Squad came, there would be three days left before the coming of apocalypse. They would certainly plan to search for a safe stronghold first. The mainline quest by Lord God was certainly to guarantee their own survival, and then to hunt and kill creatures that had evolved, making them into specimens to be retrieved by Lord God\u2026</p><br/><p>As for the ultimate quest to save the apocalypse, Lord God was actually just simply saying. It obviously did not consider that the human of this world could be saved. Those creatures that had evolved were truly too powerful. Not only they had powers, but they also had higher intelligence. Under such a circumstance, human would certainly be destined to be substituted!</p><br/><p>Soon, the members of Endless Squad realized that not knowing the reason, but the human of this world seemed to have figured out in advance that the apocalypse was coming. Therefore, they had actually begun to make preparation in advance. The atmosphere was drastically stirred up\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Zhang Yanwei the beauty scientist who originally appeared only within the trailer had officially entered the scene. So it was actually her who brought up the rhythm. Not knowing how she did, but she had directly established contact with the military. Perhaps it was related to her sudden explosion of inspiration, to have designed quite a dark technological weapon?</p><br/><p>Without any unexpectation, in reality, when Master PhD depicted Zhang Yanwei, she already felt her thoughts flowing easily. Truthfully speaking, Master PhD originally only knew how to write about folk scientist like Chu Xuan. It might be enough to cheat readers who did not know the ropes. But for those who truly conducted scientific researches, they obviously would feel that Master PhD was truly very good at bullshitting\u2026</p><br/><p>But Master PhD could not be fully blamed for this. She was just a professor who involved in social science. It was already considered very good for her to able to produce such a folk scientist who made people\u2019s admiration arose despite their comprehension of what he said. The requirement must not be too high.</p><br/><p>However, when she wrote about Zhang Yanwei the true beauty scientist, she was actually able to produce such professional sense. It was as if some hard sci-fi content had suddenly appeared within a soft sci-fi work!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yanwei\u2019s painting style was completely different from Chu Xuan\u2019s cheater-style. Zhang Yanwei was indeed beautiful. But when she got involved in scientific research, she was the very earnest type. She had also published countless influential journals. She was worthy of being called the \u201cMadame Curie\u201d of the current age. For such an influential star scientist to be starting a discussion about apocalypse all of a sudden, this would also certainly stir up a tiny hot issue of social concern.</p><br/><p>Under such a circumstance, some people who had been worrying about unrealistic stuffs, had actually begun to seriously prepare for the apocalypse instead. Especially for some who did not lack of money, they had even prepared a heavy truck, intending to forge it into a moving fortress during the apocalypse\u2026</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, although everyone was discussing passionately about the apocalypse, there were still too few people who truly put it into action. Whereas the reason Zhang Yanwei was able to stir up this issue not so abruptly, was because this year was 2012. As everyone knew that this year was the year of \u201capocalypse fever\u201d. Other than things like the \u201cMayan Prophecy\u201d, the Hollywood blockbuster \u201c2012\u201d had also played a great role in promoting.</p><br/><p>Whereas it was under such a circumstance, the night after three days, people saw a round of gorgeous meteor shower. Whereas this was the most beautiful scenery before the disaster stroke\u2026</p></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

It resembled his sister, but he did not know this creature. Still, he was starting to understand why Chen Yilong enjoyed sitting in Xia Hai\u2019s car. This sensation was amazing! His soul was flying through the air! The views on both sides of the mountain road were retreating like phantoms. This was something like those VR space shuttle simulators, except that this was far more realistic!</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao finally learned what drifting truly was. He could not decide if he enjoyed it more than he hated it. It was just a little too overly-stimulating. This car spent more time going sideways than straight. Modified cars were usually built to be as lightweight as possible. At such high speeds, the four wheels might just leave the ground\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Hao\u2019s nightmare reached a new height. Xia Hai\u2019s black modified car was faster on straight lines. That was fine. But how his sister caught up to him at the start of corners was terrifying. Whenever Xia Hai slammed on the brakes, she only seemed to accelerate even harder!</p><br/><p>Oh my God! That\u2019s a corner, don\u2019t you see it? Why aren\u2019t you slowing down? You\u2019re gonna kill us!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Hao was like a helpless little girl. He flattened himself against his seat and grabbed the sides. He had already accepted his fate, waiting to be raped\u2026</p><br/><p>In Xia Hai\u2019s car, Chen Yilong was very relaxed. But when he saw the grey-silver car looming behind, he could not help but exclaim, \u201cShe\u2019s actually accelerating. Isn\u2019t she afraid of flying off the mountain? Has she gone mad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Hai\u2019s eyes flashed momentarily. He said faintly, \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Hai took corners like a conventional racer. He ensured that the car maintained full traction at all times. His tires barely ever screeched, but he was still ridiculously fast, going up to 160km/h. His car\u2019s handling had been enhanced to the maximum. His tires guaranteed perfect cornering!</p><br/><p>The audiences observed the big screen. Some of them were eating fruits, drinking beverages. Some had even started off BBQ sessions.</p><br/><p>Qian Xiaojia\u2019s live stream gave about just as much information as the big screen. Some of her streams were the reason why adolescents were plagued by idle fantasies of mountain racing. They had even been misled into thinking that these mountain racers had too much free time in their hands. These modified cars were so much more interesting than those boring, standard racecars.</p><br/><p>When these passionate youths actually stepped into this world, they would soon discover how cruel it was. They had only seen the glamorous side of those racers who had made it, yet not learning of how many racers have accidentally died in car crashes!</p><br/><p>This was comparable to those extreme sports enthusiasts who loved high altitude parkour while taking selfies at the top of the Burj Khalifa. If they succeeded, it was a huge success. If they failed, it meant certain death!</p><br/><p>If Zhao Youyue did not have her cheat card, she would not even dream of getting into a car\u2026</p><br/><p>As the cars took the first bend, onlookers lost their minds!</p><br/><p>The grey-silver car tore the bend up. Many people had been prepared for the worst. Instead, the car had ferociously displayed its side to the road, drifting wildly. The tires screeched and tore up the tarmac. The tail of the car actually went over the side of the road. This was as extreme as a drift could get!</p><br/><p>Drifting in real life was usually slow and flashy. This theoretical but humanly impossible form of drifting pushed cars to the limits while taking corners with minimal loss in speed!</p><br/><p>At that moment, many brains stopped functioning. \u201cFlashy but useless\u201d drift? I\u2019ve been thinking it wrongly all this while! I need to unlearn and relearn this shit!</p><br/><p>After that gorgeous angle, Zhao Youyue\u2019s car did not just pull away from Xia Hai\u2019s car, but got closer instead!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck my life, she drifted, like for real!\u201d Chen Yilong had kept an eye on the side mirror. He was shocked. He could not help but sigh at the art in motion.</p><br/><p>Xia Hai was slightly miffed. He had never approved on drifting. He was a firm believer in the disciplined grip racing. It was a work of mathematical genius that involved precise calculations that took everything into account, from the apex of the corners, to the centrifugal forces at play. As the predator behind him closed in, he suddenly realized that drifting had its own merits.</p><br/><p>The most pitiful person was actually Zhao Hao. Onlookers may have thought that the car had looked amazing as it crabwalked. Zhao Hao felt as if he had just experienced the edge of life and death!</p><br/><p>Holy sh*t! This isn\u2019t fun at all! This is a nightmare! His sister is going to kill him!</p><br/><p>The inertia of his body had actually flung him to the left and right. He tightened his grip on the sides of the seat. Blood left his face. This car was not for humans! I\u2019m getting off, I\u2019m getting off this car, or my piss is going to get out of my bladder!</p><br/><p>Even so, Zhao Hao was a man. He truly respected his genius sister. Only she could turn a car into a space shuttle. Her guts, her skills, did they know no bounds?</p><br/><p>If Zhao Youyue knew that her cousin had such thoughts, she would definitely admit that she was actually without skill; she was all heart and instincts!</p><br/><p>Spectators thought that they were in for a surprise treat. This was bliss, this was art. They had expected a boring race, with a predictable outcome. They never expected the female racer in the grey-silver modified car to be this good. Xia Hai had actually failed to leave her in the dust. On the contrary, she was actually closing in on him like a predator!</p><br/><p>The crucial moment was nearing!</p><br/><p>It was a cold and windy night. On that dark, silent night, the silence was shattered by a wave of engine roars and tire screeches. Headlights tore through the dark mountain road that was barely wide enough for the width of two cars. This was the last corner. It was famous for its characteristic S-shape. After that, it would end in a straight sprint to the finish.</p><br/><p>A pure black car that had been modified to its limits entered the corner first. It was blindingly fast on the straights, but had slammed its brakes hard and decelerated to the ideal speed for the corner. The timing had been impeccable. This was enough for the machine to declare its victory.</p><br/><p>Xia Hai smiled faintly. At the very next moment, his lips parted in surprise. His poker face remained, but his body had betrayed his shock with a jolt of electricity.</p><br/><p>This race had given him far too many surprises. His palms were damp with sweat.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a haunting screech echoed in his ears. The grey-silver car, with its unassuming, almost stock body had never looked so beautiful before!</p><br/><p>As usual, Zhao Youyue had not slowed down. Instead, she had put the pedal to the metal while spinning the steering wheel. Her slim, perfect fingers were like phantoms. She drifted through the entire S-curve, shocking the daylights out of Xia Hai and Chen Yilong. A line of grey-silver lightning suddenly flashed past the S-curve. It screamed at them like a banshee as it zoomed past them!</p><br/><p>The victor had been determined!</p></div>\n</div>"}

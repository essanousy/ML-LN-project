She wanted to try all sorts of dishes to make herself happy.</p><br/><p>She would be in a bad mood when she is prevented from a delicious meal!</p><br/><p>But then, Zhao Youyue would dwell on such pettiness for long. She had entered the realm of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d once again.</p><br/><p>With the help of the main heroine, Lin Meiyue, Gu Yuan and \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d finally met up, and \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had appointed Gu Yuan to be her partner to perform music together. Even though she did not get the approval of the judges in the previous competition, by the recommendation of the audience, she had earned another chance to perform in the upcoming competition.</p><br/><p>Of course, Gu Yuan had rejected her request, because he was still held back by his past trauma. He could again hear the music when he starts to perform, but as he plays, the music would begin to fade away, and the more he concentrates, the lesser he would hear it. He might have a mental illness of \u201cbeing unable to hear any music in his peak form.\u201d</p><br/><p>But \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had insisted that Gu Yuan become her partner, and Lin Meiyue had supported the idea\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stood among the unique colors of spring,\u201d Gu Yuan was lost in his thoughts again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe designated song would be Saint Saens\u2019s \u2018Overture and Rotary Caprice,\u2019 I\u2019ll bring the music score here tomorrow.\u201d Chu Luoxun smiled and had already decided to drag Gu Yuan into her plan.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was supporting the idea as well, because she was a gentle and kind girl, plus she knew what trauma Gu Yuan had. She wanted Gu Yuan to overcome his trauma by becoming the partner of her new best friend \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d, who might be able to help him subdue it.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan still refused, regardless of what they said. He did not even go to the assigned location on the day of competition; he went to the school\u2019s rooftop, eating his sandwich cake\u2026</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan suddenly caught sight of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d running up the rooftop, \u201cWh\u2026 Why are you still in school? Today\u2019s the day!\u201d Chu Luoxun asked, while still trying to catch her breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to pick you up! How could you hide in such a place, didn\u2019t you know that I had a tough time finding you? What are you waiting for? Let\u2019s go!\u201d Chu Luoxun urged him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say earlier that I couldn\u2019t perform with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be a professional accompaniment during the competition, even if I do become your accompaniment, I would not be able to match your standards\u2026 I, can\u2019t play the piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan kneeled at the corner of the rooftop like Hisashi Mitsui from \u201cSlam Dunk.\u201d From the bottom of his heart, he wanted to play the piano; he wanted to say, I want to play the piano!</p><br/><p>But, he was still trembling from his fear of failure, and he was still looking for a reason\u2026</p><br/><p>Under the bright sunlight, Chu Luoxun said to Gu Yuan, \u201cSo what? It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t play the piano, you just refuse to play the piano! Your reason of not being able to hear the heart of the piano is just an excuse to run away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m scared.\u201d Gu Yuan was kneeling with his head down; he remembered his failure on stage which caused him to have this trauma</p><br/><p>Everything went dark, there was nobody around, only dead silence.</p><br/><p>He could hear his mother\u2019s voice from his nightmare!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should feel relieved, the moment you couldn\u2019t hear the tune\u2026 You already gave yourself a reason to stay away from the stage, after all, you\u2019re no Beethoven!\u201d</p><br/><p>Help me! I can\u2019t hear anything!</p><br/><p>It was as if Gu Yuan had returned to his young self, sitting in front of a piano with all the audience watching him. He held his head in his hands, and in his anguish his tears rolled down from his cheeks unceasingly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDid his mind go blank?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he starting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a weird child\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he forget how to play?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was the first time I\u2019ve met such opponent; I think he just gave up on himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith one lesser opponent, then I\u2019ll have a better chance at winning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think he was too nervous\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Sinking into the bottomless pit of the dark ocean alone\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019m forever alone in the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you still jave me?\u201d Chu Luoxun\u2019s voice, just like the warm rays of sun, tore open the darkness of the abyss. Gu Yuan finally lifted his head, staring up at \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Her dazzling smile and lovely face were all so stunning!</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t hear any music and couldn\u2019t play the piano, I know everything! But still, I want to choose you! It\u2019s just as you said, you might not be able to play something that could satisfy everyone, but you still have to do your best! As long as somebody is willing to listen, I\u2019ll be sure to give my best! I want everyone who listens to my music to always remember me, that\u2019s my drive. I\u2019m a music performer, and so are you! So please, be my partner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan stared at \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d who was smiling and had tears welling up in her eyes. He felt a little ache in his chest and he stood up, \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll be your accompaniment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan walked out from the shadowy corner and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t care what happens next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan had already decided to give his best. That\u2019s right; he was a musician, no matter the outcome, he would always play the best music for his audience!</p><br/><p>After Lin Meiyue learned that Gu Yuan had finally agreed, she was happy for him too; she hoped that Gu Yuan could play the piano once again.</p><br/><p>After seeing Lin Meiyue who was happy for him, Gu Yuan felt even more motivated. As long as he has the support of his first love, Lin Meiyue, he could overcome any difficulty!</p><br/><p>Of course, he sure hoped that he would one day play alongside Lin Meiyue, even though she was nowhere close to \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d standard, but he felt that his soul was in sync with Lin Meiyue. \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was just a partner to him, without any romantic feelings.</p><br/><p>He had always believed that Lin Meiyue would be his partner when performing together, from the beginning until the end.</p>\n</div>"}

She thought that Cahir had imprisoned her sister and herself, taking them to The Nilfgaardian Empire in the South. No matter what, she had to escape with her sister.</p><br/><p>Cirilla told Olivia of her plan to escape. Of course, Olivia gave her undivided support.</p><br/><p>It was not a good idea to go to the Nilfgaardian Empire now. Nobody would respect them, even if they were the biological daughters of the Emperor Emhyr. In politics, none of that mattered.</p><br/><p>Freedom was the last thing to expect in the Nilfgaardian Empire. They would most likely be forced into more marriages. Instead of running away from the entire army, it would be better to escape from Cahir\u2019s small division.</p><br/><p>As Olivia carefully planned their great escape, Cirilla agreed to go with them.</p><br/><p>Cirilla was constantly mean to Cahir. The two princesses played the role of good cop and bad cop, earning more space to carry out their escape.</p><br/><p>Compared to Cirilla, Cahir thought that Cintra was an angelic princess. Cirilla was more like a mad sow!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, he had to remain courteous to both princesses. Emperor Emhyr has explicitly instructed him to bring the both of them back to the empire. Cahir thought that Olivia\u2019s future was much brighter than Cirilla\u2019s\u2026</p><br/><p>Cahir\u2019s mood was a radiant as the sun. He could not stop thinking about the reward he would get once they reached the empire.</p><br/><p>He did not expect them to attempt fleeing from him. On the first night they left Cintra city, Cirilla demanded that she be allowed to bathe in the river nearby. Afterall, she smelled of blood and gore. Cahir did not want to subject himself to more of Cirilla\u2019s ridiculous behavior, so he permitted her to bring Olivia with her.</p><br/><p>Cahir always thought that her majesty Princess Olivia was far wiser than Cirilla. She would never cause trouble for him. Unfortunately, both princesses never came back.</p><br/><p>Cahir returned to the empire empty-handed. Emperor Emhyr was mad at his failure, and locked him up in the dungeon for a period of time\u2026</p><br/><p>Cahir sent his men across the land to search for the two princesses. He even commanded troops from the Nilfgaardian army to storm a few locations. All efforts were futile.</p><br/><p>Of course, they could not find them. Olivia had access to the game system\u2019s minimap. It was basically a radar that detected all hostile encounters and marked them down as red dots. The duo eluded the patrols with ease.</p><br/><p>Cirilla was impressed by her sister ability, yet she did not envy her. She could not be any prouder.</p><br/><p>Along with the fall of Cintra Kingdom, they both lost their identities as princesses. However, Cirilla was finally tasting the freedom she had craved for so long!</p><br/><p>The sisters bonded more closely than ever. They outran the Nilfgaardian sentries while sneaking away from the raiders as they pillaged a nearby village.</p><br/><p>Olivia\u2019s \u201cinstinct\u201d kept the sentries off their trail, yet it was Cirilla\u2019s strength that cut a path through the raiders. Olivia\u2019s magic ability was still sealed shut.</p><br/><p>While fighting the raiders, Cirilla acted as a dependable elder for her sister. She became cold and cunning and butchered the raiders single-handedly. Every time she ripped off the limbs of a raider, the game slowed down. What a breathtaking display of slo-mo!</p><br/><p>Cirilla and her sister traveled along the river until they came upon a forest. Within the two weeks of hiding in the forest, they trained their survival skills on their own.</p><br/><p>It was difficult living in the forest. They were once princesses of Cintra with ample food and beautiful dresses. Now, they were like beggars dressed in rags.</p><br/><p>Cirilla cared little about her appearance. However, when she gazed upon her adorable sister\u2019s worn clothing, her heart wept.</p><br/><p>Cirilla was touched by her sister\u2019s help. Olivia took care of the fishing and cooking, while also patching up Cirilla\u2019s dresses and the laundry. She did all the housekeeping.</p><br/><p>It had to be Olivia\u2019s love for her sister that drove her to pick up such skills. Little that Cirilla know that Olivia had merely borrowed a certain character card\u2019s skills. These were all Xu Jing\u2019s fundamental skills. Xu Jing was not only the best student, she took care of her entire family.</p><br/><p>Every night they hugged each other to sleep. With her sister in her arms, Cirilla found all the strength she needed!</p><br/><p>After a while, the duo spent a month with a group of fugitives and moved towards the north. Everybody was starving.</p><br/><p>Cirilla would always make sure that her sister had something to eat even, if she had none for herself. Olivia had once contracted a high fever due to water shortage. Cirilla had cut her wrists to feed her sister.</p><br/><p>Cirilla had been absolutely disappointed at that moment and blamed herself for the illness her sister suffered. Though she gave most of her food to her sister, her sister somehow managed to supply her some reddish potions. After drinking those potions, she felt rejuvenated and never fell sick again.Cirilla did not think much of the \u201cRed Potion.\u201d As some of the fugitives started to die from a plague and her sister fell ill at the same time, she realized that it was her sister who gave her the will to stay alive!</p><br/><p>How does one strengthen a bond between two people? Place them in a situation where they had to depend on each other to survive. They would never hesitate to sacrifice themselves for the well-being of another.</p><br/><p>Once again, Xu Jing has found her Yang Xixi in this world. Cirilla would never disappoint Olivia.Olivia tasted the blood of Cirilla. She finally figured out the secret behind \u201cElder\u2019s Blood\u201d!</p></div>\n</div>"}

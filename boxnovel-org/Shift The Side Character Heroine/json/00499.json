Moreover, he seemed forthcoming and amicable to players. He was almost admitting that the players\u2019 professionalism was admirable. They would do anything to complete a quest, and would even die multiple times trying it.</p><br/><p>The Anonymous City was almost like a terrorist organization and seemed to be inhabited by cultists. They seemed to be no better than a bunch of paupers. They were pirates, scumbags. The humans of this world were all selfish. If they followed the saying, \u201cTake good care of yourself in your obscurity and hardship, benefit from your prosperity and fame,\u201d then it would be not bad. How would it be possible to care for the world when you can hardly survive?</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su did it this way. If she was not insane, she was an idiot and a fool, which was why so many people in this world could hurt her unscrupulously.</p><br/><p>Her sword was clearly sharper than anyone else\u2019s, but her heart was also more tender compared to anyone else. Martial artists viewed her as a devil that was open season for all to kill. As long as she lived, their sleep would leave.</p><br/><p>Her appearance had caused a wave that threatened to overturn Zhao Kingdom\u2019s imperial court. Scholars of prestigious schools and prestigious martial arts families could not walk in public without looking over their backs. The notion of equal opportunities were just far too evil. Peasants should remain peasants. Which fool thought they could turn around and be their own masters?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu Shun still remained in the dark about this, even though he was a player himself. The cutscene depicted a duel of the ages! He could not take his sight off the scene.</p><br/><p>If white-clad, blindfoldless Jane Doe Su had not been fighting Li Xiye, every flick of her sword could have taken a life.</p><br/><p>The CG did her sword justice. It was a lethal, gentle dance!</p><br/><p>However, it was not easy to deal with Li Xiye. He was already one with his sword, and his sword had found its intent.</p><br/><p>Yan Qingmeng had suddenly appeared by his side. An expert herself, she had started commenting on the battle at the peak of the Forbidden City for Wu Shun\u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Qingmeng\u2019s hand was drenched in cold sweat. She had noticed something disturbing. Li Xiye\u2019s sword seemed as agile as ever, but it lacked life. At least, when compared to Jane Doe Su\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su moved like a dancer. The roof her stage, the moon her spotlight. She was flawless!</p><br/><p>However, Li Xiye\u2019s sword had been tied down by invisible, invincible threads his complicated feelings towards Jane Doe Su.</p><br/><p>Yan Qingmeng saw, no, she knew that Jane Doe Su\u2019s sword would inevitably puncture Li Xiye\u2019s throat in twenty exchanges.</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su released the skill Fairy from The Wonderland!</p><br/><p>Li Xiye fired back</p><br/><p>Swords of the Future!</p><br/><p>This scene honored the words from before</p><br/><p>On the night of the full moon, the duel, a sword from the West, \u201cFairy from Wonderland\u201d!</p><br/><p>This CG\u2019s combat effectiveness level was off the charts. When two peerless swordsmen clashed, it was a terrifying scene!</p><br/><p>At that moment Wu Shun was prompted by Yan Qingmeng to take action. It came in the form of a pop-up option selection menu. The option was about whether to interfere in this battle at the peak. Interfering would take no effort from him whatsoever. He just had to use the \u201cImpartial Venomous Flying Sword\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Qingmeng hoped that the players would interfere. She did not want Li Xiye to be defeated by Jane Doe Su.</p><br/><p>Wu Shun chose to ignore her for once. Deep in his heart, he was hoping for Jane Doe Su to win. It could not be helped, as he was a male player. Yan Qingmeng would probably rage at him if he gave her his reasons. Was sex the only thing in the players\u2019 mind\u2026</p><br/><p>Twenty exchanges vanished in a flash. The \u201cFairy from the Wonderland\u201d skill stunned countless onlookers!</p><br/><p>Yan Qingmeng\u2019s inner peace had never been so disrupted by fear before. She could not imagine what would happen if Jane Doe Su won the fight.</p><br/><p>Now, no one could change the fate of Li Xiye.</p><br/><p>The player could not do it, Li Xiye could not do it.</p><br/><p>The two combatants closed in!</p><br/><p>Two swords lashed out from opposite directions!</p><br/><p>This was the final strike that would determine the outcome.</p><br/><p>Li Xiye was aware. His sword was slower than her\u2019s. By the time his sword pierces Jane Doe Su\u2019s chest, her sword would already be buried in his throat, up to its hilt.</p><br/><p>He could not deny him his fate.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Jane Doe Su\u2019s sword twitched to the side. It was barely discernible \u2013 a distance of one or two inches. In a master swordfight, one or two inches would be the difference between life and death.</p><br/><p>Masters made no such mistakes</p><br/><p>Was it because Jane Doe Su knew that there was no longer any distance between life and death for her?</p><br/><p>The sword was ice-cold.</p><br/><p>That ice-cold edge sunk into Jane Doe Su\u2019s chest. He even felt that the tip of the sword touching her heart.</p><br/><p>Her heart was kind, gentle, tender and complicated. It felt like the days when she drew his sword out for him.</p><br/><p>Then, Li Xiye felt a mysterious, sharp pain. The sharp pain brought him back to the time he saw his first love dying on her deathbed.</p><br/><p>It was not only pain, but also fear. A hopeless, despondent fear!</p><br/><p>This was because he knew that the happy and beautiful things in his life were about to end in a flash.</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su\u2019s life was about to end now. It had ended with Li Xiye\u2019s sword!</p><br/><p>Even so, Jane Doe Su bore Li Xiye no ill-will. There was only a feeling of gratitude that no one would ever comprehend.</p><br/><p>Li Xiye\u2019s sword slowed down at the last moment. He attempted to retract his blade.</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su could see it.</p><br/><p>She could see that Li Xiye did not want to kill her, but he still had ended up killing her. Li Xiye knew that she would rather die by this sword.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014 If I want to die, why not die by Li Xiye\u2019s sword?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014 Being able to die by Li Xiye\u2019s sword was at least more glorious than any other way of dying!</p><br/><p>Li Xiye could understand her feelings, and so he did her the favor!</p><br/><p>That explained her feelings of gratitude!</p><br/><p>Only peerless heroes understood each other to that extent.</p><br/><p>At that moment, their gazes met. Jane Doe Su exhaled, her heart and soul pouring out to meet the air!</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>No words were exchanged, but her gaze said it all. She knew that Li Xiye would understand!</p><br/><p>She fell.</p><br/><p>The bright moon vanished. The stars vanished. The east was blotted out in darkness</p><br/><p>An unrivaled swordswoman had finally fallen. Would her reputation vanish from now on?</p><br/><p>No, she had no reputation from the beginning. Her entire life was a joke. Those who had hurt her would always be the ones she had once helped. Perhaps this was her fault. It was her fault to be born in this dark and cruel world. Her heart was too pure, too tender for this world.</p><br/><p>If there were any regrets she had failed to avenge her mother.</p><br/><p>A white cloud hovered in the sky. Was it the heralding of calamity? Was it there to pay its final respects to a nameless swordswoman?</p><br/><p>Dawn was breaking, but the universe seemed darker than ever.</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su raised her arms resolutely for the final time and wrapped her eyes in her black blindfold. Her mother\u2019s whispers seemed to be echoing in her ears When you are scared, just close your eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su\u2019s face passed like the night before. It was cold, hazy, and mysterious.</p><br/><p>There was a single drop of blood on the blade!</p><br/><p>Li Xiye exhaled and gazed blankly at his surroundings. The universe lasted for ages, and the solitary silence almost crushed him.</p><br/><p>Li Xiye kept his sword and picked up Jane Doe Su\u2019s body. The sword was cold, but Jane Doe Su\u2019s body was colder.</p><br/><p>Coldest was Li Xiye\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The final battle which stunned the world was over. The opponent that was more worthy of respect than his friends had died by his sword. Would anything ever warm his heart again? Would his blood ever pump again?</p><br/><p>Would his sword remain sheathed forever, like how he was burying Jane Doe Su\u2019s body forever? No matter what, nobody would ever infringe upon these two things.</p><br/><p>He had the same respect for the both of them.</p><br/><p>Li Xiye had won. His swordsmanship had now found new room for advancement!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

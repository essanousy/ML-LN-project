After all, they have not met each other for a long time. The relationship that they had was just one of courtesy. Previously, even during their long holidays, he had not taken the initiative to contact her. Instead, he usually shared on his WeChat Moments about how he had taken his older cousin sister Zhang Wanjun out to the sea for a yacht ride. It seemed like he only had eyes for his maternal older cousin sister, and not his paternal younger cousin sister.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue was not really bothered by it. Since young, she had always been a side character. It was normal for her to escape that young master\u2019s gaze. No matter how luxurious his life was, at most, he could only play with his yacht in the real world. Zhao Youyue, on the other hand, was the embodiment of \u201cAltair.\u201d She could travel to various kinds of fantasy worlds. In terms of luxury, she had far more than Zhao Hao.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could appreciate the sights that ordinary people could never see, even in their dreams!</p><br/><p>Hence, the feeling she gave off to others was that she was just a bystander, always watching the actions of others, never joining in. For example, when facing the pursuit of suitors, it always seemed as if those boys were not chasing her, but an ordinary person called \u201cZhao Youyue.\u201d Her real self would just watch everything from the sidelines, and this left all her suitors depressed.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao was just like the clouds in the sky, wonderfully beautiful, yet unattainable.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue actually preferred Zhang Wanjun to Zhao Hao. This was because she acknowledged the fact that Zhang Wanjun was really talented. She was the real top uploader on Bilibili. \u201cBlack &amp; White Z Mold\u201d was relatively popular on Bilibili, and had a solid following.</p><br/><p>However, even though she was popular on Bilibili, it was not really all that impressive. When compared to the Douyu live streaming platform, which was a national-level platform, Bilibili was quite insignificant. As most of the content on Bilibili leaned towards 2D related things, the user base appeared to be relatively small. Those who did not really subscribe to any uploaders on Bilibili only visited whenever hot news went about. Such viewers would not know of her.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu\u2019s popularity was already evident. In fact, her Weibo follower count had exceeded the follower count of \u201cBlack &amp; White Z Mold\u201d. Furthermore, after her mysterious veil was blown off, her Weibo follower count surged uncontrollably. These followers were not like the zombie fans that Zhao Hao bought with cash. Instead, it was a true reflection of popularity made up of real people.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt that the videos Zhang Wanjun produced were way more complicated than her live streams which she recorded and posted on Bilibili. Zhang Wanjun invested a lot of time into post-production editing on her videos. She usually put a lot of effort into making her gaming videos. She also paid great attention to the audiences\u2019 visual experience, which was why her fans were so loyal to her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue admired people like Zhang Wanjun, who strived towards their passion. If not for her character cards, she would not even be able to hold a candle to this talented cousin of hers.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wanjun would not go around acting pompously like Zhao Hao, who just loved to tell everyone that he was from a prestigious family and had a reputable background.</p><br/><p>Therefore, not many people knew about her family background. They only knew that her family seemed to be decently well-off, as her various gaming gears were all of extraordinarily high specifications. However, considering that she was a top uploader on Bilibili, the income that she gets from advertisements was understandably high. Thus, many fans were inclined into thinking that all the money she spent on procuring her top-notch gaming gears were entirely self-earned.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue greatly approved of Zhang Wanjun\u2019s behavior, as she was not keen on flaunting her family background. She respected those who made a name for themselves entirely with their own abilities.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Zhang Wanjun and Zhao Youyue did not contact each other often. Zhang Wanjun had her own social circle. She was also a student council leader at a famous University in Shanghai. The students\u2019 union of this prestigious university was way better than the one in Zhao Youyue\u2019s high school. If they get lucky, they might even be able to be vaulted into an elite social circle. Reaching greater heights would not just be a dream for them.</p><br/><p>Whenever they met up, Zhang Wanjun usually took great care of Zhao Youyue. However, after their goodbyes, they would head off to their separate lives. Zhang Wanjun also knew that Zhao Youyue\u2019s high school placed great priority on studies. Zhao Youyue only had two days of leave each month, hence Zhang Wanjun also felt that it would improper for her to take up too much time.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue enters university in the near future, Zhang Wanjun might have already gone to the other side of the world to pursue further studies. Clearly, this was not in their hands.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not immediately accept Zhao Hao\u2019s invitation. Instead, she sought her parents\u2019 opinions. Zhao Youyue\u2019s father, Zhao Jiayi, said, \u201cWell, since Xiao Hao has invited you, just go with him. Let him bring you around Shanghai to play and relax. After all, long holidays are meant for plenty of fun and games. The way you coop yourself at home and just read books every day is unhealthy. When it comes to fooling around and relaxing, Xiao Hao definitely knows what to do best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hua could not help but worry for her precious daughter, as she knew what kind of character Zhao Hao was. Zhao Hao would probably still be able to take good care of his sister. However, when his scoundrel friends were involved, it was hard to say.</p><br/><p>Wang Hua usually called her \u201cLittle Sloth\u201d, and it seemed as if she despised Zhao Youyue. In actual fact, she just loved to control her daughter. Wang Hua only wished for her daughter to have a bright future. After Zhao Youyue\u2019s academic performance and musical talents surpassed the young Wang Hua, she felt that her wish had already been fulfilled. Now, no matter where she went, she could bring up her brilliant daughter and boast about her. She would boast about how her daughter\u2019s violin skills were really nothing special, oh but it was just that she was crowned the champion in the provincial violin competition not long ago\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh, were you asking about how my daughter is doing academically? Alas, I feel a little embarrassed having to say it out. It seems like she placed second in the entire cohort again this time. She is forever stuck in the second place, what a shame!</p><br/><p>In actuality, Wang Hua could not be any more smug about it!</p><br/><p>However, she could no longer say that Zhao Youyue was always second anymore. The liberal arts students had been separated from the science students. The exceptionally hard-working genius Huang Zongchao was no longer in her way. Hence, Zhao Youyue could easily get a clean sweep, and rose in the rankings while maintaining her position as the top student.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, Zhao Youyue\u2019s high school achievements had utterly surpassed Wang Hua during her good old days. This made the tsundere mother a tad bit unhappy, because she could no longer act high and mighty in front of her daughter</p><br/><p>Wang Hua was bittersweet about the whole thing. In any case, she was still very pleased to watch her daughter gradually accumulate her brilliance. She naturally began to care more about her daughter, so she said, \u201cLittle Sloth, l also agree that you should go to Shanghai to relax and have some fun, but you have to be on guard at all times. Do not easily be fooled by others. You are still underage, and there are some places that you can\u2019t go to. I\u2019ll specifically speak to that cousin brother of yours later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since her parents have agreed to it, Zhao Youyue shrugged and went along with it. A country bumpkin like her would finally be able to follow Zhao Ritian, no, it should be young master Zhao Hao, and experience a whole new world.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Hao received a reply from sister Youyue, he was obviously thrilled. However, he was once again nagged at by Zhao Youyue\u2019s mother, Wang Hua. How did her mother even find out that he was going to bring Zhao Youyue to have some fun? Anyhow, he ended up getting nagged indefinitely about things like how he had to take care of and protect his little sister with his life. The most important thing was that he, should, never, ever, speed!</p><br/><p>As her tone was so gentle, Zhao Hao could not help but feel that Wang Hua was his real mother, while his real mother was Zhao Youyue\u2019s mother instead. Which mother would train her son like a dog?</p><br/><p>Howsoever, it seemed that the elders still did not know that sister Youyue had become incredibly popular on the internet!</p><br/><p>Tomorrow, Zhao Hao would drive over to pick Zhao Youyue up. Zhao Youyue felt like live streaming tonight, thus she logged onto the platform. Upon logging in, she was shocked!</p><br/><p>Why did her perfect sockpuppet identity get exposed all of a sudden? Her whole screen was filled with bullet curtains like \u201cZhao Youyue I love you,\u201d\u201dZhao Youyue be my wife,\u201d\u201dA confession for Zhao Youyue,\u201d\u201dZhao Youyue is awesome,\u201d\u201dZhao Youyue 666\u201d, what on Earth was going on?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

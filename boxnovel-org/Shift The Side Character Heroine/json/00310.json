Not only did she post the HD illustration of Su Li in the forum, she also added, \u201cI loved your creation, it allowed me to experience all sorts of amazing fantasy worlds, can I add you as a friend, I\u2019m a loyal fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was very satisfied with the illustration that Su Li drew, the silver-haired girl in her fancy military uniform resembles her appearance in the literary world, Su Li had even brought out her conflicted and mysterious temperament in the drawing.</p><br/><p>Since this illustration would already satisfy Zhao Youyue, imagine \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d expression when she saw this drawing. The last sentence in \u201cAltair\u2019s\u201d reply, surprised her the most; she was her first fan ever since she started writing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d was a writer who was without talent. Her literature would never be on the same frequency as the readers. It would never reach anybody\u2019s heart, the reviews and comments on her work would be, \u201cobscure,\u201d \u201cI knew every word, but they do not come together to form meaning in a traditional sense,\u201d \u201cWeird,\u201d \u201cNot interesting at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many readers did hop in to read her work, but none could ever persist and become her fan, ever!</p><br/><p>To her, creating literature was a single player game, only for her own entertainment purposes.</p><br/><p>But today, someone had actually said that she was a loyal reader and a fan, and had even posted an illustration of her main protagonist!</p><br/><p>This illustration had proven everything.</p><br/><p>The female character in this illustration was the mirror image of the person \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d mind. Even her temperament was strikingly similar! At that moment, \u201cSetsuna\u201d knew that this was a real fan, a fan who took her literary work seriously and understood the main protagonist.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right; it was all thanks to Zhao Youyue that Su Li was able to draw the \u201cMilitary Uniform Princess,\u201d \u201cAltair\u201d perfectly. Other than compiling information about this character, she had even described the character in detail to Su Li.</p><br/><p>To Zhao Youyue, \u201cAltair\u201d was \u201cher.\u201d Of course, she would know everything about herself. As Su Li was drawing this illustration, she kept for real-time input from Zhao Youyue, resulting in the most accurate portrayal ever.</p><br/><p>Su Li was an efficient worker. The fact that this character originated from another character allowed her to use that as a template. Basically, Su Li just needed to change the character\u2019s hairstyle, eyes, and costume. Su Li could already draw an original character from scratch. Drawing a character based on another character would be a piece of cake.</p><br/><p>This was why it only took her less than two days to complete the character illustration of \u201cAltair\u201d to near perfection.</p><br/><p>After Su Li handed over the drawing to Zhao Youyue, she asked for her permission to post on her own Pixiv webpage and Weibo. She was very satisfied with the drawing. This awesome and attractive \u201cMilitary Uniform Princess\u201d had a mysterious charm. Her appearance spoke for itself, even though she knew nothing about this character\u2019s background, personality, and ability.</p><br/><p>But, her character appearance alone could attract many fans, even though no one would know whether she is good or evil, under all that mystery.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue agreed, she also hoped that Su Li could help make this doujin novel a little more popular, what if people actually started liking it?</p><br/><p>Some author would doggedly pursue in their art, even when the reception isn\u2019t encouraging!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not know what kind of author \u201cSetsuna\u201d was, but she knew that she would never change her ways, even if nobody reads her work, what kind of spirit was this?</p><br/><p>She deserved every form of respect from every author in the same field, from her sheer patience alone!</p><br/><p>In recent years, most authors would be impetuous, especially those who were just starting off in Qidian website. Some of the authors give up because they were not qualified to sign a contract with Qidian, while some give up because their work is received poorly. The worst kind of author would be those who had a decent subscription and a solid fanbase, yet choose to drop it, because they do not feel like not writing anymore, while being proud of doing so!</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d was just an average author whose talent had held back her passion. She would keep writing, even though she did not have a single reader, it was most commendable!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had successfully contacted \u201cSetsuna\u201d and was now her friend; she hoped to invite \u201cSetsuna\u201d out one day, and express the love she had for \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d fantasy worlds, because \u201cSetsuna\u201d had brought her to whole new worlds.</p><br/><p>As the both of them were chatting, \u201cSetsuna\u201d told Zhao Youyue that she wanted to turn her novel into a doujin animated video. She knew that her limited talent only allowed her to convey so much, only an animation could express her literary work in its complete form.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue agreed that it would be a great idea. After all, if it\u2019s just a doujin video, she could use the music talent of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d to provide music in the video. As for additional costs, it could all be settled with money.</p><br/><p>But Zhao Youyue did not know that it was actually the dying wish of \u201cSetsuna.\u201d \u201cSetsuna,\u201d thought that it was a blessing from her beloved mysterious main protagonist, when Zhao Youyue stepped up to fulfill her final wish.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhao Youyue and \u201cSetsuna\u201d were discussing about turning the novel into a doujin video, Su Li\u2019s Weibo had started another wave of storm, because of the extreme response towards the illustration of \u201cAltair\u201d!</p><br/><p>Of course, her illustrations have always been great; combined with the concept of a princess in a military uniform, and her mysterious, refined temperament, it was absolutely stunning!</p><br/><p>Once again, Su Li was able to present the beauty of \u201cAltair\u201d in this gorgeous drawing!</p><br/><p>But the aesthetics would not be the cause of the commotion. Rather, which author would be so unlucky as to get targeted by this accursed Su Li. Isn\u2019t she aware of Su Li\u2019s curse?</p><br/><p>Misfortune would soon befall upon this \u201cMilitary Uniform Princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li had stated the source of this material, she told her fans that this character was the protagonist of a title called \u201cWhite Clover,\u201d with the subheading, \u201cAltair: Divina Commedia,\u201d a doujin novel that originated from a niche game, \u201cDreamside Maroon.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

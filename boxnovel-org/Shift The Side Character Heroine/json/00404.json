Nothing had gone to plan. She now realized how vast the world truly was, and there was no end to the eccentricity of creators. They were capable of doing things that often exceeded the expectations of ordinary people.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Zhao Youyue encountered a creator who had such a blatant disregard over her actions. She had put her back into causing a ripple in this world. However, \u201cStop Gambling\u201d did not even bat an eyelid. He did not even welcome the \u201cintoxicated\u201d state that so many others could only dream of. Was this creator even here to write? Did he have a conscience?</p><br/><p>Of course not!</p><br/><p>If someone asked Sun Xian this: Why be a web novelist at all? He would drawl out something that went along the lines of this: \u201cWell, I have so much time, I just had to do something to kill that time.\u201d Who would have known that his writings would attract so many readers? All he did was to simply write a story about someone turning into a Pomeranian and act cute\u2026</p><br/><p>If creators who were pursuing fame and seeking fortune had been put in such a situation, they would surely rejoice. They would write their novels with renewed vigor and ensure that their readers would be satisfied. It was only normal for a professional writer to act as so.</p><br/><p>All this enthusiasm, praise and support only made Sun Xian mildly pleasant. The fact that he was receiving so much support from his readers gave him a warm, fuzzy feeling, but nothing more. What else did they want?</p><br/><p>Constant daily updates?</p><br/><p>Not possible!</p><br/><p>He wrote web novels just to kill time, not to torture himself. If he had to update his novel every day, when would he be able to rest?</p><br/><p>He was devoid of aspirations, and filled to the brim with ideals of a leisurely life. He only lived to enjoy life to its fullest. Mahjong reigned over everything else all the other side jobs and inconveniences.</p><br/><p>Even if inspiration forced itself upon him, he would never react to it like how other creators would. He would simply allow the inspiration to dissipate in an extremely wasteful manner and continue playing mahjong\u2026</p><br/><p>When he finally decided to kill time, he wrote them, according to his own ideas. He discarded all the inspiration aside. Why would he have to take the more interesting route?</p><br/><p>He wanted nothing more than to ensure that his work remained as leisurely and carefree as him. Only this way, could he lay back in the process of creation\u2026</p><br/><p>This was his zone, his turf. Why stress himself out like other creators who were slaves to \u201cdeadlines\u201d and stuff. Even editors would often transform into devils before the deadlines and drive their authors like slaves. The pressure and stress were just too much. Such pressure would undoubtedly affect the quality of their work.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had pulled the shortest straw ever. She had encountered an utterly useless excuse of a creator this time. She never imagined him to be such a person. She had assumed the fault to be hers. She had deliberately interacted with the male protagonist to get a share of his \u201cscreen time.\u201d This probably made the creator very uncomfortable, and did not follow through with it</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhao Youyue had found her intervention completely blotted out by the creator. She may be discontented about it, but she could not deny how refreshing it was.</p><br/><p>If she no longer felt optimistic about this story, she might have shut off every semblance of safeguarding and put her foot down. She could simply murder the protagonist and ruin the entire novel. That way, regardless of the creator writing these scenes out, she would be able to make her exit.</p><br/><p>Even if that was the case, the next time the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d opened, her next world would still be a random choice, by discretion of the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d If the next world provided her no better comfort than \u201cDog Days,\u201d she would have been frustrated to no end. The \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d simply loved messing with her\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue quickly made a decision. She would personally contact the creator of \u201cDog Days,\u201d and attempt to arrange for her appearance in that world. At the same time, she would use various methods of egging him on, and make known to him the intense resentment that his loyal readers harbored.</p><br/><p>Then, a problem arose. How could this creator be contacted?</p><br/><p>Generally, authors would establish their personal reader groups, but \u201cStop Gambling\u201d did not. Thus, readers had no way of urging him on. This could be considered a smart move on his part, as he never left the readers any opportunities to urge him for updates</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this work was contracted, which indicated that the editor had the means of contacting the author. Authors who had their qualms would be added into an author group by the editor, according to different categories.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue suddenly thought of someone. Of course, it was the internal manager \u2013 Shi Jingnian, who was still in the midst of convalescence. She paid Shi Jingnian another visit. He looked considerably better. However, when he saw the short-haired, side-character Zhao Youyue, he was not as enthusiastic, considerate, and patient as before.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian was a horny guy. He would only show his best attitude when dealing with top beauties. Therefore, his eyes would only accept the long-haired goddess Zhao Youyue. The short-haired, side-character Zhao Youyue did not exist in his world.</p><br/><p>No matter what, Zhao Youyue was still his creditor. He could only obey the demands of his creditor.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue saw Shi Jingnian, she said, \u201cAre you in the Qidian city signed authors\u2019 group? There\u2019s a certain author I\u2019m looking for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian did not feel like saying anything. He wordlessly handed over his QQ account to Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue logged onto Shi Jingnian\u2019s QQ account. She realized that this guy was not only the big-shot internal manager that had abandoned more than a dozen web novels, but was also part of almost every author group and of every possible category. He was part of so many QQ author groups that one would have trouble comprehending what they read\u2026</p><br/><p>Clearly, Zhao Youyue\u2019s idea had been a nave one. This \u201cQidian City and Workplace Channel\u201d contained 999 people. Only some of the creators inside used their own pseudonyms which allowed their works to be traced. The others were simply using their personal monikers.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, how would Zhao Youyue search for this \u201cStop Gambling\u201d?</p><br/><p>She dropped in a message using Shi Jingnian\u2019s QQ account, \u201cIs \u201cStop Gambling,\u201d the author of \u201cDog Days\u201d here?\u201d She even started asking around for someone who knew \u201cStop Gambling.\u201d</p><br/><p>The creator \u201cStop Gambling\u201d was clearly a veteran lurker. On top of that, he was a new author. Naturally, no one knew who he was. Instead, the senior internal manager Shi Jingnian was recognized. While the group of authors who fell into his trap was busy yelling at him, they were also asking him for updates. Of course, Zhao Youyue happily replied saying, \u201cThe updates for the novels will be resumed, it\u2019s just a temporary suspension of publication. They have not been abandoned\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the authors were also readers. Naturally, their passion for reading mirrored their passion for writing. Shi Jingnian was a senior internal manager. As a senior in the field, countless younger authors were his readers, which explained why something like that would happen.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had always thought that it was easy to contact web novelists. When the cold, harsh truth finally hit her in the face, she soon realized how wrong she had been!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

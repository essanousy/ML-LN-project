The smart ones would sense something amiss and flee.</p><br/><p>But if they allowed the prey to roam into an otherwise hidden enclosure, the prey would never be aware of his peril until it was too late.</p><br/><p>Every step he took was one step closer to his grave\u2026</p><br/><p>Playboys plagued this world. They knew the magic words needed to put a smile on a lady\u2019s face. They would pounce on the opportunity to say \u2018yes\u2019 to each other demands. Of course, PlayGirls existed too. These ladies may not have been born with pretty faces, but they could instantly transform into goddesses with some makeup and a key ingredient: sultry, seductive hip-swaying.</p><br/><p>Some ladies were gifted with a mysterious charm; people could not stop themselves from talking to them. If they had the looks, men would start thinking with their nether regions, rather than their heads. If these pretty faces asked for the love of one night, how many men would say no to them?</p><br/><p>Single guys would assume that the lady was dead serious. Men with partners would be divided into two groups. The good ones would refuse the invitation. The other group would fulfill her needs without hesitation, hoping for another chance in the future. It would be great if they could be regular friends with benefits.</p><br/><p>Such was the nature of living creatures. Whether it was a man or a woman, they were vulnerable to temptations.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao was rich enough to buy more than a single type of character. This time, she easily hired the perfect slut. This lady was experienced in relationships, and lots of men were willing to die for her. She was an expert at snagging prey through online exchanges.</p><br/><p>Unlike the angelic Lady Zhao, she had been born with an ordinary face. However, her makeup skills were otherworldly, a dab here, a trace there, she would look like a true Goddess.</p><br/><p>Most of all, she attended an ordinary university in Jiangnan. She was experienced in relationships and smarter than ordinary girls, but she was humble enough to appreciate every man for what they did best.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue was not going to contact her directly. If things got out of her, her involvement in this would get revealed. Nevertheless, her \u201cLittle Beauty\u201d plan worked marvelously. With unlimited funds, catfishing would be bold, direct and effective.</p><br/><p>Like mice with cheese on a mousetrap, men would easily be seduced, unless they were weirdos like Han Leng and Du Hang.</p><br/><p>Catfishing was a slow, deliberate process. You will not see the results after a day or two. The prey must never be alerted to the danger.</p><br/><p>Cao Chuanguang had thoroughly underestimated the influence of the Zhao family. If they wanted it, they could take much more than his fame and glory \u2013 taking his life wasn\u2019t out of the question.</p><br/><p>Even so, this was like a side-hobby for Zhao Youyue. She moved back to the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d hoping that it would provide her with a much more practical world this time.</p><br/><p>She had not spent much time in \u201cPerfect Acting,\u201d so the cooldown duration was short. It was not exactly a sleeping victory, but she had cleverly used Zhang Guorong\u2019s real-life fame to great effect, creating an iconic character with relative ease.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was still basking in the afterglow of her last success. That victory had just been ridiculous.</p><br/><p>It was just another ordinary night when Zhao Youyue pushed open the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d again. She was having a bad feeling about this. After forging an iconic card, the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d would rob her of all her luck, forcing her to play along in a plain, dull world\u2026</p><br/><p>Her eyes flew wide open when she saw the title, \u201cFast Track: No Limits.\u201d It was a famous comic that had yet to end!</p><br/><p>The comic already had a moving picture adaptation of its own. Its GIF and memes have had limited success on the internet. Some of its lines were even trending at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday I lost to a Wuling Hong Guang on xx mountain.[1] He drifted around corners like a goddamn janitor. His car had been blazingly fast; all I could see was his xxx advertisement on the car. If you know who he is, please tell him this Saturday, 5pm, I will be waiting for him at xx mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, \u201cFast Track: No Limits\u201d should be a version of the famous racing manga, \u201cInitial D\u201d that we all know in another dimension.[2] Mountain road-racing was ridiculously exciting. You\u2019ll never see such action in reality. Real-life automotive racing often took place on well-built, even terrain with specially-built racing cars. Formula One racing was great, but drifting was utterly unnecessary on track.[3]</p><br/><p>In the manga, customized but otherwise consumer-level vehicles would speed down the hill, defying the laws of physics. It was oddly satisfying.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s cousin had started to race after reading \u201cFast Track: No Limits.\u201d He did not know how to modify a car, nor did he know how to drift on the road. Still, he dreamt of being an underground car racer. It was cool.</p><br/><p>Because he wanted to be cool, he had almost immediately totaled his supercar that was worth billions. Age had mellowed him down, albeit just a little. Every once in a while, he would bet heavily on his favorite underground racer. It was for his old hobby\u2019s sake, but he would not dare get in a car himself and race down the dangerous cliffs anymore.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue read the summary of this latest story. Enough of it was spoken about on the internet. It had been adapted into other mediums. Once again, she had struck the jackpot!</p><br/><p>She was the queen of luck!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue totally forgot about Cao Chuanguang\u2019s disgusting efforts. Her mind was already racing on methods that allowed her to forge an iconic female racer from \u201cInitial D\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>Once she learns how to race and drift like a maniac, she could participate in real-life underground racing!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Wuling Hong Guang is a compact Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV) produced since September 2010 by SAIC-GM-Wuling, the joint venture of Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, Liuzhou Wuling Motors Co and GM China.

It was serialized in Young Magazine from 1995 to 2013, with the chapters collected into 48 tank\u014dbon volumes by Kodansha. The story focuses on the world of illegal Japanese street racing, where all the action is concentrated in the mountain passes and rarely in cities or urban areas, and with the drift racing style emphasized in particular. Professional race car driver and pioneer of drifting Keiichi Tsuchiya helped with editorial supervision. The story is centred on the prefecture of Gunma, more specifically on several mountains in the Kant\u014d region and in their surrounding cities and towns. Although some of the names of the locations the characters race in have been fictionalized, all of the locations in the series are based on actual locations in Japan.</p><br/><p>[3] Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group.

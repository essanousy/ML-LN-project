She had an expressionless face and was wearing a plain uniform with a ponytail just like any other girl in reality. Who would have thought that a side character from the start would now capture his soul?</p><br/><p>This chapter of \u201cPure Romance\u201d did not let Jiang Chao down. This was because he noticed that the mangaka had reduced the main character\u2019s scenes as well as \u201cplain jane-s\u201d, and carried on with the story through \u201cXu Jing\u2019s\u201d first person view instead. It seemed like the mangaka had noticed that the most interesting and eye-catching character in this manga was none other than \u201cXu Jing\u201d.</p><br/><p>Very soon, Jiang Chao saw Xu Jing\u2019s house which appeared in the manga for the first time. He dropped his jaw, and stopped munching on his plate of noodles. He had never thought that Xu Jing\u2019s family would be that poor!</p><br/><p>At the same time, he also discovered that the mangaka named \u201cSu Li\u201d seemed to have great improvement in her drawing skills. After all, she managed to draw such a catchy background. With a single glance, the readers would understand that Xu Jing\u2019s family was in a bad shape. It was like the mangaka had seen this miserable family with her own eyes in the manga world\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao knew the reason Xu Jing was so obsessed with studying at once. It seemed to be arise from her strong will to change her own fate. Her dream was to become a doctor to treat her father\u2019s sickness. What was the sickness? The mangaka had never mentioned that, it was merely known to be a continuous chronic disease, the type that urges for continual expenses for recuperation.</p><br/><p>Seeing how Xu Jing took care of her father in a swift and neat manner without showing any detest on her face, at that moment, he felt as if his heart was melted by goddess Xu Jing. After all, filial piety is a Chinese traditional virtue from ancient times. It was said that a person with a loving heart will surely leave a favorable impression towards the others. On the contrary, for someone who is unfilial to their parents, would anyone want to be friends with them?</p><br/><p>Most importantly, Jiang Chao genuinely thought that the drawing skills and techniques of the mangaka were splendid. In fact, what Su Li had drawn were merely the moments Xu Jing took care of her bedridden father and her commendable act of feeding her father with medicine. But it was so exquisite that it had amplified the character \u201cXu Jing\u201d, leaving affection to the readers and getting people to remember this scene deep in their hearts!</p><br/><p>Readings \u201cPure Romance\u201d up to now, Jiang Chao had never felt a touch from his heart when the mangaka drew the interactions between the male protagonist and the \u201cplain-jane-s\u201d. Sometimes, these characters were so awkward that they were like some marionettes controlled by the mangaka, which forcefully acted to give the readers what they wanted.</p><br/><p>However, \u201cXu Jing\u201d was drawn to life by the mangaka and seemed to have gotten her own soul. Her every acts and moves were out of her own will, while the mangaka was simply just a recorder. She did not force this character to perform any awkward acts. Thus the story was a smooth read for the readers. Yeah, it feels good this way.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao finally finished his plate of noodles and sausage. He held the magazine and climbed up the upper deck of his bunk bed. Then he laid down comfortably. At this moment, he felt that was the happiest thing in his life, for being able to read a manga that could reach the bottom of his heart, yet on a carefree weekend afternoon.</p><br/><p>The following plots caused him to adore Xu Jing further. Due to poverty from youth, she was excellent at houseworks and had helped her mom in countless things. She also knew how to cook, albeit some simple dishes. For someone as poor as her, forget about the exotic food, having adequate foods and clothes was good enough.</p><br/><p>What impressed Jiang Chao the most was that \u201cXu Jing\u201d did not abandon her studies even at moments she had to cook for her family. With Su Li\u2019s outbursting drawing skills, this scene had channelled positive energy to the readers, drawing more impressions and affections towards \u201cXu Jing\u201d.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Jiang Chao\u2019s brain was overloaded with the beautiful images of \u201cXu Jing\u201d for now. He could not help reckoning that the girls in reality were crap in comparison to \u201cXu Jing\u201d. They were all three dimensional garbage!</p><br/><p>No, wait. Jiang Chao suddenly remembered Zhao Youyue who sat behind his desk-mate. To him, this girl was not bad at all, though she might not be a beauty at one\u2019s first glance. Come to think of it, she was actually pretty cute, and had a pleasant voice as well. Most importantly, she had shown no bias against Two Dimensional World and were willing to listen to his various sermon and preach. Hmm.. indeed worthy to be taught. Unlike Zhou Fang who was behind him, she knew nothing more than studying everyday. That was simply boring and ignorant.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Zhao Youyue was not his type even though she was cute. Because he thought that Zhao Youyue did not possess any protagonist halo. She did not have those iconic Moe characteristics from anime, for example Tri-no, Tsundere nor Tennen-boke[1]. He thought that if Zhao Youyue would become a side character without specialty nor a sense of presence if she was to be placed into an anime.</p><br/><p>After all, the character he was really into now was \u201cXu Jing\u201d who had the Moe characteristics of \u201cTri-no\u201d, \u201chardworking\u201d, and \u201celite scholar\u201d. Then, when he saw \u201cXu Jing\u201d smiled for the first time in the manga, he was so excited that he nearly jumped off the upper bunk. Anyone who saw that would be puzzled. Wasn\u2019t that just a manga character, why would somebody hold such a reaction?</p><br/><p>Maybe this was the love of Jiang Chao towards the Two Dimensional World..</p><br/><p>Yet when Jiang Chao read the scene of Xu Jing being publicly punished near the ending of this chapter, it made him burst into anger. How he wished he could rush into the manga and put that son-of-the-b*tch local government officer to death!</p><br/><p>Needless to say, the scenes of abusing Xu Jing were more influential than ever. Readers whose souls had entered the manga would not discern the illogical parts of the plots. In reality, where on earth would a nasty local government officer carry such a big club that could so easily tore clothes into shreds?</p><br/><p>While reading this, Jiang Chao would care less about what was illogical behind it. Instead, he felt prickled in his heart. Why must his goddess Xu Jing suffered such a cruel fate? She had worked so hard, just to bump into such misfortune? On the contrary, the main character and the plain jane-s were all surrounded by laughters. He took more pity for Xu Jing now\u2026 Therefore, he spent 10 minutes enjoying the fanservice of Xu Jing where she got hit till her clothes were torn apart. Though there were not any body-revealing scenes, it was however more eye-catching than nudity. After that, he went into the toilet.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, although I\u2019m not sure whether he is a guy or girl, but good old Su Li really got me through the erotic scenes.\u201d Jiang Chao muttered, \u201cArgh, after finishing this I will need to wait for another week to see the latest chapter. This is killing me, I want to read the upcoming story\u2026 Although it would probably go the same old way where the main character saved the beauty with his invisible strategy, but I still want to see it so badly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The contents in this chapter also ignited the upsurge of the supporters for this character online!</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u2013 Tennen-boke.

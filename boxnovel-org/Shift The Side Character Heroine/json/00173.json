The two girls could not afford to pay for such luxury meal, so they ordered as little as possible.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhao Youyue did not have a big stomach, she loved to eat. As usual, she ordered whatever dishes from the menu that caught her eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao stared wordlessly at Zhao Youyue\u2019s innocent actions. His family lived in pretty decent conditions, because he had learned the piano when he was young but his family was not filthy rich.</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao did not have a lot of pocket money either, and he did not have the ability to earn his own money despite being the top student of the school.</p><br/><p>Perhaps only Han Leng, the genius essayist, could earn money through his own power, among his fellow classmates.</p><br/><p>Soon, Zhao Youyue caught hold of the awkwardness, and she looked up and smiled, \u201cThis will be my treat, it is important to eat well and be happy during a gathering!\u201d</p><br/><p>This greatly embarrassed the three guys, they were usually viewed in divine light because of their excellent grades, but now they felt tiny, having to spend a few thousand RMB on a single meal\u2026</p><br/><p>This might be the power of money.</p><br/><p>The two girls who did not dare to order much dishes were unhappy with Zhao Youyue, both of them had thought Zhao Youyue had turned insane and had decided to all of her savings on this meal because she wanted to show off!</p><br/><p>Of course, they were measuring Zhao Youyue by their own financial standards; they felt they were more superior than Zhao Youyue because they were looking down on Zhao Youyue in their hearts\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, Shen Menglian snapped, \u201cZhao Youyue, wouldn\u2019t you think that ordering this much will be a waste? Our teachers have taught us to be grateful for our food\u2026 Look at you, still wearing our uniform during the weekend, you can\u2019t be that well off, right? Are you sure that you\u2019re not acting rashly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhao Youyue felt most unwelcomed among this group of top students, can\u2019t they just settle down and enjoy a meal?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not acting rashly; I simply wanted to try more dishes. I\u2019m doing this restaurant a favor by spending my money, increasing their domestic demand and promote economic cycle. Is it wrong for me to do something that benefits the country? I\u2019m actually contributing to our country!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue said that, she got the shop owner to prepare for the dishes, and she instantly became the host of this gathering. As a person who is used to eating luxurious meals, she had that dominating aura surrounding her!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue might be a side character in school, but she would definitely become the main character of every restaurant! She always hoped that she had a \u201cGodly tongue,\u201d it would be best if she had an excellent sense of taste!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had wholly overwhelmed the others; not even Wang Zongchao could stand up against her imposing manner\u2026 They could only bow down to Miss Zhao Youyue, handing a cup of tea to her obediently.</p><br/><p>As per usual, Zhao Youyue only took a bite from every dish, she would only take an extra bite of the ones that were delicious. Her fellow students were staring at the hearty dishes, and they found it too embarrassing to dig in.</p><br/><p>At last, Zhao Youyue knew she would never be able to mix in with these top students because she was not one of them, to begin with. Unlike them, she did not pay much attention to studying, and she definitely would not feel arrogant after she gets decent grades.</p><br/><p>She intended to retain good grades because she would have more privileges and make her life in school much easier. As for entering a good university like Tokyo Metropolitan University or Chung Hua University, she could easily do it if she manages to obtain another one or two abilities, even if she gets average result. Well, this sounded extremely unfair to the other top students.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not want to attend to Tokyo Metropolitan University because it was too far away from home, she would rather attend Jiangnan University. It would be rather interesting, attending her mother\u2019s classes\u2026</p><br/><p>A person like Zhao Youyue from the Zhao family was absolutely overpowered! People had to strive hard to achieve success, but Zhao Youyue was already there the moment she was born.</p><br/><p>As everyone was eating, the situation was becoming more awkward. Although Zhao Youyue had said this was her treat, everyone else was worried that she could not afford to pay for the meal, and so, they were afraid of splitting the bills.</p><br/><p>When nobody was willing to spend the money, they were not in the mood to eat\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue kept a straight face while everyone else was uneasy, she proceeded to the counter and paid the bills, and she smiled and waved at them, \u201cI\u2019m happy to meet all of you, I had fun today. See you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Youyue left the shop without turning back. A luxury car stopped at the entrance of the shop, which attracted a lot of attention. Uncle Liu proceeded to open the door for Zhao Youyue and guided her into the rear seat of the car. After that, uncle Liu returned to his driver seat and drove away.</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao and his friends looked at each other; no words could ever describe their feelings at this moment. Xu Na and Shen Menglian\u2019s faces were bright red because they had been gossiping about Zhao Youyue being a show-off\u2026</p><br/><p>It turned out Zhao Youyue was not a show-off, but a genuinely rich lady!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, it would be a waste if we don\u2019t finish this, let\u2019s us eat.\u201d Guo Peisheng started to gobble up the food after saying that, he was feeling hungry because he did not eat much just now.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Cao Yuan had started to dig in too. The dishes were indeed delicious, it would be a waste to throw them away. Besides, it would be an honor to eat a leftover from a rich lady!</p><br/><p>Only Wang Zongchao had lost the appetite to eat because he knew his relationship with Zhao Youyue was all over. Without a doubt, she was already be disgusted by their attitude because they could not even bear with this \u201clittle money\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, that amount of money was \u201clittle\u201d in her eyes, but not so little in their eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what exactly does Zhao Youyue\u2019s family do?\u201d Xu Na gossiped while still eating.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuh, obviously a rich lady! Anyone will know by looking at the car she went home with. How can I make such a dumb mistake, how embarrassing\u2026\u201d Shen Menglian said it awkwardly, at the same time she felt regret because she knew she had offended Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao had fallen into a long silence, he always thought he was at the top of the clouds, a superior feel because he was the greatest in school. He understands something when he was out of school, all those results he obtains would be nothing because he could not even afford a meal with it\u2026 He felt regret to handover all the scholarships he had.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not bothered about the opinions of those top students because she knew they would not get along with her, they simply do not have something in common, she still prefers to be a side character among them\u2026</p><br/><p>After that, Zhao Youyue proceeds to enter the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d, carefully craft the character of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d.</p>\n</div>"}

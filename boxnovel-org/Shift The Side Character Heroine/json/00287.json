This resembled the saying that goes, \u201cSpectators see the chess game better than Players.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was used to observing the world as an outsider, she would see through things in a matter of seconds. Nobody could possibly dupe her. However, she was no better than her would-be manipulators; she would not unmask the perpetrator on the spot, as she would be curious to see their game to the end.</p><br/><p>Although she was no longer a side character, her ability to \u201csee through\u201d was still there.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, she had already known that Shen Menglian had her own schemes, while Bai Yunshan was a cute figure of pedantry who stood up against every manner of misdeed. She never told lies, she spoke it as it is.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Zhao Youyue was fond of Bai Yunshan, thinking that it was worthy befriending this girl. They could even be life-long friends, if this Bai Yunshan ever gives in to her wholeheartedly.</p><br/><p>Even though Bai Yunshan was the antagonist of her world who persistently attempts to correct her misdemeanors, she had only grown to trust her more.</p><br/><p>It clicked. Shen Menglian was the one behind the scenes, Zhao Youyue thought to herself.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the situation did not stand by Bai Yunshan\u2019s side. She felt so hopeless and wronged, thinking that the world was against her. She had been a remarkably tough girl, but she felt like crying now. Perhaps her menstrual period had a hand in this.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue still had not realized the possible utilization of her \u201cZhou Chun Card\u201d which would give her the stamina bar of a character in a video game. Nevertheless, she stood up for Bai Yunshan. With her gentle and soothing voice, she said, \u201cI decided to participate in the sports competition this time as I have never participated in one before. I will do my best! So, don\u2019t blame it on our class monitor anymore. I am the one who was not careful enough. It was all my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her taking up the responsibility, her classmates believed in her even more, thinking that she had given up defending herself even though, clearly, she had been played the fool by their class monitor, or, possibly, backstabbed by Shen Menglian. What a noble soul!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Bai Yunshan was moved by the diplomatic methods of Zhao Youyue. She saw her in a new light, thinking that perhaps Zhao Youyue, who seemed to have a great sense of collective honor, was not as bad as she thought. However, she was surely the greatest obstacle she had ever met, the troublemaking top student whom she simply could not get one up on.</p><br/><p>Disregarding the fact that her menstrual period was yet to be over, Bai Yunshan said with a sense of justice, \u201cLet me take the 3000-meters event that takes place on the second day. It would be unfair for you to run two days in a row. I had consulted you on this before, as I felt that something was off about this arrangement, but you never said anything about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was saying this, she glared at Shen Menglian, realizing that Shen Menglian had been egging her to go against Zhao Youyue since the beginning. She had been aware of this since the beginning, but carelessness had gotten the better of her, this time!</p><br/><p>Shen Menglian was disappointed, as she felt that her plan had failed. Zhao Youyue not only did not argue with Bai Yunshan but chose to let it slide like nothing. It seemed like she had projected her own pettiness onto Zhao Youyue and had expected the Lady to react to things as she would</p><br/><p>Because of the willingness of Zhao Youyue to take up the blame and Bai Yunshan being fair by sharing the responsibility with her, they were able to put off the great dispute that could have been created.</p><br/><p>Others were also smart enough to notice that Shen Menglian was the mastermind behind all this!</p><br/><p>Xie Ting was one of them. She never thought that Shen Menglian would plot against Lady Zhao. She was curious to know what was in Lady Zhao\u2019s mind</p><br/><p>After that, Bai Yunshan approached Zhao Youyue to talked to her in private. Before she could open her mouth, Zhao Youyue smiled and said, \u201cI know what you are going to say, and my answer is, I trust you more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inexplicably, Bai Yunshan was greatly touched by her affirmation, and her despair was alleviated. Nonetheless, she asked her curiously, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you are an upright girl who holds fast to principles. People like you are one in a million. Keep being yourself; it\u2019s why I think you\u2019re cute.\u201d Zhao Youyue\u2019s smile was as beautiful as usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why do you still go against me by not obeying school\u2019s rules?\u201d Bai Yunshan was still confused about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not. In fact, I never broke a single rule. There\u2019s nothing that says I can\u2019t play toys during recess, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, there you are nitpicking over the details again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDetails? Here\u2019s what the fact of the matter is. Results speak for the rules of the school. My results are excellent, so I have never broken a rule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d Bai Yunshan could not say anything about that. All this while, her upright attitude had worked to her advantage, as she often brought down students who were not performing as well in exams, but, she could not do a single thing against Zhao Youyue who was the top student. However, this had motivated her to improve her results, as she earnestly wanted to correct the Lady\u2019s bad habits and set her on her path again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still going to continue your friendship with Shen Menglian?\u201d asked Bai Yunshan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I do so?\u201d Zhao Youyue answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still okay with her being a friend, even after knowing that she was playing you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you would do, but I will carry on as if nothing had happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be an idiot. You know that she meant you ill since the beginning, yet, you still choose to stick with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much ill will can a girl harbor? She must simply be jealous. After all, I take pride in my good nature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that, and I also know that you are a big-hearted person. But you are going to get hurt if you carry on with this. Obviously, she\u2019s picking on you. I just can\u2019t stand by this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Class monitor, are you being concerned about a bad person like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not! You are unable to distinguish between good and bad. Never mind that, we should stop hereanyway, thank you for trusting me,\u201d Bai Yunshan thanked Zhao Youyue from the bottom of her heart.</p><br/><p>Although she denied her concerns about Zhao Youyue, she had made up her mind that she would keep an eye out for Shen Menglian to see if she is going to cause any trouble again. As Shen Menglian\u2019s results were not as good as hers and she did particularly poorly for her latest monthly test, the teacher definitely would take action on her!</p><br/><p>Do not underestimate a whistle-blowing class monitor!</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue returned from school, she unconsciously checked on the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d which was still in its cooling state. Out of a sudden, she saw that she would not need to worry about the long-distance race, as long as Bai Yunshan hands her a sports drink from the side of the track. This way, she would be able to run tirelessly, and the 3000-meter track would not be a problem to her!</p><br/><p>This was the power of the \u201cZhou Chun Card.\u201d Her brain must have fallen asleep as she panicked earlier on. It never once considered the possibility of using the card for this purpose. All this while, she had seen it as a rather pointless but valuable existence</p><br/>\n</div>"}

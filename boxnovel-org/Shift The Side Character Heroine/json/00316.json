She did not know what had actually happened. She had only illustrated the military uniform princess \u201cAltair.\u201d Why would the Doujinshi novel\u2019s author, \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d death of natural causes, have anything to do with her?</p><br/><p>Su Li did not blame Zhao Youyue for her current predicament. She knew that Zhao Youyue was utterly unaware that \u201cSetsuna\u201d had been seriously ill as well.</p><br/><p>After all, this fanmade anime video about \u201cAltair\u201d was the brainchild of Zhao Youyue\u2019s and Su Li\u2019s collaboration. Of course, Lady Zhao had taken care of the expenses. Su Li was like a voluntary worker. She only took a small sum as a symbol. She cared more about her relationship with Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she had been trying her best to assist Lady Zhao regarding drawing. After all, Su Li had been very hardworking. She had finished the outline of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d in a concise time. She was well ahead of schedule. As a result, she had an abundance of free time.</p><br/><p>But now, Su Li was struck by a different kind of fear. If the rumors about a writer\u2019s death due to her curse truly pick up, would anyone even \u2018risk their lives\u2019 to approach her?</p><br/><p>Such a writer might even appear. He could have been planning to write a popular character to death. Yet, he had not dared to do so. Therefore, he had come up with an idea. He would request Su Li to draw an illustration for the character. Then, he would immediately leave that character in its grave. In the end, he would send out a heartfelt plea, claiming that the character had to die in his place, otherwise he would have been the one in its place. Therefore, he would have valid reason to beg for forgiveness!</p><br/><p>All right. All would be well. But, Su Li who had accepted the order, would carry the pan skillfully once again\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Li was deeply anxious that such a thing would happen!</p><br/><p>But if they paid well, how would she possibly decline those offers? It was money, and she earned them through drawing. Those were legal sources of income. She was not only a mangaka, but also an illustrator.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Su Li felt a twang of pessimism about her future.</p><br/><p>Previously, as the fanvideo was still in production stages, Su Li had learned a lot of information about \u201cSetsuna\u201d from Zhao Youyue. But, Zhao Youyue obviously did not know about \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d illness. She had even felt that \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d writing efficiency was quite high. She had considered \u201cSetsuna\u201d to be a writer full of passion and energy.</p><br/><p>How could such a writer die of illness?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue heard all of Su Li\u2019s complaints. She could only comfort Su Li, telling Su Li that none of it was her fault. Zhao Youyue had figured out that \u201cSetsuna\u201d had been seriously ill, a long time ago. It was the last stage of cancer. It did not matter if Su Li was involved or not, \u201cSetsuna\u201d would not have lived long anyway.</p><br/><p>It was normal for humans to grow old and die of ailments.</p><br/><p>Besides, \u201cSetsuna\u201d was clearly pleased and honored that the famous illustrator Su Li was willing to draw illustrations for her work. She could finally see the 2D imagery of her written heroine. She had cast such a beautiful, powerful, daunting image.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s words of comfort were quite effective. Or else, Su Li might have even begun suspecting the validity of her curse. This time, the character did not die, but the author had died instead. This was something too iffy!</p><br/><p>Yet, the game producer of \u201cDreamside Marron,\u201d Zhu Yinzhu made Su Li\u2019s curse even more impressive. She had gone ahead and shared \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d Weibo page. She even commented, \u201cIt\u2019s so terrifying. If she had not suffered such fate, would I be the one dying instead? But even so, I still encourage Su, the Great Deity to continue on with Altair\u2019s story. This recreated character has truly won over my heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yinzhu\u2019s Weibo was rather niche. Ordinary readers were not very familiar with her. But the Doujinshi writers and those who had some understanding for the ACG culture, knew that she was the \u201cLady Zun\u201d who frowned upon commercialization, and left her content out in the open, as free game for all Doujinshi writers. She was a talented and wealthy Lady.</p><br/><p>Therefore, after she had commented in such a ridiculous, yet low-key encouraging, more people got to know of Su Li. At the same time, \u201cAltair\u201d gained even more recognition.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, Su Li was still defending herself innocently, \u201cI hope that people don\u2019t take me as the butt of jokes so casually. \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d cancer was an unfortunate, but a natural occurrence. I truly mourn for her as well. But, this truly does not concern me. Why should I be blamed for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Su Li\u2019s post on Weibo was soon carpet-bombed. Most of the comments demanded that Su Li own up to the venom of her drawing pen. Any popular character who gets the attention of her pen would never fare well</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had been paying attention to Su Li\u2019s Weibo. When she noticed that Su Li had been completely submerged in the saliva of the masses, she could not help but dive in as her sockpuppet \u201cAh Yu,\u201d the popular live streamer, VA, Bilibili uploader. \u201cAh Yu\u201d then commented, \u201cTeacher Su Li was the one who drew my \u2018face.\u2019 It even comes with a variety of emoticons. Yet, I still live. Therefore, everyone, please stop bothering teacher Su Li. She\u2019s so pretty and cute, everyone, please support her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although \u201cAh Yu\u201d was not a LoL streamer anymore, she was still rather popular. LoL was not challenging for her anymore; she was already the top 1 player on the national server.</p><br/><p>The contents of her live stream had gradually transitioned from gaming to music. The genre had been changed to 2D as well. It was a change for the better. She was now a super popular VA, just because of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d and \u201cAltair.\u201d The latter was not even an official anime, but only a fan made video.</p><br/><p>In a way, \u201cAh Yu\u201d was currently an extremely popular live streamer, especially among 2D lovers. Her vocal and violin covers often comprised of popular anime songs. She now had a clearer grasp of the direction of her live stream which was initially multifarious.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Zhao Youyue had decisively changed her image. For her, the amount that her \u201cAh Yu\u201d identity could earn was a secondary concern. More than anything, she intended to promote works that she fancied and characters that she possessed.</p><br/><p>Just like the video she made for \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d Doujinshi novel \u201cWhite Clover.\u201d If Su Li and Ah Yu\u2019s names had not appeared in the credits, it might not have even grown popular on Bilibili.</p><br/><p>Yet, Zhao Youyue had not expected to receive invitations from so many animation studios, including the world-leading companies and their heads. Various producers had expressed their recognition towards her voice acting capabilities. They also acknowledged her fame. In their opinion, as long as she continues voice acting, animes featuring her work would experience the most feverish debuts, ever.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue declined all the invitations indirectly. Her perfect voice acting was only applicable to characters that she has possessed.</p><br/><p>Su Li was very touched to see Ah Yu stepping up to defend her. Lady Zhao was the only person in this cold world who truly loved her.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu then canceled her live stream that night, and there was no live stream for a week</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But, how could she leave just like that?</p><br/><p>If she left without a hitch, Su Li who was in the midst of confusion would suddenly become normal. As such, she would stop acting like the readers\u2019 father and once again compromised with her readers. Perhaps the ending that she would draw was none other than the hero Yang Ming subduing the yuri couple, Yang Xixi and Xu Jing to his harem through the protagonist\u2019s halo. He might even make Xu Jing the queen who managed his harem. The male readers would certainly love such an ending, as subdue-ing both the yuri girls to the hero\u2019s harem was a wonderful plot for them.</p><br/><p>If this is the case, \u201cXu Jing\u201d would be forgotten. Note that Zhao Youyue was on mission to transform \u201cXu Jing\u201d into a memorable iconic character!</p><br/><p>Anyway, Zhao Youyue had to move on with it, though she had found out that the mangaka Su Li was actually a beautiful mangaka with fake account info.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue decided to stop taking pity on women. Realizing Su Li had spreaded her words on different fan groups and Weibo to assure everyone a satisfying ending, Youyue instantly admired her, feeling that she had Mr Urobuchi\u2019s ways of doing things. Back in those days, Mr Urobuchi also repeatedly stated that \u201cPuella Magi Madoka Magica\u201d was a heart-warming anime. Nevertheless, a character of \u201cPuella Magi Madoka Magica\u201d, Mami Tomoe died within 3 episodes, not to mention that the final ending was more indignant than all the previous stories. Without a doubt, the readers railed against Mr Urobuchi in fury as they had been fooled by Mr Urobuchi who claimed that his anime was heart-warming.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue reckoned that she should assist Su Li to come up with a satisfying ending. But what kind of ending should it be?</p><br/><p>Of course, it could not be a happy ending for everyone!</p><br/><p>Yang Ming who had moral degeneration must be dismembered, while the darkened \u201cXu Jing\u201d was destined to not having a happy ending. Why? Because she was the root of all evils. Out of her own desire, she had indirectly brought misfortunes upon so many girls, and so it mattered no more although she was the most tragic character in the manga.</p><br/><p>Did you think you could stir up troubles just because you had a tragic life?</p><br/><p>With a darkened character, \u201cXu Jing\u201d was no longer the pretty girl who was innocently obsessed with learning in the first place. She was even engrossed with yuri relationship, right now. If it was not for Yang Xixi whom she loved obsessively, she would not lead the plot up to this stage.</p><br/><p>Similarly, Yang Xixi was a very kind \u201clittle-sister character\u201d at first glance. In fact, she was not that of a good person. Obviously, she did not really like Xu Jing, but still she always gave Xu Jing a ray of hope. If she completely rejected Xu Jing from the very beginning, perhaps Xu Jing would not take on such an extreme trick to get her.</p><br/><p>Anyway, no one is innocent. Though he might become a \u201cbulldozer\u201d who will push many girls to his bed, still he was not a man of dominant nature in the first place. Had those girls rejected him cruelly, it would be impossible for the hero to elevate his sexual desire upon them. Sadly, all of the girls accepted his request while pretending to refuse, thus, they had brought up the troubles on themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Out came the snowy season again, whether it be in \u201cPure Romance\u201d world, or reality.</p><br/><p>Yang Ming and missy Liu Sha were holding hands while walking on the high street at night. The</p><br/><p>flakes of falling snow were fluttering, and that created a remarkably romantic atmosphere. The background of this scene was perfectly beautiful with Su Li\u2019s superb drawing skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is so cold!\u201d Yang Ming pulled out his hand and breathed on Liu Sha\u2019s cold hands to keep her warm.</p><br/><p>Having sex with Yang Ming and even unlocking all sex postures, Liu Sha had overcome her arrogant disposition. She softly held Yang Ming\u2019s hand and put it on her chest to keep him warm. The flat chest of this missy Liu Sha with a princess-like character had enlarged after the continuous fondling of Yang Ming.</p><br/><p>They gazed at each other like a perfect couple. The scene of a girl keeping a boy warm with her boobs on street looked so sweet and touching. At the same time, they inadvertently dealt 100,000 critical damages to the \u201cforever-alones\u201d who passed by\u2026</p><br/><p>In another scene, Yang Ming\u2019s childhood friend cum his very first woman, Li Xiaotong was facing a table full of dishes alone at home. Pretty much depressed, she took out her phone. Glancing through the photos of hers and Yang Ming, she softly whispered his name and touched her tummy slowly. After that, she gave Yang Ming a call.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I just mentioned that I can\u2019t go home right now?!\u201d Yang Ming answered the phone impatiently. He was at a high-class French diner with Liu Sha, thus he had to answer Li Xiaotong\u2019s phone call outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019ve already prepared dinner for you. The dishes are scrumptious. If you aren\u2019t coming back now, the dishes need to be reheated later!\u201d Li Xiaotong answered with a fretful tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Just stop bothering me. Go on and eat by yourself first!\u201d Yang Ming retorted as he was happily dating missy Liu Sha.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Ming, you don\u2019t even understand the meaning of this dinner!\u201d Li Xiaotong said as she put her hand on her tummy, \u201cJust because I wanted to have my meals with you, I tried so hard to prepare this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you that unwilling to eat the dishes I have prepared for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why? Why you are so unwilling to come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I just tell you that I have something else to do and is inconvenient to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are lying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Ming, whom you are with right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am with no one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy listening to your tone, are you going to cheat on me? Am I going to end up with the same fate like those girls you have cheated on previously? We are already staying together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I really cannot leave now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you shall give me an explanation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 Erm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you, you start humming and hawing again! Can you please be mindful? Do you still want to be a philanderer? You should know that I am pregnant and this is your baby!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, I haven\u2019t told Sha Sha about this\u2026\u201d Yang Ming whispered to himself but Li Xiaotong heard it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, why are you mentioning that fellar\u2019s name? Ah Ming? Is it because\u2026 you\u2019re with Liu Sha now? Ah Ming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you pregnant?! Why are you telling me this in front of everyone? You suddenly came to me and tell me that you are pregnant, and I really don\u2019t know what to do! Enough, I don\u2019t want to hear any more words from you. Roll back to your own home and stop thinking about the pregnancy, if you still want to stick around with me. Stop taking this for granted and claiming yourself as my girlfriend! You are just my childhood friend!\u201d Yang Ming yelled at his phone and hung up ruthlessly.</p><br/><p>Now, Li Xiaotong\u2019s depression was getting worse, and a gloomy expression had shown in her eyes. Putting her hand on her tummy again, she was infuriated and knocked over all the sumptuous dishes which she specially prepared for Yang Ming.</p>\n</div>"}

She did not respond to Han Leng\u2019s question, but instead chuckled and said, \u201cHow about I play a song for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not wait for Han Leng to respond. She casually sang \u201cAngel\u2019s Wing.\u201d She did not activate the Chu Luoxun card. She performed it through her own power. Her body remembered the guitar to an intimate level, but of course, she could not stimulate Chu Luoxun\u2019s unique \u201cspiritual music\u201d ability. She was unable to pull Han Leng into the \u201cMusical Reality Marble.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue began to sing, Han Leng started paying more attention. Obviously, he wanted to enjoy some of Zhao Youyue\u2019s music properly. He thought that he would be completely allured by Zhao Youyue\u2019s music, which was comparable to that of Goddess Chu\u2019s, and get lost in the musical world\u2026</p><br/><p>However, things fell short of his expectations. Although a non-Chu Luoxun empowered Zhao Youyue was equally talented, the effect of the performance was very different. However, there was no doubt that her music was still delightful.</p><br/><p>Her performance had dispelled Han Leng\u2019s original unhappiness. He looked at Lady Zhao, who was playing the guitar in earnest. He came to realize the depths of his pettiness a moment ago. How could he be so upset about such a trivial matter?</p><br/><p>Han Leng began to reflect upon himself. He thought that Lady Zhao was a pleasant lady, to the core. If he was Lady Zhao, he might have just left straight away. How could she still be there, calmly singing away to him?</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao had been remarkably patient with him. He should also do his part and ease up.</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue was singing, the middle-aged owner came upstairs with some coffee. The moment he saw Zhao Youyue singing for Han Leng in her casual sports attire, something took hold of his heart and overwhelmed him. Of course, Zhao Youyue might have reminded him of his teenage years.</p><br/><p>However, during his teenage years there were no girls like Zhao Youyue would go through such lengths for him. This was undoubtedly an unfortunate thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Only at the end of the song, did the literary middle-aged man place the coffee down on their table. He gave Han Leng a supportive gaze, as if he was encouraging him to make sure that he successfully pursued this talented literary girl. In his opinion, any girl that Han Leng was willing to bring here had definitely gained Han Leng\u2019s acknowledgment. She had to be an excellent writer, in her own right.</p><br/><p>Although this was clearly an assault on \u2018single dogs\u2019 like him, he was already used to it. It was necessary to see other people achieve happiness in life. If he lived his life this way, he would be more eager in pursuing his goals, with a sunnier view on his own life.</p><br/><p>Of course, Han Leng had no clue on what was in the middle-aged boss\u2019 mind. This time, he really brought Zhao Youyue here, solely to talk about literature. He wanted to see what sort of works could Lady Zhao create\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Lady Zhao\u2019s lazy attitude towards literature was just like how she approached learning in general. She was just like everyone other plebian.</p><br/><p>Han Leng realized that there was no way he could harbor any expectations for anything of substance from Lady Zhao. The only way he saw her overcoming this was by her talents alone. If by any chance, did she possess the talents only seen in the realm of Gods, she might nonchalantly produce an enduring masterpiece.</p><br/><p>But how was that possible? She was not a character from a novel who had the ability to break logic. Creation was a gradual process. If anyone could create a great book at leisure, then those ordinary creators who still could not get a taste of fame even after an uncountable amount of years could just drop everything and leave.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was necessary to emphasize that anything can be achieved through hard work. Even if someone was born without a natural gift, hard work made up for it. Then, if someone worked hard their entire life, and yet fail to equal the ability of a talented one at the time of their birth, how frustrating would that be? Just the thought of it was enough to make someone feel depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Zhao Youyue asked with a smile. She was quite satisfied with her performance. Even without any cards activated, her music skills were weighty. This was actually a long-term learning process. After using a character card, no matter what she did, it would leave a piece of itself in the memory of her body. As long as she had the will to practice without the card activated, the effects of it would be good enough.</p><br/><p>Han Leng praised her very sensibly, \u201cNot bad, the singing was good, the guitar was well-played, it was like the temperament of a literary goddess emanating from within you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Han Leng\u2019s opinion, Zhao Youyue\u2019s performance was not as good as the one during New Year\u2019s Day. It lacked some deep-seated, intangible substance. Most importantly, it did not match the style of the Goddess Chu in his mind. As he had initially been eagerly looking forward to it, this left him feeling a little empty.</p><br/><p>However, this alleviated all his suspicions. Previously, when he listened to Zhao Youyue\u2019s music, his imagination had expanded to such a degree that he thought that Chu Luoxun had possessed Zhao Youyue. Otherwise, what else could explain the similarities between their temperaments, even down to the expression of a single note\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was still a little surprised when she heard Han Leng praising her. She thought that The Great Scholar Han of impeccably high standards would start picking on her mistakes, or perhaps blurt out some weird stuff and make things awkward. Unexpectedly, he was starting to get better at mutual commercial flattering.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was a good thing. It showed that she had unobtrusively and imperceptibly changed and molded Han Leng. He was now a far cry from his old self. The old Han Leng was particularly awkward. He often got angry for inexplicable reasons and alienated her in a huff.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt that this was a change for the better, because if Han Leng was still his strange old self, he would offend people too effortlessly. Not everyone was as patient and open-minded as her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, you should start writing.\u201d Zhao Youyue looked like she wanted Han Leng to start \u2018cooking\u2019 for her immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrite what?\u201d Han Leng was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust write something, anything. I want to eat books,\u201d Zhao Youyue said this, then activated the Wen Qingyu card. Her temperament instantly softened.</p><br/><p>Han Leng could only casually write a paragraph. It depicted the scene of Zhao Youyue\u2019s performance just now, and how he felt when he listened to her music. He wrote it colorfully and rhetorically, of course, to hide the tinge of regret in his heart.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue \u201ctasted\u201d it, she commented, \u201cIt was a really delicate and exquisite cake. The cream on the outside tasted good, but the insides were a little disappointing. Yes, it was the kind of disappointment that was associated to not really seeing what you were looking forward to. It seemed like my performance just now didn\u2019t satisfy you, so what you wrote conveyed such a taste to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Han Leng did not take Zhao Youyue\u2019s joke about \u201ceating books\u201d seriously, but after listening to what Zhao Youyue said, it was as if he had seen a ghost. Was this for real? Could she actually \u201ctaste\u201d the thoughts that he had hidden, deep within his heart, as he wrote, just now? That was not possible, right?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue deactivated the Wen Qingyu card and looked at him with a smile, but it only added to his guilt\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue had no intention to spend more time on Han Leng anymore, because she soon saw that the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d was finally making its appearance again, after a long period of absence!</p><br/><p>This meant that she would be able to enter a new world of works tonight, albeit at random.</p><br/><p>What kind of world would this random new world of works be?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

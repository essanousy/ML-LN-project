After all she was able to play a couple of simple songs after only three months of learning. During her winter holiday, besides reading Rosemary\u2019s novel, she immersed herself in violin practice. After a few days, she was able to restore her standard to where she left off. She was thinking that she should take lessons from a well-known teacher, as she confirmed that she would not drop it halfway like how she used to. As such, she decided to discuss this with her parents.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue had put more attention on the Two Dimensional Gate. After tipping Rosemary, she immediately joined all her fan groups. Being a Sect Master, naturally she was looked up by the other fans. Surprisingly, Rosemary was only an admin in those groups instead of a group manager. She even added Rosemary to her favorite list, waiting for the moment he appeared to chat with his fans. She was certain that her status as a Sect Master could easily draw his attention.</p><br/><p>After eight full days, Rosemary had not appeared even once to greet his fans. Zhao Youyue was not sure whether he was too busy, or not interested in any chit-chat groups. He did not even try to be closer with his fans to get some tips. This had rendered Zhao Youyue helpless. In the end, she had known all the fan group managers and even become one group admin, after all she was a tycoon reader of a little fame, \u201cYouyue\u201d.</p><br/><p>At first Zhao Youyue curled her lip at the gold-digging attitude of the\u201dPure Romance\u201d mangaka Su Li. But now, comparing her with Rosemary, she realized that Su Li was actually approachable. If only all authors could treasure the Sect Master readers like Su Li\u2026</p><br/><p>After chatting with the other fans in the group, Zhao Youyue found out that Rosemary always behaved like this. He treated all his fans equally, even the pirated readers, and would not get angry with them. According to a rumor from fans, Master Rosemary did not have to bother about money. His wife was fair, rich and beautiful, and he even owned a villa in the capital city!</p><br/><p>If this rumor is true, why did he even write web novels? Yet he wrote so perfectly!</p><br/><p>If possible, Zhao Youyue would have added Rosemary as a friend to ask for a cameo. What made Zhao Youyue helpless was that the author refused to accept any friend invitations or talk to strangers, just how autistic could this author be?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was having a terrible headache. She felt as if her soul was trapped in the world of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue requested the group manager \u201cWind\u2019s Whisper\u201d to send a message to Rosemary, as she was a friend of Rosemary. The message was that she wanted to know more about Rosemary and have a little chat with him, and if she was happy, she might even tip him a Silver Sect Master.</p><br/><p>The group manager \u201cWind\u2019s Whisper\u201d was a cutie who had managed the fan groups very well. Not to mention, she was one of the few female fans in the group. When the fans could not get in touch with Rosemary, they would always tease \u201cWind\u2019s Whisper\u201d, and nicknamed her, \u201cCute Windy\u201d or \u201cSister Wind\u201d. Zhao Youyue got to know \u201cWind\u2019s Whisper\u201d due to her gender advantage. A lot of fans did not believe that Zhao Youyue was a girl, just because she had never revealed any of her photos or voices. \u201cWind\u2019s Whisper\u201d believed her anyway, which gave Zhao Youyue a very good impression of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind\u2019s Whisper\u201d had successfully delivered Zhao Youyue\u2019s message to Rosemary, she even showed Zhao Youyue a screenshot of the chat history. She was excited at first because Rosemary replied that he would add Youyue to his friend list later. Sadly after a few days, she had yet to receive any friend request from Rosemary\u2026</p><br/><p>For the first time, Zhao Youyue reckoned that asking for a female cameo from an author in real life could be this difficult!</p><br/><p>As if the author was isolated from the world! Rosemary was well known for his low-profile character. He had never made an appearance in public, except the time that he was invited as VIP guest to the TGC event. It was said that he had put all his effort in his novel.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Meanwhile in a luxury condo in the capital city, Ye Hai whose pen name was \u201cRosemary\u201d, was sitting in front of his PC with full attention. If his fans were to see this, they would have thought that he was busy updating his novel. In fact, he was playing \u201cLoL\u201d instead. He felt nothing wrong about this, because he was just seeking inspirations through the game!</p><br/><p>\u201cEternal War\u201d, his self-created original game in his popular novel \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, is actually a kind of MOBA game. Besides one-on-one solo battle, it will be five-versus-five team battle. The map of team battle is similar to \u201cLoL\u201d, with destroying the enemy base as the victory goal. The only difference is, \u201cEternal War\u201d requires players to train their own heroes. Almost every professional player has owned an exclusive hero character equipped with max level divine equipments before entering Eternal War Arena, as that is the basic requirement. After that, they have to participate in team battle, and purchase the unique equipments and buffs in Eternal War through farming in game.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai carefully designed the game \u201cEternal War\u201d. The concept was inspired by a couple of popular RPG games. He created around ten classes in game and designed the battle framework by referring to \u201cLoL\u201d. If someone was to create a game from his \u201cEternal War\u201d, there would be a lot of bugs, and it would not be able to conquer the world like its novel. Anyway, it served perfectly as a game for the main characters novel to show off their talents. After retiring from the game, the main character would lose his unique hero as it was the club property. So he had to train another hero who possessed special abilities with the help of his golden finger. Naturally, the main character was able to show off in the early game.</p><br/><p>In fact, the earlier chapters of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d describing its online battle was rather racy. However all the loyal fans of Rosemary were but the readers of LoL Esports novels, which had caused earlier chapters to be less impactful. If not, how could the ballot riggers strangle a mighty author like him? He assured himself that this works would gain an immense popularity once the novel got into the tournament arc. He was this confident in his writings.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had also discerned this. Perceiving this book as the lower configuration version of \u201cThe King\u2019s Avatar\u201d, she could not wait to participate in this novel to create an iconic female character.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t Ye Hai send Zhao Youyue a friend request?</p><br/><p>Simply because he was busy \u201cgathering materials\u201d for his game. After he finished talking with \u201cWind\u2019s Whisper\u201d, another match had begun. As his QQ friend list was full, he felt troublesome to delete a friend and add her, and simply did not have the time to add a little Sect Master on QQ.</p><br/><p>Putting aside the Silver Sect Master rewards and whether he was lying, just look at the place he lived, thought it was not the villa as mentioned by the rumor, but it must be a high-priced luxury condominium. Would he be in need of a tip that was below 5,000 RMB after tax?</p><br/><p>With his writing skills, he was positive that he would eventually acquire a Golden Sect Master. This is his confidence in his works!</p><br/><p>The 30-year-old author, Ye Hai had always kept a low profile, yet he was mysteriously calm and confident.</p>\n</div>"}

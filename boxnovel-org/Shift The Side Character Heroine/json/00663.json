When the movie began, they realized that the hall was far from full.</p><br/><p>Obviously, many had not came here on an impulse viewing. They were waiting for the reviews of those who have watched it.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Lady Zhao, was not concerned about the movie\u2019s reception. She was only there to defend \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d image.</p><br/><p>As long as she maintained \u201cChu Luoxon\u2019s\u201d image and prevents other actresses from undoing everything she had put into \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d it was a mission success.</p><br/><p>It had been a reasonably loyal adaptation. Of course, some changes were inevitable. In the original work, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had remained hidden, albeit talked about for a long time before she finally made her debut. She did not disappoint. The early parts of the book had been filled with the sweet nothings between those two lovebirds, Lin Meiyue and Gu Yuan\u2026</p><br/><p>In the movie, Chu Luoxun\u2019s role had been further enhanced. The female director seemed to be a diehard Chu Luoxun fan. Perhaps when Zhao Youyue transformed into Chu Luoxun before her eyes, her heart was utterly conquered. It was only natural that Chu Luoxun would gain more screen time.</p><br/><p>What little improvisation implemented had been carried out with passion and love. When the audience saw the incomparably perfect Goddess Chu occupy the big screen, they had drawn a collective breath of awe. For the first time in their lives did they realize that it was possible for a girl with such temperament to appear in a movie.</p><br/><p>Originally, they had merely been curious to see how Zhao Youyue would single-handedly bring the entire project to ruination. However, as the movie went on, they quickly forgot their purpose. They even forgot about the actress who played Chu Luoxun!</p><br/><p>The movie had taken their souls, locked it in a chest, flung into an ocean, its key down the belly of a sea monster, never to be found again. Then there was Chu Luoxun\u2019s music. They were not hearing it live, so what remained of their souls did not have to be doubly taken, but it was still Chu Luoxun\u2019s music!</p><br/><p>A good soundtrack may sometimes leave you in awe, but it did not rob you of your senses\u2026</p><br/><p>The movie \u201cBeautiful April\u201d had been a great success. It had defended Goddess Chu\u2019s iconic image. The audience became completely immersed in the movie. They did not even remember that it was Zhao Youyue who was playing Chu Luoxun!</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun was Chu Luoxun!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s Chu Luoxun in the big screen!</p><br/><p>This was real acting. The difference between an actor and a celebrity was that when the former played a character, they became that character and people would forget who they originally were. When the latter played a character, they would always be themselves. When the audience watched their screenplay, they would see the actor before they see the character.</p><br/><p>The movie ended, all too soon. The audience laughed. The audience cried. The audience was in hysterics, and could no longer tell reality from fiction. It could not be helped. The sweet nothings had been most joyful to behold. The blooming love was the pinnacle of teenage romance. Han Leng\u2019s original work had cleverly thrown a joke here, a jab there, so when the movie faithfully reproduced those scene, the audience had responded with bittersweet smiles.</p><br/><p>But when Chu Luoxun\u2019s terminal illness was finally revealed, when she died on the operating table at the end, floodgates were opened. Some people even cursed the director!</p><br/><p>How could you make one so happy, only to smash that happiness to bits, along with everything else that made us whole?</p><br/><p>Of course, to make matters worst, in the midst of adversity, Chu Luoxun still did not give up on music. Watching it in live-action was almost torturous!</p><br/><p>In any case, this movie inspired the world to get on its feet and press on. Rage against the dying of the light, and the adversity. At the same time, it was down-to-earth and heartfelt. It could make you laugh while you cry, it could make you cry while you laugh. And finally, the music. Ahhh, the music!</p><br/><p>Han Leng, the original author, was astounded. The \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d in the movie had blown him away. The Chu Luoxun he knew had slipped out of the pages of his book and slipped into the film. How else could you explain how she had been the spitting image of the Chu Luoxun from his memories?</p><br/><p>They each returned back to their own homes uneventfully. Only when he was in the comfort of his home, a sudden thought struck his mind!</p><br/><p>He was no different from those netizens. They had all been doubtful of Lady Zhao\u2019s skills.</p><br/><p>Yet there he was, in the cinema, not even realizing that it was Zhao Youyue on the big screen. That\u2019s Chu Luoxun, isn\u2019t it? What\u2019s she doing there?!</p><br/><p>This was godly!</p><br/><p>Can you even call that acting?</p><br/><p>Just like many other teenage and romance movies, reviews determined their fates!</p><br/><p>Once again, the internet stirred. Words like \u201cwork of God\u201d and how it was a milestone in teenage movies flooded the forums. Testimonials of how they cried their eyes out after watching it, and how they had to watch it twice, thrice!</p><br/><p>Only after the emotional rollercoaster had passed, did someone regain enough sense to talk about Zhao Youyue\u2019s acting skills!</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun was not played by an actress, whoever she is. It was Chu Luoxun herself. She has shown up in the movie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe acting was impeccable. It was so convincing, so natural \u2013 it was the highest form of art possible. This is method-acting at a highly dangerous level. The type that you don\u2019t see actors and actresses recovering from. The actress really wanted to make the audience forget who she was and only take notice of the character Chu Luoxun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally thought that Zhao Youyue was only a musician and gamer. I did not expect her to pull that out of her magic hat. Is she really untrained? That movie provides all evidence to the contrary! Why is this so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome acting skills! I don\u2019t have the right words to describe her performance. It was not extremely expressive like Liu Xingxing\u2019s. Zhao Youyue\u2019s acting was introverted and refined, as if she had gone through countless years of training\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQueen of Actresses! If you guys didn\u2019t ask, I wouldn\u2019t even think of giving my review of the movie, because I could not even scrutinize the damn film. I was totally engrossed with the storytelling as it was. Only after several repeated viewings did I finally come to a realization. It was her acting. Her accursed acting, that had my full and undivided attention?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter seeing everyone praise Lady Zhao\u2019s acting skills, my faith is renewed, and I\u2019ve finally seen through the marketing strategy of this movie. The music scenes, the centerpiece of the book, could not have been done any better. Chu Luoxun\u2019s, no, Zhao Youyue\u2019s performance, you could say that she\u2019s a reincarnation of Chu Luoxun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The public opinion was completely reversed. Anyone who initially questioned Lady Zhao\u2019s acting skills instantly vanished. Some of them even turned a full 180 degrees and started praising her brainlessly!</p></div>\n</div>"}

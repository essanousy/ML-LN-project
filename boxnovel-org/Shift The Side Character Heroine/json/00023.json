In the process of copying the letter, she realized that the standard of Han Leng\u2019s writing was spectacular. Not only he did not insert any ostentatious elements, but the entire remorse letter was full of sincerity. With that, Mr Qiu could easily believe that she would no longer scroll her phone during the morning reading class.</p><br/><p>To validate its novelty, Zhao Youyue randomly picked a sentence and searched for it online. Sure enough, Han Leng was not that indolent to copy something from the internet. In other words, these 3,000 words were all composed by Han Leng himself. He had stayed up late and typed the whole thing word by word on his phone\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was pretty much impressed by Han Leng. If it was for her, she would not think on her own about what was available on the internet; in fact, copying online could already be bothersome for her. Simply because one could not copy exactly from a single source, instead, the contents had to be copied from a variety of other sources.</p><br/><p>Such annoyance! She had assumed that Han Leng could have copied it from somewhere. Unbelievably, he wrote it all on his own. It was no wonder for him to become a web novelist, as he had such a remarkable talent.</p><br/><p>Well, remember when Mr. Qiu requested a 3,000-word remorse letter from Youyue, she would rather give up her phone than writing it\u2026.</p><br/><p>An unusual happiness rose upon her in today\u2019s morning reading class, as expected, Mr. Qiu recalled that he had confiscated Youyue\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>Ever since Zhao Youyue lost her phone, her vigilance had been rather high. She was like a humanoid radar. Anytime would Mr.Qiu cunningly enter the class from the backdoor, despite not making any sound, Youyue had already kept her new phone in a split second. She would then pretend to be reciting \u201cAn Exhortation to Learning\u201d by Xun Zi, a Chinese philosopher. Sitting square with a solemn expression and in a laudable demeanour, she turned over her book against the table, and began reciting.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe gentleman says, \u2018Learning must never stop. Blue dye is gotten from the indigo plant, and yet it is bluer than the plant. Ice comes from water, and yet it is colder than water. Through steaming and bending, you can make wood straight as a plumb line into a wheel. And after its curve conforms to the compass, even when parched under the sun it will not become straight again, because the steaming and bending have made it a certain way. Likewise, when wood comes under the ink-line, it becomes straight\u2026\u2019 \u201d</p><br/><p>Her deskmate, Zhou Fang gazed at her in amazement, and thought, this girl had always played with her phone whenever she was free. Be it language class or English morning reading class, as long as the teacher was not around; and today, Youyue, who had never taken any initiative to flip a book, was adopting a new style. It was incredulous to Zhou Fang that she was able to recite \u201cAn Exhortation to Learning\u201d so fluently. Zhou Fang could yet to even read it smoothly, not to mention, it was not taught in class before!</p><br/><p>This is so unscientific!</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhou Fang would not know that Zhao Youyue was a hardcore scholar inside her \u201cdreams\u201d. With that, she had been drifting around lately without paying much attention to her studies during daytime. Appearing to be a rather quack student, it was rather worrisome to the rest that during examination, she might plunge from her chronicle middle ranking to the very bottom.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Fang could not bear her curiosity further and was about to consult Youyue, a familiar figure had stood aside, it was the class teacher Mr Qiu!</p><br/><p>Growing anxious all of a sudden, Zhou Fang stumbled over \u201cAn Exhortation to Learning\u201d. What an embarrassment, she could not believe that Youyue continued to recite it beside her, articulately. She seemed to know more than a stanza. Wait, she had literally memorized the whole poem!</p><br/><p>That was preposterous!</p><br/><p>The striking contrast between the both of them, plus the class teacher Mr Qiu who watched from aside; Zhou Fang\u2019s face turned so red that she felt like burying her head in the sand pit.</p><br/><p>Moved by her charming personality, Zhou Fang had considered Zhao Youyue as her very own friend. Unlike most of the girls who are fussy about the trifles, Youyue was amiable, adorable, yet equipped with an elegant manner. Whenever she smiled, her mouth was always covered with her beautiful hand. Seeing that delightful smile of hers could actually enlighten the mood of someone.</p><br/><p>However, she definitely frowned upon Youyue\u2019s attitude in her studies. It is not that Youyue did not study at all, but she seemed to happy-go-lucky and paid no heed to her studies. That was a bit thick for Zhou Fang.</p><br/><p>Besides, she was rather irritated by the two guys sitting at their front, who would talk nothing other than magazines and games. Whenever the class was over, they would turn around and chat with Zhao Youyue, showing her all kinds of tricks, and telling their lame jokes, as she had been giving a pleasantful response. Well, that was actually how she treated everyone, she was pretty much a tender and friendly girl. If it was Zhou Fang herself, she would care less about such guys who were not handsome and had scored bad results. Never would she understand how Zhao Youyue was able to remain calm and cheerful at all times!</p><br/><p>Anyway, she had to consent, that deep inside her heart, she was jealous of the saint personality of Zhao Youyue, and her sociability of course. Those qualities were quite out of her league. She was even afraid to speak too much to guys, fearing that she would get into rumors\u2026 In fact, this is her mere delusion. She was not pretty in the first place. Too bad, no one had mentioned this saddening truth to her.</p><br/><p>Zhou Fang was a diligent girl, and her results was quite satisfying. Aware of her average appearance, lack of specialty, as well as her ordinary family background, she had casted all her lots towards studying, hoping that her excellence in studies could retain her sense of superiority over Zhao Youyue\u2026</p><br/><p>But now, she could hardly take it that she was surpassed by Zhao Youyue in studies. Perhaps that was just an accident, or an exceptional case.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yingchun was waiting for Zhao Youyue to finish reciting \u201cAn Exhortation to Learning\u201d. He then pounded on her table contentedly and called her out to the front of the class. He commended, \u201cZhao Youyue\u2019s performance during the morning reading class was impressive. She must have paid a lot of effort, or else she could not have recited \u201cAn Exhortation to Learning\u201d so fluently. I knew it Youyue, you are a good girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue smiled gently as a gesture of accepting his compliment. Indeed, she was hardworking in the Two Dimensional Gate.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qiu Yingchun mentioned about the remorse letter, not in a stern tone this time. He was pretty much satisfied with her performance just now.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue acted as if she had just recalled the issue, and responded embarrassingly, \u201cMr Qiu, I was done with the remorse letter actually. Sorry, I forgot to hand in to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, she dashed to her seat, then took the remorse letter and handed in to Qiu Yingchun. Amid the process, she instinctively peeked at Han Leng, just to discover that he was alternately forcing his eyes opened for reading, and falling back asleep. Thus, his head was shaking up and down, how peculiar! In fact, he was in the stage between sleeping and awaking, that could avoid the suspicion of teacher. It was indeed the signature move of the \u201cGod of Sleep\u201d.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing Zhao Youyue\u2019s neat writing and clean remorse letter, without looking through the letter contents, Qiu Yingchun had come to confirmation that Youyue had utterly introspected on her own misbehaviour. He thus took a glance. Wow, such remarkable writing talent and sincere words, not bad at all!</p><br/><p>Having commended her a little more, he returned Youyue\u2019s phone back to her at ease, and allowed her to return to her seat. He then walked back to the office, and planned to ambush the students again when the morning reading class was about to end\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue cracked a sly smile, and went back to her desk joyfully. She casually put her old phone into her 6,000 RMB Chloe bag, and took out her new phone. Activating her humanoid radar again, she realized Mr. Qiu had been faraway from the class. So, she began playing her phone recklessly. Based on her recent analysis, he would most likely come back in seven minutes before the end of morning class. If she could keep her phone in nine minutes earlier than that, and pretended to be reciting some literatures again, she would definitely be safe!</p>\n</div>"}

He packed a bunch of snacks, and had planned to stay until the end of the rehearsal. His eyes were on his phone all the time, bored of those same performances on stage during every rehearsal.</p><br/><p>The next piano solo would be done by the president of Student Union, Huang Zongchao, with the track, \u201cMarriage D\u2019Amour.\u201d If he were to judge that performance, at most, it would be \u201con point,\u201d words like \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201csoul-touching\u201d were impossible to match with it.</p><br/><p>Despite it, Wang Shun knew that Huang Zongchao always put in his full effort in his studies, the piano was merely his hobby. He should be praised for achieved the \u201con point\u201d level, but you would never expect to get Richard Clayderman out of him.</p><br/><p>The unfamiliar track diverted Wang Shun\u2019s attention from his phone to the stage. Instead of Huang Zongchao, there was a beautiful young girl with silky long hair, dressed in a school uniform.</p><br/><p>That was clearly the uprising star in school, supposedly the prettiest girl in school, Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>Even Wang Shun, a Grade 3 senior heard of this Grade 2 junior\u2019s name, Zhao Youyue. She excelled academically, and she had performed exceptionally well in the previous school sports competition. Her speeches under the national flag in front of all students were solid and inspiring, striking close to heart.</p><br/><p>Someone had finally matched Huang Zongchao as a remarkable individual as a Grade 2 student, while being far more beautiful and elegant, to boot.</p><br/><p>This young girl was supposed to play the violin, wasn\u2019t she, why was she playing the piano, now? Wang Shun could not wrap his mind around it.</p><br/><p>Wang Shun might be an art student, but he was aware of Zhao Youyue\u2019s achievements. She was the champion of Provincial Music Competition, and her skills had managed to get her into the finalist of National Music Competition. He was jealous to learn that she had such attained such an achievement before she was even out of Grade 2, while he had only managed to get bronze in Provincial Music Competition.</p><br/><p>Yet, after a few times of watching her rehearsal, he only had one word for it. Perfunctory. There was no passion, her performance was just like a puppet with strings, but without soul. A glitch-free, bland performance like this would only impress laymen.</p><br/><p>Wang Shun also knew that his sworn rival, Hang Yongming often vigorously defended this young girl Zhao Youyue to great lengths</p><br/><p>It was a pity Hang Yongming wasn\u2019t here, his expression while indulging himself in Zhao Yongyue\u2019s performance would be entertaining.</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming always left right after he rehearsed, he would never be a minute too late.</p><br/><p>Wang Shun did not pay much heed to it at the beginning; he had his doubts about this violinist\u2019s skill on the piano. Furthermore, he could not tell which song she was playing; it was difficult to judge the performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cB comme Brise\u201d was written by Chu Luoxun, a character in a novel, as a tribute to Richard Clayderman\u2019s \u201cA comme Amour,\u201d which portrayed the warm romance of a fairytale in autumn. \u201cB comme Brise\u201d was an expression of Spring by Chu Luoxun. It was soft and soothing, a song you would listen right before going to bed, just like a cradle rocking our minds into neverland.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue activated the \u201cChu Luoxun card\u201d within her, playing the song with so much emotion, that it released the mysterious aura of \u201cspiritual music.\u201d Those who were listening with their hearts were dragged into her \u201cMusical Reality Marble.\u201d [1]</p><br/><p>Wang Shun propped his body up all at once; his ears perked up. He almost could see Zhao Youyue and the piano being surrounded by beds of flowers, as the notes of the music materialized as she pressed each key on the piano. They shimmered briefly in the air before they morphed into pink petals of a flower, and billowed across the hall!</p><br/><p>Wang Shun lifted his arms and embraced the wave, all at once forgetting that it was he who had once mocked the descriptions depicted in Beautiful April. Such a scene was when the lead male character performed on the piano.</p><br/><p>Yet now, that thought was fluffed out of his mind. He almost felt the flowers he lay on them in this world of music, a world where blossoming flower beds stretched over the horizon. Spring had transformed itself into a beautiful young girl who looked like Zhao Youyue, humming nursery rhymes to his ears, persuading him to close his eyes, into a neverending dream.</p><br/><p>Noises clattered around the hall, but as Zhao Youyue\u2019s music dug deeper to its heart, almost everyone was dragged along with it. Some of Grade 1 students immediately broke off from the idle chatter, and were now mesmerized by Zhao Youyue who had cut herself free on the piano.</p><br/><p>Huang Zongchao was acting strangely as well. Before Zhang Youyue went onto the stage, he had pulled out his lecture notes of some competition and continued to study the questions, claiming he was not as free as Zhao Youyue. He should be on schedule for competition practice tonight, but he had to postpone it just for rehearsal. Therefore he had to put in some extra effort to remain ahead of the game.</p><br/><p>That was the plan, at least. Currently, there was nothing related to the questions of that competition in his mind, only blossoming flowers and divine warmth, as he floated to the sky, like a butterfly!</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] Reality Marble, from TYPE-MOON\u2019s Fate series, is the ability to create and maintain a set of worlds based on their characteristics within a bounded field, anyone within the range will be encased and completely cut off from reality, since the real world had been shrunk and kept into the World Egg.

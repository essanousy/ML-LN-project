He only ended up getting in the way.</p><br/><p>She only got wounded attempting to save him. The game abruptly cut into a CG cutscene. It demonstrated the swordswoman\u2019s valiant attempts at saving him without any regard for her own wound.</p><br/><p>Realization quickly dawned upon Wu Shun. This swordswoman in grey was not some random, generic NPC she was a relatively important plot character. You don\u2019t dedicate entire CG scenes to common NPCs.</p><br/><p>Experienced players could instantly tell. The more CG animations a character is given, the more important the character had to be!</p><br/><p>The grey swordswoman had pushed Wu Shun\u2019s character down, shielding him, only to suffer a relatively ferocious wound to her back</p><br/><p>The cutscene had been played from first-person view. He helped the female swordsman up. That was when he caught a glimpse of her face beneath the hood</p><br/><p>Wu Shun gulped. The comments on the bullet curtain went into a frenzy. No one had expected the face beneath the hood to be so beautiful.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was even more beauty in how she had absolutely no reaction or regard to her own wound!</p><br/><p>Wu Shun was initially prepared for death. He had not expected to survive such an encounter. It was just a game, but it also provided an experience similar to \u201cSuspension Bridge Reaction\u201d[1]. As he gazed into the female swordsman\u2019s face again, his heart started beating at insane speeds. This was the sensation of falling in love!</p><br/><p>Actually, the swordswoman\u2019s face was never fully revealed. According to Zhao Youyue\u2019s set up, as a wanted fugitive and terrorist, Jane Doe Su should be covering her entire face, only leaving her eyes exposed. However, the game producer Zha Feng had not considered this attractive enough. He had made the slightest of changes to it\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su\u2019s face-concealing veil was turned into a blindfold. Her eyes had been completely covered, but the drop-dead gorgeous lower half of her face was displayed for the world to view.</p><br/><p>There were few relatively iconic representatives for In-game female characters with veils or blindfolds in another world. They were all highly popular in their own right. For example, the beautiful and gentle girl 2B within \u201cNier Automata,\u201d and also \u201cThe Fire Keeper\u201d within \u201cDark Souls 3\u201d. With blindfolds, their charm factor shot up to the next level!</p><br/><p>According to Zhihu, such blindfolds often appeared in all kinds of books that involved various sorts of shameful plays. This \u201ccovered eyes\u201d hobby had a specific name, and would be found in a specific type of book. It was an excellent design choice that would turn on the most hardcore otakus, as proven by the beautiful and gentle 2B. The psychological analysis related to the imagery of \u201cveils\u201d could be seen in professional books.</p><br/><p>No one knew what inspired an \u201cintoxicated\u201d Zha Feng to incorporate a blindfold. Nevertheless, the change had instantly created a sense of visual impact on Jane Doe Su\u2019s face. With only the lower half of her face revealed, she would be able to seduce players to the extreme!</p><br/><p>Of course, her hair was grayish, standing out in sharp contrast to the black blindfold.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Zha Feng had been awe-struck by Jane Doe Su, or he found such a trait highly useful. Therefore, all his upcoming games would feature all sorts of eye-covered characters, regardless of the gender.</p><br/><p>In fact, he had even designed various blindfolds for Jane Doe Su. They were somewhere in the game, who knows where. Perhaps they were in the \u201cAvatar Changer\u201d? You could earn the blindfolds via achievements, or you could just buy them with cash.</p><br/><p>Such was how games ran these days. Single-Player games often incorporated in-game purchases. Most purchases would be purely aesthetics. They would not destroy the balance of the game, but were able to beautify the game. At the same time, players could support their favorite game companies. Why not?</p><br/><p>Whether this meant that Jane Doe Su was blind, Zha Feng declined to comment on it. It was her unique method for sword training. She even had the \u201ceye of the heart,\u201d and had learned the \u201csword of the heart.\u201d With her eyes hidden from the world, Jane Doe Su would be limiting herself. Taking off this \u2018limiter\u2019 would be akin to her going through a transformation, much like the multi-stage boss fights</p><br/><p>Zha Feng was satisfied with the finalized result. He treated Jane Doe Su as his own daughter. People would eventually remember her. But the price that had to be paid for that</p><br/><p>The CG cutscene finally ended. Wu Shun found that he yet another sidequest had been activated \u2013 treating the wound of the mysterious swordwoman in grey. Firstly, he had to bring her to a safe place. Then, he had to collect herbs somewhere, and hand them over to ahighly skilled doctor.This augured the imminence of another quest chain. Of course, throughout the process, players would form a deeper bond with Jane Doe Su.</p><br/><p>When the players\u2019 love towards a female character was it at highest, that would be the ideal moment to separate them from the lady, regardless of how you do that. It would be an extremely painful, heartbreaking matter</p><br/><p>Wu Shun originally intended to \u201ckill her and steal her treasure.\u201d That thought was just a fleeting shadow, now that he had already been bewitched by her beauty. His mind was now possessed by the single-minded goal of obtaining her favorability. He no longer cared about anything else, not even the beautiful and gentle Yan Qingmeng!</p><br/><p>Wu Shun took the initiative to start a conversation with the girl. He found that the girl had even been equipped with a voice actor. He spoke to the audiences excitedly, \u201cThis girl has to be a big shot! She even has VA. Wow! That voice is so ethereal, it\u2019s simply perfect! Sadly, it\u2019s notoriously difficult getting just a few words from her. But, I like such her. She\u2019s a silent, expressionless, cold character!\u201d</p><br/><p>The viewers chipped in, \u201cThis mysterious character is definitely up to something.\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s probably even more charming than Yan Qingmeng.\u201d\u201dHer swordsmanship was just out of this world.\u201d A chant soon started, demanding that Wu Shun treated her wound.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu Shun was wide awake. He was suddenly confident that he would be able to play for another ten hours. Dropping dead all of a sudden suddenly fled to a dark, hidden corner of his head!</p><br/><p>Wu Shun pursued the sidequest like a maniac. He almost completely ignored the main questline. Anyway, both the royal administration of the Kingdom of Zhao and the opposite party behind the scene had yet to offer him any notion of a good impression</p><br/><p>This world had nothing but tasteless, heartless wretches.</p><br/><p>No. This nameless blind girl was an exception. She was the angel who had just saved his life!</p><br/><p>Someone has to say it. Wu Shun was borderline schizophrenic. He put himself into the game at a level that no one ever could. Perhaps the game was far too dark and depressing. Therefore, whenever anything treated him with a semblance of kindness, he would be a sucker for it. Of course, this female character was dropdead gorgeous. She was an otaku-slayer!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Suspension Bridge Reaction \u2013 When a person is crossing a suspension bridge with fear, his heartbeat will speed up. If at this moment, this person coincidentally meets another person of the opposite sex, he will misunderstand this heartbeat reaction, bearing in mind that such physiological reaction is due to his heart being attracted by that person, therefore having affection towards that person.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

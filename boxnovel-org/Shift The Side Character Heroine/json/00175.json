You must look at the music score carefully and keep practicing; then you\u2019ll be able to play well. Just follow the music score and your musician\u2019s heart, and you should be able to play it perfectly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not playing correctly again! How many times do I have to repeat myself? No sleep for you until you get it right! It\u2019s already written clearly on the music score, take a better look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Whenever Gu Yuan shuts his eyes, he would hear his late mother\u2019s teachings, reminding him of his glorious, yet dark past.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Yuan got the first place again\u2026 After all, his mother is a famous musician; it must be in his genes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis glasses were almost touching the music score, is he trying to cover up his wound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does he play if he has to practice seven to eight hours per day? Not everyone can take that kind of stress\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looked a machine! A humanoid metronome!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan always hears those comments while he was young, but it never bothered him, because he took all that as nonsense. He had the perfect mother by his side, he was not afraid of anything, and he could keep playing the piano.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, Gu Yuan was struggling with nervousness. As he read the music score, his fingers were shaking; he thought he should have spent more time practicing, so that he could play it by heart, because he was going to perform with a stranger, together!</p><br/><p>What worried him the most was\u2026 he was performing with a reckless, improvising violinist!</p><br/><p>After witnessing how Chu Luoxin performed during her last competition, he more or less knew what sort of musician she was. She never treated it as a competition in the first place, she would play the violin however she wanted to, as long as it pleased her!</p><br/><p>Honestly, her style was completely different from Gu Yuan, because he had the nickname of the \u201cHumanoid Metronome,\u201d he was famous for being able to play note-by-note, precise, down to the last beat. He would never take any liberties with the piece, he would only get scolded by his mother if he does that.</p><br/><p>As Gu Yuan was practicing nervously, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d appeared with her beautiful gown, \u201cI\u2019m ready! Let\u2019s just dive in and see how it goes! Our rendition!\u201d She beamed as she said those lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is madness\u2026 I can never perform in such a condition!\u201d Gu Yuan was struggling with the music score, trying to practice as much as he could.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I look good in this dress? It was tailor-made for me!\u201d Chu Luoxun was excited, since Gu Yuan had agreed to be her partner, she had become even more lively and energetic, she was grinning all the time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should just forfeit the competition; we will only embarrassing ourselves\u2026\u201d Gu Yuan still stared at the ground, mumbling to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d became angry when she realized that Gu Yuan was not paying attention to her, so she tugged at his necktie and gave him a good old headbutt. Of course, this was all written in a playful manner in the novel\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that? Have you calmed down?\u201d Chu Luoxun said grumpily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck are you doing!\u201d Gu Yuan snapped, because he was still feeling nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d lowered her face down to Gu Yuan, foreheads almost touching, \u201cLook at me! Lift your head up and look at me. Your head is always down, as if the musical notes have imprisoned you\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, I know you can do it, you\u2019ve been listening to that song for the whole afternoon, haven\u2019t you? The music sheet is just right in front of you too\u2026 We can do this!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d revealed her brilliant smile once again, \u201cMozart once told me from above the sky\u2026 Don\u2019t worry and carry on with your journey, do not be afraid of embarrassing yourself! Even if we do embarrass ourselves, we\u2019ll be in it together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan was staring at \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d smiling face, and he felt his heart racing for no reason, as if he had just met this girl, the girl who had the blessing of a musical God.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the competition staff came over, \u201cNo.14, Miss Chu Luoxun, please get ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d smiled and grabbed Guy Yuan\u2019s hand naturally, and jogged towards the stage. Gu Yuan looked at her beautiful long hair that gave out a sweet fragrance, her bare shoulder courtesy of her single strapped dress, it was such beauty\u2026</p><br/><p>The strict teachings of his mother that had long taken thrall over him were replaced by a beautiful and shining sunlight, \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaive and whimsical, just like a roller coaster, she always spins me silly, she doesn\u2019t even know where she was heading\u2026\u201d Gu Yuan muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Freedom!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Music is freedom,\u201d as if she had heard Gu Yuan\u2019s inner voice, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d turned her head toward Gu Yuan just before she went on stage, and she still had that dazzling smile on her face.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been awhile since Gu Yuan returned to the stage, and he had been dragged back to the stage by this girl, he had mixed emotion blossoming about</p><br/><p>Everyone was waiting for their performance, because the theater was completely silent!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s carry on, shall we? Saint Saens\u2019 waiting for us!\u201d Chu Luoxun grabbed her violin and stepped forward on the stage elegantly.</p><br/><p>Some of the audience members had noticed Gu Yuan, and some of them thought that he looked familiar, they were all guessing his identity\u2026</p><br/><p>A famous judge was talking to himself, \u201cI\u2019ve waited long enough, Chu Luoxun, eh? Hm, she changed her partner, a student? I feel like I\u2019ve seen him from somewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that accompaniment Gu Yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s Gu Yuan? I could barely recognize him after all these years. That genius pianist Gu Yuan, do both of them know each other? Why is he performing together with her?\u201d The other judge seemed confused.</p><br/><p>The famous judge who had high expectations on Chu Luoxun was thinking to himself, \u201cAn uncoordinated combination of a natural and an artificial musician, what kind of performance will they bring out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d performed, she closed her eyes and took a breath, \u201cDieu de la musique, s\u2019il vous plat coutez mon appel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d turned and nodded at Gu Yuan. After blinking at his face, she could not help herself but laughed at him, \u201cYour expression is too stiff!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is for the genius violinist, Pablo de Sarasate, Saint Saens\u2019 Overture and Rotary Caprice\u2026\u201d Gu Yuan muttered to himself as he started performing.</p>\n</div>"}

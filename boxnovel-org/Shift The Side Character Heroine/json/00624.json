Olivia, who had a new father, appeared to be even more disliked by her grandmother, Queen Calanthe. She felt that Olivia\u2019s actions meant something like \u2018recognizing a thief as your own father.\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter what, Crach, who was responsible for receiving the Princess of Cintra\u2019s family was also responsible for this loss.</p><br/><p>Queen Calanthe was certain that Olivia\u2019s \u2018gentle\u2019 personality would never bring her anywhere in life. The only person who could succeed to the throne of the Kingdom of Cintra and rule over the Kingdom was her eldest grandchild \u2013 Cillira.</p><br/><p>At first, Olivia began to receive a traditional standard of education together with Cirilla. However, such lessons did not benefit her. She had already learned much from Vilgefortz.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she came up with an excuse of a \u2018frail constitution\u2019 to skip on her classes. In reality, she was reading from the magic books that Lydia had been left to her. She even started dabbling in Alchemy\u2026 If she had sufficient skill points, mastery was no problem.</p><br/><p>To everyone, the little Princess Olivia who was originally a genius became completely useless after her parents\u2019 deaths. In stark contrast was Cirilla, who increasingly gave off the aura of an older sister.</p><br/><p>If Cirilla did not have Olivia, the \u2018weak and delicate\u2019 younger sister, she might still have been the same as before; a brat, pampered by Queen Calanthe. Even if her parents\u2019 died, she could still grow up peacefully under her grandmother\u2019s wing.</p><br/><p>Now, the \u2018weak and delicate\u2019 younger sister made Cirilla become mature than before. Everyone needed a reason to become stronger. Protecting your closed ones would be one of those reasons that were so awe-inspiring, righteous and incomparably great, glorious, and righteous.</p><br/><p>The sisters became inseparable. When they were little, Cirilla had always set off Olivia with her mischief. Now Olivia was receiving the fruits of her efforts. She used her \u2018demure appearance\u2019 to bring out the best of Cirilla\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Cirilla quickly rose up in ranks among the aristocratic children of her age. It was not her appearance that brought her there, which could not be compared to her sister\u2019s beauty.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that Cirilla, the strong Princess of Cintra had a very, very sore spot \u2013 her sister. If anyone ever remotely threw a slur at her sister\u2019s name, she would fly into rage. She would try her best to obtain anything her sister wanted, no matter how rare it was.</p><br/><p>Many felt that Olivia, the younger sister, was too spoiled and pampered for her own good. In reality, Cirilla knew that her sister was putting up some sort of front.</p><br/><p>In conclusion, as long as her sister was by her side, Cirilla felt unstoppable. Nothing would stand before them.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was what we call a \u2018sister complex.\u2019 In the past and present world and this boundless universe, who knows how many incredibly powerful people had a sister complex. They would destroy the world for their sister, or save the entire world for their sister. There was nothing odd about it \u2013 like eating and drinking.</p><br/><p>Even though Olivia seemed pampered to other people, she drew in another form of attention. The potential-daughter-in-law-to-get-into-someone\u2019s-good-graces kind. Furthermore, if you add in Olivia\u2019s beauty and elegant aura, she formed the image of a perfect princess!</p><br/><p>Luckily, her sister Cirilla was always around the corner. If not, some same-aged boys who definitely try to bully Olivia. That was the only way little boys knew how to express their emotions.</p><br/><p>Six years went by in a flash, and Olivia was ten years old. The birthday that Queen Calanthe had held in honor of Cirilla\u2019s tenth year, anyone could see that she favored her more than anyone. It was as if Queen Calanthe had already set her eyes on Cirilla as the successor to the throne of the Kingdom of Cintra.</p><br/><p>As Cirilla grew, her sister molded her into a sharp blade. No matter what world it was, no one should underestimate the manipulative abilities of Olivia (Lady Zhao).</p><br/><p>If six years passed by in the Source World, it would only be equivalent to three days in the real world. To, Zhao Youyue she was playing some cutting-edge VRRPG game. She was barely out of the game\u2019s first chapter. Her abilities as a child were limited. The curtains would unfurl as she approaches adolescence.</p><br/><p>At ten-years-old, Olivia became drop-dead gorgeous. This was to be expected, as she carried the \u2018Pearl of the Northern Kingdoms\u2019 title. The Princes of the Northern Kingdoms had their eyes set on this beautiful Princess of Cintra. Rumors had it that she was extremely gentle and courteous. Her only flaw would be her frail constitution, which needed caring for\u2026</p><br/><p>Many Princes stepped up. They wanted to marry the \u2018Pearl of the Northern Kingdoms.\u2019</p><br/><p>They enthusiastically attended the tenth birthday banquet of the Princess Olivia. In this era where a 15-year-old could marry and have kids, ten-year-olds became legal romantic options.</p><br/><p>Olivia was uninterested in the men of this era. There were many Princes out there, but they were not the perfect Princes from fairytales. They were far from handsome, let alone possessed extraordinary powers. The only man she felt remotely attractive until now was her first teacher \u2013 Vilgefortz.</p><br/><p>He could maintain the perfect, dashing dilf-like appearance that remained at 35 years old for all eternity. He was abnormally handsome, and those so-called Princes could not even be compared to him. In reality, he was a supercentenarian.</p><br/><p>Since her sister was there to cover for her, she slipped away from her own birthday banquet. She brought some drawing materials along and went to the Brokilon [1] to sketch. This was a huge ancient forest that was surrounded by the Cintra, Brugge [2], Sodden [3] and Verden [4]. It was inhabited by dryads, hamadryads, leprechauns, and pucks.</p><br/><p>This were treacherous lands for humans, as dryads tended to fire arrows at them without warning. They treated the Scoia\u2019ta [5] with far less hostility. They evevn allowed them to hide in Brokilon and tended to their wounded.</p><br/><p>The Brokilon dryads were led by Queen Eithn\u00e9 [6], who lived in Du\u00e9n Canell [7], at the center of the forest.</p><br/><p>It was forbidden to bring in fire into the forest; axes or anything that could harm a tree. Furthermore, the Brokilon were also famous for their unique potions. For example, combining the roots of Conynhaela [8] and the symbiotic roots of the knitbone [9] enabled the rapid regeneration of damaged or broken bones.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Olivia knew better than to stray into the depths of the forest. She remained at the edge of their borders, sketching away. She had been doing this for many years already. Cirilla would sometimes accompany her sister, admiring the figure that remained ever so still, lost in her craft. Olivia had drawn several paintings for her sister.</p><br/><p>One of the most interesting paintings was one that depicted Cirilla who had been forced to wear the Princess\u2019 dress. She was fuming with rage, producing a visage that was both cute and ugly. Olivia had not let such an opportunity pass. This could be the \u2018darkest history\u2019 of Cirilla.</p><br/><p>However, Cirilla was not here to accompany Olivia today. Her little sister had sold her out, and she had to deal with the nobles at the birthday banquet.</p><br/><p>Olivia did not expect to meet someone as she was sketching. This person had white hair and carried two swords on his back\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cBrokilon\u201d () also known among humans as the Forest of Death, is an ancient forest located between Verden, Cidaris, Brugge, and Temeria and is near Dol Adalatte.</p><br/><p>[2] \u201cBrugge\u201d () was a small kingdom, now vassal state, on the Old Road.

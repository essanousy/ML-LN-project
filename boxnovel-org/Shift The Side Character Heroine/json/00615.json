She had not expected to turn into a newborn baby girl here!</p><br/><p>This was nothing like how she became an unconscious girl in the supernatural source world. She was a nobody. In this Western Fantasy, she was nobility. This was a good start\u2026 She could not complain about this. This time, she might actually fulfill her \u201cempress dream!\u201d</p><br/><p>What works would she inspire? Would she become a hapless creator\u2019s inspiration and be instantly made into an iconic female character?</p><br/><p>She finally got to know her name \u2014- \u2014- Olivia Fiona Elen Riannon.</p><br/><p>Olivia was a pretty nice name. It meant \u201ca domineering, smart, and perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>In such a Western medieval fantasy world that contained swords and magic, the name of aristocrats were often far too lengthy. Although Zhao Youyue was aware of that, she still found her name too \u201cMary Sue-ish.\u201d Was this her counterpart in this world?</p><br/><p>A name like \u201cThe Paladin Zhang Daniu\u201d[1] would be most down-to-earth\u2026</p><br/><p>Fortunately, people did not normally refer to others by their full names. Just \u201cOlivia\u201d was fine. People close to her could also call her \u201cViya,\u201d which was far more simple. It was just like how she called her sister Cirilla \u201cCiri.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zhao Youyue made up her mind to claim the throne, she suddenly realized that an exclamation mark had appeared at the upper right corner of her sight. She used her little hands to tap it open. It felt like she was playing a VR game!</p><br/><p>After running in circles for so long, was this the source world of iconic Western fantasy games? Was she already part of the system?</p><br/><p>After tapping the exclamation mark open, she found a quest window which contained \u201cmain quests,\u201d \u201csecondary quests,\u201d \u201ctreasure hunts\u201d and \u201ccontracts\u201d on it\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, her main quest was, \u201cEmpress\u2019 Ambition\u201d \u2014- \u2014- to unify the \u201cWorld of the Witcher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this world called the World of the Witcher?</p><br/><p>As a veteran web novel reader, Zhao Youyue first thought of a famous web novel in another world called \u201cWorld of the Witcher,\u201d written by a genius author with the pen name \u201cGo Away.\u201d Never once did she think of the famous single-player, \u201cWitcher\u201d game series. The players ridiculed the developers as \u201cfoolish Polish.\u201d But their goodwill eventually got to the players, many who originally pirated the game ended up getting their own genuine copies. Most famous of all was \u201cThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\u201d \u201cCirilla\u201d was one of the most important characters in this game.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Zhao Youyue had not played this game yet. Otherwise, when she learned that her sister in this world was \u201cCirilla,\u201d she would get a firm grasp on her situation.</p><br/><p>Now, she still believed that this world a the fusion of many familiar Western fantasy elements, like the supernatural source world. Maybe, it had \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d and such. These were so-called examples of \u201ccontemporary Western fantasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, it did not matter if she had not yet played the game. Zhao Youyue soon discovered that there was more than just a \u201cquest window.\u201d She also had an inventory, map, bestiary, character information\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, her inventory was empty. The map was still blacked out. The bestiary was empty. However, under character information, there were already four names, Calanthe, Pavetta, Emhyr, and Cirilla, respectively titled grandmother, mother, father, and sister.</p><br/><p>There, she could read their entire life\u2019s story from birth to present. Cirilla had the least information to offer. After all, she was only one year older than her sister Olivia. Her grandmother and the mother had a few paragraph\u2019s worth of information. On the other hand, her father Emhyr\u2019s offered an entire novel.</p><br/><p>When Emhyr was 13 years old, the capital of the southern Nilfgaardian Empire became the stage of a coup led by an influential aristocrat. Emhyr\u2019s father, Emperor Fergus var Emreis, was overthrown and the aristocrat had seized the throne. Fergus had refused to admit the legitimacy of the coup and thus, was tortured. To break him, the usurper also ordered the mage to torture his son and heir \u2014- \u2014- Emhyr. One of the sorcerers named Braathens \u2013 a smart alec had \u201ccleverly\u201d turned Emhyr into a hedgehog-like monster \u2014- \u2014- urcheon.</p><br/><p>After some time, Emhyr finally drifted his way to Cintra. He adopted the moniker Duny. He had claimed to be the Prince of Maecht and the son of Akerspaark. He was relieved of his curse with the help of the Witcher Geralt. Following that, he successfully married the Cintra Princess Pavetta, and handsomely rewarded the Witcher.</p><br/><p>Geralt specifically asked for the \u201claw of surprise.\u201d The so-called \u201claw of surprise\u201d was a baby who was closely linked to the person who made the promise. This was a method of paying a debt of gratitude. Anyone who wanted to use the law of surprise had to say something like \u201cwhat you find at home yet don\u2019t necessarily seek\u201d when they hear someone vow to give them something. This sentence referred neither to the lover who was hiding under the wife\u2019s bed, nor the mother-in-law who suddenly paid a visit, but a child who was born or adopted while the swearing person was absent. It was said that children like these had world-changing futures ahead of them.</p><br/><p>Emhyr found his wife pregnant after giving such an oath. That child would then be given to Geralt. Her name was Cirilla.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was certain that her cheap father had a dream of reviving the country. He was most ambitious. He probably wanted to become the Emperor of the vast southern Nilfgaardian Empire, no matter what. Now, he was just biding his time.</p><br/><p>Of course, behind him stood a supporter named \u201cVilgefortz.\u201d He was an extremely powerful mage. Under his guidance, Emhyr had been able to rise to the throne and that was where he held his position firmly.</p><br/><p>The \u201ccharacter information\u201d function of this game was simply too convenient. It gave her the means to pull strings and blackmail her way up the entire world, not just this little empire!</p><br/><p>Well, growing would have to come first. She was still too young. She would have to take this, one step at a time.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue skillfully placed \u201cOlivia\u201d under the care of the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d and proceeded to withdraw from the source world.</p><br/><p>It was time to do some research and make her plans. She even went to post on the internet and see what advice the netizens could give her \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>How could I settle at just being a game\u2019s princess?</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] Reference to a real web novel titled \u201cThe Paladin Zhao Daniu\u201d on the Qidian website.</p>\n</div>"}

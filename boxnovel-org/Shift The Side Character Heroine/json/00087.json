If the male character was originally a handsome man, simply just insist that was a beauty. As for the personalities, not much difference is needed between them.</p><br/><p>She might have shown her support towards her husband, but still, she requested to go through the contents beforehand. This was to avoid any awkward description of the female characters.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently I\u2019m in great condition while writing, especially during portraying this character \u2018Unpleasant Rain\u2019 aka \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019. It felt as if my writings are alive, as if she appears before me playing this game named \u2018Eternal War\u2019! I\u2019ll never make her someone flamboyant and unreal anymore. Because she really does exists! She is a very interesting girl. She has fallen in love with playing games due to her loneliness. She had even mastered different languages for that. Also, she loves to talk while playing games\u2026\u201d Ye Hai was full of excitement as he passed the draft to her.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ye Hai who seemed yet to return from the author\u2019s world, she couldn\u2019t help but start to believe a little. For Ye Hai frequently being in an \u201cinspiration outbursting\u201d state previously. Every time he went into that state, his typing speed and efficiency seemed to be boosted.</p><br/><p>There was even a boost in the quality of the words. The characters portrayed were brought to life by Ye Hai who already was good at portraying male characters and game scenes. The readers could feel as if they were actually there to experience the scenes!</p><br/><p>If the writings of Rosemary under normal circumstances was at High God[1] level, then under \u201cinspiration outbursting\u201d state, his writings would be at Supreme God[1] level. It could easily affect the emotions of the readers, causing them to submerge themselves into the world outlined by him!</p><br/><p>Ye Hai handed over the responsibility to publish the draft to his wife Li Mengyao and continued to throw himself into writing. He tried to write as much as possible when he was in this great condition.</p><br/><p>Li Mengyao surged with huge expectations. She actually finished all the drafts right away. Then, she told her husband who was busy typing on the keyboard, \u201cAnything more? Anything more? This is not enough! I want to see the part where Lin Feng and Tang Yongkai found out that \u2018Unpleasant Rain\u2019 was actually the great beauty who previously caught their eyes. I am really looking forward to their reactions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the reply she got was only Ye Hai\u2019s rhythmic typing sound. Seeing her husband working hard, a glimmer of tenderness appeared on her face. She started to look through the draft once more and prepare to correct her husband\u2019s misspellings.</p><br/><p>Surprised to her, there was not even a single misspelling within this 10,000 words draft!</p><br/><p>Incredible!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s truly a smooth and remarkable passage!</p><br/><p>Then, what pleased her more was that her husband\u2019s subsequent portrayal of this female character \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d. She originally thought that a character like Mary Sue who was flamboyant to the max was hopeless. It was impossible to regain the reader\u2019s love anymore. Surprisingly, after she finished reading the drafts, she found that this character was very interesting!</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was originally an extremely pale and empty character. She seemed perfect from the outside, but this was actually unreal. Readers who were slightly particular about reasonability would have declared open season on this particular plot. Especially about taking a limo to the cyber cafe. Besides, the subsequent forcible explanations could barely fool the readers. Yet, when the characteristics of Yu Shengfan were revealed, this game-loving and PK indulged \u201cInternet Addicted Lady\u201d seemed to be more acceptable. What a vivid character\u2026</p><br/><p>The Moe part of her was undoubtedly her non-stop talking mouth. Of course, when this appeared in game, it was merely some chat bubbles on top of her head which would never disappear. If someone who never stops talking and taunting exists in the reality, and appeared as a gaming opponent, surely this person would be hated to death. But in the books, \u201ctalkative\u201d and \u201cvenomous tongue\u201d would become Moe characteristics. Especially after the readers saw the subsequent storyline and discovered that this person has a high chance of becoming the main character\u2019s teammate.</p><br/><p>The readers supporting the main character Lin Feng would naturally have their good impression +20 towards his team formation. Besides, the character \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d did not look like a feeder teammate. How powerful would the \u201cGlory Squad\u201d become if she whose formidable techniques were yet to be revealed could join hands with Lin Feng?</p><br/><p>In a few words, the contents of the draft portraying \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d subsequently gave a boost in the expectations in this novel. Because the subsequent contents were truly fantastic. The readers even subconsciously forgot about the awkward description in the beginning and only remembered her as a rich lady, with the settings of her mastering languages from various countries. This was simply to allow her to criticize, taunt and create troubles freely against opponent gaming teams from other countries in future!</p><br/><p>Yu Shengfan was a total troublemaker, she would constantly create hatreds. This way, the story would be more interesting. Yu Shengfan could be in charge of drawing hatreds, while Lin Feng who cared little about wealth and had a calm and modest personality, would be in charge of the onslaught. Imagine the moments he teaches others a lesson, and sometimes reveals his skills to show off. Isn\u2019t that very cool?</p><br/><p>The chatterbox king and the strongest king. Teaming up both of them was just a perfect scene to be seen!</p><br/><p>Actually, the setting of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d as a lonely, friendless girl is a hint to the readers. She was willing to go any length to protect someone whom she regarded as her friend. If \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was to be a guy, it did not feel weird at all. Such \u201clone wolf\u201d characteristics would become a \u201cloyal dog\u201d to whoever that is capable of becoming the \u201clone wolf\u2019s\u201d best friend. This type of character was frequently seen in novels, and the readers just could not stop loving them.</p><br/><p>Clearly, Ye Hai had already applied the method of portraying male characters onto \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d. He did not treat \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d as a disposable side character, but as a core supporting character. He did not even notice that the settings of this character was actually not from him, but thought that it was a product of his outbursting inspiration. Anyway, he was very satisfied with this character. This is the first female character he created with such a sense, and he just loved her. He reckoned that he had finally portrayed a female character with a soul with success!</p><br/><p>No matter what the readers thought, he would continue this!</p><br/><p>Nobody could stop an author who has lost his senses!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Qidian author level is in such an ascending order: Middle God(), High God(), Ancient High God(), Supreme God().</p>\n</div>"}

She had spoken to \u201cher\u201d many times, \u201cshe\u201d was definitely a literary girl in Zhao Youyue\u2019s mind. They have even talked about skin care recently; there was no way that \u201cshe\u201d was a male author.</p><br/><p>If Leng Zi is indeed a male author, she would force him to cross-dress!</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhao Youyue would never guess that Leng Zi was her deskmate, Han Leng. After being deskmates with Zhao Youyue, Han Leng\u2019s good memory would serve him well, after taking some notes off the products she used and recommended.</p><br/><p>This is how one draws ideas and inspiration as well!</p><br/><p>Han Leng always believed himself to be well-versed in a rich lady\u2019s behavior. Despite Zhao Youyue not being a typical, rich lady stereotype, her low profile yet luxurious life, her intricate, detailed knowledge on particulars, had completely blown Han Leng\u2019s mind!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue seemed to be approachable, but she could never truly hide the sense of superiority that was deep within her!</p><br/><p>This was the reason why the Zhao family often left people disgruntled!</p><br/><p>But Han Leng was trying his best to adapt\u2026 He felt embarrassed to eat the snacks of Lady Zhao all the time; he did not take it for granted, like the little angel, Jiang Qing.</p><br/><p>After a while, he got used to running errands for Lady Zhao, like handing over her homework to the homeroom teacher, or stacking his answer sheet with hers, it brought him great honor.</p><br/><p>At times, he would snap out of it and think of \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d there was no way he would fall in love with this troublesome Lady Zhao, for he had already walked through the passage of adolescence!</p><br/><p>With \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d in his mind, Han Leng had restricted himself from falling in love with Lady Zhao again and again; he even nitpicked at her flaws, her waste of resources, her laziness, pickiness, hypocritical bias, and ego! Everyone has to follow her orders, but she still puts up a gentle face, like she really cared about them. Her heart was darker than black!</p><br/><p>Han Leng convinced himself that he has already seen through this flawed and capricious lady! She only pretends to be low-profile, but in fact, loved being under the spotlight!</p><br/><p>In conclusion, Goddess Chu was the best!</p><br/><p>Besides running errands for Lady Zhao, Han Leng sometimes would buy \u201ca commoner\u2019s snack\u201d with his own money from the canteen to give it to Zhao Youyue. Even though some snacks would not earn a second bite, some snacks made her happy, and she would take the extra bite.</p><br/><p>On one particular Sunday\u2019s afternoon, Lady Zhao decided to go shopping, and to show that he was a gentleman, Han Leng followed Zhao Youyue to the shopping mall.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was not just the two of them, Jiang Qing tagged along too. She was not happy with Han Leng at first, because he had taken her place, but after realizing that he was just as obedient to Zhao Youyue, she changed her opinion about him. She wanted to try ordering him about as well, but it backfired, Han Leng was not interested in a big-titted pleb, he couldn\u2019t figure out why Zhao Youyue became such close friends with Jiang Qing. He even started mocking Jiang Qing without any reason.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had Chu Luoxun, he became a total scumbag to other girls, sealing his fate to be forever alone\u2026</p><br/><p>He thought that Jiang Qing only relied on those in power! He would only obey the orders of Lady Zhao, because he was a gentleman and an information broker!</p><br/><p>He was not a slave of Lady Zhao\u2019s! He would never become a slave to the Zhao family!</p><br/><p>Long story short, in the process of gathering information, Han Leng had taken note of Zhao Youyue\u2019s list of hobbies.</p><br/><p>This was why Zhao Youyue had been getting along so well with Leng Zi; it was because she thought that they clicked!</p><br/><p>If Zhao Youyue finds out that Leng Zi is Han Leng, it would undoubtedly upset her!</p><br/><p>Han Leng, how dare you to lie to Lady Zhao?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s unforgivable!</p><br/><p>Are you trying to rebel!?</p><br/><p>Cross-dress, only a cross-dressing would quench her rage!</p><br/><p>In fact, many of the fans had the same thoughts as Zhao Youyue; they did not believe that Leng Zi was a male author. Even if he is a male author, it would not make any difference. But if he ever goes against his promise, then apologize, by cross-dressing!</p><br/><p>Some fans had already screenshotted his chat history, included the message of him revealing his true gender. If Leng Zi ever kills Chu Luoxun, he would have to post a photo of himself cross-dressing, there was no escape!</p><br/><p>Han Leng smirked, he knew that he would never kill his beloved Goddess Chu, he wanted her to live in his literary world. So he could always be reminded of her whenever he read back his own writings.</p><br/><p>And so, he agreed. If he is to kill Chu Luoxun, he would cross-dress!</p><br/><p>Of course, he was not a pervert, he just loved her, far beyond those dirty desires. Every woman in reality was nothing, compared to her! Every time he gets \u201cinspired,\u201d he would look down on the other women in reality\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, he sat down to write a new passage containing \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Han Leng was excited, as it was the summer holidays, he could now focus entirely on his novel! That\u2019s right, in order to conceal his \u201cLeng Zi\u201d identity, he had been unable to write at will in the classroom.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao only looked like a quiet person on the outside; once she gets familiar with someone, she would ask all sorts of question, out of curiosity. Just like the last time, when Zhao Youyue asked Han Leng for the title of his novel, baiting him to spill it with her money\u2026</p><br/><p>After becoming deskmates, Zhao Youyue and Han Leng became closer. Zhao Youyue was curious about the identity of the girl that Han Leng had a crush on, only remembering him saying that she was far more beautiful and better than her. Even though she felt a little bit offended, but back then she was still a nobody, so she had endured it.</p><br/><p>But after Zhao Youyue became famous in school and received a lot of love letters, she became cocky, thinking that no one could ever compete with her. Please understand that Zhao Youyue had transformed from a normal high school student, to a mini-celebrity. Of course, she adapted to all of this in a short amount of time, retaining her old saint-like personality on the outside.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue who was full of self-confidence, was still curious about the identity of that particular goddess.</p><br/><p>No doubt, Han Leng was not willing to tell at all, but Lady Zhao was not going to give up that easily. Finally, he tells Zhao Youyue that she had a marvelous skill at playing the violin, not even Lady Zhao could match up with her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue only smiled at him, while she was thinking, \u201cJust you wait till I get my hands on the character card, Chu Luoxun. I will definitely win!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since the two of them became deskmates, Han Leng could not write his novel in comfort; he had to stop Zhao Youyue from asking what he was writing, and he even had to serve Lady Zhao to appease her! Even though he would always be greeted by her sincere smile and encouraging praises, he couldn\u2019t help but think himself a slave to her!</p><br/><p>No, he was just gathering information and materials, he can\u2019t be a slave!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look down on him, just because he was a gentleman!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Han Leng wanted to write the plot regarding Chu Luoxun; his familiar \u201cinspiration\u201d has returned!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zhao Youyue was performing her last act in \u201cBeautiful April\u201d!</p>\n</div>"}

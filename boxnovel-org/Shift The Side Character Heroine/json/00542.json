They would always match themselves up against the girl, wondering if they would be able to provide her happiness and so on. They would also feel the need to improve themselves before they tried to chase the girl.</p><br/><p>This was not wrong. However, girls easily get swept off their feet by just about any guy who had the guts to take the first step, even if the man was a total, irresponsible slob.</p><br/><p>This was why the world was full of puzzled good men who often thought to themselves, why is she dating that douchebag? In the end, they would only be filled with resentment \u2014- \u2014- she has terrible taste!</p><br/><p>Surely enough, 2D girls are perfect. They are my real wives, only they truly understand me!</p><br/><p>Hence, only otakus could see through the flaws of 3D girls \u2014- \u2014- a lack of taste. Of course, in the end, most otakus would have to find a 3D girl and make do. It was their duty to get married and produce children eventually, ensuring that their bloodlines do not die off, right?</p><br/><p>True otakus had already resigned to spending their lives alone. They understood that their 2D girls were their real love. One day, when artificial intelligence develops sufficiently, and 2D girls are able to possess the bodies of androids, these otakus would find true happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Fei, what is this talk of chasing girls? That\u2019s really too superficial. I\u2019m happy to look at beautiful girls and appreciate their beauty from afar. If I really attempted to chase one, wouldn\u2019t I only cause trouble for myself?\u201d Liu Yue laughed off the sting with a smile, but bitterness filled his heart. There goes his chance again.</p><br/><p>Kong Fei smiled knowingly, not exposing Liu Yue\u2019s real thoughts. In the end, the girl was far too modest for her own good. She was so beautiful \u2013 the average boy would not even dare meet her eyes. Would this make it easier for guys who took the initiative?</p><br/><p>It was none of his business. He had a square face, but he was actually also an anime fanatic. He was not exactly an otaku, but it did not prevent him from taking 2D girls as his wife \u2013 3D girls were all scums!</p><br/><p>He felt that the most hurtful thing was some people saying \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve seen your wife\u2019s life story, and you\u2019re not the protagonist!</p><br/><p>He also hated it when people said that his wife was akin to a public bus, although this seemed to be the fact. The cuter she was, the more people shared her\u2026</p><br/><p>Liu Yue and Kong Fei were not the only boys who had their eyes on Zhao Youyue. Her incognito mode had shattered into pieces. Some of the more passionate boys were already thinking of making a move on her.</p><br/><p>So what if you\u2019re not a good match? When it comes to getting a girl, you only need be bold and have the hide of a rhino. So what if you did not have looks, talent, or wealth? You only needed a manly, sincere heart!!</p><br/><p>Wait, you don\u2019t even need that, you just have to pretend to have one!</p><br/><p>60 to 70 percent of girls would be obtained that way. Boys could then curse at the remaining 30 to 40 percent. Such materialistic, judgmental girls, to cast aside their sincerity so blindly!</p><br/><p>It was not easy being a pretty girl. No matter what a pretty girl did, she would be in the wrong. It was truly the root of all their troubles.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had failed to remain low-key. This undoubtedly spelled trouble to her, as university was not exactly like high school. In high school, couples had to keep their relationships under wraps. However, in universities, boys could openly take action in numerous ways.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see how Zhao Youyue handles this. Oh, woe is she to be cursed with such great charm. How troublesome indeed.</p><br/><p>It was as troublesome as how being rich was just as troublesome!</p><br/><p>Would a girl be happy to be so beautiful? To an extent! If not, why were the main female protagonists of transmigration novels so beautiful?</p><br/><p>Girls were far more complicated than the other sex. They would inevitably feel envy and jealousy. Zhao Youyue\u2019s female classmates were dumbfounded. At the end of the day, she was the most beautiful girl?</p><br/><p>Others wanted to see how He Weiwei would react to this. Her fame was being robbed from her. Would she feel angry? Would her heart be stifled? After all, no matter how you looked at it, He Weiwei could not be a decent person.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, these girls were disappointed. He Weiwei only made herself look good in order to attract similarly good-looking ones. The moment she entered the dormitory, Zhao Youyue had immediately caught her eye. That\u2019s exactly what she wanted, right? If anything, she hoped to nurture that beauty. Being friends with a peerless beauty would only increase her reputation.</p><br/><p>Some readers must be wondering. Zhao Youyue was not this beautiful in high school, right?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s talk about the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d and \u201ccharacter cards.\u201d The more Zhao Youyue uses the character cards, more of their powers would remain imprinted on her.</p><br/><p>Now, name me one less-than-decent looking character card.</p><br/><p>Naturally, other than their powers, the settings of these iconic female characters would slowly grow on Zhao Youyue, turning her from plain into something far more\u2026</p><br/><p>The changes happened very gradually, very subtly. It was so gradual that those around her would never notice. It was just like the natural growth of a person. Furthermore, her classmates had been engrossed in their studies. Now that Zhao Youyue was in university, anyone who laid their eyes upon her for the first time would receive the full blast of her beauty!</p><br/><p>And so, the military training began. Zhao Youyue\u2019s class was paired up with another Chinese Department-based course. They formed a company of about 60 people. These 60 people would be placed under the command of a single instructor.</p><br/><p>As the girls far outnumbered the men, instructor Ma did not go all drill sergeant on them. Instructor Ma was rather young. He could not be blamed for being affected by beautiful ladies.</p><br/><p>Of course, as a professional, he still had certain standards to live up to. He dealt with the thorny men unceremoniously, having them stand in ridiculous poses. Naturally, they served as a warning to others.</p><br/><p>September was not the hottest month of the year, but the sun was not the most merciful existence around. Furthermore, military training lasted for almost an entire day. This new routine would not let up until it was near its end. At that stage, rest times would be given more often, and various casual activities like \u201csinging songs\u201d would become more frequent.</p><br/><p>Nobody dared even dream about these coming days, not when they were just at the starting line. Training after drills came barreling at them endlessly. Each proper step had to be broken down into several smaller steps. The most agonizing position would have to be the one involving standing on one foot midstride, while having the other foot raised just as much as your platoon members\u2026</p><br/><p>As they marched, some oddities occurred, such as marching with your lead hand and foot on the same side, or being unable to tell right from left.</p><br/><p>This training finally demonstrated the definition of teamwork and collectivity to the group.</p></div>\n</div>"}

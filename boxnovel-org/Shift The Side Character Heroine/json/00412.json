Of course, it had to have a coat as dark as the night. She had a soft spot for black cats.</p><br/><p>She may not have earned much from this excursion, but she had definitely learned some things of note. Namely, the knowledge on how to raise cats. After all, she had seen the world through feline lenses. She knew the thought processes of cats more than anyone else.</p><br/><p>Most cats thought the same \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>This is bad. I\u2019ve gone deep into the enemy territory and have fallen prisoner to these humans. However, I will not give in to them. They will never break my poker face!</p><br/><p>Even if I am to be touched and caressed every day, I will not give in. I\u2019m a mighty, fluffy kitty! My worthless human only exists to serve my every need!</p><br/><p>How dare he! Today, my owner did not even pet me, because he was busy with work. There is no other way; I\u2019ll have to take the initiative. Of course, I certainly don\u2019t enjoy being petted by my owner!</p><br/><p>A majority of cats were \u2018tsun\u2019s. Tsun as in Tsundere. They did not readily show affection for their owner like dogs, but sometimes, they could not help but tease and play around with their owners. Such actions were akin to them rewarding their slaves\u2026</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue was the shopkeeper of a pet shop in the novel, she had gotten familiar with proper cat care. Of course, after that, she became very confident about raising a cat. This also meant that she could select one particular cat to become the target of her body swapping. Once she has set a target, it would be permanent. From the beginning until the end, the novel character \u201cMao Mao\u201d could only swap bodies with that particular mysterious cat.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue sets her mind on something, she would always put her back into it. In no time at all, she found herself an extremely cute, little black cat. It was adorably tiny, and was practically a living vacuum of \u2018awwws\u2019 and \u2018oooohs.\u2019</p><br/><p>After she masterfully handled all the necessary papers, Zhao Youyue took her little black cat home. She took the little black cat back to her room. Upon activating the \u201cHua Xiaomao\u201d card, she started swapping bodies to with a cat\u2026</p><br/><p>How would this ability play out in reality?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Zhao Youyue did not turn into a cat, but this did not mean that nothing had happened altogether. Her spirit had somehow intertwined with that of this innocent, little black cat!</p><br/><p>It was as if the little black cat had become an extension of her consciousness. She was practically inside the cat\u2019s head and could telepathically order the little black cat around\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is neow it works in reality?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow? What\u2019s with the meows when I talk neow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow meow meow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI may neowt have become a cat, but it has definitely affected me-ow. Is this heow this ability works neow?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue, no, Youyue Meow, meowtured to herself, something lit up in the blank eyes of the cat. A hidden door to new frontier of wisdom\u2026</p><br/><p>Strangely, Zhao Youyue felt the sudden yearning to be petted on the head. When she tried to walk, she could not help but crawl instead. When she talked, the word \u201cmeow\u201d was attached to every line. She was now Youyue Meow!</p><br/><p>Acting cute was certainly not one of Zhao Youyue\u2019s habits. She was a lady with style. How did she get into this Youyue Meow state, where she would feel like dying if she did not act cute for a single moment?</p><br/><p>Youyue Meow lay on the bed lazily, just like a cat. The little black cat, on the other hand, was using its tiny paws to knead Youyue Meow\u2019s big chest like a big lump of dough\u2026</p><br/><p>The expression on Youyue Meow\u2019s face was one of ecstasy. If netizens saw such a scene, they would scream out loud \u2014- \u2014- Get off that girl, let me do it!</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue activated this character card, which seemed to offer nothing except for the irrepressible desire to act cute. She felt as if her soul had been divided into two parts. One part dwelled within the little black cat, which gave it some human intellectual traits. On the other hand, she had reincarnated into Youyue Meow, the Youyue Meow that would die if she did not act cute!</p><br/><p>Of course, this was markedly different, compared to the ability to change into a cat in the novel. In the novel, the user had exchange bodies with the cat altogether. After the exchange, the user would be unaware of what her original body is going through.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it would be wise for the user to ensure that their own body was \u2018parked\u2019 at a safe place before using the ability to change into a cat. Otherwise, entertaining things were bound to happen.</p><br/><p>Of course, in the novel, the one who had experienced such embarrassing and funny things was the male protagonist. Zhao Youyue had possessed Hua Xiaomao, and she was not one to make such mistakes.</p><br/><p>Now that they were in reality, the powers that would be had placed a hand on the wheel and adjusted it to suit her world. Also, this real-world had long hosted a neverending argument on whether animals even possessed souls. Therefore, would an actual exchange of souls occur?</p><br/><p>Now, Zhao Youyue had turned into a super cat trainer. With one look, the cat would understand each of her thoughts, albeit at the price of becoming\u2026 Youyue Meow.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Hei[1], go outside and get me an apple meow.\u201d Youyue Meow instructed.</p><br/><p>Of course, the little black cat that Zhao Youyue had named as \u201cXiao Hei\u201d acted more like a human than a cat. She looked at Youyue Meow affectionately, as if she was the master, and Youyue Meow was her pet\u2026</p><br/><p>Rather than calling her Xiao Hei, she should be called the classy lady, Zhao Xiaohei![2] (When Xiao Hei is in the Zhao Xiaohei state, she is referred as \u201cshe\u201d or \u201cher\u201d rather than \u201cit,\u201d because she\u2019s the human of that moment. On the contrary, Youyue Meow would be referred to as \u201cit.\u201d LOL)[3]</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue\u2019s mother, Wang Hua, returned home, she saw a super cute little black cat trying its best to get an apple to Zhao Youyue. She was rolling the apple on the floor\u2026</p><br/><p>It could not be helped. With a tiny body like that, she could only roll it like that. The house was always immaculate. When Youyue Meow receives the apple, she would still be able to eat it, provided she washes it.</p><br/><p>Wang Hua was shocked!</p><br/><p>Since when did such a cute little black cat appear at home? She was even rolling an apple with a purpose!</p><br/><p>This was definitely the doing of her daughter, that Little Sloth, Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>In actuality, Wang Hua did not like pets. Otherwise, it would be no surprise for such an upstanding family to keep pets at home. However, she had been born with a dislike towards them. Perhaps she had a traumatic experience with animals as a child, which left her scarred for life. Moreover, keeping pets was a hassle\u2026</p><br/><p>However, after the cat spotted her, Wang Hua suddenly found this cat to be particularly affectionate. It took the initiative to call out with a \u201cmeow-meow.\u201d It seemed to be calling her \u201cmama.\u201d At that moment, Wang Hua had to admit that her lifelong scars had been healed. Her motherly instincts went on overdrive.</p><br/><p>As the Little Sloth Zhao Youyue grew, she was no longer cute as she was a child. Not being able to play with her daughter like before left Wang Hua frustrated.</p><br/><p>However, meeting this little black cat seemed to have transported her into an illusory realm. She seemed to be staring straight at Zhao Youyue as a child!</p><br/><p>She really felt like touching it\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cXiao Hei\u201d literally means \u201clittle black.\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] Since one part of Zhao Youyue\u2019s soul is with Xiao Hei, it becomes somewhat humanly. The author here is trying to say that since Xiao Hei is partly possessed by Zhao Youyue, Xiao Hei becomes part of her. Thus it is like a lady with style (Zhao Youyue). Therefore, it becomes Zhao Xiaohei.</p><br/><p>[3] The words in the bracket are notes by the original author.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

China has always been a country which prioritizes education since ancient times, well, the elite scholars had always caught the eyes of everyone. If she had become one of them, could she still live on without a mere sense of presence?</p><br/><p>By coincidence, the school she had entered was very particular about the examination results, not to mention, she pretty much hated the times she faced tough questions in exercises or exams but failed to answer them. Hence, she made up her mind to become the top student who is passionate for studies in the world of \u201cPure Romance\u201d.</p><br/><p>Due to her lack of perseverance in reality, she could easily lose her momentum in studies. However, things were different when she was in \u201cXu Jing\u2019s\u201d form, as she would feel anxious from head to toe whenever she stopped studying.</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Jing\u201d was not a popular character, let alone an iconic one, and thus, Zhao Youyue was not allowed to inherit her ability of \u201cIndulge in Studies\u201d. Anyway, the knowledge she had obtained in the process of playing the character \u201cXu Jing\u201d, actually remained in her mind. As such, she willingly became a mere side character in \u201cPure Romance\u201d and did not mess around.</p><br/><p>Ugh, Zhao Youyue was now facing a little trouble, which was none other than the 3,000-words remorse letter. Could this remorse letter be a problem if she happened to be a top student? Wait, in the first place, does it even matter for top students to play their mobile phones in class?</p><br/><p>The current situation of her school was pretty much like this. The teachers were exceptionally generous to the top students. Should you score well in exams, you could wander around without qualms, as long as you do not disturb the studies of others.</p><br/><p>This was a reason that Zhao Youyue could not wait to become a top student, as that would grant her exceptional privileges. At the same time, her parents would be so happy and proud, and probably increased the limit of her allowance.</p><br/><p>This is the status of becoming top students in China. Well, they possess overwhelming sense of presence. The countrymen have always assumed that all children of others were having good results. Hmm, it seems that anyone with good results will be treated as a reputable person, no matter how ugly and nasty they are, still, they will earn people\u2019s respect\u2026</p><br/><p>It was late in the evening. The second-last lesson was about to end, and the last lesson was presumably the most popular class ever, the activity class. The guys would play basketball and football to shake off their sweats; while the girls could also play basketball if they wanted to, otherwise, they could take a stroll and chitchat with their friends in the school compound, or quietly read books in the library. Some students would even sneak back to the dorms for mobile games. It is now obvious why the activity class is very much welcomed by the students.</p><br/><p>Of course, the earnest students would continue to study in the classroom, solely to attain better score in exams, and in hope of being admitted to their dream college three years later.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue planned to take this opportunity of the activity class to seek help from her old classmate in junior high, Han Leng, and to see whether he was willing to offer his \u2018Love Letter Ghostwriting\u201d service at a reasonable price.</p><br/><p>As his name had spoken, Han Leng [1] appeared to be a cold person, who emits an unwelcoming aura. He always carried a sullen face, with his eyebrows frowning, as if he was pondering over an abstruse philosophy. Besides, he had thick eyebrows and his seemingly handsome face was filled with \u201cdivine aura\u201d. Perhaps he had always stayed up late, and so his face was full of pimples. Well, if it was not for that, he will probably look even better.</p><br/><p>Almost every time when the class was over, he would be leaning over the table alone to catch up on his sleep. Only a few minutes after the school bell rang, he would wake up slowly.</p><br/><p>By right, a poker-faced cold man like Han Leng, should have no friends and was ostracized by the others. But, he was considered quite a sociable guy. Not to mention, there were girls who had crushes on him during junior high, perhaps this is the glamour of a talented man. Anyway, his chilly appearance seemed pretty cool.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was now looking at his digital watch, and yawned in an unscrupulous manner. He couldn\u2019t wait for the activity class \u2014 I should be able to sleep happily, if anyone dares to disturb me\u2026 Nah, this is unlikely, as those who are close to me, shall know that I hate people disturbing my slumber time, whereas those who are not, dare not take a step closer upon seeing my stinky face.</p><br/><p>He was of such confidence, that he felt as if he was an omniscience!</p><br/><p>Some people might find him lonely, but indeed, he did not mind to be left alone. To Han Leng himself, that feels better than loving a girl.</p><br/><p>The school bell finally rang. Seizing every minute and every second, he immediately bent over his table, as if he was dashing to his warm bed. Closing his eyes, his tightened face had finally loosened. Ah! That feeling was truly awesome!</p><br/><p>Anyway, he reckoned that it would be even more exciting to sleep stealthily whilst the teacher was giving lectures. The lecturing voices, are simply perfect for lullabies, but still, he was not that audacious. By the way, things will not be exciting if there is no restriction at all. The wife, is no match for the concubine; the concubine, is no match for someone\u2019s wife; and someone\u2019s wife, is no match for an unattainable woman. He felt that the floundering of to sleep or not during the class, is akin to the moment of confessing to a one\u2019s first crush, as he will feel cherished but anxious at the same time about her answer. Is it a \u2018Yes\u2019 or a \u2018No\u2019?</p><br/><p>After the class ended, Zhao Youyue withdrew her own thermos flask and sipped slowly. Her gestures were so ladylike, and it kind of displayed that she was a well-educated person. Suddenly, she turned her head slightly, and observed Han Leng with her split version. On catching sight of Han Leng sleeping on the table, she stealthily gave a sigh of relief. If he went out to play basketball with the other guys, she would have a tough time approaching him. After all, this seemed like a crooked deal, perhaps people would even mistaken their relationship. Well, I guess all of us do know that rumors spread like a wildfire in schools.</p><br/><p>If he was in class, things will be easier, as there were only a handful of students staying in class for revision.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about joining me in badminton, Little Yue?\u201d her deskmate Zhou Fang invited her with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe next time, you know, I haven\u2019t written that remorse letter. Mr. Qiu will probably collect it tomorrow, I\u2019ve to speed up\u2026\u201d Zhao Youyue declined.</p><br/><p>Zhou Fang gave an expression of sympathy, upon thinking of Zhao Youyue\u2019s misfortune. Anyway, she was absolutely impressed by Zhao Youyue. This girl had actually bought a new phone! Whenever the class was over and the teacher was absent, again, she would be playing with her phone. Sure enough, she was severely addicted to her phone, but she was too bold to be true, eh? Was she not afraid that her phone will be confiscated again?</p><br/><p>Students who remained in class were leaving one after another, the classroom was gradually becoming more spacious. The sunset\u2019s light was pouring into the classroom, and shining onto the blackboard, like it had sputtered a charming halo, in which the dust could be seen floating. Such a scene is as beautiful as the ones in a picture!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue slowly walked up to Han Leng, and then patted his shoulder. Apparently, he had not fallen asleep, and looked up to her. His poker face, seemed to be infused with anger. It is not because he was just about to sleep, but he had been so confident that nobody would dare to disturb him. To him, this is absolutely an embarrassing accident. So, he got steamed up.</p><br/><p>Looking at Zhao Youyue\u2019s fair and lovely face, not to mention her innocent eyes which had shown her guiltiness for disturbing others, however, Han Leng was not moved even a slight bit but responded apathetically, \u201cHey you, which class are you from? Did you enter the wrong class?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was in the same class with you during junior high, my name is Zhao Youyue!\u201d Zhao Youyue identified herself hastily.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Youyue? Non-existent. I\u2019ve never heard of this person, you must have looked for the wrong person.\u201d Han Leng seemed to recall something, and then responded in a serious manner.</p><br/><p>That is why Zhao Youyue was very dissatisfied with her side-character nature!</p><br/><p>She had been classmates with Han Leng for three years during junior high, to think that this brat would say that he had never heard of her!</p><br/><p>Grrr, this is exasperating!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] In the name \u201cHan Leng\u201d \u2013 \u201c\u201d , Han is the last name while Leng is the first name. Leng () means cold.</p>\n</div>"}

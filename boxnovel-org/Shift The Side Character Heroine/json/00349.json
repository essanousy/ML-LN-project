Even he dared not provoke a little princess from the Zhao family! After all, Zhao Youyue was Zhao Hao\u2019s close relative.</p><br/><p>What that fuelled his endless curiosity was Zhao Hao suddenly saying that he had a multi-talented little cousin, as if she had just sprouted out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>Anyways, Zhao Youyue\u2019s charm was not enough to drive Ding Yuncong; he still loved his current lifestyle.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue always viewed herself as another ordinary rich lady. She was not fully aware of her father\u2019s influential power. How much power could the President of a Hospital wield?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not interested in gauging the range of her ruling arm. Ever since she procured the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d she had spent most of her efforts on experiencing many different lives, admiring different sceneries, and acquiring more skills. She had grown utterly addicted to that surreal realm.</p><br/><p>Most interestingly, as she transformed herself, as she slowly claimed the main character\u2019s spot, her family background had been heading towards the same direction as well. Zhao Youyue had only remained unaware of it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao enjoyed his meal with the company of his girlfriend. The dishes were pretty decent. Unfortunately, Zhao Youyue was not a food critic from a manga; she could not judge the food quality with a single bite. Food mangas were so ludicrous, that even a side character could become a food critic.</p><br/><p>As a minor and a lady, Zhao Youyue did not have to drink any alcohol, but exchanging toast was a must, so she took some soft drinks in place of it. She took the initiative to toast with every guest, not because she wanted to get along with them, but to increase Zhao Hao\u2019s prestige. Zhao Hao had spent so much money for her, it would not hurt for her to return the favor, by showing her sincerity.</p><br/><p>When it was Ding Yuncong\u2019s turn to get toasted by Zhao Youyue, he was amazed at how well-mannered Zhao Youyue was. Her social etiquette was flawless, Zhao Hao certainly had an excellent little cousin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao had gone through all the trouble to invite everyone here because he wanted to show off of his little cousin. That was his real purpose!</p><br/><p>There was a piano in the restaurant. Unsurprisingly, Zhao Hao suggested that Zhao Youyue play a song when everyone almost finished with their meals.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue agreed without hesitation; she even asked the guests to pick whichever song they like. Somehow, everyone felt like it would only degrade Zhao Youyue if they request for common songs and anyone could tell that she was really good at playing the piano as her poise and confidence was basically flooding the room.</p><br/><p>Everyone was in awkward silence, because not many guests knew much about the piano. Shi Jingnian who had remained silent throughout the feast finally spoke up, \u201cHow about \u2018Feux Follets[1]\u2019 by Franz Liszt, this would not be a challenge for you, yes, milady?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Shiya became agitated when Shi Jingnian requested that particular song, she knew that the song \u201cFeux Follets,\u201d was extremely hard. Not many pianists would dare to perform this song because it required an extreme level of skill; only a handful of people even knew of this song.</p><br/><p>Lin Shiya knew Shi Jingnian was making things difficult for Zhao Youyue, even though Zhao Youyue was famous for her amazing musical talent on the internet, she had never actually won any prizes for it. Besides, she only achieved something with the violin, so her piano skills level could not be as good as her violin.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian pretended to ignore the visibly agitated Lin Shiya; then he proceeded to explain that \u201cFeux Follets\u201d was an extremely hard song to play, as if he was warning Zhao Youyue not to be so full of herself\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao\u2019s expression became sour, he turned and whispered to Zhang Wanjun, \u201cWanjun, why did you bring this man along? He\u2019s ruining this on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Wanjun did not snap back at him for once. \u201cI only brought Lin Shiya with me, maybe he was worried about Shiya,\u201d Zhang Wanjun said awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao was furious, \u201cDo we look like we lack the company of women? Besides, with Youyue Meimei right here, who would bother about your friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zhao Hao decided to voiced up for Zhao Youyue, he saw Zhao Youyue flashing a dazzling smile, and her aura seemed to have changed. Her confidence seemed to be spreading out of her, \u201cI would gladly challenge that song.\u201d She said happily.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Zhao Youyue had activated the \u201cChu Luoxun card,\u201d \u201cFeux Follets\u201d was nothing to Chu Luoxun, who had the maximum music stats. She made some minor adjustments to the piano and started playing.</p><br/><p>Even though \u201cFeux Follets\u201d was a tough song, but without a doubt, it was a song suitable for showing off one\u2019s piano skills, and it perfectly flaunted the pianist\u2019s capability for speed\u2026</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue played, her mysterious \u201cspiritual music\u201d took hold of the mortals once again. The music she played took the shape of a beautiful will-o-wisp that floated around the restaurant. However, unlike its name suggested, it did not give anyone the chills, but wandered about with joy and lightness.</p><br/><p>Everyone was struck dumb, because it was their first time experiencing such a mysteriously charming song.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong was one of them. His hobbies were common and simple. He enjoyed playing games, watching live streams, and even visiting nightclubs, but going to a restaurant while listening to classical music was not one of them, unless he had a function to attend to.</p><br/><p>But now, he was really amazed by the musical talents of Zhao Youyue. With the help of \u201cspiritual music,\u201d he could tell that the piano skills of Zhao Youyue were extraordinary, even though he knew nothing of classical music.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong was impressed. This Zhao princess certainly deserved his full respect. How long have she been practicing to attain such incredible piano techniques?</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Zhao Hao and Zhang Wanjun were extremely proud, as Zhao Youyue was their little cousin!</p><br/><p>Even the waiter had stopped delivering the dishes midway; he was staring at Zhao Youyue who continued working her magic.</p><br/><p>At this moment, she was the center of the universe.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>[1] Feux follets \u2013 a.k.a.

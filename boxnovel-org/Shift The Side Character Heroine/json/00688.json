That would be Olivia\u2019s sister, Cirilla.</p><br/><p>Cirilla and Triss got along rather well. Triss was like a big sister that Cirilla never had. However, she did not really approve of Triss liking Geralt. She did not think that it was worth Triss\u2019 while.</p><br/><p>Cirilla knew that Geralt truly loved Olivia and herself. He was way better than her biological father. Even so, she still remained proud and unyielding before him. She would never be like Olivia, who would take the extra step and act like a living doll to twist knots in the hearts of older men. Sometimes, Olivia would even mischievously go up to Geralt and mock his cringey acts in the process of picking up various sorceresses.</p><br/><p>In Cirilla\u2019s opinion, a man should only love one woman. Look at how she and her sister had remained so loyal to each other. How could this good-for-nothing Geralt just casually plow all these sorceresses?</p><br/><p>Cirilla rarely opposed her sister\u2019s various conniving acts, but this was one of the exceptions. Olivia was clearly very keen on introducing more sorceresses to Geralt. She intended to expand Geralt\u2019s social circle and get him accustomed to facing sorceresses. To put it plainly, she was just making Geralt a pimp!</p><br/><p>Geralt\u2019s physique attracted sorceresses, but it was basically a secret that was only limited to those close to him. Eskel, one of Geralt\u2019s childhood friends and a fellow witcher often poked fun at him for that. Eskel neither treated any kings like they were his brothers nor did he go to bed with sorceresses\u2026</p><br/><p>It was true. Geralt often treated individuals of note like his brothers and went to bed with various sorceresses. After all, blood energy gave sorceresses a great measure of beauty.</p><br/><p>Now that Geralt had got himself an excellent daughter like Olivia \u2013 one who was great at causing trouble, he had certainly grown more popular among the nobles. Olivia had molded him into the perfect male PR[1] officer. Sorceresses from all around the world had converged to Kaer Morhen.</p><br/><p>Only the group of elite, arrogant sorceresses from the Sorceress Academy of Aretuza on Thanedd Island remained free of the trap. Others who were not professionally trained were not famous enough to be accepted by royal courts. Almost all sorceresses who fell within this category have found themselves in Kaer Morhen where Olivia juiced them to the fullest.</p><br/><p>These sorceresses did not really have natural talent and were not strong enough. However, they certainly had some blood energy. It was enough for Olivia. If they spent some time and effort on figuring out how to improve the quality of life for the people, that would be enough.</p><br/><p>Mediocrity and fierce competition had given them adequate training when it came to enduring hardships. The Northern areas rarely welcomed regular sorceresses. Some kingdoms were even outrightly hostile to these sorceresses whose powers they did not completely understand. Moreover, there was also the Church of the \u201cEternal Fire\u201d that hunted sorceresses down and burned them alive. Even so, some stubborn sorceresses still intended to take advantage of the Free City of Novigrad\u2019s prosperity\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, there was a better choice. The Miracle City of Kaer Morhen. Why would they not come here? This place relied on magic to improve the lives of the ordinary people and to increase productivity. It was simply a heaven on earth for sorceresses. Moreover, its have been educated and would not easily be brainwashed by the Church like the other fools. They understood more than anyone that magic was \u2018the\u2019 productive force of this world. It was not inherently evil. Instead, it could help to bring happiness and comfort into everyone\u2019s lives.</p><br/><p>A high-leveled sorceress with superior talent might easily be able to get a position in the royal court in certain kingdoms. However, Kaer Morhen was the best choice for any other sorceress out there. They would be free from persecution and be able to contribute to society with a peace of mind. Living there was just like living in any other prosperous city. There was also that handsome guy out there, White Wolf Geralt\u2026</p><br/><p>Therefore, people who really understood Olivia would know that despite how she treated Geralt with a lot of respect on the surface, while having the word \u201cdaddy\u201d rolling off her tongue and acting cutesy, in actuality, Geralt was just a star male sorceress magnet!</p><br/><p>As more and more sorceresses were drawn to his abs, Kaer Morhen\u2019s magic technological strength shot up like a rocket. Kaer Morhen became the sole producer of several patented products!</p><br/><p>Perhaps Olivia saw it best to use the legendary witcher Geralt as Kaer Morhen\u2019s face, instead of using him to take out monsters. The longer he lingered, the more sorceresses would flood in.</p><br/><p>Yennefer\u2019s arrival had proven Olivia\u2019s theory. She wanted the \u201csorceress pile driver\u201d Geralt to be able to harness all the blood energy that the sorceresses in this world could offer!</p><br/><p>Of course, in addition to the sorceresses, sorcerers wandered about too, like Olivia\u2019s previous teacher \u2013 Vilgefortz who was a pretty powerful source sorcerer. However, compared to the number of sorceresses, sorcerers were so scarce that it was kind of pitiful.</p><br/><p>Olivia preferred to rinse her eyes off these pretty sorceresses.</p><br/><p>After Geralt and Yennefer were done being lovey-dovey, Olivia finally stepped into the light, accompanied by a group of Geralt\u2019s friends and family. She had a perfect smile on her face and greeted Yennefer rather politely. From Yennefer\u2019s \u201ccharacter information bar,\u201d she had a near-complete understanding of her legendary experiences, as well as her strong feelings for Geralt.</p><br/><p>Olivia was not only proficient in the \u201crecognizing someone as her father\u201d skill. \u201cRecognizing someone as her mother\u201d was almost as easy for her. She may not yet be addressing Yennefer as her mother, but her every move spoke otherwise\u2026</p><br/><p>No matter how cold Yennefer was, there was no way she could refuse the goodwill of a girl like Olivia, who had top-notch looks. However, she sensed Olivia\u2019s goodwill was merely out of courtesy. Perhaps, all elites had this ability. They could all pull off the perfect visage on the surface.</p><br/><p>While Olivia had put up a flawless facade, Yennefer was more interested in Cirilla, the girl who was not even bothered concealing her hostility. Was she the type who preferred someone simpler and bolder like Cirilla?</p><br/><p>All in all, as Olivia\u2019s little curtain play here had ensured this welcoming party\u2019s success\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] PR here stands for Public Relations.

She was analyzing if she could make use of this novel to create an iconic female character worthy of her time and effort. What other abilities could she inherit from this world?</p><br/><p>Every time she entered the Two Dimensional Gate, it was certainly a precious opportunity. Now that she entered this world of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d without a female character, she would not be able quit that easily. Unless she could possess a female character to stir up trouble and cause the novel to end miserably, she would not be allowed to bow out of the novel. Without taking further action, she could only wait the author to end the novel in real life. She did not have such patience!</p><br/><p>At first, she wanted to gain the abilities like dancing or singing, writing or drawing through the Two Dimensional Gate. She could even settle down with cooking, these abilities would surely allow her to make money in real life. To be able to achieve financial independence from her parents would surely make them proud and increase her sense of presence. She could even show off these abilities in school. She was in favor of this idea to obtain visibility via her own talents, after all she was not doing something bad.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had certainly not expected that she would enter the world of an Esports novel. In recent years, gaming is considered as a talent. Many streamers who perform live-broadcast gaming are earning more than millions yearly. Among her classmates, there were surely some who ganged up in games, but she felt embarrassed to join them as she was terrible at gaming.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue terrible gaming skill level was one of a kind too, but she would not want to get famous through a terrible gaming. If possible, she wished to a pro gamer who carries the team towards victory.</p><br/><p>Now that she had entered the world of gaming \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, she could naturally create an expert female gamer in accordance with the novel theme. It could not be some superstars or writers who won the favors of readers, rights? That is going off tangent. Come on, they are here to watch the heroes and side characters playing games.</p><br/><p>Who would want to read a doujinshi of \u201cNaruto\u201d or \u201cOne Piece\u201d without shinobies or pirates and sailors?</p><br/><p>After some analysis, Zhao Youyue reckoned that \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was certainly worthy of her time and effort. Put aside any other character settings for now. Zhao Youyue\u2019s priority was to mold an expert female gamer. She would use its character card in reality so that she could become an expert gamer too. That was quite a talent, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Wait, it would be best if this expert gamer was also good at scolding others. People would call her a\u2026 \u201cBraggart King\u201d. Due to Zhao Youyue\u2019s decent personality and background, she definitely did not know how to mock others, not to mention letting out some vulgar words. She had known after whom she should model her iconic character \u2014 Unpleasant Rain. Feel the wrath of my sword!</p><br/><p>Oh yeah, she would be a female Huang Shaotian[2]. How interesting!</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Youyue could activate the ability of Xu Jing to learn gaming. Still, she felt it was quite a waste as her parents despised gaming, yet she had zero talent in gaming. Perhaps she could only increase her LoL rank from \u201cbronze\u201d to \u201csilver\u201d in one year, and she would not be treated as a \u201csmall student\u201d anymore, but what was the meaning of that? Silver rank was nothing better, at least she must be a diamond-rank player before she could broadcast her gaming live.</p><br/><p>Enthuthiasm and hardworking are indeed powerful talents, but one must exercise them in the right direction to maximize their potential, otherwise it would be just a waste of time and effort.</p><br/><p>Even with the ability of Xu Jing, Zhao Youyue could never be the best student because of her average talent on learning, but it was already enough for her to be one of the top students.</p><br/><p>Her fellow student, Huang Zongchao was the very best student in school, he would always excel in midterms or final exams, he participated in mathematics and physics exams, even Chen Haoran were impressed by this amazing feats.</p><br/><p>Not only that his mathematics and physics were great, so do his language subjects, especially English. He could always scored more than 110 points out of 120 even with increased difficulty in high school, a freak indeed.</p><br/><p>Even though there were a lot of remarkable students in this semester, Huang Zongchao was still one of a kind. Everyone in high school would know his name. There were indeed a lot of geniuses, Zhao Youyue could not keep up with them, not even with the help of a golden finger.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not in pursuance of a perfect result. She wanted nothing more than the identity of an elite scholar, as that could increase her sense of presence and bring happiness upon her parents, she might then obtain some privileges. The result of semester finals had been sent to their home. Her father, Zhao Jiayi rejoiced when knowing that she was ranked 7th in class, he then gave her 50,000 RMB as a reward without hesitation. After all, that high school was one of the famous schools around the area, certainly it would make her father proud. Even her mother, Wang Hua who usually teased her was praising her as well. She might not be giving Zhao Youyue a reference book as her birthday present next time.</p><br/><p>These were the obvious benefits of getting a good result for Zhao Youyue. She did not study to gain more knowledge to become a scientist or what, but solely for the sake of her freedom. She just wanted a carefree life with lots of attention.</p><br/><p>Besides improving her result by utilizing Xu Jing character card, Zhao Youyue had decided to pick up a musical instrument again. She remembered her teacher once said that she was blessed with musical talent, but lack of perseverance. Now with the help of Xu Jing, she felt that she could actually exert her music talent to its full potential\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Streamers: Those guys (and girls) who stream their gameplay live, either by hobby or profession or make a living out of it.</p><br/><p>[2] Huang Shaotian() \u2013 a braggart character as well as a skilled gamer in the novel \u201cThe King\u2019s Avatar\u201d.</p>\n</div>"}

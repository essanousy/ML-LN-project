It was probably because her very soul had assimilated the memories from another world, inspiring a precocious girl like her to be even more matured now. To Youyue, communicating with same-age people was just as getting along with children, whilst a conversation with someone in the society like Su Li was way more meaningful.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had always remained calm and collected in the face of everything. Failing to get in touch with Rosemary depressed her for but a short while. Without dwelling further on it, she decided to let nature took its course. Never had she thought that Su Li would offer help to request a cameo character for her. That was a little surprise, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Anyhow, she did not really matter if Su Li could help her to obtain a cameo now. She had come to realization \u2014 instead of immersing oneself in meaningless anxiety which is a waste of time, why not spending the time to learn more things in this world? As such, without the character card, she could also rely on her will of learning to master more knowledge and skills.</p><br/><p>People should learn to be content. To Zhao Youyue, it was already an everlasting fortune to acquire the iconic character card of Xu Jing. She would not allow herself to lose her peace of mind and thirst for more character cards. At worst, just wait until the end of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d and then shift into another literary world. She could do that, couldn\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>Previously, Zhao Youyue was on pins and needles. She believed that opportunity knocks only once, and she would be sorry for herself if she did not accomplish something. Looking back, she felt that she had been drunk and lost her mind.</p><br/><p>After deliberating over everything, and assuming she had no \u201cDimensional Gate\u201d, she continued to indulge in her violin practice while utilizing Xu Jing iconic character card. Perhaps she had put on a ponytail like \u201cXu Jing\u201d, thus her actions were even more in sync with \u201cXu Jing\u201d now. In any case, her learning efficiency had increased, and she could be more focus in studying, not to mention that she could easily remain peaceful while activating \u201cXu Jing\u2019s possession\u201d mode.</p><br/><p>Tomorrow was their day of returning to hometown, the \u201cMahjong Town\u201d. It was also the time in which the three of them could enjoy a family dinner.</p><br/><p>On regular days, Zhao Youyue\u2019s father was always caught in dinner engagement thus he rarely ate at home, meanwhile her mother was used to take her dinner in university. Hence, Zhao Youyue would often take care of her own dinner too, after all she had abundant pocket money. Almost all the famous cafes, Chinese restaurants and Western restaurants in town had been visited by her. She absolutely deserved the title of chowhound! Some restaurants had fallen into her blacklist, while some had become her favorites. She even got to know the bosses and had her own VIP seats, as she was a true VIP.</p><br/><p>That being said, Zhao Youyue had been buying and cooking her own dishes through the power of Xu Jing iconic character card. Very much surprised, Xu Jing\u2019s culinary skills were spectacular, and her dishes miraculously had a sweet taste of home\u2026</p><br/><p>Sometimes she liked to contemplate shifting into gourmet works like \u201cCh\u016bka Ichiban!\u201d, \u201cFood Wars: Shokugeki no Soma\u201d, and \u201cThe Supplier of Culinary Delicacy\u201d. As such, would she acquire even greater culinary skills? But then, things gonna be peculiar, as she would be preparing some extravagant cuisine which looked colorful and shiny, yet was able to cause the tasters to be so addicted, as if they were aroused, beaten until their shirts being torn, or taking drugs. Hmm, was it even possible for such effects to take place in reality? If so, that would be amusing and make her stand out from everyone.</p><br/><p>Compared herself to Xu Jing, Zhao Youyue acknowledged that she could not hold a candle to her. Not only Xu Jing was diligent and passionate, she was a filial daughter too, unlike Youyue who had never thought of cooking a meal for parents. With her family background, she needed not express her love by this way. Anyway, she could feel that her parents still loved her more than she loved them. She was pampered by them and used to their mollycoddle since her childhood. Because she was the one and only daughter! Rarely would she have the notion to repay her parents\u2019 love, as she thought that her parents were already living a happy and blissful life, and so they could not be anymore happier regardless of what she did.</p><br/><p>After undergoing Xu Jing\u2019s life however, she started to introspect her past behaviours. Perhaps she should try doing something for them to the best of her abilities.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Zhao Youyue volunteered to prepare a home-cooked dinner for her parents tonight.</p><br/><p>At that time, Zhao Jiayi was about to call for food delivery. For sure, the food ordered by Mr. Zhao, the hospital director was not those random fast food purchased via \u201cMeituan.com\u201d or \u201cEle.me\u201d[1]. Instead, he would directly call the owner of some legacy private dining restaurant, demanding some dishes that were specially cooked by the chef to be delivered to their house. A private dining restaurant generally does not provide food delivery service. But the mighty hospital director could make it happened solely by one of his phone calls.</p><br/><p>Professor Wang definitely had no objection. She could not cook, even she could, she would be lazy. \u201cWhat? I\u2019ve to do dishwashing after the meal? That\u2019s troublesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>This family was one of a kind indeed. None of them was able to cook, but they have been living well for so many years, without feeling anything wrong.</p><br/><p>How great it is to be rich!</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Zhao Youyue offered to cook for her parents, Zhao Jiayi and Wang Hua were so astonished!</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi put down his phone right away. An incredulous look had shown on the face of this handsome middle-aged man, who then chuckled, \u201cAre you kidding Youyue? Do you cook?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hua also put down the redology literature about \u201cDream of the Red Chamber\u201d in her hand. She sniggered and teased her like always, \u201cOh our little sloth, if you can cook, I\u2019ll eat this book!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being arrogant since her childhood, Wang Hua was a beautiful and versatile elite scholar. She had barely done any housework in her life, would she believe her own daughter could make dishes? If she had no culinary skills, could her daughter possibly have them?</p><br/><p>This little sloth, is she trying to show off?</p><br/><p>How could she possess the skill that is not even found in her most perfect mother in the world?</p><br/><p>Impossible!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was expressionless. Not sure whether when she started holding a music sheet. She responded coldly while memorizing the music sheet, \u201cBut I\u2019ve bought the ingredients.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi was stealthily laughing at the side. He pretty much enjoyed seeing the daily bickering of this pair of mother and daughter. Prior to this, Zhao Youyue was always defeated by Wang Hua but this time, he perceived a different Zhao Youyue. The situation was almost a battle between two elite scholars. Was it a mere illusion?</p><br/><p>To her disbelief, Wang Hua rose to her feet and walked towards the kitchen, just to discover that her daughter Zhao Youyue had prepared the ingredients. As for the vegetables, there were already capsicums, brinjals, carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, etc. All sort of hearty food materials!</p><br/><p>Not to mention that the rice was already being cooked in the rice cooker\u2026</p><br/><p>What kind of situation is this?</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Meituan.com () and Ele.me () are two Chinese websites that provide food order and delivery online services.</p>\n</div>"}

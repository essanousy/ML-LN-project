Unfortunately, Leng Zi did not have a Weibo. Otherwise, Zhao Youyue would make her share it also.</p><br/><p>Su Li knew that her move was correct this time. It had won over Lady Zhao\u2019s heart. Meanwhile, the number of her followers have also increased!</p><br/><p>Now, her stigmatized nickname as a \u201ccheater\u201d was slowly being forgotten by many of her fans. It looked like she had completely straightened out</p><br/><p>This was the real Su Li!</p><br/><p>She never thought of deceiving the readers, yet, her mind was always thinking the ways to please them, especially the tycoon readers. This was why she had been so enthusiastic about getting close to Lady Zhao!</p><br/><p>She would always pay attention to the works that Zhao Youyue liked, and would check them out herself. If it fulfills her appetite, she had to do something to portray the similarity between her and Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>When it comes to cheating on the readers, circumstances had taken the power of out of her hands. She could not be blamed for this. It could only be said that this was a mysterious force coming from the East</p><br/><p>Su Li hoped that everyone would believe that she was good-hearted in nature. She happened to carry the pan, as she had been unlucky.</p><br/><p>Or else, how would a Doujinshi ero mangaka like her become the representative of all depressive series?</p><br/><p>Su Li only wanted to read the two lines of poetry, one of which should uphold this country\u2019s interestwhich was even more deceiving than Rosemary, the original author. She had to challenge him!</p><br/><p>Although Leng Zi did not have a Weibo, Zhao Youyue still shared the exquisite illustration to the group, which then received many positive comments, naturally. Su Li was already acclaimed by many of the readers as a great mangaka, and this illustration had truly mirrored the image of Goddess Chu!</p><br/><p>Han Leng always had mixed feelings for this Leng Zi fan group. His initial purpose of creating this fan group was to determine the feelings of Zhao Youyue towards this work. At that time, he had not \u201cfound a new love\u201d yet</p><br/><p>However, he never would have thought that \u201cBeautiful April\u201d would turn out so popular. It literally became the top-rated work among juvenile novels!</p><br/><p>\u201cMengya\u201d highly valued Han Leng too, hoping that his identity could be revealed, in order to promote him heavily. Well, he was a freshman in senior high, which meant that he was a talented high school student author. This was worthy of a large scale promotion campaign. It would only make his work all the more popular!</p><br/><p>However, Han Leng persistently refused it, as more and more fans had perceived \u201cLeng Zi\u201d as a female author. He was the one to be blamed for pulling off that stunt with his voice, before this</p><br/><p>He had spirited himself away after that and never appeared in the group again, and yet, he would always be lurking in the shadows.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, the number of the fans was increasing, and they became more active at the same time.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Han Leng saw the illustration of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 by Su Li. At that time, he was already uncontrollably obsessed with the Goddess Chu.</p><br/><p>Although the two dimensional cartoon drawing of her was totally different from the three dimensional one he saw in his mind whenever his writings kidnapped him into his world, he still secretly kept it on his cell phone. He had even set it as the wallpaper, immediately.</p><br/><p>He felt the utmost joy to be able to see the Goddess Chu every day, when he turns on his cell phone.</p><br/><p>Deep in his heart, Han Leng was very grateful to Zhao Yuyue. After all, this work could not have gained such popularity without her all-out promotion. Nevertheless, he would still do something childish when facing her</p><br/><p>Now, he finally could remain calm when facing her. Then, he noticed that Zhao Youyue was not as perfect as he had imagined. On the other hand, he had also noticed that she was even more big-hearted than he had initially perceived her to be, and he truly admired her poise and indifference.</p><br/><p>Han Leng had grown up. He felt that he was intoxicated, previously. His brain was disrupted by the sudden turbulence of puberty which caused him to have no clear understanding of Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Now, after he had sobered up, and his friendship with Zhao Youyue had been recovered, he was surprised to discover the feeling of a hedge between that which keeps friendship green.</p><br/><p>Han Leng no longer spoke awkwardly and could normally and naturally interact with Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>He did not want to dig deeper into the opinions of Zhao Youyue about this work anymore. It was enough for him to know that she liked it.</p><br/><p>Han Leng had decided he will reveal his identity after the work is completed. He had prepared himself mentally, no matter what she would take him as.</p><br/><p>All in all, Han Leng had now restored a good impression of Lady Zhao, a pure and good opinion, which excluded previous complicated and sentimental emotions.</p><br/><p>By this time, Jiang Qing, who was the first to buy the latest issue of \u201cMengya,\u201d had begun to read \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the beginning, she was undoubtedly reading it with joy, as \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was going to perform together with Gu Yuan again. As a hard-core fangirl \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 like her, their first performance had made her so high. Gu Yuan, who had slightly escaped from his psychological trauma, should be able to perform flawlessly with Chu Luoxun in this second performance, right?</p><br/><p>There was an expectant smile on Jiang Qing\u2019s face. She felt the Goddess Chu was especially superior when she read that The Goddess Chu forced the male protagonist to play the \u201cLiebesleid,\u201d completely ignoring his opinion. Perhaps this was bossy tenderness?</p><br/><p>Then, many running gags would make the readers laugh, during the practice sessions of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 and Gu Yuan. It was truly harmonious, yet amusing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing pitied Lin Meiyue, the heroine, the light bulb that was always there. She was so helpless. If it was not for the fact that Lin Meiyue had been set as a very nave and kind character, she would have already thought that the other party was a \u201cSketchy Yue\u201d\u2014she would have already noticed that \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was her biggest threat, and then raise her guard against \u201cChu Luxun\u201d, not leaving the two of them alone, by any chance.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, no one could stop their second performance!</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing hummed in her heart, eager to read their performance.</p><br/><p>However, what surprised her was \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019s\u2019 absence, on the day of their performance!</p><br/><p>At first, Jiang Qi had thought that Leng Zi was being mischievous again, using this trick again to whet readers\u2019 appetites. After all, the Goddess Chu will definitely appear magnificently and dazzlingly at the end!</p><br/><p>These creators are too cunning, always dropping a twist out of the blue!</p><br/><p>After reading \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 being insulted by a little violist, she sneered. Wait until the Goddess Chu teaches you how to be a human with music!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was still absent in the end.</p><br/><p>Instead, Gu Yuan dragged Lin Meiyue to the stage</p><br/><p>Why is it like this?</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing, the hard-core fangirl of \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 was struck by Leng Zi\u2019s first blade. Where was the promised ensemble?</p>\n</div>"}

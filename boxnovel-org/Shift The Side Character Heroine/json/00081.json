To be able to master two languages was already a good accomplishment, such as English and Chinese.</p><br/><p>Both English and Chinese are extremely important in this world, since these two are the most communicated languages worldwide. As a matter of fact, English is a compulsory subject in China and Chinese subject for European countries.</p><br/><p>Of course there are many other languages other than English and Chinese, such as French, German, Russian, Arabic Korean, Japanese and many more. Even though they are not widely used in Chinese or English, but those languages are indeed some tools for showing off, especially when only a minority of people knows how them.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it would be quite impressive if one could spend tremendous effort to master a couple of languages solely to show off.</p><br/><p>In order to be proficient in multiple languages in the novel, it only required a setting. Even foreigners could speak fluent Mandarin in a Chinese novel. In fact, foreigners were actually speaking in their mother tongue, but readers would literally interpret it as Chinese.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue gave \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d the ability to be proficient in multiple languages with a purpose. It mainly allowed her to mock her opponents elegantly without any means of vulgar words and also to crush her opponent\u2019s morale in competition. \u201cEternal War \u201d was a worldwide game in \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d setting, so how could \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d cause a scene during the world championship if she only knew Chinese?</p><br/><p>Granted with a wealthy family background by Rosemary, it was not awkward if Yu Shengfan she had learned multiple languages since young. Yu Shengfan was an internet addict too, and of course she wanted to test out every game regardless of its country. Some games were not translated into Chinese, so she had to pick up that particular language so that she could enjoy the game more. Know that she was a genius in both games and languages.</p><br/><p>The exaggerated description of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d had given Zhao Youyue more options to modify her character settings, she could even give her a golden finger. Thus, she never urged Rosemary to change her description, as this granted her more freedom to mess around in the novel world.</p><br/><p>Henceforth, having allowed Rosemary to exercise his new way of depicting a girl via the character of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, Zhao Youyue had indirectly hinted him to \u2014 add more, add more, add more scenes of Yu Shengfen!</p><br/><p>Other than proficient in multiple languages, her other character settings were based on the template of \u201cHuang Shaotian\u201d. But instead of spitting out vulgar words, she was set to be a little different.</p><br/><p>In \u201cThe King\u2019s Avatar\u201d, Huang Shaotian loved to talk c*ck. He could always be seen talking, of course, with vulgar words. He could even talk to himself when there was no one to talk to. While playing games, not only that his hands were moving the controls, his lips would be moving non-stop as well.</p><br/><p>The competition ended up setting a special rule just for him, that the players are banned from talking while their heroes are dead. Huang Shaotian looked like as if he was naive, but he was actually a very fine and careful person. He was also the kind of person who had very accurate judgements and would seize any opportunity in reaching distance.</p><br/><p>Some people thought that the trash words spitted by Huang Shaotian were rather Moe than vulgar, as it was not harsh nor venomous enough. It was just enough to make him turn from swordsman to a filthy man[2].</p><br/><p>What happens if both talkative and venomous tongues were put together as a single trait, would it generate a huge impact on it?</p><br/><p>To mock someone without any usage of vulgar words is not easy at all, unless one has a talent for languages. Words like \u201cf*** ur m**\u201d, \u201cur m**\u2019s c***\u201d, \u201cf*** ur m**\u2019s c***\u201d are too common, everybody knows it.</p><br/><p>To be able to scold someone without any vulgar words in a short time is rarely seen too, as if their mouths are moving turret gun, breaking opponent\u2019s morale just with words alone.</p><br/><p>These two traits were added into \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d language talent, just to give the readers a very deep impression on her.</p><br/><p>When \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d appeared in the novel with this \u201cfoul mouth\u201d state, it was interesting enough to imagine the expressions on the readers\u2019 faces. Her character seemed to be more amusing right now.</p><br/><p>In order for \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d to become more Moe and popular, she even set her voice to be Rie Kugimiya\u2019s lolita voice. This would cause some masochist fans to go uneasy whenever \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s\u201d scoldings were unheard \u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no meaning in life without the voice of Fanfan[1]!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can hear Fanfan\u2019s voice in my head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wished to get scolded by Fanfan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, this is what we called the \u201cFanfan\u2019s disease\u201d, full name \u201cYu\u2019s virus allergic brain fever\u201d.</p><br/><p>If Huang Shaotian was annoying, his female version \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d would be adorable. Rosemary had given her the beauty and wealth, and she would definitely become one of the players with the most poisonous mouth in the professional arena. Could \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d be adapted into an animation, there would be more \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s\u201d fans being tainted by this \u201cFanfan\u2019s disease\u201d!</p><br/><p>Since she had the lolita voice of Rie Kugimiya, might as well add in the tsundere trait. Even though she had a foul mouth, but she would be honest towards the main protagonist Lin Feng, becoming his most trusted pal and teammate. Her wealth would guarantee his team\u2019s performance, plus, her role will become more important, and her popularity will rise.</p><br/><p>In the novel of \u201cThe King\u2019s Avatar\u201d, Huang Shaotian was the opponent of the protagonist Ye Xiu. He only appeared to help the protagonist Ye Xiu with dungeon stages during the prologue, and disappeared throughout the series. However, he did appear once again during the epilogue, only to lose in the tournaments during the final. \u201cNo comment.\u201d That was the final words of Huang Shaotian on stage. That was the words that rendered everyone remembered him. Who could imagine or understand his feelings at that time? For a talkative person like him to become speechless at once.</p><br/><p>At last, Zhao Youyue was done setting up everything for \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d. She had her main abilities maxed out, and they were obviously gaming skills and language talent. As for characteristics, it was tsundere and foul mouth with the voice of Rie Kugimiya. In conclusion, this was almost the female version of Huang Shaotian, a gaming expert plus tsundere rich lady with Nagi Sanzenin\u2019s personality.</p><br/><p>After finalizing the abilities and characteristics of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, Zhao Youyue suddenly felt a strong urge to talk, as if she would fall sick if she did not speak. Luckily she could type it out to sooth her desire.</p><br/><p>As for now, Zhao Youyue had to solve a problem for Rosemary. Why would a filthy rich lady like \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d visited the cyber cafe for\u2026 internet?</p><br/><p>Translation Note :</p><br/><p>[1] Fanfan \u2013 Nickname of Yu Shengfan.</p><br/><p>[2] From swordman to filthy man () \u2013 sword and filthy have the same pronunciation in Chinese.</p>\n</div>"}

Every word he uttered regarding the tittle-tattles within the world of manga experts was well-grounded and reasoned. In this semester, he recommended several high-quality manga-s to his classmates. Therefore, he had some prestige in class. Those classmates who were interested in the world of manga was mainly because of Jiang Chao. Naturally they looked up to Jiang Chao as their leader and gradually created a small bunch in a united way. Unfortunately, this was a high school which was very particular about the examination results, as a consequence, there were no curricular activities in school. Otherwise, Jiang Chao would definitely organize a Manga Study Club.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Chao\u2019s current \u201cManga Study Club\u201d was on the verge of falling apart. For students who were not interested in manga, of course they were gloating over what had happened. The person who always disdained Jiang Chao was none other than Zhao Youyue\u2019s ex-deskmate, Zhou Fang. Crowing over the happenings, she had stretched her neck even higher to show her complacent expression. As a top student, Zhou Fang could never understand those fellars who wasted their time on meaningless manga-s and novels. She even felt that they were wasting their youth.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s current deskmate, Jiang Qing did not crow over Jiang Chao\u2019s misfortune. But she was very curious and concerned about the situation outside the classroom. She even asked Zhao Youyue to join the crowd. She subconsciously asked Zhao Youyue, \u201cLady Zhao, what do you think had happened between them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not answer but quickly came to a realization. Perhaps the destructive \u201cPure Romance\u2019s\u201d ending had made that bunch of boys who were happily chasing after \u201cPure Romance\u201d felt rather entrapped. After flashback of some memories, they recalled that it was Jiang Chao, this dumb-ass who had hard-sold \u201cPure Romance\u201d to them, leading them to be entrapped, and trusted the evil Drug Lord mangaka, Su Li!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was kind of guilty internally, in a sense that she was the mastermind behind the curtain who was manipulating \u201cPure Romance\u2019s\u201d storyline. She had no choice but wanted to use Xu Jing\u2019s ability in the manga to improve her examination results. However, she did not expect Su Li to have changed her from being a passer-by to a supporting character. At last, Su Li even decided to make her as the female protagonist.</p><br/><p>She could not be humble either since the creator had decided to make her a female protagonist. As a last resort, she could only use an extreme way to set up \u201cXu Jing\u2019s\u201d character. This was because \u201cPure Romance\u201d was a Harem manga which had something to do with the characters\u2019 IQ and most of the storyline relied on its erotic scenes. So how could \u201cXu Jing\u201d become a memorable iconic character that would be remembered by every reader in such Harem manga?!</p><br/><p>This is known as fighting fire with fire!</p><br/><p>Initially, Zhao Youyue resented Su Li, who tried hard to find fault within her. But she accidentally caused countless of readers ot be entrapped ruthlessly\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue was not the one to have taken the blame but these were all Su Li\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>Outside the classroom, Xu Haitao patted his chest and spoke to Jiang Chao with a pitiful expression, \u201cBrother Chao! I have really treated you as my own brother! I trusted you so much but why were you recommending \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 to me? That mangaka named Su Li, she is simply evil and of course a \u2018Drug Lord\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao felt shameful to answer Xu Haitao\u2019s complains as he had also held a strong grudge towards Su Li, the malevolent female mangaka.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao was currently becoming a fan who completely turned to the dark side!</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Jing\u201d was his goddess and eventually she was left behind with such an ending. Besides, that \u201cnice boat\u201d ending was simply a sinkhole for readers! This was a typical way of showing the readers some crappy stories and deliberately packaged the storyline into a chocolate with tempting looks!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how much I\u2019ve sacrificed for \u2018Pure Romance\u2019? In order to call on this bunch of fellars who were used to reading pirated manga online to support \u2018Drug Lord\u2019 Su Li, to read her original version, and even to tip \u2018Pure Romance\u2019, I had\u2026 allowed this bunch of fellars to touch my B-cup chest to vent their sexual desire after reading \u2018Pure Romance\u2019. After all of this, you\u2019re telling me that \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 has come to such an ending?! Now, I really want to end my life!\u201d The fats on Xu Haitao\u2019s face were trembling, he almost cried his heart out and felt wronged!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the surrounding \u201cManga Study Club\u2019s\u201d members were all silently lowering their heads, inexplicably wanted to laugh after listening to Xu Haitao\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao\u2019s former expression of a man who had nothing to live for immediately changed. He shouted, \u201cOh f*ck! There is such a trick?\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Jiang Chao reached out to Xu Haitao\u2019s chest. So this was the feeling of touching the legendary B-cup chest?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao immediately ran away after touching Xu Haitao\u2019s chest, and then Xu Haitao chased after Jiang Chao crazily. He wanted to catch Jiang Chao, so that he could hang him up and beat him as much as he could. As a result, both of them were caught and reprimanded by Mr. Qiu relentlessly. Mr. Qiu even warned them if both of them failed their final exams, they were going to be punished!</p><br/><p>Both of them showed an expression of feeling wronged. The ending of \u201cPure Romance\u201d made them even more depressed which they simply could not do well in their exams!</p><br/><p>Argh, they would definitely fail in the final exams!</p><br/><p>However, it was alright to fail the final exams as when they began their second semester, teachers would always forget about the warnings they gave in the previous semester.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue found herself very fulfilling in the three night-revision lessons. With the threatening of final exams, she forced herself to study and found a slight sensation just like how Xu Jing was obsessed with studying. When she thought she could directly use Xu Jing\u2019s ability in the future, her mood became joyful.</p><br/><p>When she was on her way home, she finally took out her phone in the car. At this moment, she felt really great playing with her hand phone. The first reason was that she actually endured for a long time. Secondly, she did her revision in a serious way and made her felt at peace of mind, therefore, when she was playing her phone, she came out to be convincing and faithful self.</p><br/><p>She started scrolling Weibo and found out the ending of \u201cPure Romance\u201d had become Weibo\u2019s hot topic!</p><br/><p>\u201cDarkened\u201d, \u201cCleaver\u201d and \u201cNice boat\u201d these words became so common all of a sudden. Besides, the character name that everyone mentioned the most was none other than Xu Jing!</p><br/><p>This was definitely due to Xu Jing\u2019s character who turned out to be the most controversial ever. Her experiences in the manga as well as her character itself were the most overflowing thing in \u201cPure Romance\u201d. It could even be said that she was the only one who had IQ, while the one with the IQ of 250, missy Liu Sha, she was actually rather silly, not really sensible and stubborn. Before Xu Jing plotted against the male protagonist just because of Yang Xixi, with her own ability, Xu Jing revenged in replace for her parents. This led to a lot of discussions at once and almost no one dared to question Xu Jing\u2019s retaliated behaviour, as her vengeance really did work off one\u2019s anger and seemed rather enjoyable.</p><br/><p>However, just when Xu Jing plotted against the male protagonist due to her distorted love towards Yang Xixi, Xu Jing had turned into a darkened self and this gradually triggered the debates. Since the ending of \u201cPure Romance\u201d had been released, the debates about this character and the dissatisfaction with the ending had also reached its peak!</p><br/><p>Lastly, Su Li\u2019s promise was totally a joke!</p>\n</div>"}

She started with a few Silver Ranked games on her subsidiary account in LOL. The audience loved how she provoked and taunted her enemies while carrying the game and earning MVP title. Zhao Youyue\u2019s gameplay of slaughtering the noobs was more exciting than anything else.</p><br/><p>It was more thrilling, as those games had malfunctioning teammates, and horrendous teamwork, yet Zhao Youyue always carried the team, turning the tide and earning the victory.</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo was impressed by how Zhao Youyue carried out her broadcasts. Apparently, she was not just about looks, her gaming skill and vainglorious way of talking were humorous in their unique ways.</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo left it at there and thought that she was just a game broadcaster. Yet, he dropped his jaw when she started accepting song requests, while picking up a violin and preparing to sing.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu\u2019s contact details may be beyond his reach, but a song request should be reasonable. Tian Shenluo prepared himself, and dropped a song request \u201cA Little Happiness\u201d on the bullet screen.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not one bit ruffled after Tian Shenluo had asked for her WeChat contact. Such requests were pretty common, along with rockets, long before she showed her face. Most female broadcasters often responded positively, under such circumstances.</p><br/><p>After all, those WeChat accounts provided by broadcasters were not private accounts; they were created just to entertain these gifters. What if one of them was an actual God of Tycoons?</p><br/><p>Besides, Douyu would receive no share of transactions through WeChat.</p><br/><p>Broadcasters only wanted to maintain the relationship with the authentic wealthy folk. Only these people were worthy to learn of a broadcasters\u2019 private WeChat account, since they could hand them gifts anytime they felt like doing so.</p><br/><p>Even hundred rockets were as simple as it sounded to Zhao Youyue. She was awed with Boss Hao\u2019s spending power. 3,000 rockets cost more than 1,500,000 RMB.</p><br/><p>Who could Boss Hao be in the real world?</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo\u2019s song request of \u201cA Little Happiness\u201d did not escape Zhao Youyue. It was a song popular in both worlds, and she accepted it willingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Little Happiness\u201d was a song performed by Hebe Tien. Lyrics were written by Xu Shizhen and Wu Huifu, and it was composed by JerryC for the movie \u201cOur Times.\u201dIt immediately became everyone\u2019s favorite and a must-sing song among broadcasters after the movie went on screen.</p><br/><p>Instinctively, Zhao Youyue activated \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s Card\u201d with a great smile on her face. Goddess Chu\u2019s mind was always vast and peaceful. Music brought the sun in her mind, brightening up her world.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s aura was surprisingly powerful, leaving Tian Shenluo stoned in front of the screen, as he focused on her performance.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not use a guitar. Instead, she sang with an easily obtained backing track. It was a popular choice of song for broadcasters.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s audio equipment were the best in the market. She intended to give nothing but a high-quality live show to her audience. With the clear, crisp backing track, she started singing</p><br/><p>I heard the raindrops plunge onto a green field of grass</p><br/><p>I heard the recess bell clang in the far distance</p><br/><p>But I did not hear your voice</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>I was fortunate to have met you</p><br/><p>But I have lost the right to shed tears for you</p><br/><p>I just hope that at the edge of the sky that escapes my sight</p><br/><p>You\u2019re opening your wings</p><br/><p>Flying to your Mrs. Right</p><br/><p>She is so lucky</p><br/><p>Under the effect of the \u201cChu Luoxun card,\u201d the song surpassed its original level. Every time she sang, comments saying \u201cmuch better than the original\u201d would pop up.</p><br/><p>Again, she touched the heart of her viewers with her rendition of \u201cA Little Happiness.\u201d It was a shame that the \u201cSpiritual Music\u201d effect was not triggered, since the audience was not experiencing it in person.</p><br/><p>Even so, the audience had no way of saying that it was not well done. They sincerely believed that she did better than the original singer!</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful, a big like to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yu, meeting you is also a little happiness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a sweet voice, it would be good if you make your own album\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will you have your own concert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDownloaded, going to repeat it for the whole day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song was like a drug after going through \u201cYuficication\u201d, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m officially a junkie, I just can\u2019t fight it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo had wanted to launch a few rockets when the chorus was at the climax, if only he had any Fish Fins left to spend. He was still a university student, studying in the United State of America. He would soon graduate and inherit his family business, but as of now, he was still unemployed.</p><br/><p>It was easy for him to send gifts worth hundred of thousands on a monthly basis, but such hefty gifting in such a short period of time really did take a toll on his account. Of course, it had something to do with the fact that he had recently launched hundreds of rockets for a Korean female broadcaster that he was fond of</p><br/><p>Everything was now clear to Tian Shenluo. Ah Yu\u2019s \u201cA Little Happiness\u201d performance, was all the reason he needed to know why she had attained such a high level of popularity. She was outstanding in every way, she was talented, she was beautiful!</p><br/><p>There was nothing wrong with the pioneer tycoon Boss Hao. She was worth every penny spent!</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo sincerely praised her in bullet screen. Ah Yu\u2019s gratified response surprised him. Apparently, his message on bullet screen worth much more than hundreds of rockets!</p><br/><p>Such was Chu Luoxun\u2019s nature. She took note of those who loved her music. All she ever wanted was to bring happiness to others with her music. Tian Shenluo had found himself a unique and outstanding broadcaster.</p><br/><p>He searched Ah Yu on the internet curiously, and was amazed by what he found. This broadcaster was a high school student,and she also excelled in studies and sports!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, a name that he could not forget. When he returns to China, he would look for her. Who knows, they might even be the best of friends.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue ended her face-reveal broadcast. She was on the breaking news of a lot of media. Within two hours of her stream, she had received more than 2,000,000 RMB!</p><br/><p>Such an abominable number!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

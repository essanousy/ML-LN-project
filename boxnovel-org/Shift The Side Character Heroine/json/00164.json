Also, she would not hesitate to support those creators financially.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, under the voluntary promotion of a reader like her, her favorites would receive notice of more readers. Its popularity would increase, for sure.</p><br/><p>After she decided to mold an iconic character by using \u201cBeautiful April\u201d, she started executing her plans of increasing this work\u2019s popularity.</p><br/><p>She even recommended \u201cBeautiful April\u201d in her Introduction of Big Books List which had over a hundred thousand followers. Although the effect was limited, it was better than nothing.</p><br/><p>Then, she recommended it via her Weibo as well. She soon saw that she had very few fans in Weibo, which was only in the thousands, excluding those VIPs.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a more precise goal came into her mind. Not only did she want to become a VIP of Qi Dian, she wanted to become a VIP on the internet as wello. For this, she can take advantage of her popularity to recommend any book that she shifts into.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she could also help enhance \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s\u201d streaming studio.</p><br/><p>But the problem was, how does one become a \u201cBig V\u201d with more discourse power?</p><br/><p>For Zhao Youyue, she had really zero clue about this. Being an independent person, she never thought of seeking help from her cousins, Zhao Hao and Zhang Wanjun. Both of them were \u201cBig Vs\u201d of Wei Bo with over millions of fans.</p><br/><p>Actually, in contrast to her low profile personality, she could have just shown off her luxurious life, even if she gets condemned by some people in the process. This, too, would stir up the effects of promotion, right?</p><br/><p>As usual, Zhao Youyue was playing with her cell phone. Then, she entered the Tieba of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d by chance. This must be the platform where most of its fans had gathered.</p><br/><p>The latest \u201cMeng Ya\u201d will be published in several days; readers have begun to discuss fervently on Tieba about the most recent serial. Everyone was anticipating the innocent romance between the main characters. It has been a long time since they last read a work that is so pure, yet, close to reality.</p><br/><p>This was mainly because the romance between the main characters has been exaggerated in recent juvenile romance novels. It was so abnormal, especially in the feminine oriented novels. Either the main character, or the supporting actor would be the most handsome one in school. If not, how would he possibly match the ordinary heroine, right?</p><br/><p>The surreal mixture of realism and fantasy was what made Leng Zi\u2019s \u201cBeautiful April\u201d so precious. \u201cIngenious\u201d was the only word that can describe those little rapport, sweetness and details. It would make one want to roll in the bed with it</p><br/><p>This juvenile novel is certainly suitable for both genders.</p><br/><p>Moreover, most of the readers will definitely support this couple and, in the meantime, suggest that Leng Zi refrains from complicating things with a messy love triangle.</p><br/><p>A Tieba user whose id was [Your brother Hao], perhaps was too keen to see a happy ending for the main characters, left a post firmly saying \u201cAlthough Leng Zi has promised that this is going to be a high school comedy with happy ending, but recently the heroine\u2019s bestie is being disgusting. So, I must remind him not to create an awful triangle love, once again! I don\u2019t want to see any cheating from the male protagonist, even though I am a man! I hope that Leng Zi takes note of this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, many readers supported this user, including Zhao Youyue. But, she got that sense of superiority after knowing that she could shift into the work to help the couple, while other the readers cannot.</p><br/><p>Besides that, Zhao Youyue was delighted after realizing that many readers were gossiping about the legendary character, \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d saying that they were anticipating her appearance.</p><br/><p>From thereon, there were many speculations that she was going to be the male protagonist\u2019s opponent or the big villain. She was at a higher level than Wang Yan and might be a threat to the heroine</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue suddenly laughed, thinking that this was impossible. All she wanted to do was to help the couple achieve a happy ending.</p><br/><p>Hahaha! How could \u201cChu Luoxin\u201d manage to threaten the heroine, what a joke!</p><br/><p>Then, her eyes sparkled when she found out a QR code of Leng Zi\u2019s fans group on Tieba. She immediately clicked into it, to realize that many users had added it. Some even commented that Leng Zi was a female!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue chuckled, as she had expected. Now, she flattered herself that she could distinguish the gender of the author through its writing style due to her extensive reading.</p><br/><p>Normally, the finer and more sensitive of the writing style is, the author must be a female.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for a rough, uncaring man to write romance in such sensitive way, right?</p><br/><p>Subconsciously, Zhao Youyue imagined Leng Zi as the heroine, \u201cLin Meiyue,\u201d whom she felt familiar with. At that moment, her good feeling of Leng Zi increased by twenty-fold</p><br/><p>But, it will dramatically decrease by two hundred fold if Leng Zi\u2019s true identity is going to be revealed eventually</p><br/><p>Well, it can be concluded that Han Leng was seeking for death in his trick again.</p><br/><p>Without further consideration, Zhao Youyue added the QR code: 517637875.</p><br/><p>Just as she entered the group, she noticed that there was only about a dozen of fans. Most of them were the active one n Tieba, and there was no admin.</p><br/><p>In fact, not many people welcomed her. It seemed like a dead group. But, Leng Zi must be here otherwise she would not be approved so quickly. She would not know that Leng Zi always paid attention to this group, waiting for her to join. He was already holding his breath, waiting for Miss Zhao to comment.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Zhao Youyue gave him ten slogan red packets, each worth 100 RMB\u2014-I really like this work!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1.

First, she would get a high popularity character card as a sacrifice. Then, she would transmigrate into a piece of work where she could confidently create an iconic character. The work would be created by herself, it was a brilliant idea.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Shi Jingnian was not the type of person who loved stalking others. He was never the one who took the initiative, but neither did he reject any requests, and was all in all, very responsible. Whenever a pretty girl asked him for help, he would try his best to help and did not expect anything in return.</p><br/><p>Of course, Shi Jingnian\u2019s standards of beauty were very high. It could be said that all the girls who were capable of capturing his attention were really extremely beautiful and had great temperaments. They were definitely not vulgar in any way.</p><br/><p>Some girls were just too kind. As they had accepted Shi Jingnian\u2019s help previously, they would naturally feel indebted to him. They would have trouble sleeping if they were unable to return the favor. Thus, they had unknowingly fallen into his trap.</p><br/><p>Then, there were those like lady Lu Xue, who was full of confidence, thinking that she could cure him of his flirtatious behavior. Hence, she had temporarily joined his \u2018harem,\u2019 maintaining a low profile, while waiting for a crucial time to stir up some trouble.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was the smartest. She would not use her kindness on Shi Jingnian. She could secure this genius creator in the palm of her hand without any sort of psychological burden. The moment she successfully created an iconic literary girl character, she would completely cut Shi Jingnian off.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, judging by how he was always so suave whenever he interacted with girls, he definitely would not care even if Zhao Youyue left.</p><br/><p>A suave guy like him who could remain unabashed even with thousands of beautiful girls by his side, it was most certainly someone who was familiar with the art of love.</p><br/><p>However, it was a pity as Zhao Youyue did not fall for his tricks at all. Her \u201cside-character aura\u201d could completely subdue his \u201charem aura.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Shi Jingnian finally had a look Zhao Youyue\u2019s cameo idea. Initially, he felt quite frustrated. To him, \u201cBakuman\u201d was going to become a masterpiece in the field of scientific literature. It would touch on not only the traditional literary world, but also the web literary world. He was a senior internal manager in the web novel world, after all. He had already entrapped several million readers. If this identity was exposed, he would most definitely become a street mouse\u2026</p><br/><p>As he had high expectations for \u201cBakuman,\u201d he did not want any boring characters to appear in the book. However, after looking at the setting of \u201cWen Qingyu,\u201d his eyes lit up in excitement. It did not matter whether \u201cWen Qingyu\u201d becomes a creator. The cameo idea of her appearing as a reader that shouts nothing but \u201c666\u201d was actually quite interesting!</p><br/><p>After all, her ability to eat books and rate them was similar to the ability to taste good food. It could be used to judge the quality of the works of other creators. If the work was of a different genre, it would be similar to indulging in a different type of cuisine. In actuality, all of them were delicious.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian had great knowledge, as he had \u201cread thousands of books and walked thousands of miles.\u201d Those famous notes that were attached to various masterpieces were all written by him. He did not research much on food, or, to be more exact, did not really have a good appetite. However, he has eaten plenty of good food before, and has read tons of masterpieces. Even so, he had never thought of linking the two together like this.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s cameo idea had given him a huge burst of inspiration!</p><br/><p>This made him even more interested in Zhao Youyue. It also made him think that although the lady Zhao Youyue was the arrogant kind of girl, and treated him coldly, she dearly cared about him. If not, why would she, without any hesitation, gift him with the idea of such a great character?</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian decided that he would make sure this character is thoroughly written, to return Zhao Youyue\u2019s favor.</p><br/><p>Obviously, he had no idea that from the beginning to the end, he had been a pawn under the control of Miss Zhao. He was only a tool for Zhao Youyue to achieve her objectives, and he would be abandoned after use.</p><br/><p>Time went by, and Zhao Youyue\u2019s first semester in high school came to an end. During the winter holidays, Zhao Youyue\u2019s \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d had finally cooled down and reactivated.</p><br/><p>\u201cBakuman\u201d had also been announced as Ya Jing\u2019s new work. It was to be serialized in the famous literary magazine \u201cHarvest.\u201d When an article about it was serialized, readers responded warmly. Many creators in the industry had also started paying attention to it. Some people had already started looking up for real people who possibly matched the various characters.</p><br/><p>The side-character \u201cWen Qingyu\u201d who started off purely as a reader was already receiving love from some readers. They felt that this girl who ate books was really cute, but it was a pity that she did not appear to have many scenes.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Zhao Youyue had a high chance of achieving a \u2018sleeping victory\u2019 this time. Then again, if it was not the work of an outstanding creator, why would she sacrifice her precious, high popularity character card to enter this world?</p><br/><p>No matter how irritating Shi Jingnian was, his talent was undeniable, and impeccable. Zhao Youyue had also looked at the song he wrote her. Obviously, it was not as good as the songs originally written by Chu Luoxun, so Zhao Youyue had casually tossed it aside.</p><br/><p>That night, Zhao Youyue instantly decided to sacrifice the \u201cZhou Chun\u201d high popularity character card, which had been obtained from \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d. The character card that was originally full of life at the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d gradually fell apart. Then, it transformed into a key, which could be used to enter works that were one level higher, at random, or, it could also be used as a tool to directly enter works of similar levels.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that \u201cBakuman\u201d was of the same level, hence Zhao Youyue entered successfully!</p><br/><p>This time, Zhao Youyue did not have to work as hard as she always did when thrown into an unknown world at random. She was fully prepared.</p><br/><p>She decisively chose to transmigrate as \u201cWen Qingyu,\u201d and skillfully added some settings for her. At the same time, she requested that Shi Jingnian add more scenes for Wen Qingyu, as usual.</p><br/><p>If the character Wen Qingyu did not attract Shi Jingnian in the first place, he would have been in a difficult position. However, this character had caught the eye of several readers, as stated in the readers\u2019 survey. At the same time, he found it really easy to write about her. Hence, he happily agreed to Zhao Youyue\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian still tried to play around with Zhao Youyue a little. He expressed that he cared about Zhao Youyue too much, which was why he was so fond of this side-character that Zhao Youyue had requested for him to add.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, who had already seen through everything, just laughed.</p><br/><p>After she successfully transmigrated as Wen Qingyu, Zhao Youyue decided to look for Su Li. She intended to have her to draw some illustrations for this character, to further build up some momentum for Wen Qingyu\u2026</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian had recently become addicted to writing. Caught up with being \u201cintoxicated,\u201d he had unknowingly neglected the demanding lady, Lu Xue. She felt that Shi Jingnian, who was helping his official girlfriend to write novels, was biased!</p><br/><p>Lu Xue, the genius violinist who was placed below Zhao Youyue in the just-concluded national music competition, could not endure such treatment any longer.</p><br/><p>Although Lu Xue had only been placed second in the competition, she had also gained popularity on the internet because of her beauty and her family background, as she was the rich daughter of a coal boss. In actuality, she became popular because of Zhao Youyue. After all, Zhao Youyue was way more popular than her. She was inferior to Zhao Youyue, plain and simple. It was quite unfortunate\u2026 Zhao Youyue\u2019s musical talent was just too unsurpassable.</p><br/><p>However, some netizens who did not know the truth truly believed that Lu Xue had a better family background than Zhao Youyue. Did they not know that it was not possible to find out about someone\u2019s family background through the internet? According to the laws and regulations, if someone\u2019s family background does not appear anywhere in the search results, doesn\u2019t that mean that they\u2019re the real deal?</p><br/><p>No matter how rich the coal boss was, he was too inferior to be shown in public.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

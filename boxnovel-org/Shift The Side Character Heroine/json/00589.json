Even so, she hesitated. Her failure this time had taught her much. Dealing with Lady Zhao was no easy matter. She was surrounded by \u201cthe forces of evil.\u201d The other big bosses had no objections, so how could she stand against it alone? That would be suicide.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because Qiao Fei was not brainless and that her \u201cinflexibly just and fair\u201d was only a mask, she was doomed to fail. Ironically, if she was not that person, she would not have even been able to be the President of the Discipline Inspection Department.</p><br/><p>Being inflexibly just and fair towards people who were of no value, but bending the rules for those who would be of some use to her was how she functioned. Sadly, she had experienced the misfortune of underestimating Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yongnian\u2019s proposal was unanimously accepted. Everyone was actually pretty happy about it. An influential person joining the Student Council would help to further expand the power of the Student Council. No one had even anticipated Zhao Youyue directly using her identity as the Vice President of the Literature and Arts Department to run as President of the Student Council.</p><br/><p>Obviously, this was a major oversight. In everyone\u2019s opinion, the Literature and Arts Department was an unimportant department. It was just like a mascot, and it had was poorly funded. Even the President of the Literature and Arts Department would not bring disgrace upon himself by announcing that he wanted to run for President of the Student Council, let alone the Vice President. In everyone\u2019s minds, the next President of the Student Council was probably Qiao Fei, if the current trajectory remained. After all, she had a lot of experience when it came to the operations of the Student Council, and she was also popular among the students. Many presidents of various big societies also favored her. If not her, who else could be elected?</p><br/><p>Her failure this time did not come as much of a surprise. This was her first time running for President. Of course her inexperience would fail her. Moreover, she actually attempted to go to war with a well-known celebrity like Lady Zhao. Did she really think that Lady Zhao\u2019s hardcore fans would sit back and do nothing?</p><br/><p>She had learned much from this election. Now, she probably knew how to navigate these waters. This was the key to being the President of the Student Council. When it came to the President of the Student Council, there was no place for dictatorship.</p><br/><p>On that night, the Student Council hosted a banquet to welcome the new President. Presidents of various prominent societies and many campus celebrities attended the banquet. Their cronies had tagged along, of course. For those who were keen on obtaining more power in their universities, this banquet was just another one of the \u201cupper class\u201d banquets of the university.</p><br/><p>As the President of the Food Research Department and a campus idol, Zhao Youyue also attended the banquet. Of course, the famous writer Han Leng came along with her. With Han Leng at her side, Lady Zhao would not have to worry about annoying flies.</p><br/><p>In this world, thick-skinned flies like Cao Chuanguang rarely came. Many boys were aware of their places. As long as a girl has clearly expressed that she already had her eyes on someone else, boys would not put themselves in an unnecessary struggle.</p><br/><p>When faced with supreme opponents, these boys would not even consider fighting for it. They would simply accept their sad fate.</p><br/><p>A genius writer who was as famous and good-looking as Han Leng simply bedazzled his peers. Moreover, many have realized that this genius writer would always be around Lady Zhao. Although their relationship remained unclear, they were evidently in good terms. This was enough to send boys retreating.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue attended the banquet with a bang of an entrance. She also tried the \u201cZhang Guorong\u201d character card out. After all, former movie stars that have once been crowned as Queen Actresses always had to attend countless banquets. Sometimes, movie stars had a lot more experience when it came to presenting their perfect sides to everyone.</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhao Youyue had ample experience in this. However, she only attended these events because she had to act like a missy and retain that image. It was the only face she had ever shown the world. It could not be helped. If she did not pretend to be a missy, she was just an ordinary side-character. However, when she pretended to be a missy, she basically turned everything into confetti. It was too fanciful and elaborate. A smarter person would definitely notice something off. Her missy image seemed a little forced, didn\u2019t it? It was similar to the characters in various novels and mangas\u2026</p><br/><p>Even Zhao Youyue preferred to give off a more natural, modest Missy vibe that did not seem off-putting to others. However, an ordinary person would never be able to act out such a role. Only a true missy could act like one. Ordinary creators could only create their fictionalized, fantasied versions of Missies.</p><br/><p>With the \u201cZhang Guorong\u201d card, paired with her perfect evening gown, she appeared on the scene of the banquet just like a superstar. A touch of delicate makeup added some divinity to her perfect visage. Her graceful, magnificent temperament blew everyone else away!</p><br/><p>This was not Zhao Youyue herself, but a legendary actress who once made history, and recently remade it again \u2013 the \u201cQueen with A Thousand Faces,\u201d Zhang Guorong!</p><br/><p>Zhang Guorong knew just how to act like a superstar. She always became the focus of journalists no matter the event. She had been born to complete the spotlight!</p><br/><p>This was the so-called \u201cphotogenic\u201d trait. In this world, some humans could be graced with stunning looks, but looked pedestrian in pictures. Celebrities were the total opposite. Even if they looked ordinary in reality, cameras turned them into deities!</p><br/><p>Of course if one already looked good to begin with, cameras would rip holes in reality. Undoubtedly, Zhang Guorong was such a character!</p><br/><p>To be precise, it was the fictionalized version of Zhang Guorong, a perfect actress, and celebrity created in \u201cPerfect Acting \u2013 A Lifetime Of Wonderful Youth.\u201d Only her true friends might be able to tell how the real Zhang Guorong was like.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao robbed everyone else of the limelight. Everyone had forgotten that the banquet was held to welcome the new President of the Student Council. It was most definitely not a red carpet event for a movie premiere. When Lady Zhao appeared, a figurative red carpet had rolled out, figurative curtains descended, and a stage ascended!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yongnian was just as stunned. He stared at Lady Zhao in awe, the superstar that she was. She had ripped the soul out of him. Was this how a hardcore fan felt, in the face of his idol?</p></div>\n</div>"}

It was just to announce her presence</p><br/><p>Since Zhao Youyue first joined the book friend group with the pen name of \u201cI\u2019m the best\u201d and then this group, she had already evolved from a goofy-cutie amateur into an experienced reader.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, she still liked to browse through those miscellaneous groups, but she seldom did so after entering senior high due to time insufficiency. [So-called lady] with the group number: 272077752 was the best! It consisted of friendly sisters. She hoped to become their bestie and travel together someday.</p><br/><p>After the \u201cI really like this work!\u201d slogan red packets was sent out, several group members appeared out of sudden in that \u201cdead group.\u201d Of course, Leng Zi was the fastest one.</p><br/><p>Always known as someone with \u201csharp eyes and agile hands [1]\u201d, Han Leng was dumbfounded as he was only able to snatch a red packet of \u201c25.8 [2]\u201d.</p><br/><p>It was once hard for him to even grab a one RMB red packet in his \u201cWeb Game: Conquering the World\u201d book group. But, now, this was a twenty plus RMB one. This was totally a big bumper red packet!</p><br/><p>A bitter smile curved his lips when he recalled her status of a rich man\u2019s daughter. That\u2019s right, this fella was inhumane, having no sense of presence in reality, but not on the internet.</p><br/><p>This quite matched with the setting of the heroine, \u201cLin Meiyue,\u201d of his new novel. She was passive in taking the initiative to talk with the male protagonist, Gu Yuan, but not in WeChat.</p><br/><p>Han Leng immediately sent out an emoticon of \u201cworshiping the boss,\u201d kneeling and licking Miss Zhao\u2019s boots, following with a message \u201cThank you, Godly Tycoon! \u201d</p><br/><p>Other group members were amazed by her action which was really like that of a boss. She had spontaneously given out the red packets, each worth one hundred RMB. So generous!</p><br/><p>Being adored by the members and showered by the gratitude from Leng Zi, it made her extremely happy.</p><br/><p>She could not help it. She naturally adored the author of the work that she liked, and the feeling doubled after knowing that Leng Zi was a female. Compared to the male author, this would give them more mutual topics of interests.</p><br/><p>Spurred by such emotions, Zhao Youyue sent a 200 RMB red packet again but, this time, it was exclusively for Leng Zi. This was the highest possible amount of a QQ red packet.</p><br/><p>Han Leng\u2019s agility at grabbing red packet was at auto-pilot, in fear of reading that one, heart-wrenching phrase\u2014-</p><br/><p>You are late, I\u2019m all finished~</p><br/><p>He gasped when he looked at this red packet. This Miss Zhao is such a willful person.</p><br/><p>Honestly, Leng Zi was reluctant to receive her red packet. It felt as if he would place himself in her debt.</p><br/><p>Actually, he felt terrible after he began avoiding Zhao Youyue. He felt helpless and, at the same time, utterly hopeless.</p><br/><p>Writing was the only way for him to make up for the regret.</p><br/><p>Revealing his identity was impossible, as he was still masquerading as the hipster female author, \u201cLeng Zi.\u201d Therefore, he could only keep expressing his gratitude to Zhao Youyue in this way. On the other hand, other members were commenting that said\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Zi, looks like this fan truly loves you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe highest valued bumper red packet This is my first time seeing one, I am so jealous of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be the legendary [You Yue] Tycoon? Tsk, never thought that [You Yue] Tycoon, famous Tycoon reader of Qi Dian, would read physical novels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee through.jpg\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Zi, please reveal a picture of yourself, your voice, your body measurements. This \u2018true love\u2019 fan is so supportive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not ask [You Yue] Tycoon to reveal itself?\u201d</p><br/><p>As an experienced reader, she was not as shy as before while being ridiculed. This time, she chuckled and, by using voice message, gently said \u201cI do not mind as long as Leng Zi reveals the picture of herself. I guess that Leng Zi must be pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of sudden, Zhao Youyue\u2019s gentle and soothing voice made the group flutter to life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, [You Yue] Tycoon really is a girl! He voice sounds good too! Apparently, the rumor is true, that [You Yue] is not only a rich man\u2019s daughter, but a very pretty lady!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI sincerely think that her voice is nice. I\u2019ve known that she must be gorgeous, just by listening to her voice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Youyue, do you still need any leg pendants [3]?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to ask Miss Zhao this: How is your daily life as a noble?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Zhao has revealed her voice. How about you, Leng Zi?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Han Leng began come down with cold sweat. All of this was obtuse. Zhao Youyue is such a bastard!</p><br/><p>This would make him look very passive. Why must he reveal his voice? If he does so, everyone will know that he is a man.</p><br/><p>No way!</p><br/><p>He can\u2019t afford to have his cover blown, especially not when he was still unsure about Zhao Youyue\u2019s overall impression on this work. However, a preliminary conclusion can be drawn. She probably tilted more on the positive side, based on the red packet that had been given exclusively to \u201cLeng Zi.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, knowing that was useless. That day, after seeing her read it seriously, he had guessed that Zhao Youyue should approve of his work.</p><br/><p>This definitely gave him some pleasure and had boosted his motivation in writing. As he has said before, one day, he would make Zhao Youyue tip him voluntarily. Now, that desire has been fulfilled</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Han Leng was still eager to know her overall impression of his work. The word \u201cGood\u201d was not sufficient.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he was not cool with the male members who were insanely trying to hook up with her. Although he was the one who avoided her at first, he had not been prepared for this. He could not stand other guys approaching her!</p><br/><p>So, he decided to use his secret weapon\u2014voice changer. That\u2019s right, this incredible software can turn a lolita\u2019s voice into an uncle\u2019s voice, and a man\u2019s voice into a woman\u2019s voice!</p><br/><p>Helplessly, he felt like he had fallen into the chasm of \u201d Nv Zhung Da Lao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng, no, \u201cLeng Zi\u201d replied by saying \u201cLet\u2019s just skip the picture of myself. Everyone should be more interested in my work, rather than my average look\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice changer turned his voice into a lady\u2019s voice that sounded indifferent and pompous, like a cold, arrogant goddess.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1.

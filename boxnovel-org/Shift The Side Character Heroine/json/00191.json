Throughout the journey, he could feel the goodness of his wife even more.</p><br/><p>In life, Ye Hai was a lazy and careless man. He sometimes couldn\u2019t even remember where he had placed his information book, but as long as Li Mengyao is there, she would manage to find it.</p><br/><p>As usual, she had prepared all the things for this journey. Barring any unwanted circumstances, they would enjoy themselves here for few days, letting their parents look after their kid.</p><br/><p>All in all, Ye Hai was 120% satisfied with his wife. He could not imagine how his life would be if he leaves her. It must be terrible.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he will never cheat on her.</p><br/><p>The incident of the female Douyu Streamer, \u201cAh Yu,\u201d was merely an accident. He just wanted to be clear about whether it was true that the character he created had transmigrated into reality</p><br/><p>They reached the province on Friday, and Su Li picked them up. When Ye Hai saw Su Li, he sighted that she was young and beautiful. Although they had met each other before to discuss the copyright contract terms, her charm had increased even more, now.</p><br/><p>Of course, the credit went to Zhao Youyue. Su Li has become a famous Grand mangaka, with millions of Weibo followers and a yearly income that exceeded millions of RMB.</p><br/><p>Money can be traded with beauty once the woman becomes rich. Plastic surgery was the easiest way.</p><br/><p>However, Su Li did not need it as she was a natural beauty. It was just that she had not emphasized on keeping fit, previously. Now, she had Lady Zhao as her guide and role model. Hence, Su Li\u2019s charm has increased significantly.</p><br/><p>Well, the proverb saying \u201cOne who touches rouge will be stained red, one who touches ink will be stained black,\u201d exists for a reason. Even her temperament had changed, becoming bighearted, as she actively contacted Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>Su Li greeted the man\u2019s wife enthusiastically. In fact, she was more familiar with Li Mengyao than Ye Hai. Maybe it was because both of them were women, having a mutual topic.</p><br/><p>After seeing the close relationship between them, he suddenly thought of the Yuri plot between Xu Jing and Yang Xixi in Su Li\u2019s first work, \u201cPure Romance.\u201d He felt some greens [1] growing on his head</p><br/><p>Well, Ye Hai chose to forgive her!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the atmosphere between them was pleasant. Anyway, they have had a successful collaboration before, which enabled \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d to achieve great results through their hard work.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yea! Ye Grand Author, I have invited Lady Zhao to go together with us tomorrow, and check out to see who this \u201cAh Yu\u201d actually is.\u201d Su Li thought about it and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Lady Zhao?\u201d Ye Hai could not react for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Zhao Yue tycoon, Miss Youyue who tipped you the Golden Sect Master by using the Qidian account called [I Am Youyue\u2019s Biological Brother]. It is by her hand too, right?\u201d Su Li explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see! That Miss Youyue! I would never have thought that her surname really is Zhao! The Zhaos, tsk tsk.\u201d Ye Hai managed to react now. He had always called Zhao Youyue \u201cMiss Youyue,\u201d and that was why he did not know her surname.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis means that her name is Zhao Youyue?\u201d Li Mengyao interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Her name is Zhao Youyue, with the unpredictable background. I could not believe that a missy like her likes to read novel and manga\u201d Su Li added.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. It is unbelievable that a reader would tip a book with one hundred thousand RMB, let alone, ten thousand RMB at once!\u201d Li Mengyao was feeling confused, when she recalled the day \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d got the Golden Sect Master!</p><br/><p>Well, no one would understand the world of the wealthy person, tipping one hundred thousand RMB like it was nothing</p><br/><p>However, they had misunderstood Zhao Youyue. For her, it was actually heart-breaking to tip ten thousand RMB at once. Unlike her cousin, Zhao Hao, the wealthy second generation who was as rich as the son of the richest man, Ding Yuncong. Wait, he should be third generation, as his surname was Zhao, as well.</p><br/><p>Since Ding Yuncong generously gave away supercars worth ten million RMB to the participants of Esports, Zhao Huo tipping a book with Golden Sect Master should be nothing right?</p><br/><p>Ten thousand RMB? Not a big deal. It was not even sufficient for Zhao Hao to buy high standard non-ranking equipment in the \u201cFantasy Westward Journey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those High God super tycoon fans had such financial power too, but they were too lazy to make that move, as there was no more \u201cGod of Wars\u201d in this era. Even the super tycoon would never beat the game operators</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never seen Miss Zhao Youyue before, but her photo. Since we are going to meet now, I must thank her.\u201d said Ye Hai, \u201cIn fact, when I first wrote \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d into the story, it was actually a cameo for this missy, but it became incontrollable, the more I wrote about it\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know this feeling! It is the intoxicated state! I managed to think of the finale for \u201cPure Romance\u201d in such a stateBut, Ye Grand Author, you have deceived me by drawing my Xiao Yu to death in \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d\u2026The pan [2] is on my head again. Many rumors on the internet said that there will be misery, as long as it is my work. Therefore, one must be cautious when reading the deceitful work of mangaka Su!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li complained. That time, Ye Hai was indeed putting too much effort into deceiving the readers, letting her as the illustrator, carry the pan. Till now, many still thought that the \u201cblacklisted\u201d Su Li was the main reason why Xiao Yu had died.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai smiled awkwardly and quickly said \u201cPerhaps this is the resonance between excellent creators like us. Let\u2019s not talk anymore, dinner is on me. You can bring Mengyao and me to the most delicious and high-class restaurant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li thought to herself that this Rosemary was indeed thick-skinned, an oddity who would write Xiao Yu to death with a snap of his fingers. A new, cutie cheater like her was totally out of his league!</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right. Ye Grand Author is definitely a Platinum High God of Qidian, going into the fore without any reservations! Talking about food, I think Lady Zhao should be the expert, she is very fastidious in eating which seems to be a little wastefulBut, I have learned a lot from her. Let\u2019s go to that private restaurant. I think we can still make an appointment, because I always go there with Lady Zhao, and she is rather close to the boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li undoubtedly regarded herself as Zhao Youyue\u2019s toady, willing to become a stooge for the Zhaos. However, a sense of pride could be felt from her speech. Apparently, she enjoyed playing that role</p><br/><p>After all, one should be proud, to able to befriend a member of such a high-class family.</p><br/><p>In this world, not everyone deserved to have Zhao as their surname, not even if they were rich</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Green () here means cuckolded. In Mandarin, the husband of an adulteress is often described by the word (wearing a green-colored hat).</p><br/><p>[2] Pan ()/Carry the Pan () is used in mandarin to refer a person who is left holding the bag. The general meaning is that someone has ended up getting the blame for a bad situation. (ED Note: I didn\u2019t know this, not until I read this TL note, or I would have used the term \u2018scapegoat\u2019. Tell me what you guys think, we can always change it!)</p>\n</div>"}

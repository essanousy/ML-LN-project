With her expressionless face and a reserved look, it somehow projected a feeling whereby everything was fully under her control. Too bad she did not put on a pair of glasses, or else whenever she had finished discussing some important stuff, she could adjust her glasses and muttered words such as \u201cWisdoms of the mortals[1]\u201d. Then, her glasses would shine coldly, and that kind of \u201csuper sage\u201d aura would now appear more vividly around her.</p><br/><p>Of course, in front of Yang Xixi, Xu Jing would be in a different state. Despite having the same expressionless face, in some of the tiny subtle points, it could be seen that she really cared about Yang Xixi. She did not speak out much, however action-wise, she was just like the most loyal and reliable maid who took care of Yang Xixi meticulously.</p><br/><p>Xu Jing wanted Yang Xixi to not leave her forever, she even wanted to replace the position of Yang Ming, the male protagonist in Yang Xixi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>At this time, Li Xiaotong was stunned by Xu Jing\u2019s charisma, and asked her in an unconscious manner, \u201cHelping me out? What did you want to help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without fluctuating, Xu Jing said, \u201cOf course I wanted to help you to gain Yang Ming, so that he would not be snatched by other girls. Didn\u2019t you want to own Yang Ming all by yourself? No matter liking him or not, you already took him up as your own property, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong replied while holding her breath, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Ah Ming and I were childhood friends who played alongside each other and tried to be nice to me. He did what I asked him to do. I could not withstand any other girls taking him away, even if it was his sister Yang Xixi. Anyway, what I wanted to know is that, as a follower of Yang Xixi, why would you want to help me? I don\u2019t really trust you in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to trust me. Based on your intelligence, you should have seen that Yang Ming was such a passive person. For a guy to form a strong bond with a girl, having sex with him is the best way you could have. Wasn\u2019t that your dream to become his first woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you, you, you\u2026 how could you utter such words? Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only tried to analyze this for you rationally. Besides, if you do not want to push him from your side, what do you have in hand to possess him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe if you were unaware of the fact that deep inside Yang Ming\u2019s heart, there is this pampered girl named Liu Sha. If the situation was not taken care of, he might have chosen her at last.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about! I was Ah Ming\u2019s childhood friend since then, how could Liu Sha that whore be on the same par as the relationship between Ah Ming and me, both of our relationship lasted longer than ten years!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong truly did not recognize Liu Sha to be the biggest obstacle, instead, what she worried the most was still Yang Ming\u2019s sister, Yang Xixi, as the bond between theirs in comparison to Yang Ming and hers was much stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were as stupid as a sow. In this world, at least 90 percent of childhood friends would be defeated by those girls fated to get closer relationship with the male protagonist. As his childhood friend, you\u2019d always taken it for granted and seen it as a valuable asset. Who knows if this identity would actually lock you up in despair? If you are not fighting for it, someday you will be eliminated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Jing\u2019s wise words always sounded very convincing. At that moment, Li Xiaotong had felt the latent threats. She had always thought that she could keep this up by time. She could definitely have more initiatives than Yang Xixi and Liu Sha to win over Yang Ming\u2019s heart. Having been brought back by Xu Jing to reality, she finally realized she did not possess the upper hand every single time.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst you could choose to stay with Yang Ming alone in school and kiss him. He would definitely resist that. By then, you could say that you wanted to teach him how to make a good kiss, as every girl loves guys who are good kissers. If he did not want to let down his future girlfriend, then he should learn this, and you are willing to help him to gain experiences. Of course, he would still resist but eventually he would just let it be that way. Worry not about any disturbance from other people. I\u2019ll help you to get rid of any accidental factors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce this step succeeds, it would mean that half of the work has been achieved. Guy\u2019s brains are full of sexual worms, as long as he is addicted to your lips, he would ask for more and through this way, he\u2019ll be fully addicted to you in no time. Obviously, the final battleground was definitely Yang Ming\u2019s house. I will continue to stop Yang Xixi from intruding while you grab your chance to obtain what you have dreamed of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, it is still up to you whether to believe all these words. I am someone who marks my own words, and now it is time for you to work on your own self-realization. \u201d</p><br/><p>From the beginning of the conversation till now, Xu Jing never changed her tone or alternated her way of expressing, and once she finished her sentences, she left while continued studying. Right, even when she was settling her personal issues, Xu Jing still brought along her book to study.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong\u2019s eyes glittered, and she finally made her decision.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>However, in her darkened state now, Xu Jing could not calm herself down. She had listed out those whores who had a close relationship with Yang Ming, then contacted them one by one. By adapting different ways of elaborating, she told them to fight for Yang Ming or to stay in a secured place, as the only shortcut was to have a great sex with him.</p><br/><p>She even came out with a nice plan and helped Yang Ming to schedule his time. In her primary stage, she arranged girls to be introduced to Yang Ming, which truly showed off her powerful skills as a darkened elite scholar.</p><br/><p>The funniest among them was the pampered girl Liu Sha. Liu Sha wanted to know how exactly could she overcome her foxy actions towards Yang Ming whenever she was with him. Despite loving Yang Ming to the max, her mouth would not stop berating him. Sometimes she could even give a slap on his face. But Yang Ming just felt like it was something delightful. Apparently, he was suspected of favoring masochism deep down in his bone.</p><br/><p>Xu Jing told Liu Sha in a calm and rational way that to overcome those cunning actions of hers was very easy \u2013 sex. Sex was the masterclass of all potions. Having sex silently was the best way, and the more postures she used, the more sincere she would seem to be.</p><br/><p>Liu Sha, the pampered girl used her brain of 250 IQ level to think over that. It sounded reasonable to her, but she could not contemplate a way to imminently push herself towards that. Xu Jing actually told her that this was not a big problem. She would prepare a computer device for the both of them so that they would be fully seduced and later on, they would be having sex for real.</p><br/><p>I was Sister Xu in this caste with few words uttered but violent in actions.</p><br/><p>Everything was progressing in accordance with what Xu Jing had scripted. She felt that she should receive some gratitude from Yang Ming who was originally an impotent male protagonist. It was all because of her who cured his impotence. Sooner or later Yang Ming would become the most satisfied male protagonist in the world of Harem manga-s, in which he could release his entire frustrations from all impotent male protagonists in the Harem genre novels. However, his ending would be very dejected, and a new idiom would be created and passed down to the following generations in the world of single persons.</p><br/><p>You laughed at the early death of Brother Ming and Brother Ming would laugh in return to wish you lesser days ahead of life.</p><br/><p>Both Xu Jing or rather Zhao Youyue could help out the mangaka Su Li as Su Li always tried to suppress her full powers and draw only the scenes that brought false hopes to people in order to create tiny chances to some people. These scenes were never her real bullets. But from that onwards, \u201cPure Romance\u201d will become a novel which was written in depths of sex scenes. Of course, with the existence of the holy light, there was no need to worry about whether there would be any scenes which would show private parts. In this way, it would be released to the market as a normal product.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Wisdom of the mortals \u2013 \u201c\u201d is Chu Xuan\u2019s tagline.

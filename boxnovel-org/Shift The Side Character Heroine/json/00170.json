This was even before she had traveled into the story world using the Two Dimensional Gate.</p><br/><p>The plotline was rather calm and straightforward, but it had failed to choose an appropriate timing to blow up. In the sixth issue, Chu Luoxun had appeared, cheerful, bright, and perfect, along with the beautiful description of her musical performance. This had triggered long-suppressed passion and enthusiasm in the students. The readers were able to feel the power of youth coming from these students!</p><br/><p>Sometimes, the best influence would be Amway, since the crowd tended to follow the majority. A lot of netizens would be curious when they see someone discussing somebody else, and they would try their best to investigate and understand that person.</p><br/><p>Hence, the pirated version of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d was spreading fast on the internet. The pirated websites in China would always provide everything for you, to celebrate the spirit of sharing on the internet.</p><br/><p>Many netizens would simply search for the pirated version and read it, since it did not contain many words. Six issues would only have about 50,000 words, so pirates were able to keep up without trouble.</p><br/><p>However, the reading experience on the pirated sites would not always be as satisfying. Sometimes, the text might get left out or missed. After all, it had been mostly hand-typed, and the paragraphs might get mixed up. Besides, there would be pop out windows which prevented the readers from getting fully immersed in the story. Consequently, there would be some bad comments.</p><br/><p>Many pirated readers started to criticize \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d They claimed that it was a story without any climax, and it left them yearning for something it could not deliver. They did not understand what was so good about the novel, to even be able to create a sensation on the internet. They soon denounced it as another business scam, and that its reputation was clearly undeserved.</p><br/><p>These days, pirated readers have become good at waging online battles with fabricated, albeit convincing facts. They would easily outspeak the honest, supportive readers who had spent money to read the originals.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, they would not feel ashamed after reading a pirated novel. To make it worse, they actually thought that they were giving face to the author, as they were willing to spend the time to read the pirated version of his novel. They would even start throwing suggestions on how the authors should write</p><br/><p>They felt like they were the center of the universe, as though the authors would be damned if they had not been there. They should be worshipped by the authors, being treated with equal respect as they would their parents.</p><br/><p>In reality, when it comes to the book comment section of the original website, these people would not be allowed to even post, or comment. It did not matter if their suggestions were good or bad.</p><br/><p>Pirated readers had no right to say anything.</p><br/><p>At a discussion forum called \u201cDragon\u2019s sky,\u201d someone had recommended \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d at the book recommending section. Surprisingly, it had received many good reviews. Many veteran readers who were picky even said that this was the real youth novel. It should be aptly named \u201cInnocent love,\u201d which was the title of an anime. Even though the anime was named \u201cInnocent Love,\u201d the contents were not very innocent.</p><br/><p>These veteran readers had some good qualities in them. Some of them had urged others to buy the real book when it is published. After all, it would feel better to read such a novel on real paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon\u2019s sky\u201d was just a discussion forum on the internet; hence such movements had little momentum. However, the fact that \u201cBeautiful April\u201d had appeared in this forum, goes to show how popular the novel was!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was very happy with the Two Dimensional Gate, this time. The random novel and author she had been sent to were both too good to be true. Her victory was already inevitable.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue also communicated well with the author, Leng Zi. Apparently, the author took her opinions very seriously, so she always tipped her whenever she is free to guarantee how Chu Luoxun\u2019s scenes would unravel in the story. At the same time, she hoped that Leng Zi would write a happy ending for the protagonists so that they could live happily together</p><br/><p>Leng Zi agreed to do so. Zhao Youyue had better faith in female authors, because they kept their promises. Unlike that Ye Hai (Rosemary), who had killed the character \u2013 Yu Shengfan, all of a sudden. He had promised that he would give Little Fish a far larger role, and many more scenes, yet he had killed her off in the story.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s mid-term exams was finally around the corner. This time she was unable to reproduce her glorious achievements from the last monthly exams. The art stream\u2019s papers were easier, and the marking was more lenient. In consequence, the average results of the art students were better. For the science students, things were far more difficult, even moreso than the final-term exam. Even though Zhao Youyue had activated her Xu Jing\u2019s character card, she still faced some trouble.</p><br/><p>Other than Mathematics, the Physics paper even had school tournament questions inside. Zhao Youyue was dazzled by the questions. The top scorers in the class who had joined the tournament were very excited because they have come across similar questions before. They had the advantage over the other students.</p><br/><p>Still, Zhao Youyue used all of her ability to get the second place in the class. The first place was Chen Haoran, who had underperformed during the last exam. This time, his science results were incredible. Against all odds, he was also able to get a full score in maths, a paper that was so notoriously tricky, that only three people in the whole school could earn full scores!</p><br/><p>The number one in the whole school was still Huang Chaozhong. Zhao Youyue fell to ninth place. Still, her name was now acknowledged by all the top students in the school. Apparently, it was not a coincidence that she got first place the last time!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was probably the only one from the top ten who had not joined any competitions. Therefore, she was at a disadvantageous position when the exam had included questions from competitions. Regardless the situation, she still got the ninth place in the whole school, and that was not easy to pull off.</p><br/><p>The person who created the elite scholar group, Kuok Peisheng had been asking around for Zhao Youyue\u2019s QQ ID and added her as a friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Zhao Youyue, I would like to invite you to join the group of elite scholars. They all have the ability to enter renowned universities such as the University of Shoudu, University of Qinghua and we always study together. If you want to join, please accept my invitation, and I will add you to the group.\u201d Kuok Peisheng sent the message to Zhao Youyue with complete sincerity.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had never known that the top elite scholars of the school had a group. The group only had ten to twenty people, and the top ten would always be among them. However, her dark horse appearance had broken the tradition of the group, where they should have monopolized the top ten seats in exams. Hence, she was recognized strongly by the group leader, Kuok Peisheng</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue accepted the invitation because she felt that it would be kind of cool to join this kind of elite scholar group.Whenever she thinks herself as one of the big bosses in the school, she would finally be able to restrain her admiration towards those elite scholars.Other than Huang Chaozhong, she felt no fear towards anybody else, since Xu Jing had her back.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not admire anybody else, but others had started to admire her, the moment she joined the group. They all complimented that she was invincible in art stream subjects, especially her English; which was on another level!</p><br/><p>Huang Chaozhong added Zhao Youyue as a friend, and had even asked her to teach him English</p><br/><p>Huang Chaozhing seemed to be very interested in Zhao Youyue. Perhaps the trauma left by Zhao Youyue last time was still too shocking for him.</p>\n</div>"}

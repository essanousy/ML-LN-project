Whenever her name is mentioned, people would talk about how she was such a schemer, along with her pure and beautiful Lily-love with her sister.</p><br/><p>The moment Olivia became the empress, viewers around the world had cheered in unison. They were in agreement that this highly refined, authentic 3D animated blockbuster was a masterpiece. She was not some virtual character, but a legendary character who was truly alive within another world.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was why \u201cOlivia\u2019s\u201d legendary character card had shown up in the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d She was a genuine iconic character. Soon after, she conquered the literary world, in all sense of the word.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue saw that \u201cRoad to a Female Emperor\u201d was now a leading title. Even so, she still very generously left the copyright of this work open to all. She would seek profit from such work. For her, the more famous, the better.</p><br/><p>She did not even need to promote the work herself. Doujinshi works have already found themselves on the internet. The Lily-line between Olivia and Cirilla was most probably the favorite genre!</p><br/><p>When Olivia finally united the entire continent, Cirilla had transformed from an ugly duckling into a white swan. Her beauty could no longer be described in words!</p><br/><p>The young Cirilla and the current Cirilla seemed to have been illustrated by completely different artists!</p><br/><p>Other than works that featured the two lovely princesses, others were solo appearances of various witchers. It was truly fascinating.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoad to a Female Emperor\u201d was a large-scale epic. Its story covered such a broad world, that Olivia would not always be featured on the screen. The story panned between the perspectives of various significant forces and multiple parties. Contrary to what was expected, these characters had been played out so convincingly that some policy decisions were even more in line to their respective identities. To those rigorous audiences, it was a Godly work among Godly works!</p><br/><p>Perhaps regular audiences would be enthralled by Olivia\u2019s beauty \u2014 how she cheated her way through the world; how she walked her path down the Lily-line. Some of the sharp-eyed viewers came up with highly intriguing interpretations of minute details. This was no CGI, this was actual footage from another world!</p><br/><p>With such elaborate worldbuilding, Doujinshi authors had all the room in the world to work their craft. A particular writer had even written out full-length Doujinshi novel with Geralt the White Wolf as its protagonist. It was well-received. Countless readers urged for faster updates, throwing all their cash at him as if it would help speed things up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had no interest in that money. She would rather have her work gain more fame. If someone could earn his livelihood through it, all the better. If they produced more Doujinshis of her work, would it not gain even more fame? Wasn\u2019t this a win-win matter?</p><br/><p>In fact, after \u201cRoad to a Female Emperor\u201d became the concern of many writers, a particularly reliable game company took notice of it. The company had even intended to purchase its copyrights. After realizing that the game copyright was open to all, the company had been jubilant. It started producing \u201cThe Witcher\u201d game series. This time, its protagonist would be Geralt. Undoubtedly, Olivia would appear in the game as a highly important character.</p><br/><p>When plans for this conscientious game company was announced, almost all RPG lovers became giddy with excitement. This game had all the makings of an absolute masterpiece!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was delighted that \u201cRoad to a Female Emperor.\u201d This work might even be passed down the generations. On the other hand, poorly written works were bound to find the exit on their own.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s latest adventure had been a major success. Zhao Youyue was sure that she had mastered the fabric of those source worlds.</p><br/><p>Source worlds were considered the equivalent of literary worlds, minus the effects on their real-life authors. As long as Zhao Youyue sent ripples across the world, she would still be able to obtain character card. On top of that, it would be a legendary card, something that surpassed even the iconic cards!</p><br/><p>She had missed this great opportunity during her exploits in the previous supernatural source world. She had taken a backseat, passive role, leaving everything to fate, simply recording the events down in a memoir\u2026</p><br/><p>All she had earned from that entry was some energy for the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d Within the second western fantasy source world, she had hijacked the wheel from the figurative driver. As an empress who had crawled her way to the top, she had experienced all form of ordeals, while leaving her imprint on any surface available. She caused a ruckus wherever she went. Eventually, she became the protagonist that the source world deserved!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had squeezed every single ounce of energy possible into the source world. She had even found her true first love. It was Cirilla, who had transformed from an ugly duckling into a white swan\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue would deem this a complete success. She had learned much about the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d \u201cYou reap what you sow\u201d actually made perfect sense here.</p><br/><p>Of all the fun and joy the source world provides, Zhao Youyue found the most fun in combining all the abilities of her wives in one body. Also, writers did not interfere. If she took her time, placing brick by brick, she would eventually attain godhood in these worlds.</p><br/><p>If she were to enter a source world again in future, she would know better now. She should pounce on the opportunity and claim more legendary characters.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue returned to the campus. After much warfare and power struggles on a global scale, the real world now seemed bleak and mundane.</p><br/><p>As Lady Zhao was able to revert to passerby status anytime she wanted to, she did not have to worry about having her privacy intruded. At that moment, she was passionately running her paintbrush across the canvas.</p><br/><p>Her subject was Cirilla in her white swan state. Lady Zhao truly loved this sister of hers.</p></div>\n</div>"}

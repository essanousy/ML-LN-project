But recently there was a newly added female character Lady \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d who possessed a skyrocketing popularity. Since Su Li had no idea about their appearances, she decided to discuss it with Ye Hai before sketching them. Ye Hai\u2019s wife Li Mengyao was afraid that her husband would create a tasteless and weird looking character so she decided to join the discussion as well.</p><br/><p>From Li Mengyao\u2019s perspective, the manga of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d deserves good looking main characters although handsome lads are rare in real-life Esports career, but the manga world should always be better than reality.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Feng had average looks with a slightly plump otaku body in the novel, still his appearance should be extraordinary in the manga!</p><br/><p>Su Li agreed with Li Mengyao\u2019s suggestion as she prioritized appearances as well, thus she would not allow herself to draw any average looking main characters. So, Su Li had turned all the main characters in \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d into ideally handsome looking men with her amazing drawing style.</p><br/><p>Even though Su Li was unfamiliar with creating storylines nor becoming a great mangaka, but her skill of drawing handsome men and beautiful women was exceptionally good. Not to mention, she was one of the best painters out there!</p><br/><p>If her readers ever saw this aesthetic drawing style manga, they would have thought this manga was somewhat related to Boy\u2019s Love, simply because all male characters were so handsome!</p><br/><p>Master Su Li was of course capable of drawing aesthetic manga, as well as harem genre\u2026</p><br/><p>After Su Li posted her latest upcoming project on Weibo, a collaboration with Rosemary\u2019s \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, the comments section was filled with comments from fans \u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking forward to Miss Su Li\u2019s new project, hopefully with a better ending!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan anyone tell me about \u2018The Strongest King\u2019? I seldom read web novels\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s actually the manga version of \u2018The Strongest King\u2019, the novel was awesome! I always stayed up late to read the latest chapter updates!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI strongly recommend \u2018The Strongest King\u2019, the characters are lively and the plot is splendid! Especially the new rich female character, she is absolutely adorable! But most of the players thought that she is a fat ugly otaku, I can\u2019t wait for \u2018Unpleasant Rain\u2019 to expose her true identity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had always thought that \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 was an average manga because of its ordinary plot, but it got so famous due to its unexpected ending, and Miss Su Li\u2019s drawing style is undoubtedly amazing! Of course, her collaboration with Rosemary is definitely a wise choice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRosemary is the goddess in my heart, her creations are great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Rosemary is a female author as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! The beautiful and literary female author Rosemary in Qidian, don\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! A collaboration between two beautiful female authors\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s Weibo post had led to an increase in Rosemary\u2019s popularity, his nicknames in Qidian, \u201cGoddess\u201d and \u201cLiterary Young Girl\u201d were given by his fans to tease him. After it went viral, people had regarded it as a fact instead!</p><br/><p>Rosemary barely made an appearance in the public, thus a lot of readers were unsure of his true gender, not to mention, there was very little proof of him being a male author. Naturally, there were pictures of himself that circulated the internet in which people did not believe, and perhaps, this could only to be blamed on his low profile personality.</p><br/><p>This had prompted \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d to draw even more attention, since beautiful ladies have better chances in comparison to men in this modern era of \u201cgender equality\u201d.</p><br/><p>If any beautiful lady is able to do something special in the male territory, writing a men\u2019s book for instance, she would definitely acquire more resources for advertisement as well as a higher popularity. As for men who write women\u2019s books, no matter how handsome he is, for sure he would be seen differently.</p><br/><p>A fine example would be that females are often praised in men\u2019s outfit, but males are branded as perverts for wearing women\u2019s outfit. As time passes by, more and more youngsters are becoming open-minded, as they would name the guys with female outfits as \u201clady boss\u201d.</p><br/><p>There is a tradition where the readers demand that a male author wears a women\u2019s dress, had he not updated his novel frequently and owed the reader too many chapters; but no one has ever requested a female author to dress up as a guy \u2026</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, this is the gender advantage of a female author, thus \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d had created a sensation before she even began sketching! Ever since she posted the updates on Weibo, Rosemary\u2019s novel had attracted the eyes of thousand.</p><br/><p>Even fujoshis who had never discovered the charm of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was giving this creation a shot, then they were absorbed in it!</p><br/><p>This novel was great because there was no complicated relationship among the characters, only the passion of the main protagonist towards gaming. The main protagonist was eager to return to the prime of his career. Besides, the characters were intelligent and vivid, and there were no complicated plots and storylines. Not to mention, there was no such plot where the resentments in the game were brought back to \u201creality\u201d in the novel, like the hero is killed by a rich man whom he has offended in game. Come on, it is just a game!</p><br/><p>Apart from that, the main protagonist was admired by lots of players in the game as he had the styles and skills of a master, unlike some gaming expert who made enemies wherever she went\u2026 \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was she?</p><br/><p>In order words, Esports novels deserve more popularity!</p><br/><p>It had the potential of becoming an iconic creation!</p><br/><p>Fans of the original novel were quite happy with the news that \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was about to be adapt it into a manga, but worried that Su Li would make a bad influence and cause the manga to end miserably\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, that possibility was diminutive, know that a novel of Esports genre contains no couple relationship. The previous novels of Rosemary have ended nicely due to the absence of female character.</p><br/><p>Unless someone named \u201cZhao Youyue\u201d wanted to cause a scene, perhaps exiting the novel before it ends, then she would contemplate a way to kill the character she controlled, \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d.</p>\n</div>"}

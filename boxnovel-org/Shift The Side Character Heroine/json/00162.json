Due to her frail body, she had missed many of the club\u2019s activities, and was as scarcely seen in school.</p><br/><p>This music club had a QQ group; Chu Luoxun was in the group too. Because of Chu Luoxun\u2019s popularity, many club members were curious about her. After successfully adding her as a friend, they would quickly search for her photos in her QQ space, only to be left utterly in awe!</p><br/><p>She was absolutely gorgeous; her selfies were flawless from every angle! It was unlike some girls who were pretty in reality but lacked the photogenics.</p><br/><p>Her photos went viral in group, and Lin Meiyue saw it too. Of course, she would not get jealous of the beauty of \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d because she was kind-hearted. She was even looking forward to listening to her music, because she had yet to hear anybody left who was unimpressed after hearing her music\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was one lucky girl, for one day; she met her guardian angel.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was on her way returning to the music club room, and right outside the music room was the cherry blossoming scene. She felt a little uneasy because she could not express her feelings to a guy she liked. Both of them had each other\u2019s Wechat ID, but they rarely spoke to each other, and most of the topics they spoke about were pointless.</p><br/><p>This was undoubtedly her first love, and both of them were not aware of their feelings for each other. She simply could not bring herself to ask if the guy she liked felt the same, it was too embarrassing, even to imagine it!</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was an introvert who lacked self-confidence.</p><br/><p>She was returning to the music club room, because she had left her earphones there, and her earphones was her only escape from her nervousness. Whenever she gets nervous, she would put on her earphones, and by adjusting the right volume she could totally leave her surroundings behind and be submerged in her own musical world.</p><br/><p>As she was approaching the music club room, she heard a wonderful ensemble song of a piano and violin. She never heard this song before, so she guessed that it could be an original song.</p><br/><p>The sound of the piano was coming from the other music room, but it was kept locked all the time. All she knew was that they kept a piano there.</p><br/><p>Clearly, the pianist was not as good as the violinist. The piano sounded messy and out of place, as if it was sinking progressively into a deep abyss, and the sound of the violin was like a ray of light, shining down on the abyss, pulling it out from the abyss, like a helping hand.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lin Meiyue found herself enjoying this magical song; she realized this was the song of \u201cCastle in the sky.\u201d Even though \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d has never mentioned about it before, this was most likely an original song created by \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d as the song\u2019s origins could not be traced.</p><br/><p>As Lin Meiyue was enjoying the music, the feeling of unease vanished without a single trace, as if she has been brought to a castle in the sky. She had the God\u2019s eye view of everything from above, everything she saw and heard was turning sharper in contrast\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this the true potential of a master violinist?</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was utterly taken over by this music, and at the same time it got her thinking Was she playing the same instrument as me?</p><br/><p>How can it be so melodious!</p><br/><p>Most of the people who has learned the violin would have the same thought when they hear a top-tier violinist performing in front of them.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was feeling a little bit furious, because the sound of the piano was dragging down the standards of this song, she would have been able to enjoy this song to its fullest without the piano getting in the way.</p><br/><p>But Lin Meiyue could tell that the pianist was not willing to give up, as if he had deluded himself into thinking that he was qualified to play together with the violinist.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Meiyue saw something she could never forget, a beautiful girl with long straight hair was playing the violin, and outside the music club room was the azure sky, where cherry blossom petals had streamed into the room, as the sun gazed upon the whole room and its occupants.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue felt as if this was what she\u2019d been yearning for in her entire life.</p><br/><p>As the song finished, Lin Meiyue\u2019s was still trailing after, reliving that sweet melody, but she caught sight of tears rolling down the cheeks of \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d she appeared to be very sad.</p><br/><p>Why was she tearing up, could her own music have affected her deeply so?</p><br/><p>Was it her attachment to the world?</p><br/><p>Was she taking pity on somebody?</p><br/><p>The girl, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had a pale expression, and she coughed weakly while putting down her instrument wearily. She wiped the tears from her face, and she looked up to see Lin Meiyue who was standing at the entrance.</p><br/><p>At that very moment, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d revealed her contagiously bright smile, and she introduced herself to Lin Meiyue while shaking her hands vigorously\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue doubted herself for seeing the wrong image, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was obviously a girl full of positive energy, she loved to smile and enjoy herself, to be crestfallen was not to be \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d or Zhao Youyue, felt that this Lin Meiyue was awfully familiar, Lin Meiyue had a shoulder length black silky hair, she looked good and cute.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue did not think too much about it; she was piloting \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d to proceed with the plot. She gave the girl a few tickets to her music competition because they seemed to get along pretty well, and even boldly asked for Chen Hao\u2019s contact number. She hoped that Lin Meiyue could pass this entry ticket to Chen Hao, because she had a crush on him.</p><br/><p>In this \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d Chen Hao was the best friend of the main hero, he was an elite scholar in science subjects, and he refused to get into a relationship at an early age. He was a quiet and handsome boy, a male version of \u201cXu Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue liked this character setting too, because she could make \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d fall madly in love with Chen Hao, so that the main heroine would not get jealous of her.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue could never save Gu Yuan\u2019s music career, and she could never play music together with him, and she could never replace \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d. \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had to do this herself, as a friend, and the main hero would just be her friend too.</p><br/><p>Chen Hao was the best friend of Gu Yuan, so that gave her all the more reason to approach Gu Yuan, it was certainly sensible of her to do so.</p><br/><p>This made Lin Meiyue speechless, how could she so easily let others know who her crush was? The cheerful, optimistic and generous personality of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d overwhelmed her, and she agreed to help.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she realized that she could give this entry ticket to another person. Naturally, that person was Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>The assist king \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had temporarily left the stage.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue and Gu Yuan soon bumped into each other afterward; there was no one left in the school because everybody else had gone home, this school did not provide any dorms for the students to live in.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan saw Lin Meiyue with her earphones plugged in and carrying her violin in her bag out from the music club room. His eyes blinked, and he felt an impulse to ask Lin Meiyue in a stuttering manner, \u201cDid you just come out from the music club room?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue nodded her head while feeling slightly confused\u2026</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan thought that it was Lin Meiyue who had played the song together with him, which made him fall in love, almost instantly.</p>\n</div>"}

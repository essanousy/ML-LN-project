The longer she knew Zhao Youyue, the more she understood that Lady Zhao\u2019s identity was not that simple afterall.</p><br/><p>When He Weiwei returned to her dormitory, she coincidentally heard her classmate Zhong Xiaoli \u2013 from the dormitory to the opposite of hers, talking loudly about the Zhao Youyue rumors. Fate had given her the hearing to pick that up. Fate had given Zhong Xiaoli the ability to milk and splice rumors. It was people like Zhong Xiaoli that was why the rumors spread at an increasing rate on each passing day.</p><br/><p>Zhong Xiaoli was basically announcing to her room, \u201cZhao Youyue next door is really misbehaving. Classes have not even begun, and she is already causing trouble during military training. This is a disgrace to our Chinese Studies. I\u2019m now starting to doubt how she got in here. With that beauty, it doesn\u2019t take much to imagine. A trade must have been made.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Dan, who was Zhong Xiaoli\u2019s roommate, quickly joined in to remain on her good side \u2014\u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Zhao Youyue looks just like a vase. What talents could a vase possibly have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Dan scoffed. She considered herself to be delicate, pretty and temperamental. If Zhao Youyue did not have her immunity against the sun, she would not have been able to stand out like so. Liu Dan even considered her own beauty to be on par with Zhao Youyue\u2019s.</p><br/><p>It was true that girls relied heavily on their beauty. But reputation did not trail far behind that, regarding priority. Reputation gave you the headroom to be pretentious. The greater the reputation, the more you deserved to be pretentious. To become the \u201cwidely recognized school flower,\u201d one had to rely on reputation. If not, you could have the beauty of the heavens, but no one would know of it. That beauty would be pointless.</p><br/><p>He Weiwei heard the girls next door gossiping unscrupulously. The blood rushed up her head. She marched to their door, and like a great general, she stood with her legs straight and apart, reprimanding those girls for those unfounded accusations. She went on saying how the mighty Zhao Youyue had a powerful, wealthy family.</p><br/><p>In retuen, Zhong Xiaoli replied flatly, \u201cBeautiful girls have their ways, it only depends on how little moral they\u2019ve retained. Well, they could spread their legs open and cash would flow in, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Weiwei was a loyal, protective friend. She almost erupted at those words. She dashed forward and swung her hand back to give that whelp a massive slap. Fortunately, her roommate Yu Xuefei just happened to return. She grabbed hold of the enraged He Weiwei and started dragging her back to their dormitory\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei may not exactly be on good terms with He Weiwei, but they were dorm mates. Yu Xuefei also looked up to Zhao Youyue, and knew what kind of person that Lady really was. Naturally, she did not buy those rumors one bit. Sadly she was not as protective as He Weiwei, so she would not go around slapping everyone who spoke of the rumor.</p><br/><p>Also, she did not want to get into unnecessary trouble. Even if a female student started a physical fight, that would qualify as a breach of campus rules. During this military training period, discipline was particularly strict. Yu Xuefei did not want her roommate to cause trouble and get the entire dormitory punished.</p><br/><p>It was true that she did not like He Weiwei, but they have been living together for over ten days. Zhao Youyue no longer slept in the dormitory. Zhou Cai gamed pretty much the entire day. It was only inevitable that left without a choice, these two would start conversing. They may still bicker and disagree on everything, but some bonding had occurred.</p><br/><p>The \u201cno discord, no concord\u201d theory was not only applicable to boys, but it was relevant to girls as well. No matter what, she was not the unbearable presence of the room\u2026</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, such a presence did exist in the dormitory next door. Her name was Ma Shuang. Her name carried the meaning \u201chighly efficient.\u201d She was anything but that, to the extent that people have given up on criticizing her.</p><br/><p>This was a hot and sweaty time of the year, but she rarely ever took baths. She was not even bothered to wash her legs. The whole room was filled with that amazing fragrance. At that moment, Yu Xuefei had successfully dragged He Weiwei back to the doorway. Both girls took a whiff of the stench and frantically started to flee.</p><br/><p>Compared to the environment of the dormitory next door, their own residence was simply heaven. Whenever Zhao Youyue dropped by in the afternoon, she would take the initiative to clean the place up. She had even discussed with her roommates on how to redesign their dormitory, giving it some class and value.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was most certainly a strange girl. She seldom stayed in the dormitory, yet she intended to build the dormitory up into a \u201cheavenly dormitory\u201d \u2013 the kind that would appear amazing in digital pictures on Weibo and social media\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s bed would never possibly house a speck of dust. She had done such a tremendously convincing, superficial job. How could a perfectionist like her overlook anything?</p><br/><p>After the training, Zhao Youyue would swap out the blankets and bedsheets. She found them to be incompatible with her aesthetics. They would ruin her vision for the dormitory.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. There\u2019s poison in this dormitory!\u201d Yu Xuefei cried out, giving He Weiwei a final tug towards their own dormitory. That single line transferred all the hatred from He Weiwei to Yu Xuefei.</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei was very concerned about her public impression. It also meant that she was really talented at offending others. She did not have any major problems \u2013 rather, she was riddled with numerous minor flaws. The \u201cPrincess syndrome\u201d would be one of them.</p><br/><p>Zhong Xiaoli and Liudan were both embarrassed and furious. Both of them transferred their hatred towards the absent Ma Shuang. They had been most unlucky to be grouped with a slovenly roommate like Ma Shuang.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they were not the kind of people who dared confront their roommate face to face. The most they could do was to satisfy themselves in mutual hatred for the third party. Eventually, they got used to the situation\u2026</p><br/><p>This was just like the man who got locked up in a stinking toilet, and when he was finally released, he would look at everyone pinching their noses and ask, \u201cWhat smell?\u201d The smell that blasted them in their exhausted faces whenever they returned to their dormitory was awfully enjoyable.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of me! Didn\u2019t you hear their nonsense? Zhao Youyue simply went home in her family\u2019s car, but here they are, spinning tales out of nowhere. What the hell is this?\u201d He Weiwei fumed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was saving you from trouble! Besides, Lady Zhao has such a mighty background, how could mere rumors ruffle her hair? Growing up until now, I, Yu Xuefei have never once looked up to anyone. But I truly admire Zhao Youyue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only know how to blabber. Why don\u2019t you follow through with some action? If you\u2019re that good, prove it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t show, I only blabber.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I\u2019m not doing this with you again\u2026 Have you found any clubs?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu Xuefei heard what He Weiwei asked, she suddenly became excited. She said, \u201cOf course! I picked the Student Council. I chose the Health Department! I won\u2019t pursue some crazy position that only exists in our dreams like the Student President. If I start somewhere early in my first year, I might just become a department head before graduating, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei now understood that this top university was nothing like her little, rural high school. There were way too many incredible entities around here. It had humbled, sobered her up, and she had set her sights on a more realistic ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHealth Department? Then you\u2019ll have to take good care of that freaking room. You said it yourself just now. There\u2019s poison in their dormitory!\u201d said He Weiwei, breaking out in laughter. What unlucky neighbors. They had encountered an ultra-rare presence that was only spoken in whispers over the internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat smell almost knocked me out. Fortunately, all of us here have kept the dormitory clean\u2026\u201d said Yu Xuefei, still nauseated even after long leaving that foul place.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Initially, she wanted to AMWAY it to Zhao Youyue, but she did not do so as she knew her taste well.</p><br/><p>As it was, Zhao Youyue was a rather unpredictable reader. She would read anything, whether it was a web novel or a hard copy novel, a famous work or even a magazine sold at the stall. Of course, she would read it in softcopy, on her phone.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, the functions of the smartphone are comparable to computers. One can easily obtain limitless knowledge, as long as it is connected to the internet.</p><br/><p>Since Zhao Youyue loved to play with the phone so much, she must have obtained knowledge that is unknown to her peers. Her wealth of knowledge could originate from Duanziwang, as well as Zhihu, and Douban.</p><br/><p>It would be easy to find a topic to chat with her, no matter who you are.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue has once said that she was not fond of juvenile novels, because they were all basically the same. They all seemed to portray the joy of innocent youth, but, it would be good if they could be accurate for once</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, the plots and the characters in most juvenile works were abnormal, as if they had been based on the youth from other worlds.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing worried that the \u201cBeautiful April\u201d would be criticized by Zhao Youyue, if she recommends it to her. The progression of the romance had been agonizingly slow; it was as if the book \u201cwanted you to die out of impatience.\u201d After all, the male protagonist and the heroine were both very shy individuals.</p><br/><p>If Miss Zhao criticizes it, Jiang Qing would have no idea on how to oppose her. However, what Jiang Qing had never thought of, was Lady Zhao voluntarily picking up \u201cBeautiful April\u201d!</p><br/><p>Since then, the both of them had always discussed the plot progression of \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Jiang Qing was in the fan club of Lin Meiyue, of course. Wait, no, there were no divisions formed yet, during that time. All of the readers supported the male protagonist and the heroine, and their interaction with each other had caused the teenage girl dreams of the readers to explode, allowing them to happily eat the dog food.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing was pleased that she could support this couple with Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>The happiest thing about reading a book would be to meet a like-minded friend, and both had agreed on the development of the plots which gave rise to hours of lengthy, cheerful banter on a mutual topic. Their friendship had strengthened, because of a book.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, Jiang Qing\u2019s stance was shaken as \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 made more appearances. She often told Zhao Youyue \u2013 \u201cChu Luoxun must have fallen for Gu Yuan, right? I think she matches him the mostLin Meiyue is quite annoying that she likes to fuss over small matters, she is such a small-minded person.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Qing perceived Zhao Youyue as a diehard fan of Lin Meiyue. Such abominable heresy!</p><br/><p>This was what Zhao Youyue answered her most of the time \u2013 \u201cChu Luoxun is helping him only in music, and she even has to go through Lin Meiyue to contact Gu Yuan. Meanwhile, she has not done anything secretly to steal Gu Yuan, and she does not get jealous because of him. So, how would it be possible for her to have any feelings for him? You\u2019re reading too much into it. She is merely a side character, mainly there to assist Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue. Lin Meiyue is very cute, don\u2019t you see. She gets jealous often, because she really cares about Gu Yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was the one who played the role of \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 and she knew that the reason Goddess Chu saw Gu Yuan in a different light was mostly due to his musical talent. She had embarked on her own journey of music after she had been influenced by his music when she was little. This bomb would only be uncovered by the end of the story.</p><br/><p>Fans of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 guessed that she had deeply fallen for him as she had assisted him so many times. In reality, this was due to what he did in her past, without even being aware of it.</p><br/><p>She had always been side character A and, now, she saw Gu Yuan as friend A.</p><br/><p>The reason Jiang Qing was longing for \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was that she wanted to become a girl like her, one who would always walk hand in hand with laughter. Her jovial personality did not only restrict her influence to her universe, she had brought many wonderful reading experiences to the three dimensional readers as well.</p><br/><p>Whenever she reads something about \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 she could not resist smiling and even bursting into laughter. \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was really funny. Moreover, she truly enjoyed reading the description of her performance. The words used were wonderful, better than a full mark essay.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing recalled that there was a nickname for this work \u2013 \u201cApril is your full marks essay,\u201d and she could not find any description more apt than that.</p><br/><p>Apart from the extremely confident personality of \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 Jiang Qing admired at her musical talent too, as she liked singing. However, she did not know how to compose, write lyrics, or play all sorts of musical instrument, while \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was proficient at all of them.</p><br/><p>In summary, Jiang Qing Little Angel had been utterly charmed by \u2018Chu Luoxun.\u2019 She could not stop herself from repeatedly reading the apparances of the Goddess Chu. It was her life\u2019s dessert!</p><br/><p>The Goddess Chu was not only a beauty, but a joker too!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, \u201cMengya\u201d would not hire a high standard illustrator, or else, it would be awesome, as one would be able to visually enjoy the charm of the Goddess Chu.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing, who seldom used Weibo did not know that there was a passionate Great Mangaka who had taken the initiative to illustrate \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 and had posted it on own Weibo, just a few days ago and had even tagged Qidian\u2019s famous Godly Tycoon readers and[Youyue] tycoon, the owner of the trending book list. Those actions were just like that of a bootlicker who was seeking for rewards and credits</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. This passionate Great Mangaka who had illustrated the character for free was Su Li.</p><br/><p>She truly suited the role of an illustrator more, as she was not good at screenwriting, yet, she was skilled at illustrating beautiful characters.</p><br/><p>Su Li knew that Missy Zhao was obsessed with \u201cApril.\u201d Moreover, the work itself was getting more popular, stirring up intense response from the readers, being ranked first in the reader survey form of \u201cMengya\u201d almost every time. Its influence had also radiated to the internet.</p><br/><p>An idea had come to Su Li, who liked to keep up with the times, and she illustrated \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 playing the violin in an elegant dress, with a similarly gorgeous background!</p><br/><p>This was a high-quality illustration.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Su Li had read up till the latest update, and she favored \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 the most. Thus, she had allocated some of her time to draw this exquisite illustration, to please Miss Zhao, as well as to increase the followers of her Weibo by becoming a trendy figure.</p><br/><p>It turned out to be very effective!</p><br/><p>The illustration was well received!</p><br/><p>Many fans of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 instantly became Su Li\u2019s follower, saying that they liked her so much, and have finally found the perfect picture of the imagined Goddess Chu!</p><br/><p>Her exquisite painting and beautiful style showed that she was an illustrator among all illustrators!</p><br/><p>The Great Mangaka Su now flourished, thanks to the calculated maneuvering of an experienced illustrator!</p><br/><p>Of course, at that moment, the latest issue of \u201cMengya\u201d had not been published yet</p>\n</div>"}

The entire time, she acted like the almighty God who had been closely watching Zhang Yanwei.</p><br/><p>However, she was absolutely tactful and selective, deliberately elaborating on the key details only at the very end to unravel the suspense. She had created a smokescreen to mislead the readers into believing that Zhang Yanwei was evil. They hated so much that they wanted her dead, or its author.</p><br/><p>This was the greatness that every passionate author could achieve, controlling and twisting the storyline, while leaving a clue in every city for future use. When the readers finally backtrack, they would realize that the clue had always been there. Hence, they could not complain about being cheated or lied to. They even praised Master PhD\u2019s ingenuity and supreme planning. Nobody could ever forget such an iconic character who has sacrificed so much for humanity!</p><br/><p>In the last one hundred thousand words, the first fifty thousand words had been a bleach for morals. It served to psychologically prepare them for the fact that the heinous \u201ctraitor\u201d Zhang Yanwei was not as bad as everybody thought. She was accumulating strength in the dark, and she was actually making use of the new intellectual races, such as the sea people and the winged clans. It might seem as if she had been working for them, the truth was that she had used them as protection as she pursued the truth at the same time. In fact, she was proud of her human identity, and firmly believed that humanity was the absolute master race!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yanwei was actually working on the re-emergence of human beings, while also developing viruses that could be used against other intelligent races. Obviously, this had not been in her original research, but she had placed her personal interest aside and complete the counterattack. To gain the trust of these intelligent races, she committed acts of insanity, leading the readers to believe in her \u201cevil crazy scientist\u201d image. Such an image had stretched deep and taken root in several readers\u2019 minds. Please die, and die soon, please!</p><br/><p>In the last fifty thousand words, Master PhD\u2019s plot thickened, before the novel finally ended in a deafening silent cliffhanger. Such writing would undoubtedly give readers second thoughts. When the suspense was finally lifted, the fish scales would drop off their eyes!</p><br/><p>The biggest reveal, of course, was the true identity of the \u201creborn\u201d of Zhang Yanwei. Arguably the largest revelation was why Zhang Yanwei seemed to always have a plan for any situation. It may seem less justified at the time, but after that, readers would learn just how prescient she was!</p><br/><p>Again, it explained why she was almost completely right in the direction of her research. The only flaw was how un-innovative she was. She was merely repeating experiments to verify something she knew for a long time.</p><br/><p>When her identity as a \u201creincarnated\u201d was finally revealed, memories of her past prior to her reincarnation was presented to the readers. Readers looked into the experience of her last life or Zhang Yanwei in another dimension. Almost every reader was impressed by it!</p><br/><p>Master PhD did not write about her experience in any was that was sentimental, but in cold, and precise words, including Zhang Yanwei\u2019s inner monologue.</p><br/><p>Before her reincarnation, Zhang Yanwei was also a very talented scientist. Apparently, she did everything for humanity, no matter how difficult. She would never sway from the principles of her first life!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yanwei was proud of herself as a human being. She felt that humanity was the greatest species in the world. Not knowing that a higher alien civilization was controlling the current alien species on earth, and that their technology was inherited from that of human beings. Otherwise, it would have taken them ages to develop technology comparable to human beings.</p><br/><p>So Zhang Yanwei always thought that the intelligent races were just thieves. They were poor creatures who became pawns of some higher civilizations. There was nothing natural about that meteor shower. It was a planned, manufactured biological weapon. It only allowed the evolution of all living things other than human beings. It was premeditated. How could she not see this through?</p><br/><p>If Zhang Yanwei was just any regular brilliant scientist, she would have been killed off in no time at all. In a human society that has been torn up from top to bottom, even top scientists like her had little influence, and all her research would end up in smoke.</p><br/><p>In the later stages of the story, she had almost given everything up for the greater good. Only her pride and dignity kept her going. No matter how ugly the situation was, she never gave up on humanity. Even if human society was corrupted and turned into a barbaric community, even if the earth became completely uninhabitable, she still believed that human beings would one day rise above the ashes!</p><br/><p>But she never got to see the day. Human society devolved into a broken-up community where the size of fists spoke the loudest. Under such circumstances, she became useless, and she was quickly abandoned after being infected by some illness. In the end, she met a horrifying giant scarab. A mutated cockroach that devoured her whole!</p><br/><p>Even under such circumstances, she never hated the humanity. She firmly believed that most people still had the basic qualities of sincerity, kindness, and beauty. For the sake of survival, moral would have to take a temporary back seat.</p><br/><p>After her reincarnation, she began to correct the world with her own actions, and no one could stop her, not even the Endless Squad that had not appeared before her rebirth.</p><br/><p>She chose to save humanity in her own way, even if she would never be considered its savior, but the mad scientist who saw no value in human life. She did not care about her name. Even if people would only remember her crazy evil side, forever unaware of her sacrifice and hard work. All she wanted was human beings to dominate the world again!</p><br/><p>Zheng Yi believed that his \u201cEndless squad\u201d of justice had to stop her. In the end, they succeeded in vanquishing evil. Justice will prevail!</p><br/><p>The ending left readers staring at blank walls for long periods of time. Master PhD was just too good at this!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

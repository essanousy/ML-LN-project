Although he was an author of light novels, he did not want to see his sister ending up as an otaku..</p><br/><p>From his work, \u201cMy Sister Is Just So Cute,\u201d his ideal sister was the perfect all-powerful, proud, confident, and somehow narcissistic sister. Perhaps he thought that his introverted otaku sister, Yuan Shawu was too easy a target.</p><br/><p>He would rather have his sister bully others than have her be bullied by others. Even if she was despicable and difficult to deal with, it would only please him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong, the elder brother, had thought it all out for his younger sister. Society did not take kindly to otakus. The internet and food services were so well-developed now, that otakus could stay in their rooms for all eternity. People would despise those otakus if only they knew how hopeless the otakus were.</p><br/><p>Other than otakus, people also despised older people who stayed single. Why would they not find a partner if they were healthy?</p><br/><p>No matter how happy you were to remain single, you can\u2019t stop the secular bias of the world. Maybe it was the hidden power of the human race that drives us to reproduce. If everyone believed that being single would be happier, wouldn\u2019t the human race be extinct?</p><br/><p>Therefore, once humans can be reproduced artificially, those older people would no longer feel the pressure of the world. If you do not want any offsprings, you no longer have to worry about human extinction while going about with your single life. You could even participate in some assessment to adopt a child issued by the government.</p><br/><p>Yuan Shawu was satisfied with her brother, other than the fact that he had been born a boy, not a girl. She had thought that Yuan Zhengzong was the abusive or perverted brother. After all, he was bringing girls straight to his home. But now, it appeared that Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s was a naive, gullible gentleman. There was nothing that he could not do when it involved serving a girl.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong backed off on Qiu Yuting. His mind was simple. Perhaps he always believed that there was no need to be careful with pretty faces; he even wished that every pretty girl would live happily and harmoniously.</p><br/><p>As a gentleman that would do anything for a girl, Yuan Shawu, or rather, Lady Zhao, would treat him appropriately. As mean as she was, she was not an evil person. Yuan Zhengzong was too kind to be treated badly.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong was like a manga classroom protagonist. Most readers who knew his story-style disliked him, yet they could not hate a good gentleman. As long as he did not become Itou Makoto and remained an asexual gentleman, nobody could hate him. There were people like him in reality, hence readers did not have to imagine much about him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Shawu further pleased her loving good brother. She actually helped her brother to prepare their dinner \u2026</p><br/><p>With Xu Jing\u2019s ability to do housework and cook, Yuan Shawu did not make cooking any harder for her brother. Instead, his brother was content with her performance. Finally, his sister has changed, she even found her great talent in cooking!</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong was indeed a simple-minded man. He did not even find this profound change one bit weird. He had accepted the new sister in front of him, just like that.</p><br/><p>Only Qiu Yuting, the plagiarist was impressed!</p><br/><p>From what she recalled, Yuan Shawu had always been a useless sister. (she did not know that Yuan Shawu later became his brother\u2019s illustrator, a well-kept secret.) Anyway, Qiu Yuting felt absolutely superior in front of Yuan Shawu. She had thought she was better than this useless sister in every way.</p><br/><p>However, she soon found Yuan Shawu to be a highly proficient cook, while she knew next to nothing about it. She could almost feel her face burning with jealousy!</p><br/><p>At least she had to be far better than Yuan Shawu in music, right!</p><br/><p>Her innate musical abilities may not be spectacular, but she had an entire library of iconic music from the future to draw reference from. It would be impossible for Yuan Shawu to be better than her, the reborn!</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting acted immediately. She switched on her mobile phone and copied a popular song in the future, \u201cthe Promise of Autumn.\u201d[1] It was a song performed by a young goddess in the future. According to the timeline, that would be three years later.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting\u2019s mind was filled with future songs that were not easy to master. She could care less about classical music. In her opinion, classical music was too complex to comprehend. It was destined to be eventually expelled from society\u2026</p><br/><p>It would be ridiculous to expect a high school student to comprehend musical literacy, especially like Qiu Yuting, who had inadvertently entered the entertainment world. She was not a composer in her previous life; she could not even write the notes of a song properly on musical sheets. Maybe she could hire a professional musician to listen to her song and draft a musical sheet of it for her.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, several reincarnated Plagiarists did the same thing. It was impossible for her to take the song down, note for not, so she could only sing songs for the professionals to record. Hence, she would never earn respect from musical professionals. These professionals could not believe that an illiterate could ever compose anything addictive and impressive. To save themselves from shame, most reincarnated would imply that they had heard from some unknown source. As for the thick-faced like Qiu Yuting, this was her musical gift!</p><br/><p>One who could not even tell the difference between treble and bass was boasting about her musical talent. Was her face made of concrete\u2026?</p><br/><p>Still, Qiu Yuting words were strong. Nobody would even fathom that she was a reincarnated. Even if they knew that she had copied it from the future, what right did they have to condemn her \u201cmusical talent\u201d?</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] The Promise of Autumn() was derived from \u201cYue Ding\u201d(Promise) () by Where Chou. It was sold more than five hundred thousand copy and being named \u201cthe four young goddesses\u201d along with three other artists.</p></div>\n</div>"}

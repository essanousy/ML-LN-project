How popular is it, among other doujins?\u201d Zhao Youyue casually asked.</p><br/><p>When Su Li heard the name, she gritted her teeth and frowned, \u201cA garbage game! I don\u2019t see the point of remaking it at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Judging by the tone of Su Li, Zhao Youyue could already guess that the creator of this game was on the same or even higher level than this 18+ Demoness. The international comic convention happened twice a year, and Su Li could always get the perfect spot for her booth, so she should be no stranger to Lady ZUN and her \u201cDreamside Maroon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Zhao Youyue realized that Su Li lacked the ability to create her own stories with skill. Forcing her to play a game like \u201cDreamside Maroon\u201d which required deliberate setting, worldbuilding, and storytelling, would torment her to death!</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s most incredible ability would be her imaginative mind and fantasies while drawing sex scenes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the game was garbage and boring, its related doujin works are really popular in the doujin field, because there are no copyright issue. Many of the game characters are quite attractive and popular.\u201d Su Li lightened her tone and complimented the game to her best. She held back her grudge against \u201cDreamside Maroon\u201d because of Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat lady ZUN, do you know her?\u201d Zhao Youyue asked her out of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, she and I are irreconcilable!\u201d Su Li said it firmly.</p><br/><p>This made Zhao Youyue even more curious; she hoped Su Li would share her past history with Lady ZUN.</p><br/><p>Su Li have no intention of hiding it, so she told Zhao Youyue everything. The name of lady ZUN was Zhu Yinzhu, an awkward-sounding name; she had entered the field of doujin at almost the same time as Su Li. But Zhu Yinzhu had made an announcement when she first entered the doujin field; she wanted to make a revolutionary change in the doujin circle!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yinzhu even said that 18+ doujins were not actual doujin works, they were just ugly, vulgar displays of weak fantasy. She would use her actions to tell the world, what real doujin was!</p><br/><p>So, Zhu Yinzhu had created the game \u201cDreamside Maroon.\u201d Even though it was just a game, it had provided gamers the options of world setting and character designing. Allowing those doujin creators to make use of her intellectual property and create something of their own was its purpose.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, the ideals of Zhu Yinzhu and her dissatisfaction towards 18+ doujins was the reason why she had butted heads with Su Li, who was drawing 18+ doujins to earn a living.</p><br/><p>Su Li was once rather close to Zhu Yinzhu, where she learned that Zhu Yinzhu was an arrogant person. She was friendly on the outside, but she actually loved alcohol like an old geezer. She was always seen wearing lolita\u2019s clothing, wrapping her long slim legs up with a pair of black of leotards.</p><br/><p>Anyone who had seen lady ZUN before would call her the Doujin Goddess\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Doujin Goddess!? She never earned any money in the field of doujin, my split identity, \u201cWang Li\u201d earned a lot more than her, I hate such idealists!\u201d Su Li concluded.</p><br/><p>Su Li would not say that she was jealous of Zhu Yinzhu because she couldn\u2019t care less about profiteering, while Su Li could only use the lowly desire of men to earn money.</p><br/><p>After hearing the explanation from Su Li, Zhao Youyue was even more interested in lady ZUN; she loved idealists.</p><br/><p>Finally, Zhao Youyue requested help from Su Li to draw an illustration for the character, \u201cAltair.\u201d She would even pay a good price for it.</p><br/><p>Su Li hesitated for a moment, but not because of the unlucky curse that falls onto any character she draws. She just did not want to increase the popularity of \u201cDreamside Maroon,\u201d because the character design of \u201cAltair\u201d had originated from the character, \u201cShirotsumekusa,\u201d while \u201cShirotsumekusa\u201d was one of the game characters in \u201cDreamside Maroon.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Lady Zhao was her best friend; and she would not turn her down. Even though she said that she would do it for free, she knew that Lady Zhao would still pay her the money.</p><br/><p>This was the same as accepting a deal for some fast cash.</p><br/><p>With the power of money, Su Li had set aside her prejudice towards lady ZUN; she even considered drawing the 18+ doujin of \u201cDreamside Maroon.\u201d As the game was growing more popular in the field of doujins, she could earn even more if she draws its erotic doujin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had told Su Li of the doujin novel of \u201cDreamside Maroon\u201d and the author\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had even asked if Su Li knew of an author who called herself \u201cSetsuna,\u201d and naturally, Su Li knew nothing about it. There were tons of authors in the field of doujin, who would know of an author with little to no fame?</p><br/><p>Obviously, Zhao Youyue agreed that Su Li was right; this was the least popular literary work that she had ever entered. Even the failed movie \u201cWar Heroes\u201d was much more popular than this.</p><br/><p>Su Li would always give her best when fulfilling Zhao Youyue\u2019s requests, so she started to read that doujin novel when she reached home. She was looking forward reading it, as she thought she had a similar taste to Lady Zhao\u2026</p><br/><p>But, after reading a few thousand words, Su Li had lost all the desire to continue reading, what was this rubbish doujin novel!?</p><br/><p>At first, Su Li wanted to read through this literary work to satisfy Lady Zhao. But she could not understand anything from this doujin novel!</p><br/><p>When faced with such a predicament, to draw an accurate illustration, she would have to communicate with the original author herself, or else she would never do it justice.</p><br/><p>Although Su Li was not good at creating original content and screenwriting, her ability to draw manga and illustration was outstanding. As long as Su Li is able to work with an excellent original author, her work would surely gain fame.</p><br/><p>Without any leads, Su Li had no choice but to contact Zhao Youyue, asking her to communicate with the original author.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue was not able to help either; she very much wanted to contact the doujin author, \u201cSetsuna\u201d as well. She decided to contact her after Su Li finishes drawing the character\u2019s illustration, she would post the illustration on the forum.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had a temporary solution up her sleeves, she told everything about \u201cAltair\u201d to Su Li, from her appearance to her surroundings, and taking \u201cShirotsumekusa,\u201d who already has existing character art as a reference to draw \u201cAltair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Su Li was able to start drawing. She was amazed that Zhao Youyue had a unique taste in reading, where does she find the patience to read such a terrible doujin novel?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The past would remain the past. Right now, Olivia was his \u201cdaughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Olivia and Cirilla\u2019s settling down at Kaer Morhen, Olivia seemed to have regained her tsundere personality. Her antics even successfully drew laughter out of Geralt and Vesemir.It would not be a stretch to say that Olivia\u2019s presence had filled the cold Kaer Morhen with laughter and warmth.</p><br/><p>There was a type of individual in this world. They were those with the natural talent of leadership. Without any tangible reason, people crowded around them, as if drawn by something inexplicable.Olivia was such a person. As she grew older, so did her charisma.</p><br/><p>That was why Geralt would still send an invitation to Triss, regardless of him knowing that Olivia\u2019s old teacher was Vilgefortz. He hoped that Triss would come by Kaer Morhen and provide both Cirilla and Olivia her guidance.</p><br/><p>Even Yennefer was considered. However, she was far harsher and colder, so her meeting may have to wait.</p><br/><p>That being said, Geralt also thought that Triss was far more outgoing. She goofed about a little too much \u2013 leading others to forget that she was a figure of legends.</p><br/><p>This was why she could be found in Gwent decks as an indestructible hero card, with a battle power of 7. She was quoted on the card as, \u201cI can take care of myself, trust me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many would think that she required protection, but the reality was only the opposite.</p><br/><p>Triss Merigold was a talented and beautiful sorceress from Maribor. Along with Keira Metz, she had volunteered to be a royal advisor for King Foltest of Temeria.</p><br/><p>This would make her the Northern Realms\u2019 court mage. Temeria was a vast country of the Northern Realms and its king, Foltest was a talented man, believed to be the only one who can stand against His Imperial Majesty Emhyr var Emreis. By extension, this made her quite the powerful figure.</p><br/><p>In Gwent, Foltest was the leading card for the Northern Realms deck.</p><br/><p>Triss\u2019s knowledge, skills, and loyalty had brought her positive remarks. With her aqua blue eyes, a face filled with freckles and her beauty mole on the bottom corner of her mouth, along with her firey red hair, she strode over the world like it was her stage. These were now her trademark characteristics.</p><br/><p>She specialized in healing magic and alchemy, and often brought along many potions regarding magic or alchemy. Among her accessories was a silver fortune talisman with a blue gem on it.</p><br/><p>She was friends with the female sorceress Yennefer and her lover Geralt. She was also the lover of her friend\u2019s lover, which made things interesting.</p><br/><p>Triss had participated in the Battle of Sodden Hill with Yennefer, rebelling against the great lord, and was even mistaken to have died in the battle, along with 13 other sorcerers who had their names carved on the obelisk.</p><br/><p>In reality, she had teleported herself to her hiding base after being badly wounded, in a tower located in Maribor, losing the hair which many identified her by. She later recovered thanks to magic and spells, regaining her original beauty. She was then given the title \u201cThe 14th of the Hill,\u201d not as an obituary, but as a title to celebrate her fortune for being able to survive. She later laid the foundations of her seat on the conference table of King Foltest at Temeria.</p><br/><p>Geralt told Cirilla and Olivia that the one and only Triss Merigold would tutor them.</p><br/><p>Cirilla did not react much, as she was already content with her peaceful, blessed life. She did not need any more strangers suddenly being added to the roster. Still, Cirilla was slightly interested in having a sorceress teach her. It still led her down the path to power.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Olivia knew that this Triss might end up as her \u201cnursing mother,\u201d since Triss has had feelings for Geralt for some time now.</p><br/><p>The quick-witted Olivia decided that she would not be as dull, like her \u201cnursing father\u201d who had not prepared anything for Triss. He actually had the audacity to ask her for a favor \u2013 free of charge.</p><br/><p>It should be noted that Triss had a stable and well-paying, respectable job at Temeria as a court mage. She had just completed a task for the nation, and Geralt wanted her to toss aside everything and travel such a distance for something as simple as tutoring?</p><br/><p>Even if true love was involved, Olivia would never let her Wolf Daddy be such a trashy person. She hoped that she could gather many talented sorceresses to her side. Sorcery was the highest grade of skillsets possible at that time being.</p><br/><p>That night, Olivia revealed that she intended to hold a welcome party for Triss Merigold, and she also hoped that Kaer Morhen would undergo a major change.</p><br/><p>Was Kaer Morhen that chilly?</p><br/><p>Well, they could easily bring in some warmth with the usage of magic, creating a geothermal system. That can\u2019t be too difficult.</p><br/><p>Olivia could always draw from her knowledge of modern technology. Adding magic to the mixture could lead to the creation of many magical tools.</p><br/><p>Sadly, these tools would never be mass-produced. Olivia would have to synthesize the tools all by her own, so in a way, they were \u201chandmade.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, this was enough for her to about change to Kaer Morhen, little by little. It wasn\u2019t as difficult as one might think. With the help of some alchemy, Olivia would be able to transform its interiors, little by little, along with the support of others.</p><br/><p>These superhuman witchers were bad with their hands. They did shoddy craftwork, and were sloppy at cleaning up.</p><br/><p>At that moment, all the way in Temeria, Triss received the invitation that Geralt had sent. Due to her feelings for the White Wolf, she accepted the invitation in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cTriss, are you out of your mind? It\u2019s winter. Kaer Morhen could hardly serve as a shelter for you, if the gale does not blow it down first! Are you sure you want to go there?\u201d asked Keira Metz, a fellow court mage.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Geralt is there!\u201d Triss replied with a smile.</p></div>\n</div>"}

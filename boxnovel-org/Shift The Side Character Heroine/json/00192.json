They were happier, especially after knowing that one had to book this restaurant several days prior, feeling an overwhelming sensation of superiority with every bite.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai had intended to invite Lady Zhao to this dinner. But, Su Li knew that Zhao Youyue, as a high school student, had to go to school today.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Lady Zhao is still a high school student? Are all high school students today as rich as she is?\u201d Ye Hai was shocked.</p><br/><p>Li Mengyao then added \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be improper to tip so much for Ah Hai\u2019s book at her age? Wouldn\u2019t she be scolded by her parents? Already spending so recklessly without any income\u201d</p><br/><p>For Li Mengyao, it was improper for a child to spend recklessly, even if his family is wealthy. She certainly would not teach this to her child. It was like cultivating a rich playboy. Soon or later, the Zhaos are going to be damned!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Su Li felt a tad bit guilty about it. She had always gladly accepted Lady Zhao\u2019s tipping without pondering over it. After all, she was so rich</p><br/><p>Since they talked about it now, she began to feel that it was improper of her, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s advice her tomorrow to not recklessly spend the money, if she had not earned it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hai nodded his head gently, thinking that Su Li was a person with integrity, she was not a materialistic person, after all.</p><br/><p>Unlike creators, some live streamers would do whatever they could to deceive the audiences for a present, even if they are innocent kids.</p><br/><p>There were also some oddities among the audiences who had less thought processes than a child who were able to defalcate millions of public funds to tip live streamers. What was wrong with their minds</p><br/><p>Creators like Ye Hai and Su Li were earning money from the support of the readers, not depending on the tips from Godly Tycoons. Even so, they were not short of tips. However, an enormous tip would will stimulate them and create big headlines to attract the eyes of the public, allowing more readers to notice their works.</p><br/><p>For them, that kind of tip was an honor to receive. For instance, a web novel of Qidian would have the ability to be pretentious by achieving a Silver Sect Master, while those that gained Golden Sect Masterswere even greater. However, Golden Sect Masters were mostly fabricated by the High God Authors.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the Golden Sect Master gained by Ye Hai'\u201dThe Strongest King\u201d was genuine. This had naturally astonished the other authors and the readers.</p><br/><p>After all, the fabricated ones were hardly any secret. For example, a Supreme God once created a \u201cOne Hundred Million Sect Master\u201d which meant that somebody had tipped 10 Golden Sect Masters for a book that worth one million RMB, which was one hundred million Qidian coins. That was impossible!</p><br/><p>However, outsiders would not understand it. Moreover, the media was busy reporting it, sensationalizing that book and its author which further cemented the author\u2019s status in the industry</p><br/><p>Even a super Godly Tycoon like Zhao Hao would be unable to tip such an amount at once. Although he loved to spend his money on the streaming platform and web games, he spent it in moderation.</p><br/><p>This plot would only exist in a novel, and it would be an illogical one. In reality, it could happen at a live auction or charity event\u2026but, tipping a web novel?</p><br/><p>That would be a joke!</p><br/><p>Friday passed, just like that. Ye Hai and his wife checked-in a four-star hotel which was already excellent in itself.</p><br/><p>Soon, it was Saturday. The weather was fine on that day. The temperature was pleasant, as it was already the end of May.</p><br/><p>Using the GPS, Ye Hai and his wife went to the business club. There, he was mesmerized by the place and said to his wife \u201cLooks like the well-being of this Douyu Streamer \u201cAh Yu\u201d is extraordinary. The exterior of this place already looks exclusive. I am now starting to think that \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d has indeed transmigrated into this world, and that she is even the daughter of a legendary super plutocrat.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to it, Li Mengyao tittered and said \u201cWhat are you going to do, if it is real? You want to fall in love with the character that you created as a creator?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hai\u2019s facial expression changed and he immediately refuted \u201cHoney, you are joking again. If this is real, she would be my daughter. Am I a person who would pull off an Oni Chichi [1]?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa-ha. I bet you would forget about it when you are intoxicated. I got it now. You were not obsessed with typing away, at that time, you were obsessed with \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! I was earnestly typing to earn a living, not obsessing about my female character!\u201d Ye Hai denied firmly. Actually, his wife was correct. He was abnormal that time.</p><br/><p>By this time, Han Leng should be experiencing what Ye Hai had gone through. He no longer cared about Zhao Youyue, the first girl who he had fallen for ever since being obsessed with \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d thinking that the former was incomparable to \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d especially when it comes to playing the violin.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, Zhao Youyue had taken the grading test under the arrangement of her teacher, Liu Yuxi. She would soon take part in a musical competition, just like \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d but on the provincial level.</p><br/><p>Getting good results at the provincial level was necessary for her to be qualified for the national level.</p><br/><p>Liu Yuxi had suggested that she become a \u201cHuman Metronome\u201d while competing in such competitions, to be emotionless and only pursue precision and technique. She knew that Zhao Youyue had a state of mind that was suitable for emotionless performance. Therefore, it should be easy for her to win a prize, as her foundation and skills were solid now. She really had put a lot of effort when it came to the violin!</p><br/><p>Then, Su Li arrived. She always used Didi Dache [2] as she did not have a car. Her arrival had saved Ye Hai from awkwardness, and she eagerly asked \u201cWhat kind of person do you think \u201cAh Yu\u201d is? She has not sent any photos. She wouldn\u2019t be ugly, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she would be particularly beautifulmainly because she never turns on the camera when streaming. She would have done so if she is pretty, that could have easily made her famous.\u201d Ye Hai speculated, which sounded reasonable.</p><br/><p>At this time, Lady Zhao\u2019s private car was slowly approaching</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1]Oni chichi () literally translated to as Naughty Father is a Japanese adult video game where the male protagonist commits incest with his two step-daughters.

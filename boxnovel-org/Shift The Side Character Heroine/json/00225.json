As he was fond of animes, games, and novels, he had subscribed to the live stream channel. When he saw her playing a certain song requested by the audience, it had struck him like no other!</p><br/><p>Now, he intended to try this himself!</p><br/><p>Under the influence of \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d he decided to play his own style for this upcoming music competition final. He never yearned for any fame; he just wanted to influence the audience, as long as one person was listening to him, he would continue to play his music!</p><br/><p>This was what he had learned from Goddess Chu!</p><br/><p>At that very moment, Hang Yongming ignored every single judge and started to play his own anime theme song\u2026</p><br/><p>When he started to play \u201caLIEz,\u201d most of the judges were astonished, what on earth was he playing?</p><br/><p>There were a few younger judges among them, and they knew of \u201caLIEz.\u201d But this was the last place they would expect to hear it!</p><br/><p>Even though it was ridiculous, but it was surprisingly amusing\u2026</p><br/><p>One of the young judges thought that this rendition was pretty impressive, but he did not hesitate to put a zero on the score sheet.</p><br/><p>Although it was a self-picked song, in fact, there were not many songs for them to pick from, most of them were classical pieces, not some anime adaptation. How could the old judges rate the song, if they have not even heard the song before?</p><br/><p>Art competitions are quite flexible and free-spirited, but it would become a nightmare if it was up to the audience to judge in a music competition, there would be no standards at all!</p><br/><p>As it turned out, it would be best to judge, based on the skills and accuracy.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had ultimately shown her skill, and she managed to capture the hearts of the judges, there was no doubt that she would get an excellent score.</p><br/><p>Just as Hang Yongming started to play \u201caLIEz,\u201d Han Leng was lost in thoughts. When he came to his senses, he was impressed by this violinist who stood out from the rest. What an interesting guy, daring to pull a stunt like this in a music competition!</p><br/><p>Han Leng felt that the level of capriciousness Hang Yongming showed was the same as Chu Luoxun, but his music level was not at that level. He only thought that this song as acceptable as it was catchy, but it was far from influencing him.</p><br/><p>A young audience like Han Leng only thought that \u201caLIEz\u201d was just an interesting song, and there was no need to ask for the reaction of the audience who were older.</p><br/><p>When Hang Yongming finished his performance, the crowd did not cheer for him as he had expected, he was greeted by crickets and poker faces.</p><br/><p>Most of the audience did not know of the song \u201caLIEz,\u201d they only felt that the song was interesting after hearing it, surely, it was different from the others, but it was a rather short piece, that would be all the credit he could take\u2026</p><br/><p>The biggest mistake Hang Yongming did was, not knowing that Chu Luoxun had a main protagonist\u2019s halo on top of her head too, and that she was protected by a mysterious aura.</p><br/><p>Just like a delicious food literary work, where the dishes they make would glow and be seasoned with dramatic killer moves\u2026 In a literary music world, the main characters would have a different effect on their music, as if they could make the audience indulge entirely in their music!</p><br/><p>Perhaps in reality, the readers would think the music was just average while reading the novel, but the audience in that literary world would get addicted to it, just by listening to the music!</p><br/><p>Reality was not a novel, and unless Hang Yongming has a \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d he would never manifest those mysterious powers from the novel in reality, never being able to perform with such magical effects.</p><br/><p>Of course, the audience would not be bothered by the lack of logic behind the music, they would only think that the musician was so great that they send them into another world, making the music so surreal that images would pop up in their brains, or even stimulate certain parts of their brains to make them happy! What an incredible music performer!</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming left the stage with disappointment; he felt the harsh reality slapping him in the face\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, he was actually missing the moment of glory he had in the school, where even though the effect of playing the violin in the school hall was not that great, at least everyone would give him a round of applause after he has played a song everyone was familiar with\u2026</p><br/><p>But now, all he got were the angry faces of the judges and the poker face of the bemused audience.</p><br/><p>Just when Hang Yongming had given up all hope, he heard a soothing voice, \u201cThat was an interesting performance, I never actually expected you to do that in a competition, I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming lifts up his head and saw Zhao Youyue with her gorgeous gown, her flawless, beautiful face, and a sincere smile.</p><br/><p>He had to concur, her smile was pretty, and her voice had a special healing property.</p><br/><p>But what gave Hang Yongming a deep impression was her expression on stage, she was as cold as steel during her performance, and her poker face gave her the impression of a strong, heartless person.</p><br/><p>It was as if she was sitting on top of the clouds, looking down upon the mortals.</p><br/><p>How did she change her expression so quickly, which was the real her? How terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you mocking me? The judges didn\u2019t acknowledge my music, and I did not get the expected reaction from the crowd.\u201d Hang Yongming said it in an impolite manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I not one of your audience? I think you did pretty well, but on the wrong occasion.\u201d Zhao Youyue smiled at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, quit it. We\u2019re different, and we will never be the same! You\u2019ll never understand what real music is!\u201d As Hang Yongming glanced upon that flawless smile of Zhao Youyue, he turned his back and left. He knew that he would not get any trophies at all, this was all his choice.</p><br/><p>When the competition finally ended, the results came right in. Zhao Youyue had gotten her wish by winning the gold medal of this provincial music competition!</p><br/><p>She had no regrets!</p>\n</div>"}

There were two reasons, she liked this book from the bottom of her heart so she felt awesome while reading it. The other reason was to watch over this book, so that it would not crumble suddenly. She certainly would not want to see the usage period of \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card\u201d to reduce due to a decrease in character popularity.</p><br/><p>She realized that whether maximum gaming talents or language talents were rather useful to her. She would not have to worry about her English teacher anymore. As for language essays, she did not even need to apply the template of one main accompanied by three sub-points.</p><br/><p>It was previously mentioned that the essay she composed could amaze the teachers like Han Leng\u2019s, or maybe even better than him! Overall, her writing style was however sharp and invective. She would get decent marks if it suited the taste of the teacher, or else she would get mistaken as a child with a psychological problem because of her choice of words\u2026</p><br/><p>In fact, the character \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was deprived of love, leading her to become an abusive, talkative person and addicted to gaming, she emitted a vibe of a cynical person.</p><br/><p>Whenever Zhao Youyue activated her \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card\u201d, she would assimilate the tremendous loneliness of the character. Perhaps she really has serious mental problems, because she seems to be venting her stress all the time no matter what she is doing.</p><br/><p>In fact, the difference of character personality between Zhao Youyue and Yu Shengfan was pretty obvious. Zhao Youyue was born in a happy family, her parents loved her although sometimes they were obnoxious for showing too much love for each other. Ever since Zhao Youyue cooked them a dinner, they made a self-reflection upon themselves, thinking that they had left out their daughter too frequently</p><br/><p>Ever since that dinner, Zhao Youyue\u2019s parents decided to eat together once a week with Zhao Youyue\u2019s homemade meal in order to improve their family relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Shengfan\u201d had never experienced such a heart-warming family, the only place where she felt that sensation was when she was causing troubles with Lin Feng and Tang Yongkai in game. She could feel their earnestness, it was unlike the cold treatment she gained at home.</p><br/><p>Compared to the \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card\u201d, Zhao Youyue liked the \u201cXu Jing\u2019s card\u201d better because she would be calm and clear-minded after activating it. Then she could study passionately. Zhao Youyue would always have that satisfaction after deactivating \u201cXu Jing\u2019s card\u201d. Immersing herself in studies was such a great thing</p><br/><p>Anyway, with Zhao Youyue\u2019s side character trait and saint mentality, she would not have to worry about the side effects of using a character card. The \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card\u201d was useful to her too, she was no longer bad in gaming and she did not have to worry about dragging her teammates down anymore, only others would drag her down. Yeah, this was the confidence of a gaming expert!</p><br/><p>In the recent chapters, Rosemary\u2019s writing was rather ominous, as if he was hiding something. There was not much about Yu Shengfan, but some minor details, insinuating that there was something wrong with Lady Yu Shengfan.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue was a little disappointed as she wanted to see more Yu Shengfan\u2019s scenes and how Rosemary would portray her differently without her possession. Besides that awkward Mary Sue-like appearance (of course, it was corrected by Rosemary, she became a low profile rich lady like Lady Zhao), anything happened to Yu Shengfan later was being written under Zhao Youyue\u2019s possession.</p><br/><p>Perhaps she would discover something interesting while comparing the character before and after her possession.</p><br/><p>Of course, adding more scenes of Yu Shengfan could also secure Yu Shengfan\u2019s popularity. She was not the only one who wanted that, the comment section of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was full of such doubts \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Rosemary, your recent updates are short and sluggish, why didn\u2019t Xiao Yu appear anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA plot progression without Xiao Yu, I\u2019m dying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanna see the interaction between Xiao Yu and Hoodlum Tang, this pair of clowns are amusing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Xiao Yu supposed to join Lin Feng already? I can\u2019t understand why are you dragging it\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t continue reading if this continues. You can update the story more often even without Xiao Yu appearing in it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Zhao Youyue could no longer wait for it, so she contacted Rosemary, she wrote a message, \u201cMaster Rosemary, what\u2019s wrong with you recently? Not in the mood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not realize that her earlier exit had caused so much effect on Rosemary, and she certainly did not expect that Rosemary would be fallen in love with the female character Yu Shengfan.</p><br/><p>After receiving the message from Lady Youyue, Rosemary felt a little bit of a migraine. There were a lot of readers who cared and sent their regards, including some cute fujoshi readers. They were really rich because they often tipped some Sect Masters without much hesitation. \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d might become the first book with \u201ca thousand Sect Master\u201d in Qidian.</p><br/><p>Rosemary would not pay too much attention to the normal readers, he had always replied them simply. But Lady Youyue was different. Don\u2019t forget she also held the Golden Sect Master account \u201cI\u2019mYouyue\u2019sBrother\u201d. After joining the \u201cLone Elderly Club\u201d, Zhao Youyue had once flaunted the 8 million Q coins in this super tycoon account, prompting everyone to worship her like a God. They were eager to know Zhao Youyue personally, in hope that she would tip them a Silver Sect Master that worthed a million Q coins</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had clarified that Zhao Hao was not her brother but her cousin. This mysterious young master certainly left a deep impression towards the people since his Golden Sect Master triggered a fuss in Qidian.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, unlike Zhao Youyue, he was not interested to mingle with the authors. In fact, if it was not because of the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d, Zhao Youyue would not join the circle of authors as well. Zhao Youyue herself could actually write her own book if she activated her \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card\u201d, but she still felt that being a reader was the best. This is because most of the authors would take her opinion seriously and treat her like a special guest because of her wealthiness.</p><br/><p>Rosemary could ignore readers and even Sect Masters because he had already more than ten Sect Masters, but he could not just ignore the silver and Golden Sect Master Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>He had no choice but to reply, \u201cI\u2019m doing fine actually, I will get back in shape in no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, he had decided to eliminate the highly popular Yu Shengfan!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Can you write more about Xiao Yu? I am actually fond of her because I had empathized with her, not to mention that she was the cameo I requested. I did not expect that you would write her stories better and better, and even make her the first female support character. I\u2019m honored.\u201d Zhao Youyue said.</p><br/><p>After reading this message from Lady Youyue, cold sweat was chilling down Ye Hai\u2019s spine, who just realized that he was about to \u201ckill\u201d this Silver and Golden Sect Master Lady Youyue</p><br/><p>He was struggling in despair, but what else could he do?</p>\n</div>"}

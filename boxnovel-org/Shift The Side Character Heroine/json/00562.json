She would play your heart like a fiddle, just like chefs who made light-emitting cuisine. Goddess Chu had forced the listeners into memory lane, whether they wanted to or not. The music did not come from her. It came from their souls, and she had merely shoved them through the doorway!</p><br/><p>Not even the instructors from both companies were exempt from this nostalgic sorrow. They were flung, decades back to days where they were once naive, immature and shallow. Instructor Ma seemed to have been struck harder than the others, as his impressive deskmates were all males!</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he have that one female deskmate back in grade school?</p><br/><p>Since junior high, not once was he placed beside a girl. He was actually pleased about that, as he considered having a female deskmate to be troublesome. You could never strike up a proper conversation with a girl, and any Freudian slip might end up stepping on their toes!</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not talk about high schools. Teachers generally prevented opposite genders form mixing, unless it was a special case. Some teachers needed some elite scholars to guide the weakest links in class. Han Leng happened to be one-half of such a pairing.</p><br/><p>Of course, an elite scholar like Zhao Youyue only brought more harm than good. She would drag her deskmate along to have all sort of crazy fun. Study? Hah, study, my ass!</p><br/><p>Instructor Ma felt tears streaming down his cheeks. Why did I not get myself a female deskmate? I had been so pleased with it at that time. Why was I so stupid?</p><br/><p>He was not the only one currently lost in those long-repressed thoughts. Oh, how did they suddenly have the unquenchable urge to immediately call up their old deskmates and talk about those good old days. This soul music by Goddess Chu was comparable to aphrodisiac-laced cuisine. The results were highly potent\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Leng had basically fallen down into this memory pool with his arms wide open, back first. He had surrendered himself to the music he knew so well. Resisting would only make it hurt even more. His true deskmate was not actually Zhao Youyue, but Chen Haoran \u2013 who had gone to the capital to study at Chung Hua University. He was Han Leng\u2019s blood brother. They have constantly kept in touch, but that man would not stop bugging Han Leng about his younger sister\u2026</p><br/><p>Since when did Han Leng have a sister? Please, for the love of God, move on. Forget about Leng Zi. A genuine, straight man like Chen Haoran should not be offering his soul to Lucifer\u2026</p><br/><p>His memories with his deskmate Chen Haoran were warm, but his old days as Lady Zhao\u2019s deskmate were almost just as memorable. It was the time Han Leng underwent his extreme makeover, courtesy of Lady Zhao. She turned acne-infested, awkward him into a dashing, young and gorgeous writer. If not, how could he possibly have experienced such great sales by being the poster boy of his publishing company?</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao often took his heartstrings and wrapped them around her finger like cocoon silk, but she had been a truly loyal friend. She was not as petty as girls in general. Sometimes, Han Leng considered Lady Zhao the ideal friend. If they ever got into a romantic relationship, that admiration towards Lady Zhao might have slowly turned into disgust.</p><br/><p>This was not some sort of joke to scare you readers. There is a certain type of girl in this world. Getting into a love relationship with them would only give both parties agony. These girls would be too independent for their own good. They would not be concerned about the feelings of their male partners. Sadly, love involves a great deal of compromise and accommodation. Both parties have to give and take to make a relationship work.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao only seemed to be gentle and highly tolerant towards females. When it came to males, she would automatically switch to her \u201cloyal best brothers\u201d mode. This probably had something to do with the fact that her soul contained the fusion of some male energy. She did not process thoughts like others.</p><br/><p>There was nobody that Lady Zhao loved more than herself. Her \u201cwifes\u201d were different \u201cselves\u201d of her. Guys probably wished to have a sweetheart who would rely on them when it came to just about everything. It granted them a sense of accomplishment, and they would take care of their girls more diligently than before, just like their younger sisters.</p><br/><p>At times, Lady Zhao would pretend to be a younger sister type, just to trigger those younger sister complex guys. She was a world-class actress\u2026</p><br/><p>She actually wished to adopt such a younger sister, herself\u2026</p><br/><p>Her song ended. Hundreds of listeners lingered in the deep aftertaste, before finding the way out of their souls. When they finally came to their senses and turned to Zhao Youyue who stood in the moonlight, hugging a guitar, their faces yearned for more, begged for more!</p><br/><p>She was simply superb, far too superb!</p><br/><p>She most definitely deserved to stand on stage with the world\u2019s best. The whoever it was who was boasting about shamelessly just minutes ago should just bug off. Invincible singing? Hah! You aren\u2019t even worthy of carrying Zhao Youyue\u2019s shoes!</p><br/><p>Indeed, Wang Yin was crushed in all aspects. He wanted to scream there and then, that he was actually Zhao Youyue\u2019s fan\u2026</p><br/><p>And so, gone were the bullshit rumors that ranged from Zhao Youyue being a talentless vase to those that claimed her to be an actual prostitute. Her guitar playing and singing skills were enough for her to be a private music teacher. Ah, wait \u2013 she could totally be a live streamer!</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026 Female live streamer?</p><br/><p>Most of the students had visited Ah Yu\u2019s live broadcast room before. They were suddenly struck by an overpowering sense of familiarity. Her music had reached out, tore through her passerby aura, and extracted memories of Ah Yu from these blinded fools\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhong Xiaoli and Liu Dan had never once seen any of Ah Yu\u2019s streams. They seldom watched live streams, to begin with. Even so, this did not stop them from admiring Zhao Youyue. Liu Dan considered herself to be cute and beautiful, she believed that she was on par with Zhao Youyue\u2019s in terms of charm. Even so, she was totally stunned. How could there be such a beautiful and talented girl in this world? She was cheating, she was hacking. How could regular players keep up?</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Youyue, encore, encore!\u201d Several listeners have suddenly been poisoned. Instantly, they lost their minds and morphed into her crazy fans. They were just like those foodie guests who ripped off their clothes in an orgasmic state after ingesting aphrodisiac-laced cuisine.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, or rather, Goddess Chu would never bear to refuse her fans\u2019 requests. She sang another two folk songs. Both were classical songs that only in this parallel world.</p><br/><p>In the end, Zhao Youyue switched off the character card and ended her performance. If not, according to Goddess Chu\u2019s style, she could have sung all night long\u2026</p><br/><p>Thanks to the hacker Zhao Youyue, her company decisively earned the victory. At one point, other companies actually came over to join the concert. The first unforgettable memory of Uni-life was thus created for many on that day.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Zhao Youyue could no longer conceal her identity.</p><br/><p>With this revelation, those pesky little rumors were quickly reduced to great jokes of the century!</p></div>\n</div>"}

Similarly, mangakas will lose themselves if they went too far in their artworks. In most cases, conditions like this would either give rise to some everlasting classics, or lead to some rotten opuses.</p><br/><p>Thus, editors play an important role to monitor the quality of works from aside.</p><br/><p>Anyway Su Li\u2019s editor, Wei Suo did not plan to interfere with her written plots. Instead, he was impressed with Su Li\u2019s touching scenes, and fully supported the plots. To think that a hero from Harem manga would turn from a herbivorous man to a bulldozer[1]. Incredible! That defied the perpetual convention of Harem manga!</p><br/><p>To him, the Yuri plots between Yang Xixi and Xu Jing were the biggest highlight of the entire novel. Not only they had enriched the erotic scenes, but they had achieved a whole new level of arts that could render the audience restlessly. Besides, the character of \u201cXu Jing\u201d was much more colorful now. She had outwardly obtained Yang Xixi. But in fact, she was still a tragedy of love, how pathetic. In Yang Xixi\u2019s heart, there was no one besides her brother.</p><br/><p>As for now, judging from the plot development, it might be difficult to conclude the story later. But Wei Suo paid no heed to this. In his eyes, with the darkening of \u201cXu Jing\u2019s\u201d character, and the moral degeneration of Yang Ming, not only the interest level of \u201cPure Romance\u201d had skyrocketed, but the manga\u2019s popularity was exploding!</p><br/><p>From the reader\u2019s feedback in a survey, \u201cPure Romance\u201d had deservedly become the No.1 manga on \u201cWind Manga\u201d. Meanwhile on Qidian manga website, the rankings of \u201cPure Romance\u201d in all Top Clicks Chart, Recommendation Tickets Ranking, and Monthly Tickets Ranking were gradually rising too. The momentum was as good as that of \u201cSlay the Gods, Seek the Truth[2]\u201d. It had enticed more and more readers, and all of them were always waiting anxiously for the manga updates!</p><br/><p>A grand occasion like this had again blown the minds of numerous veterans in the manga industry!</p><br/><p>It could not be helped. By rights, a Harem manga like \u201cPure Romance\u201d that depends solely on body-touching scenes, did not stand a chance to go onstage. Never had anyone thought that, owing to the character of \u201cXu Jing\u201d, the later plot was becoming more and more amusing. Hmm, it seems that the manga had broken free from its own shackle and emerged as a godly artwork, hadn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>There is actually a comparable example amongst the webnovels. It is none other than the \u201cRoad to the Buddha\u201d written by \u201cDream of God Tactics\u201d, a prominent Qidian platinum author. In any way, the beginning of its story sounds exactly like a second-class novel of spiritual-cultivation theme. Besides the main character\u2019s unfaltering way of killing people, the plots and the character moldings were unremarkable. Such a novel would most likely end up to be an ordinary piece of hollow literature[3]. As time goes by, it would be replaced by another hollow literature.</p><br/><p>Unbelievably, just as the hero in this book stepped into the divine realm, the story settings and plots turned \u201cgodly\u201d at once. The popularity shot up as well. At last, the book had even achieved an ultimate state where \u201conce the Buddha\u2019s book is out, the rest in this world are no longer books\u201d. It had also founded the Antiquity fashion[4], prompting \u201cDream of God Tactics\u201d to become a God of Novel with only a single book release!</p><br/><p>Perhaps there are other underlying reasons too. Don\u2019t forget, there is a regrettable character in \u201cRoad to the Buddha\u201d. She is Dragon Lady Aoluan, who had been devoted to the hero Zhou Qing all the way. But in the end, she still perished before the eyes of Zhou Qing by stabbing herself with a sword. The final sentence in the novel \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Qing knew very well, that he could no longer see the heroic and valiant girl who wielded a sword in his memories. If he could, that would be five billion and six hundred million years later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigh, the ending of Dragon Lady Aoluan was heartbreaking! She was no doubt the female character that was most engraved within the reader\u2019s mind in this popular Antiquity-fashion webnovel. Not to mention, no other characters had suffered such a misfortune like hers. When the book \u201cRoad to the Buddha\u201d was mentioned, one could easily remember this sentimental female character. You can say that the superior fame of this book did not really come from the character moldings, instead, it was out of the magnificent story settings and plots.</p><br/><p>Akin to \u201cRoad to the Buddha\u201d having all sorts of indispensable foreshadowings prior to the appearance of divine realm, the preceding chapters of \u201cPure Romance\u201d were full of mundane Harem plots too. If not, how will the coming chapters strike those readers like a thunderbolt?</p><br/><p>At first, the main character of \u201cPure Romance\u201d, Yang Ming had been undergoing a typical storyline like any other Harem heroes. But now, he suddenly conceded to his lust, regaining his men\u2019s nature to think with their penis. Sure enough, the readers had enjoyed those scenes to their heart\u2019s content. Looking back to the other Harem novels, they would feel their main characters were all hypocrites! So boring\u2026\u2026 How could the grazing romance be comparable to shooting the real bullets[5], Ahh\u2026</p><br/><p>After the later plot of \u201cPure Romance\u201d unfolded, a catastrophe had befallen the other bland Harem mangas. In a sense, it had become an overt sabotage of the other businesses!</p><br/><p>Humph, blame no one. Why couldn\u2019t the other Harem mangas just come up with a character like \u201cXu Jing\u201d too?</p><br/><p>Due to the ceasing increase in the popularity of \u201cPure Romance\u201d, for sure the magazines and websites would not interfere with Su li\u2019s composition. After all, their priority was none other than the sales volume. As long as the abusive contents, such as ladies\u2019 nipples were not shown, it would be considered a normal manga!</p><br/><p>At this moment, no one could stop Su Li who was carried away by her success!</p><br/><p>Readers?</p><br/><p>What is that? I\u2019m your daddy!</p><br/><p>Just wait for my updates, how dare you hold an opinion against your father?</p><br/><p>Wanna change my storyline? In your dreams!</p><br/><p>Exactly. Su Li had been so carried away. Just like the hero in her manga who did everything as he pleased, she was now following her feelings utterly. As for those promises she had made to her readers, go fly a cat! To her, these are all meaningless shackles now. What she wanted was to become a superior mangaka who composed a superior iconic novel!</p><br/><p>Thus to trap even more readers, she was brainwashing them in her reader group and Weibo blog \u2014</p><br/><p>Worry not everyone, you\u2019ll all be happy with the ending of my masterpiece. It\u2019s gonna be a pleasant one. Of course, for a benevolent mangaka like me, would I even cheat my readers? My children? I\u2019m your daddy! Like always, there are only children who cheat their fathers, but no fathers who cheat their children!</p><br/><p>Not only that. Since \u201cPure Romance\u201d earned her fame and reputation, she was invited to appear on several television shows. At long last, she revealed her identity of a female mangaka. During the shows, she naturally put her hand on her chest, rashly pledging that she would give everyone a satisfying ending.</p><br/><p>All of these occasions had pushed the popularity of \u201cPure Romance\u201d to a level beyond imagination!</p><br/><p>In this situation, Su Li had finally written up to the most crucial part of the entire novel. The evil deeds of the hero was finally revealed! His car was about to overturn[6]!</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] Bulldozer () refers to a promiscuous guy who pushes all the girls, as in having sex with them.</p><br/><p>[2] Slay the God, Seek the Truth () is a popular Chinese webnovel.</p><br/><p>[3] Hollow literature () refers to a written work with trivial contents and unrefined storyline.</p><br/><p>[4] Antiquity fashion () is a style of Chinese novels that is based on the ancient Chinese background settings and terminologies of iconic novels such as \u201cInvestiture of the Gods ()\u201d and \u201cJourney to the West ()\u201d.

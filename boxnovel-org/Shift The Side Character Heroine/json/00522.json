Instead of feeling exhausted, she somehow felt more energetic than usual.</p><br/><p>She was merely a top scholar. Her only sports-related credentials had been ill-gotten through her mini four-wheel-drive racer\u2019s card.</p><br/><p>Things were different now. She exercised on a daily basis. She was truly pursuing the path of the sword. Her body was highly-conditioned now, opening a new world for her to conquer \u2013 the world of sports.</p><br/><p>Her tailormade Jane Doe Su cape and blindfold arrived by post. She picked them up purposefully, like a superhero surveying his first ever completed work outfit. Now, she could start her journey as a swordswoman with \u201cJane Doe Su\u2019s\u201d card.</p><br/><p>She had contracted Hu Xiaotian\u2019s ailment \u2013 the one that provided the inexplicable curiosity that asked questions like: How does a human skull react to a chance meeting with a long, hard object like a baseball bat, or a cane? Such meetings had almost no place in the modern society. Weapons had grown far more sophisticated and intangible, such as power and wealth.</p><br/><p>If things too</p><br/><p>k a turn for the worst, she could still make use of her influential identity as Zhao Youyue and solve the crisis at hand. Of course, it would take a lot before that happens.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Zhao Youyue would not be deterred from the path of the sword. It may no longer be as relevant as it was in another era, but it would find its purpose when the Two-Dimensional Gate takes her to more worlds. Bodyguards were useful, but guarding oneself\u2019s body was the more immediate and self-dependent option.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Zhao Youyue\u2019s sword dance looked more like a classical form of dance. Nobody would assume that it was capable of taking lives. It also had an ultimate skill \u2013 \u201cFairy from Wonderland.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue reached home, \u201cTale of Wuxia 3: Swords of the Future\u201d was experiencing the peak of its popularity. Physical merchandise was selling like hotcakes. Various characters from the roster became centerpieces of the industry, including the notorious Yan Qingmeng.</p><br/><p>Deity Yan was still beautiful in every way. This character had led to the rise of various fanmade novels and comic spin-offs. Most male protagonists had ended up saving Jane Doe Su while imprisoning Yan Qingmeng as a sex slave.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue started picking up novels that featured other existing characters, especially the characters she controlled before. Her characters always had a certain degree of recognition. Some of them even became the protagonists of adult novels\u2026</p><br/><p>But, who was Lady Zhao? She was not ashamed to read adult novels at all. After she was done, she would leave her thoughts in the comment section, using odd, \u201cflavoring\u201d-based analogy.</p><br/><p>Her writing skills were enough to produce her own stories. Even so, she preferred to randomly criticize the writer\u2019s creativity. If she had been a fellow author, her comments would seem to come from a rival\u2019s hatred\u2026</p><br/><p>As the difficulty of the game spiked, more players became attracted to the game. Finally, a VA enthusiast took notice of the credits. Freaking Ah Yu voiced Jane Doe Su! It only got crazier. More digging revealed that most of the background music of the game had been composed by Ah Yu\u2026 Such discovery only drew more fans to the game. Some VA enthusiasts quickly chanted, \u201cThe Great Deity Ah Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was typical of VA enthusiasts to track down a VA\u2019s filmography\u2026 Ah Yu did not have much of a track record. The only notable character she had voiced was \u201cYu Shengfan.\u201d Even so, she had gained a considerable number of fans. Even so, that was only after people found that she was a popular broadcaster as well.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu\u2019s VA fans were a small but loyal following. Her other fans were more interested in her face, her music, and her gaming skills. She was simply extraordinary in all three aspects. She did not have much interest in voice acting. Several major anime production studios had sent her invitations, only to be rejected.</p><br/><p>Her small, hardcore VA fanbase waited with every passing day with bated breath. They would always attempt to speculate on her next role. Knowing that she had played a part in this triple-A game was amazing news!</p><br/><p>They all started playing the game. Sadly, they found themselves stuck before they could even meet Jane Doe Su\u2026 While cursing Zha Feng\u2019s name to damnation, they searched for online tutorials. The uploader of a famous video \u201cNerds are so disgusting\u201d had uploaded a video titled, \u201cFlirting with Dear Jane Doe Su.\u201d While most of Jane Doe Su\u2019s were strictly available in only text, her lines in the CG cutscenes were fully-voiced.</p><br/><p>Her VA fans could only watch the highlights of these</p><br/><p>videos.</p><br/><p>Some netizens started to comment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yu and Deity Su are more similar than you\u2019d think. Some of that woman\u2019s power might have rubbed off her\u2026 Look at her voice roles\u2026 neither Yu Shengfan nor Jane Doe Su ended with happy endings\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yu has so much potential. First was a talkative character, now it is a character who barely speaks. Both of them became epic characters! It\u2019s a shame she did not pursue her voice-acting career\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you joking? I think Ah Yu is better in music, yet she did not pursue that path either. That\u2019s a bigger waste, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ah Yu should become a professional gamer. It is time someone showed those Koreans in LoL that they were not the best\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yu should focus on her studies. Please bear in mind that she studied her ass off getting the title of the best scholar in Jiangnan Province. The next chapter in her studies are coming soon enough. Why did she not choose any university in Beijing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been a while since Ah Yu showed her face in any of broadcasts. She has faded into obscurity even on Weibo. People are starting to forget her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree! Ah Yu\u2019s beauty was always beyond compare. She\u2019s gone so off-grid that I would not even recognize her on the streets!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch is the privilege of a genius. She could be famous anytime she wanted. Popularity is just another statistic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>September came. Lady Zhao started a new chapter in life as a university student.</p><br/><p>Firstly, the legendary army camp that was everyone\u2019s greatest fear\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

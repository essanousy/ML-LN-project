Fortunately, Olivia could always access to the game system.</p><br/><p>Cirilla had been dragged out of the castle by what was left of the royal knights. With Olivia and her grandmother Calanthe still trapped in the castle, she had intended to defend the castle to her last breath. Her knights had not granted her the honor to make that choice.</p><br/><p>Chaos had fallen upon Cintra\u2019s city. Other than the army of Nilfgaardian Empire, some robbers took the opportunity to plunder whatever they could get.</p><br/><p>The only victims were the innocent people of Cintra. Doors were not enough to keep the savages out of their properties. It was savagery\u2026</p><br/><p>Such was the ugly face of war. Humanity would flee, along with conscience and mercy. Until the war ended, only savages and brutes lingered on the street.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, it would not be easy to search for Cirilla, would it?</p><br/><p>It was a tough challenge for Cahir who only had a handful of elite soldiers to command.</p><br/><p>Cahir\u2019s division slowly moved towards the outskirt of Cintra. He escorted Princess Olivia\u2019s carriage personally. His men were sent to look for clues of Cirilla\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p>The army of the Nilfgaardian Empire did not dare to oppose the officer Cahir. He always appeared as an intimidating knight in black, with a pair of wings carved on his helmet. A group of robbers charged at Cahir\u2019s division, attempting to rob the carriage. It did not take long for them to turn into lifeless pieces of flesh.</p><br/><p>Queen Calanthe escaped the war, and Cirilla was nowhere to be found. Princess Olivia was the only target that Cahir had secured for his mission. Without Olivia, he could not face his Emperor Emhyr\u2026</p><br/><p>Cahir could not care less about the inhabitants of this city. However, if they got too close to his carriage, they would meet his blade.</p><br/><p>It might be impossible for Cahir to search for Cirilla, but not for Olivia. The game system provided hints and marked down certain points in her map.</p><br/><p>She used Geralt\u2019s trademark ability to track Cirilla. First, she long-pressed the left button of her mouse. All footprints and scents were now marked in red. All she needed to do now was to follow the red footprints, and the yellow circle of mission objectives in minimap moved accordingly. Viola, she has found Cirilla.</p><br/><p>What? You are saying that Olivia is not a witcher, her senses could not be so keen?</p><br/><p>She had a lot of skill points! Just by spending a point in Witcher Sense would unlock her superhuman sense![1]</p><br/><p>Such was the convenience of a gaming source world. To the natives, it was not a game. In Olivia\u2019s case, it was a VR Role-Playing Game. She was only here to complete her missions.</p><br/><p>How could she complete her missions without any in-game hints?</p><br/><p>Olivia did not rush to look for Cirilla, as she still did not know who drove the carriage. If this person was not on her side, she might expose Cirilla to great danger.</p><br/><p>Besides Olivia, there was a sorceress in the carriage. She was the apprentice of Cahir\u2019s grandmother.</p><br/><p>The sorceress stopped the carriage to notify Cahir that Olivia had regained her consciousness. There was no reason to speak to the princess just yet. Nevertheless, Cahir was glad that Princess Olivia was fine.</p><br/><p>The sorceress returned to the carriage for a brief moment and came out again to convey Olivia\u2019s intention to speak to Cahir.</p><br/><p>Once again, Olivia exercised her flawless acting skills. She realized that the sorceress was treating her with great respect, but she could not figure out why. If her master acted in the same manner, perhaps she could use him to do her bidding.</p><br/><p>Olivia was also good at ad libbing. Leaving a good impression in someone\u2019s mind was no more than drinking a glass of water.</p><br/><p>Cahir rushed into the carriage when he heard that \u201cThe Pearl of Northern Kingdoms\u201d wanted to see him. It was only polite for him to remove his helmet in front of a lady. He was one of the best-looking men in the Nilfgaardian Empire.</p><br/><p>Despite being the captor of Princess Olivia, his attitude towards her was courteous and respectful\u2026</p><br/><p>Together with his sorceress, he had concluded that Princess Olivia was a patriotic noble who would rather die with her country. Cahir did not want to provoke her into seeking death.</p><br/><p>It was easier to control people who feared death. Those who would give away their lives had nothing to lose.</p><br/><p>If Oliva learned of this, she would have burst into laughter. She might be one of Cintra\u2019s nobles, but she could care less about Cintra. Why would a player fall in love with a fabricated country?</p><br/><p>Gamers would only love a gentle female character in a game. People only called themselves fans of some character, but they would never declare that he or she was a fan of some fictional country.</p><br/><p>The only patriot in the game was Calanthe, the ruler of Cintra\u2026</p><br/><p>The sincere respect from Cahir calmed the storm in Olivia\u2019s heart. It was not an appropriate time for her to act as a soft and fragile princess. Instead, she gave off a calm, calculated demeanor, a matured noble member of the ruling family.</p><br/><p>Cahir was surprised. She definitely did not act her age\u2026</p><br/><p>Cahir promised Princess Olivia that he would secure her safety until her meeting with Emperor Emhyr.</p><br/><p>It seemed like her \u201cfather\u201d was doing great. If she did not manage to build her own kingdom, perhaps she could follow his footsteps back to Nilfgaardian Empire and inherit the throne?</p><br/><p>Of course, her sister Cirilla had to be lost or dead for that to happen. She was the true heir before Olivia.</p><br/><p>However, Olivia could not simply ignore Cirilla.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know where my sister is,\u201d Olivia told Cahir right after she was sure that he was a trusted servant of her father.</p><br/><p>Her words changed the expression on Cahir\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Witcher Senses () are a gameplay mechanic introduced in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt; when activated, Geralt focuses his superhuman senses to see clues and tracks that no ordinary human can.

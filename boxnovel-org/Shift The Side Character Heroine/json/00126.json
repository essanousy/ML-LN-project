She could surmise the plot just by looking at the title of it, \u201cWar Heroes\u201d. This was pertaining the war between China and Russia, and spoke of brave warriors who fought for their countries. It looks like the same old war movie with the same old content.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue noticed there were quite a few female characters this time, and she read through their entrailing character roles. There were female nurses, female snipers, female college students and female clerks. In order to portray the cruelty of the Russians, there was also a five-year-old little girl who had lost her family to the Russians. She was the sole survivor of the family, and she was only one meter tall.</p><br/><p>Of course, this little kid was just a side character, so she can\u2019t possibly join in the war to resist the Russians, right?</p><br/><p>The Russians had female characters too. Among them stood the highest rank of all, the Russian Empress Catherine. However, she was a side character as well. This was a drama about war, so there was no way that the Empress would appear on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue finished reading the summary of the script, she started having doubts about possessing any of the female characters, because she felt that this war film had a fair bit of potential. She particularly liked the female sniper character, what if she gave that character the ability to cap someone beyond the radius of 800 miles, wouldn\u2019t she be able to take that one shot on the Russian Empress Catherine, with such a range?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, such an ability would only get \u201csnipped\u201d out by the director.</p><br/><p>This was a realistic and serious war movie, not a fictitious movie. In fact, the theme of these movies would always be iron-blooded, solemn and cruel\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could actually possess the Russian Empress, but this was a movie about China resisting the Russians. If she stirs up trouble with the Russian Empress, it would be ridiculous and the whole script would be rolled up eventually.</p><br/><p>Besides, Zhao Youyue was a Chinese, and she was proud of her own country. She loved her country, unlike other Chinese who insisted that the grass was greener on the other side. She had no interest in possessing any female foreigners.</p><br/><p>After gaining more information about the movie, Zhao Youyue exited the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d and woke up from her nap. She then quickly took out her phone and dug out for more information about \u201cWar Heroes\u201d on the internet.</p><br/><p>She found a fair bit of information on the internet, learning that this series would release one episode per week. The director was an infamous amateur, and his name was Lin Jianzhong.</p><br/><p>The premiere of this war drama had opened up with very average audience ratings, and some sponsors had unexpectedly pulled out of the project. Filming and production budget had been cut down severely, and the boring, mundane plotline had caused this film to have extremely low television viewings, to the point where it was teetering on the edge of cancellation.</p><br/><p>Television series are not that easy to film, because the show would be filming and screening at the same time. They would never be too far ahead, so the plot can always be adjusted according to the audience\u2019s reactions. An \u201cincomplete\u201d television series would give Zhao Youyue the opportunity to mess things up. Zhao Youyue would not have the chance to interrupt a \u201ccompleted\u201d series.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was relieved when she saw this series was in such a sorry state, so she can boldly mess things up even further. She would not have to suffer any consequences even if she causes this film to fail, because there were not many audiences. Besides that, she could choose to possess a side character and let her die quietly so that she can exit the realm. Then, she can proceed to enter a new and more reliable literary world, hopefully one that belonged to a novel or manga.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue originally thought that she could cause more trouble easily with her super tycoon status and as a person with an influential book list. She certainly did not expect the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d to send her into the script of an ongoing television series.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not have anyone who worked in the motion picture industry to contact, so does this mean that she would need to get to know all sorts of directors in the future?</p><br/><p>She found a clip interviewing the amateur director, Lin Jianzhong on the internet. Lin Jianzhong had said it with a balloonful of confidence, \u201cI wanna film the best war movie ever, I will let the audience know the cruelty of war, I will let them know how our ancestors have shed their blood for this country, by portraying a fine example for the military. I only want realistic material for my plots, I got my inspiration from\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt that this film was definitely going to fail when she heard what the amateur director, Lin Jianzhong said. Nobody would want to watch a realistic and cruel war movie. Even though those fictitious anti-Japanese movies get a lot of flak, they had decent viewings. Youngsters would not appreciate such exaggerated and fictitious anti-Japanese movies, but the middle-aged and elderly would definitely enjoy it. The main focus of these movies was not about being anti-Japanese, it was all about how absurd the movies were.</p><br/><p>This world did not have any fictitious anti-Russian movies yet, but because this drama was a dull, arduous series, youngsters found it boring, and the elderly were not amused, they preferred those \u201centertaining\u201d series. The world was already peaceful as it was, and war is something in the past. How can one increase their ratings, if they do not entertain the guests?</p><br/><p>There were already a few iconic movies about the war between Russia and China, how could a normal \u201cWar Heroes\u201d possibly surpass them?</p><br/><p>This amateur director, Lin Jianzhong certainly had great ambitions, he wanted his first movie to be successful. But reality was cruel, not only was his film painfully mediocre, he had even doubted his own abilities as a director of a war movie. This was his childhood dream, he had firmly believed that war was men\u2019s romance!</p><br/><p>Lin Jianzhong had laid his head on the work desk at the moment, and the more he looked at the script, the more he felt that his script was nothing special, but he did not know how to continue writing the plot anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>He put down his pen and let out a hopeless sigh, this is probably the end of \u201cWar Heroes\u201d. Who would want to watch a movie about war? He should try other genres like romantic idol movies, detective movies or even WuXia movies, these were far better than war movies.</p><br/><p>Lin Jianzhong actually wanted to create a unique war movie, but it certainly was not easy to pull off.</p><br/><p>But, he was lucky because Zhao Youyue has entered his realm of creation by chance!</p><br/><p>May realism fly out the window!</p><br/><p>A fictitious movie with countless plot holes is the way to success!</p><br/><p>Youngsters can complain about it, and the elderly would find it entertaining, a movie suitable for all ages!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue has decided to wreak havoc Second battalion commander, where\u2019s your motherf*cking Italian artillery?</p>\n</div>"}

In comparison to those old books, the results from your new one isn\u2019t that good at all, how is it possible to take this chance for an adaptation of your manga?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe adaptation for manga isn\u2019t worth a lot of money in the first place. Even if you give it out for free, I wonder if anyone is willing to take it, as nobody will want to read it once you finish the comic. Isn\u2019t he going to starve to death, that poor artist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct, what kind of idiotic artist is willing to adapt your crappy novel into mangas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, it is very irresponsible of Qidian novel website to take only the electronic copyrights of the work. Why don\u2019t they just take the whole copyright and act as a dealer for us? It saves our time and less trouble for us as writers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? If Qidian has the dealership for the whole copyright, they can sell it for 5 million. Then, they will inform you that they sold it for 500 thousand, and pay you 250 thousand with tax excluded. I can assure you that you will still be over the moon even though you have been deceived!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that the main topic had strayed too far away, until Su Li began chatting in the group.</p><br/><p>Su Li sent a message, \u201cAre you sure you want to give it away for free? I really want to adapt \u2018The Strongest King\u2019 into a manga. It is indeed a wonderful novel. I\u2019ve read it up to the latest chapter in one shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the mangaka Su Li appeared in the group, all went quiet at once. After all, there were some Godly writers just mentioned that it was impossible for Rosemary\u2019s \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d to be adapted into manga. Of course, they had never read the book \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d before. They merely judged the novel based on the results and they would never understand the true potential of this book. From their perspective, a book with an approximate 4,000 average subscriptions was just normal, if compared to other books that have over 10,000 average subscriptions.</p><br/><p>After the awkward silence, they started regaining their senses. Everyone in the group was filled with enthusiasm after realising Su Li\u2019s identity\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god! Isn\u2019t this Su Li who had obtained her Godlike status with her sole manga \u2018Pure Romance\u2019! Let\u2019s kneel and pray the God.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually seeing a living Master Su Li. Your \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 was fantastic! But the ending was a little\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ending was the best, alright. What do you even understand? This is an ending befitting a God-like novel. Always supporting goddess Su Li!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that Su Li is a mangaka who just graduated from her university. Can I ask for a picture? I just want to lick my screen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, can you guys be more gentlemen? I cannot stand this level of lousiness, just look at you guys. Anyways, Master Su Li, may I ask you out for a meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPraise Master Su Li, I really want to know what your new work will be \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, in this \u201cLone Elderly Club\u201d, most of the male writers were single. As for Su Li, she was pulled into this club just because she was the creator of \u201cPure Romance\u201d where the novel was directed to the male readers. It seemed pretty natural for her to become the main attraction in the club. After all, who doesn\u2019t like a gorgeous female artist?</p><br/><p>There is a Japanese artist named Yoshihiro Togashi whom people call \u201cTogashi the old sly\u201d. He got the nickname for marrying a beautiful artist named Naoko Takeuchi. Because she was the mangaka of an infamous manga \u201cSailor Moon\u201d, a fair, rich and beautiful woman whose family is running a jewellery business. Su Li\u2019s family background might not be able to compete with Naoko Takeuchi. Furthermore, the influence of \u201cPure Romance\u201d could also not parallel that of \u201cSailor Moon\u201d, but still, she is way prettier than Naoko Takeuchi. There were some of them who shared Su Li\u2019s photos and videos online in the group. Whenever Su Li was in her makeup, she looked exactly like a goddess where her beauty was on the top. Besides, Naoko Takeuchi has gained her age whereas Su Li is still in her youth. On top of that, she even mentioned that she did not have a boyfriend nor have any experience in love during an interview\u2026</p><br/><p>With only these two facts, those otaku fans of Su Li had already regarded her as their goddess. Among the \u201cSu Li Fashion\u201d, they were mostly these kinds of fans. Obviously, the single ones from the \u201cLone Elderly Club\u201d found that Su Li\u2019s charm was irresistible. As for some Godly authors who liked to toy with the readers, they were deeply impressed with this genius mangaka who was able to sell the point that her ending was going to be a happy reunion. Yet she killed all her characters and allowed them to \u201creunite\u201d in their afterlife. They would not have the guts to do so if they were the writers.</p><br/><p>What if it went overboard, ruining the whole book and in turn destroying their reputation. The loss would outweigh the gain. However, Su Li\u2019s \u201cPure Romance\u201d ending was detested by a lot of male readers, but due to the popularity of her \u201cNice boat\u201d ending, more and more readers knew about \u201cPure Romance\u201d. Then, they fell into the same pit and consequently made the book more famous, even after the story had finished!</p><br/><p>It was imaginable that many companies were headed over heels to get the copyrights of the book. A well-known gaming company in Japan had stated that they would like to make a galge based on \u201cPure Romance\u201d. The Japanese name for the male protagonist would be \u201cItou Makoto\u201d.</p><br/><p>In any case, Su Li\u2019s reputation far exceeded her income nowadays. What could she do? It was very difficult to develop sideline products for genre like \u201cPure Romance\u201d. If not, she would be able to live the rest of her life with only \u201cPure Romance\u201d.</p><br/><p>Su Li did not care about the rest and sent the message once again, emphasizing that she was truly considering to adapt \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d into a manga. She could not help bragging, \u201cThis is actually the suggestion of my number one Sect Master \u2018Youyue\u2019. She really likes the book \u2018The Strongest King\u2019. Besides, she had already promised to tip my new work a Silver Sect Master.</p><br/><p>When the name \u201cYouyue\u201d came up in the group, there was a commotion\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cYouyue is quite a popular tycoon reader in Qidian website. I cannot believe she actually likes the book \u2018The Strongest King\u2019 from Rosemary?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just checked the web page interface of \u2018The Strongest King\u2019. She just tipped a Sect Master. I envy him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, Youyue is also a Sect Master for my book, too bad she is not in my fans\u2019 group.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow? Silver Sect Master costs about 10,000 coins. I envy that Su Li has such a super tycoon as her fan, but did he not do that just to chase you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, Su Li\u2026. Did you just mention Lady Youyue? Isn\u2019t he a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould be a man, but the account information says that it\u2019s a she\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Su Li saw this group of people assuming that the cute Lady Youyue was a man, she could not stand it anymore. She sent a selfie of her together with Zhao Youyue in the group. Actually, she took these pictures with the purpose of showing off at the perfect time. After all, she had a perfect female reader, Zhao Youyue which allowed her to brag for the rest of her life!</p><br/><p>When all the photos of Su Li and Zhao Youyue were shared in the group, including the picture of the luxurious car with the plate number \u201c58888\u201d, everyone was astounded!</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the pictures in the group, Rosemary suddenly recollected his memory of not taking Sect Master Youyue seriously. As of this moment, his heart was filled with many regrets!</p>\n</div>"}

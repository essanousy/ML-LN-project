Being Zhao Youyue however, she would rather use such an ability at her expense. After all, she is a kind soul, as long as one does not push her buttons.</p><br/><p>For example, after taking note of the bullet curtain that asked her to turn on the camera, she replied, \u201cI could have used my pretty face to earn money, instead of my talentI am different from Ming Ming, and that is why I do not plan to turn on the camera.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience went silent for a while after her self-deprecating reply. Then, they began to reply her with \u201c666\u201d. So, \u201cMing Ming\u201d earned money by using her pretty face.</p><br/><p>People started to notice that \u201cDouyu Yu Shengfan\u201d was a completely different person today. There was none of that shrill, ear-piercing Lolita snarling, but a very soothing and charming voice of a young girl. However, one could tell that they were the same person if one listens carefully, as there were some similar mannerisms between those voices.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue soon discovered that she could now skilfully switch between a \u2018Lolita\u2019s voice\u201d, and the Bouyomi [1] style of a Tri-no Girl. She even believed that she had what it takes to become a voice actor of these characters, she would be able to carry out those roles flawlessly.</p><br/><p>Noticing her style had changed, many bullet curtains started to come in, asking\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with our Xiao Yu today? There is no venomous tongue at all, so dull!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am pretty sure that our Xiao Yu can use her pretty face to earn money, it\u2019s just that she wants to use her talent\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough today is different, I still like you. Every day I will watch you play your games, because it makes me very happy. Unfortunately, I can only send you the free fish ball and some likes, as I am no tycoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this change is good for once. Xiao Yu is sure cute as the novel character, but she would be plain annoying in real life! Think of what would happen if you meet a gamer who is as sarcastic and bb [2] as she is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019m dying from boredom due to the lack of iconic Xiao Yu insults, this feels pretty soothing. Anyhow, she is still my favorite streamer. I am sending her an airplane!\u201d</p><br/><p>The manipulators on Douyu refer to Zhao Youyue as \u201cXiao Yu\u201d or \u201cAh Yu\u201d. Even though she was still infamously notorious, her die-hard fanbase has rapidly picked up. She was slowly and steadily becoming successful.</p><br/><p>This is the actual rule of streaming in reality; success comes with perseverance. Nevertheless, many people would give up as they saw no immediate improvement.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was definitely not going to give up. Under the influence of \u201cYu Shengfan,\u201d she began to enjoy playing games genuinely. She started racking up victories, thanks to her improved skills and knowledge. This certainly gave rise to her passion!</p><br/><p>Thus, she downloaded the \u201cKing of Glory\u201d again on her cell phone, simply blasting out a wide spray of \u201cPesticide\u201d and carrying her entire team. It was exhilarating!</p><br/><p>She was clueless as to why she had screwed-up in this game previously, as it is so easy to play. She was very masterful at it now, constantly being worshiped by her teammates. The morale of her opponents would decrease upon seeing her heroes, where they were all killed like dogs.</p><br/><p>Then, while looking at the bullet curtain, Zhao Youyue spoke to the mic \u201cFirst, my thanks to [Ai Ai Ai Young Lady [3] for the airplaneToday, I\u2019m going to play a mobile card game, \u201d Onmyoji.\u201d It is a card collecting game. It is not particularly popular, but once you taste its charm, you will definitely start indulging, summoning non-stop for the endless surprises. It is as addictive as the \u201cKing of Glory.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, she showed the audiences the game on her cell phone. Upon opening it, the player would be greeted by a mysterious summoning circle that was so clich yet nostalgic at the same time. The atmosphere was good</p><br/><p>The audiences started to discuss among themselves\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never played this game, but I\u2019ve heard about it, and it is said to be an endless bait. Only the European Kings could afford to play it, not an African like me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe game is well made. However, it extremely difficult to summon a SSR card!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see a lot of potential, especially in the end-game. The fun part is the unknown nature of summoning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait for Xiao Yu to show us her skillful draw skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, did Ah Yu just thank a person for the present? Tell us who you are! Has our Ah Yu been possessed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue noticed the tremor caused by the bullet curtain; everyone agreed that she was not Xiao Yu. She refuted wearily \u201cI am Xiao Yu. Actually, Xiao Yu has three forms, and the venomous tongue is one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without further ado, she began to stream the \u201csummoning spree.\u201d It was a repetitive process that involved one submitting a set of materials in order to summon a card. So, as to be expected of her African Chieftain [4] genes, she started her first draw that was worth One thousand RMB. After noticing that there was no SSR card, all of the audience were shocked and felt sorry for her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue remained calm and said \u201cEveryone should know a certain phrase, there is nothing that money can\u2019t buy. I will buy it again! RIP Liver!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many manipulators once thought that Xiao Yu had simply proclaimed herself as a Missy due to her adolescent delusions, but they changed their minds after seeing her spend millions of RMB on this game. Many bullet curtains expressed their shock, they never would have thought that she really was a tycoon!</p><br/><p>This proved the power of money, turning an African into a European King. She managed to draw two SSR cards! All at once, her deck matched the level of the Gods, and she started wiping out her enemies with ease!</p><br/><p>By being rich, everyone can be a Dalao [5]!</p><br/><p>Then, she noticed that the number of audiences had reached millions. It seemed that the audience loved watching whalers in action</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Bouyomi is used by the anime fans to describe the unskilful voice actor whose voice is emotionless, less of impact, and does not portray the image of the character.</p><br/><p>[2] bb describes a gamer who is noisy and nagging nonstop.</p><br/><p>[3] Ai Ai Ai Young Lady (): Its literal translation \u201cA girl who touches people\u2019s hearts\u201d, it is a play on the Mandarin Phonetic \u2018Ai\u2019, with each \u2018Ai\u2019 carrying different meaning.means love, is the interjection of disapproval/regret and which could mean dim (of daylight)/obscure/clandestine/dubious.</p><br/><p>[4] African Chieftan () is an internet slang that is used to describe unlucky individuals as based on Chinese culture, black color is associated with misfortune.</p><br/><p>[5] Dalao is an internet slang used to describe the gamer whose fleet strength is stronger than the average gamer.</p>\n</div>"}

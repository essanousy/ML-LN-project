At that time, he had completely abandoned his sanity!</p><br/><p>As Liu Kang\u2019s fear grew from his hallucination it had started an endless cycle that infinitely strengthened Chu Renmei\u2019s hold on his mind as she terrified him further in return for even more of his neural bandwidth</p><br/><p>Firstly, he went to that old latrine alone. As he was peeing, he \u201csaw\u201d a ghost face emerging from the cesspit. Terrified, he had bolted outside. Amazingly, he did not forget to wash his hands. He happened to notice a water tank on his way out. He rushed over to wash his hands, dipping them into the tank. When he withdrew them, only did he realize that it was not clear water, but black blood!</p><br/><p>At the same time, he saw a girl in blue clothes, singing an opera from inside the tank. Her voice froze him on the spot \u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>As you were having fun, I was feeling sad.</p><br/><p>Only the moon knows of the grievances within my heart.</p><br/><p>Difficult to meet, yet easy to part.</p><br/><p>An abandoned woman I am, too late for regrets.</p><br/><p>Do you still remember the times when we were deeply in love?</p><br/><p>Do you still remember how you left me for another?</p><br/><p>Do you still remember leaving your wife with no roof over her head?</p><br/><p>Do you still remember my son who was without a father?</p><br/><p>I guess you wouldn\u2019t know this, but toiled alone did it, to the point of illness, because of you.</p><br/><p>Soon, death would take me, a heart shattered into a million pieces, because of you!</p><br/><p>Liu Kang had completely lost it by then. He ran out, screaming. By the time he hid at the corner of the courtyard, he was already deep inside his hallucination!</p><br/><p>The scene in the latrine had also been a hallucination. That tasteful scene of \u2014\u2014 Liu Kang\u2019s head half flushed down the cesspit.</p><br/><p>The real Liu Kang\u2019s body was in the courtyard. But his mind had been lost in an entirely different world, where he was being hunted in all kinds of ways. While thinking that he was saving himself, his body started killing himself!</p><br/><p>The final scene in his mind was one of the fierce ghost Chu Renmei using her white hand, black nails to press his head into the cesspit. A most horrible death!</p><br/><p>As his body struggled, he took a huge fork, and thrusted it down his mouth, not stopping until it came out of the other end. Then, in his final throes, he jumped into the bonfire. His clothes burned off, flying off in the heat as ash. His body eventually became a roasted pork.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, when he turned himself into a roasted pork on the bonfire at the end, he must have been possessed by Chu Renmei. A human might not exactly be able to throttle himself to death, or bite his own tongue to commit suicide. Those were all just hearsay. On the other hand, spiritual possession answered many other questions</p><br/><p>Ghosts had a blatant disrespect and disregard for physics. When possessed by a ghost, you might just be able to pick yourself off the ground by pulling on your scalp!</p><br/><p>It might be notoriously difficult to even picture this scene. This was understandable as most worlds did not have ghosts. It would be equally understandable to encounter such ghosts in supernatural worlds. Perhaps ghosts were able to modify the laws of phsyics, or something of the like!</p><br/><p>They definitely broke the laws discovered by great minds like Newton and Einstein!</p><br/><p>It was almost downright cartoonish. Gravity was key to everything. Even if one fell from from the sky, her short skirt would obediently remain wrapped around her thighs. No one could ever see what that should not be seen. Videographers should just give up on trying to get lucky. You would never catch sight of them!</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, asking an actor to act out a scene like Liu Kang\u2019s self-spitroasting was a tall order. The word \u201csuffocation\u201d simply did not suffice. However great an imagination one had, no one could ever imagine such a scene in their head</p><br/><p>The scene left Zhao Youyue severely nauseated. She was unable to transform into the black cat in the real world. As \u201cYouyue Meow\u201d she would be just as terrified, if not worse!</p><br/><p>In the supernatural source world, the black cat she had turned into had not been afraid of ghosts. It could work hand in glove with them, and even punish them if it desired. The most rational of ghosts would actually show Zhao Youyue due respect. They would even give her offerings after they have harvested from their kills. Evidently, they were afraid of black cats. They would rather please them rather than piss them off.</p><br/><p>Ghosts might be hunters to humans. But the black cat was one ladder rung up the chain!</p><br/><p>Ghosts also came in different levels. Fierce ghosts were basically as intelligent as humans. Others might not even be able to communicate, or did not know how to. When these silly ghosts encountered the black cat, they served as nothing but freebie snacks. Zhao Youyue decided to impose a sanction on ghosts, the next time she entered the supernatural source world. Considered it as compensation for the troubles of the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>The Zhao Youyue in the real world did not possess that strong, invincible player mentality. Therefore, the movie had left her very uncomfortable. The scene that followed had been more disgusting. Humans eating raw human meat She did not expect herself to pass through this movie unscathed.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the state of the physical body had an effect on one\u2019s consciousness. After all, she had been a supernaturally powerful black cat with supernatural abilities. The black cat might have witnessed far more scenes that were even more tragic and disgusting. This scene was probably peanuts to her</p><br/><p>The pampered, sheltered Lady who barely even ventured into the horror realm would most certainly be disturbed.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was an absolute feast to horror movie addicts. Even if it was bloody and disgusting, so what?</p><br/><p>All the better for them!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue remembered that Su Li seemed to love such horror movies. Everytime when she had a movie date with Zhao Youyue, she wanted to watch horror movies. The more horrifying, the better!</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue had never once been interested. Lady Zhao\u2019s taste in movies had always been silly. She loved to watch those brainless, popcorn-snacking movies. Celebrations, big ocassions. The bigger the better. Relaxing comedy was also a huge plus. That was all it took for her to enjoy herself</p><br/><p>Su the Great Deity had heavy tastes indeed. She wanted horror movies at their fullest, biggest, and loudest, in the cinema!</p><br/><p>This was the real Su Li. Her current work was almost vanilla, despite what others thought of it. Her true nature desired for all sorts of bloody, violent scenes in the future. She considered it a unique form of art.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s heavy taste was one thing, but she greatly respected Zhao Youyue\u2019s choices each time. Thus, she could only watch those horror movies alone. Admittedly, it was actually more interesting to watch such movies alone, especially during midnight.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was truly keen on finding out Su Li\u2019s verdict when watching a \u201c100% realistic\u201d horror movie\u2026</p><br/><p>But first, she had to add the final touches to this movie, and prepare to give the audience of the real world the greatest scare ever!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

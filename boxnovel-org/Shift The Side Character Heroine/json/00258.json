He did not even read ero mangas such as \u201cPure Romance.\u201d That was why he believed in the rumors about Lady Zhao from the start.</p><br/><p>Currently, he believed that Zhao Youyue was not from a poor family. On the contrary, she was quite rich. She must be someone\u2019s precious daughter, taking rides on luxury cars, wherever she went.</p><br/><p>His previous misjudgment gave him great stress. Moreover, when Zhao Youyue\u2019s studies improved so drastically, he felt that it was gradually harder for him to like Zhao Youyue. He considered her to be out of his league.</p><br/><p>Chen Haoran was a devout believer in the practice of \u2018marriage between families of equal social rank.\u2019 His parents have brought him up that way. A marriage between families of unequal social rank would have no happy ending. It was also partly why he had insisted on not starting a relationship at a young age. If he likes a girl, he would always take a step back to see whether he is worthy to be her match. He would never spare girls he considered beneath him a second glance.</p><br/><p>Besides, he took his love relationship very seriously. He aimed for marriage.</p><br/><p>Although he came from a village, his family owned a fish pond of his own. He was not poor, although his wealth would be incomparable to Lady Zhao\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Chen Haoran felt that this was the day to confess, as he and Zhao Youyue will not be in the same class soon. Her inspirational music had also spurred him on. While he has the courage, he should strike while the iron is hot. If Zhao Youyue turns even more bedazzling in the near future, he would lose this opportunity.</p><br/><p>He felt depressed, not knowing why Zhao Youyue and his best brother Leng Zi chose to leave together. He even suspected that they were dating, and were perhaps watching a movie together or something. However, the moment he saw them entering a beauty salon, he became dumbfounded. What are they actually doing?</p><br/><p>Nobody dates there. They were definitely not a couple. What\u2019s the relationship between them then?</p><br/><p>Chen Haoran did not want to think anymore. He had always been a very straight-laced person. Zhao Youyue was the only object in his eyes at that moment. He immediately stood up, left the coffee shop, and ran towards her. He managed to stop her before she got into a low-key luxury car.</p><br/><p>Then, he finally noticed the girl beside Zhao Youyue. She totally threw him off his determined train of thought. How can someone be so cute? This \u2018girl\u2019 who had makeup on, was way prettier than a Zhao Youyue without makeup!</p><br/><p>Who is she? Is she Zhao Youyue\u2019s bestie?</p><br/><p>Whatever, but why does she look so familiar?</p><br/><p>Why is she so shy? She had hidden herself behind Zhao Youyue, like a frightened rabbit, the moment he approached them</p><br/><p>A slight ripple surged through Chen Haoran\u2019s heart. Some guys might prefer little girls more. It was unfortunate that Lady Zhao seldom appeared like that. She was always so calm and tolerant, carrying herself like a noble.</p><br/><p>Chen Haoran did not recognize \u2018her\u2019 true gender, let alone relate \u2018her\u2019 to Han Leng. A village boy like Chen Haoran who totally focused on studying, would not even be aware of such a thing as \u2018cross-dressing.\u2019 From his limited experience, he had an idea about the existence of \u2018females cross-dressing into males,\u2019 and that they could be easily uncovered. He had never heard about males cross-dressing into females.</p><br/><p>After all, he knew nothing about the 2D world\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Leng was this close to a nervous breakdown. His best brother Chen Haoran has suddenly appeared, out of nowhere. He would have no qualms about cross-dressing in front of strangers, but he would never be able to maintain that composure in front of a familiar face!</p><br/><p>Han Leng would be able to take flak from anyone and anything, but not his own blood brother!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s face was filled with joy when she saw Han Leng\u2019s reaction. This is exactly what she wanted to see. The totally horrified face, the fear of being recognized after cross-dressing, especially by someone he knew well.</p><br/><p>It looked like Han Leng was more concerned about Chen Haoran more than her. In Zhao Youyue\u2019s eyes at this moment, Han Leng no longer had principles at all. He cared nothing about his image anymore. A shameless guy like him would have the most powerful heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Haoran, is something the matter?\u201d asked Zhao Youyue, taking the initiative.</p><br/><p>Due to his appearance, Han Leng had been jumping about like a jellybean, behind her back. Lady Zhao was pleased. She has a good mood. Her tone was ever so gentle and kind.</p><br/><p>Yet, she never saw Chen Hao Ran\u2019s next actions coming. He suddenly knelt on one knee and shouted, \u201cZhao Youyue, I like you! I\u2019ve always liked you at first sight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He talked a lot, mainly about how great eyesight he had in the past, to be able to realize her beauty when she was merely a passerby.</p><br/><p>In general, girls may be touched by his sincerity, and yet reject him straightforwardly, despite being so touched. Who the heck comes up with such a sudden confession to someone he is completely unfamiliar to?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not touched at all. She only felt ice creeping up her back. Not even the slightest ripple surged within her heart. However, as polite as always, she waited quietly for Chen Haoran to finish his confession. Then, with a bow, she declined his confession euphemistically, saying, \u201cThank you for liking such a normal person like me. But I have no intention of starting a love relationship, be it in the past, present, or future. You\u2019re a good guy; you deserve a better girl than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Chen Haoran had already expected such an ending, he still felt despondent for being friend zoned. Is this how it feels to be lovelorn?</p><br/><p>Well, at least I received an actual reply, and avoided possible further damage from ambiguous situations in future. This was probably the best ending\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Haoran soon limped away, distraught. His back was visibly twitching. Han Leng frowned. He pitied his brother. He asked with some dissatisfaction, \u201cLady Zhao, don\u2019t you think it was a bit too direct to reject people in such a way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just being honest. Or do you think that I should give him some hope and let him sink deeper?\u201d replied Zhao Youyue calmly.</p><br/><p>Han Leng found her reply reasonable. He disliked girls who chose not to reject a suitor explicitly. He actually preferred Zhao Youyue\u2019s truthful, explicit kind of way. But Chen Haoran was also his best brother\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him. Allow me to excuse myself,\u201d said Han Leng. He then left Zhao Youyue alone and chased after Chen Haoran.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was actually curious to see what will happen between the two of them. This should be interesting. According to her understanding on Han Leng, he would most likely pretend to be his own sister. It would make sense for a sister to be concerned about her brother\u2019s best brother.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue sent Han Leng a Wechat message, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare forget that you owe me a few sets of cross-dressing photos. Don\u2019t ever try to repudiate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, Zhao Youyue had another pressing matter to deal with, that was to voice act as \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 of \u201cThe Strongest King.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

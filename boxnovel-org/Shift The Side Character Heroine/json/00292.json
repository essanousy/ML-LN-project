But, I\u2019ll be running the 3,000-metres tomorrow, no matter what. After all, I\u2019m supposed to be the runner. They would certainly spot our swap, and you would only end up running in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue replied after a moment, having pondered over Bai Yunshan\u2019s stubborn reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? How did you know?!\u201d Bai Yunshan turned red for the first time ever, which was uncharacteristic of her, but surprisingly cute. She had always fought hard to maintain her dignity as a class rep.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan was actually a girl, but she had no clue on how to dress herself up. She had no drive in the pursuit of beauty whatsoever. She could be drop-dead gorgeous, only if she put the slightest bit of care in that aspect. Long hair suited her more, not her unstyled short crop that made her look like a little boy.</p><br/><p>Natural beauties do not come by so easily. Not everyone was like Lady Zhao. However, anyone ever picked up on Zhao Youyue\u2019s research and gain appropriate knowledge of dressing up, facial care as well as makeup, they would actually stand a chance.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s knowledge were not just restricted to the straight road to beauty, she had a genderless, or rather, asexual soul. She could doll herself up according to male standards of female beauty and female standards of female beauty. By dolling herself up according to the gender of her target, she could become the height of physical attractiveness in front of either gender.</p><br/><p>According to her personal experience, Bai Yunshan was a ticking bombshell. She already had beauty above the average person, and that was without a single care being given to her appearance. With the slightest bit of care, she would transcend the world.</p><br/><p>Such remolding would have much room before University live hardens the clay. When it comes to females, Year 1 and Year 4 photos would share little connection to each other.</p><br/><p>Even thickset ladies had possible potentials. Once they slim down, everyone has a chance at beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know everything. There is nothing that escapes my eyes,\u201d Zhao Youyue proudly stood with arms akimbo, but not for long. This was actually \u2018Xiao Chun\u201ds signature pose. Xiao Chun would do so every time she makes a proclamation of victory before a race. In her mind, it was the coolest pose possible for a humanoid. However, she would always end up embarrassing herself.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had applied \u2018Zhou Chun\u2019s card\u2019 for a bit too long on that day. There would be some aftereffects left in its wake.</p><br/><p>As for why Zhao Youyue knew of Bai Yunshan\u2019s period, Bai Yunshan\u2019s deskmate, Qiu Ya had told her about the matter. Qiu Ya came from a rather rural area. She was actually a very kind person. Just because she had not cooperated with Bai Yunshan to be her witness, the steadfast enforcer of rules had dismissed her as one of those outlaws and had shunned her ever since. Qiu Ya could only choose to approach Zhao Youyue on that matter.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s spies surrounded Bai Yunshan like an intelligence network. Zhao Youyue would never run short of informants, reporting Bai Yunshan\u2019s every move. Everyone had positioned themselves against the class rep like so, mirroring her tendencies of being the teachers\u2019 informant.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ya soon decided to tell Zhao Youyue about Bai Yunshan\u2019s period. She did not want Bai Yunshan to insist on making her own life difficult. At the end of the day, they were all girls. They knew about the inconveniences of those few days that came every month.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had initially remained silent on that matter. She had intended to test Bai Yunshan, to see what lengths she would go to keep her promise. The moment she realized that Bai Yunshan would remain true to her word till the end \u2013 regardless of her condition, she caved in.</p><br/><p>Such a silly and upright girl was truly a concern.</p><br/><p>On the other side of things, Zhao Youyue did not know that Bai Yunshan considered her silly as well. She would always be taken advantage of by others, get toyed around by others, and still went on her ways like nothing was happening. She was too aloof for her own good. Although Bai Yunshan considered Zhao Youyue a bad person, she could not stand seeing Zhao Youyue get used by worse folk.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Bai Yunshan had turned both eyes to Shen Menglian. If Shen Menglian still refuses to retrain herself after this sports event, this Master Class Rep with a maxed out snitching skill would \u2018service\u2019 Shen Menglian to her utmost.</p><br/><p>This time, no matter how persistent Bai Yunshan is, she would never be able to dispute Zhao Youyue. After all, it was Zhao Youyue\u2019s name that had been noted down. If she runs in Zhao Youyue\u2019s place, they may not accept it. She would only be running to torture herself.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan felt helpless. She very much hated the idea of being in someone\u2019s debt. Therefore, she would never take advantage of others, neither would she give the others the opportunity to take advantage of her. If someone approaches her for a loan, she would reply with one solid word \u2014\u2014 Nope!</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan considered borrowing from others as a form of taking advantage of others. If it was a small amount, most would not even return it. If it was a big amount, how could she simply agree to lend them the money?</p><br/><p>Besides, she would never possibly be in a position to owe others money. If that\u2019s the case, why should she lend hers?</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan\u2019s theory made sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow metoinvite you fora dinner this weekend, then. Our class\u2019 success in this event was all thanks to you. It had been my fault since the beginning. I knew that not many would sign up for the long-distance event. Fewer would actually help me. Therefore, the moment Shen Menglian told me that you had signed up for all of the long-distance events, I leaped at the opportunity without thinking much. I double-checked it with you after that, and you actually nodded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan was sincerely apologetic. She was not completely free of blame. It clearly made no sense, yet she had still signed Zhao Youyue up. Subconsciously, she might be glazed over that glaring abnormality for her own convenience.</p><br/><p>In retrospect she had been selfish, and it left her feeling extremely uncomfortable, all the more when Zhao Youyue did not appear bothered by at all. She was still treating her so nicely.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Zhao Youyue had turned out to be excellent in long-distance running. If not, she would have been publicly humiliated.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan realized that she now owed Zhao Youyue too much. Zhao Youyue who she had considered to be the prime example of one without a collective sense of honor, had turned out to contribute the most to the class!</p><br/><p>Due to this turn of events, her initial impression towards Zhao Youyue had been shaken to the core. Perhaps Zhao Youyue was actually a good person. She had simply been misunderstood.</p><br/><p>The moment Zhao Youyue heard Bai Yunshan\u2019s invitation, she smiled. It was just to be expected. No matter how difficult a girl can be, they were all the same slice of cake to her. Bai Yunshan now approved of her.</p><br/><p>Taking Bai Yunshan\u2019s zero-waste dietary habits into consideration, Zhao Youyue replied, \u201cSure, but we don\u2019t have to dine at a restaurant. Just buy me some ingredients. I\u2019m quite confident in my cooking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The way she ate would only create another world war, if they chose to dine at a restaurant.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan was startled. This Zhao Youyue is also good at cooking? What else is she not good at?</p><br/><p>As if she had read her mind, Zhao Youyue replied with a knowing smile, \u201cI know everything. There is nothing that I do not know.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spun on her heel and left at that, leaving the other girl with a perfect view of her back.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan felt that the omniscient and omnipotent Zhao Youyue was truly a force to be reckoned.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

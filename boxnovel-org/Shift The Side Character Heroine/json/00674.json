A short chat with her, and she had given him so many fresh ideas and inspirations that he had walked away as a better writer\u2026</p><br/><p>Naturally, Xiao Yiren was peppered with questions from his parents as he was on the way back. They were asking things about Lady Zhao. He recalled how he was helplessly suppressed by her the entire journey, and could only laugh sheepishly to their questions. Unable to zero in on the situation, his parents instead said things about how Zhao Youyue was actually a pretty good person. No, she was just too good. No one at her age would be able to match her.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren remembered her vividly in his heart, as he had just seen another side of Zhao Youyue. Perhaps, one day, he might choose her as the main character of his novel. Of course, it would still revolve around the premise of shifting worlds. He could then confidently make Lady Zhao single.</p><br/><p>Later, Xiao Yiren was asked by Lady Zhao to create a cameo character called \u2018Wu Lili.\u2019 It was supposed to turn his \u201cShift! The Female Elite Scholar\u201d into something exceptional, but instead, it all crumbled down. He struck rock bottom\u2026</p><br/><p>He blamed himself for it. He was just too young. His first book had been too successful for his own good. He became overly engrossed with writing, until finally, his psyche shattered into shards that showered around him.</p><br/><p>To this, he felt extremely apologetic towards his loyal reader, Lady Zhao. Therefore, the next time Xiao Yiren heard that Zhao Youyue would be joining him for dinner, he decided to stay out of it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren had initially longed for romance and freedom. He had thought that he would have been able to experience a profoundly moving relationship with the perfect reader in his heart, Zhao Youyue. However, in the end, he lost all contact with Zhao Youyue\u2026</p><br/><p>Unless Xiao Yiren stands on top of the literary world, he would never have the courage to face Zhao Youyue again. The most he could do was write about her in his own stories.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren knew that Zhao Youyue was the only girl who had moved his heart in his entire life. She was just too perfect and excellent. She was just like one of his fictional female characters. However, he was just too useless. When a girl like this appeared in real life, he had to avoid her, as he was a cold-hearted male chauvinist.</p><br/><p>Fame would not solve the weakness in his personality. He was a coward. He only felt like he mattered to the world whenever he wrote a story.</p><br/><p>The only thing in this world that gave him warmth was his readers\u2019 love. Sadly, the Elite Scholar book currently gave him nothing but malice. He only had himself to blame, which did not help his already poor confidence. He still could not tell if he could recover from this.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there were still many tolerant fairy-godmother/father readers in this world. They brought the depressed \u2018Drunk for Her\u2019 out of his slump. He finally succeeded in attaining the \u2018High God\u2019 position in his niche, unpopular genre.</p><br/><p>Sadly when that finally happened, he could no longer find the missy who had moved his heart in the beginning. His successful work had been based on the girl who had moved his heart.</p><br/><p>Others might even think that he was talking nonsense and stretching facts. Little did they know that the real world actually housed such a missy. They also did not know that her name was Zhao Youyue. She was lively, cheerful, and elegant. She was not short of \u2018friends\u2019 around her. She enjoyed a life full of luxury and refinement. She had always been single, as no man could walk inside her heart.</p><br/><p>She was far too experienced. She had seen far too much. No trick was new to her. Sincerity would never win her over. She just wanted to live in bliss. It was her right.</p><br/><p>She would never know that a guy who she once knew had written a multi-million word-length romance novel that was based on her. Every single word and paragraph in there professed his love towards her. He had placed her on the highest of all pedestals.</p><br/><p>In reality, they shared nothing in common. At least, he could pour all of his love on her in his writings. Even if she never reads it, his readers most definitely appreciated it, judging by the success.</p><br/><p>On Zhao Youyue\u2019s hand, that one dinner was the only time she ever encountered him. After that dinner, Lady Zhao had said that she wanted to see some same-aged girls the next time they met up for dinner. As for same-aged guys, that was a no-no. Well, she could do with male creators.</p><br/><p>It had been a most odd directive. What were the odds of them finding an excellent male creator who was her age?</p><br/><p>Some people just needed to enjoy the worlds created by creators. They did not have to create things on their own. Basically, their parents would never allow them to go down that path. On the contrary, they should learn how to manage other humans. They were bound to inherit empires from their families, they should learn to act like a ruler.</p><br/><p>The majority of creators were essentially failures. Even more so, if you compared them to those who were born with status. Therefore, failures could only pursue success in the spiritual world.</p><br/><p>They could earn success in reality upon death. If they had created classics, those books would never be forgotten. They might even have the power to form entirely new source worlds. On the other hand, those so-called rulers and superiors would be forgotten by history.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue gave every outstanding creator her respect. In her eyes, these cute creators were more interesting, compared to those who slogged meaninglessly every day.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue soon put everything that happened today behind her. She did not even finish reading \u2018Shift! The Female Elite Scholar.\u2019 The first few chapters of this book had not been that bad. It was just that how the Otaku male chauvinist appreciated beauty was quite off-putting for her. The last few chapters she read had been repetitive. The world was vast. It was inevitable that his popularity would decline.</p><br/><p>Interestingly, Zhao Youyue had entered this work at random in the past. However, she did not think that it could have been saved. It would be better to tear it apart and make her exit\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, she had possessed \u2018Wu Lili\u2019 and tore the place up. She even gave her god-like, nature-ending powers. No author would accept such ideas into the final cut. Little did she expect \u2018Drunk For Her\u2019 to be so stupid. He was as stupid as a pig!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was also ashamed of her actions. Both of them had ended up being afraid of meeting each other.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue tried to compensate for the whole situation by creating a new account to support \u2018Drunk For Her\u2019 from the shadows. So, do not think that \u2018Drunk For Her\u2019 was a good author, just because he had earned a few Sect Masters in a particular book. In reality, Zhao Youyue had been singularly responsible for it all!</p><br/><p>\u2018Drunk For Her\u2019 thought that he had become a God. Little did he know that Zhao Youyue had tried to compensate him by going around, reading groups and promoting him, asking them to give \u2018Drunk For Her\u2019 a High God level. He could have become a High God five years ago, but she had ruined it all!</p><br/><p>This was the future. It was the milestone on the road to cultivation for \u2018Drunk For Her.\u2019 To Lady Zhao, however, it was just a trivial matter.</p><br/><p>Later, \u2018Drunk For Her\u2019 somehow learned of the truth. Perhaps it came to him in the form of a revelating dream. He might have even lost his mind from all the criticism of the book, \u2018Shift! The Female Elite Scholar\u2019. Therefore, after writing more than 1.4 million words in this book, after laying out so many words, it was just to tell the readers the truth \u2013</p><br/><p>It was not his fault at first. He had grown arrogant. Of course, everything was actually Zhao Youyue\u2019s fault. Of course, the missy was too kind. She had tried to compensate him discreetly.</p></div>\n</div>"}

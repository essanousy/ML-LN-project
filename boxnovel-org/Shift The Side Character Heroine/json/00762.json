Otherwise, these three punks would not be so arrogant. Most importantly was Yuan Shawu\u2019s safety, the little beauty who looked so helpless and fragile.</p><br/><p>Luo Chen shot Yuan Shawu a look, hoping that she would leave and act as if she did not know him. Better not drag her into this\u2026</p><br/><p>However, the last thing Luo Chen expected was for Yuan Shawu to stride up to them and start talking!</p><br/><p>The leader was Zhang Jun, and he preferred to be called \u201cBrother Jun.\u201d Brother Jun was not the most powerful school bully in this low-grade high school, but he could pack a punch. He was not interested in \u201cThe Highest Seat.\u201d Instead, he\u2019d rather bully orphans like Luo Chen who were not protected by any parents nor teachers. He could do as he pleased!</p><br/><p>Yes, even the low-grade high school had students with good grades. With some effort, one might be able to make it into the first class. Only the top 30 ranked students were entitled to the benefits of the second class. It was a typical grading system.</p><br/><p>Students with good grades and were willing to learn would enjoy adequate protection from their teachers. Luo Chen was neither good academically, neither did he have a powerful family behind him. He was destined to be an easy target.</p><br/><p>Brother Jun, with a cigarette in his mouth, led his two younger punks and stood in Luo Chen\u2019s way. As usual, he was expecting some pocket money from Luo Chen. He knew that poor students like Luo Chen had subsidies. As long as Luo Chen did not die of hunger, the rest of his money should be paid as \u201cprotection money\u201d!</p><br/><p>But before Brother Jun could say a word, Yuan Shawu spoke up. \u201cWho the hell are you? Why are you in the way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Shawu\u2019s tone was unkind, but her eyes were a little excited. All the schools she went to in real life were well-disciplined and orderly. With her strong family background and status as the golden child of the teachers, it was impossible for her to encounter yobs. Even if an ignorant one came across her, her hulking bodyguards would make quick work of him. She never had to get her hands dirty.</p><br/><p>Even with the \u201cAnonymous Lady Su\u201d card, Lady Zhao had not had many chances to use her sword\u2026 As for her habit of holding a gem scepter in her hand, it was nothing but a display of power.</p><br/><p>She was now an ordinary high school student in a low-grade school. In the dark age of yobs, she could finally let loose and live her dream!</p><br/><p>Perhaps Zhao Youyue habitually held the scepter so often, that she would never leave her house without something in her hand. Today, she held a long umbrella. By holding a \u201csword\u201d in her hand, she felt invincible!</p><br/><p>Brother Jun\u2019s only intention was to claim his routine fees from Luo Chen. Luo Chen was at the bottom part of a food pyramid. He could not possibly be related to any pretty girls, only the ugly ones\u2026</p><br/><p>Brother Jun still had not found himself a girlfriend. Only a blind girl would fall in love with a punk. Since there were highly influential punks around, such as the one seated in \u201cthe highest chair,\u201d why would any girl still come for some small fry like him?</p><br/><p>Yes, in this low-grade high school, there was a true tyrant in the school, with various legends surrounding him. Most importantly was his handsome face and charm. He was also good in academics. With such a specimen at the top of the food chain, most of the other punks quickly lost their interest in pursuing anything.</p><br/><p>Brother Jun looked like a monster as he shifted his sights to Yuan Shawu. What he saw terrified him!</p><br/><p>When did their school earn another beautiful female student!</p><br/><p>High school students like Brother Jun paid little attention to their studies. Naturally, they preferred talking about those beautiful girls in school. For example, the \u201cfour prettiest school flowers\u201d that only appeared in novels. It was all made up by people who were bored like them.</p><br/><p>But there was no doubt that these \u201cbig four school flowers\u201d existed. Even so, they were merely beautiful on the outside, as their pathetic worshipers surrounded them in school.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, low-grade schools were always full of pretty girls. These pretty girls were probably so proud of their statuses, that they have lost focus on their studies and lost the opportunity to enroll in a good school.</p><br/><p>Every year, it was a typical scene for students to get expelled from the school because of pregnancy. Even though it was explicitly forbidden to start a relationship, nobody could stop the underground burrowing. Burrow too hard, and safeguards would fail.</p><br/><p>Of course, when it came to low-graded high schools that lack disciplinary practices, the abortion rate would be significantly higher. Not every student could be involved in such a thing. Only the pretty ones could treat the relationship as a game. There was a nickname given to those girls with their own hidden agenda in a relationship. They were called \u201cGreen Tea Bitches.\u201d</p><br/><p>The top ranking Green Tea Bitches was often single, as once they were involved in a relationship, they would lose a lot of followers and along with it, the sensation of being worshipped as a goddess. Therefore, they would mostly flirt and fool around with those gifts they received unconditionally. Some even refused to have sexual intercourse before marriage. If they did so, their market value would have dropped exponentially.</p><br/><p>No matter how open-minded society had grown, most men preferred having virgins before their marriages. It was not a necessity, but if their wife was a virgin, that was a great bonus!</p><br/><p>A brilliant Green Tea Bitch could have countless followers. She would remain a virgin because she was never in a serious relationship. If one was truly in love with her, why could he not wait until they were married to have sexual intercourse; they would prove one\u2019s responsibility towards the girl\u2019s well-being.</p><br/><p>When he saw Yuan Shawu, brother Jun immediately wiped the monster off his face. A gorgeous lady could turn any male into a meek lamb, including hooligan like Brother Jun. He picked up a far gentler tone and said, \u2018Hi pretty, he is the one that we are trying to stop, you may leave now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Luo Chen was literally squeezing the cold sweat out of his pores when Yuan Shawu had barked at those notorious yobs. What happened next baffled him even more. Zhang Jun actually went easy on her. Indeed, life could turn out smooth sailing, if you happened to be good looking.</p><br/><p>However, Yuan Shawu did not buy Zhang Jun\u2019s gentleness for a moment. She straightened her back an got even closer to him. \u2018Who do you think you are to stop him, he is a friend of mine. Buzz off!\u2019 Luo Chen turned into a statue.</p><br/><p>Why is she trying to make things worse?!</p></div>\n</div>"}

From her opinion as a gold digger, those rich men out there, especially those who liked her work were definitely the good sort of people. Actually she wanted to ask his opinions on her new book, and also to find out his preference on manga styles. Perhaps she would be lucky enough and received a huge tip from him\u2026</p><br/><p>Therefore, the two made an appointment to meet five days before Chinese New Year. It was winter break for Zhao Youyue, during which she would return to her old house with her parents to celebrate this festive season. They usually went back a day before Chinese New Year\u2019s Eve. The old house was built in a rich town by the mountains, and they had to offer sacrifices to their ancestors in the mountains as well. Every Chinese New year, they had a complete set of procedures for the ancestral ceremony.</p><br/><p>To be honest, Zhao Youyue disliked the traditional ceremony. She thought of it as a mere feudal superstition. But for sure, she would not mind that as long as she was allowed to play with her phone. The internet signal was still good in town so she could use it to her heart\u2019s content.</p><br/><p>To Zhao Youyue, was there a difference of where she could play with her phone?</p><br/><p>Traveling was just to play with her phone in another place!</p><br/><p>Her old house was very comfortable, equipped with air conditioners, heaters, computers and internet etc. The breeze here was even cleaner and fresher than the city. Besides of not having the busy shopping districts and 3D cinemas, her old house was a place to live comfortably.</p><br/><p>The whole town was practically a mah-jong town; almost the whole street was full of mahjong schools. They would organize a mahjong league at any time. Her grandfather Zhao Rongchun was a mahjong lover, but he was terrible at it. The more rotten he was in playing mahjong, he loved the game even more.</p><br/><p>Her grandfather had two sons and a daughter. Her father Zhao Jiayi as the younger son, was not doing so well since he was only a director of a private hospital. On the other hand, the eldest son Zhao Jiaren was the CEO of a famous listing technology company while holding shares of other popular web-based companies. Moreover, he was also a shareholder in Tencent and one of the directors in Douyu live platform. You could say that he was a business tycoon. As for the daughter, she was married to the mayor of a prefecture-level city where the economy was booming. As a wife to the mayor, she was immersed in glory and fame, not to mention, she was also the Vice President of a bank in that city.</p><br/><p>Judging from Zhao Youyue\u2019s family background, for sure they were no match to those superfamilies who had incredible influences, billions of assets or had governors as their errand boys. However, it was questionable whether such family ever existed in the first place. In any case, when being compared to civilians, the superiority of her wealthy background was more than enough, after all her surname was \u201cZhao\u201d.</p><br/><p>Every year, Zhao Youyue received tons of red packets from her uncles and aunties, allowing her to gain the highest amount of pocket money. Thus, she had a favourable impression towards her father\u2019s biological siblings.</p><br/><p>The semester finals on Tuesday had finally arrived. The moment Zhao Youyue entered the school, she had activated \u201cXu Jing\u2019s possession\u201d mode. However, she was not contented with the growth of her shoulder-length hair. She felt that she could only be at her best with the ponytail hairstyle, after all Xu Jing\u2019s character had that hairstyle.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Zhao Youyue had decided to keep her hair long. Short hair was indeed pretty, but it could not be compared to when she had long hair. The most suitable hairstyle for her would always be black and straight. That was her instinct, or her remaining male aesthetic that resided within her. Black and straight hair was the best and the most perfect hair for her!</p><br/><p>Still, it took time to grow your hair. Of course, extra care was needed upon growing your hair. If you were not confidence in your hair\u2019s quality, then it would be better to just leave it as it was.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue took good care of both her skin and hair since her childhood. As her mother was one who so loved to play with her daughter, of course she would make sure Youyue grow up to be fair, tender and beautiful. As time passed, Zhao Youyue had learned to take care of her own body. She would never apply harmful products, and would definitely look for care products that were reliable and beneficial, regardless of how expensive they could be. Then she would use them continuously since she was filthy rich.</p><br/><p>In this day and age, the men has terrible taste. All they love to see is women on the internet or those who only look beautiful with makeup. As for the same-age peers, they set their gaze upon the girls with better academic results, bigger breasts, and multi talents, or even their Onee [1] teachers. Girls like Zhao Youyue who wore loose sport pajamas all year round and kept a short hair would become a side character, though she truly was a rich and gorgeous girl. Only a few had perceived her as the most beautiful girl in the class, or even the whole school. Her understated beauty was actually a feast for the eyes, but only those with sharp eyes could discover this true beauty of hers.</p><br/><p>In any case, starting from the next semester, Zhao Youyue should be able to change her hairstyle from bob to single ponytail if everything went well. Maybe the number of people who could see her beauty would increase, as her long hair suited her better, even if it was just a ponytail braid.</p><br/><p>In reality, she was also gradually becoming the supporting character with a little sense of existence who used to be a side character who had no sense of presence at all.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Youyue was slightly nervous before the language exam even though she was in \u201cXu Jing\u2019s possession\u201d mode. This was because she was cramming for her exam. If she had gotten the character card of Xu Jing half a semester earlier, she would not have to worry about examinations. She kept thinking that there were some contents that she had not revised. Those ancient poems that needed to be memorised was not sticking in her head either. She was afraid her mind would just go blank in the middle of the exam.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was so worried up to the extent that after taking her stationery, she was still flipping through the language textbooks a few more times during her walk to class 7, which was the exam hall. She wanted to glance through those contents a few more times, thinking they might be questioned in the exam. She regretted that she did not work harder beforehand. Besides, she had possessed these kind of thoughts was mainly because she was in Xu Jing\u2019s possession mode. If it was the normal Zhao Youyue, she definitely would not have this kind of reflection on her studies and herself\u2026</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue was walking to class 7, she realized most of the students from class 7 had not left and all she could do was to wait outside the classroom. To her surprise, she found out that her old classmate Han Leng, was in the same exam hall as her. The latter was leaning against the railing of the second floor. With his eyes having thick dark circles underneath closed, he seemed to be filled with divined aura like always.</p><br/><p>After seeing him, Zhao Youyue took the initiative and walked towards him. She greeted him with an expressionless face, \u201cHan Leng, were you training to be an immortal again last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>She wanted to smile in the first place, but don\u2019t forget that she was in \u201cXu Jing\u2019s possession\u201d mode. Therefore, her facial paralysis was giving off a strong aura.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Onee () is a kind of Moe personality in manga and anime. It refers to matured female characters with the appearance and character of an elder sister.</p>\n</div>"}

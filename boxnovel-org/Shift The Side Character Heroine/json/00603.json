People had even suspected that he had created a sub-account to hate on the celebrity. He had to jump onto his main account to settle everything; even stating that he was not that interested in the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao blamed such events on fate. A few years ago, he hoped that he would become as famous as Ding Yunchong and start a \u201cNational Daddy\u201d thing, but Ding Yunchong had outshone him in everything, from fame to investing in e-sports.</p><br/><p>Eventually, he mellowed down and stopped trying to be famous, but many on the net had already learned that many of his fans had been bought. Even so, his WeiBo was still rather active.</p><br/><p>He even gained a level of fame, with everyone calling him \u201cNational Uncle\u201d or something like that. It was not his fault that he had Ah Yu as his sister. It was not his fault that Ah Yu and Zhao Youyue were so likable.</p><br/><p>People online have done the impossible. Zhao Youyue\u2019s background privacy was almost bulletproof, ranging from her parents to what they did for a living, to Zhao Hao\u2019s actual worth, down to his private planes and yachts. Even so, nobody ever got a definite answer, and speculations have been proven to be utterly inaccurate.</p><br/><p>However, everyone agreed on one point. Zhao Youyue\u2019s father and Zhao Hao\u2019s father seemed to be brothers. Nobody knew what they did for a living, but they were highly certain that they were part of the Zhao Family.</p><br/><p>Such a discovery indeed made Zhao Youyue seem much more of a Milady than before, but if Zhao Youyue was a relative, what sort of relative would she be, really?</p><br/><p>So, Zhao Youyue was Zhao Hao\u2019s cousin, and even the famed Prince Ding Yunchong bowed to her. She became more famous than ever. Theorycrafters got to work and created conspiracy theories regarding her status, making her seem like one of those hidden elites. As web novels increased in amount, so did the damage to the brain of the typical netizen.</p><br/><p>In reality, Zhao Youyue was a passerby among the Zhao Family. Even she was unsure about her own position. One thing was certain. Earning the respect of the wealthy Zhao Hao made Zhao Youyue a true milady. Miladies were not passers-by.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao\u2019s own fame was in no small part due to Zhao Youyue\u2019s fame. He no longer made an effort to stand out, but this unintentional fame still brought him much good.</p><br/><p>However, being called the \u201cNational Uncle\u201d did not please him at all. His sister was so perfect, but everyone out there was thinking that they could be his brother-in-law.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not even talk about the online fans. He did not even think that the other \u201cprinces\u201d from his social circle were worthy. Good luck getting along with his sister. He even agreed that he changed from being an unreliable brother into the head of a company, which was mostly due to his sister.</p><br/><p>There was a kind of person in the world who rubbed off you as spent time with them. Zhao Youyue was such a person. Su Li, Bai Yunshan, Han Leng had all been transformed by her light.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao and the racer head Chen Yilong often butted heads; Zhao Youyue being one of the reasons.</p><br/><p>Calling Chen Yilong a Prince would be an understatement. He was the grandson of the Gambling God of Macau. The Chen family of Macau was exceptionally well known, known primarily for opening the most well-known casino in Macau, owning a luxurious cruise ship that doubled as a floating casino. Only billionaires had the privilege of stepping on board it.</p><br/><p>Their first collision literally happened with a car crash in Hong Kong involving an Aston Martin one77, a five-of-a-kind car. That car had belonged to Chen Yilong. Zhao Hao and himself were equally skilled in racing \u2013 so to speak. They had the dexterity and maneuverability of bulls. Hitting random cars was just a past time for them.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao owned a factory in Macau, so bumping into Chen Lilong was inevitable, much to his chagrin. He did not like that man, he was just the right combination of wealth and intelligence to pose a threat. He had been able to help his family out, even when he was still studying. Apparently, he had also been picked as the God of Gambling\u2019s successor.</p><br/><p>Whenever the older generations from Zhao Hao\u2019s family chastised him, they would always mention Chen Yilong, much to his annoyance.</p><br/><p>To make matters worst, Chen Yilong was annoyingly handsome. Zhao Hao had always been confident in his looks, but he knew in his heart that standing beside Chen Yilong made him look like a mud cake.</p><br/><p>Chen Yilong was what many girls wished for; an overbearing, male protagonist who was waiting for the arrival of his female protagonist, only to tell her that she had won his heart.</p><br/><p>This female protagonist must be short and dumb, just enough to be sweet. That was the only way he could exercise his overbearing presence.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao was most infuriated at how Chen Yilong bugged Zhao Youyue. That egotistical bastard had claimed that him wanting Zhao Youyue\u2019s contact information out of the blue was more than enough proof that he had feelings for her. He had even revealed the reward money prepared just for her; over 10,000,000 RMB!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe money is not much, but it should show you how sincere I am!\u201d Chen Yilong had said to the Lady.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you fell for my sister at first sight!\u201d Zhao Hao had roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course that\u2019s not it. I just find her favorable. It\u2019s such a shame. I have already prepared so much money for her, yet I still lack her contact number. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here now. No matter what, we are friends, right? Throw me a bone, will ya?\u201d Chen Yilong had smiled warmly. Zhao Hao was unable to deny that this bastard had dazzling charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet away from me! Who would be friends with you?!\u201d Zhao Hao had snapped, \u201cMy sister is, in fact, a hardworking genius unlike you. A Milady like her won\u2019t even glance at your wealth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA milady huh? I can understand your love for her, but you are being paranoid. Old Ding can enjoy meals with the both of you, so why can\u2019t I? I want a sister too\u2026\u201d Chen Yilong flashed his brilliant white teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust shut up\u2026 Old Ding is safe, you aren\u2019t. What if you put my sister in danger? Look at all the girls you\u2019ve sullied and tossed aside. You\u2019re not even willing to clean up after your mess!\u201d Zhao Hao barked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I was left with no choice. It is not my fault that I started getting into guys. The world has simply run out of girls worthy of my touch!\u201d Chen Yilong said, maintaining his charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling you a piece of shit! Picking up chicks to the left and right even if you have a newfound love for guys. Telling them the truth after they have fallen for you, destroying their trust in men. Such a barbarian!\u201d Zhao Hao could barely contain his anger.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Chen Yilong may be extremely handsome, but he was into men. Even so, he would still go around, picking up chicks. That was probably why he could remain so poised and composed around girls, pretending to be the protagonist of some kind of shoujo manga, the kind that girls would die for. If such a character existed in real life, they would be a flytrap for girls.</p><br/><p>Due to this sexual orientation, Chen Yilong had long been thought to be pure and clean. He was nothing like the filthy rich princes Zhao Hao and Ding Yunchong. He never bedded any of the girls he picked up, but left them in disappointment all the same. \u201cFlowing winds that do not flow down, multiple feelings yet never making use of any.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many girls had the confidence of conquering such guys, only to find that they had been played the fool. Even if they got a boyfriend after that, they would still be unable to forget Chen Yilong, the perfect lover.</p><br/><p>His homosexuality was just the tip of the iceberg. He had more shocking revelations to offer. His boyfriend was Xia Hai, a mountain racer. With Chen Yilong\u2019s help, he had built up his fame in the underground racing community.</p><br/><p>Chen Yilong\u2019s probably loved racing so much, only due to his boyfriend. He had never missed a single one of his races. Sometimes, he rode shotgun for a shot of adrenaline. Of course, if an accident were to occur, they might die together, and that was beauty in itself.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, Zhao Hao would be envious of Chen Yilong. That man had such a skilled racer by his side. He could get his daily fix of adrenaline whenever he felt like it. On the other hand, Zhao Hao could not even get a semi-decent racer on his side. If he attempted to drive himself, it would end up in a multi-billion dollar crash, as always.</p><br/><p>This often left Zhao Hao highly embarrassed. Every time when he attended a race, he would feel as if he had lost to Chen Yilong by default.</p><br/><p>Chen Yilong was also displeased with how protective Zhao Hao was over his sister. As a result, their regular butting of heads escalated into fierce rivalry; and like men, they decided to settle it all with a race.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Zhao Hao had lost. During a dinner with Zhao Youyue, he drank just a little too much and spilled the beans. He even expressed how sorry he was for treating his own sister as a chip and losing in the end.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue heard that, she merely blinked in confusion. \u201cLosing her? Was this a new trend?\u201d she thought.</p><br/><p>Soon after, she finally learned that as part of the deal, he had been forced to meet her up with Chen Yilong. Somehow, Zhao Hao did not mention anything about Chen Yilong\u2019s sexual orientation. He only said how Chen Yilong liked to toy with female hearts but not their bodies, and warned his sister not to be fooled by appearances.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not believe that such pure, rich boy lovers existed in reality. Wasn\u2019t this a thing of fiction?</p><br/><p>\u201cNii-san, since you lost, how about I help you win it all back? Let me tell you a secret. I can race myself, you know?\u201d Zhao Youyue beamed, confident as always. With her new character card, what was there to be afraid of?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You can drive?\u201d Zhao Hao received a great shock.</p><br/><p>Translation Notes:</p><br/><p>[1] An Indian god.</p></div>\n</div>"}

She decided not to take things too far with two girls, not only because Geralt was there, but also because of their identities as Princesses of Cintra.</p><br/><p>Eithn\u00e9 did not intend to become mortal enemies with a human kingdom.</p><br/><p>So, she chose to entertain the two princesses and Geralt. She also claimed that the girls had earned their place here, as they had drunk the Water of Brokilon. However, their fate was in their own hands.</p><br/><p>Olivia realized that the Dryads of the Brokilon Forest had been converted into a friendly force. The spot on the map that was originally yellow had turned green. On the other hand, enemies would marked down as red dots.</p><br/><p>Both Olivia and Cirilla chose to leave the Brokilon Forest with Geralt. Such a green life in the forest was rather peaceful, but such idyllic pastoralism would turn boring with the passage of time.</p><br/><p>Besides, Cirilla\u2019s perception of Geralt has finally changed. Prior to this, she had been left without a direction, but she now had a clear goal \u2014- \u2014- she and her sister could follow Geralt and become witchers!</p><br/><p>She started warming up to him before throwing out that request. It was also time to try putting her little sister back in line. She used to allow Olivia\u2019s especially disrespectful and rude behavior. Olivia had always referred to Geralt as \u201cThe White Wolf\u201d and showed him no respect.</p><br/><p>Actually, Geralt was more comfortable talking to Olivia. He told Olivia of how his signs gained power ever since using the \u201cFoglet Decoction.\u201d His teacher, Vesemir, was shocked and said that Geralt had been extremely fortunate. For witchers, every new discovery of a decoction would greatly improve their combat effectiveness.</p><br/><p>Decoctions that increased the intensity of signs allowed witchers to deal with troublesome monsters whose weaknesses were magic, via the fire Igni sign.</p><br/><p>Olivia\u2019s forthcoming attitude was easy and comfortable. Geralt appreciated this rare opportunity to be transparent, minus the airs, the falsehoods. He also found Olivia\u2019s \u201cuncoordinated body-oral syndrome\u201d to be extremely cute.</p><br/><p>However, whenever he interacted with Cirilla who was bound to him by the \u201cLaw of Surprise,\u201d he could not fully be himself. This was not because he was biased, but because he cared too much about Cirilla. He always felt that he had an enormous responsibility, and he was afraid that he might not live up to it.</p><br/><p>Previously, whenever Geralt met up with Cirilla, he had the right to take her away, but he did not. Now, she had basically run into his arms. This \u201cLaw of Surprise\u201d was truly full of surprises.</p><br/><p>He was too kind to force people into a role they did not want.</p><br/><p>However, as the saying went, \u201cIf heaven gives you something and you refuse to accept it, you are a heretic.\u201d If Geralt refuses to take Cirilla away again and again, it might just subject Cirilla to more misfortune as they were deliberately going against the \u201cLaw of Surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Geralt brought the two of them out of the Brokilon Forest, he decided to reveal his history to Cirilla, and this included the part about her father.</p><br/><p>In her heart, Cirilla had already decided to would follow Geralt together with her sister. At least, her future would not be filled with uncertainty anymore.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, Druid Ermion effortless found the three of them. He certainly lived up to his fame. Nobody should mess with those who were proficient in Gwent.</p><br/><p>As someone who had dispelled Duny\u2019s curse alongside Geralt previously, Ermion naturally knew about the \u201cLaw of Surprise\u201d between Geralt and Cirilla. After they had an awkward, silent face-off, he sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just here to take Olivia back. I hope that you can take Cirilla with you, Geralt. You meeting her again this time was an arrangement of fate. You don\u2019t have to worry about Calanthe; I\u2019ll keep her off your throat.\u201d</p><br/><p>A druid like Ermion would be a firm believer in fate. He used the \u201cIf you deny her her destiny, you would only bring misfortune upon her\u201d card.</p><br/><p>Geralt made up his mind instantly. However, after Cirilla heard that Ermion was going to take Olivia back, she became highly anxious. She gritted her teeth and said firmly, \u201cI will not be separated from my sister. I will go wherever she goes. If he wants to take me away, then take my sister along.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the perfect choice in Cirilla\u2019s eyes. However, Ermion was very persistent about bringing Olivia back. After all, there was no \u201cLaw of Surprise\u201d between Olivia and Geralt. Leaving the little Princess Olivia to the wild would be dangerous.</p><br/><p>Moreover, since Calanthe had asked Ermion to find Olivia and Cirilla, he definitely could not return completely empty-handed. Wouldn\u2019t he disappoint Calanthe, who trusted him so?</p><br/><p>Once again, Geralt left without hesitation. He was not going to take Cirilla away from the sister she loved so dearly. He still did not think that Cirilla would be happier if she followed him, compared to her living her life as a noble Princess of Cintra. Allowing a girl to become a witcher was beyond callous.</p><br/><p>Misfortune? Following him would be a misfortune, as opposed to living in the castle. Just a while ago, Cirilla had mistakenly entered the Brokilon Forest, but she had walked away from it the same. She even became an honorable guest of Queen Eithn\u00e9.</p><br/><p>Olivia surveyed the entire scene in silence. Wherever Cirilla was, she would also be there.</p><br/><p>In her opinion, Cirilla helping her escape from the marriage this time was just a fun game. She did not expect Cirilla\u2019s reckless decision to actually yield results. Ermion had foiled their escape, but this meant nothing to her.</p><br/><p>War was approaching. There was no time for the engagement ceremony. If Cintra Kingdom falls, then the marriage contract between her and the Prince of Kistrin would mean nothing.</p><br/><p>When Olivia and Cirilla were brought back, it was already Spring, and temperatures rose, which also heralded the Nilfgaardian Empire\u2019s coming!</p><br/><p>Calanthe did not have the time or energy to scold those two troublemakers. Instead, together with her husband Eist, they personally led the army and charged forward!</p><br/><p>Calanthe never once slowed!</p><br/><p>Calanthe confidently charged forward!</p><br/><p>Calanthe played a GG!</p><br/><p>This clash became known as the \u201cBattle of Marnadal.\u201d The Cintran forces met the Nilfgaardian army. Both Eist Tuirseach and Calanthe, King and Queen of Cintra, participated in the battle.</p><br/><p>When the Cintran army reached the Marnadal Valley, they found themselves surrounded by an overwhelmingly larger army of Nilfgaard.</p><br/><p>The Cintran army bravely held them back, even though the chances of winning were slim. They fought day and night. Eventually, the Cintran forces became overwhelmed by numbers and was almost wiped out.</p><br/><p>King Eist Tuirseach fell in battle, while Queen Calanthe gathered the remaining troops and fled to Cintra.</p><br/><p>Obviously, this was a turning point in history. All of Calanthe\u2019s efforts in the past few years have all gone up in smoke. The Cintran army\u2019s morale was all but extinguished.</p></div>\n</div>"}

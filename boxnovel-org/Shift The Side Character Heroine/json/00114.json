It became a short bobbed hair once again, similar to that of Katou Megumi.</p><br/><p>The reason was that Zhao Youyue did not want her \u201ctwintail-fetish\u201d mom to mess around with her hair. During the times she kept her hair long, she noticed how troublesome it was to take good care of her hair, not to mention that it was a waste of her precious time to play her phone\u2026</p><br/><p>After much consideration, Zhao Youyue decided to cut her hair short, like the typical student hairstyle. She wanted to spend more time studying without wasting any minutes. Oh and not to mention, she had also picked up her violin lessons again, attending it a couple of times a week, during night hours.</p><br/><p>This reason was impeccable, it rendered Wang Hua speechless though she was so eager to show off her skills of making twintail.</p><br/><p>In this school, apart from school holidays, students were only free for a brief period during the Sunday afternoons. But since Zhao Youyue did not have to attend night classes, she would utilize her free time to learn violin. Of course, she would not use up her weekend to do so. If she needed to attend violin lessons during night hours, she would need to finish her homework first, or she would be doing her homework after lessons.</p><br/><p>Looking from different perspectives, high school students were no longer advisable to pick up an instrument unless she was an art student. But then, Zhao Youyue was just a regular high school student.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was confident that she could be persistent this time with the help of \u201cXu Jing\u2019s card\u201d.</p><br/><p>After cutting her hair short, she had once again lost her sense of presence which was gained by her ponytail hairstyle.</p><br/><p>Well, it did mean that Zhao Youyue would be ignored by others, but on the contrary, her in-class influences and sense of presence were gradually increasing.</p><br/><p>This was because she achieved pretty decent results from her last year\u2019s final exam, she made it to the 7th place among her classmates. Mr. Qiu was praising her when school reopened, he thought that she was the student who had developed the fastest progress. Anyhow, she has become one of the top ten students in class after midterm, and this was definitely worth praising.</p><br/><p>Mr. Qiu thought that Zhao Youyue indeed had a proper attitude towards learning as he had always seen Zhao Youyue learning by herself quietly without disturbing others. Of course, he definitely had forgotten that he once caught Zhao Youyue playing her phone at the beginning of the semester.</p><br/><p>Even if he remembered, he would not despise Zhao Youyue anymore, and would only think that Zhao Youyue had corrected her mistakes after submitting an apology letter, and of course, she did it\u2026</p><br/><p>Mr. Qiu even believed that Zhao Youyue was a great example of following the school\u2019s regulations as she had never worn any unusual or branded clothing, other than her typical school uniform.</p><br/><p>Han Leng who was sitting in the back row, twitched his mouth when he first learned about Zhao Youyue\u2019s modest personality. She was indeed \u201cmodest\u201d to have spent hundreds of cash just to hire someone to write her an apology letter. In addition to that, she was rather modest in the way she spent thousands on a mug or even a bag, not to mention that she could tip any author a Sect Master on Qidian. On top of that, she even knew the infamous amateur king mangaka Su Li in person. They had always been seen hanging out in a limo with a personal driver</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, Han Leng had known that the Tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d was Lady Zhao Youyue herself, that super-tycoon level account, \u201cImYouyueHerBrother\u201d was in her hands too.</p><br/><p>He did not remember all of that by himself or gaining information directly from Zhao Youyue. He knew it by seeing a photo of Zhao Youyue in the \u201cBest Gaming Authors\u201d group.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Rosemary did not put his Silver cum Golden Sect Master, Zhao Youyue in display, but that did not mean that the other authors were not showing off. There was this author who had a gaming channel, called \u201cLoveEatingStrawberries\u201d, who had joined the \u201cElderly Lone Club\u201d as well. There was once he simply flaunted the photos he had saved in the authors\u2019 group, which were none other than the photos of Zhao Youyue and Su Li</p><br/><p>Tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d was this pretty and rich despite being a high school student. You are lucky will she ever be interested in your books. A Sect Master reward was a piece of cake to her, as she could even spare a Silver Sect Master reward if you were able to coax her well. Just look at the Q coins in \u201cImYouyueHerBrother\u2019s\u201d account. This amount could never be afforded by any other readers.</p><br/><p>Han Leng seldom spoke in the authors\u2019 group. However, this did not mean he was one of the Godly authors, who usually loved to keep a low profile. But whenever he was free, he would still peek in the group, watching the other authors showing off. Upon seeing Zhao Youyue\u2019s photo, he could not help but to send a message to the group, \u201cHey I know this girl! She\u2019s my classmate, I even helped her write an apology letter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng certainly did not expect that Tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d was Zhao Youyue, after recalling his thoughts, he realized this definitely suited Lady Zhao because she was always the modest person he knew.</p><br/><p>After sending the message, the other authors were also showing off that they knew Zhao Youyue personally, their neighbor\u2019s kid, relative\u2019s kid or whatsoever\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Leng rolled his eyes and ignored these authors who did not believe in him. He then clicked on Zhao Youyue\u2019s reader profile. He thought that Zhao Youyue was the person who certainly had her own taste because the online literatures she had tipped were not some hollow literatures. As a matter of fact, he did not misjudge Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>It looked like he could not continue writing his hollow literature, \u201cConquer the world within online games\u201d. If Zhao Youyue found out about this, even though she would not mention anything, but she would definitely look down on him. So he decided to learn from the books that Zhao Youyue tipped.</p><br/><p>What made him the happiest was that Zhao Youyue had liked \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d as well, simply because he loved this book too! He thought he shared a common language with Zhao Youyue\u2026</p><br/><p>Because of her vast improvement and good results, Zhao Youyue was unafraid when she was invited on stage to share her experience. Her learning experience was gained through \u201cXu Jing\u2019s card\u201d. Although she did not enjoy learning at first, but with the help of that card, studying became the most enjoyable experience in the whole world. Therefore, she recommended her classmates to treat studying as their true love in order to enjoy their studies, and claimed that it was nothing better than falling in love with studying.</p><br/><p>Their homeroom teacher Mr. Qiu smiled, feeling that the speech given by this hardworking and modest Zhao Youyue had given a spiritual speech. Of course, if anyone wanted to get into an early relationship, they could pick learning as their target. Therefore, he personally supported the idea of getting addicted to learning!</p><br/><p>Upon watching the interactions between the two of them, all students in the classroom had given them the finger in their hearts\u2026</p><br/><p>After the school was over, the hardworking yet modest Lady Zhao who mentioned that \u201cenjoy studying, addicted to studying\u201d, began promoting the novel \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d to boost its popularity.</p><br/><p>Passing by Zhao Youyue intentionally, Han Leng overheard her talking about \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d. He had that sudden urge to talk, \u201cRosemary\u2019s \u2018The Strongest King\u2019? I personally think the book is just ok\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean just ok? Just how high are your standards, Han Leng?\u201d Zhao Youyue said it with dissatisfaction all over her face.</p>\n</div>"}

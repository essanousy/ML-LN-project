When Chen Haoran realizes that once again, his feeling is one-sided, he should move on like before. So he only needs Chen Haoran to know that \u201cHan Bing\u201d did not have a crush on him.</p><br/><p>But this would all depend on Han Leng, as he was an extremely loyal \u2018brother\u2019. In order to save Chen Haoran from further despair, he would probably maintain the white lie\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Leng had decided to come to Zhao Youyue for this, as he knew that she was a great listener. That grumpy temperament of his would be gone when talking to her; she would always respond with a soothing calmness.</p><br/><p>After getting the approval of Han Leng, Zhao Youyue had posted his \u201cfemale photos\u201d in the chat group; the readers were getting impatient because Leng Zi had not fulfilled his promise.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had made it a point to explicitly state that Leng Zi was a male author, but the readers were not having any of it! The photos of Leng Zi that were posted by \u201cTycoon Youyue\u201d caused an uproar in the chat group!</p><br/><p>\u201cI certainly did not expect Master Leng Zi to be such a beauty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a beautiful high school student, and \u2018Tycoon Youyue\u2019 is saying that she a guy? I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop lying, this is definitely a girl, why do you want to be a reverse-trap? Are you drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom this day onward, I am a loyal slave of Master Leng Zi, whoever who dares oppose Master Leng Zi, I shall crush his head!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give up on avenging Chu Luoxun after seeing the photos of Master Leng Zi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Youyue you\u2019re amazing, you could always make friends with the authors, I envy your contact list!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Leng Zi\u2019s legs are life-threatening, eh, how did my screen get dirty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolute territory was great, prprpr[1]\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue realized that gender did not matter when the end result looks good. Look at all these testosterone-fueled male readers!</p><br/><p>How would they react when they learn of Leng Zi\u2019s true gender? They might not believe now, but this was the fact!</p><br/><p>Han Leng would not possibly wear his female outfit to meet his fans. The magazine company would surely build him up as a (male) idol to sell his books better.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not post the photos onto Weibo, but that did not mean that others would do the same. Without a doubt, Han Leng\u2019s photo became a trending result in Weibo\u2019s search bar. \u201cBeautiful April\u201d was still a hot topic in Weibo; there were a lot of \u201caestheticians\u201d who dwelled on the topic\u2026</p><br/><p>The original songs from \u201cBeautiful April\u201d themselves became popular. Unfortunately, there was no actual melody or music to represent them. If that were the case, the \u201caestheticians\u201d would analyze Chu Luoxun\u2019s thoughts from the music, down to every syllable and pause.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the rumor of Master Leng Zi being a beautiful female author had been proven. Without a doubt, it was an encouraging piece of news, people were more willing to forgive a beautiful author these days, Su Li excluded.</p><br/><p>Even though Su Li was a good looking mangaka, she loved to gossip, appear on headlines and stir up controversy, which only caused more readers to frame her. Her fame was already more than what her abilities were capable of, but her strength as a painter was the real deal, she was just not as good at thinking up a story.</p><br/><p>Besides that, how Su Li despised pirated readers and how she worshipped tycoon readers left a great many disgruntled about her. According to statistics, the pirated readers would usually be ten times more than the readers who supported the original\u2026</p><br/><p>So, it made sense as to why Su Li would often get framed; she gave people the impression that she would bow down to any rich beneficiary.</p><br/><p>Master Leng Zi was a mysteriously low profile author, and had unintentionally caused a stir. With everyone wanting to know who \u201cshe\u201d actually was, her name was also a frequent hit in search engines. Now that \u201cher\u201d photos have circulated around the internet, everyone decided to forgive \u201cher\u201d!</p><br/><p>Such a beautiful female author could easily appease the grudge of the crowd by exposing \u201cher\u201d photos, so that everyone could rest easy and shift the blame to Su Li. Everything was Su Li\u2019s fault, under the mysterious influence, it made Master Leng Zi kill Chu Luoxun in the novel\u2026</p><br/><p>One must admit that Master Leng Zi was brave, because \u201cshe\u201d was willing to apologize and take responsibility, \u201cshe\u201d had won the readers\u2019 favor, the readers could also sense the remorse and heartache of Master Leng Zi as \u201cshe\u201d killed off Chu Luoxun in the novel. This was unlike some authors who would try to shift the blame after messing things up, without intending to apologize to the readers, or even reflect upon themselves.</p><br/><p>Some netizens insisted that Master Leng Zi was a guy, but they were drowned out by voices who sang praises of Master Leng Zi\u2019s beauty.</p><br/><p>Gender did not really matter, as many netizens had resigned to the fact that they might never even have the chance to see Master Leng Zi in person, they only need take in his beauty without doing anything.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why everyone would be alright with a big-cock cutie and even call them the cutest, because they knew that this was only available on the internet, it is no easy task to meet such a cutie in real life\u2026</p><br/><p>Under these circumstances, a few hundred thousand copies of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d was sold out in a short time!</p><br/><p>The piracy issue was severe in this world, especially when it came to cyberpiracy. The pirated version of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d had already flooded the internet like a viral outbreak.</p><br/><p>With the advanced technology of the internet, the sales of real books had taken a dip over time, but this novel enjoyed decent sales, thanks to many \u201caestheticians\u201d and those who supported Master Leng Zi!</p><br/><p>The editors of the magazine company were confused, was this Han Leng really a beautiful female author? The data shows that he was indeed a male\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Leng saw his female outfit photos going viral on the internet; he felt excited and uneasy at the same time. Most of them were praising him for being beautiful, which blew more hot air into his head. He felt that he was the most beautiful person in this world\u2026</p><br/><p>After killing off Chu Luoxun, he has finally found another true love! Naturally, everyone would see as clear as day that he was lying to himself. He knew that he felt a familiar feeling as Zhao Youyue plays the violin, but he was too afraid to admit it. He would only admit it after she takes him to wonderland a few more times.</p><br/><p>Falling in love with himself would not be as pathetic as Chen Haoran\u2019s case, getting rejected by Lady Zhao in the face.</p><br/><p>Translator note:</p><br/><p>[1] Prprpr \u2013 peroperois an internet slang used by the Japanese otakus to describe licking something vigorously.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was commonly known that relationships took time to maintain.</p><br/><p>A couple falling in love with each other was just an act of two lonely souls who pretended that they cared about each other. They wasted a lot of time and effort to express their artificial hearts and untrue feelings.</p><br/><p>If only everybody knew about this unspoken truth\u2026</p><br/><p>Anybody who took the time to observe a couple would quickly see through the falsehoods and fractures. When love comes, intelligence fled. Everything would make sense, no matter how irrational it sounded. Of course, if an observer was drawn into this game of love, they would soon learn how sweet these empty words raelly were, and how they had the power to pluck the stars from the sky.</p><br/><p>Nothing was real, as long as both of them were happy.

She would never waste any of her precious time on these pointless interactions. Generally, love ended with the same thing \u2013 procreation. After all, humans were still mammals. They did it like how animals did it on Discovery Channel.</p><br/><p>As technology advances, humans may no longer need contact between males and females. One may even be capable of self-division.</p><br/><p>One might be passive at starting a relationship, but he or she could not avoid having others trying to find them a suitable partner. Being born with high status, Zhao Youyue would often be dragged into some date with a man of similar stature.</p><br/><p>It was yet another PR event. Since both of them were equal in status, it would bring no harm to see if she could be interested in that guy.</p><br/><p>During the day, Zhao Youyue was busy preparing for the presidential elections.

Travelers started pouring into Kaer Morhen from all directions!</p><br/><p>It had been Olivia\u2019s ambition the become an empress, yet now she was a great businesswoman. Even the witchers of The School of Wolf did not need to spill their blood on their weapons during a dangerous hunt. [2] They could simply buy the potions and bombs they needed.</p><br/><p>Such was the power of money. Now Olivia had all the fundings she needed. She began to build her own army, equipping them with firepower.</p><br/><p>Kaer Morhen and Olivia\u2019s chamber of commerce had now made a name as a neutral party. Some interested parties often hired them to handle some dirty situations. None of the missions failed, yet.</p><br/><p>These side missions appeared in her minimap as a question mark. Zhao Youyue did not have to handle it herself \u2013 the system could arrange a solution for it.</p><br/><p>The only thing she wanted to do now was to accompany her beloved sister Cirilla\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue polished her business skills in the source world\u2019s enormous market. In reality, she used the same tactics to manage a few subsidiaries of her company. A new magnificent CEO was building her own reputation!</p><br/><p>It had been quite some time since Lady Zhao was called CEO Zhao\u2026</p><br/><p>However, as Zhao Youyue pierced her way through the path of greatness, her parents dragged her to dinner.</p><br/><p>It was a typical Chinese dinner in a reputable restaurant. The ceiling was decorated with elegant crystal chandeliers, and a roundtable was placed right beneath each of them. When dinner was served, the tables rotated by themselves.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was still the adorable, obedient girl in front of her parents. It was only courteous to do so since they respected and granted Lady Zhao the freedom of choices in life.

The name is a corruption of the Elder Speech name of Caer a\u2019Muirehen, which means \u201cOld Sea Keep\u201d, so named for the presence of fossilized sea creatures embedded in the stones on which it was built. It is located in the mountains of the kingdom of Kaedwen, right off the Gwenllech river.</p><br/><p>In older times, witchers trained and underwent mutations here, but fanatics who considered witchers an abomination attacked the keep and killed most of the teachers and students. Vesemir was the last known witcher to live in the keep, although other witchers sometimes rested here between their assignments, often during the winter, after which they set out on The Path again.</p><br/><p>[2] School of the Wolf (), known in Nilfgaard as the Order of Witchers, is a school of witchers headquartered at Kaer Morhen in Kaedwen.</p></div>\n</div>"}

The little angel, Jiang Qing had spent the whole year studying because she really wanted to be in the same class as Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>The little angel, Jiang Qing was finally reunited with Zhao Youyue. Of course, Zhao Youyue was delighted, but she did not dare to corrupt her once again. Jiang Qing had learned her lesson as well. She would still hang out with Lady Zhao, but she had to control herself, or else she would end up having terrible results in the final exam.</p><br/><p>Even though Jiang Qing was fortunate enough to enter the elite class, her grades were considered below average in this class. If it was not for Zhao Youyue, she would not have entered this class by choice. She could easily be a top student in an average class and be proud about it, but ending up as a nobody among this classroom of elites only served to pile up the stress on her.</p><br/><p>Still, being classmates with Zhao Youyue once again was fun! She could chat with her during her free time and share snacks. This was Jiang Qing\u2019s ideal student life!</p><br/><p>All of the efforts that she meted out in the previous year had not been in vain\u2026</p><br/><p>Having learned her lesson, she should be able to maintain a balanced life. Honestly, she was partly to blame for having too much fun with Zhao Youyue. If she had spoken out, Zhao Youyue might not have been so playful. Unfortunately, Jiang Qing did not have the same talents as Zhao Youyue, or else she would not have to bother about her academic results.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing was relieved to learn that she would not Zhao Youyue\u2019s deskmate once again. That trickster would never run out of new methods of corrupting her\u2026</p><br/><p>No ordinary person could sit beside Zhao Youyue and remain the same.</p><br/><p>Seated beside such a fierce competitor, Bai Yunshan acquired the title of \u201cSecond child\u201d with pride. Previously, she did not have stable academic results, but ever since she became the deskmate of Zhao Youyue, she picked her pace up, as if she was telling everyone that she was the closest person to emulating Lady Zhao\u2019s achievements.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan and Zhao Youyue grew closer after the sports event. She had even been to Zhao Youyue\u2019s house and tasted her homecooked meal.</p><br/><p>Of course, Bai Yunshan bought the ingredients, because she wanted to treat Zhao Youyue for a meal.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan was grateful for Zhao Youyue\u2019s initiative the sports meeting, bringing honor to their class. Bai Yunshan was on her period on that day, and Zhao Youyue had helped her out of a pinch. For that, Bai Yunshan wanted to treat Zhao Youyue to a meal as a show of her gratitude.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan had changed her opinion about Zhao Youyue ever since she brought honor to their class; she thought Zhao Youyue was not actually a bad person, only pretending to be one\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue accepted her gratitude, but she suggested to cook for her because she knew Bai Yunshan was a thrifty and simple person. If they went to a restaurant and Bai Yunshan got to witness how Zhao Youyue treated the food, they might end up in a fistfight.</p><br/><p>Whenever Zhao Youyue ate outside, she never ate to satisfy her hunger; she only wanted to taste the gourmet. Su Li understood this the most, and her assistants were lucky to have leftovers, because Su Li would never let such food go to waste.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Yunshan was a simple and thrifty person, she did not have the slightest hint on the culinary arts. After all, she was also a rich man\u2019s daughter. As she went out on her shopping trip, sumptuous was one of the ideas she had in mind, but at the same time, she did not want to cause too much trouble to Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue also told her that even though she knew how to cook, but her skills were only limited to home dishes. It would be a tough job to ask of Zhao Youyue to prepare an exquisite cuisine.</p><br/><p>In the end, Bai Yunshan bought the ingredients for three dishes and a soup. She experienced the fortune of tasting the homecooked meal made by Zhao Youyue, and it was delicious\u2026 Not a speck remained on her plate; Zhao Youyue nearly thought that she had created some form of \u201cshiny cuisine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This meal worked to the betterment of their relationship. Bai Yunshan was the typical cool queen. She had no close friends to call her own, and wandered in the cosmos like a lone comet. Somehow, she looked more like the main protagonist than Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Even though Bai Yunshan acknowledged Zhao Youyue, she did not know how to express it. She was just that awkward. She would stand up like a justicar whenever she witnessed an act of injustice.</p><br/><p>She had zero social skills and did not understand human behavior, so what made her the class rep? She had gained the favor of the teachers, she had great academic results with a great sense of honor to boot, and she would report any incidents to the teachers. Most importantly, of course, was her family background.</p><br/><p>The socially inept Bai Yunshan basked in all this solidarity like a champion. Nothing could faze her, for she was a fighter. However, she maintained the noble practice of persuading people with her words, not her might.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue always thought that Bai Yunshan was a cute girl, and such a pure person was a rare sight. Bai Yunshan was a dense girl, so Zhao Youyue had to take the initiative.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao was the typically shameless, heartless person. She might be the only one to have successfully bribed Bai Yunshan. Ever since that meal, Bai Yunshan would turn a blind eye to a select variety of Zhao Youyue\u2019s actions. Bai Yunshan knew it would be futile even to try reporting it to the teachers. Her academic results were simply too excellent; and teachers viewed her as the model student\u2026</p><br/><p>On the first day of third-year in high school, Zhao Youyue had given Bai Yunshan a passionate hug when she first saw her; even pressing her face against hers!</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan had been dumbfounded. If others tried this on her, she would have already punched the daylights out of them!</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see, Shan Shan! Did you miss your little cutie, Zhao Youyue?\u201d Zhao Youyue said it in an extremely leisurely manner, acting like she was a little bug in front of the other lady.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan took a whiff of delicate fragrance from Zhao Youyue. She did not hate the initiative and intimate Zhao Youyue, rather, she felt the warmth. She knew that Zhao Youyue had an incredibly powerful family; she also knew Zhao Youyue would not have to treat her this nicely to gain something from her. Zhao Youyue was treating her nicely because she wanted to.</p><br/><p>After all this time, Zhao Youyue was probably the only one who treated her the best, and she still did not know why.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Youyue, you asked me to grow my hair out, so why did you cut yours!\u201d Bai Yunshan was the first person to discover the most beautiful person in school, but she felt as if she had been cheated of something\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan would only call Zhao Youyue by her name; she would never call her \u201clittle cutie,\u201d not even in death! It was too disgusting! Here, Zhao Youyue was shamelessly calling herself a little cutie. What would she do in front of the others?</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue would never do that in front of others, and that was because the tri-no Bai Yunshan was simply too dense and fun to tease. At that moment, she looked at the gullible Bai Yunshan, and a ridiculous idea struck her mind; which she immediately voiced\u2026</p><br/><p>We can take turns becoming the campus belle!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

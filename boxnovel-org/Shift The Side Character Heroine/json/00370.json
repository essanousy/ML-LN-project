He had born from a rich, real estate agent family anyway. He may not be the richest out there, but he could have most certainly lived an easy life. He also had the royalties from those two books which were selling well. How had he fallen so drastically?</p><br/><p>Through further understanding, only did Zhao Youyue figure out that something had gone wrong in his family. On the surface, it all seemed like an accident, as the official who had accepted a bribe to cover the illegal businesses had been exposed and dismissed. As a real estate agent, Shi Jingnian\u2019s father was undoubtedly involved with crimes such as bribery, gangdom, etc. Real estate businesses were not so clean in this era.</p><br/><p>This was no accident. It had something to do with Lady Lu Xue. Of course, Lu Xue was unaware of her apparent involvement. It was her father, who had been most disapproving of Shi Jingnian approaching her.</p><br/><p>There was once a period when Lu Xue had been infatuated over Shi Jingnian. Even while knowing that he already had a girlfriend, she never faltered. Her love had even given robbed her of reason, and she ran from home. Although all this was in the past, her father deeply hated Shi Jingnian.</p><br/><p>A coal proprietor may seem to be of a lowly caste, but in actuality, they were filthy rich. With money, he could do anything he wanted.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian\u2019s father was not some great real estate agent. His influence was limited to only a county-level city. In the eyes of great people, he would be referred to as a contractor, instead of a real estate agent.</p><br/><p>Lu Xue\u2019s father was an actual, great coal proprietor. He was famous within the province. And so, it led to a series of unfortunate events befalling upon Shi Jingnian, one after another.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Lu Xue\u2019s father did not cause too much trouble. He only caused Shi Jingnian\u2019s family to go bankrupt. His father went into prison, but would not receive severe punishment. Moreover, by satisfying those officers\u2019 with money, his father could get out of prison.</p><br/><p>Many officers made different decisions, according to different situations. For situations like Shi Jingnian\u2019s family, they only wanted to drain every single penny from them. It would be very exciting if they were able to have fun with a rich agent\u2019s wife\u2026</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian had earned a few hundred thousands through his incomplete novels. He hoped that he would be able to put this money to use, and get his father out of prison.</p><br/><p>His own days were numbered, he was a broken man. His odds of survival outside the hospital were slim.</p><br/><p>Even so, he still had the confidence to complete \u201cBakuman.\u201d Even if his readers were unable to witness the masterpieces within, he would be very satisfied to show it to Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue had gotten a clearer image of Shi Jingnian\u2019s experience over the last six months, she remained silent for a long time. Was Su Li\u2019s drawing pen truly capable of damning others to hell?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Shi Jingnian\u2019s situation a little ridiculous?</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Youyue\u2019s first impression towards him, or the only impression, was not very nice, anyway, Zhao Youyue was still very satisfied to have him as the author of \u201cBakuman.\u201d As long as Shi Jingnian continued writing, she would definitely obtain her fourth iconic character card.</p><br/><p>Regardless of Shi Jingnian\u2019s peculiar character and eccentricity, his talents were undeniably remarkable!</p><br/><p>That was enough for Zhao Youyue. Moreover, he had never taken the initiative to pursue Zhao Youyue. Therefore, Zhao Youyue\u2019s impression towards him had changed.</p><br/><p>Now that she had understood Shi Jingnian\u2019s current situation, sympathy rose from within Zhao Youyue. Of course, it was more of \u2018what a waste of a good asset,\u2019 than how she felt as a person.</p><br/><p>Thus, Zhao Youyue decided to seek her father\u2019s help, to at least allowed Shi Jingnian to recuperate and continue writing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi loved his daughter very much. His private hospital was not affiliated to the government, but it boasted the best medical facilities in the entire world. The only problem was that this hospital was opened only to aristocrats. Regular people were not qualified to even set foot in this hospital.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi agreed to take Shi Jingnian in only after he had made a thorough investigation on him. Frankly speaking, if Shi Jingnian still retained his original \u201cfemale-slayer\u2019s\u201d appearance, Zhao Jiayi might not have agreed so readily.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, his daughter had reached the age to start a love relationship. As for the partner, appearance and talents aside, had to at least be faithful. His daughter was a gem, so why couldn\u2019t she find a good, faithful man?</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian\u2019s entire history from birth had been laid out in front of Zhao Jiayi. Great families usually did better at collecting information.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi disliked Shi Jingnian\u2019s handsome face. That pair of deep, mesmerizing eyes were shaped like peach blossoms. Men who were too handsome did not give him much reassurance!</p><br/><p>After he looked at Shi Jingnian\u2019s confusing relationship with females, Zhao Jiayi could not resist wanting to scold those life winners.</p><br/><p>Yet, Shi Jingnian\u2019s misfortunes later drew a helpless sight from Zhao Jiayi. Besides, Shi Jingnian\u2019s recent appearance had become unrecognizable, and he probably would have to sit on a wheelchair for the rest of his life\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi instantly felt relieved. His daughter was far too kind. They were supposed to have only met once. Just because she was his reader, she had been willing to lend him a helping hand. Such morality alone was definitely higher than those \u201csoulmates\u201d who had left Shi Jingnian one after another, after the accident!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was indeed an excellent Chinese reader!</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian\u2019s mother was already at the end of her rope. But when she heard that a saint was lending her son a helping hand, she could not help but shed tears of gratitude. This was truly her son\u2019s savior!</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian did not feel any happier about it, but it was always better to be able to live longer. He only regretted not taking a more active role in solving his family\u2019s debt problem. He did not need to write for money in the past, but now he had to do so.</p><br/><p>He was not against such a course of action. He just might be able to get over this defect of his.</p><br/><p>Those web novel readers who could not wait to curse Shi Jingnian to death were finally blessed.</p><br/><p>It was in the garden of Zhao Youyue\u2019s family hospital when Shi Jingnian met Zhao Youyue once again. Shi Jingnian had always been able to see through things. The moment he saw the worker beside Zhao Youyue being respectful and polite to her, he almost instantly understood the reason he had suddenly earned the qualifications to recuperate in this vast and luxurious hospital for free</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian only knew that Zhao Youyue was a Lady, without knowing what level she actually stood on. Now, did he understand.</p><br/><p>Her level was way higher than Lady Lu Xue\u2019s.</p><br/><p>At the moment, Shi Jingnian could not restrain his feelings. When all the girls beside had abandoned him, Zhao Youyue, the Lady who had always been vocal about her frustrations towards him, had actually lent him a helping hand. She did not even bat an eyelid at his broken state.</p><br/><p>Now, he had lost his beauty, his money, and his body. Even so, Lady Zhao treated him just the same</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve actually burned up a lifetime\u2019s worth of luck in order to meet you.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

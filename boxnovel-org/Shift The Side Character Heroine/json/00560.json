The atmosphere of the entire dormitory turned harmonious not long after.</p><br/><p>Starting an external war was a very useful tactic to quell internal strife. He Weiwei and Yu Xuefei were supposed to be enemies. Fortunately, Yu Xuefei was the type to fight with her tongue and nothing else, or they would have already come to blows. They took verbal warfare to another level.</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei had also declared in the group chat that she wanted to inspect the smelly dormitory next door, under her power as a discipline committee member of the Student Council. When Zhao Youyue learned that Yu Xuefei had joined the Student Council, she smiled within her heart. \u201cNot bad. I\u2019ve not yet joined and claimed the Student Council as my own, but my comrades are already pouring in to herald my arrival!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Weiwei, have you not joined any clubs yet?\u201d Zhao Youyue typed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. Many have invited me, but they are all full of male students. Those clubs are like dens of wolves. So, which club do you intend to join, My Lady?\u201d replied He Weiwei.</p><br/><p>He Weiwei had started to call Zhao Youyue \u201cMy Lady\u201d now. She had always considered such a title to be ridiculously fanciful, but she used it on Zhao Youyue in a half respectful, half ridicule tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to build my own club, why don\u2019t you join mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Building one yourself? Is there such an option? I\u2019m just doing this for my academic points. What type of club is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 How about having afternoon tea after school? Or maybe a Snacks Department?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He Weiwei was shocked. Was such a club even allowed? Would the Student Council approve of such a club, much less fund it?</p><br/><p>Such a club sounded ridiculous, but Lady Zhao\u2019s endless low-key luxurious lifestyle during peacetime had always amazed her. She had to admit. The idea of receiving funds and academic credits by leisurely eating and drinking was amazing\u2026 It would be a reckless waste of God\u2019s gift to pass by such an opportunity!</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei started regretting her rash decision of joining the Student Council. I could have followed this Lady into a life of bliss and indulgement\u2026</p><br/><p>No, she had to remain strong. The Student Council was the most glorious route, the most respectful organization, and the one that would lead her far in life!</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei felt that she could become the reliable Student Council backup of this Lady roommate. She would be her hidden backup, her source of power. Moreover, she would enjoy a taste of an official\u2019s life. For starters, she would definitely be utilizing what little authority she had to cause trouble to the dormitory next door.</p><br/><p>The idea of this rich Lady claiming the Student Council one day did not even occur to her. Why struggle in her small-scale battle, when the rich beautiful Lady would become the President herself?</p><br/><p>In the end, He Weiwei had joined Lady Zhao in a daze. And so, Zhao Youyue\u2019s weird club now had three members. She was two members short from officially submitting the application.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the training was finally nearing its end. Rumors related to Zhao Youyue had reached its peak. Her Lady identity was also revealed. This only raised more questions\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Do you really think that she\u2019s a Lady, just because she\u2019s rich? Have you ever sat down to think where her money came from? Isn\u2019t it obvious?</p><br/><p>Then, the focus of the rumors transferred to other aspects. Someone expressed, \u201cEven if Zhao Youyue is a Lady, she must be the most incompetent Lady. May I ask, what other talent does she have other than her beauty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if she\u2019s beautiful, so what if she has a rich family? It only proves that she\u2019s lucky and has mastered the art of reincarnation. But what does she have to offer for herself?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no stopping the rumors now.</p><br/><p>Was this a coincidence? Was this planned? The training would be concluded with a literature and art evening party. Fate had seemed to have handed over a stage to Zhao Youyue to shine once again\u2026</p><br/><p>Right before the evening party, Zhao Youyue had the opportunity to glimmer a little.</p><br/><p>Two companies initiated a sing-off \u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys, yeah. I\u2019m talking to you guys. Send someone out already! Don\u2019t keep us waiting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou first! Where\u2019s your man? Don\u2019t have any? Hah!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne two three, faster faster faster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne two three four five, don\u2019t let us wait and suffer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne two three four five six seven, we can wait no longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne two three four five six seven eight nine, do you guys actually have a presenter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wind\u2019s blowing, the drum\u2019s beating, are you petrified by the terror?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Such singing could not usually be called singing, per se. The winner was not the company that sang better \u2013 it was the company that sang louder. And so, the companies began to sing all sorts of iconic military songs such as \u201cUnity is Strength,\u201d \u201cBack from Target Practice,\u201d \u201cGreen Flower in the Army.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the beginning, the singing challenge surely lived to its name. Participants even kept track of the rhythm and beat. It was a rather serious affair, albeit being a little monotonous.</p><br/><p>Now that the training was coming to an end, they have finally started to unwind. When two companies met, it was no longer a group effort. The two companies would send single representatives for \u201csong fights,\u201d and \u201cdance fights.\u201d Everyone enjoyed the process very much.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s company was up against another company. Both companies then sat opposite each other on the field. They had bunched together, leaving just enough space in the middle for two.</p><br/><p>The opposing company hailed from the Department of Economic Management. It paved the route to a somewhat popular profession in Jiangnan Province. It was practical, robust, and secure. It was relatively professional and practical, compared to the Chinese Studies course. Bai Yunshan had selected this profession.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue caught her best friend\u2019s eye, and they started winking and waving enthusiastically at each other. Then, she sat back, enjoying the battle of talents happening in the middle. Most of them sang a song. Others threw out some street dance moves.</p><br/><p>Regardless of the skill level, performing in front of hundreds of people was already an admirable feat.</p><br/><p>Some of them were actually forcefully \u201cencouraged\u201d by students to perform. Stepping into the ring was worthy of respect, for several others would refuse to budge, no matter how much they were \u201cencouraged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Xuefei was an example. She had made friends with many classmates. She was still very desperate for the class rep position. Thus, she was \u201cencouraged\u201d to go up the stage and showcase her talent, earning some glory for the company.</p><br/><p>Living up to her character, Yu Xuefei would rather die than go up the stage. She unleashed her \u201cI don\u2019t show, I only blabber\u201d excuses in its entirety, leaving those \u201cencouragers\u201d very disappointed.</p><br/><p>The competition was meant to be carried out in a lighter tone. The situation quickly turned the moment a male student stepped out and sang rather well. After his perfect performance, he got carried away. Half jokingly, half seriously, he had raised his nose and stated that no one from the Chinese Studies course would be able to defeat him in song. All the Chinese Studies students were tone deaf! The Economic Management course has won!</p><br/><p>This had sent the Economic Management course into a wave of laughter. The effect was tremendous. The Chinese Studies fell silent. Instructor Ma was furious. Weren\u2019t the students of Chinese Studies supposed to be young artists? Why was there not even a single person who could sing?</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting, instructor! Zhao Youyue is an excellent singer. She would totally trounce that guy!\u201d Han Leng, the \u201cpatient\u201d of his company, came out of nowhere and shouted. He had had enough!</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao only continued to wink and laugh at Lady Bai. Han Leng\u2019s blood pressure went off the charts. That male student was simply too presumptuous. He had even started singing the song, \u201cHappened to Meet You.\u201d What blasphemy!</p><br/><p>The cover singer was trying to show off to the original singer!</p><br/><p>This was unbearable, it was absolutely intolerable!</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao, please get up the stage and bring the hammer of justice down!</p></div>\n</div>"}

The power of all the characters combined in her as an Empress also took their leave.</p><br/><p>Aside from the abilities of those character cards, Olivia possessed the aura of a ruler, along with extraordinary leadership.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had not determined any of these traits via settings, through her efforts within the source world\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue took a look at the mysterious \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d A new character card had been produced \u2014\u2014 Olivia, the supreme empress. She looked just like her \u201cGwent\u201d card in the source world. She was clad in the most gorgeous royal robes, while languishing on the throne, one hand supporting her chin. The quote was there \u2014\u2014 \u201cI came, I saw, I conquered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Zhao Youyue herself was shocked by such a discovery. She never expected to actually obtain a character card from the source world. What did this mean? A souvenir? After all, she did not need the character card to inherit Olivia\u2019s leadership capabilities. She was Olivia, and Olivia was her.</p><br/><p>Still, she gave the card a try, and only then did she learn of how amazing it actually was!</p><br/><p>Upon switching it on, she did not feel any outburst of supernatural powers. It was as if a certain aura suddenly manifested itself and blanketed her. This aura was the legendary \u201cRuler\u2019s Domineering Aura.\u201d People would be obligated to bowing before her on sight!</p><br/><p>Instead of referring to it as the Empress card, it was better to refer it as the \u201cLong Aotian\u201d card. Clearly, such an aura was only effective on those who lacked the strength of character to resist. But how many of these strong characters would actually exist in this world?</p><br/><p>For the succeeding Student President, such a character card was ideal!</p><br/><p>How could Zhao Youyue ever lose in the elections for the Student President position?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not talk about this election. If she started off a company and became its president, this card would knock the masses down to their knees!</p><br/><p>As the female emperor who was able to unite the entire continent, Olivia was the protagonist among protagonists. It would completely bury Zhao Youyue\u2019s \u201cpasserby\u201d attribute and turn her into a genuine protagonist!</p><br/><p>What an amazingly powerful card!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue finally learned of its true value. A character card could also be crafted by living its life within the source world. When the source world, or at the very least, its occupants recognize her, a character card would be produced. From a passerby princess to the ruler of the entire continent. This character card was easily on par with an iconic character card!</p><br/><p>No, it could even be called a \u201clegendary character card.\u201d It was far rarer than a mere icon!</p><br/><p>After all, iconic character cards merely endowed Zhao Youyue with some form of ability. A legendary card like this laid down the whole protagonist\u2019s buff package onto Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>The source worlds were often inspirations for iconic works. If Zhao Youyue played the role of a certain character and stirred things up within that particular source world, it was equivalent to her playing the role of a character within an iconic work.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, the more she stirred up in the source world, the more profound the impact, and the higher the chances of this character becoming iconic!</p><br/><p>She was already within an iconic work. She went on to be the icon of that iconic world. If her character was still not a legendary character, who was?</p><br/><p>Every single person within the source world of \u201cThe Witcher\u201d knew of her name!</p><br/><p>It was no surprise to find her in the books of history as a legend, complete with her own legendary character card in Gwent.</p><br/><p>Olivia\u2019s experiences within that source world were nothing short of legendary. Nobody who has looked back at her life could not deny it.</p><br/><p>She had started off as the Princess of a small kingdom. However, her father was the great Emperor Emhyr. Eventually, her small kingdom fell. The tragedy did not get to her. Instead, she rose above the ashes. First, she became the leader of Kaer Morhen while establishing the number one chamber of commerce on the continent. Then, she invested heavily in magic and technology research. Eventually, she formed a modernized army and then wiped out the entire continent!</p><br/><p>Even her maternal grandmother thoroughly underestimated her. She soon learned of how wrong she was. When she finally stood before her biological father as the superior ruler \u2014 the vision of the Empress Reagent towering over the great Nilfgaardian Empire was immortalized on canvas.</p><br/><p>Now that Olivia was the female emperor, she was in the position to deal with the threat from another world. This \u201cWild Hunt\u201d was playing with death!</p><br/><p>Perhaps the Wild Hunt only existed to trigger the appearance of the \u201cMonsters Gwent Deck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Either way, Olivia was now a demigod of the source world. She now had the entire glove within her palms!</p><br/><p>She fully deserved her legendary status!</p><br/><p>In reality, someone out there would be drawing inspiration from this world and create \u201cThe Witcher\u201d trilogy. Olivia would also enter the scene as a character within the game\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, Zhao Youyue could relive Olivia\u2019s legend of uniting the entire continent on her computer. It would be an amazing CGI that told the story of a western fantasy \u2014 \u201cRoad to a Female Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>It swelled up on the internet, clogging servers and streaming hosts. Some viewers had predicted this series to one day blow up. Undoubtedly, its quality was impeccable. Not a single flaw could be detected. More unbelievable was the VAs\u2019 performance. They were no longer playing the part of any character \u2014 they were the characters!</p><br/><p>Now that Zhao Youyue had obtained this ridiculously legendary card, she did not celebrate. On the contrary, there was a tinge of regret in her heart. Why had she been so passive in the previous supernatural genre source world? If she had tried her best to stir things up and conquer the source world, she might have already obtained an even rarer \u201clegendary character card\u201d from the start!</p><br/><p>She very much still needed the assistance of the \u201csystem.\u201d With the system, one could still enjoy completing quests. Quests would eventually lead a person to the peak of their existence!</p><br/><p>Of all the characters that Zhao Youyue had ever possessed, Olivia was probably the most aggressive, power-hungry careerist ever.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Even with the help of \u201cXu Jing\u2019s card,\u201d she was not even close to surpassing him in terms studying. It was apparent that his standards and hers were not on the same level, and it was not because she was not hardworking enough.</p><br/><p>When Wang Zongchao asked Zhao Youyue how she managed to get good results for English, she could not simply say that she relied on her \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card,\u201d so she decided to go along with the premise that she played lots of foreign language games. She preferred to play them in their original languages, so she had no other choice but to master the English language\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the actual reason why Yu Shengfan was good with languages from several countries. But in reality, it sounds cooler when Zhao Youyue says it out herself.</p><br/><p>Of course, when Wang Zongchao was asking her this in the chat group, the other top students were hanging on to every word she said, hoping to take a leave out of her book, but then she had blurted out that it was because she liked to play foreign games\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, not just English, but you\u2019re good at other languages as well?\u201d asked Wang Zongchao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could say that, and I would spend two hours gaming a day because I really enjoy them,\u201d Zhao Youyue answered honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo hours? How do you have so much leisure time?\u201d Wang Zongchao was incredulous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have some spare time during the night\u2026 I only need to finish my homework earlier.\u201d Zhao Youyue replied without giving it too much thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you suppose to self-study at night?\u201d Wang Zongchao was amazed. Each question only gives rise to more questions! This isn\u2019t a simple girl!</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026 I\u2019m actually a commuting student, so I don\u2019t have to attend night self-study classes. After I\u2019m done with homework, I could play to my heart\u2019s content\u201d Zhao Youyue retained her cool and answered him casually.</p><br/><p>After she replied, the group remained silent for a while. Shortly after, everyone was sending pictures of worshiping her like some sort of God\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone had thought that Zhao Youyue was the hardworking type of elite scholar, especially based on her performance in Mathematics. If elite scholars never work hard enough, their results would inevitably deteriorate. An elite scholar such as Wang Zongchao was without a doubt a natural genius and made sure to pair it up with superhuman effort. Only with that, he has been able to secure his ranking in this school.</p><br/><p>As it turns out, Zhao Youyue was not a hardworking elite scholar!</p><br/><p>She was indeed a genius; she could spend two hours a day playing games and still maintain such results! Even Wang Zongchao would not manage that!</p><br/><p>Guo Peisheng could not help himself but speak up, \u201cWow, Zhao Youyue you\u2019re awesome! I envy you could take it easy and still get such amazing results. We had to take competition classes every night, why didn\u2019t you join us? You\u2019re such a genius\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was struck dumb for a moment. No one had ever praised her for being smart, not even her old mama. She was well aware of her navet and candour, but this was actually the first time anyone has ever praised her of being smart!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really good at doing questions in competitions\u2026 They were too difficult for me! Actually, I\u2019m not that smart either; I worked hard for the results I\u2019ve obtained!\u201d Zhao Youyue defended for herself.</p><br/><p>If she was a genius elite scholar, she would not need the help of \u201cXu Jing\u2019s card\u201d, she would still have gotten into the top ten position in school without having to study so diligently. As for the first place, it would not be easy for her, because there was a hardworking genius in her school. That combination would be unbeatable, no matter what.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue said that she was the hardworking type, this rendered the other top students speechless. They were surprised to find that among the top students, there was a student who had the time to play computer games every day and still claim to be hardworking in her studies\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was telling the truth, because she always made sure to pay attention in class, and she would do her homework attentively, while also making sure that she gets the critical points in every day\u2019s class. This was all the effort that Zhao Youyue poured into her studying, which reaped great rewards in return.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of other top students, they were all jealous of Zhao Youyue because she still managed to get into the top ten position while playing games every day, for two hours!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026 Well, let\u2019s officially welcome Zhao Youyue into our study group, since we have a half day off tomorrow, why don\u2019t we have lunch together to celebrate this event? What do you say, brother Chao?\u201d Guo Peisheng suggested, it appeared that Wang Zongchao was the de facto leader of this group.</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao was just a first-year high school student, but he was already the vice president of the student council club. If he manages to maintain his grades, it would not be a problem for him becoming the president of the student council in his second-year. Since all third-year high school students would be focusing on their final exams, it was natural for the president to give up his or her position to the vice president, it was a tradition in this school.</p><br/><p>Of course, Wang Zongchao himself would not hesitate to take up that role, because he enjoyed the feeling of ruling over other students. His idol was the founder of the country, and his favorite book was \u201cDynasty Biography.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly, I\u2019m glad to have Zhao Youyue in our group, she has earned her rights to join us, are you free to join us for lunch tomorrow, Zhao Youyue?\u201d Wang Zongchao asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was aware of her surroundings, so she definitely would not turn down such an invitation. She was well-informed of who was in charge of this top students group. Obviously, it was Wang Zongchao, and Guo Peisheng, both of them were also the student council members.</p><br/><p>Honestly, these top students gaze Zhao Youyue the creeps, they spoke as if they stood on a pedestal, gazing down at the masses over the tips of their noses. Zhao Youyue was once a \u201cnormal\u201d person in their eyes.</p><br/><p>They even liked to brag about the privileges they had given by their homeroom teacher, and all of these privileges were greater than Zhao Youyue\u2019s. As long as they could maintain the first place in class, or the top twenty in the whole grade, they could do anything they wanted. Unfortunately, to maintain their grades, they had to sacrifice many other things such as hobbies.</p><br/><p>Now, Zhao Youyue had become the top third person in this group. She had once surpassed Wang Zongchao, and she could secure her rank among the top ten in this test, and she was the only person who had a perfect score in English test in her whole school! It was not easy to attain a perfect score in English, what a freak she was!</p><br/><p>She had scored perfectly because of her composition; her writing was perfect, her grammar was perfect, even her vocabulary was perfect! It would make no sense if the marker does not give her a perfect score! The English reading comprehension was a multiple choice question, unlike the Chinese test which required a little bit of luck, and as long as her composition has a perfect score, she would definitely get full marks for her English test!</p><br/><p>Obviously, Zhao Youyue had surpassed Wang Zongchao regarding languages, which was the reason why she had gained acknowledgment from these top students.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m free tomorrow\u2026 But pardon me for asking, I believe that my classmate, Chen Haoran did better than me in this test, why isn\u2019t he in this group?\u201d Zhao Youyue probed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is only strong in science subjects, and if it wasn\u2019t for the science subjects being so tough for this test, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to even squeeze into the top ten. Even though he is good in science, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to surpass brother Chao, this group doesn\u2019t need him as long as we have brother Chao.\u201d Guo Peisheng said arrogantly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue suddenly realized that no one in her class had ever earned the rights to joining this top students\u2019 study group\u2026</p>\n</div>"}

He started to watch the live broadcast. Through the popups, he realized that she was a tycoon herself. She was actually live-streaming herself, spamming tens of thousands of dollars just to get an SSR rank card in a card game.</p><br/><p>Although she eventually got it, everyone still generally considered it as a loss, the live streamer\u2019s luck was not particularly good, afterall.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Youyue started to live stream herself playing \u201cKing of Glory.\u201d She did not use her own QQ ID to play, as she was still concerned about her privacy. As a result, more popups came up, laughing at her, saying that, \u201cIsn\u2019t this live streamer quite rich? Why aren\u2019t all the heroes and relics in her KoG account fully unlocked?\u2026</p><br/><p>If it was \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 who got the butt end of those taunts at this moment, she would immediately fall into the bait and spam money unlocking all the heroes and relics. Zhao Youyue only smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s too much. We need to give the other players a chance. When I play this, it\u2019s okay for me to choose any hero at random, without full relics. That\u2019s the only way we can enjoy a balanced gameplay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she inadvertently showed her level 3 \u2018Xinyue member'[1] symbol, which was followed by a wave of \u2018666\u2019s[2] among the popups. Anyone who understands the Xinyue member system would instantly get what that level 3 meant. Being a level 3 Xinyue member meant that Zhao Youyue has spent at least 80k RMB on Tencent games. That is how you achieve the highest level of Xinyue membership!</p><br/><p>The more you play Tencent games, the better you would know that Xinyue members with the highest level have privileges. No matter what problems they encounter with their account, attending to them would become first priority. This is Tencent Gaming, creating games with all their \u2018hearts\u2019. You can hardly play their games without spending any money.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s calm way of lowkey bragging was far more provocative, compared to Xiao Yu\u2019s straightforward railing. In response to that low-key taunt, some viewers started spamming a lot of vulgar phrases, eventually getting themselves banned.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao suddenly laughed when he saw this scene. He spoke within his heart, \u201cThis tycoon female live streamer is certainly quite interesting. Just like what everyone says, lowkey taunts are the most critical ones. She seems to have maxed out her \u2018invisible showoff\u2019 skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one thing that confused Zhao Hao. Up till this moment, he still could not find any similarities between this female live streamer and \u2018Yu Shengfan.\u2019 Such a calm attitude was apparently more like the main protagonist of \u201cThe Strongest King,\u201d Lin Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>However, this matter did not hinder Zhao Hao from watching happily. This female live streamer called \u2018Ah Yu\u2019, is indeed considered one of a kind amongst all female live streamers. She retained her calm at all times, as if nothing could move her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue chose to play Zhuge Liang the \u2018Star Commander,\u2019 a hero that she had acquired, along with a hero-experiencing card and skin-experiencing card. This was a hero who had a lot to show. His positional shifting skills were similar to the hero \u2018EZ'[3] of \u201cLeague of Legends.\u201d He is able to continuously shift his position here and there, displaying the limits of the game.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue then played and narrated calmly at the same time as usual. Oftentimes, before she could even finish her sentences, an enemy would have already died\u2026</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the \u2018Zhuge Liang\u2019 under her control killed its target with a blistering combo. She eventually achieved \u2018beyond godlike\u2019 status at the 10th minute and ended the game in just 15 minutes. It felt really like she was bullying primary students.</p><br/><p>This is definitely Zhao Youyue\u2019s personal capability. She had not relied on Yu Shengfan.</p><br/><p>KoG was too easy for her now.</p><br/><p>After she was finished playing KoG, she played one round of solo ranking match in LoL. In order to save time, she opted for the empty position, which was naturally the \u2018support\u2019 position. She picked Veigar, the evil little mage as support. As a result, a \u20181 for 2\u2019 trade happened at the bottom lane, where she killed two enemy heroes. Her ally ADC [4]felt angry, saying that she was stealing his kills and was not behaving like any supporter whatsoever. He then scolded her on the \u2018To all\u2019 channel.</p><br/><p>Luckily, it was Zhao Youyue who was playing now, not Xiao Yu. If not, according to Xiao Yu\u2019s style, this ADC might have been flamed until he starts doubting his own life, by now. Xiao Yu had never taken the initiative at flaming her teammates, but this did not mean that she would stay silent when her teammates flame at her.</p><br/><p>Some popups started to respond on behalf of Zhao Youyue\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis ADC must be a m*ron. According to that situation, there\u2019s no reason to give him the kills. If not, it might have ended up as a \u20182 for 2\u2019 trade\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving such an ADC in a Platinum Rank[5] match is stupid, to say the least. Host, do hurry and advance to Diamond Rank, so that you avoid meeting such players again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo \u2018admirable\u2019! A snot-faced noob, yet already throwing a tantrum, that is truly bullsh*t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe host should not have opted to fill the empty spot. How peaceful would it be to be able to solo-mid! She can definitely carry the game, as long as her teammates aren\u2019t noobs. But if she plays support, then it would be quite a struggle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The ADC actually chose to go farming in the jungle and resorted to ganking. Zhao Youyue allowed her ally ADC to go on with his flaming and responded with her actions. She soloed at bottom lane in a 1-versus-2 situation, utilizing the two enemy heroes\u2019 miscalculation and overconfidence. They tried to forcefully kill her at the enemy tower, only to end up giving her a Double Kill instead. She sold her supportive items and started playing like a solo mid, eventually becoming stronger and stronger!</p><br/><p>Everyone who plays \u2018Veigar\u2019 should know. Once it gains a significant advantage in the early game, with a high creep-kill count, it would steamroll its way through the rest of the game!</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, seeing Zhao Youyue who had turned a support hero into a carry hero, performing even better than the solo midlaner, her teammates started shouting \u2018666\u2019 at her, in a frenzy. As for the raging, flaming ADC who had been running his mouth of since the beginning, he had long fallen silent. He seemed more like a supporter now, allowing Zhao Youyue to have the bottom lane. He had actually thought that she will be owned in a 1-versus-2 situation. Then, he would be able enjoy laughing at her. However, the enemy heroes kept giving her double kills, one after another instead, until they almost left the game\u2026</p><br/><p>After about 25 minutes, the enemy base was destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201c666, host, you\u2019re too awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Ah Yu keeps playing LoL and increasing her ranking points, she may be able to reach the top rank in no time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease have one more match, you really need to do more than one match per day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly admire Xiao Yu. She played a support as a solo mid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, have another round. Don\u2019t play support, just go solo mid rightaway. Own the enemy, carry the game\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All the commentators within the live broadcast room were so excited, after watching such a dramatic match. This made great streaming. A live streamer using a support to carry the whole game was indeed awe-inspiring.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue also imitated the other live streamers and spoke into her mic, \u201cIf everyone enjoyed watching, please press the \u2018subscribe\u2019 button. Anyone who has free fish balls[6] or likes, do contribute.\u201d</p><br/><p>It has been proven that such a way of asking for subscribers and presents was quite effective. Her total subscriptions had almost reached 50,000</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao expressed enjoyment in watching by clicking the subscription button. Then he sent a popup, \u201cHost, please turn on your webcam. I will immediately give you ten helicopters if you open it!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the commenters saw Boss Hao\u2019s popup and started supporting his idea, asking for the host to open her webcam. They even said, \u201cTen helicopters is worth 5,000 RMB. If that amount is divided by half, the host would already get 2,500 RMB.All she has to do is to open the webcam. What an easy way to earn money\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue nonchalantly dismissed the comment. Zhao Hao was just another stranger to her. She said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m going to end the broadcast. Lastly, I will play my violin for everyone. I will also take song requests.\u201d</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1.Xinyue member Xinyue member is a type of privilege which specializes for Tencent game top up platform and priority experience, mainly for gaming purposes.

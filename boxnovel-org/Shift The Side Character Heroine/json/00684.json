This place was particularly close to heart.</p><br/><p>They had learned of a father\u2019s love there, and freedom that no one else could ever imagine, such as Lily-love. Perhaps only the incestuous King Foltest would consider such a matter \u201csomething natural and beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Truth be told, ordinary people would never understand the depths of the love between Olivia and Cirilla. Instead, it seemed perfectly natural for these sisters to be sticking so close to each other. Wasn\u2019t it quite common for girls to hold hands together, kissing and sleeping together, sharing some skinship?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, if the two of them were males, more than just eyebrows would be raised.</p><br/><p>When Olivia stepped into the city that she had built with her own hands, all eyes turned to her. She was the spiritual leader of Kaer Morhen. Many people had settled down comfortably in her utopia. They believed in this \u201cNorthland Pearl.\u201d As for the early settlers, they laid back and took in the dividends with pleasure.</p><br/><p>Olivia accepted the love with much joy. She was no longer playing some sort of childish role-playing game. She was playing a large-scale, farming type of civilization game. She had no need to personally complete those pesky side quests. As long as her forces completed those quests on her behalf, all would be fine.</p><br/><p>She gradually learned of the power of capital. Then, she established a mercenary union. Her sideline quests would be announced as their primary objectives. She would then pay the mercenaries adequately. Then, she would claim the quest completion rewards and upgrade her techniques. At the same time, she practiced her magic and invented more highly-priced goods. She was often able to more than cover the costs for the mercenaries. And so, the lucrative cycle went on.</p><br/><p>Lady Olivia, equipped with her knowledge of the modern financial system, initialized revolution after revolution. As Kaer Morhen grew in strength, she started entertaining thoughts of issuing her own currency. It was her time to exploit the continent to her ends. Of course, she had to first raise a formidable army.</p><br/><p>Olivia had grown wealthy. It was time to train her army. She intended to incorporate modern methods in the process. When one is rich AND power, what\u2019s there to stop them!?</p><br/><p>As she basked in the love and respect of the people towards their dictatress, Olivia stepped into the ancient castle of Kaer Morhen. This ancient castle had initially been shabby, desolate, vicissitude. Under Olivia\u2019s reform, it had taken on a fresh, new look. If someone from our day and age ever visited it, they would wonder if they had stepped into a sci-fi world. Are you sure you should be calling this theme \u201cSword and Magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the exterior, it was not all different. It looked just like the castles of the current kings. However, its interior was far comfier.</p><br/><p>Therefore, many often find themselves getting far too comfortable within the ancient walls of Kaer Morhen. They would never want to leave it, as nothing was its equal.</p><br/><p>Whenever Olivia stayed in the best hotels that Novigrad could offer during her business trips \u2013 she had much to complain about. Even the hardened Cirilla expressed that it was nothing like Kaer Morhen\u2026</p><br/><p>Cirilla seemed to have already forgotten her initial misgivings about the ancient castle. The first time she laid eyes upon its walls, she had even wondered if it would collapse while she was in it. She had never expected her omnipotent sister to transform that ruin into heaven on the planet.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. In Cirilla\u2019s eyes, her sister was simply mystical. Be it her communicative abilities, leadership, business equity, creativity, she would never run out of tricks up her sleeves. No one had yet to even gauge her limits!</p><br/><p>Cirilla considered herself to be a clueless barbarian when standing beside her sister. They were flesh and blood, so why were they so different?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Cirilla soon found the meaning of her own existence. As one who practiced \u201cboth magic and physical skills,\u201d she was a force to reckon with on the battlefield. Her potential knew no bounds. She could more than make up for her sister\u2019s lack of melee combat power. A fragile mage would be finished entirely if an enemy closed in. She had gotten this far thanks to her knowledge and magic, and magic generally took the form of a more\u2026 ranged attack. Such was to be expected.</p><br/><p>Cirilla had never thought of Olivia drawing an invisible sword of wind via magic. Weak in melee? Were Jane Doe Su\u2019s sword techniques mere decor?</p><br/><p>Perhaps to Cirilla, her sister had made do with her detailed mastery over magic to break through tight situations. Her sister was so calm and elegant, but also seemed very concerned about having to deal with matters using her own two hands. Therefore, she was always surrounded by heavy armored knights. Did this not mean that she was no good in a fist fight?</p><br/><p>This gave Cirilla a sense of purpose. She would be her sister\u2019s bodyguard. She could cover it all with her \u201cflash\u201d ability.</p><br/><p>Upon returning to the ancient castle, Olivia lay back on the soft sofa, no longer caring about her image. Then, an elf maid donned in a seductive maid uniform made tea for both Princess Olivia and Princess Cirilla\u2026</p><br/><p>The idea of having maids serve them had been Olivia\u2019s. She was a master of such luxurious indulgement. Great leaders needed handmaidens to tend to them, from head to toe. Besides, if one did not use their wealth to improve the quality of one\u2019s life, what use would there be for money?</p><br/><p>Geralt immediately stepped out to greet his two returning daughters. On his face was an uncharacteristic, extremely rare tender smile. This was most likely due to Yennefer\u2019s impending approach. He hoped that his daughters would get along well with his lover.</p><br/><p>His smile threw the girls off. They had never seen him so excited, not even when Triss came. Was this the legendary power of true love?</p><br/><p>Olivia was a master at putting on airs. It was time to organize a welcoming night party for Yennefer just like they did for Triss\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

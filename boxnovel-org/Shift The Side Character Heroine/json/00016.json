Non-existent\u201d.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was pretty much aware of her faint presence, still, when she heard such words babbling out from this feller, she was indeed eager to ask him if he had lost his mind.</p><br/><p>Anyway, she took a deep breath and responded calmly, \u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t know me, so be it. Let us reintroduce ourselves. I\u2019m Zhao Youyue, one within this class. My dear classmate Han Leng, do you remember me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng squinted his eyes. The side face of this bobbed-hair girl was bathed right in the middle of the sunset light. She was so beautiful! The way she spoke was in such a placid tone which was unexpectedly calm, not to mention, her voice was fairly tender.</p><br/><p>This girl\u2019s temper was as decent as the usual\u2026 Meanwhile, Han Leng had even caught a whiff of her fragrance, which smelled light and distant, just like the scent that was once in his memory.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Han Leng did not completely forget Zhao Youyue, and deliberately spoken out such words. As for now, he was wondering why a gorgeous and serene like Zhao Youyue, could be so unremarkable in her life.</p><br/><p>Perhaps if she was a little more irritable and willful, would her sense of presence come by?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I usually will not remember the names of ordinary people, as it\u2019s meaningless. Well, ordinary people have no life goals nor individual traits, and so, their adulthood will usually be dull and colorless. They live their whole life as if they are not living. What\u2019s the meaning of life? It\u2019s to wander around the world in exile, and seek all sorts of excitements.\u201d Han Leng sneered after yawning again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just glossing over the fact that you haven\u2019t found a place you\u2019re willing to stay. What\u2019s with those talks about wandering is the true meaning of life\u2026\u201d Zhao Youyue explained. Her voice was as peaceful as always, as if nothing on earth could agitate her.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Zhao Youyue\u2019s response, Han Leng gazed at her in amazement, and an instinctive feeling rose upon him, that this girl was not that as simple he thought she was.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue then continued, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t remember my name, I\u2019m used to that. I\u2019m here to ask you, can you help me write a remorse letter of 3,000 words? It\u2019s to reflect the wrongdoings of scrolling my phone in the morning reading class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng\u2019s face became sullen that before, as he had taken Zhao Youyue\u2019s request as a humiliation. Does he look like a person who helps to write remorse letter on behalf of others? He did help out to write love letters previously, but that was a romantic matter. It could also be used as a chance to demonstrate his talent in writing anyways. Well\u2026. It would be better if he could conquer girls via his love letters, should that happen, he would have laid down with all his favorite girls.</p><br/><p>Thus, Han Leng declined resolutely, \u201cI\u2019ll rather jump down from the window and die, than write remorse letter for anyone. That\u2019s wasting my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>On perceiving Han Leng\u2019s firm refusal, Zhao Youyue\u2019s heart was full of anxiety. Does she really need to write that on her own?</p><br/><p>Still, she flew his kite, \u201c300 bucks, what if I offer 300 bucks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng\u2019s cold attitude changed drastically, he even conceded on the dot and said, \u201cI\u2019ll write! When do you need it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Zhao Youyue\u2019s startled face, he coughed once and turned his head slightly. He then explained, \u201cIn future, I will be a novelist whose words are worth thousands. But now, I\u2019m still lacking of maturity. For my webnovel in serialization, it has worth up to 50 bucks per 1,000 words. But, the theme of remorse letter is quite different, and you\u2019ve offered me 100 bucks per 1000 words, I consider the price quite reasonable. Anyway, I\u2019m quite confident in writing a remorse letter too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had a sudden urge to ask, \u201cHmm\u2026 Who was the one that said he would rather die than writing a remorse letter?\u201d In the end, she responded gently with a tranquil smile, \u201cAs soon as possible, should you finish it by today, I will pay you 500 bucks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great deal! Zhao Youyue, I think if you\u2019ve looked up to me since junior high, I\u2019ll definitely remember your name.\u201d Han Leng\u2019s face was no longer cold, and a devious smile was seen instead. He even wanted to pat Zhao Youyue on her shoulder, but looking at her blue-and-white school sports attire which was spotlessly clean, he pulled back his hand.</p><br/><p>Not until now, he discovered that Zhao Youyue is different from all the other girls. Her skin is fair and tender; her eyes, big and innocent; and her black bobbed hair is smooth and silky too. He suddenly felt pity for her. Well, to him, if Zhao Youyue has kept a long hair, she will not go through lower visibilities like now, and could even attract men easily whenever she goes.</p><br/><p>Some girls are pretty much suitable for long hair, and sometimes, a sole change in their hairstyle will level up their appearance in the eyes of others.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou took this as a respect? Shouldn\u2019t scholars like you have no worries about money issues?\u201d Zhao Youyue chuckled. She looked even cuter right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, not about that, but you respect my dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always forgotten about the secular world, and the brevity of life, and all the beautiful emotions. Because, I\u2019m thinking\u2026.. that I want to live a despicable and shameless life. This is my dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2018Bonjour Tristesse\u2019 by Francoise Sagan? \u2018The liberty to think, even to think wrongly or not at all, the freedom to choose my own life, to choose myself; for I was only soft clay, but still I could refuse to be moulded.[1]\u2019 Ahh, it\u2019s tiring to speak to a scholar like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Han Leng was utterly dumbfounded, you can actually read the \u201chow-could-one-like-you-have-read-her-book\u201d sentence expressed on his face. Undeniably, he would never forget this girl named \u201cZhao Youyue\u201d again, he had even regretted that he had not known her earlier. Such a girl with depth! How had her entire person not display a single trace of literary temperament? What\u2019s with the old saying \u201cOne who reads more books will naturally emits a brilliance aura\u201d [2]?</p><br/><p>Paying no heed to Han Leng\u2019s astonishment, she took out her phone and asked in a casual manner, \u201cDid you bring your phone? Let me pay you 300 bucks first, Wechat or Alipay [3]?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy gosh, can you don\u2019t act like you\u2019re buying vegetables on the street, keep it low, keep it low please! Anyway, wasn\u2019t your phone confiscated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, well\u2026 I\u2019ve purchased a new one at noon that day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Tycoon\u2026can I be your friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, add my Wechat, or QQ.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy phone is left in the dorm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom your cold and arrogant look, I had taken you as a brave man, to think that you\u2019re such a coward\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch, that\u2019s heart aching Tycoon. Believe it or not, I\u2019m not going to help you on the remorse letter anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh really? Then I\u2019ve no choice but to save some money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it Tycoon! Not only my every word is worth a thousand, but my promises too .\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, stop calling me Tycoon, I\u2019m not eating any sand[4]. Remember my name, it\u2019s Zhao Youyue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the rest of my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Han Leng who turned clumsy from grim, Zhao Youyue continue to giggle, right now, one could feel a sensation of a graceful missy coming from her. Wait, she was already a graceful missy at the first place!</p><br/><p>She took a pen from Han Leng\u2019s table and wrote her Wechat ID on his notebook, and then walked away without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Han Leng took a deep breath and muttered, \u201cSuch fragrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the exquisite handwritings on his notebook, he slapped his own blushed face. All his drowsiness was pretty much gone!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] A famous quote in the novel \u201cBonjour Tristesse\u201d written by Francoise Sagan.</p><br/><p>[2]  \u2013 One who reads more books will naturally emits a brilliance aura, is a Chinese old saying.</p><br/><p>[3] In today\u2019s China, the people makes most payment and fund transfer via Wechat (a social application) or Alipay (an online wallet).</p><br/><p>[4] \u201cTycoon\u201d \u2013 \u201c\u201d the first word of the original chinese letter,  means sand or land.

Did the author had an instinct that Zhao Youyue had the ability to enter the realm of novels, worrying that she could ravage his creation?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue regarded this as an unnecessary worry. She would not sabotage the works within her favorite list, in fact she would use her ability to make it even more iconic! In reality, she would hard sell Rosemary\u2019s creations to others and even convince Su Li to draw a manga of it, solely to multiply the influence of the works.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue complained to Su Li that she could not reach Rosemary for the past few days, she even tipped the author, is asking for a cameo\u2026 too much?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! It\u2019s reasonable for a Sect Masters to demand a came or become a group admin, I would have responded to their requests without qualms. Not to mention that I\u2019m drawing mangas, adding a cameo is definitely easier for a novelist. How dared Rosemary to ignore such a little request, it\u2019s unforgivable!\u201d Su Li went along with Zhao Youyue after hearing her complain. She thought to herself, \u201cOh Rosemary, you never know what golden opportunity you have missed, I\u2019m gonna get on the good side of this rich lady, and ensure she is always my number one fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not I ask for you instead? We\u2019re in the same group, he will at least listen to what I say, tell me your request,\u201d Su Li said.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d, Zhao Youyue suddenly saw a silver living, she liked Su Li even more now.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust tell me, you are my number one Sect Master, I must at least be able to fulfill such a small request!\u201d, Su Li emphasized on Zhao Youyue\u2019s status as her number one Sect Master, hoping that she would keep it that way.</p><br/><p>Not really expecting it to work, Zhao Youyue answered, \u201cJust name this female cameo \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, the rest is not really important. Oh wait, it\u2019s best if she uses a \u201cSwordmistress\u201d in game, and her IGN will be \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d.</p><br/><p>While she was talking, she took a notepad from her bag, and wrote down the cameo\u2019s name and game ID. She then tore that page and handed it over to Su Li.</p><br/><p>After seeing the paper, Su Li questioned out of concern, \u201cWhat about her identity and character settings? Or any special abilities\u2026\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m already satisfied if she can make an appearance in the book, I\u2019m not asking for a side character anyway.\u201d She shook her head.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue thought to herself, that she could easily add her character settings and ability once she \u201cpossessed\u201d Yu Shengfan in the literary world.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me, a cameo with a mere name is a piece of cake\u201d Su Li promised confidently</p><br/><p>Looking at the confident look of Su Li, Zhao Youyue could not help teasing her, \u201cMaster Su, you had also promised the fans that \u201cPure Romance\u201d would have a happy ending too. IN the end, all characters met each other happily in hell. Don\u2019t you end up not getting my cameo, yet making others dislike you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li blushed, \u201cProbably not. Though I rarely chatted in the \u2018Lone Elderly Club\u2019 group, but I was always peeking. I noticed that Rosemary has a good temper. The Gods of Mangas and Novels who are single always like tease Rosemary, but I\u2019ve never seen him enraged even once. He would still invite those people for gaming. Besides, I heard that he is pretty skillful at games. He is usually the MVP of the team, and a lot of players who want to raise their game rankings would like to follow him.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Su Li\u2019s words, Zhao Youyue was rest assured. She was indeed satisfied with her first meet up with Su Li.</p><br/><p>Both of them appeared to be quite congenial with each other, and parted their own way after having dinner together. Zhao Youyue wanted to pay for the bill but Su Li insisted that she would pay it instead, after all it was her idea to invite Zhao Youyue for a dinner.</p><br/><p>Even though Su Li was a gold digger, and a person who likes money, but she also knew the basic manners. Her poor family condition had polished her edges and corners.</p><br/><p>What amused Zhao Youyue was that Su Li took a picture of them both, in front of the limo, and made sure the car number plate 58888 was visible in it.</p><br/><p>Su Li did not own a car, she came here with a cab, so Zhao Youyue suggested that she could send her back to her work office. She declined the offer politely even though she wanted to sit in one of these cars.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was smart enough to look through her gesture. She then smiled at Su Li and dragged her onboard the car.</p><br/><p>Su Li felt like as if she was one of the rich ladies as well, to be able to befriend such fair, rich and beautiful Lady Zhao. It almost felt like a dream comes true, she was not wrong to choose the path of a mangaka. She wanted to repay Zhao Youyue in future with mangas of better quality!</p><br/><p>When Su Li got back to her place, she began to read \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d suggested by Zhao Youyue. It almost had 400,000 words in it but to someone like Su Li who finds inspiration from webnovels, it would be a piece of cake to finish it in a day, if it was really interesting just like what Zhao Youyue mentioned.</p><br/><p>Su Li did not forget to take selfies with Zhao Youyue while she was in the limo, she even took pictures of the interior of the car. Both of them looked just like best friends, nobody would have guessed that one is the mangaka while one is the mangaka\u2019s manga female protagonist.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! I still haven\u2019t known how old are you after all the time we\u2019ve spent together, you\u2019re\u2026 university student?\u201d Su Li asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m only 16, I\u2019ve just finished my first semester in high school.\u201d She replied with a gentle smile on her face.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s eyes goggled, with her jaw opened widely. She would never expect Zhao Youyue to be only 16! Her gestures and way of talking were just too mature and decent, even her outfit did not look like a high schooler!</p><br/><p>Anyway, the moment together with Zhao Youyue was very comfortable for Su Li. It was like enjoying a breeze under the sun\u2026</p>\n</div>"}

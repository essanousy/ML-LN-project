They held each other\u2019s hands and walked to the classroom, together.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan was most definitely unaccustomed to being treated so intimately. As it was Zhao Youyue, she had no way of refusing.</p><br/><p>Neither could she deny the truth spoken by Zhao Youyue. Before she met Zhao Youyue, she had no clue about beautifying herself. She had no such intentions, either. But after she did \u201cit,\u201d out of respect for her friend, she unknowingly became a Goddess-level girl</p><br/><p>If Bai Yunshan had any desire of becoming pretty, she might have been ecstatic to be in such a position. Even to most girls, it would be like a shortcut to the counterattack of their lives, to be able to mix with Zhao Youyue. It would change their whole person to be more beautiful, more attractive, and with more temperament.</p><br/><p>But Bai Yunshan was indifferent about the whole thing. She had only been going through the motions out of respect for their friendship.</p><br/><p>If Zhao Youyue had not cut her hair short, just like the first half of the semester, Bai Yunshan might not have felt so inexplicably nervous, as if God had cheated her of something. No matter what Bai Yunshan undergoes to become a Goddess, she would still definitely pale in comparison to that version of Zhao Youyue. She would only serve as Zhao Youyue\u2019s foil when placed beside her.</p><br/><p>But now, when walking together with Zhao Youyue, she was an MT,[1] taking all the hits meant for Zhao Youyue. Almost everyone\u2019s attention was focused on her. Zhao Youyue had successfully melded into another surrounding object</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was such a minuscule existence.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan had been perplexed over the change of things. To her, Zhao Youyue had always seemed to enjoy the limelight very much. Why the sudden change in pace?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you actually cut your hair short to stay close to me in public occasions as well?\u201d Bai Yunshan seemed to have figured out something, and the dawning of a new discovery shone in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was slightly stunned. She had cut her hair short to alleviate her weariness of being the heroine. She was way too popular on the internet. The paparazzi would sneak in candid shots wherever she went. This was so annoying. Thus, she switched the \u2018passerby status\u2019 on to seek for a refuge. The \u2018heroine\u2019 status switch would always be within an arm\u2019s length, to be used whenever she decided to get involved in another wave of affairs.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue heard what Bai Yunshan said, and responded deftly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I was thinking. Shan Shan, you might be worried that your awkwardness around people may affect me. But from now in, you need not worry anymore. You\u2019ll be crowned as a monarch, and I\u2019ll be hiding in the dark, assisting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan faintly rolled her eyes. She wanted nothing more than to have Zhao Youyue restore all that warm fuzz she had been feeling moment ago. Why couldn\u2019t she just talk nicely?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue must have read some sort of novel again. Nobody spits out such cheezy, pubescent lines at random.</p><br/><p>Even so, Bai Yunshan was relieved after figuring out why Zhao Youyue had cut her hair short. Her apprehension died off. She said, \u201cOf course I\u2019d still be awkward. I won\u2019t tolerate anything that doesn\u2019t fit my mind, and I\u2019m not planning on changing that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue spoke from her heart, \u201cSo you do know why people avoid you.\u201d Bai Yunshan was not asking for much, but she still would not compromise. If she compromised, she would no longer be Bai Yunshan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re now the number one beauty in school. You\u2019re the school flower. A school flower can unquestionably choose not to tolerate anything that doesn\u2019t fit her mind. Many would admire you; many would recognize and accept every bit of your character, whatever that is unbecoming about you would turn into the source of your charm. They would be willing to change for you!\u201d said Zhao Youyue in a delightful tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m still me.\u201d Bai Yunshan felt that Zhao Youyue was trying way too hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a world that looks at faces. The value of appearance is justice. You were unrighteous, and now you are!\u201d said Zhao Youyue confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow shallow! There is so much more to that\u201d Bai Yunshan tried to correct Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how do you explain this situation we find ourselves in? Everyone has only spotted you, not me. I\u2019m supposed to have superior results and a way with music. I\u2019ve only changed my hairstyle, and everyone doesn\u2019t recognize me anymore. Now, they all want to know you.\u201d said Zhao Youyue, a knowing smile on her face.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan simply could not accept such a fact. But there it was, before her very eyes.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Bai Yunshan fell into silence.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue surveyed the silent girl, and was pleased. She was particularly proud of her stealth and deceptive passerby status. She continued, \u201cIf someone really recognizes me at a glance, and totally ignores you, I\u2019d eat\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, Lady Zhao, nice to see you. It looks like you\u2019ve changed your hairstyle.\u201d Han Leng bumped into them. He looked past the beautiful girl Bai Yunshan, and took the initiative to greet Zhao Youyue. After all, they were former classmates and deskmates.</p><br/><p>Despite the flippant nature of that line, it had been a most strenuous exertion for Han Leng. He had almost worked up all his nerves to walk up to Lady Zhao and greet her. He might have become the super popular youth writer Leng Zi, but Lady Zhao still reduced him into jellybeans and marshmallows.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Zhao Youyue\u2019s smugness was smashed to pieces. It had left her slightly embarrassed, in front of Bai Yunshan, no less. It greatly displeased her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue saw that Han Leng had changed a lot. He had grown a lot taller. He was not in a school uniform, but some very fashionable, well-matched set of clothes that gave her a Deja Vu. Then, she remembered. These were the very clothes that she had suggested Han Leng buy. Not bad. He finally looked like a human. After all, it was upon her suggestion.</p><br/><p>Han Leng\u2019s innocent, young and handsome appearance was enough to enrapture countless female fans. It did almost no \u2018damage\u2019 to Zhao Youyue. She was the one who had bestowed this power upon him. You see, Lady Zhao\u2019s words never bore any ill-will, they were all for your own good.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, great scholar Han. Congratulations on your new work, I head it\u2019s another best-seller!\u201d Zhao Youyue bit back her displeasure and replied with an impeccable smile on her face.</p><br/><p>Standing at the sidelines, Bai Yunshan felt that Han Leng was a rather complex character. He had some good taste, too.</p><br/><p>Before Han Leng, the two girls had walked past several other former classmates. They had all ended up ignoring Zhao Youyue. Han Leng was the only person who had recognized Zhao Youyue. On top of that, he had even ignored Bai Yunshan.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan still remembered something that happened at the end of last semester. A senior from the twelfth grade pulled off a grand, confession ceremony. She had driven her sports car to school and confessed to Han Leng. Apparently, she was an actual Lady. A professional dancer. She had been contracted to an agency and would be having her debut as part of an idol group.</p><br/><p>In the end, Han Leng the great scholar, the one who earned the ire of all other male students, rejected her outrightly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know you.\u201d The senior eventually gave up.</p><br/><p>This matter had even become entertainment news, and once gained the third place on Weibo\u2019s hot search results. Han Leng gained more fame, and along the way, more female fans. They felt that he was just like his name, so cool, so icy. He was a so-called \u201cClueless Chick Magnet\u201d[2]. There and then, many passionate female fans had set a life goal. They coveted for Han Leng\u2019s heart\u2026</p><br/><p>The other men only accused Han Leng of showing off. They barked that Han Leng was doomed to have a lonely life. That girl had already taken things to such an extent, yet he still rejected her. She was an absolutely stunning one, too. What a waste!</p><br/><p>Others asked Han Leng, \u201cWho do you actually know, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>The world knows me not.</p><br/><p>My eyes only know you.</p><br/><p>And who are you?</p><br/><p>A Goddess.</p><br/><p>The one who haunts my dreams and my days, my Aphrodite.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] MT \u2013 MT is an acronym for \u201cMain-Tank\u201d or \u201cMonster-Tank.\u201d It refers to a central player in an MMORPG game that draws the monsters\u2019 aggro towards himself, making himself the monsters\u2019 target, and withstands all the attacks.</p><br/><p>[2] Clueless Chick Magnet \u2013 A character who is his own worst enemy when it comes to love. In fact, he\u2019s pretty much his only enemy in this arena. Wherever they go, it seems that for some reason they attract some romantic attention, in theory there is no reason why they couldn\u2019t go on to be with a new person every night. The only problem is they are so unfamiliar with the dating scene they don\u2019t realize the girl who is hovering around him, batting her eyes, trying every excuse to make physical contact with them and suggesting they go back to her place qualifies as flirting and not simply being friendly.

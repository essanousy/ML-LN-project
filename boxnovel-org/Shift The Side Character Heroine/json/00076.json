Her aunt Zhao Jiajia was usually the last to arrive, just because her husband Zhang Zhiyuan and their daughter Zhang Wanjun would always stop by the memorial park to visit his late parents before going to their old home.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhiyuan came from a poor family, and he had no close relatives to depend on. He had a passion for his career. Sadly, he did not inherit his success from the Zhao\u2019s family even though he was very close to them. But, he did have a stable husband and wife relationship with Zhao Jiajia, and was indeed a great son in law.</p><br/><p>Of course, they were nothing compared with Zhao Youyue\u2019s spoiled parents, as both of them were supposed to only exist in the Two Dimensional World, especially her mom, but Zhao Youyue was already gotten used to this since young.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had her own room too in this ancestral home. Her antique boudoir had a bed with redwood frame. Indeed she felt like as if she had gone back to the old times whenever she entered the room.</p><br/><p>They had several modern Han\u2019s costumes and a traditional costume from the past, and would usually wear it when they were worshipping their ancestors. Not everyone would wear the traditional Han costume during New Year\u2019s, as others might be thought of it as some sort of cosplay in public.</p><br/><p>Some items that laid around had certainly ruined the antique atmosphere in the house though. For example, the air-conditioner in the living room, a computer and a modern television, along with some other advanced electronics.</p><br/><p>Grandpa Zhao Rongchun was very fond of Zhao Youyue, but he loved her cousin Zhao Hao even more. He was the grandson of Zhao Rongchun and the only son of Zhao Jiaren, an extremely rich 2G.</p><br/><p>He was studying abroad and had returned home after graduation, obviously going to inherit his father\u2019s business. Zhao Hao\u2019s relationship with the richest man\u2019s son, Ding Yuncong was not too bad as well.</p><br/><p>At first Ding Yuncong said that he did not mind whether his friends were poor or rich, simply because none of them was richer than him. He never actually replied Zhao Hao when he asked, \u201cHow about me?\u201d.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong had his own Esports team named \u201cIG\u201d, and they had a pretty good reputation. So Zhao Hao, whom people often called him \u201cBoss Hao\u201d, made his own Esports team as well, named \u201cKing\u201d, but no one has ever heard of it in game. He also had a \u201cKing\u201d basketball team, because he liked to play basketball.</p><br/><p>Besides that, he also loved to play games, and would spend almost millions on it. Compared with Zhao Youyue who only tipped authors on the Qidian website, others might think of her as a tycoon, but in reality she was only a fraction of her cousin\u2019s wealthiness.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao\u2019s father, Zhao Jiaren was a genuine capitalist. His corporation had shared on Internet companies like Tencent and NetEase. So indirectly, Zhao Hao was actually helping his father to earn more income, as he spent more money on the net company.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not sure how rich her uncle was, but he definitely owned a private plane and even a fancy yacht. Money was just a figure to him. Her uncle could spend it however he wished as he could earn it back in no time. Of course, this could influence the economic growth too.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not have much interaction with her cousin Zhao Hao, but Zhao Hao was very close to her other cousin Zhang Wanjun. While Wanjun was studying in Shanghai, her cousin Zhao Hao was the CEO of YangTian investment company in Shanghai Changning District.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue just woke up from her long tiring journey, she took up her phone and started to read her QQ message. It did not matter where she was, as long as she could use her phone, she would be able to enjoy herself. She noticed that Qidian had a notification on the latest update of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d at 5.00 pm, and she opened up Qidian immediately to read the updates of the latest two chapters.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhao Youyue was a little depressed about Rosemary when he did not send her a request, however, she would still read his books because it was interesting. Zhao Youyue would not hesitate to give up on a book which she found it boring, even though if it was written by an author with a good reputation. She would probably tip the author for one last time, but not post any comments about how boring that book was, after all Zhao Youyue was not that kind of person who liked to hurt others.</p><br/><p>She had finished the first chapter with satisfaction, but when she continued to read the second chapter, she held her forehead, just when she saw the appearance of a female character\u2026Yu Shengfan! She was supposed to be happy because Su Li had successfully fulfilled her request for a female cameo from Rosemary. \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d finally had one female character, and could now shift herself into Yu Shengfan and create a female version of \u201cHuang Shaotian\u201d. The character might not be able to become a memorable iconic character, but making her a popular side character should not be a problem.</p><br/><p>The appearance of Yu Shengfan was downright awkward to read, even though she knew that it was probably Rosemary\u2019s good intent, but his description of this female character was just unbearable. His description for Yu Shengfan was just like Mary Sue, only without rainbow colored hair and pupils, as well as that stupid long name from another parody novel\u2026</p><br/><p>Besides that, people were short of breaths and protagonist Lin Feng had to keep himself cool. Not only that, Tang Yongkai was already drooling like a pig, as if she was a pornstar character!</p><br/><p>There were too many flaws that she could not even know where to begin. Why did \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d went to a cyber cafe with a limo, even though she was filthy rich. In reality, even a gorgeous girl could not even attract so many attention in a cyber cafe, as they would get yelled at for sure if they ever disturbed a gamer!</p><br/><p>The appearance of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d would surely make her impression a negative 20, even though she had yet to do anything in the novel. This had increased the difficulty for Zhao Youyue to clean up the mess as she had no choice but to possess Yu Shengfan.</p><br/><p>Rosemary could have just written that \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d had appeared in the novel, and this would have saved her from a lot of troubles. Zhao Youyue was annoyed.</p><br/><p>After she was done reading in Qidian, Zhao Youyue opened up her QQ again. There were a lot of new mails piling up here and there, including a friend request from Rosemary.</p>\n</div>"}

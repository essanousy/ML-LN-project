Today, she had the opportunity to be involved in the opening ceremony for the Autumn sports competition with alacrity. While she was busy thinking on how to spend the next day leisurely, she received an athlete\u2019s bib from Bai Yunshan, and was told that it was to be attached to the back of her shirt tomorrow for the race\u2026</p><br/><p>What on Earth was going on? There was no way that a pampered girl like Zhao Youyue could run long distance laps. She did not even exercise often, and was not even athletic. She was not being modest about it, the fact was that, she really cannot run!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had initially been in a pretty good mood, as the opening ceremony had gone well and was rather entertaining. The participants had to parade in front of the stage and shout things out like \u201cGood day Chief\u201d as well as many other things related to \u201cserving the nation\u201d and such. At that moment, they were playing as soldiers.</p><br/><p>The principal of the school had probably dreamed of becoming someone big, like a supreme leader of a country, but he had only ended up becoming a principal. It seemed like he was using the students as substitutes for the citizens that he once dreamt of ruling over.</p><br/><p>Everyone was in a relaxed mood, as the monthly examinations had just ended. As that disaster had been averted, nobody had hung up over it anymore. Everyone just wanted to relax and have a good time.</p><br/><p>This sports event would be the best way for everyone to lighten up. A few sneaky couples have even made plans on how to use this time to meet up with each other.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue had also made her own plans as to how she would enjoy this free time. She had planned to play some mobile games, and surf the internet in order to find another story that she would be interested in. She has been planning to look for a piece of literature which wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to handle, as she was definitely not ready to take on something of a high difficulty yet\u2026</p><br/><p>She was prepared to prioritize on works that were already popular, to begin with. This time, as she had randomly entered \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d, which was already fairly popular by itself, the whole process had been really efficient. She was able to transmigrate into that world and emerge successfully, in the blink of an eye. It was so much easier, as long as she does not fool around, she can work the popularity of the book to her advantage.</p><br/><p>Evidently, she did pretty well. Within a month, she had been able to make \u201cZhou Chun\u201d a highly popular character. Rumors have surfaced that a large number of fat otakus had fallen for the dorky lolita \u201cZhou Chun.\u201d They were all on board the opinion that elementary school students were just too great, too awesome!</p><br/><p>Fat otakus. They do their part. Unable to resist lolitas, especially if they were as playful as Xiao Chun. They wanted to hug her tightly and squeeze her so bad! They were more than willing to be victims of her sarcasm!</p><br/><p>These fat otakus are just that cute!</p><br/><p>The sarcastic young lady Xiao Chun had become rather famous on the internet, mostly due to her sarcasm, and also because people were frequently using her sticker packs. As a result of her popularity, her mini 4WD cars were also selling like hotcakes. Some dedicated car collectors would instantly buy the newest cars upon its release, and some of them had even claimed that Xiao Chun\u2019s mini 4WD cars moved a lot faster in the real world! In addition to that, they could even use Xiao Chun\u2019s special deadly move \u2014- \u2014- human and car as one, Angry Crow Takes Flight!</p><br/><p>Even side-displays such as pillows featuring her silly pet husky also sold unexpectedly well.</p><br/><p>The investors of \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d, from the company that produced mini 4WD cars, were of course happy about this news, and went on to praise the scriptwriter, Tian Jun for being so creative in making the character Xiao Chun as well as the ingenious plot. Little did they know, Tian Jun creativity wick was short, and had been completely burned out</p><br/><p>In the future, whether it comes to designing car models, or coming up with sarcastic remarks, all of it would fall on Tian Jun\u2019s shoulders, and he would be on his own. This gave him a headache, and he even thought of killing off Xiao Chun right away, but he would never be able to bring himself to do it.</p><br/><p>Firstly, these kinds of animes that were catered towards children did not permit any sort of killing. Secondly, the investors had already seen how Xiao Chun helped to largely promote the sales of mini 4WD cars, hence she definitely had to be kept alive in everyone\u2019s minds. Initially, it was still remained unclear as to who the female lead was, but now, without any doubt, it was definitely Xiao Chun!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue was too shocked, she had unintentionally raised her voice a little, thus drawing attention from everyone else.</p><br/><p>Frowning, Bai Yunshan said, \u201cYou signed up for this long ago, alright? I even confirmed it with you, and you had nothing to say back then. The competition is tomorrow, and you suddenly have a problem with things now? Are you purposely trying to make trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not remember Bai Yunshan asking her about any sort of confirmation that involved participating in running long laps. At that time, she had been lost in thought over something</p><br/><p>She could have sworn that she never signed up for the race. Why is she suddenly a participant?</p><br/><p>At this moment, after hearing Zhao Youyue\u2019s voice, Xie Ting immediately bobbed up and hatefully said, \u201cYou must be toying with Zhao Youyue on purpose. She obviously doesn\u2019t know anything, yet you still signed her up for this running competition, just because you are jealous that she is prettier, smarter, and more popular than you. If the class is given an opportunity to vote for a class representative, everyone would definitely vote for Zhao Youyue, and not a snitch like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Ting had truly become her unwavering fan. For Zhao Youyue, she did not care about anything else and would go all out.</p><br/><p>Her lack of concern for her surroundings notwithstanding, this act of hers still caused the majority of people in the class to take her side. When everyone found out that Zhao Youyue had been pitted to run the 800m, 1500m, as well as the 3000m long distance laps, they all felt that Bai Yunshan was deliberately targeting her. Surely, Zhao Youyue was not the type of person who could run, yet the class representative Bai Yunshan had still signed her up for so many events. This was all a show of abusing one\u2019s power to enact revenge!</p><br/><p>Everyone started to discuss amongst themselves, all talking about how unfair things were for Zhao Youyue. Some sympathized with her, while fearing that they might one day be on the same receiving end, should they offend Bai Yunshan\u2026</p><br/><p>Sports commissioner Lu Rui also walked over to help Zhao Youyue fight this unjust. He said to Bai Yunshan, \u201cDid you get things wrong? To compete in so many different races continuously in two days, how could anyone persevere? Why would Zhao Youyue want to torture herself?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Bai Yunshan fully understood how it felt to be deserted by everyone. Even though she was not in the wrong, she felt tears welling up in her eyes. Taking a deep breath, she spoke the truth, \u201cIt was Shen Menglian who helped Zhao Youyue sign up for this. She proclaimed that they were good friends, and that Zhao Youyue had requested her to help her sign up for the races.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Shen Menglian was gleefully standing at the sidelines and rejoicing. She felt that she finally had the both of them in the palms of her hands. Bai Yunshan pleased her the most, as she had actually believed her words. Zhao Youyue, on the other hand, had been so engrossed in mini 4WD cars that she had not been paying enough attention to anything. Thus, Shen Menglian\u2019s scheme went entirely according to plan!</p><br/><p>After hearing Bai Yunshan\u2019s accusation, Shen Menglian angrily raised a finger and loudly said, \u201cBai Yunshan, you are too shameless! You know that Zhao Youyue and I are good friends, why would I want to sabotage her? First, you refuse to admit that you are exacting revenge, and now you are turning around to malign me? Going as far as to sow discord between us, who would have thought that you were such a scheming b*tch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Menglian still had some standing in class, at least more so than Bai Yunshan. Furthermore, just by being Lady Zhao\u2019s lackey, she was able to bask under her shadow and share the glory\u2026</p><br/><p>With that, Bai Yunshan fell into deep trouble!</p><br/><p>Everyone would believe Shen Menglian\u2019s words instead of hers!</p><br/><p>Only Zhao Youyue regarded the \u201cstar actress\u201d Shen Menglian with a contemplative eye.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

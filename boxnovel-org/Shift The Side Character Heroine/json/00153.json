It did not sound like a title of a webnovel. A webnovel with this title would not work out, for sure.</p><br/><p>Obviously, it was not a webnovel. It was bad news again for her, as a top subscriber of Qidian and other online works. She could not \u201ccustom-make\u201d a female cameo which she could easily operate if she is unable to get hold of the author.</p><br/><p>She briefly went through its introduction that looked like Baidu\u2019s Encyclopaedia via the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d. She was very disappointed to find that this was targetted for juveniles.</p><br/><p>It was hopeless. The reputation of juvenile literary works, both novels, and films, have been damaged by \u201cjuveniles\u201d. Such juvenile literary works tended to include elements such as affairs, abortion, love triangle etc., claiming that it is part and parcel of an exciting youth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbortion\u201d, a must-have element in the juvenile films that Zhao Youyue have watched. Back then, she was so exasperated with mankind\u2019s inability to produce any innocent juvenile films. Why must heroine express something in such a way</p><br/><p>As for juvenile literary novels, Zhao Youyue has not read much. However, she knew that such novels were very popular in the physical book market. Unlike other physical novels, they stood strong, despite the trend of webnovels. Every week, may students would buy juvenile romance magazines, such as \u201cMeng Ya\u201d, \u201cZui Novel\u201d, \u201cFiction&amp;Drawing\u201d, \u201cHua Huo\u201d etc.</p><br/><p>Her peers from the same class were obsessed with them. Even the Little Angel, Jiang Qing, who sat beside her would buy \u201cMeng Ya\u201d on a weekly basis. For her case, that would be understandable, \u201cMeng Ya\u201d sales have always been excellent, as it is published weekly in this world.</p><br/><p>Latecomers could not overcome the urge to join in. The magazine\u2019s New Concept Essay Competition also held significant influence.</p><br/><p>Therefore, here, \u201cMeng Ya\u201d is the most sought-after juvenile literature magazine. Zhao Youyue was unsure if \u201cMeng Ya\u201d serialized \u201cBeautiful April\u201d. If so, she would feel relieved, as this indicated that it would easily become popular. Hence, the character she was in would easily become an icon too.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, she could only keep cursing \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d for sending her to such uncharted waters. Anyhow, if this does not become popular, she would withdraw ahead of schedule, and ruin it in a way that would leave readers dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>For instance, if she is a female alien spy character who has the ability to produce alien eggs, she would incubate the egg in the male protagonist and turn him into an alien too. Eventually, the world would become the home for aliens</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it interesting to alter the plot of a juvenile literature novel?</p><br/><p>However, the author would certainly drop such a notion. Unlike Lin Jianzhong, they would question their own minds for having such ideas.</p><br/><p>Juvenile literature novels are popular in the physical book market, but not online. They were not like those feel-good literature works.</p><br/><p>These novels always enjoyed sending their readers into despair. Tragic ends would also befall the male and female main characters who loved each other. After all, youth is a mixture of joy and sorrow. At that stage of their lives, most readers would be filled with angst and rebellious instincts. Such ending would bring forth an indescribable pleasure for the readers.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, only they could understand such pleasure. Therefore, when they reread these novels after becoming adults, an ineffable shame would wash over them\u2014WTF! Such pretentious, plastic literature made me cry back then?</p><br/><p>So embarrassing!</p><br/><p>That is right. Generally, the level of writing in these novels was high. They would be filled with stunning, bombastic phrases. Therefore, many students who mastered writing high school essays would take note of these iconic phrases to impress their teachers.</p><br/><p>Apparently, this was the reason why Han Leng\u2019 students wrote so well. Ever since junior high school, he began to tamper with his writing skills. In addition to that, he was talented in writing, which helped him rank top in the new concept essay competitions.</p><br/><p>Many readers would be willing to buy a great author\u2019s work, even if it is written in a colloquial manner. For instance, Han Leng\u2019s \u201cWeb Game: Dominate the World\u201d. Those lousy authors would definitely ruin such themes.</p><br/><p>However, he had managed to turn it into one of the top novels. How many top novels are there available in Qidian? Hundreds, at most.</p><br/><p>Thus, talent is crucial. Isn\u2019t it talent that turns a passing cameo into a God?</p><br/><p>After Han Leng wrote down the title of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d, he finished it in just three days. Then, many die-hard fans asked him about his next publication, but no feedback was given. He was unsure if he will write webnovels again.</p><br/><p>This work had required him to pass up about 8,000 words draft per week, which was approximately 1,000 plus words a day. When he was a web novelist, at least 4,000 words of draft per day was compulsory, and refinement was impossible. Now, this was merely a day\u2019s update for him.</p><br/><p>This book would probably consist of about 200,000 words. For a webnovel, it would not appear in the VIP section, yet it could be published if it is a physical book.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, for a high school student like himself, writing magazine articles was a good choice. The daily quota was not too heavy. Unfortunately, not everyone is as talented as him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had no clue that \u201cBeautiful April\u201d was a masterpiece of her classmate. After reading its introduction and the characters, she discovered that there were many female characters. Some were merely side characters with names. This could work in her favor.</p><br/><p>This time, she withheld her impulse, but first withdrew from the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d. She intended to read through its serialized parts to better prepare herself. Meanwhile, she would also plan carefully on crafting the ability that she could gain from it.</p>\n</div>"}

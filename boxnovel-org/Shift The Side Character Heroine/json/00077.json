They could use that excuse to play games, play mahjong, daydreaming or even slacking, as if they were very serious towards their work. Zhuge[1] Yue, Saint Yue was already aware of everything.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue knew Rosemary through Su Li, so his \u201cinspiration\u201d definitely would be playing games, but then he wrote about games in his novel, guessed that would not be a major problem after all.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had a big heart, she would not mind the little things that Rosemary annoyed her in the past, and she accepted the friend request of Rosemary. After the approval of the friendship request, Rosemary approached Youyue with enthusiastic greetings.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Youyue, I have added a female cameo in my latest chapter as you requested. I\u2019ve put a lot of efforts and ideas into creating this lady, what are your thoughts?\u201d Rosemary asked.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue saw his message, she let out a helpless sigh. No wonder his fans were strongly against adding female characters. His \u201cefforts and ideas\u201d was hopeless, and he did not realize that himself and felt confident about it. He had no idea that the female characters that he wrote felt exaggerated, she would already get hated by the readers before she even does anything.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could even predict that tonight, the comment sections would be full of hatred and complains. History would repeat itself as Rosemary saw these heated comments on the comment section, he would let the female character disappear as if she never appeared in the book in the first place.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could never allow that to happen under her watch, it would totally ruin her previous efforts of trying to get in contact with Rosemary.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Rosemary, thank you for adding the cameo that I requested. But I have to tell you that the way you wrote about her, was a bit exaggerated. I can suggest a way to write about her without receiving complaints from your fans.\u201d Zhao Youyue replied.</p><br/><p>When Rosemary saw her reply, he got offended. He felt that he failed to humor Zhao Youyue even though he clearly had put all his effort in his creation. He was haughtier than Su Li, he had his own perseverance in his creation, he would not tolerate mindlessly with his readers, not even if they\u2019re a tycoon.</p><br/><p>Of course if it was a suggestion from a tycoon reader, he would pay more attention to the issue.</p><br/><p>This Lady Youyue was not even an author, what makes her think that she could guide him in his writing?</p><br/><p>When he was just about to reply her, Zhao Youyue tipped him 100,000 Qidian coins, for all his efforts on writing this novel. Hoped that he could produce even more interesting plots and stories. If only Rosemary added Zhao Youyue sooner, she probably would have given one million Qidian coins with a Silver Sect Master reward when her mood was good while reading his books.</p><br/><p>He missed that opportunity plus he made the appearance of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d so awful, he only got tipped with 10 RMB. In reality it was 1,000 RMB, but to Lady Zhao, 1,000 RMB was no different than 10 RMB.</p><br/><p>After Rosemary saw her tip records, even though he already knew that she was a fair, rich and beautiful person, he was still devastated by her actions. She tipped him 100,000 Qidian coins without hesitation, and she did not even say a word\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the first time Rosemary had ever encountered such tycoon level reader like Zhao Youyue, she would be the goddess of wealth to all authors!</p><br/><p>Rosemary was stunned by Zhao Youyue\u2019s actions, allowing her continued to reply a message, \u201cI was thinking that Mr. Rosemary can easily make a female character look awesome. Just proceed to write about a male character like you always do, then pretend that he was a female character instead. Relationship with other males would be like brothers, so that the fans will not hate her. Because everyone likes how you portray your male characters.\u201d</p><br/><p>After reading this message, he suddenly felt that there was a light in front of him, as if he realized something. Because he used to portray female characters just for shows without in depth explanation of their backgrounds, and they would fall in love with the main protagonist without reasons\u2026</p><br/><p>As Yu Shengfan was a rich lady, he would write that everyone else was attracted by her beauty except for the protagonist, so she would be curious why he was not interested in her?</p><br/><p>The protagonist would always admire her beauty, as for others, that would be always sexual desires.</p><br/><p>That got him thinking, what if he actually turned Tang Yongkai into a female character? A female character that is fond of the bonds of friendships, will she ever get popular?</p><br/><p>This idea certainly had its own charm!</p><br/><p>Indeed, this was the charm of genderbent!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s suggestion had opened his mind, ready to explore a new world. He even thought that if he was to turned Lin Feng into a female, would it be more interesting? To make this a reality, he would have to depend on \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, he had to guarantee and safeguard her scenes in the novel.</p><br/><p>This was all under the prediction of Zhuge Yue, Saint Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am grateful for your rewards! Your suggestion means a lot to me too, I will try to use that method to describe a female character, there will be no romance in between female characters and protagonist, only pure rivalry.\u201d Rosemary replied happily.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was rest assured after hearing it from Rosemary, but she warned him that he better got prepared to get bash in the comment sections, considered it as to increase his psychological ability to bear with it. She would not want the first female character to go invisible after her first appearance.</p><br/><p>Even though she had a very rough start, Zhao Youyue was determined to possess \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1]Zhuge \u2013 A surname of a brilliant strategist, Zhuge Liang from the Shu faction during the three kingdom era. In this novel it was referred to Zhao Youyue being a wise person.</p>\n</div>"}

The great streamers were probably still asleep. Therefore, many people who had been keeping track of this new DLC opted for Wu Shun\u2019s stream. Watching him getting abused was also a very interesting matter</p><br/><p>After relaunching the game, Wu Shun saw some new DLC-related pop-ups. Even the BGM had changed. He was slightly startled, and spoke to the audiences excitedly, \u201cOld Sly Zha Feng\u2019s game is not a DLC-heavy mess like Paradox Interactive, this DLC seemed to have changed the game entirely. Look at that, even the character models seem different!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs everyone should know, the \u201cTale of Wuxia\u201d series has a special place in my heart. Therefore, I\u2019m extremely acquainted with this game. I\u2019m able to sense even the slightest of changes. Why do I think that the character models are different? In the past, the characters all gave me a dark, lonely vibe. It\u2019s subtle, but my soul sees a great deal of fresh vibrance coming from them now. As expected, this game is a massive game about developing love relationships. Hahaha\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Sly Zha Feng most certainly recruited some new powerful artist. No point guessing who it is right now. When we get through this DLC, all will be revealed!\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Wu Shun went through the new menus and systems at length and in depth. He kept them open long enough to the slowest of readers to keep up, all the while speaking and giving his honest inputs on them. His viewers were pleased. Honest reviews like this one were usually the determiners of their purchases.</p><br/><p>Such was the case for Single-Player games. Players might consider one or two hundred RMB to be very expensive, and would be stuck pondering over it for a long time.</p><br/><p>For mobile games, several rounds of 10x consecutive draws would cost more than a hundred. Fulfilling such impulses was extremely gratifying</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently browsing my original saved files has everyone noticed this additional main storyline quest \u2013 \u201cThe Turbulent Kingdom of Zhao\u201d? It so happens that Su Hu, the monarch of the Kingdom of Zhao, has decided to entrust us to a commission. This new map seems to be the Kingdom of Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, I remember having completed a quest related to the Kingdom of Zhao in the past. That quest seemed to be a generic sidequest. It did not seem to have taken place in the Kingdom of Zhao either. Quest takers back then were fortunate enough to meet the royal members of the Kingdom of Zhao. My only beef with that quest was that all the characters had the same generic placeholder as their faces\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember passing through some in-game books claiming Su Hu to be a tyrant. Yet, the new main storyline quest is coming from this supposed tyrant. I smell a rat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Shun\u2019s words sounded doubtful, but he deftly accepted the quest without any hesitation. Along the way, he consulted the in-game index entry, where past books read in-game would be stored. He found the content related to Su Hu, and showed it to the audiences. Most of it had been written in Classical Chinese.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of \u201cTale of Wuxia\u2019s\u201d merits is the authentic Chinese style. You really feel like you\u2019re living in that time period. Even those mythical monsters roaming about don\u2019t seem out of place. And don\u2019t you love Zha Feng\u2019s contradictory naming sense? For example, those bloody mimics are called Box Fairies. What the hell? They exist solely to express Zha Feng\u2019s malice. I just don\u2019t see any other reason for them to be in the game. But if you insist on talking about the setting of the game, I guess it\u2019s fine to bump into devils and monsters around every random corner \u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Shun read through the records and rumors surrounding Su Hu, sparing nothing from the viewers on how cruel he was, including the record about him being a cannibalistic freak, who even killed and ate his own wife</p><br/><p>Anyhow, these were just written records \u2013 everyone deserved the benefit of doubt. When it came to a quest in a game, anything went, as long as it paid well.</p><br/><p>Wu Shun took his character through the doorway of a posh, high-class inn. Then, he finally met the person who claimed to be a military attache from the Kingdom of Zhao. He carried the official authority look well, and seemed every bit as righteous as one could be. When he met Wu Shun, he asked him respectfully if he was the famous paladin XXX, No. 7 on the Top 10 list, even verbally listing out a long list of his honorary titles.</p><br/><p>This game took pride in its level of detail. Depending on your character\u2019s popularity, NPCs would reeact accordingly. Some quests locked you out completely if you were of insufficient renown.</p><br/><p>The NPC would wave you off in disdain, spouting a line like, \u201cA nobody like you is not worthy of my time.\u201d Even when it came to trading with merchants, reputation came in very handily. Oh, let\u2019s not forget about the female NPCs. In some sidequests, your reputation allowed you to dabble in some adultery as well. That was why some players ridiculed the game as \u201cTale of Wuxia 3: Cannon King of the Nations\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the CG cutscenes were all the same, as generic as the female characters were. It was no different from searching for a prostitute at a brothel. Therefore, it got old pretty quickly.</p><br/><p>Special female characters provided scenes that were of an entirely different level. Players would die a million times just to increase the female characters\u2019 favorability. Increase it enough, and you\u2019ll f*ck them to nirvana. Nothing would get between them. Determination and libido solved everything!</p><br/><p>Being the hero who saved the beauty in a game was also a form of eternal enjoyment. Players still gave such sidequests their all, if it involved a fair maiden</p><br/><p>In reality, the risks pertaining to the liberation of a damsel in distress were steep. Getting into such a situation was highly unlikely, to begin with, as these players were often cooped up at home.</p><br/><p>Wu Shun explored all the dialogue options with this military attache from the Kingdom of Zhao. He was told that an consummately evil monster had appeared in the Kingdom of Zhao. Nobody could determine if it was even human. Several important officers other than Su Hu had already been assassinated, causing the royal administration of the Kingdom of Zhao to enter a state of panic. Under such circumstances, Wu Shun hoped to be able to rescue the Kingdom of Zhao from such disastrous hardship and stop this damned murderer in his tracks. He would be well-rewarded, be it Godly weapons or techniques. He could choose anything he wanted.</p><br/><p>Wu Shun readily accepted the quest. However, just as the two of them made to depart, a bunch of robbers appeared, led by a mini boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just getting started, and we\u2019re already getting mobbed with a freaking mini boss. All this to open the new map. I can\u2019t say that I did not expect Old Sly Zha Feng to do this. I may have once be a newbie who got his ass kicked by the thief boss. That bastard kept me in the novice village for a long time. Well, that was once upon a time, not anymore. Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Shun confidently charged in, moving his character like a fierce tiger. The robbers beat the snot out of him five times before he could even get anywhere close to the mini boss. At that point, he was almost prepared to smash his controller. He said glumly, \u201cAre they really normal robbers? They must be professional soldiers. What rotten luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>After dying eight times, Wu Shun finally defeated the mobs. He soon realized that aggression did not work well against numbers. He had to use the terrain, which had been specially prepared for them. Anyhow, the goal was to prevent them from completing their formation</p><br/><p>The mini boss was relatively easy. Even so, this relatively easy fight killed him another three times. When he finally defeated the boss, he let out a triumphant warcry. No other game gave him such joy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

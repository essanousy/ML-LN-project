He had been defeated by a mysterious, unknown female racer!</p><br/><p>It was not a scheduled, official race, but everyone knew that Xia Hai had tried his very best!</p><br/><p>When they finally took down his race time, it had been faster than the time when he defeated the ex-God racer of Mountain Qilin. His fearsome opponent had forced all the juice out of his body. Even after all that, he had still been utterly defeated. That final drift was the thing of fantasies!</p><br/><p>When the viewers saw the conclusion of the race, they only stood in silence, unable to believe what the big screen had just displayed!</p><br/><p>After that silence, the crowd erupted like a volcano!</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Hai actually lost! He was actually faster than the night he took down a God. Who exactly is that female racer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, what a great day. I\u2019ve just witnessed a tale I could pass down to my grandchildren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too cool! Every drift had been taken to the limit. She basically cheated death at each turn. Such guts, such skill, she simply was born for racing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf anyone tells me in future that drifting is something flashy but useless, I\u2019ll \u2018slap his face\u2019 by showing tonight\u2019s recording! I hereby declare that from today onwards, I\u2019m a loyal fan of that beauty racer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of the other upcoming races of tonight would be worth watching. She\u2019s stolen the limelight. She\u2019s so freakishly fast. How could anyone else compare to that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome come come, where are all the naysayers? Why is it so silent now? You hypocrites, you really don\u2019t know what it means to be a real racer. Never judge a book by its cover!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat chick has serious skills. Don\u2019t forget that the modified car she drove belongs to the ex-God racer of Mountain Qilin. It\u2019s far slower than Xia Hai\u2019s modified car. I heard that they invested over ten million in its build!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBravo, bravo! This female racer deserved the victory!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Most embarrassed were those \u201cXia Hai braggarts.\u201d They made up a good 70~80% of the crowd. Afterall, Xia Hai had toppled a God. He had been in the scene for a long time. People always jumped on the bandwagon and support the reigning champion, even if Xia Hai was a grip racing purist.</p><br/><p>Now, nobody was laughing. This female racer had blown all conventions out the water. Her drifting wasn\u2019t even flashy. It was terrifying, violent and reckless. Doesn\u2019t this remind us of a certain anime character?!</p><br/><p>The famous live streamer \u201cLady Jia Zi\u201d had also fell silent. As Xia Hai maintained his lead, she had never stopped her mouth, saying things such as, \u201cThis is a waste of time,\u201d \u201cThe gap is too big,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s out,\u201d \u201cThe King will definitely win,\u201d etc. She had not stopped for a moment until she had successfully jinxed Xia Hai\u2026</p><br/><p>When Xia Hai was finally overtaken, she had stopped mid-syllable, as if her throat had been plugged by a light bulb. What a biased commentator. A moment ago, she was still bragging about how the reigning champion would keep his crown. At the next moment, the underdog had forced her own words down her throats!</p><br/><p>Viewers truly loved watching live streamers getting slapped in the face. Her bullet curtain became flooded with \u201cLOLs\u201d and \u201cROFLMAOs.\u201d Others spoke up \u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>When I saw that nasty drift, I already gave up on Xia Hai. He was not flashy enough!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey guys. First time visiting this channel. Is this a film or was that races real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s real. You can go to the scene and watch in person. It\u2019s amazing, just like watching an Esports competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does that feel, Jiaxi? Getting slapped in the face? Hahah you wouldn\u2019t stop hyping the King up like a brainless fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m now a fan of that chick. I hereby beg that Lady Jia Zi approach her for an interview!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was truly shocked! That was a scene straight out of an anime. I never expected someone to actually pull it off. She\u2019s simply awesome, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m imagining it, but I feel like I\u2019ve just witnessed Zhao Xiaomei in reality. That violence! That reckless abandonment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who have watched \u201cFast Track: No Limits,\u201d please don\u2019t leave. Let\u2019s cheer for Lady Zhao Xiaomei!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Jia Zi. For your own good, you should follow this extraordinary female racer in the future. She\u2019s faster and flashier than Xia Hai. I don\u2019t see why I have to stay in Xia Hai\u2019s fanclub!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Qian Xiaojia \u2018slapping her own face\u2019 was one thing. It was worth it, seeing how her own live stream shot up to the next level. It exceeded a million views. In her heart, she smiled.Qian Xiaojia saw the requests on the bullet curtain. Among them were several viewers who had donated heavily to her channel. Well, she couldn\u2019t turn them down, now. That woman\u2019s beauty would make her look like a roadside beggar, but she did not care now. Her viewers came first. When she was done with the interview, she would boldly request for due payment\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao finally regained enough sensation in his legs to pull himself out of the car. His face was as white as a ghost, and he was barely conscious. His only thought was \u2014\u2014 This is a f*cking miracle! I still f*cking live!</p><br/><p>Back at the S-curve, he had screamed. It was not a shout of victory, but he was utterly convinced that he was going to die.</p><br/><p>He staggered to the side of the track and emptied his guts out. It was truly great to be alive!</p><br/><p>That was when he felt something off. Something was wet, and it was at his crotch?</p><br/><p>His white face turned green. He scrambled to the toilet, falling over along the way. This was way too embarrassing. He would never sit in his sister\u2019s car again, no matter how curious he was\u2026</p><br/><p>This was not adrenaline. This was life and death. He finally understood the meaning of those phrases such as \u201ca cornered animal is at its most deadliest state,\u201d \u201cThere is little hope of survival.\u201d If someone asked him whether his pampered self had ever experienced despair, he had a certain answer to offer. It had all occurred during a single night, when his sister had taken him on a drive!</p></div>\n</div>"}

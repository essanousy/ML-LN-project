She trained with her sword every morning. Her physical strength was more than enough for military activities. Jane Doe Su\u2019s self-styled sword dance was more than just a show.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue noticed that her skin did not turn dark like the others. Sunblock lotions were only meant to block harmful ultraviolet sunray. Apparently, this was another one of Lady Su\u2019s powers. Otherwise, three weeks would have been enough to turn her into an African native.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue outshone others with her beauty and dedication in military training. Instructor Ma was impressed by her performance, and often asked for her help when it came to demonstrations. Those were the favorite moments of the male students. It was a rare refreshing sight in the midst of all these torturing exercises.</p><br/><p>Boys would always be motivated by the sight of a beautiful girl. A girl watching a game of basketball or football match was a wide-area buff that double every male player\u2019s stats.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not just an ordinary girl. With her in the group, instructor Ma did not face any trouble carrying out his training program. He had been initially warned by his colleagues on how tough it would be to get these university students to move their asses. He was equally worried about the trouble he might get into if he ever got too harsh on the students.</p><br/><p>The first day of military training ended. His worries had been proven to be unfounded. It was time for him to narrow down the candidates for the best soldier. His decision was crystal clear \u2013 and he was certain nobody would question him.</p><br/><p>It was obvious Zhao Youyue outperformed everybody else.</p><br/><p>Instructor Ma could barely remember most of his students, but he could easily close his eyes and recreate Zhao Youyue in her entirety, within his mind!</p><br/><p>For everything she did, Zhao Youyue always had a goal to achieve. She never intended to impress any instructors. It was the same as earning the title of best student in High School. She never aimed for the prize, but the entitlement and special treatment of being the best. People would treat her differently not because of her family background, but because she was the best of the best.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had successfully impressed her instructor. She was granted the choice to stay in the hostel or go back to her house. Since she stayed at home, she prepared her bed with her blanket wrapped over it like a typical soldier\u2019s bed, and a pillow at the end on her bed. After all, she only needed to do it once.</p><br/><p>Therefore, her housekeeping scores were always ten out of ten. Others had to wake up earlier \u2013 just to make their beds right\u2026</p><br/><p>Staying in the hostel for the first few days had been fun. After that, Zhao Youyue started to miss her home. She called her mother Wang Hua, pretending to be homesick. In no time at all, she was on her mother\u2019s car, on the way back to her house. Of course, she was back before daybreak. She would not want to miss a chance for her to build up herself physically.</p><br/><p>Military training in other universities often involved midnight exercises \u2013 simulating emergency responses to night raids. However, Jiangnan University was not as strict. Students could sleep peacefully at night without thinking about rude awakenings.</p><br/><p>Night owls like Zhou Cai, almost relished such training. She might even be wide awake at the sound of the siren.</p><br/><p>Zhou Cai always remained at peak activity until late at night, even if her body exhausted. She was not worried about oversleeping for next day\u2019s training. Zhao Youyue would always wake her up!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue left the hostel before dinner. Her mother Wang Hua fetched her to any restaurant she wanted.</p><br/><p>Wang Hua would always dote on her daughter, despite all the nagging and name-calling. She even satirized the fact that Zhao Youyue had been chosen as the best soldier, but she had abandoned her troops, just because she did not want to make her bed every morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make such hasty conclusions, old mama. I have been praised by instructors and fellow students in training. Not staying in the hostel is no fuss at all,\u201d said Zhao Youyue confidently.</p><br/><p>In fact, the title meant little to her. All she wanted at that moment was a relaxing hot bath. She was a pampered child after all, not the poor girl with a pretty face that could withstand any pressure and hardship. If she had to live that way for a few more days, she would have lost it.</p><br/><p>She laughed when people spoke about \u201cLady\u2019s Zhao determination.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why would she need Xu Jing\u2019s character card if it was commendable?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not some deity. She was just as flawed as any human. She only did a better job of hiding it.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop calling me old mama. Here, have more of these and stop talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hua treated her daughter to a fine dinner. After all the hard training she had gone through, she deserved a consolation.</p><br/><p>Somehow, she was proud of her daughter. She had earned acclaim on her first-day of training and people have started to call her, \u201cGoddess of the Military Training.\u201d Some seniors even went to the camp to find out who she was.</p><br/><p>Even the School magazine society had prepared to interview Zhao Youyue. They planned to post pictures of her on the Jiangnan University website as an advertisement for the university.</p><br/><p>Other prominent societies and clubs in school started to make their move as well. It seemed like everybody wanted Zhao Youyue to be a part of them.</p><br/><p>All, except for the Student Union society. It was the only society with actual influence in the university. Most of the students wanted to be part of it; they craved to be the leaders of the students.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it never needed to come to anyone \u2013 only the opposite.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not interested in joining any societies or clubs. She had the tendency of supporting others on their cause and awarding others for their despicable acts. One particular organization suited her.</p></div>\n</div>"}

No matter how you looked at it, his credentials were rather substantial. After all, not just anyone could gain the acknowledgment of Su Li\u2019s parents. They were dead serious about potential suitors for their outstanding daughter.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Su Li had no interest in marriage. Also, what common ground did she share with an elite investor. She would be the eccentric one out of the pair. Fending him off would be the best option\u2026</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Zhao Youyue was a friendly young girl. She could befriend just about anyone she wanted. There was nothing she could not talk about, and she was never shy to strangers.</p><br/><p>Even eccentric individuals like Han Leng yearned to talk to Lady Zhao. Regular girls bored Han Leng. His attitude was an accurate representation of his name, cold and lonely for all eternity.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was why Han Leng treated Lady Zhao differently. He could not find anyone else who sat on the same page.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao was born with this extraordinary talent of public relationship.</p><br/><p>Su Li excused herself to the ladies, leaving Zhao Youyue to deal with the awkward situation. Well, who asked her to be such a busybody in the first place?</p><br/><p>Yi Renjie was a decent man. At least, that was how he appeared. Nevertheless, he treated this date seriously. He wanted to leave a strong first impression in the heart of a beautiful girl like Su Li.</p><br/><p>Su Li did not want to hurt this man\u2019s feelings. He seemed to be a nice guy. Their parents knew each other as they were from the same town. Going overboard might involve her parents.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue sat before Yi Renjie, making no attempt to hide her annoyance and contempt. He might be an elite in his career, but he was a nobody to her.</p><br/><p>Indeed, nobody could touch the hem of the Zhao Family\u2019s robes, even with whole life\u2019s hard work. Plus, he was not remarkably talented, nor had he been born with a silver spoon in his mouth.</p><br/><p>China was rapidly growing, albeit in a structured and well-planned manner. Under such conditions, the wealthy only grew wealthier. Plebians could only dream of sharing the skyline with them.</p><br/><p>Yi Renjie quickly averted his eyes. He fought to retain his elegant demeanor, not wanting to appear unhinged by Zhao Youyue\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Renjie, isn\u2019t it? Name a price. How much to give up on her.\u201d Zhao Youyue tried to put up her best impression of an overprotective guardian.</p><br/><p>She never had the will or guts to be a mean person. Arrogance was a close substitute.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the way you worded it, it seems like this date had been an automatic fail. Thank goodness!\u201d Yi Renjie spoke as if the weight on his chest had been lifted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that supposed to mean, our Lady Su Li is not good enough for you?\u201d His words triggered Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, I\u2019m just not interested in women\u2026\u201d Unexpectedly, Yi Renjie confessed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue blinked in surprise, \u201cSo, you like men?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s not entirely true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s your preference?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, none whatsoever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what was with that gentlemanly goody act, sister Su did not have the heart to reject you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had to present myself perfectly to imply my lack of interests in her well-being. I satisfy everybody, my parents, and Su Li. A token of respect and courtesy, if you must say. If I cared about her, I would have been nervous and jumpy, you don\u2019t see such composed men on first dates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are so weird. I never thought that guys like you existed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe, but I think it\u2019s completely normal. I just wanted to pass my time. If it actually ended up with something, I would just go with the flow. Who would my bride be? It doesn\u2019t really matter to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you wife cheated on you, it wouldn\u2019t matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. It depends. Maybe not enough for me to throw a fit, but I won\u2019t just leave it be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds awfully like you not giving a damn. You\u2019re letting others take your life out of your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf everyone is happy, why not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s boring. How could that life carry any meaning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the quintessence of human inheritance is to get a wife and create a new line down the family tree. This world needs people to strive for perfection in everything, creating wonders along their way. It needs people like me, keeping the foundations stable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Renjie finished off his sentence by leaving the table for the bill. He apologized to Su Li, saying that they were not meant for each other.</p><br/><p>Yi Renjie knew plenty of girls who did not know how to reject a man.</p><br/><p>Smart ladies left hints. All he had to do was pick up the memo and make his exit. Everyone would leave the place all the merrier.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was right about him being weird. He might be amicable and pleasing to the ladies, but it was all just a facade. His true nature was that of a sadist. Marriage was just a ceremony set upon him by his parents to lengthen the existence of their genealogy. Any healthy female who was capable of bearing offsprings would suffice.</p><br/><p>Pretty ladies came to him all the time. He came from a rather decent family, and had a stable career to boot. Ladies often got deceived by such frauds. Beneath his premediated gestures of chivalry, he was a cold machine. Everything he did was for family inheritance.</p><br/><p>Thrusting himself into a woman\u2019s body gave him no pleasure. Only two words would ring in his head \u2013 \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d The smile on his face was not for himself, but to meet the expectations of others.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, such men were truly uncommon. It was a sad, sad existence. He shared more resemblances with a machine than a living being.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, if he keeps these thoughts to himself, he would be the ideal gentleman. He had the mannerisms and demeanor of the ideal husband.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

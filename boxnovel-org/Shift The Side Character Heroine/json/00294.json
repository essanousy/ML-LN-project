He would not fail to subscribe any of Rosemary\u2019s novels.</p><br/><p>Now that \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d had been successfully adapted in anime form and was being broadcasted on Bilibili, he had unhesitatingly spent 10 RMB to enjoy the privilege of having early access to the episodes. He loved this Esport novel that much.</p><br/><p>Of course, Han Leng did not know that Zhao Youyue was actually the mysterious VA for Xiao Yu. It had left him very concerned over Yu Shengfan\u2019s VA\u2019s performance. Although he was not a crazy fan, he was afraid that the overall quality of the entire anime would be ruined, due to the VA\u2019s inexperience.</p><br/><p>There were far too many rumors about Yu Shengfan\u2019s VA, causing panic among the masses. Even though Song Gang had jumped up to help the VA, the public believed him to be acting at the behest of the company. He had practically been paid to lie with his eyes open. He could have boasted about anything else, yet he had chosen to boast about the voice acting capabilities of the newbie VA. How would those words quench the fire?</p><br/><p>The greater the boast, the more false hope it gives, and the greater the disappointment.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was pleased with the first few episodes of \u201cThe Strongest King.\u201d He felt that the established Tian Yi animation company had put much effort into the production. It was a work of caliber, and the VAs had carried out their lines diligently. As long as they could maintain such conditions, this anime might not necessarily satisfy all the fans of the original novel, but would certainly deserve to be referred as an excellent example of Industry Conscience.</p><br/><p>However, the better the contents in the early stage, the more worried Han Leng grew about the mysterious VA who would be voice acting for Yu Shengfan. His instincts told him that she would be the Achilles\u2019 Heel of the entire production!</p><br/><p>If that really is the case, all those exaggerated rumors might actually come true. Everything, from the great start to the decent Vas, would be undone. After all, Han Leng understood all too well how crazy those Xiao Yu fans can get!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, Lady Zhao was definitely a veteran Xiao Yu fan. She must be very uneasy by now\u2026\u201d Han Leng thought.</p><br/><p>He could never forget how hurt and lost Lady Zhao became, when Rosemary wrote Xiao Yu to death.</p><br/><p>This gave way to feelings of envy towards Rosemary, as when he wrote Chu Luoxun to death, Lady Zhao barely batted an eyelid. This made him consider his Goddess Chu to be inferior to Xiao Yu.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun was too perfect, to an unrealistic extent. Of course, there would be some form of dissonance when one reads about her.</p><br/><p>As for Xiao Yu, her \u2018monarch with the strongest mouth\u2019 quirk was rather interesting. Many readers who lacked quick wits and sharp tongue would like Xiao Yu very much, as she would be able to take their place and take a stand against the injustice in their lives, firing back at all who are slighting them.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was chatting with one of his fans at that moment. This fan went by the alias, \u2018Jian Bing.\u2019 He became a fan after reading his book \u201cConquering the World in an Online Game.\u201d The fan was rather loyal, to the point of even sending presents on Han Leng\u2019s birthday. These presents usually came in the form of taste treats, suiting his alias.</p><br/><p>Han Leng treated such loyal fans with relish. Although he had withdrawn from the web novel world and had entered the world of youth novels, he shouldn\u2019t forget his old loyal fans, should he?</p><br/><p>Han Leng was nothing like Su Li, who only recognized her tycoon fans. When he gets along with a reader, he would judge them as equals. If he finds the reader nice, and if the reader\u2019s comments scratch his itchy bits, he would certainly include them into his inner circle.</p><br/><p>\u2018Jian Bing\u2019 was such a reader. He was coincidentally a book fan of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d as well. Thus, the subject of their chat would revolve around the new anime, \u201cThe Strongest King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suppose that the new episode of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d will be broadcasted tonight? It seems that it\u2019s finally Xiao Yu\u2019s turn to appear. I am feeling so nervous. I\u2019m still afraid that the mysterious newbie VA will ruin the character,\u201d typed \u2018Jian Bing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Han Leng read the message and replied, \u201cThank God I am not a crazy Xiao Yu fan. I don\u2019t have high expectations of this VA. As long as she doesn\u2019t ruin the character too much, I would be fine with that. I think the other VAs are doing okay. They did well in the first few episodes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried that a rat would shit into the entire porridge pot! Song Gang, the VA for the male protagonist Lin Feng, is a publicly recognized VA. He has the skills to back his popularity. He\u2019s one of the few out there who treats his work with a passion. If his partner is a VA who had been snuck in through the \u2018backdoor,\u2019 just because she let somebody use her \u2018backdoor,\u2019 this would definitely affect their overall performance. After all, Xiao Yu would practically be the main character over the next arc or so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can only believe in the Tian Yi animation company. Their projects have always been well-received,\u201d Han Leng comforted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrack record aside, they really deviated from the norm, even by their standards! They were so secretive this time. Something fishy is going on behind the scenes! I\u2019d say, Ding Hui should have been the VA. She is a true veteran. Besides, her voice would be more suitable for the role\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the anxious \u2018Jian Bing,\u2019 Han Leng smiled helplessly. He could only comfort him once more. Then, he sent a message to Zhao Youyue, \u201cMy lady, are you feeling nervous right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue received the message, and was confused. She asked, \u201cWhat do you mean, nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill putting up a strong front? Xiao Yu is going to appear in the anime adaptation of\u201dThe Strongest King\u201d soon. Nobody has faith in this new VA. As a Xiao Yu fan, don\u2019t you feel nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m a picture of calm. Just wait and see. The \u2018Yu Shengfan Disease\u2019 will spread like wildfire after this, as more fans beg for Xiao Yu to insult them,\u201d Zhao Youyue replied.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was at a loss of words. Where did this Lady Zhao\u2019s inexplicable self-confidence come from?</p><br/><p>Is it because that she already knows who the mysterious VA is?</p><br/><p>Oh, right. Whatever it is, after tonight\u2019s broadcast, the VA\u2019s name would come up in the credits. All will be known.</p><br/><p>Finally, the new episode came online. Han Leng watched it right away. There, Yu Shengfan appeared. Even though he was not a crazy Xiao Yu fan, he could feel his eyes lighting up. This golden-haired twintail loli lady had been drawn rather well. She had the aura and gait befitting of a tycoon lady!</p><br/><p>All that\u2019s left now was her voice</p><br/><p>When Yu Shengfan spoke, he was stunned. The VA was nothing like the rumors. It sounded like the perfect reproduction of Yu Shengfan\u2019s voice!</p><br/><p>Han Leng was totally fascinated by the episode. At the same time, all the doubts within his heart vanished completely. This mysterious, newbie VA deserved the role!</p><br/><p>He was relieved. Only one question rose in his heart: why did this Yu Shengfan\u2019s voice sound slightly familiar?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

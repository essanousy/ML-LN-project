The scene within the walls blew her away.</p><br/><p>No other city, no matter how grand, would be as tidy and orderly as Kaer Morhen was. Look at the commercialized public transportation in the town. It was so developed, so convenient.</p><br/><p>When Olivia was creating this city, she had drawn most of her inspiration from modern cities. She had even made sufficient preparation for future expansions. This included the residential area, business district, industrial area. Such a precisely designed city left the other cities of its time in the dust.</p><br/><p>Olivia was not just playing a virtual reality \u201cCivilization\u201d game. She was also playing \u201cSim City\u201d at the same time. Most incredibly was how she was always able to completely realize her vision, no matter fantastical her dreams were. The citizens of the world would never have their guard up, even if they were assured of having adapted to her mindblowing standards.</p><br/><p>The bloodline power which only existed within this magical source world had been utilized by Olivia to its fullest. As she continued studying the fundamental mysteries of magic, she used what she learned to create new technologies. As for the completion of the various quests released by the system the witchers from the School of the Wolf within Kaer Morhen and many other registered mercenary groups took care of them.</p><br/><p>This was how Olivia\u2019s mind worked. She was continually reforming the world according to her own will, no matter how eccentric and outlandish some of her \u2018new\u2019 ideas were.</p><br/><p>Yennefer\u2019s heart had initially been filled with arrogance. She was here to come and teach Geralt\u2019s adopted daughters some magic. Yet, she had been blown away by the sights within \u201cThe City of Miracles.\u201d Only one with a broad and profound understanding of magic and had already reached an unfathomable extent in other realms could imagine such a city.</p><br/><p>Several magical prisms had already picked up on Yennefer as she walked about. That\u2019s right. Surveillance cameras riddled the city, which almost left no room for criminals and spies to hide\u2026</p><br/><p>What about human rights? Olivia was doing a great job as a leader. As the supreme ruler, it was her right to expand her power over every nook and cranny and claim complete control of everything. It would be unbecoming of her to possess blindspots of any sort.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Olivia raised Kaer Morhen\u2019s own army, using magical dark technology to produce a suitable management system for it. Suffice to say, she also set the mages upon such a path, producing smaller-scaled, similar systems for other organizations.</p><br/><p>She spearheaded progress, driven by the pursuit of knowledge, inspiring others to do the same. When technology reaches a certain level, no trouble could be caused, no matter how many attempted to rebel. Supreme technology ruled over all else.</p><br/><p>Olivia did not expect much from Yennefer\u2019s visit. Things have changed. Her forces were already developing as scheduled. People may view her as the princess of a fallen kingdom and a great merchant, but she was already on equal footing as a female emperor.</p><br/><p>No other ruler would have been able to carry out dictatorship like she did. A modern person might have been terrified at the thought of such leadership, but she was like a divine guiding light to the masses. She was the \u201cemperor\u201d of this world.</p><br/><p>One of the most enjoyable aspects of \u201cCivilization\u201d games was how one could produce tanks, aircraft and other war machines ahead of other forces. Others might still be swinging cold steel about. Thus, things could end up rather satisfying to watch. Hahahah, did you just try firing arrows at my metal aircraft\u2026</p><br/><p>Olivia had turned her focus to farming, maintaining her guise as a neutral force. She was nothing but a force of neutrality. Be it the Northern realm or the Southern Nilfgaardian Empire, she intended to crush them with technology and scientific magic. It was only a matter of time.</p><br/><p>She also found that the Northern realm and the Southern Nilfgaardian Empire seemed to be on exceedingly good terms with her. Perhaps it had something to do with how she had also accepted many commissions and completed many sideline quests as she discovered new maps?</p><br/><p>It was simple. Olivia\u2019s identity as a little princess of the Kingdom of Cintra projected itself, loud and clear. The Kingdom of Cintra had etched itself on the pages of history for tenaciously holding back the Nilfgaardian Empire\u2019s attack for the sake of the Northern kingdoms. Unquestionably, the Northern kingdoms respected this Princess of Cintra. She was now revered as the leading figure of the neutral Kaer Morhen.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Nilfgaardian Empire\u2019s ambiguity and favorability towards Olivia could not be determined as easily. Some even said that Emperor Emhyr was fond of the \u201cNorthland Pearl.\u201d They would never imagine that Olivia was actually Emperor Emhyr\u2019s actual daughter\u2026</p><br/><p>The great emperor was having quite the headache about this issue concerning his inheritance. Without long-term consideration, there would be short-term troubles. After Emperor Emhyr realized that he might no longer be fertile, he gradually favored the younger Olivia. She deserved to rule over his empire. He hoped to be able to unite the entire continent in his lifetime. After that, he would pass down the throne to his worthy successor, and his life would be complete.</p><br/><p>The great emperor practically turned a blind eye to Olivia\u2019s chamber of commerce, allowing it to do whatever she wanted within the empire\u2019s borders. Even the merchants of the empire could not help but wonder about the relationship between Princess Olivia and the great emperor\u2026</p><br/><p>Olivia had grown very experienced at having many fathers. On the other hand, Lady Zhao wielded her privilege like a well-honed blade. She used it all to her advantage and added it on to her strengths. She even received news that the Northern realm might even be fighting the Nilfgaardian Empire very soon. This meant another great wave of business opportunity. More talented individuals displaced by war would turn up at Kaer Morhen\u2019s doorstep.</p><br/><p>Olivia already considered Yennefer as another unnecessary high-class sorceress, but she knew better than to offend her. She gave Yennefer due respect. Perhaps Yennefer was going to be her stepmother?</p><br/><p>Therefore, the moment Yennefer entered the city, a servant was dispatched to escort her. He acted as a tour guide, introducing her to various key structures before finally bringing her to the ancient castle of Kaer Morhen that she was very familiar with\u2026</p><br/><p>When Yennefer saw the ancient castle, she felt inexplicably relieved. Finally, a familiar sight. It fitted the sword and magical world that she had grown up in. But when she stepped into the ancient castle, she was astounded all over again!</p></div>\n</div>"}

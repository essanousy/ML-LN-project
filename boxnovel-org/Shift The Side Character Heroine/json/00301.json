{"title": "Chapter 301", "id": 301, "volume": 4, "url": "http://boxnovel.org/shift-the-side-character-heroine-chapter-301", "volume_title": "Volume 4", "body": "<h1>Chapter 301</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p><strong>Analyze and Interpret</strong></p><br/><p>Sacrificing the \u201chigh popularity character card\u201d would not be as simple as casually selecting any world one wants to enter into. Essentially, the chosen world must be of the same energy level as the world the high popularity character card originated from.</p><br/><p>This brings to question of what energy level did \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d actually have?</p><br/><p>On the surface, it looked like a slice-of-life world, but if you take a closer look, you will spot the abnormalities. Whether it\u2019s the magical physical strength of the mini 4WD car racers, or the \u201cdeadly moves\u201d of the cars themselves, such things do not occur in reality.</p><br/><p>Therefore, generally speaking, such worlds that appear to be perfectly normal as a whole, while actually possessing a mysterious side, should be on equal standing as those \u201cblood sports\u201d driven worlds.</p><br/><p>There are such works in this world, such as \u201cCaptain Tsubasa,\u201d \u201cThe Prince of Tennis\u201d and so on, but both of these have been completely released. In the former, the male protagonist, \u201cTsubasa Ozora\u201d[1] was unquestionably an iconic character, and the female protagonist in the story would not trail too far behind in terms of popularity. Unfortunately, no one would remember her name. She would only be identified as the captain of the cheerleading team. In fact, everyone would only remember her as the \u2018golden partner'[2] of \u201cTsubasa Ozora.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsubasa Ozora\u201d and his \u2018golden partner\u2019 has a special move where they would kick the ball together towards the goal, at the same time. Such an overpowering force would be impossible, for even the best goalkeepers to handle. In reality, can this move really be pulled off?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Prince of Tennis\u201d is another iconic piece. Unfortunately, almost all the well-known characters were male, so it became a favorite of many fujoshi readers. As it neared its finale, the work started picking up another name \u2013 \u201cBlood Tennis\u201d[3]. How strange\u2026</p><br/><p>Since iconic works like \u201cCaptain Tsubasa\u201d and \u201cThe Prince of Tennis\u201d already existed, other \u201cblood sports\u201d stories would be inevitably overshadowed. Of course, Stephen Chow\u2019s \u201cShaolin Soccer\u201d stood in another class of its own. It was a prime example of \u201cblood sports.\u201d In \u201cShaolin Soccer,\u201d all the characters would kick the soccer ball as if they were engaged in lethal martial arts combat. In the final match, a goalkeeper was almost literally pummeled to death by soccer balls that were sent flying in his direction. Only when a goalkeeper with Tai Chi[4] skills, played by Zhao Wei[5] appeared, the situation was reversed.</p><br/><p>It is said that \u201cShaolin Soccer\u201d became quite a hit at the Japan box office. Japan really loves their \u201cBlood Sports.\u201d</p><br/><p>This world also has a \u201cShaolin Soccer\u201d movie, but it was released many years ago.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether it is \u201cCaptain Tsubasa,\u201d\u201dThe Prince of Tennis,\u201d or \u201cShaolin Soccer,\u201d they have all been completed, so there is no chance of entering those worlds. If Zhao Youyue wants to, she could enter the various forms of doujins derived from those titles, but how many iconic characters would actually emerge out of a Doujin?</p><br/><p>In short, worlds that revolve around sports and tournaments are usually dominated by male characters. The female characters in these worlds would remain as side characters. Even if there is a romance in the plot, it would not necessarily be a man and a woman falling in love. The love and relationship between two men might be comparably more entertaining and popular than one between a man and a woman.</p><br/><p>Recently, there\u2019s a \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d that is enjoying a fair bit of popularity. However, it was also nearing completion, and there was not much room for manipulation.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the environment in \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d is ill-suited for the creation of an iconic female character. In addition to that, Zhao Youyue could not see any ability worth taking from that world.</p><br/><p>She did not want to enter worlds that revolved around combat and sports. What could she do with those mysterious deadly moves, even if she gets them?</p><br/><p>Other than the \u201cblood sports\u201d category, \u201cThe 4WD God\u201d would also be similar to another category of worlds, which was the world of \u201clight-emitting cuisines.\u201d Works under this category include those like \u201cChuka Ichiban\u201d and \u201cShokugeki no Soma.\u201d The former was already complete, while the latter had no characters of unique talents. Zhao Youyue started feeling helpless\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue believed that Su Li would be the ideal illustrator for \u201cShokugeki no Soma.\u201d This work was catered for people who enjoyed immersing themselves in the beauty and taste of each delicacy, and it was well aware of its purpose. Having a clear direction meant that it did its job particularly well. It excelled in the parts where characters would look extremely satisfied after eating the magical, aphrodisiac dishes. Maybe she can be the pioneer of food comics.</p><br/><p>Purely from a trendsetter\u2019s point of view, \u201cShokugeki no Soma\u201d could be considered innovative. In this world, the character Miss Erina Nakiri has the \u201cGod\u2019s Tongue.\u201d She could be considered a character that Zhao Youyue could use to her advantage. Due to the popularity of \u201cShokugeki no Soma,\u201d Zhao Youyue would get a headstart, if she possesses this character, so it would not be difficult to create an iconic character.</p><br/><p>However, in this world, \u201cShokugeki no Soma\u201d had been going on for several years!</p><br/><p>Well, it could not be helped. A manga as popular as this would be on the same note as webnovels. The longer a series gets, the more popular it gets. Then, the storyline would be milked to its limits, without a conclusive end. Milking here might not be an accurate term, as the plot is really that long\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue deeply despised the fact that she neither had a talent for creating works nor did she have an eidetic memory. If she could wholly recall the entire plot of \u201cShokugeki no Soma,\u201d she would work together with Su Li and replicate it.</p><br/><p>Wait, if things are this way, wouldn\u2019t this mean that the creator of this manga would be her?</p><br/><p>If so, can she enter her own work and cause trouble?</p><br/><p>She suddenly felt like trying it out!</p><br/><p>After all, when she causes trouble, the changes and fresh information from her efforts would not be transferred to the creator in real-time. The creator\u2019s \u201cinspiration\u201d mode is not concurrent to her every action in those worlds. In fact, the creator would only receive the information after she is done making trouble. Only when fed a constant stream of that information, would he or she enter an \u201cintoxicated\u201d state.</p><br/><p>What would happen if she is both the creator and a character in her own work?</p><br/><p>This made Zhao Youyue extremely curious, but the crux of the problem remained. She simply did not have the talent to create works of her own\u2026</p><br/><p>However, she had the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d</p><br/><p>This would be something worth experimenting with in the future.</p><br/><p>Considering how difficult it is to make an iconic character, Zhao Youyue earning 3 of them in such a short period of time was quite an achievement. She had been incredibly lucky, yet she was still constantly complaining about how the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d was messing with her. Clearly, this illustrated how greedy she is.</p><br/><p>If she were to make an iconic character without going through the cheap use of a tragedy, the process would take considerably longer. Zhao Youyue did not find such a method cost-effective. Deep down, she would willingly direct the life of a female character to a tragic end, so tragic that it would herald the coming of a comet.</p><br/><p>This is typical gambling psychology.</p><br/><p>Even so, with so many ill-fated characters resting in pieces, she would have to be ingenious in her next attempt. Otherwise, the new character would also experience the same, boring fate of being fatally ill and end up dead before realizing the peak of their dreams, just like Yu Shengfan and Chu Luoxun. If the new character dies the same way again, the readers would stare at the outcome blankly, and might even start laughing morbidly\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh, another terminal disease.</p><br/><p>Oh, another death.</p><br/><p>Oh, another of Su Li\u2019s characters.</p><br/><p>Why get sad over these ill-fated characters, it is quite the entertainment.</p><br/><p>When an ill-fated character can only do so much as to draw a chuckle or two, what is so iconic about it?</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] In \u201cCaptain Tsubasa,\u201d the main character is Tsubasa Oozora. The name literally translates to \u201cExtensive Sky Wings.\u201d You can guess how it would sound like when literally translated in Chinese, so we opted for his original Japanese name.</p><br/><p>[2] In \u201cCaptain Tsubasa,\u201d Tsubasa\u2019s golden partner is Taro Misaki. Together, they form the \u201cGolden Combi.\u201d</p><br/><p>[3] In \u201cThe Prince of Tennis,\u201d many of the characters have special techniques that they can use while playing tennis. The anime is also known as \u201cBlood Tennis\u201d because these special techniques sometimes hurt or injure the user\u2019s opponents severely.</p><br/><p>[4] \u201cTai Chi\u201d is an internal (soft) Chinese martial art practiced for both its defense training and its health benefits. The term \u201cTai Chi\u201d refers to a philosophy of the forces of yin and yang, related to the moves.</p><br/><p>[5] \u201cZhao Wei\u201d is a female actress in China.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

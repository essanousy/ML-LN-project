Even though most of the people in the group agreed to meet up for lunch, except Zhao Youyue, only five of them showed up in the end. They had all sorts of excuses such as urgent matters coming up, or parents coming to visit them.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue included, that made six people, three guys, and three girls.</p><br/><p>The three guys included Wang Zongchao and Guo Peisheng, and a certain Cao Yuan. He was big and tall. Apparently, he played basketball pretty well, and could still maintain his good grades, which were among the top twenty.</p><br/><p>The other two girls were Xu Na, and Shen Menglian, both of their names sounded awfully familiar because they were always in the top ten positions, and both of them always had first place in their respective classes.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue treated this as a typical student gathering, and sincerely sought to get to know more about these students who regularly pass their exams with flying colors; what could she possibly lose. This would easily satisfy her tiny little ego.</p><br/><p>As always, Zhao Youyue wore her plain and simple uniform for the gathering, and they agreed to meet up at an old pavilion in school.</p><br/><p>She ended up feeling awkward, being the odd one out, as everyone came in flashy casual \u2013 the school rules never required them to wear their uniforms on weekends.</p><br/><p>The other two girls had dolled themselves up. Unfortunately, they were still no match for Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>The probability of a beautiful girl being a top student this year was not unheard of, but it would be difficult for them to be among the top ten students of the school.</p><br/><p>Any student with a good grades would understand how hard it is to get into the top ten in the whole school in a state of consistency.</p><br/><p>In this school, these top ten students had the potential to ace the final exams in their third-year, which meant that they could pick whichever university they wanted such as, Tokyo Metropolitan University and Chung Hua University, the top recommendations of China\u2019s government.</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao was wearing his casual clothing as well; he had not dressed-up for the appointment, he simply switched out of his uniform. He was not a big guy, he had average looks, but he always had this smile on his face, an inscrutable beam that exuded confidence. This confidence was particularly familiar to Zhao Youyue, because she had seen it before from \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he had the strength, he could confidently flaunt it.</p><br/><p>When Wang Zongchao met Zhao Youyue, he was surprised, for beyond his expectations, Zhao Youyue had turned out to be this fair, delicate, cute girl with a short bobcut.</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao greeted Zhao Youyue with enthusiasm, and he introduced his members to Zhao Youyue with ease. As expected of the vice president of the student council. His social skills weren\u2019t that bad. Zhao Youyue could not tell what sort of person he was from the group chat alone, but in the flesh, she could tell that he was rather amicable.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Zhao Youyue was not much of an introvert; she gladly introduced herself to these top students. Her sincere smile and soothing voice gave her a mysterious charm that made her easily approachable.</p><br/><p>This left Wang Zongchao astonished. When he heard that Zhao Youyue loved to play games, he had assumed that she would look like an introverted otaku who kept to herself more than anything. He was indeed surprised to find out that Zhao Youyue had turned out to be a girl that was easy to hang around with; she would easily become friends with anybody.</p><br/><p>Usually, a girl with an unpredictable attitude would not have good grades, because they would not spend too much attention on their studies, but Zhao Youyue was different. Clearly, she was a genius! It was a mystery as to why she had not gained fame any sooner.</p><br/><p>The other two guys treated Zhao Youyue with enthusiasm. She had a pretty face, a cute face was always nicer to talk to.</p><br/><p>The two girls who were called Xu Na and Shen Menglian just smiled at Zhao Youyue. When they saw Zhao Youyue in her school uniform, they chuckled within their hearts. As the rumors have said, Zhao Youyue did not hail from a particularly well-off family.</p><br/><p>It could not be helped, both of their results were not on the same level as Zhao Youyue, and they were not as pretty as Zhao Youyue, even with all that pasty make-up. So, if looking at her clothing and the state of her family gives them some refuge for self-satisfaction, it would be better than drowning in envy\u2026</p><br/><p>The six of them went to the shopping district in separate cars. The atmosphere of the girl\u2019s cab was very dull; Zhao Youyue even had to pay for the cab fare. The two girls thought she was just trying to show off; they believed that Zhao Youyue would feel heartache for the money she spent.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the other cab\u2019s atmosphere was quite lively. Cao Yuan, was not just a big guy, he had a big voice to match, \u201cI never expect Zhao Youyue to be this pretty, at least not in our school, it looks like our school has crouching tigers and hidden dragons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Peisheng nudged his spectacles up the bridge of his nose and said calmly, \u201cIndeed. Her temperament and attitude are far better than the other two girls, don\u2019t you think so, brother Chao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao is usually be seen without his spectacles, because his eyesight wasn\u2019t that bad, but he had to wear it during classes. \u201cOf course, I also feel that she is suitable for our student council, her overall ability should be impressive. Unlike those girls who only know how to study, she is a talented person! It shows!\u201d He praised with his usual smile.</p><br/><p>Cao Yuan and Guo Peisheng were surprised by Wang Congzhao\u2019s review of Zhao Youyue; she cannot be taken lightly. Wang Zongchao never really spared the other two girls a glance, even though both of them boasted decent results, but they did not possess any charm or elegance.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, let me test her to see if she\u2019s really good at multiple languages later\u2026\u201d Wang Zongchao said it in a joking manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Chao is not just good at English; he even knows French! Brother Chao is simply marvelous!\u201d Guo Peisheng initiated the boot-licking session.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, your piano level is at grade ten too, right? You always perform at the final program for our campus parties!\u201d Cao Yuan quickly followed up.</p><br/><p>Wang Zongchao had already gotten used to flattering, \u201cLately, the girls only pay attention to handsome faces, my side-character face wouldn\u2019t stand a chance, hahaha,\u201d he said flippantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too humble, Brother Chao. You just never accepted those who confessed to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess that brother Chao wouldn\u2019t be interested in Zhao Youyue, either!\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, Wang Zongchao did not have any interest in Zhao Youyue, even though she was cute, but she was far from stunning him with her looks. He had always looked down on mortals, as if he was lounging on the top of the clouds.</p>\n</div>"}

The goddess of misfortune.</p><br/><p>If her artworks did not suffer misfortune, their creators would.</p><br/><p>Of course, Wu Shun started off as a skeptic. He thought that it was all baloney, but after much investigation and interviewing Su Li\u2019s fans, he could not deny that everytime Su Li did something, adverse events occurred, supporting the misconception that Su Li\u2019s power was real.</p><br/><p>Wu Shun\u2019s gut feeling assured that those rumors were all unfounded. He did play along, firing shots at Su Li\u2019s fans during livestreams by saying \u201cIf this Su Li is really that illustrator Su Li, she did a great job. That nameless maiden \u2013 Yan Qingmeng \u2013 Li Keyi trio all went through an awful lot. Nameless Swordswoman basically dies in every possible route, even if she\u2019s the main character.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Shun was not convinced that this was the same Su Li as the mangaka. Mangakas don\u2019t suddenly transition into 3D rendering for video games.</p><br/><p>More than a few viewers also had such thoughts, but the slim possibility nagged at their thoughts. Wherever Su Li went, trouble followed.</p><br/><p>A Su Li fan stood up for her, saying that she already had her hands full with, \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d and \u201cHimegoto.\u201d She could not possibly have the time to design more characters for \u201cTales of Wuxia 3\u201d. He deduced that it was an uncanny coincidence, nothing else. People needed to lay off her \u2013 it was all Old Thief Zha Feng\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>Su Li would always feel bad for her fans \u2013 they would always try to protect her from verbal harm \u2013 just like how Zhao Youyue usually did. It was not easy being Su Li</p><br/><p>Her loyal fans would always get blasted in the face by unpleasant truths.</p><br/><p>This incident was no different. After Wu Shun\u2019s lifestream, one of the viewers asked Su Li if she was in charge of \u201cTales of Wuxia 3\u2019s\u201d character design.</p><br/><p>Being the primary illustrator for this DLC, she had indeed played a huge role in its production. Because it was FengHuo Gaming Company, the pay was luxurious, and she had the added bonus of being in close proximity with Lady Zhao who clearly loved the game. All these factors were more than enough for her to take the job seriously.</p><br/><p>Although Su Li already knew the extent of the nameless maiden\u2019s tragic ending, she had a clear conscience, being its creator. When it came to Xu Jing, she had no qualms creating the worst case scenario for her, a fate that went beyond the realm of human rationale. You could say she did it to get readers hyped up.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why the dreaded fate of the nameless maiden had been so sorry, so touching. Still, what could be done about it? She was a virtual character. She existed only to provide entertainment for the players.</p><br/><p>In that vein, Su Li had created many abusive outlines for her illustrations to hype up players, enhanced by the usage of CGs such as the nameless maiden\u2019s CG illustration. Su Li had been on board this train the entire time</p><br/><p>The only thing Su Li did not see coming was to have fans asking her about this so soon. Someone might have already beaten the game, or they had a wild guess based on the art style.</p><br/><p>As Su Li only follow Lady Zhao\u2019 stream, she would remain unaware of someone like \u201cThe King of Grinding\u201d \u2013 Wu Shun, a creature who flung all of his free time into the game. When you only stop to sleep, you would surely overtake Zhao Youyue\u2019s progress.</p><br/><p>Su Li maintained her upright personality and admitted on Weibo that she had played a part in \u201cTales of Wuxia 3\u201d DLC\u2019s production. She proceeded to post the character arts and design, even advertising the game\u2019s illustration book as merchandise. As long as they sold well, she would receive her ample, fair share.</p><br/><p>The money-grubbing Su Li would bar no holds when it came to promoting anything that would increase her profit. The game had made shockwaves across the market. The DLC even more so. This was a great time to ride on its waves.</p><br/><p>So what if more of those \u201cthe poisonous Su Li strikes again\u201d or \u201cGoddess Su is at it again!\u201d headlines made their way to the top of search engines. More attention on her, good or bad, it didn\u2019t matter. If people wanted to paint her as a portrait of the devil, so be it. She would go with the flow, she would capitalize on it and reap more profit.</p><br/><p>As expected, when Su Li revealed that she was in fact in charge of the DLC art for \u201cTales of Wuxia 3\u201d, even going so far as to release original character illustrations promote the game\u2019s illustration books, her Weibo blew up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder Ms. Nameless had such a terrible fate! It was all due to Goddess Su\u2019s curse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the illustration looked familiar, but I could not quite put my finger in it. 3D is vastly different from 2D, afterall. Curse you, Goddess Su!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddess Su is truly unstoppable First the manga world, then the LN [1] world, and now the gaming world?! She was definitely done in by Zha Feng! I thought that old thief Zha Feng would get slammed for this, but Goddess Su is here yet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat \u2018Tales of Wuxia 3: Swords of the Future\u2019? It\u2019s \u2018Tales of Wuxia 3: Upbringing of Misfortune\u2019! I pity Goddess Su She must have got done in by Zha Feng! Now, all the old thieves are pouncing on the Goddess, since all they want to do is torture and lift death flags for the character, with Su Li there to act as their meatshields, what was there left to worry about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Thief Zha Feng got a good eye. This DLC just turned his series into absolute gold. Sales and ratings have hit a record high. One does not need to guess how much Goddess Su contributed to it\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this game in the past, yet when I heard that Goddess Su participated in the creation in the illustration group, I got a copy of the game straight away! No mistake about that, I am a loyal fan of Goddess Su! Follow me as we lead the fan community to the direction of revering Goddess Su!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translation note:[1] LN is Light Novels in short.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He enjoyed making a show of himself before everyone else, so he had booked the entire restaurant.</p><br/><p>This restaurant was not particularly luxurious, as Zhao Hao knew that Zhao Youyue was highly particular with her food. She prioritized food quality over everything else.</p><br/><p>The Michelin had their stars. The Michelin\u2019s Chinese counterpart would be Su, and they too awarded stars, up to 5 of them. Su had been created by the descendants of Su Dongpo; it was a system specially created to grade Chinese restaurants. In eastern China, a 5-star Su\u2019s rating meant a lot, almost equaling that of a Michelin 3-star. If the restaurant had both a Michelin 3-star and a 5-star Su, it had to be really good stuff.</p><br/><p>This Chinese restaurant was awarded a 4-star Su, but it was already a decent restaurant. If there were too many 5-star Su restaurants around, then the five stars would lose their value.</p><br/><p>This restaurant was in a rural area. No paparazzi would be caught dead in this area. Zhao Hao already knew that his little cousin, Zhao Youyue was at the peak of her popularity, ever since she revealed her face. Her pure and perfect image, her intelligent wit and dry humor had already buried themselves in the hearts of many. If paparazzi ever took photos of him being together with Zhao Youyue, that would mean trouble.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao knew of his position and limitation. He used to brag about his wealth, not even batting an eyelid when the internet spread news about him crashing a million-dollar supercar, or about his interactions with Ding Yuncong or the funding his own E-sports team. All these had caused headlines back in the day.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of most netizens, he was just another filthy rich braggart, living his life to its fullest. If he somehow got involved with his little cousin, it would affect her reputation; this was something he would prefer to avoid. It would be better if Zhao Youyue could retain her flawless reputation.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Zhao Hao was envious of Ding Yuncong. He too bragged about his wealth and lived wild and free. Unexpectedly, he had a decent reputation, as a rich 2G with a shameless attitude\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao could only comfort himself by saying Ding Yuncong had average looks. Zhao Hao was too handsome compared to him. The genetics of the Zhao family were too outstanding, he believed that his little cousin, Youyue would be able to impress the audience as well!</p><br/><p>This time, Zhao Hao had invited his buddy, Ding Yuncong. Ding Yuncong would definitely bring along his star actor friend, Zhang Hongyu. The latter was an actor with a decent reputation. His acting skills were not bad, and he had acted in several movies. His career was experiencing another rise at that moment, thanks to Ding Yuncong, of course.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao\u2019s second-rated actress girlfriend, Tan Jing had already arrived at the restaurant, welcoming Zhao Hao and his friends.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong arrived early. Besides Zhang Hongyu, he had brought along a few internet celebrities as well, one of them being his girlfriend. As for her name, let\u2019s just call her internet celebrity A, since Ding Yuncong would swap girls after a while. It was great to be the son of the wealthiest man in China.</p><br/><p>Since Ding Yuncong had arrived early, he had nothing to do and was surfing Weibo. He found that many netizens had tagged him, asking how it felt to be slapped in the face.</p><br/><p>What is this about being slapped in the face?</p><br/><p>What a joke, who could possibly slap his face? The richest man in China ruled part of the world. China was an East Asia overlord, one of the greatest power to be reckoned with.</p><br/><p>The richest men often lived by the same few words. Set a target by earning 100 million first. That line went viral around the globe; even foreigners were praising it. Just like the person who created the largest E-commerce company, \u201cThe only thing I regret was creating Alibaba.\u201d Only they were qualified to say such words.</p><br/><p>Only Ding Yuncong could slap people. This happened to those self-proclaimed Ding associates. He would address every proclamation on Weibo. He used to be very zealous about this matter; he would slap the faces of those rich 2Gs as he revealed their scandals in the circle of entertainment. Ultimately, he earned the support of the public, and everyone was left thinking that he was actually a nice person!</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong would also invite his friends to a barbeque buffet; this only made him even more popular, he even gained the title of \u201cNation\u2019s Husband.\u201d Whenever he posted on Weibo, there would be a bunch of female fans saying that they were willing to bear his children\u2026</p><br/><p>This wrought a great deal of jealous from Zhao Hao. What made him the \u201cNation\u2019s Husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was jealous of Ding Yuncong, he was still one of his brothers in debauchery.</p><br/><p>As time passed, Ding Yuncong became more matured as he grew older, but his taste in women never changed.</p><br/><p>Soon afterward, Ding Yuncong found out the source of the slap. It was because of the live streamer, Ah Yu. Her popularity was quickly on the rise. He once berated Ah Yu for being an ugly girl, or just an average looking girl\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, as he criticized Ah Yu, he acknowledged her gaming and musical skills, so it shows that he was an optimistic and reasonable person.</p><br/><p>No matter how talented Ah Yu was in gaming or music, once she gets the \u201cugly\u201d label, it would definitely affect her career as a live streamer. The appearance of a girl was really important; she should at least be decent-looking after the application of makeup. If makeup and photoshop were not able to save her, just how ugly was she?</p><br/><p>If she did not even dare show her face, it clearly showed that makeup and photoshop could not save her!</p><br/><p>Just as expected, Ah Yu\u2019s popularity seemed to falter after Ding Yuncong criticized her. When Ah Yu\u2019s identity was revealed, and she was forced to show her face for the first time in her live stream. Her popularity had burst through the bottleneck, earning her overnight fame!</p><br/><p>Under those circumstances, fans who were misled by Ding Yuncong came looking for him; some emotional fans even scolded him for being so blind\u2026</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong could only chuckle at those comments; he began to search for Ah Yu\u2019s photos on the internet. When he saw the face of Zhao Youyue, his mind went blank. She was most certainly cute, and more importantly, her face was a natural beauty! It could not be helped, most women he played with were artificial. Of course, he would have the experience to differentiate between natural and artificial.</p><br/><p>That lady-like temperament he felt from Zhao Youyue, was somewhat familiar. He did not know where this lady came from\u2026</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong would never have thought that he would soon meet Zhao Youyue in person.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She could even feel the residual effects of \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d perfect musical sense in her, and she decided to try it out on her violin. Something was fundamentally different!</p><br/><p>In conclusion, she will gain something if she submerges herself fully into a character\u2019s role whenever she enters the gate, even if she fails to inherit that character\u2019s ability at the end.</p><br/><p>Now, she was not afraid of performing in front of an audience, after knowing how to take control on the stage like \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Before each performance, she would recite silently \u2014God of Music, please listen to my call, and all would be calm, and she would indulge herself in the music.</p><br/><p>The \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d had certainly turned her dull life into a lively one, even in her real life.</p><br/><p>Well, unlike the novel world which was full of ups and down, she will not suddenly find herself succumbing to the incurable disease in this Three Dimensional, real world.</p><br/><p>Although dog blood [1] incidents like these do happen in reality, a \u201cside character\u201d like her couldn\u2019t possibly be struck by it. It would only happen to the main character, or those close to him</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue has finally found out what abilities she had inherited after studying the two Character Cards that she gained. In fact, it felt like \u201cXu Jing\u201d and \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d were using her body to emerge in this world, or she was slowly falling into a schizophrenic state.</p><br/><p>However, this was unlike the multi-personality disorder. It was all under Zhao Youyue\u2019s control. They will only appear under her will.</p><br/><p>Obviously, she had an excellent flair for agility and coordination, etc. However, she did not have the mental quality to utilize those innate gifts fully.</p><br/><p>Her main personality was more average than the average Jane</p><br/><p>Therefore, these two Character Cards were the keys to initiating the treasure within herself, enabling her to unleash all her hidden potential!</p><br/><p>Perhaps, every average person has unlimited potential like her, and they would not know that they can push their limit to such a point, under the guidance of the cards!</p><br/><p>But, Zhao Youyue was little upset with this discovery. Even if she gains the character card of a superpowered person, she would not be able to use it in reality.</p><br/><p>It was all because she did not have the blood of that person in her veins. In other words, she can only use the superpower when she possesses the character. Otherwise, it would not happen, unless she already has the superpower gene in her.</p><br/><p>This was impossible, right?</p><br/><p>Therefore, she must first have a body which can use that particular superpower in reality</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue began to realize that it was so much harder for her to ruin the real world, than the novel world. All those robotic machines, supernatural abilities, and magic that one could imagine sounded sane in the novel word, but they were useless in this precise, materialistic realistic world.</p><br/><p>But, Zhao Youyue soon adjusted her mind. Nevertheless, it was a great thing. Even though she can only break her mental limiters with the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d it gave her power, outstanding power, nevertheless.</p><br/><p>Bear in mind that, the longer she uses the \u201cXu Jing\u2019s Card\u201d or \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s Card\u201d, the more muscle memory will be left in her body. This will make her outstanding.</p><br/><p>For instance, she can do well in her homework and examination without initiating \u201cXu Jing\u2019s Card\u201d because she had absorbed all her knowledge during the previous usages. After all, this was her body, and the mind had spent time studying.</p><br/><p>The same goes for the usage of \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s Card,\u201d she can play the game just as well, without initiating it. Her body knew what to do by itself.</p><br/><p>Not only talent, but proficiency is also crucial at playing games too. During the process of using \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s Card,\u201d she also had quickly absorbed her sharp wits and strong awareness.</p><br/><p>Someday, Zhao Youyue might reach her level without initiating \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s Card\u201d. This was not an imagination \u2013 be it Xu Jing or Yu Shengfan, they were both Zhao Youyue. So, why she can\u2019t she make their abilities hers, if they are using her body to be an entity?</p><br/><p>Apparently, initiating the character card was the way for Zhao Youyue to gain the sense of presence. But, she will become outstanding by herself someday, and those cards will be merely an adornment.</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of the character cards, she would gradually transform from a side character into the heroine.</p><br/><p>Again, Zhao Youyue understood that these cards actually served as references, and that she too can reach that level, if she is determined to do so</p><br/><p>Thus, Zhao Youyue decided to use the cards only when necessary. She wanted to train herself to be like the characters of the cards.</p><br/><p>Hence, she did not use \u201cXu Jing\u2019s Card\u201d in the class, as usual, letting herself seek for the measured concentration. Without realizing, she managed to listen to a class earnestly!</p><br/><p>Unsure if it was her imagination, she felt as though the knowledge gained through her own effort, was far more than that which was acquired via the \u201cXu Jing\u2019s Card\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, without going through the veil of the card, she was directly receiving the teachings of her teacher.</p><br/><p>Some might ask, what is her purpose for not relying on the character card? What is the point?</p><br/><p>It meant everything! When she fully masters Xu Jing\u2019s ability to focus and obsession in studying, then the card can be sacrificed</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue would be reluctant to sacrifice \u201cXu Jing\u2019s Card\u201d by looking at the style of \u201cComplete Collector\u201d and \u201cCard Collector Maniac\u201d which she learned of gradually.</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] Dog blood () is used to refer something nonsense, exaggerated or illogic.</p>\n</div>"}

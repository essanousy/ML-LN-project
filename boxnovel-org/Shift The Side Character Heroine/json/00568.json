She could almost feel lady luck patting her on the shoulder, yet \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d had fooled her once again. Of all the millions of titles out there, why did it have to make such a choice?</p><br/><p>With such a lengthy title, this had to be a light novel on the physical market.</p><br/><p>Like online articles, several good light novels had been adapted as manga and anime. More often than not, the light novel fans would approve of the adaptations. They would be utterly convinced that this was how the author had envisioned it. Of course, this was the artist\u2019s interpretation, not the author\u2019s.</p><br/><p>In general, light novels often came attached with illustrations. Those little teasers had the wonderful effect of boosting its sales. Some people even joked that the novels were actually freebies attached to the actual product \u2013 the illustrations.</p><br/><p>Of course, not all light novels had the fortune of being accompanied by excellent illustrations. Some artists would misinterpret the author\u2019s sentences, ruining those light novels with twisted intentions. Not only would the readers criticize the novel \u2013 authors also often ended up laughing at themselves, thinking \u201cnever thought that I was so dark and evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not read much of light novels, because most of them were stories about girls. It was an easy, lazy tactic that boosted their novel sales. Include lively, lovely young girls, and make sure they are drawn well. Even the male protagonists would be all bright and cheery. They were always gentle and soft, they would be chivalrous when it came to just about everything.</p><br/><p>Who came up with the misconception that adorable young girls would only fall for gentle, soft guys? These homo sapiens would never last an hour in reality\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue despised such men. She loved to read about more appealing, outstanding protagonists. In all the novella worlds that she had visited in the past, she would gather the main cast together and get something meaningful done together. That was how you got a novel to be iconic.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt her heart dropping into her gut as she read the synopsis of this \u201cThe Whole World Is In A Deep Sleep Except For Myself\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>The main protagonist was a student in junior high named, Ren Xing. One day, he woke up and found everybody else in a deep sleep for reasons unknown. He was no longer bound by the law, and started doing everything he pleased.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue raised an eyebrow when she learned of how the male protagonist woke the girls from their slumber. He had to perform sexual intercourse to wake the sleeping beauties to the left and right!</p><br/><p>No wonder it was a hit among male readers. She was impressed by the author\u2019s creativity. If the male protagonist did not attempt to awaken them, they might have remained unconscious forever. In other words, he had saved them from eternal slumber.</p><br/><p>To remain awake, they had to have regular sex with the male protagonist.</p><br/><p>How ridiculous! Male protagonist now had a solid reason to sleep with any girl he wanted, claiming \u201d I did not want this, but I must keep you awake, and you must enjoy this free world!\u201d</p><br/><p>If you do not allow me to do anything to your body, you would be asleep for the rest of your life\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was certain that only a man could have written this!</p><br/><p>Why would the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d send her here? To possess some hapless, sleeping lady and get screwed by this man in her sleep? To obtain a sex slave character card so that she was lustful and proficient in love-making, even when her physical body was still a virgin?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue took a glance at the female characters available. There were so many to choose from. Of course, they were all beautiful girls that a male protagonist would be more than willing to have sex with\u2026</p><br/><p>Each time he chose to have sex with a girl, there would be a flashback of his interactions with her on a regular day. On those days, he would not even dream of getting close to them. Now, for the sake of staying awake, they had to beg him for sex!</p><br/><p>He could just sit down and ask them to help themselves!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue stepped out of \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d This was a headache, and it truly frustrated her. She could always quit this world by committing suicide, but it would still be really unpleasant for her\u2026</p><br/><p>One must be awake and fully conscious before one could take her own life. This meant that she would have to get screwed by the protagonist, in her sleep no less, before she could wake!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue hated this author \u2013 \u201cLove The Taste Of The Rice In Her House.\u201d He had to be a fat otaku who wanted nothing more than to freeload and get free food. He even had to specify that it was a girl\u2019s house!</p><br/><p>Such a long name! How lame!</p><br/><p>How should this author be referred to as, \u201cHer House,\u201d or \u201cThe Rice\u201d?</p><br/><p>Furious at her current predicament, Zhao Youyue made up her mind to tear this world off its hinges!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue returned to reality and purchased this light novel \u2013 for research purposes. They actually published this in hard copy form! Why was not the Mythical Beast of River Crab real?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Mythical Beast of River Crab! She had been so furious about possibly getting her body defiled, that she almost forgot about her influence in the publishing industry. There was more than one method of restraining a novel!</p><br/><p>Now that she had been backed into a corner, she missed the sensation where she could force any author to obey her. Despicable humans.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue wanted to dig this author out of his hole and have a word with him. Why can\u2019t he at least provide an alternative to staying awake without having anything to do with sex\u2026</p><br/><p>It might be a little bit challenging for Lady Zhao, as this \u201cWhole World Is In A Deep Sleep Except Myself\u201d already had a fierce cult following. Men who wanted nothing more than to think with their little brothers loved to NOT use their brains here!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could not just step in and blow the world up. Its author would not implement such a plot!</p><br/><p>It was decided. Zhao Youyue would meet this \u201cLove The Taste Of The Rice In Her House.\u201d He was really something special, to think of such reckless freedom\u2026</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, an author could only imagine this with his pen. It had always been the privilege of Zhao Family members to do as they pleased in reality!</p></div>\n</div>"}

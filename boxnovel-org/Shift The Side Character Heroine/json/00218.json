He seemed to be fascinated by the sensation of spying on Zhao Youyue\u2019s information using dual identities. Every time he learns more about Zhao Youyue, he would feel gratified in a way that could not be put in words.</p><br/><p>Han Leng saw that Zhao Youyue clearly was more passionate towards his \u2018Leng Zi\u2019 identity, because Leng Zi was the author of her favorite novel. As to how much preference she had towards this kind of authors, one would only need to look at Su Li and Rosemary.</p><br/><p>It was enjoyable and fulfilling. There were many a time when Han Leng almost could not resist revealing his true identity, so that his true self could also enjoy being favored by Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>But he fell into his own trap. To avoid arousing suspicion at that time, he had acted on impulse, and by using the voice changer, had ended up being treated as a female author\u2026</p><br/><p>At that time, Han Leng had not walked out of the knot in his heart yet. He was very afraid that his real reason for writing \u201cBeautiful April\u201d would be discovered. That guilty conscience plagued him for a long time.</p><br/><p>But now, Han Leng realized that the \u2018Lin Meiyue\u2019 under his writing was way different compared to the real Zhao Youyue. He found his nerves, because Lin Meiyue\u2019s prototype character was not the real Zhao Youyue, but the Zhao Youyue within his imagination. One was day, the other was night!</p><br/><p>Besides, the character that he had placed most of his focus on was goddess Chu, Chu Luoxun.</p><br/><p>The more Han Leng learned about Zhao Youyue, the more he felt that this girl had an alternative charm. It was not about her appearance, but her coolness and aloofness.</p><br/><p>Combined with Zhao Youyue\u2019s Lady identity which could be considered prominent, compared to ordinary people, made her even more enigmatic.</p><br/><p>If the others had such an identity, they would be loud, brash, and bold. How could they be as low key and as calm as Zhao Youyue?</p><br/><p>Now, Zhao Youyue was being treated as the poor elite scholar in class. The more the rumors spread, the more troublesome things would become.</p><br/><p>It was just like a piece of work. Most loyal readers read and voted silently, thinking that everything was pretty good. Only a small portion of readers who were very active, would constantly throw out demands. New and innocent authors usually would concern themselves with their opinions, but they ignored the real silent majority. They made amendments according to those opinions, and the silent majority would end up abandoning the books. It did not balance out in the end.</p><br/><p>This was actually a matter of choice. The author was not writing for one particular reader. He must be concerned about the general readership.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue knew that the silent majority within the class had sharp eyes. Let\u2019s just say that they have not yet figured out her Lady identity, even so, they would not treat her as a really poor student. Naturally, they would deal with the rumors with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to attend the boring self-study session this Saturday, hooray! (*)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, Lady Zhao, are you planning to slack off using the elite student\u2019s privilege again? It looks like the reason you study so diligently is for the purpose of being able to slack, am I right? SeeThrough.jpg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019m going to participate in the provincial violin competition finals, and I\u2019m going there to win. ()</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible! You even know how to play the violin? StillHaveSuchOperation.jpg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng pretended as if he had heard Zhao Youyue being able to play the violin for the first time. He had actually heard her perform before, which had left a deep impression.</p><br/><p>Only the sound of Chu Luoxun\u2019s violin would make Han Leng totally lose himself, although it was just an imagination within his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, have you read \u201cBeautiful April\u201d?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I have. Your Lady Zhao AMWAYed it like crazy, sending the 10th issue of Mengya to everyone in the class. I certainly want to read it and try to learn from it for my own essay writing. After all, April was your full mark essay!\u201d Han Leng replied with exultation.</p><br/><p>He finally had a piece of work that has been acknowledged by Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>The web novel \u201cConquer the World in Online Games,\u201d did not win Zhao Youyue\u2019s favor, as expected. It could not be helped, as it was a hollow piece literature with some flowery writing. It was not her style, not at all. She would never tip such a pretentious title.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had actually thought about giving a friendship tip before, since she had a lot to spare. But throughout the communication process with Han Leng, she found that Han Leng was highly prideful. Her tip which could be misinterpreted as her approval would turn Han Leng cold and stiff once again.</p><br/><p>She was a girl who would consider the emotions of others. After all, her EQ was quite high. Although she did not know why Han Leng who had suddenly disappeared was now contacting her again, she felt that maintaining good classmate relationship with talented folk such as Han Leng is a good thing.</p><br/><p>At first, she thought that Han Leng was a shallow, materialistic money grubber. But then she realized that this guy was an idealist. He worked in a completely different way, compared to Su Li!</p><br/><p>Su Li produced work for readers with all her heart and soul. Han Leng wrote for himself, with some serious Hipster-it is. Surprisingly, such authors easily attracted loyal fans, they would have to have their niche, specific tastes, but they would stick on, nevertheless.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue regarded idealists with a special kind of respect. She would not be one of those elite scholars who did nothing but burn the midnight oil on their schoolwork, would she?</p><br/><p>Han Leng\u2019s steadfastness towards his literature was admirable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe male lead, Gu Yuan\u2019s nicknames such as \u2018Human-type Metronome,\u201dPrize-winning Machine\u2019 are very cool, right? I will use his beliefs to conquer all the judges.\u201d Zhao Youyue spoke confidently.</p><br/><p>She had not expected the \u2018Xu Jing Card\u2019 to have such a wonderful function. It enabled her to accurately perform according to the music score, without any sense of personal emotion. This was how judges tended to evaluate performances.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut later on, during the development of the plot, Chu Luoxun\u2019s music was pointed out to be the real music that has life within, right? After being saved by Chu Luoxun, the male lead also gave up on his inflexible play style and started emulating her.\u201d Obviously, Han Leng disagreed with the male lead\u2019s initial music concept. He had made it clear in his writings.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Chu Luoxun\u2019s fame within the classical music industry isn\u2019t as good as Gu Yuan\u2019s, is it? What\u2019s the use of being famous among students? Besides, a competition is just a competition. The judges have clear rules, yet she insisted on taking liberties within the competition. She\u2019s brainless.\u201d Zhao Youyue criticized \u2018herself.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Are you still a loyal fan of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d? How dare you label Goddess Chu as brainless? To be honest, this is my \u2026I mean true love, favorite character! Show your sword, you heterodoxical Lin Meiyue fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng held aloft the flag of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 gang, drawing his sword on the Lin Meiyue fan before him.</p>\n</div>"}

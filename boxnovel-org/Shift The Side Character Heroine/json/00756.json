When she heard Yuan Zhengzong saying that he had not yet cleaned up the house, that it was quite a mess, she had been delighted. This was time for her to show her virtuosity. This was her opportunity to earn a wave of favorability. But here, the house was spotless!</p><br/><p>Now came the question. Who the heck ringed the professional cleaner over?</p><br/><p>A name flashed past Qiu Yuting\u2019s mind. It was a girl\u2019s name, Liu Shan. She would end up as Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s executive editor in the near future. Not only was she beautiful, she was proficient in everything when it came to house chores. She even made great dishes\u2026</p><br/><p>The light novel industry was the same as the manga industry. The executive editor was often in charge of the author\u2019s daily life. There were times when the author would barely have time to put a spoon in his own mouth. The greater the author, the more he would be able to be valued by the executive editor.</p><br/><p>By then, Yuan Zhengzong was already considered a relatively famous writer within the light novel industry. That was why Liu Shan, his executive editor was so considerate around him. Obviously, she was also deeply attracted to Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s gentleness, in the process of getting along with him.</p><br/><p>This might be Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s recessive protagonist aura. His \u201clight novel teaching material\u201d kind of gentleness as a male protagonist could make girls offer their everything to him without him asking. This also happened to be a relatively common setting within the 2D cultural entertainment kind of work.</p><br/><p>In the 3D world, such gentleness would have you end up as a spare tire. Girls who loved you unconditionally were almost non-existent. Even so, Yuan Zhengzong would find himself surrounded by many such existences.</p><br/><p>When have we last seen a 2D protagonist taking the initiative to pursue a girl?</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting considered Liu Shan to be quite a significant threat. After all, Liu Shan had provided Yuan Zhengzong quite the help. Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s future book, \u201cIf Only There Were No Younger Sisters\u201d seemed to have started as one of Liu Shan\u2019s suggestions.</p><br/><p>This unique twist of storylines could be said to be something fresh and new. It might even serve as a miraculous cure. Readers with the siscon disease might be able to completely part from their siscon disease. It had effectively decreased the possibility of walking on the \u201cRoad of Orthopedic,\u201d promoting the positive energy within society.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting was rather glad about this. Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s good-for-nothing sister was such an annoying hurdle. If only there were no younger sisters!</p><br/><p>While the sister was a minor annoyance, Liushan was a major threat. She could not help but start wondering. According to the flow of time, Liu Shan should not be becoming Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s executive editor just yet. So, why was the house so clean?</p><br/><p>While Yuan Zhengzong and Qiu Yuting stood like a pair of statues, Zhao Youyue, or rather, the possessed Yuan Shawu made her appearance. Something was very different about her!</p><br/><p>Obviously, she barely existed. Due to her status as an incorrigible otaku, it was a massive hit to her already poor social standing. Fortunately, she was a natural beauty. If not, she would have truly been damned. If a girl was both ugly and an otaku, what purpose could she possibly serve?</p><br/><p>Beauty was a bonus. She would be Moe as an otaku. If she was an ugly otaku, she would definitely be considered a female loser, destined to remain single forever\u2026</p><br/><p>A girl was not cute because she was Moe, she would only be Moe if she was cute!</p><br/><p>The current Yuan Shawu was something else entirely!</p><br/><p>This was Lady Zhao!</p><br/><p>Yuan Shawu ignored the beautiful girl her brother had brought back home. Her entire person was emitting an incomparably cool aura. Not only was she a Lady, she was once even a domineering, powerful empress. She could not just play the part of arrogance and cold, she WAS the embodiment of arrogance and cold!</p><br/><p>This place was just a temporary residence. When she got the resources, she would move out. She was not some girl who had to depend on a guy.</p><br/><p>She was no longer the good-for-nothing sister who relied on her brother!</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong was very happy to see that her sister had stepped out of the room. He was even happier to find that his sister was not even trying to avoid him. Instead, she seemed to be particularly arrogant, cold and calm, even emitting an inexplicable sense of pride\u2026</p><br/><p>His sister\u2019s change had gotten him rather excited. Within the book \u201cMy Sister Is Just So Cute\u201d that he was currently writing, the sister within the book was precisely such a proud, arrogant sister, the legendary, iconic tsundere character. Minus the embarrassment and hysterics.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong actually hoped that his real-life sister could be as energetic, proud and arrogant as the sister within the novel, while still completely relying on the protagonist. To be more precise, she would be barking orders at him, rather than rely on him. And her hapless brother would be more than willing to oblige. He found pleasure in it.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong was born to be this servile towards his sister. The only problem was that the previous Yuan Shawu would never make use of it. How could she possibly bring herself to do it? She was even thrown off by his niceness. If she truly got used to such nice treatment, the day she loses it would only be more painful.</p><br/><p>Now, Yuan Shawu would not have to fear such pain. Lady Zhao would not be as kind, nor as attached as Yuan Shawu. In her heart, she enjoyed others prostrating themselves before her. The more obedient, the more servility, and it would certainly be the best!</p><br/><p>To those who completely obeyed her, Lady Zhao would never be stingy with the rewards.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong stood before Yuan Shawu. He was like a dog wagging its tail before its master. In an extremely gentle voice, he asked, \u201cXiao Sha, why did you step out of the room?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Shawu replied in an arrogant, cold and majestical tone, \u201cAre you saying that I should remain in my room? Does this house belong to you alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>His sister\u2019s attitude was rather unsavory. Yet, Yuan Zhengzong swallowed the bitterness as if it were malt sugar. There were no limits to how low he could go when it came to his sister!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Sha, you should have said so since the beginning! I don\u2019t even own this house, it only belongs to you. This house is all yours!\u201d Yuan Zhengzong cried out.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting was unable to continue watching the scene. This rather large house was in the capital, Shanghai. On top of that, it was in a particularly nice sector. The housing price here was, tsk tsk\u2026 and, Yuan Zhengzong actually said that he wanted to give the house to his sister?</p><br/><p>At that instance, Qiu Yuting started wondering if it was a mistake for her to be falling in love with Yuan Zhengzong. Well, looking at his future achievements, she could let this slide, for now. If anything, she only found Yuan Shawu to be even more unpleasing than she had perceived!</p><br/><p>Yuan Shawu high and mighty attitude was downright inexcusable!</p></div>\n</div>"}

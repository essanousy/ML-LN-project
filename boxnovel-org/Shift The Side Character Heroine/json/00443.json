He was willing to sacrifice his IQ for easy, brainless cash. As a result, his stories had often come under heavy fire for good reason too, as all his female characters were basically clones</p><br/><p>Even so, his subscriber count spoke for itself. Despite all the talk, his subscriber-base remained strong. Sometimes when the male protagonist used a very brainless way to slap his own face, the numbers even spiked up!</p><br/><p>Now, he thoroughly understood. Those who harshly criticized his work were probably not among his regulars. They considered themselves to stand above this rabble. Reading this would be an insult to their intellect. Therefore, they reluctantly read the pirate version, convincing themselves that they were only there to see how low this book reached\u2026 Such an amazing sight!</p><br/><p>Longkong[1] ultimately brutalized this book in reviews. The highest rating available on Yousuu[2] was 10. This book had only scored 2.8. Many Longkong users groaned, \u201cHow is this brainless book selling so well? Who the heck even reads this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody knew how or why. It\u2019s undeniable popularity could not be explained by plausible means \u2014\u2014 No one could trace it to its source.</p><br/><p>Ironically, Xu Liangming was actually fearful that his sales might suffer from this sudden burst of inspiration. Such readers were usually keen on staying braindead. If that was the case, he would definitely have to rearrange the plot</p><br/><p>However, he was enjoying both great sales and great reviews!</p><br/><p>Therefore he started placing his blind faith in the \u201cintoxicated\u201d feeling. Never did he suspect that someone behind the scenes was pulling the strings. It was the illusion of free will!</p><br/><p>Soon, Zhao Youyue noticed that the writer had completely fallen subservient to her desires, and this had led to great effect. She was particularly pleased about such comments \u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen everyone talking about An Youyou and her real-life counterpart. I\u2019m one of those who have never even heard of the real life Ah Yu, and this has led me to start looking her up, out of curiosity. Looking at how she\u2019s been depicted in this book, I\u2019ve instantly became a fan! Still, I\u2019m curious. Is Lady Ah Yu in reality similarly innocent, real and unpretentious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! As a loyal audience of Ah Yu, I\u2019ve followed her since the beginning. She\u2019s just excellent at gaming, and she\u2019s extremely upstanding. It was my first time watching an anchor who did not even bat an eye at huge donations and tips!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know right, I love how she just flat out ignores Godly tycoons. It\u2019s epic. She\u2019s no poorer than them, if you see her streams of spamming cash for gacha in mobages. She could spend thousands in her sleep, and hundreds of thousands as a light stretch. But I do know this. She is truly unlucky at playing gachapon. She\u2019s an African chieftan[1]!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfrican chief +1. Anyway, if she was extremely lucky, we wouldn\u2019t have the chance to watch her spamming sprees anymore\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suggest that everyone just go watch Ah Yu\u2019s live broadcast. She\u2019s far more interesting than what you see in the book. One video would be enough. I assure you, you\u2019ll be her fan in no time. Unfortunately, she\u2019s now in her twelfth grade. She has been releasing all sorts of pigeons. She does not even turn the webcam on anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have much of a choice. With her webcam on, nobody would be paying attention to what she\u2019s doing. Everyone would just stare at her face (XD).\u201d</p><br/><p>Being picked as reference for the creation of fictional characters far from flattered Zhao Youyue. She was not against nor for it, but they had to at least do her justice, so that all parties are happy with the win-win situation. If not, it would just be like another \u201cAn Youyou.\u201d It only brought the fire upon both parties!</p><br/><p>The writer did just as his \u201cintoxicated\u201d state told him to. His work started earning positive reviews, and grew far more popular than before. Everything somehow went according to Zhao Youyue\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>Such was the extent of the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u2019s\u201d power. The writer had went according to the desires of its wielder, and now reaped the harvest. If not, things would have turned out entirely different</p><br/><p>Now that Zhao Youyue had cleared up the misunderstandings that concerned \u201cAn Youyou,\u201d she could now send her to her grave. What sort of \u201carranged death plot\u201d would be able to cheat all the readers?</p><br/><p>This was Zhao Youyue\u2019s solution. Lady An Youyou was already engaged to someone. This was very much in line with some writers\u2019 understanding about Ladies. Readers definitely thought the same. In their minds, all noble Ladies definitely had to be married to someone from a family of equal social rank. They were the victims of politically charged marriages.</p><br/><p>Therefore, An Youyou having an engagement seemed to be a very reasonable matter. Here\u2019s where the trouble began!</p><br/><p>An Youyou\u2019s fiance was undeniably a supervillain. He was the son of a famous noble family within the capital city. He was no small fry!</p><br/><p>Of course, in such brainless stories, sons of noble families were all brainless, witless characters. They did not have the temperament befitting that of nobility</p><br/><p>This fiance was called Ye Wudao. He was the stereotypical despicable, dirty, prurient, violent character. He was even involved in gangsterism! He was the so-called \u201cUnderground Emperor\u201d!</p><br/><p>\u201cI Love to Eat Pumpkin Pie\u201d was a veteran of creating such bland, mass-produced villains. He was a master hate-monger. He could write about the devil-incarnate and get away with it. As always, this made it even all the more satisfying to watch them getting slapped in the face!</p><br/><p>Fiance Ye Wudao was so despicable that readers were certainly anticipating the moment the male protagonist Zeng Dawei completely demolish the marriage between Ye Wudao and An Youyou reasonably\u2026 If An Youyou tied the knot with Ye Wudao, that would be a dead-knot of hell!</p><br/><p>Under Zhao Youyue\u2019s careful manipulation, the \u201cUnderground Emperor\u201d Ye Wudao soon discovered that An Youyou was trying to please a peasant in all kind of ways, by means of his many, many connections and informants. Naturally, he did not take kindly to it. He considered it the greatest form of betrayal ever!</p><br/><p>Thinking of the moment when he once f*cked a non-virgin beauty forcefully, he fumed in rage. How could he possibly tolerate having his own fiancee please some other guy now?</p><br/><p>Thus, the great villain, the \u201cUnderground Emperor\u201d Ye Wudao sent a killer after the male protagonist, Zeng Dawei!</p><br/><p>This killer was Hua Banhu. He was the \u201cNumber One Killer in Southeast Asia.\u201d With a rifle that was as long as he was tall, he sought to have Zeng Dawei in his cross-sight!</p><br/><p>Zeng Dawei had been completely unprepared. When Hua Banhu took his shot; it was as if An Youyou saw the sniper-caliber bullet flying at supersonic speeds. Let\u2019s just say that her desire for death had surpassed everything!</p><br/><p>She pushed the male protagonist out of the way, and took the bullet!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue exited in relieft. What an achievement!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Longkong \u2013 A web novel forum.</p><br/><p>[2]Yousuu \u2013 Yousuu.com is a reading and sharing platform that integrates novel search, follow-up reading, reader rating, and book recommendation.

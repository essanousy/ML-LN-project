He had his head bowed down, as depressed as a human can be, as if he was the one dying.</p><br/><p>If it had not been for Lin Meiyue, he wasn\u2019t even sure if he would have the courage to visit Chu Luoxun.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun noticed his saddened look. She cheered herself up, smiled at him and said, \u201cBeing sent into the ICU was a slight roadblock. That is my first time being in an ICU. The place makes me nervous\u2026Hey, don\u2019t give me that look, you\u2019re visiting me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry!\u201d apologized Gu Yuan immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! You have even brought me my favorite cake. I want to eat it outside.\u201d said Chu Luoxun with a wider smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing outside\u2026\u201d advised Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay in the ward!\u201d said Chu Luoxun capriciously.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun asked Gu Yuan to carry her on his back to the rooftop.</p><br/><p>As Gu Yuan was carrying her on his back, he grew all too aware of how light she actually was. He finally realized how much Chu Luoxun was suffering from her disease.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he felt like he was carrying the whole world. Her smile from the beginning was like a reminder to him that she was a perfect goddess who could kick away any form of disease!</p><br/><p>He remembered that being his first time being in such close contact with her. He suddenly hoped that he could carry her on his back forever. He recalled all the good times he had with her. He knew her hobbies very well. She loved dolls and sweets. She was a very soft-hearted and normal girl.</p><br/><p>However, in the past, he never dared get close to her. He always felt that she was too brilliant. She was unattainable, beyond his reach. It was only until this moment that he noticed that she was as much a mortal as he was. That was why she wouldn\u2019t be immune to diseases.</p><br/><p>The two of them reached the rooftop. Chu Luoxun saw the snow falling from the sky. Her smile grew wider. She could not help but praise the beauty of snowflakes.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun was gently placed on the bench. She asked, \u201cStill playing the piano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve found the abyss again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t continue playing anymore. Music has taken those close to me, one after another\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you still have Meiyue? Besides, I\u2019m feeling great as well! You still have me!\u201d Chu Luoxun smiled and said, \u201cMy surgery will be on 18th February. I will recover. I will never stop struggling until the very last moment. This is your fault, all because of you and Meiyue! Why am I so attached to this world? It\u2019s all because of the two of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true. Chu Luoxun\u2019s original body, Zhao Youyue, had always been a firm member of Lin Meiyue\u2019s fan club. She will never stop supporting them as a couple.</p><br/><p>18th February would also be the day of Gu Yuan\u2019s finals.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you struggle a little bit more? Aren\u2019t we both best at struggling? We have already entered the finals! Let\u2019s do it again!\u201d Chu Luoxun tried her best to encourage Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>The moment Gu Yuan heard the word \u2018again,\u2019 he remembered the picture of his one and only public ensemble with Chu Luoxun. He had been expecting to have a second one. However, due to her health condition, that window has passed.</p><br/><p>Everytime Gu Yuan thought of the picture; there would be infinite power flowing out from within his body. However, he replied, \u201cI have not touched the piano for a week. My fingers have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same as our first performance together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least I was still practicing regularly back then. I won\u2019t be able to play it now! It will be a miracle if I\u2019m able to do so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiracles\u2026can be created.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next scene is one of the most iconic scenes within the entire novel. Chu Luoxun showed her unique technique\u2014\u2014\u2018The Air Violin\u2019!</p><br/><p>This was a miracle that Chu Luoxun is showing in front of Gu Yuan right now!</p><br/><p>She stood up, stretched her hands towards the void and retrieved a violin from among the snowflakes in the sky\u2026</p><br/><p>She started performing with a calm smile on her face.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan did a double take in surprise, as if he had actually seen a transparent, dazzling violin appearing in her hands. She threw herself into her performance, and he could actually hear the sound of the violin!</p><br/><p>Of course, this was all Gu Yuan\u2019s imagination, but he would not be able to do so if it was not because of Chu Luoxun\u2019s lifelike expressions and convincing movements.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan felt like seeing the perfect goddess who was shining brightly on stage once again. The girl that he had been desiring but lacked the courage to approach</p><br/><p>This is her song of the spirit.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun definitely had tried everything to strangle the throat of her destiny. She even used her technique \u2018The Air Violin\u2019 to perform, even though she could no longer lift a real violin up.</p><br/><p>A strong sense of embarrassment emerged within Gu Yuan\u2019s heart. A person like him who is always giving up easily, is nothing at all, l compared to Chu Luoxun\u2019s determination in music.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, as long as you want it to be, a miracle will happen.\u201d Chu Luoxun stood bare-footed on the snow. Not that it mattered, she could no longer feel her legs. Still, she stood up. Her head was full of sweat. It was painful for her to even move by a little.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun finished talking and fell. Gu Yuan immediately helped her up. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re also within my heart, Gu Yuan. The two of you are the best friends of my life. I actually first saw you ten years ago. I was so lucky that I happened to meet you at that time. Unfortunately, we were never even acquainted. I\u2019ve known you for such a long time, and yet I do not know you as well as I do Meiyue. I truly admire her for knowing everything about you. I want to know more about you. Haha, perhaps in future. I will recover!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan was a bit dumbfounded. What\u2019s with that ten years situation?</p><br/><p>He only knew that she looked beautiful as she always did in the snow.</p><br/><p>Under the miracle performed by Chu Luoxun, Gu Yuan finally cheered up once again. He decided to convey his blessing towards Chu Luoxun through music on 18th February. Not only to Chu Luoxun, but also to all the people he loved and the entire audiences.</p><br/><p>This day had finally come. Chu Luoxun was being wheeled into the operating room. Before that, she had written a song for Gu Yuan\u2014\u2014 \u201cHappened to Meet You.\u201d</p><br/><p>Other than the song, there was also a precious photo, one that was kept by Chu Luoxun. It was Gu Yuan during his childhood. As Chu Luoxun took a selfie, he had somehow found his way into the frame. This was their only photoshoot together.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue still chose to leave, although she did not want to. It was for obvious reasons</p><br/><p>As Chu Luoxun, she had given it her all. As Zhao Youyue, she had set her other self\u2019s fate in stone. It had to be done.</p><br/><p>However, she had not yet left the literary world of \u201cBeautiful April\u201d yet. She went to Gu Yuan\u2019s competition scene.</p><br/><p>She would fulfill Chu Luoxun\u2019s last wish\u2014\u2014an ensemble with Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>As long as Gu Yuan\u2019s music reaches that realm, she will be able to appear within the music spiritually and complete the ensemble with him.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan would only be convinced that he is hallucinating, unsuspecting to the fact that he would be having a duet with an actual ghost.</p>\n</div>"}

His actions earned him the notice of the media, which consequently named him as the richest person in Douyu. CEO Z, one of the names commonly listed in the Top 10 Most Tipped People of Douyu, mentioned that Tian Shenluo might not be the first in Douyu ranks, but his family background was one of the richest in Douyu. His surname alone spoke volumes about him.</p><br/><p>Still, Tian Shenluo was simply a speck of dust in the eyes of Zhao Hao. Tian Shenluo could not be any richer than Ding Yuncong. This mysterious, low profiled individual was nothing, but a facade. Tian Shenluo wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to show off, if it was not Zhao Hao losing interest in spending money on live broadcasts.</p><br/><p>As everyone was worshipping Tian Shenluo with his 20 rockets flying across the bullet curtain, Boss Hao made his move and sent 40 rockets all over the screen, doubling that of Tian Shenluo\u2019s amount!</p><br/><p>There and then, another war of Gods of Tycoons commenced!</p><br/><p>The viewers were familiar and experienced enough to differentiate between promotion attempts by agencies and lavish gifting by rich tycoons. Tian Shenluo and Boss Hao were authentic private accounts, every penny spent was from own pockets!</p><br/><p>It was a rare scene in Douyu at that moment. Live broadcasting was no longer a new trend, hence the rich no longer paid as much attention. They were bored of the adrenaline rush experienced when dumping a lump sum of money, as netizens worshipped and cheered their names in rousing cries.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong was commonly seen giving away gifts that added up to millions to female broadcasters, even after he started his own live broadcasting channel. Rumors had it, that he had made certain agreements with those broadcasters to help promote their channel.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Ding Yuncong demonstrated great passion towards live broadcasting. However, that passion gradually died off, by judging from his online activity. He had set his sights on the Entertainment industry. Perhaps the actresses that he met in real life had more appeal.</p><br/><p>On the other hands, Zhao Hao had shifted his focus to his investment company. Age had affected the interests of these rich playboys.</p><br/><p>If Zhao Hao never learned that Ah Yu\u2019s real identity was his cousin Zhao Youyue, his own flesh and blood, he would not be so protective.</p><br/><p>He knew that Tian Shenluo was a rich and famous playboy, and was more than likely to have never seen a single video of Ah Yu\u2019s before. He probably happened to have caught sight of Ah Yu\u2019s beautiful face in the thumbnail, clicked in and became interested, before nonchalantly dumping his customary gifts.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu had indeed grown rather famous; buying the moon for her in front of all these witnesses was a commendable move!</p><br/><p>Indeed, Tian Shenluo felt an immeasurable volume of pride when he saw those audiences worshipping him across bullet screen, but his smile soon froze in place. A Boss Hao had sent 40 rockets; a challenge to his face!</p><br/><p>Without hesitating, Tian Shenluo sent another 60 rockets, quaking the broadcast. In that short moment, Ah Yu had received 120 rockets, almost worth 60,000 RMB!</p><br/><p>Looking at the 60 rockets flown in by Tian Shenluo, Zhao Hao smiled silently, doubled the amount, and sent out 120 rockets!</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao would not give away that number one position in the Fans Ranking. He wanted to show Zhao Youyue that one must not succumb to the flapping of a playboy\u2019s money, the Zhao family could more than hold its own against such a battle.</p><br/><p>Other than Tian Shenluo and Boss Hao, the other audiences joined in on the rocket gifting and sent their own rockets. Ah Yu\u2019s channel started to draw the attention of gossip news broadcasters.</p><br/><p>Ai Ai Ai Young Lady was one of the notable audience members. She was also known as Aichan, [1] the Douyu tycoon. This mysterious young lady had her own Douyu team, in which all of its members carried a glimmering Noble Title, emphasizing on the entrance of Aichan\u2019s majestic calvary.</p><br/><p>Aichan had no intention of participating in this war among Tian Shenluo and Boss Hao, and merely dropped off a few rockets in passing.</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo was furious when he witnessed the 120 rockets cascading in Boss Hao\u2019s wake. He did not know Boss Hao well, only knowing that Boss Hao had spent almost 10 million in online games.</p><br/><p>Yes, he did. So what?</p><br/><p>He, Tian Shenluo, was not some guy who needed to dig into corporate fund to buy gifts for some broadcaster. He did not have to play the deceptive role of a faux-tycoon. Money was not his concern. Hence he gifted 140 rockets, repeating the same action of 20 rocket-upping Zhao Hao.</p><br/><p>The audience was traumatized, overwhelmed by the raging war between tycoons. Envious broadcasters who had dropped in only grew with jealousy. This broadcast was daylight robbery!</p><br/><p>Other female broadcasters would have gone crazy if this had happened to them, but not Zhao Youyue. Within minutes, she received 380 rockets. Along with the gifts from other audience members, it totaled up to more than 200,000 RMB! All she did was show her face, she had not even started her programme!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue remained calm and gracefully thanked the audiences, as if she was totally unaware of the nuclear war between tycoons. What else could she do anyway, cry tears of joy?</p><br/><p>Money had never attracted Zhao Youyue. Be it one rocket or hundreds of rockets, she treated them the same.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao did not stop there. He doubled up with 280 rockets!</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo did not gift 300 rockets but 521 rockets, which meant I love you in Chinese a blatant act of flirtation, directed at Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao, enraged by such an action towards his cousin, gifted 1314 rockets in retaliation!</p><br/><p>Never before had the history of Douyu witnessed such an amount, as the total RMB spent for that single act was more than 600,000 RMB!</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo paused for a few seconds, and gave up altogether when he saw Zhao Hao launching another 1314 rockets!</p><br/><p>Damn! It was more than one million RMB! Was Boss Zao out of his mind?</p><br/><p>Boss Hao had broken the record of Douyu\u2019s Highest Gifts Value Within a Day!</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo was unbeknownst to the fact that Zhao Hao\u2019s father was in Douyu\u2019s board of directors. His actions had increased the revenue of Douyu, increasing his father\u2019s dividends. He would be the one inheriting all of it!</p><br/><p>Tian Shenluo had no idea this female broadcaster was Zhao Hao\u2019s cousin, which was why Zhao Hao would never let go of the top position in her Fan\u2019s ranking!</p><br/><p>The war was Zhao Hao\u2019s!</p><br/><p>Ah Yu popularity was boosted to 4,000,000, momentarily becoming the most popular broadcaster in Douyu!</p><br/><p>As Boss Hao and Tian Shenluo were dumping money into Ah Yu\u2019s channel, other live broadcasts had been prompted with advertisements, guiding viewers who loved to be part of a lively crowd to Ah Yu\u2019s live broadcast.</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] Aichan is a Japanese nickname, where \u201cchan\u201d is a diminutive suffix to express that speaker finds a person endearing. Ai was a reference to Ai Ai Ai Young Lady.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

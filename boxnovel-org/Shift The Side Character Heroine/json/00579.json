One would not understand the feeling of being under the spotlight and the constant camera flashing if one was not a celebrity. Peace no longer existed in their life.</p><br/><p>So, why did she return?</p><br/><p>This was the part of the mystery that had yet to be solved, and there were many possible reasons for this. Going back to the theory from the previous chapter, she might have surpassed her supposed limits. It was also not far-fetched to note that most of her roles after university were a lot better. Her acting skills had already torn through conventional standards \u2013 which was very typical of geniuses.</p><br/><p>Some even mentioned that she was out of cash. It had all been used up when she toured the world during her absence. She must have taken a space shuttle to space, so she had to return and earn more money.</p><br/><p>This was probably the most ludicrous theory ever, considering how filthy rich friends surrounded her. She would never be out of cash. There was also the supported fact that Zhang Guorong was never a fan of luxury goods. She only wore them because she was asked to, but she never actually bought any with her own money.</p><br/><p>A god tier actress would never go broke, unless she was plain stupid.</p><br/><p>Keeping all of this in mind, Zhao Youyue deduced that Zhang Guorong had returned to the acting world, refreshed and more determine than ever, thanks to the moisturizing effects of love. She was no longer afraid of the media, as she had her lover, her bosom friend, Tang Tang.</p><br/><p>Tang Tang would always have her back. She fetched her here and there, they went on dates, she bought her presents, they went on vacations together, and even helped her with her financial management. Whenever she was tired, whenever she had fun, whenever she slept, Tang Tang would always be with her.</p><br/><p>In reality, most pictures of her and Tang Tang mostly contained nothing special but the two of them sitting in the back of Tang Tang\u2019s luxurious car, or Tang Tang accompanying her to banquets.</p><br/><p>So, we could over-generalize and say: wherever the spirited Zhang Guorong went, the silent Tang Tang would be there to bring balance.</p><br/><p>Whenever they were together, Zhang Guorong would seem as joyful as a child, like a pampered significant other, showing a warm and cute expression.</p><br/><p>Once when it was raining outdoors, Tang Tang rushed to fetch Zhang Guorong. She got off from a distance, got into the rain to pass an umbrella to her Rong-chan \u2013 before running back to the car to pick her up.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guorong had smiled warmly as she held her umbrella, looking at her lover in the car. Such was the love of protecting each other, the unspoken little things \u2013 the warmest form of conveying your love.</p><br/><p>Again, this was what Zhao Youyue came up with \u2013 based on a single picture taken by the media. It had Zhang Guorong holding an umbrella in the rain, waiting for Tang Tang to drive her car over. And so, Zhao Youyue wrote an entire romance novel out of it.</p><br/><p>For all you know, the picture was just an innocent, candid shot of two friends. Best buddies could have bumped into each other by chance. Best buddies fetched each other in the rain, or under any other circumstances, for that matter. Wasn\u2019t it perfectly normal?</p><br/><p>This was the rumored \u201cWriting a story based on a picture\u201d skill. Now that we take a closer look at things, Lady Zhao had a Lady Tang of her own, right? Her heart should have long realized it \u2013 if she was anyone else other than Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>If she had a wife like Zhang Guorong, she would definitely protect her with all her heart. She would have no problems taking care of her for all eternity.</p><br/><p>To be honest, Zhao Youyue started off trying to imagine the relationship between Zhang Guorong and Tang Tang. But as she dug deeper into their past, she found some evidence that seemed to suggest it being more than just friendship.</p><br/><p>That was why she created such a story. 70% true, with 30% of her bullshit.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guorong often mentioned Tang Tang. She never ran out of praises for her. Something in her tone seemed to say that she was highly protective of Tang Tang. She probably revered her too, for she often placed herself on a lower ground to praise Tang Tang. Whenever Tang Tang got in trouble, she would lend her money to help Tang Tang overcome her difficulties.</p><br/><p>She was sorry for Tang Tang. That woman had taken far too many hits for her \u2013 she had even been forced to toss her job and personal life aside. (In reality, women\u2019s lives at their workplace was already pretty messed up from the start) She would wrap things up by saying that Tang Tang had given her so much, there was no way she could ever repay her.</p><br/><p>On the internet, pictures of Tang Tang and Zhang Guorong holding hands can be found. The public back then still believed their relationship to be pure and clean. It was good being a girl, they could hold hands together and not be accused of being homosexuals. If men did this, eyebrows would rise.</p><br/><p>The pictures brought forth that peaceful warmth, the outlines around their heads illuminated by the street lamps, where poor, obsolete camera technology led to an overexposure of the lamp bulbs themselves, leading to lens flare at the edge of the image. Some might even notice that these lovebirds even walked at the same pace, in perfect sync.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue once again started her secret interview. As Zhang Guorong, she happily listened to how the host kept praising her other half, saying \u201cI think she is terrific\u201d or \u201cShe is my lover, my friend, my sister, basically a present from God.\u201d</p><br/><p>She shared all her fortune with Tang Tang, even the companies that she owned were under a linked name account. Her car-plate also carried a special meaning, TZ1314 \u2014 Tang Zhang together forever.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guorong had noticed that stalkers had been stalking them and taking photos. Even so, she did not distance herself, but instead, she purposely grabbed hold of Tang Tang\u2019s hand for the stalkers to see. When Tang Tang noticed the flashing lights behind them. She turned as saw her lover\u2019s determined face. Without turning back to look at the lights again, she took hold of the hand in her\u2019s, and held it firmly, assuringly.</p><br/><p>As they crossed the road to their home, their hands never left each other. It had become second nature to them.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue sat back to survey her handiwork. It now had all the sweetness in the world, but it lacked the impact. She knew just what to do. She had done it so many times already. Give it a depressing, tragic end. Strike readers in their hearts, and strike it hard. Make it almost impossible to extricate.</p><br/><p>This was not going to be too difficult. Zhang Guorong\u2019s body was never found. Also, whatever photos of her that existed only had her in her prime, at the height of her beauty. It turned her from legend to myth.</p><br/><p>Lady Tang was as drop-dead gorgeous as her lover. If anything, she was just slightly above average. Her jawline was hard and chiseled, giving her the impression of a boss \u2013 since she had spent a lifetime battling on the frontlines of her Rong-chan\u2019s bank account.</p><br/><p>Tang Tang remained unmarried until the end, which only supported how strong their love was.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s version of the legendary actor Zhang Guorong added up to the limited intel on the real thing. So it had to be completely true. Zhao Youyue now wondered if she should get Su Li to draw a yuri manga featuring Zhang Guorong and Tang Tang. Why not use the time they went to the South Pole for a vacation? Wouldn\u2019t that be special?</p></div>\n</div>"}

Even gunfire would not faze her. Rolls and leaps would save her life.</p><br/><p>In the game, some players had attempted to kill Jane Doe Su by using techniques such as \u201cThe Poisonous Flying Knife of Justice,\u201d and \u201cThe Arrow of Justice.\u201d Even those projectiles had been useless. She somehow rolled away, not even sparing the thinnest sheets of errors</p><br/><p>She was the \u201cLaw of Humane Justice.\u201d How could the \u201cLaw of Humane Justice\u201d possibly be afraid of being assassinated by some gangsters?</p><br/><p>Now that Zhao Youyue was Jane Doe Su in reality, she felt as if she could take on just about anything. Of course, if the enemy whipped out a bazooka or something, she would be left helpless. But, who would possibly use such a weapon to assassinate someone?</p><br/><p>The possibility of her being targeted for an assassination was actually beyond slim. Now that she had obtained the Jane Doe Su character card, her personal safety issues could be put at rest. She was even confident that she would no longer require bodyguards.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue would not fall into complacency. Having this iconic character card active also led to her feeling wild and reckless. She felt like charging out into the world, finding a target to kill. Zhao Youyue\u2019s nature could probably curb these feelings.</p><br/><p>Activating the card for the briefest of instances had already made her agonizingly uncomfortable, both mentally and physically. Such a powerful character card was almost overwhelming to her senses</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue promptly turned the card off. She felt as if she had just returned from hell. This was why Jane Doe Su had been so adamant to \u201clive in the dark, yet her heart always directed towards the light\u201d!</p><br/><p>If she had Jane Doe Su\u2019s power, she might have acted the same. Her power had not been casually obtained, it was something that she had been honing unremittingly since childhood</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su was a stubborn girl. She was relatively obtuse yet honest. Such individuals would be blessed in the martial arts training aspect. In other aspects, she would be comparatively weak. Some players criticized that if Jane Doe Su had half of Yan Qingmeng\u2019s ability at speaking, they would not have ended up being cheated so devastatingly by Deity Yan.</p><br/><p>It would have been a far better choice, for Jane Doe Su actually had what it took to become an idol for the sake of the anonymous city. Why stay as a silly girl, saving people everywhere \u2013 alone, with a single sword? In the end, more than half the people she had saved were ruthless and cruel-hearted</p><br/><p>Why are you players laughing? I\u2019m talking about you guys!</p><br/><p>But as time went by, everything was eventually revealed. People gradually understood the simple mind of Jane Doe Su. She became highly popular among male players.</p><br/><p>She also gave others reason to be pleased with themselves.</p><br/><p>As one played a game, he or she would feel like a \u201cGod.\u201d Even a slow-handed player would never admit that he had a lower IQ than a computer. This was Old Sly Zha Feng\u2019s game, of course it cheated on everyone and everything.</p><br/><p>Therefore, players preferred pretending to be awesome, while commenting feverishly on national events within the game. They were just like modern persons who had traveled back to ancient times and other unknown worlds. They might not be powerful, but they were exceptionally confident in their own knowledge.</p><br/><p>Players who had walked firmly on the path of the beautiful and gentle Jane Doe Su would experience the pleasure of slowly dominating, and ordering Jane Doe Su about. Of course, such pleasure would be short-lived. Within the process, they would fall in love, having been captivated by such a silly girl. When the girl fails to escape her death once again, the players would only suffer heartbreak, all over again!</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su had grown rather popular indeed. More and more of her fanart and doujinshi were released. Female live streamers started cosplaying as her. This was just like the \u201cbeautiful and gentle 2B\u201d from the other world. One need not play the game to learn of her. Her influence had spanned beyond the game. All her related products were selling exceptionally well!</p><br/><p>Such was the power of an iconic character!</p><br/><p>Speaking of Jane Doe Su cosplays, let us speak of \u201cDemon King,\u201d also known as \u201cI am a Lolicon II.\u201d She was a live streamer of extreme beauty and a great body. She was capable of pulling off convincing 2D characters cosplays, making it seem like they existed in real life. This time, she had cosplayed Jane Doe Su as well, and many audiences had been stunned by her beauty. Of course, others slammed her for it, saying that Jane Doe Su did not have such a vulgar body.</p><br/><p>Jane Doe Su was indeed a pitiful creature. She lived her entire life like an ascetic. She was even worthy of quoting the classical paragraph within \u201cHow the Steel Was Tempered.\u201d Something that went along the lines of, \u201cA human should live his life this way. When \u201c.</p><br/><p>This \u201cDemon King\u201d was awfully lazy. She was ridiculed as \u201cI\u2019m everywhere except the live streaming room.\u201d She was also a self-proclaimed game lover. Her playthrough of the DLC had circulated around a lesbian route with Jane Doe Su. That\u2019s right. She played a female character, teasing Jane Doe Su in all manner. It had been a feast for her male viewers. Her viewers would spend sleepless nights, fantasizing about what that could have been.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue was the genuine hidden cosplay boss, considering the fact that those characters and her were basically one. She had already sought out for someone to tailor-make her a Jane Doe Su\u2019s costume. Let\u2019s not forget the blindfold! She had felt so overwhelmed earlier on, as she had been without a blindfold to shield her eyes</p><br/><p>After all, a Jane Doe Su without a blindfold was in her second stage of transformation. It was as if she had casted the great spell \u2013 \u201cDemon Disintegration\u201d[1]. A grey-clad, blindfolded Jane Doe Su was subdued and inhibited.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue started to put herself through daily training. Otherwise, she would never be able to control this Jane Doe Su character card completely. She also started taking a leaf out of Jane Doe Su\u2019s memory, and started practicing in sword dance!</p><br/><p>Sword dancer, Zhao Youyue, here\u2019s my debut! The only thing missing now was the sword</p><br/><p>As the world would always adjust to accommodate for her power levels, Zhao Youyue would never be able to emulate Jane Doe Su entirely. Still, this was good training for her mind and body, and it led to her perfection, so all was good.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:[1] Demon Disintegration \u2013 A kind of fictional great martial art spell. The spell can stimulate the potential of the caster\u2019s body, so that his power is greatly enhanced. After the spell duration ended, the caster\u2019s body function will be severely degraded, or he will die.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

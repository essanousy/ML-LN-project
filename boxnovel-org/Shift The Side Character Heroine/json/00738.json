She was not a member of the Endless Squad. She was just an indigene of some apocalyptical world. She had started off as a beauty scientist. By the end of the apocalypse, she might end up as a plaything\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the apocalypse. Due to the collapse of social order, those elites who were originally of higher social status would undergo a tremendous change of fate. So what if she was a scientist before the world went to hell? They would only target her well-developed body.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had chosen this character as her target. The underlying factor was how she was indeed the one with the best looks, among those passerby female characters, even if she was already over her 30s.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zhao Youyue considered the character\u2019s identity as a scientist to be highly suitable. She would go easy on the cheats as well. The question that had no immediate answer now was how easily applicable would this world\u2019s dark technology be, with regards to real-world physics\u2026</p><br/><p>At least, she was able to give Zhang Yanwei the \u201csudden inspiration\u201d attribute. She may not be exceptionally intelligent, but she had no fear when it came to heading for new approaches. Whereas, the upcoming apocalyptical world was the kind of \u201cglobal evolutionary\u201d apocalypse.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this \u201cglobal evolutionary,\u201d exactly?</p><br/><p>There was a movie named \u201cRampage.\u201d The animals in the movie had evolved, due to a kind of virus. But that movie had been relatively childish. There were only three beasts in total.</p><br/><p>In this apocalyptical dungeon, all the animals and plants had started evolving, due to a mysterious power. Perhaps it was due to the descent of a meteorite. The first person who observed the meteorite had been Zhang Yanwei, the beauty scientist.</p><br/><p>Master PhD might have even given this beauty scientist a few more scenes. But she might have forgotten about it as she proceeded on the plot. She soon got lost in the interactions and passion between men. As for this female within \u201cEndless Apocalypse?\u201d She was just playing a small role as a passerby character.</p><br/><p>At the time of global evolution, humans happened to have no ability to evolve. Then, they realized that the weapons they were so proud of, were completely ineffective against some of those evolved plants. Or rather, humanity was able to suppress the plants in the beginning. But plants were evolving way too rapidly. It was just like insects reacting to insecticide. Use it on them often enough, and they would develop some form of resistance to it. Those highly evolved plants could now resist human firepower to a degree.</p><br/><p>Even in the middle of the ocean, a new strain had emerged \u2014\u2014 Ama. They could manipulate water, like the mythical children of the ocean.</p><br/><p>When there was an Ama, there would be Wingmen. They had been born with the ability to fly. Their vision was particularly good. After such a unique species with inherently unique abilities got their hands on human technology, their attitudes towards humans would be abnormally arrogant. They would find them absolutely disdainful. They considered humans to be the species destined to be eliminated within the global evolution this time round.</p><br/><p>All in all, all the new intelligent species in this world had sensed the coming of a new generation. Weaklings like humans did not belong at the top of the biological chain! They should be eliminated!</p><br/><p>Perhaps somewhere, due to some ancestral recesses of memories in their genes, they still feared being dominated by humans. Now, they could hop on human\u2019s head and be their master!</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue possessed on Zhang Yanwei, the apocalypse had yet to occur. So was the Endless Squad yet to be formed. She also did not know when the apocalypse would come. But this did not hinder her from making preparations in advance for the apocalypse. As long as Master PhD did not specifically write about this character, her doings within the world would remain undetected, even by its author.</p><br/><p>She no longer cared about Master PhD not living up to her end of the bargain. Instead, she began her new life with great interest. Perhaps this life was cruel and challenging. Compared to reality which was too quiet and peaceful, life within this literary world would be very interesting.</p><br/><p>Aside from the \u201cMAX research ability,\u201d \u201csudden inspiration,\u201d \u201cmadness\u201d unique attributes of a scientist she had given Zhang Yanwei, she had set a new attribute, \u201cReincarnated.\u201d This would serve as a perfect explanation behind her preparation in advance for the apocalypse.</p><br/><p>Of course, she was not an actual reincarnated person. Zhang Yanwei was probably the first human to have evolved with the coming of the apocalypse. She could see the \u201cfuture.\u201d Or, she could see the events of another world line.</p><br/><p>If Zhang Yanwei had not gained Zhao Youyue\u2019s eye, as a passerby who had not appeared in the scene for very long, without any additional aura, without any unique abilities powerful enough, she might have been destined for a tragic end. Perhaps she would be placed into various postures, and then get \u201cplayed\u201d by the mob until she was \u201cbroken.\u201d That was probably the plotline of an apocalyptical H article. Perhaps it was what certain psycho-readers loved the most.</p><br/><p>One of the charms of apocalyptic works was the process of a loser turning the situation around and becoming the master, while crushing those bigwigs, and elites beneath his feet, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue\u2019s intervention, Zhang Yanwei had transformed from a very common researcher into an internationally well-known scientist and scholar, the Madame Curie of the current age. Her research was at the forefront of Physics, of the very metaphysical kind.</p><br/><p>Despite Zhang Yanwei\u2019s perfect appearance and body, she was determined to dedicate her entire life onto her scientific career and had long resolved to be single for the rest of her life. This matter had won her countless fans and suitors from all over the globe. She was already 36, but she still seemed to draw many more pursuers who considered themselves worthy.</p><br/><p>Frankly speaking, such an excellent beauty scientist probably would only appear within a literary world. She was an almost cliche Mary Sue. Almost. Real beauties would never be able to hook up with a large and luxurious concept like \u201cscience\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue hoped that when Zhang Yanwei appeared within Master PhD\u2019s reality work, she would be written in a \u201csuspense unveiled\u201d kind of way. Only in this way would there be the greatest surprise and shock when her true secret and purpose were unveiled in the end!</p><br/><p>In the beginning, perhaps she was indeed a passerby character. Even if she was a scientist, she would only be mediocre at most. But no one would expect her to be an actual mad scientist!</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue possessed Zhang Yanwei, she immediately started preparing for the apocalypse. The first question would be: How was she going to allow the human population to learn of the coming of the apocalypse?</p></div>\n</div>"}

It was not to prove that she was a tycoon. It was simply meant to prove that her family was not poor!</p><br/><p>The rumors changed once more, saying that she chose to suffer, acting rich when she was actually not\u2026</p><br/><p>However, everyone only took more pity on her. They promised not to talk about her family financial conditions anymore.</p><br/><p>Anyway, as long as she has flying colors, she was still worthy of being respected, regardless of her family conditions!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had given up explaining. The more she explained, the worse things became. Some people were truly silly!</p><br/><p>She consoled herself, \u201cAt least, Master Leng Zi\u2019s \u201cBeautiful April\u201d has been AMWAYed, it was worth it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng was also speechless. Why couldn\u2019t the rumor spreaders add Zhao Youyue\u2019s Wechat ID and take a look at her newsfeed, or her friend list?</p><br/><p>At the same time, Han Leng was touched by Zhao Youyue\u2019s efforts in AMWAYing \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d He had a feeling that she was not planning to prove her Lady identity. Her actual purpose was to AMWAY the novel\u2026</p><br/><p>However, no matter how touched Han Leng was, he would not lose his focus on Goddess Chu!</p><br/><p>Luckily, his best brother Chen Haoran finally realized that Zhao Youyue was not a poor elite scholar. She was a Lady tycoon. She was a person who would travel around the world every long holiday\u2026</p><br/><p>Therefore, Chen Haoran gave up on his funny plan on the donation for Zhao Youyue. Instead, he took the initiative to refute the rumors for Zhao Youyue. However, it was not proving to be very effective. Someone seemed to be giving Zhao Youyue a firm label\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>She is an inspirational girl. Although her family is poor, she studied hard. She is full of positive energy. She is the example for all students!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s attitude towards this matter was like \u201cYeah yeah yeah, You\u2019re right. I\u2019m so poor. Therefore I study hard, because knowledge can change my destiny!\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of everything else, she was in a good mood. She was still delighted with her progress within the literary world.</p><br/><p>In the literary world.</p><br/><p>\u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 received an invitation to the celebration concert. It was a special public performance to commemorate something. This performance was precisely meant to celebrate \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds participation in the music competition. That had also been the first ensemble between her and Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>Those who are able to attend the performance were the winners and the top runner-ups. This was not a competition anymore. It was a real concert. The more personal touches, the better.</p><br/><p>This was the opportunity for \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 and the male protagonist, Gu Yuan to have a public ensemble for the second time.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan remembered the wonderful experience when he had his first public ensemble with \u2018Chu Luoxun.\u2019 He chose to agree, spurred on by Lin Meiyue\u2019s encouragement.</p><br/><p>\u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 chose to perform \u201cLove\u2019s Sorrow\u201d by Fritz Chrysler[1].</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan seemed to have remembered something. He wanted to switch it to a vibrant and popular song. However, \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 had already set her mind, ignoring Gu Yuan\u2019s refutation. Anyway, they were only serving as foils, a low-key song like this would be suitable for their roles.</p><br/><p>Actually, \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 knew something else. This was a knot within Gu Yuan\u2019s heart\u2014\u2014 His mother\u2019s most favorite song.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat made you choose to face the piano again?\u201d asked Gu Yuan\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day in April, I met a violinist who was blessed by the God of Music. She was always full of absolute confidence. She had an extremely confident smile. Even when she encounters troubles during her performance, she would continue her performance. I was forcefully pushed onto the stage by her. Yet, I found a scenery the likes of which I have never seen before\u2026and I want to take a look at that beautiful scenery once more.\u201d replied Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan\u2019s father was very pleased. He knew that Gu Yuan was stepping out from his mental shadow.</p><br/><p>\u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 started her ensemble with Gu Yuan. Lin Meiyue joined them at the same time. \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was slowly preparing to have Lin Meiyue take her place.</p><br/><p>There was once upon a time when the three of them walked back home together. Night had already fallen. They passed by a forest. There were many fireflies within the forest. \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 could not help feeling that the fireflies were like the lights of life. They were so weak, yet they were desperately glowing, just like heartbeats.</p><br/><p>With Han Leng\u2019s hipster writing, this \u2018Forest of Fireflies\u2019 scenery was absolutely beautiful. It was obviously another foreshadow</p><br/><p>\u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was like the sun, shining brightly forever. However, her body was actually as fragile as those fireflies.</p><br/><p>How much longer would she hold out?</p><br/><p>\u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was hugging her favorite violin, asking it to accompany her longer.</p><br/><p>Just when expectations reached the peak, when numerous readers in reality expected to enjoy \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 and Gu Yuan\u2019s second ensemble, something happened to \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 in the end. She had been putting in so much effort when practicing the \u201cLove\u2019s Sorrow\u201d with Gu Yuan. Yet, she did not appear on time, on the actual day. No one was able to contact her via phone.</p><br/><p>Many audiences and judges who were present on that day expected \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds performance the most, especially the judge who appreciated her flair the most. He indicated that he had not been so excited for a very long time. He was just like \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019s\u2019 top fan.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue chose to buy more time for \u2018Chu Luoxun.\u2019 They asked for the next violinist, hoping that he could perform in advance, but were eventually rejected. The violinist expressed his disdain towards \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 saying that her performance was a mess. She did not respect the competition or the judges. He further concluded that her lifestyle must be very messy as well. Just because she had some talent, she had gotten carried away, being late as if nothing happened.</p><br/><p>There goes the twist again. Han Leng would never allow a single dull moment. If the ensemble just happens like that without any rivals, how would the readers get excited?</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan thought that the violinist\u2019s words were a bit too much. However, the violinist said, \u201cIsn\u2019t the current situation proof in itself?\u201d</p><br/><p>The violinist indicated that the soul of music lay within the music score. That messy improvisation should not be called as music at all!</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan was stunned. He seemed to be seeing a ghost of himself from the past\u2026</p><br/><p>In the past, Gu Yuan was also a pianist who would have stood firmly behind that idea!</p><br/><p>He laughed. First, he apologized sincerely to the violinist. Then, \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds music echoed within his mind again. He laughed with more confidence and spoke to the \u2018violinist version of Gu Yuan,'\u201dAlthough you\u2019re the final contestant, we\u2019re the main protagonists today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan pulled Lin Meiyue onto the stage!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cLove\u2019s Sorrow\u201d by Fritz Chrysler \u2013 Fritz Chrysler (February 2, 1875 January 29, 1962) was an Austrian-born violinist and composer.

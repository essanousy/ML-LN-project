He just did not expect Yang Ming to be worst off. Just not so long ago, he was sticking like glue with his childhood friend Li XiaoTong, yet his heart had changed completely all of a sudden. Well, he realized that Liu Sha was more to his liking, and was deeply touched by the changes in her as well\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Yang Ming kept wandering between the two, until Li Xiaotong decided to stomp into his house based on her female\u2019s intuition. She made quite a scene, stating that she could not stand Liu Sha anymore. But, Liu Sha stated that she was able to tolerate anything and this led Yang Ming to make his decision. Actually Yang Ming felt awesome during his times with Liu Sha, as he could spend all the money he wanted. He was even willing to have a high-class dinner with Liu Sha, instead of going home for Li Xiaotong\u2019s home-cook dishes.</p><br/><p>Up to this point, Jiang Chao hated the male protagonist even more. He just hoped that Su Li would not believe in the crappy concept of \u201ctake all virgins\u201d and made Xu Jing and Yang Xixi his lovers. That was the only thing he could never accept. Besides, his only wish was that Xu Jing and Yang Xixi could live happily together.</p><br/><p>However, the subsequent development of the story was completely out of Jiang Chao\u2019s expectation!</p><br/><p>Never had he thought that Li Xiaotong would stab Yang Ming to death with a kitchen knife, all because she could not accept that Yang Ming would choose Liu Sha over her. She even sat on Yang Ming\u2019s body and continued stabbing his dead body; the scene had suddenly become a gory and violent one!</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao had not even gotten the chance to finish his instant noodle, and lost all his appetite at once. He even wanted to throw up the everything he just ate\u2026</p><br/><p>Why did the drawing style changed to this in a twinkling?</p><br/><p>With Su Li\u2019s drawing skill at its peak, the continuous stabbing scene was very realistic and convincing! Had anyone been standing in the shoes of the childhood friend, Li Xiaotong, they would be extremely satisfied. Because a scumbag like Yang Ming definitely deserved to be stabbed to death!</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao was relieved. If he had been standing in the male protagonist\u2019s shoes, he would be in a painful euphoria as he had dreamed that all his women could live together peacefully. To think that he would be killed by his childhood friend who used to love him, by stabbing him to death while riding on his body!</p><br/><p>In any case, Jiang Chao felt a weird satisfaction over the stabbing, though he still considered his three views to be normal. Ever since becoming a scumbag, Yang Ming had despised the male protagonist completely. Even though he always read it with excitement, especially every single time when the male character had a disagreement, he would have sex with the females. Of course, this was all thanks to the contribution of the artist Su Li. In order to respect her hard-work, he had to give all of himself to examine the work thoroughly, anyway that was his initial intention. However, he failed to get rid of the dirty thoughts which were burning inside of his body after reading it. He could only say that Su Li\u2019s drawing skill was out of this world\u2026</p><br/><p>Since Yang Ming was dead, Jiang Chao had a higher expectation from the story. If he had not mistaken, Yang Ming became a scumbag because of the mastermind, Xu Jing. She did not do anything to Yang Ming directly, but she manipulated the good impression of the girls who laid out for Yang Ming, and made them fought over him using methods. This led Li Xiaotong to be dumped, darkened and eventually killed the male protagonist in the end. Obviously, Xu Jing had achieved her objective \u2013 to make Yang Xixi give up on Yang Ming completely.</p><br/><p>This could not be wrong. Yang Ming was already dead. If so, why would Yang Xixi still hold her love for her brother?</p><br/><p>Hmm, the ending should be something like\u2026 Xu Jing and Yang Xixi living happily together ever after?</p><br/><p>A satisfying smile took over Jiang Chao\u2019s face, but continuing reading the story, his eyes were widely opened as the story developed. He had no idea that Liu Sha possessed such an impressive knifemanship. Not only did Liu Sha end Li Xiaotong\u2019s life with a cleaver, she had even cut open Li Xiaotong\u2019s belly, just to make sure the latter was not bearing a child. Oh, that felt so good!</p><br/><p>Obviously, Liu Sha was darkened due to Yang Ming\u2019s death. They had promised to be each other\u2019s guardian angel, but Yang Ming was sent to heaven unexpectedly by Li Xiaotong. She could only use such an extreme way to take revenge on Li Xiaotong.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao felt that the ending was really a twist of plot, both intense and exciting. The scene where Liu Sha was cutting Li Xiaotong with the cleaver was also shockingly gruesome, which corrupted his mind. He questioned himself if he had read a fake \u201cPure Romance\u201d.</p><br/><p>Later when Liu Sha was shot to death due to her resisting the arrest and assaulting the police officer, he felt that the development was getting really cheap!</p><br/><p>Why is the ending getting more and more out of line?</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Chao still had his high hopes on one last thing. This was also his biggest motivation for reading \u201cPure Romance\u201d. He thought naturally, would Xu Jing and Yang Xixi be able to live together happily or not?</p><br/><p>As long the ending stayed that way, all the previous corruption would be purified at once. If the ending was the other way round\u2026 hahaha, how would an accident like that possibly occur?</p><br/><p>The gorgeous and kind-hearted Su Li had stated affirmatively, that the ending would be a happy reunion. The previous part of the ending must be just an accident; the real happy ending must be referring to the beautiful yuri love between Xu Jing and Yang Xixi, right?</p><br/><p>There could not go wrong; it had to be that way!</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao was smiling radiantly, until he saw the \u201cnice boat\u201d ending which sent him to the verge of collapsing!</p><br/><p>Yang Xixi brought her brother\u2019s head and sailed to sea, leaving Xu Jing behind!</p><br/><p>How could she have such a level of brother complex as a sister?</p><br/><p>Why was she so hell-bent on her brother?</p><br/><p>This was completely f*ucked up!</p><br/><p>That bright smile freezed on his face, as if he was in a meltdown. Especially when it came down to that graceful scene where \u201cXu Jing walked towards the sea under the sunset, and was completely swallowed up by the sea\u201d, Jiang Chao had an outburst of emotion.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xu Jing became the most ravishing female character in \u201cPure Romance\u201d. She was crying and smiling at the same time, and said that studying was her most beloved thing. Her passion for learning had been implanted deeply into the readers\u2019 minds and hearts.</p><br/><p>Whenever readers thought of Xu Jing, their first impression would be an elite scholar, and then her tragic background, a loving daughter to her parents, someone who excelled in house chores, and stayed true to her heart\u2026</p><br/><p>Having an outburst, Jiang Chao tore his \u201cWind Manga\u201d into a million pieces. His eyes were turning red, just like a crazy person. He kept mumbling to himself, \u201cWhy had it turned out to be this way\u2026 For the first time I have a favorite mangaka, and also this \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 which really touched my heart. When these two happy things came together, a strong feeling of happiness came forth. I was supposed to get the time of my life, living in my dreams\u2026 but, why, why had it turned out to be this way?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

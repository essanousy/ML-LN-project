She was rather frustrated with the writing style of that doujin author, \u201cSetsuna,\u201d it was far beyond compare to the famous web novelist Rosemary, whom she was currently collaborating with. The talented romantic novel writer, Leng Zi would leave this \u201cSetsuna\u201d in the dust. At least Su Li could still imagine the character design, \u201cAltair\u201d through her improvisation.</p><br/><p>Of course, with the help of the referenced character design, \u201cShirotsumekusa\u201d from \u201cDreamside Maroon,\u201d Su Li was able to imagine it, or else she would have a tough time figuring how to even start.</p><br/><p>Even though Su Li was disgruntled with the \u201cDoujin Goddess,\u201d Zhu Yinzhu, she had to admit that her opponent was a genius. She was talented at drawing, composing music and even programming, or else it would be impossible for her to create such a game that fits everyone in the doujin field.</p><br/><p>Under Zhu Yinzhu\u2019s vision, \u201cShirotsumekusa\u201d was a beautiful girl with a long, silver straight hair. She looked so fragile that people would want to protect her with all their might.</p><br/><p>But in \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d doujin, \u201cShirotsumekusa\u201d became a princess with a cool military uniform, named \u201cAltair.\u201d She still had her gentle, princess-like temperament, but besides that, she possessed the will of a soldier who would kill without mercy. She was fearless, and she would have a confident, self-assured smile.</p><br/><p>She seemed to have unlimited powers, named \u201cMovement of Cosmos[1]\u201d, but she would never reveal it in front of other people. She would just watch from the sidelines, like a side character while traveling into different mysterious realms, watching their boring routine like a show.</p><br/><p>She was shrouded in mystery, but when she was no longer mysterious, what kind of surprise would she bring to everyone?</p><br/><p>Nobody would know what happens next. But when they do know about it, they would realize that it would be best not to reveal the mystery.</p><br/><p>Su Li really couldn\u2019t understand what \u201cSetsuna,\u201d wrote on her doujin novel, and she was not interested in it at all, but she was interested in the character design of \u201cAltair.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was a person who had a passion for drawing, so she would have her own standards while drawing, plus she knew Lady Zhao would definitely pay her a good price for drawing \u201cAltair,\u201d so she would draw the illustration of \u201cAltair\u201d with her full effort. Not only had she drawn the \u201cMilitary Uniform Princess\u201d beautifully, she even managed to summon the military temperament out of her, carrying a merciless yet sorrowful expression, while being enshrouded in mystery.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Su Li hoped that she could produce an art piece, because this character itself was already artistic, and seemed sacred yet profane.</p><br/><p>This doujin novel did not seem to have any superpowered elements, it seemed to have the same level of realism as a typical slice of life; there was no fighting in this novel, it was all about the main protagonist roaming freely into any realm she liked.</p><br/><p>If Zhao Youyue is lucky enough to get this character card, she might gain \u201cClairvoyance,\u201d the ability to see the world, roaming in any realm, a remote viewing skill. She would never interrupt others, because she would never know what she was capable of, but she knew that there were no limits to her power!</p><br/><p>A mystery will only give way to higher mysteries!</p><br/><p>But this was apparently an \u201conlooker\u2019s card,\u201d watching everything from a distance\u2026</p><br/><p>Still, it would be impossible for Zhao Youyue to obtain this card, as she was one hundred percent sure that this doujin novel would never get popular. She only hoped that the nameless author would continue writing and not give up, because this work deserved better.</p><br/><p>Even though readers would not like this novel, she who possesses the same ability to enter a literary realm definitely found it an enjoyable experience, to be able to roam freely in any novel world.</p><br/><p>This author had a great imagination, the fantasy worlds that she created never ceased to amaze Zhao Youyue, making her feel like this was the most unforgettable place on earth, and it could possily be the very limits of the human mind.</p><br/><p>The human mind could not just imagine, there was also a theory called \u201cparallel world interference.\u201dThis theory states that, when an author is creating his literary work, those very events were happening in that other world, and would be transferred to the mind of an author in the form of \u201cinspiration,\u201d so the author would write down what he sees.</p><br/><p>This theory was interesting, but nobody could prove that it was right, nor wrong.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue really wanted the ability to write an essay or draw a manga, so that she could turn her traveling experience in the literary work into a novel, and it might get popular.</p><br/><p>If she had the ability to create literary works, she could experiment with herself, to see if she could enter her own work.</p><br/><p>She almost had an idea of what she should do, regarding her next transmigration.</p><br/><p>She started to look for a literary world that could give her the ability to create something creative, something original.</p><br/><p>She was not particularly eager to look for one at the moment, as she enjoyed possessing \u201cAltair,\u201d who had the ability to roam in any world. It made her feel extremely relaxed, and she started smiling more frequently in reality.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Zhao Youyue had stayed in this world that she had dismissed as meaningless, had zero potential and would remain as an unknown doujin.</p><br/><p>What she didn\u2019t know was that, the moment she stays in this literary world, it gave \u201cSetsuna,\u201d who was dying, happiness like she had never experienced before in her final moments of life. It was as if she was walking hand in hand with her creation, traveling through the worlds of fantasy. The pain and suffering in her body suddenly seemed so distant.</p><br/><p>It turns out, that creating something original was such an enjoyable experience, even if nobody would ever know of their shared existence.</p><br/><p>Her happiness had flowed into her writing style as well, reflecting the tranquility of the mysterious, main protagonist.</p><br/><p>On this day, \u201cSetsuna\u201d had just finished updating the latest chapter onto her forum thread, and something surprised her!</p><br/><p>There was a reply on the forum thread, which never happened before, the person replying was called \u201cAltair.\u201d The post also had a remarkable attachment, the illustration of her creation!</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d had never expected to receive an illustration from others, because of her highly unpopular doujin novel.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Movement of Cosmos \u2013 The skill of Altair in the anime, \u201cRe:Creators\u201d. It has a vast variety of skills that she can utilize, including the ability to roam into any dimension and remote viewing. [Reference from Re:Creators wikia] Actually a part of the many abilities of the Holopsicon, but the author here used \u201cMovement of Cosmos\u201d instead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

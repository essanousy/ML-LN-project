However, the score was forfeited, and the girl is now disqualified.</p><br/><p>If so, why is she starting over?</p><br/><p>The heroine, Lin Meiyue was hoping that Gu Yuan would replay the piano too, please do not abandon \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan\u2019s heart was entangled, trying to find a reason. Then, he recalled the moment when \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had pressed her forehead against his, confidently telling him, we can do it!</p><br/><p>Her eyes were full of determination. This was her, a girl who was extremely bold and confident!</p><br/><p>Did she see him to be as brave as her?</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan asked himself.</p><br/><p>Once again, he could hear \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d optimistic and joyful voice revolving around his earsyou still have me, right? Raise your head and look at me! Look at me</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan immediately raised his head, looking at the girl beside him, who was performing solo. Even though she had been disqualified and her performance was meaningless now, she will keep playing as long as there is an audience!</p><br/><p>She was not merely playing for the audiences, but also for the petrified Gu Yuan!</p><br/><p>She wanted to use her music to save him from the chasm!</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan picked himself up, and placed his fingers on the keyboard again!</p><br/><p>The audiences were astonished to hear the unexpected sound of piano</p><br/><p>However, his play still seemed to be unregulated in that judge\u2019s eyes. But, this caused the judger to wonder, what would this once talented pianist do?</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d ignored about the disarray of the pianoforte accompaniment. The smile on her face became brighter, unaffected by the results of the competition. She was happy, because Du Yuan was playing the piano once again under her influence, even though he might still struggling with his psychological trauma</p><br/><p>Focus focus focusGu Yuan was trying his best to focus. The sound and musical notes might have abandoned him during the competition, but as he has read the music score and listened to the song over and over again, he believed that he could unleash what that lay within him!</p><br/><p>When his concentration reached its peak, he could hear his mother\u2019 voice, not berating but gently advising him \u201cListen carefully, Yuan Yuan. You cannot simply play as-is. Treat the piano as yourself, it will smile if you touch it gently, it will get angry if you hit it brutally, you should touch it, like how you caress an infant\u2019s headok, let\u2019s try again, twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are, up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan felt that as if he was under the boundless galaxy, and the stunning night sky was just above him.</p><br/><p>The deepsea drowning sensation seemed to be gradually leaving him.</p><br/><p>He thought to himself; he will play according to his interpretation if he can not hear the sound of the notes, he would allow the music to flow through him, unleashing all that his mother has given him!</p><br/><p>Sweating ferociously, Gu Yuan began to play wildly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he was discontented with his role as an accompanist. He wanted to win over \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d becoming the main character of this competition. Perhaps this was the pride of a once talented musician</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was not an easy girl, becoming more prideful in her music too. She chose to save him by music, but it did not mean she was going to surrender to his music. She was unlike Lin Meiyue!</p><br/><p>If it is Lin Meiyue, she would have chosen to cooperate with him harmoniously, letting him be the main character like he deserved it.</p><br/><p>Arrogance appeared her face. Her thoughts went wild, \u201cFriend A, forget trying to surpass me!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was sweating ferociously too. She drew more power, perfectly handling the bow of her violin.</p><br/><p>On the surface, they seemed to be cooperating, but war had erupted!</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was dumbfounded after seeing their condition. They were releasing the same, inconceivable auras as well as the same degree of stubbornness for music!</p><br/><p>Could this be the so-called connection between geniuses?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, there was a fascinated look on the face of the judge who had high expectations for \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d He thought to himself, is this real, it is so great although they are going wild, having a fight to the death with their instruments</p><br/><p>In fact, their battle was slowly engulfing the audiences!</p><br/><p>All of the audiences were gradually drawn into that artistic conception</p><br/><p>That judge began to realize that, like \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d Gu Yuan was a leading performer too, not an accompanist!</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan felt that he was continuously stimulated by \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d music, like his fierce heartbeat at that moment. With a smile of satisfaction, he glanced at the beautiful figure. He could hear her voice; she was hereIt would be great if she could be with him forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d noticed that he was looking at her, and she too gently smiled. It was a when-you-say-nothing-at-all moment.</p><br/><p>Their performance ended perfectly when they dropped the last note. The audience stirred.</p><br/><p>All of them stood up and applauded vigorously. Some even shouted \u201cBravo,\u201d\u201dGood job,\u201d\u201dthe best,\u201d\u201dEncore\u201d and the sorts. The hall had exploded!</p><br/><p>Perhaps, this is the charm of music</p><br/><p>However, that strict judge was not happy about it, how dare they take so many liberties in a strict, serious, by-the-book competition!</p><br/><p>As he breathed in the dusty, dry, cold air, Gu Yuan looked at his hands. He knew that he back on track. Then, he looked at the audience again, and when he saw how they cheered for the both of them, his eyes sparkled back to life!</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d raised his head, sweat was rolling down her chin. She had used up all of her energy. At that moment, she collapsed</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan could not describe how he felt the moment he saw her fall. She was just an ordinary friend, and Lin Meiyue should be the one he liked the most!</p><br/><p>At that point, the creator, Han Leng, felt most conflicted. He felt a great threat from \u201cChu Luouxun.\u201d Who is supposed to be his heroine? Who had his heart?</p><br/><p>So, Han Leng decided to toss dog food first to allay fears, worried that he would be softhearted and reluctant to let her leave this world</p><br/><p>Otherwise, he would succumb to the charm of \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d That would be awkward!</p>\n</div>"}

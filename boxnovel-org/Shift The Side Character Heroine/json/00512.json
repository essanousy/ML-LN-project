How could Lady Zhao possibly be afraid of real-life, regular dogs?</p><br/><p>No dog would be able to withstand her staff.</p><br/><p>Those so-called \u201cevil dogs\u201d from the gaming world were nothing like their real-life counterparts!</p><br/><p>With that thought, she chose to leave. She had no intention of committing animal abuse in public\u2026</p><br/><p>A few days later, Zhao Youyue received Su Li\u2019s invitation to go to her house to play. After all, it was already late August. Her University would start on September.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s house was in Jiangnan Province. To be precise, it was in a village in a sleepier, slower part of Jiangnan Province. It was not even accessible by highspeed rail. Therefore, Zhao Youyue and Su Li first had to get there by bus. Then, they had to switch to car where paddy fields greeted them from both sides before finally arriving at the village.</p><br/><p>Su Li was most apologetic, mainly because she had not yet learned how to drive. She had often disregarded the necessity of the skill. Modern public transportation was so well-developed that public buses should be able to take people just about anywhere, in big cities at least\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Li had miscalculated. She did not expect going back to her house to be such a complicated matter, mainly because she seldom had to return home since being independent. Her parents were simply too annoying, constantly urging her to leave behind her peaceful bachelorette life. Fortunately, she had become extremely famous within the manga and illustration world. She had an extremely high income which also meant her being financially independent, and was the pillar among her family. Therefore, her elders could not make decisions for her. Ordinary men would feel inadequate. After all, money was the modern age\u2019s lingua franca. She could do anything she wanted with it.</p><br/><p>Su Li found it highly embarrassing to go back home via Lady Zhao\u2019s car. Even if Zhao Youyue had insisted, she would have been too embarrassed to accept the offer. Fortunately, Lady Zhao had been as empathetic as always. She smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m not some sheltered, pampered lady. It\u2019s just a few hours of sitting in a bus. With my phone in hand, time would always fly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li was most touched, seeing how Lady Zhao was willing to put herself through great inconvenience for her sake. Su Li made up her mind to pick up driving and chauffer Lady Zhao herself in the future. It was her only way of making amends.</p><br/><p>The two of them hopped up a big bus. Once again, long-haired Zhao Youyue started drawing in stares like moth to flame. Was that really the case? More than her pretty face, more than her long hair, it was her freaking gem-encrusted walking cane \u2013 or as she called it \u2013 her staff. Ordinary people might dismiss such a staff as fake. The gemstone had to be fake. With the advancement of technology, synthetic products sometimes even surpassed their originators\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, they had it right. That huge, giant gemstone at the top of Zhao Youyue\u2019s staff was indeed a fake. But anything fake in Zhao Youyue\u2019s hands had to be the real thing!</p><br/><p>Take a look at Su Li. Lady Zhao\u2019s sudden interest in staffs was a mystery to her. Nevertheless, all she needed was to look upon the gorgeous staff, and immediately assumed that it had to be extremely valuable. This was just like how players had reacted in \u201cTale of Wuxia 3\u201d. Not once was Jane Doe Su\u2019s \u201cFlying Sword of Myriad Colors\u201d taken as what it was.</p><br/><p>That sword had been nothing but a beautiful ornament. Someone like Jane Doe Su could wield grass and massacre a town if she wanted to, what of a sword?</p><br/><p>If she could turn a blade of grass into a sword, why not wave a cane about!</p><br/><p>Su Li attempted a subtle hint, \u201cMy Lady, people from where I came from are country bumpkins. Are you sure you should be bringing along something so valuable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything valuable. With this, however, everything would be alright.\u201d She held no staff in her hands; it was a sharp, deadly sword.</p><br/><p>Su Li entered the bus with Zhao Youyue and almost immediately started scanning the bus for big, beefy men. She could not help thinking that they might be the legendary bodyguards in plain clothes, protecting Lady Zhao and her valuable staff at all times\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was all alone on this day. She was now highly confident in her capabilities of defending herself. Thanks to \u201cXu Jing card\u2019s\u201d highly reliable learning ability, she could perform a complete series of sword dances, even without her \u201cJane Doe Su card.\u201d Switching on the card would only elevate her abilities into something else entirely. The only problem was the consequential sequel titled, \u201cHer empty, drained body.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Su Li ever learned that Zhao Youyue was without her guards, she would have freaked out. In her mind, Lady Zhao was the perfect rich Lady. Perfect rich ladies got themselves kidnapped all the time. Even her bodyguards had to be as perfect as she was, capable of keeping up with cars on foot. Of course, Lady Zhao would be completely safe at all times.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s imagination was really something\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Lady, I thought you would be difficult to please, with extremely high standards. You are so grand that the world shies away from your glory. I\u2019ve never expected such a day to come, sitting together with you on a bus.\u201d Su Li choked out emotionally. Within her mind, Zhao Youyue was forever elegant and poised. Her standards of living had to be nothing short of perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve been deceived, Sister Li. I\u201dm only pretending to be like a Lady. It\u2019s a trend these days \u2013 adding a character setting to yourself. Only a good actor could get the paparazzi and the spotlight. If not, nobody would spare you a second glance,\u201d Zhao Youyue tinkled through another one of her dazzling smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Lady, you\u2019re just saying that to make me feel good again. I understand. You don\u2019t want to get me lost in guilt. Once we get there, I\u2019ll definitely treat you nicely. My sisters are extremely cute, you\u2019ll see!\u201d said Su Li firmly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue sighed helplessly. She was actually telling the truth. She had a passerby side that Su Li could never fathom. She was a Lady in name, but to others, she was just an ordinary girl \u2014\u2014 She was just too unassuming to be anything more.</p><br/><p>That all changed when she started imitating the \u201cLady characters\u201d within novels and mangas, fulfilling stereotypes to the left and right. Meeting up with business associates such as writers and creators in her limo did not help either. It gave them inspiration and real-life references. \u201cAs expected of a Lady. That\u2019s a real-life Lady, larger than life there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li had no doubts about it. Now that Lady Zhao was walking about with a gemstone staff, all she lacked was a crown on her head!</p><br/><p>All of this was a hoax. The real Zhao Youyue had none of these traits.</p><br/><p>The only genuine part about her was her desire for something.</p><br/><p>If she desired for people to view her as a lady, she could make it happen. If she desired for people to view her as impoverished, she could make it happen. Those character cards that had become a part of her blurred the line between an act and reality.</p><br/><p>As she had predicted, the journey quickly came to pass as she chatted happily with Su Li, while keeping her fingers busy on the screen of her phone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

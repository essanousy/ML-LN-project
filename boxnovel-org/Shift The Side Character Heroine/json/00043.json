{"title": "Chapter 43", "id": 43, "volume": 1, "url": "http://boxnovel.org/shift-the-side-character-heroine-chapter-43", "volume_title": "Volume 1", "body": "<h1>Chapter 43</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<br/><p>If Su Li was still the freshman mangaka when \u201cPure Romance\u201d was yet to gain any fame, her acts of confronting or threatening the editor would totally be in the path of seeking troubles. That could forfeit her future prospect of becoming a prominent mangaka.</p><br/><p>But it was the high time now, as \u201cPure Romance\u201d was gaining all the spotlight. Ever since her personal identity was revealed to the public, the number of her fans had been increasing. Any readers who had a sheer knowledge of the manga world, would definitely know of the sudden entrance of this one beautiful-girl mangaka.</p><br/><p>There was a great solidarity between Su Li\u2019s fans on internet. \u201cPure Romance\u201d had an individual page on Qidian website, in which any new acquirement of silver Sect Master is globally announced, although she could earn only a quarter of the reward. This had given her a notion of publishing her works straight on Qidian main page\u2026</p><br/><p>Even in Zhao Youyue\u2019s class, a student named Jiang Chao had clinched his teeth merely to save up 100 RMB to tip Su Li. This was a huge amount for a student from an average. Anyway, Jiang Chao did it out of his own will, as he liked Su Li and her manga from the bottom of his heart. If Su Li have any new serialization of manga, he would continue supporting her.</p><br/><p>All in all, now Su Li was highly emboldened. Even if she picked up a fight with \u201cWind Manga\u201d, she would not be worried about losing her job. This is what known as a talented and capricious person.</p><br/><p>Moving one step backwards, you would notice that even if she solely continued drawing some books, she could also earn a huge sum. If she announced to the people that Su Li and Wang Li were both the same people, her total book sales would exceed the number you could have imagined.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Wei Suo was simply out of ideas to change Su Li\u2019s perspective. He always thought that Su Li was the kind of mangaka that was bounded by reality. Everything would be revolving around money and popularity, in which she had to treat every reader wholeheartedly, ensuring they could read her creation happily. Since it was a commercialized manga, it had to be delectable and an enjoyable one after reading it. Moreover, he could still remember the way Su Li criticized those hipster mangakas who inflicted bad feelings to the readers a couple of times. How could she possibly become likewise?</p><br/><p>Having said that to create a legend through manga, we had never seen any top enthusiastic manga creating the so-called legend through this method\u2026</p><br/><p>Without any choice, Wei Suo had to bring the bag having the original draft to the chief editor, and also convey Su Li\u2019s determination. Since he could do nothing with Su Li, the chief editor would be the decision maker. Actually, he had not looked into the ending thoroughly, he was just flipping through without pay attention to the tiny details. But he could feel that the ending would be an absolute disappointment to the readers.</p><br/><p>After Wei Suo left, her personal assistant Zhang Ziqiang was looking at Su Li with full respect, and said, \u201cMaster Su Li, you are a genius! But aren\u2019t going a bit too far? Of course, I\u2019m standing by your side about the ending. It\u2019d really make \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 remembered eternally by the readers. The characters in the story will become the legendary characters as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li heaved a sigh. She had felt that she was not in her usual mood. Perhaps she had not recovered from the time when her ideas were bursting in, as well as the feeling of entering the manga world to witness everything by herself. But options were limited and she desperately wanted all her readers to know the real ending of this manga by hook or by crook, instead of simply making up a harmonious ending.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother thing, you had promised the readers on your Weibo that you will come out with a cheerful ending\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this ending cheerful enough? Darkened forms will ruin one\u2019s life and the scumbag guy must die, aren\u2019t these full of positive energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026 you are right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, our collaboration will end here. Let us settle the assistant\u2019s payment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Master Su Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Ziqiang had schemed through the truth. Su Li decided to give her readers \u201cpositive energy\u201d. He felt that if he had the chance to become a serial mangaka, he\u2019d also wanted to learn from someone like Su Li with a positive mind.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the \u201cWind Manga\u201d editing department, Yin Lang the chief editor was deliberately going through the final ending of \u201cPure Romance\u201d. Sitting beside him was the restless Wei Suo. He was afraid when Yin Lang read up to the part of plot twist, he would get outraged and tore up the original draft. In that case, they would have to end their partnership with Su Li\u2026</p><br/><p>Albeit not paying full attention to the original draft, Wei Suo was aware that the ending was any scribblings of Su Li. Instead, she had demonstrated the best of her drawing skills in portraying this final ending. The scenes were so doughty, which was not a good thing, as it could have a tremendous impact on the mind of the readers!</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! This is amusing!\u201d Yin Lang suddenly hit against his working desk and gasped in admiration, \u201cThis kind of badass male protagonist should be tortured to death, this is truly remarkable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Suo was feeling dumbfounded while looking at his very own chief editor. He spoke gently, \u201cBut the main character just died like that, wouldn\u2019t this be fooling the readers? It\u2019s terrible\u2026 and totally doesn\u2019t match the reader\u2019s expectation. Don\u2019t forget Master Su Li\u2019s promise to the readers on Weibo. She had specified that the ending of \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 would be a harmonious one and every character would live happily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Lang frowned a bit while thinking about this matter. But he had no words but continued reading it. Until the last part of ending where the extremely pretty Xu Jing in lily white dress was holding her book and strolling towards the sea, he again hit on his working desk and hollered, \u201cSu Li this fellar was out looking for trouble! Surprisingly, a good girl like Xu Jing didn\u2019t have the chance to live a happy life with Yang Xixi, this is so frustrating!\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing Yin Lang stamping his foot, Wei Suo could not help rolling his eyes. Unexpectedly, the chief editor with bushy eyebrows and big eyes had also abandoned the revolution and went astray. No wonder when he saw the male protagonist, Yang Ming was set to death, he was grinning from ear to ear, just like a kid who weighs 100kg\u2026</p><br/><p>After a while, Yin Lang calmed himself down and sat on his chair, restoring his pride as a chief editor. He adjusted his eyeglasses, then stuck both of his hands to the desk and placed his lower jaw on his hands. With his eyeglasses emitting bare coldness, he slowly said, \u201cI was reading the final ending of \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 using the normal readers\u2019 perspective just now. In all fairness, the male protagonist\u2019s death was really delightful, but the tragedy faced by Xu Jing was too much. However, considering what Xu Jing had done previously, if Xu Jing was let to stay alive, this would show the deviation of moral values, as if we were encouraging the readers to win someone\u2019s heart by fair means or foul. To possess someone by hurting others, this twisted action was totally wrong. The darkened Xu Jing was still pitiful yet detestable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Lang gave his comments about the ending with a steady pace, but Wei Suo was not calm enough. Impatiently, he asked, \u201cChief Editor Yin, should we \u2018Wind Manga\u2019 publish this ending?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

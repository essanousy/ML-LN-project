There had been a severe lack of slow fillers or comedy that would grant viewers a breather.</p><br/><p>The anime\u2019s scriptwriter had not placed any attention on shaping up the female characters. They were mostly characters who shouted \u2018666\u2019 from the sidelines. There was this particular female character, who was one of the male protagonist\u2019s opponent\u2019s sister. She had a zealous form of admiration towards the male protagonist.</p><br/><p>If the kids start to warm up to her to the point that her mere appearance would cause bouts of laughter, she would most certainly have given them a deep impression. Becoming highly popular from thereon would be a cinch.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao had been pretty lucky to have transmigrated into such a popular anime. She would not have to work into making the anime popular. Instead, with some earnest effort, she should turn famous, with the help of the anime\u2019s already present popularity.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue polished up her plans, she entered the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d once again. She chose to possess a primary female student named \u2018Zhou Chun.\u2019 Her pet name within the anime was \u2018Xiao Chun.\u2019 Her father was the manager of a mini 4WD store. She was also the male protagonist, Zhang Haolie\u2019s best friend. She would be the one leading the shouts of \u2018666\u2019 in every race.</p><br/><p>She played mini 4WDs a little. The scriptwriter apparently did not intend to have her take part in the contests of the show. Her characteristics had also been vaguely shaped. However, she still stood out a little; she was probably the cutest among all primary female students in the roster, and was also the male protagonist\u2019s best friend.</p><br/><p>If the viewer demographic had been slightly older, she might have been paired up with the male protagonist; they could even have ended up as the poster couple. However, kids would not look into things that deeply. They would be satisfied just by watching the male protagonist having reversal wins, one after another. His fans would not be able to help but buy his \u2018The Last Saber\u2019 and have a share of his power.</p><br/><p>The moment Zhao Youyue possessed her, she realized that this character would easily gain popularity by getting slightly more involved in the events of the anime. After that, she would be able to leave the literary world without any lingering side-effects. She was certain that this trip would be rather relaxing.</p><br/><p>She would not be satisfied with just becoming a popular character. She would settle for not less than a \u2018high popularity character card,\u2019 so that she could freely choose her next story verse.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue possessed the character, she started tweaking her settings. She took note of the \u2018passionate in sports\u2019 attribute. It was a pretty neat attribute, as she was rather laidback in reality. Being laidback was not good for her body. It would always be beneficial to love sports and exercise with a passion.</p><br/><p>Next, she added a new ability. The ability to design gorgeous shapes and appearances for mini 4WDs. But due to the overemphasis of aesthetics, her mini 4WDs would end up useless. She would always end up last among all those who finish. Some players would never be able to finish the race, with some breaking down halfway, some being destroyed by the villain\u2019s \u2018The Destruction Corps.\u2019</p><br/><p>Her originally vague personality grew more detailed as well. She knew that her own mini 4WDs were ridiculously slow, all of them were flashy, yet useless. Yet, she would have the knack of blowing hot air to the point that her mini 4WDs would sound like Gods. Each and every ultimate skill name she utters would be downright intimidating!</p><br/><p>However, the moment those \u2018scary\u2019 ultimate skills are unleashed, the scene would turn downright comedic. Would the kids enjoy watching such a turn of events, and remember it for a long time?</p><br/><p>The answer would obviously be, yes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Chun had now become a classic case of an \u2018Idiot Girl\u2019 with an \u2018inexplicable sense of self-confidence.\u2019 She would be the ultimate show off and drama queen. Yet, every time, she would end up \u2018slapping her own face.\u2019 Her silly antics would only add on to her cuteness. She shouldn\u2019t be called Xiao Chun, but Little Silly instead</p><br/><p>There was another unique quirk about Xiao Chun. The other mini 4WD players only had one mini 4WD each, including the male protagonist. Yet, Xiao Chun would have an endless array of them, as if she was a mini 4WD collector. All her mini 4WDs would be more decorative than functional. In the end, by perhaps being too attractive, her mini 4WDs would always be targeted and whisked off in the jaws of a naughty husky</p><br/><p>After possessing \u2018Xiao Chun,\u2019 Zhao Youyue immediately took action. Xiao Chun suddenly declared to her dad that she intended to become a mini 4WD player.</p><br/><p>The moment she said that, something miraculous happened. An additional default setting appeared on her body, \u2018Max Stamina.\u2019 It had been completely out of her hands. She was even worried that the scriptwriter would remove such an outrageous trait.</p><br/><p>However, after careful consideration, she realized that all mini 4WD players would have this by default. Not just max stamina, players would be able to run as fast as their mini 4WDs. Even helicopters would not be able to catch up to their speed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was a little surprised about this. She originally thought that a highly popular character card from this anime would only be gain mini 4WD design-related traits. Such abilities would be useless in reality. She was not going to venture into mini 4WD sales anytime soon.</p><br/><p>Ever since she learned of \u2018Max Stamina\u2019 and \u2018having a running speed comparable to mini 4WDs\u2019, this character card might have its uses, afterall!</p><br/><p>Xiao Chun\u2019s dad had no objections to her decision. He even handed her a mini 4WD. Of course, it could not be compared to the male protagonist\u2019s mini 4WD. The mini 4WDs of the male protagonist and popular characters had all been heavily modified. They were all one-of-a-kind in the entire world. Xiao Chun\u2019s mini 4WD was a mass-produced one.</p><br/><p>Xiao Chun did not mind it at all. She did not consider common mini 4WDs disgusting, other than the appearance. She expressed naively to her dad that the true strength of mini 4WDs lay in its beauty. Therefore, as long as she manages to design the most gorgeous shell ever, her mini 4WD would undergo metamorphosis!</p><br/><p>Xiao Chun\u2019s dad did not even know that Xiao Chun had such drawing skills. Even though this was something as trivial as the drawing of mini 4WD\u2019s shell, he found it to be an incredible discovery. After all, she was just a primary student!</p><br/><p>A mini 4WD\u2019s shell would actually affect its speed. For example, the male protagonist\u2019s mini 4WD had a perfectly streamlined body. Aerodynamics played a very real part in such variables. However, the shell that Xiao Chun drew for her own mini 4WD did not take such things into consideration. She applied the shape of the cars from another world into the mini 4WD world!</p><br/><p>Since it was just a shell, producing it was a rather simple process. Xiao Chun proudly brought her self-designed, gorgeous mini 4WD along and met up with the male protagonist.</p><br/><p>Zhang Haolie greatly supported Xiao Chun\u2019s decision to become a mini 4WD player. When he saw her self-designed gorgeous mini 4WD, he was instantly overwhelmed with excitement. His morale had been ignited. He wanted to race against Xiao Chun.</p><br/><p>With inexplicable self-confidence, Xiao Chun told Zhang Haolie that she had developed an ultimate skill for her mini 4WD!</p><br/><p>In order to enhance the effect, she had given it an English name \u2014\u2014 Angry Crow Takes Flight!</p><br/><p>Zhang Haolie had a good grasp of the English language, and was even more eager to take on her mini 4WD\u2019s ultimate skill \u2014\u2014 Angry Crow Takes Flight!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

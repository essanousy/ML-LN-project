She remembered her lofty and bossy mother shouting, \u201cI would rather eat this book in my hand than take a bite of this little sloth\u2019s cooking\u201d. Soon after, the table had been served with Sauteed Shredded Pork with Green Pepper, Fried Egg with Tomato, Sauteed Chinese Greens with Mushrooms, Braised Eggplant Slices, Kung Pao Chicken, Braised Pork, Borsch, and Etc\u2026 They smelled great, and looked wonderful. One wouldn\u2019t need to taste to know that they were wonderful dishes.</p><br/><p>For someone like Zhao Jiayi and Wang Hua who have gotten used to deluxe meals, these simple, sentimental homemade dishes appealed to them more than usual. Everyone had been engaged in rather strenuous physical activities a while ago, and it was already time for dinner. The hunger caused a sudden surge in their appetite\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Hua\u2019s face blushed, appearing more beautiful and adorable. Besides the frequent twin ponytails that she had during her school days, she now maintained straight and soft long black hair, resembling the style of a goddess. In the entire Jiangnan University, she was actually a very well-known professor, thanks to that beauty. It was a pity that she was already a wifey now, that is truly disappointing.</p><br/><p>Of course, to some people, having the wife attribute might actually be more alluring.</p><br/><p>The truth was that Wang Hua really felt like filling a bowl of rice and start eating straight away. However, she felt uncomfortable under her daughter\u2019s thorough gaze. With a deep breath, she showed her majesty of a mother, using the bossy tone of a missy as before, \u201cLittle sloth, what are you staring at? Don\u2019t you know how to show some respect to daddy and mommy by serving us some rice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue pursed her lips and smiled mildly, and filled two bowls of rice with seeming obedience. The bowl with more rice was handed over to her father. For the one with less rice, just as she placed it in front of her mother, she pulled it back the next moment. Then, while her mother stared with her jaw dropped, she brought the thick famous work of Redology and placed it in front of her mother\u2019s face. With a tender voice, \u201cI think that a literature maiden who swallows books is pretty Moe, old mama. The taste of the books should be a lot tastier than my cooking. Please enjoy.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Wang Hua had better insight, she would have noticed. Compared to the Zhao Youyue who was cooking, the current Zhao Youyue had changed the way of addressing her mother. In future, there might even be more different forms of Zhao Youyue. Then, she could have gotten an inspiration to write an interesting novel named \u201cMy Frequently Possessed Daughter\u201d or \u201cI Might Have Given Birth to A Fake Daughter\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Wang Hua was left speechless by this naughty little sloth. Her blushing red face blushed even further, given her history of teasing Zhao Youyue without holding back. What surprised her was that her daughter really cooked a tableful of a feast. The appearance and fragrant was all good, and most probably it should taste good too. But now, this little sloth wanted her to swallow the book!</p><br/><p>Wang Hua stroked the table and stood up angrily, \u201cI don\u2019t have such a daughter like you. That\u2019s right, how would a diligent genius such as myself give birth to such a plain little sloth! From now on, there will only be either you or me in this house! And don\u2019t call me old mama!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt her scalp tingling from her mother\u2019s words and stuck out her tongue innocently. Although her mother had already used similar words countless of times, she still had a hint of fear from it every time her mother shouts out. Zhao Youyue did not dare to challenge her mother further and quickly looked over to her father, showing the \u201ccrying for help\u201d look.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi showed a bitter smile, and then he took the initiative to fill a bowl of rice for Wang Hua. He could always fill the perfect amount that could be finished by Wang Hua. This seemed like he had already gotten used to serving his wife, the missy with the worst temper in the house. But then, he was willing to make this sacrifice, perhaps this was called love.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, in the eyes of Zhao Youyue, this was a sickening pair of spoilt parents. It was so disgusting that she hoped that she did not have to see. She did not know what other families were like, but she felt that the family she was born in was a weird one. Her father was still normal, but her mother was\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue always criticized her mother in her heart as a retard in daily life. Her narcissism was far beyond help, and the missy temper was more like a child. She looked less than 30 years old, very pretty, had a mature charm and her visibility and glamour was far higher than Zhao Youyue. The truth was that she was actually already an obasan[1], but still continued to pretend. Also, she always carried some unfathomable literature books to show off, wanting Zhao Youyue to learn from her. Not to know that Zhao Youyue actually knew her mother secretly watched the romantic drama from Korea and Japan with high interest. Besides, she laughed like a fool when she watched Bilibili Kichiku All-Stars[2]. Recently, she was also addicted to the \u201cCan\u2019t leave you\u201d by \u201cBrother Bo Lan\u201d the junk man.</p><br/><p>Certainly, Zhao Youyue would never dare to speak her thoughts out, fearing that old mama would tie her up and beat her like a pinata. But wasn\u2019t this the truth? Seeing that old mama looked down on her earlier, if she was not under \u201cXu Jing\u2019s possession\u201d mode that moment, she would have quarreled with her mom. How frustrating it was, she was trying to show some filial to this spoilt couple, just to receive the old mama\u2019s cynicism.</p><br/><p>Under Zhao Jiayi\u2019s meaningful gaze, Wang Hua who was almost a feral cat about to lash out, finally simmered down. She got more hungry and could not wait to start eating. First, she used a spoon to take a sip of the Borsch. Her face revealed a captivated expression, how could this Borsch taste so good!</p><br/><p>Was it because the Borsch was filled with her daughter\u2019s sincerity?</p><br/><p>Wang Hua took a few more sips, feeling an unspeakable warmth. She closed her eyes, as if she had risen to the heavens!</p><br/><p>What a touch to the heart. It was as if she was in the midst of despair but still had her daughter accompanying by her, protecting her quietly, and sharing the familial burdens with her\u2026 What a good girl!</p><br/><p>Wait, where did her family pressure come from?</p><br/><p>After all, Wang Hua was a litterateur, filled with perceptual. Surprisingly, she could feel Xu Jing\u2019s love to her mother from the soup. It was indeed quite fantasized, but when she opened her eyes and saw a ponytailed little sloth puffing her cheeks gazed at her intriguingly, immediately she dismissed that illusion. Nevertheless, she showed an arrogant missy attitude, evaluated with a weak voice, \u201cNot bad for this soup!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue covered her mouth, trying hard to gulp back the laughter, while Zhao Jiayi started to gulp on the food. His table manners were not rude at all, instead, there was a kind of elegance of nobility. Still, his speed in eating was quite swift\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing her daughter\u2019s reaction, Wang Hua\u2019s face turned blushing red again, lying brazenly, \u201cMmmhmm, isn\u2019t this thanks to my participation in the dinner preparation? Sure enough, I\u2019m much more talented than this little sloth, even in culinary skills. There is still a long way for you to catch up to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld mama, if you don\u2019t eat faster, daddy is already going to finish everything off.\u201d Zhao Youyue rolled her eyes, moved her chopsticks swiftly while reminding her mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! You scoundrel from the Zhao family! Slow down, don\u2019t snatch all my dinner made with love from my little sloth! And, don\u2019t call me \u2018old mama\u2019!\u201d Yelled Wang Hua to the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just too yummy! I can\u2019t stop myself!\u201d Zhao Jiayi replied with a satisfactory smile. At the same time, he did not forget to serve his wife and daughter with some dishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAww aww\u2026 Smells so good!\u201d Wang Hua\u2019s face was full of happiness too.</p><br/><p>This was probably the most unforgettable and delicious dinner in their entire life.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u2013 Obasan</p><br/><p>Derived from a Japanese word \u304a\u3070\u3055\u3093, means \u201caunty\u201d or \u201cold lady\u201d, commonly used in Chinese nowadays to describe an old lady.</p><br/><p>[2] B \u2013 Bilibili Kichiku.</p><br/><p>\u2013 B \u2013  \u2013 Bilibili [website] (www.bilibili.com)</p><br/><p>A video sharing website.

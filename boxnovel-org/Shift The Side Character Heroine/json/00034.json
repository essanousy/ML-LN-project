Su Li was literally gasping while drawing this pair of seductive lips. She felt a prickle of excitement, as if her real self was within the manga world, witnessing this first intimate contact between Xu Jing and Yang Xixi in proximity.</p><br/><p>Of course, the dark and serene eyes of Xu Jing was granted a close-up as well. She was gazing at Yang Xixi affectionately. When Yang Xixi questioned about her type of guy, she did not speak of a word but kissed her immediately and their bodies were then huddled together.</p><br/><p>After a short kiss, Xu Jing pulled back her lips from Yang Xixi\u2019s. She then turned over and lay right above Yang Xixi\u2019s body. So soft and delicate. Her two hands were resting on Yang Xixi\u2019s shoulders. This posture akin to a Kabe-don[1] was also helping to support her upper body. She continued to look into the eyes of the dumbfounded Yang Xixi\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, the entire room was bathed in dazzling moonlight and it was quite a breathtaking view. The rapid breathing of Xu Jing could be heard clearly in this peaceful night.</p><br/><p>The body-touching scenes depicted by Su Li had always been provocative, and had very much aroused the readers. In contrast, Yuri\u2019s scene between Xu Jing and Yang Xixi was considered quite impeccable. It was a piece of art that elated all the readers and was indeed a visual splendour!</p><br/><p>Xu Jing\u2019s face was rather blushed right now. She was no longer the Tri-no girl without words, heart, and expressions. Her world was so full of Yang Xixi and could not take in anyone else.</p><br/><p>It was still the manga scenes with the close-ups of Xu Jing\u2019s dark and serene eyes. It seemed that the exquisite face of Yang Xixi had utterly captivated Xu Jing\u2019s pair of eyes. Astonished, Yang Xixi asked in confusion, \u201cXiao\u2026 Xiao Jing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nervous?\u201d Xu Jing responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. For sure I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Covering her reddened face, Yang Xixi answered, \u201cBecause Xiao Jing, is my friend\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing such words, an ambivalent feeling flickered within her eyes. But it was instantly substituted by an adamance. Xu Jing pushed away Yang Xixi\u2019s hand right before her face. Leaning down, once again she kissed her vigorously. This time when their lips were separated, she questioned, \u201cThough you\u2019re doing this with me, you still can\u2019t forget about your brother right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the word \u2018brother\u2019 rang in her ears, Yang Xixi\u2019s eyes were brimming with tears. After all, the person she loved the most was still her brother! (This is the setting of \u201cPure Romance\u201d. In the manga, Yang Xixi was the girl who loved Yang Ming the most. But the world of manga is different from reality, in which people could change themselves by giving up their loved ones, and continuing to look for their right ones. The characters in the world of manga have to adhere to\u2026 settings)</p><br/><p>Looking at Yang Xixi who was about to cry, she grieved inside her heart, \u201cXixi, she is crying, I\u2019ve made her cry. I can\u2019t bear the sight of Xixi being so sad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The deadpan face of Xu Jing was permeated with sorrow. She said, \u201cJust tell me if you don\u2019t want it, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 I like Xiao Jing.\u201d Yang Xixi spoke softly.</p><br/><p>Xu Jing was back to her deadpan face again. Her eyes were becoming more and more sombre now. She knew that Yang Xixi merely liked her as a friend. It\u2019s just that she was still someone special inside Yang Xixi\u2019s heart. Besides, Yang Xixi could not afford to lose her and thus she did not turn her down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t win your heart, let me have the warmth of your body at least.\u201d Xu Jing thought to herself with a broken heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSatisfy me, can you?\u201d Xu Jing whispered in Yang Xixi\u2019s ears, and then bit her earlobe.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>While Xu Jing was doing such inexplicable things to her, Yang Xixi was still thinking about her brother. In any way, she failed to let go of her love towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXixi, how do you want it? Say it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Don\u2019t\u2026 Uhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr let\u2019s drop it? Since you\u2019re not saying a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it seems like you cannot resist this sensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not! It\u2019s just\u2026 the way Xiao Jing touches me\u2026 I feel comfortable, and so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm. It\u2019s because I love Xixi. I\u2019m touching someone I love. So you will feel comfortable. Because this is love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Jing stopped her baffling motions for a moment. Instead, she hugged Yang Xixi gently yet tightly, and buried her head into Xixi\u2019s breasts, just as she was protecting the most precious treasure in her life. In a sense, the duo were quite alike. Even if her brother had become a scumbag, Yang Xixi would not stop loving him. She would continue to love him, believing that her brother was just temporarily mesmerized by this filthy girl and she would always be the most perfect sister of her brother!</p><br/><p>Similarly, Xu Jing would never let go of Yang Xixi. Though she might be treated by Yang Xixi as a substitute for her brother, and someday\u2026 Yang Xixi would walk away from Xu Jing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warmth and kindness given by a man are limited. I\u2019m aware of this theory, but still, I\u2019ve derived so much pleasure from Xiao Jing\u2019s body. In the end, I would probably arrive at a frigid island. All alone.\u201d Yang Xixi imagined.</p><br/><p>In fact, the manga scenes in which her nude body intertwined with Xu Jing\u2019s, had demonstrated a pinnacle of beauty. After all, they were both first-class beauties.</p><br/><p>In her illusion, she was holding an umbrella alone in a cold rain, while walking along an empty street. She seemed to hear someone whispering in her ears, \u201cSigh, you can never be friends with Xiao Jing anymore. It\u2019s your fault, you knew that. Today, it\u2019s your first time making use of someone\u2019s affection for yourself. There\u2019s no difference between you and the girl who snatched your brother, you\u2019re both b*tches. Congrats! Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you like someone like me? Xiao Jing, I don\u2019t understand. Forgive me, I have no words\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Xixi. I don\u2019t expect you to, and you don\u2019t have to understand. I can do everything for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be \u2018alright\u2019? But, I just can\u2019t stop myself. I\u2019m so clingy to your tenderness, and had treat it as a substitute for my brother\u2019s. Ah, sure enough, I\u2019m also a scumbag.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou pity me?\u201d A grudging smile flickered within that sombre eyes of Xu Jing.</p><br/><p>Yang Xixi, \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust kidding. I ask for nothing more.\u201d Once again, Xu Jing cuddled her.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Whenever the mangaka Su Li was drawing the Yuri plots of Xu Jing and Yang Xixi, she would be overwhelmed with a miraculous feeling. Heat would be flowing throughout her body. She could not help thinking that, if there is such a girl like Xu Jing in reality, no matter what happens, she would go any lengths to protect her. Never would she become like Yang Xixi, who only took her as her \u201ctemporary brother\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, if this continues, how am I supposed to portray a happy ending for \u201cPure Romance?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li relished watching her best-loved artworks in tremendous satisfaction. Meanwhile, she had gotten goosebumps\u2026 \u201cAh whatever, should the readers have a taste of my goosebumps too. Behold my zeal for arts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Up to this point, would she still care about the readers\u2019 feelings?</p><br/><p>Her paintbrush was already outta control!</p><br/><p>No matter what, she was determined to carry on this drawing path, solely for her beloved \u201cXu Jing\u201d.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cKabe-don\u201d is a buzzword in Japanese Shoujo manga. \u201cKabe\u201d means wall; \u201cDon\u201d is the thud of someone hitting it. It is a flirtatious posture in which a guy slams his hand against the wall, pinning a girl against it. The Kabe-don moment is one of the most Moe moments for girl readers. The proximity between the girl and guy is so short that it can get her heart to go doki doki. The guy is usually doing it out of an intense emotion such as jealousy or anger, but sometimes it is merely flirtatious.</p>\n</div>"}

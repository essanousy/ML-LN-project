He had still ended up better than Ding Yuncong; even if his ending was no less unpleasant. In the eyes of netizens, no matter what he did, he was just another helpless wealthy kid. Nothing more than a snob.</p><br/><p>This incident had dramatically annoyed Zhao Hao. How had things ended up with him trying to play a part in his cousin-sister\u2019s stage</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was notably calm about this whole incident, despite being the main character of the headline. She had nothing to hide, nor had she committed any wrongs. No matter how people attempted to twist the story, they could not find any valid angle of attack. A total waste of effort!</p><br/><p>The masses interpreted Zhao Youyue\u2019s calmness as the result of her fearless heart. This only added on to the credibility of her strong background support, even sealing the mouths of those who habitually started rumors. Having the police knock on your doors would not be a laughing matter.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue displaced herself from the incident. She surveyed the unabridged waves of gossips involving Ah Yu, which had all started off with her being in Ding Yuncong\u2019s supercar. She had thought she was bound to lose her fanbase. Never had she thought to not only ward off the gossips, but her fans had also increased in numbers and were more loyal than ever. Zhao Youyue being an actual upper-class lady was a rather astonishing revelation.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue scrolled through her Weibo leisurely. Most of the comments were from her worshippers. They praised Lady Ah Yu for managing to take prominent characters such as Ding Yuncong under her wings. It was all too awe-inspiring!</p><br/><p>Ah Yu was not particularly famous at the moment. She was not in the entertainment circle, after all. Therefore, not many people would want to condemn her. They could fabricate any evil plotlines from within the shadows, even if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue recovered her previous, adorable look, complemented by her bob cut hairstyle. The sense of familiarity as a quiet passerby returned to her.</p><br/><p>This became a reason for her to once again conceal herself from the eyes of the camera on her upcoming broadcast. No matter what happens, she would never turn on the camera.</p><br/><p>Most of her audience were left disappointed. After all, they came to watch her beautiful face. They could not understand why Lady Ah Yu had refused to show her face once again.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue adeptly deflected the protest, claiming her family members had forbidden her from doing so.</p><br/><p>With this excuse, fans began to make use of their rationale. Rumors had it that Ah Yu hailed from a mysterious hidden family that had its fist wrapped around the hearts of nations. Ah Yu popping up on streaming networks would only make such a family look bad.</p><br/><p>Everybody expressed their understandings of Ah Yu\u2019s situation. Her broadcasts were still entertaining, even without her face. It was how it all began, was it not? It was just like the days of old, when everyone had presumed Ah Yu to be an ugly swan!</p><br/><p>The power of imagination was truly astounding. They believed that Ah Yu was an actual elite, the world-ruling type. The truth could not be any further away. To be precise, the Zhao family was a deteriorating, second-rate upper-class family.</p><br/><p>The actual elites would find such an idea hilariously entertaining.</p><br/><p>Despite that, Zhao Youyue\u2019s family was indeed capable of providing her with a luxurious life for the rest of her days. Perhaps what she had was beyond the fruits of another\u2019s entire life.</p><br/><p>Her decision of turning off camera impacted her reputation. Her inconsistent streams only made things worse. Even though her popularity embarked on its descent, she still received numerous gifts from the Gods of tycoons. Tian Shenluo was one of those who randomly fired rockets off to illustrate his presence.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue no longer placed much stock in broadcasting. She had started her own publishing company. Even though it was small, it had everything. Her company debuted with Shih Jingnian\u2019s \u201cBakuman.\u201d It was not enough, so it was all up to Zhao Youyue to find more authors of exceptional quality.</p><br/><p>Shih Jingnian had indeed earned Zhao Youyue a large sum of money with his talent in writing. Zhao Youyue appreciated talent very much. She decided to visit a recuperating Shih Jingnian who still remained in her family\u2019s hospital.</p><br/><p>The chimerical power of the short-haired Zhao Youyue took effect, almost immediately!</p><br/><p>Back when she still had long hair, Shih Jingnian\u2019s beautiful girl radar often went bonkers whenever she walked into his room. Even though Shih Jingnian was no longer as he was, he would flirt with her in every way he knew. It was a declaration of his will to stay alive.</p><br/><p>On more than one occasion, Zhao Youyue had sought to greet his cheeks with an open palm. Could he not get acquainted with silence, for even one moment?</p><br/><p>It was the first time Zhao Youyue had walked into Shih Jingnian\u2019s room with her short hair. He was reading his book. He threw a glance at her direction, then went back to reading. Short-haired Zhao Youyue was a complete stranger to him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue walked to his side. Shih Jingnian spoke coldly, \u201cSorry, you are in the wrong room, I do not know you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was exactly what Zhao Youyue desired. She smiled and said \u201cBut I do know you. You are the great author! I\u2019m your fan, could you sign here for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA fan, you say? There are no fans here, why I could not see one? Please don\u2019t be so thick-skinned. You, an absolute nobody, dare claim yourself as my fan? I only have pretty fans, and you do not qualify as one.\u201d said Shih Jingnian sternly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are such a debauchee! I\u2019m truly sorry about my insignificant presence,\u201d Zhao Youyue replied just as bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my true nature; I never intended to cover it. Don\u2019t blame me for not respecting you. I would only bow to the flawless beautiful long hair Lady Zhao, not a short hair forgery. To be honest, your short hair looks really ugly.\u201d Shih Jingnian was not joking.</p><br/><p>Her short haircut infuriated him. She had ruined herself! Every girl on earth hoped to make themselves looked prettier and more compelling. Why would Zhao Youyue transform herself into some ordinary passerby?</p><br/><p>Shih Jingnian did recognize Zhao Youyue, but he disapproved of her current appearance. She was not the Lady Zhao that he knew by heart.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he had no qualms denouncing her. It was his style. Ordinary girls had no chance of getting near this alpha debauchee.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the real me,\u201d Zhao Youyue professed. This was her base form, unassuming and low-key.</p><br/><p>She knew that she could easily acquire Shih Jingnian\u2019s approval by activating her \u201cWen Qingyu\u201d card, but she did not bother to do so.</p><br/><p>She looked at Shih Jingnian, picked her feet up and left the scene.</p><br/><p>The summer holidays have ended. Zhao Youyue officially started off her final year as a high school senior. It was the toughest year in high school, while also being the most comfortable.</p><br/><p>All the basics in high school had been imparted in years one and two. The final year sought to revise and enhance that already-present knowledge.</p><br/><p>It was tough because of tight schedules and ceaseless homework. It was comfortable for Zhao Youyue, as she was the ultimate student who had mastered the basics.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue procured \u201cXu Jing\u2019s\u201d character card, she no longer worried about her studies. She had perfect recall, and perfect comprehension. Revision was just another pointless, meaningless past time for her.</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue stepped into the school garden with her short hair, most students were left distraught</p><br/><p>Where has our school flower gone to?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

For every following day, she would only play for two hours at most, so that \u201cXiao Yu\u201d could enjoy herself in the world of gaming.</p><br/><p>She did not only play \u201cLoL\u201d on her livestream, she played many single player games too. As Xiao Yu steamrolled through the games, Zhao Youyue felt her gaming standard improving slowly as well.</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhao Youyue had no idea how to make herself famous, because she did not know how to insert any gimmicks into her show. If she decided to give out 1000 QQ coins whenever her champion Yasuo loses in a solo battle, she might get more attention.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was just simply live streaming herself playing games casually, relaxing and minding her own business.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had already gained a few subscriptions on her first stream, but they had just come here to insult the streamer on the bullet curtain. Obviously, they were fans of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d in the novel, they simply could not ignore it when someone self-proclaims herself as Yu Shengfan in the flesh, and they also wanted to see the face of this \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue only lashed out at them furiously, because with her \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card\u201d active, she was now a loud-mouthed venomous brat with a tongue of spears</p><br/><p>\u201cStop making noises and look at how I play seriously, learn from this king\u2019s skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how many of you are watching me, I only care about my enjoyment. If you think that you guys are tough when commenting on the bullet curtain, watch me insult each and every one of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any presents, a rich lady like me doesn\u2019t lack money!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease roll out of this live streaming room!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you guys comment something nice on the bullet curtain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this how you put up a fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, it was quite difficult to become famous because of how Zhao Youyue or rather, Yu Shengfan performed in her live streaming video. She was far from friendly to her audiences, whereas other streamers would treat their audiences like treasured guests, asking presents from them politely. They would even treat those high leveled tycoon fans like their own parents, wishing they would give out presents like rockets or airplanes.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, on the other hand, did not even bother about these tycoon fans. Those normal audiences who only commented on the bullet curtain had it far worst.</p><br/><p>Every time Zhao Youyue starts a live streaming, it becomes a battleground between her and the people in bullet curtain, insulting each other. Her teammates and opponent had something to win from it as her attention would be diverted, so she would no longer be flinging insults at her opponents in the game.</p><br/><p>It was rather spectacular in its own way with so many people in the bullet curtain coming in to look for a fight.</p><br/><p>The main point was, Zhao Youyue or Yu Shengfan would never utter a single cuss word while scolding everyone, or else her room would have been banned by now.</p><br/><p>She would render everyone in the bullet curtain speechless. Under those circumstances, she used three days to win ten rounds of ranking battles, with a win rate of 100 percent, becoming a gold rank player. This was quite an impressive feat for a new player.</p><br/><p>What that really fed her fame was the way she fused those insulting words together while playing on a live streaming video. She would scold the audiences while playing the game, it was certainly an enjoyable experience. Some people were here to watch her extraordinary gaming skill, some people were here looking for a fight!</p><br/><p>Whenever Zhao Youyue uses \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card\u201d, her original, soothing voice would change into the voice of a lolita, similar to that of Rie Kugimiya. \u201cWas this actually the \u201cFanfan\u2019s disease\u201d in real life?\u201d many viewers wondered.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue unusual style had attracted many perverted fans in a short period of time, they all wished to get scolded by Zhao Youyue. The more Zhao Youyue insults them, the better the reward!</p><br/><p>Many audiences soon realized that if the two dimensional character, Yu Shengfan comes into reality, this might actually be her method of live-streaming!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, \u201cLoL\u201d did not have chat bubbles, and people could mute their chat at will. When Zhao Youyue goes off with her \u201cChat flow\u201d ability at the start of a game, she soon realized her opponents had muted her and feared her \u201cChat flow\u201d would become useless. She could not hold back the urge to talk while she eats them for breakfast, but then she found out there were many insulting comments on the bullet curtain! She was so happy, as if she had discovered a new continent!</p><br/><p>It was the true nature of Yu Shengfan to insult her audiences while she is playing a game, because she was a tsundere ojou-sama. Besides Lin Feng, nobody would ever be spared from her venomous tongue!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s live stream had become famous, but her reputation was not doing as well. Everyone knew that a certain little girl plays \u201cLoL\u201d with a bad attitude, scolding the audience while playing. She would have the audience beg her if the audience ever wants her to use a specific champion, or else she would never agree to it.</p><br/><p>There was now a few thousand people watching Zhao Youyue live streaming every night, and she already had more than twenty thousand subscriptions. Everyone knew that the popularity of this particular Douyu Streamer was still relatively low, only because she was a female game streamer who had joined in only recently.</p><br/><p>Nobody would dare to question about Zhao Youyue self-proclaiming herself as \u201cDouyu Yu Shengfan\u201d anymore, because she already proved herself with her venomous tongue that was similar to Yu Shengfan, now she only needed to prove her gaming skills.</p><br/><p>Of course, many audiences did not expect much from her, because she never reveals her face. According to her voice, everyone thought that she was only an elementary student, and there was no way that a female elementary student could play that well.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue kept amassing victories in the ranking battles while verbally abusing the audiences. As time passed, her fame as \u201cDouyu\u2019s Yu Shengfan\u201d soon spread out.</p><br/><p>The creator of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, Ye Hai would watch a live-stream or two in his leisure time. With the currently advanced technology of live-streaming, he could learn a gaming technique or two from it.</p><br/><p>Soon, he heard a news from his readers\u201dMy goodness, Xiao Yu had started a live streaming video in our reality, will she exact her vengeance on our Master Rosemary?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hai was curious about it, as he loved the character Yu Shengfan as well, and soon navigated his was into the live-streaming room of Yu Shengfan. The first thing he heard was Yu Shengfan scolding, \u201cFilthy bugs, crawl out my channel immediately! The one that keeps giving gifts, yes you! Are you stupid, I\u2019m scolding you right now, and you\u2019re still giving me gifts?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ye Hai heard the voice of Yu Shengfan, he was dumbfounded. This voice, there was no mistake!</p><br/><p>You might not believe it, but this is \u2018the\u2019 voice. It was the very voice that had rattled his brains in his \u201cintoxicated state\u201d!</p>\n</div>"}

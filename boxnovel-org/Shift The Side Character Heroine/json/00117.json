No clear winner was in sight.</p><br/><p>The foreshadowing of this battle had the power to send the readers into a mindset prepared for the worst, filled with that hollow, sinking despair!</p><br/><p>The setting of the scene reeled the readers in, sending chills all around their bodies. The blood rushed through their very souls, placing them in the front row seats of the scenes themselves!</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, such powerful contents, capable of getting readers \u201cintoxicated,\u201d was the complete embodiment of Rosemary\u2019s writing strength!</p><br/><p>Lin Feng did not know that Little Fish\u2019s body was on the verge of collapsing on the other side of the screen. However, as the best in Eternal solo fights, he will never show mercy. Actually, Lin Feng, who now possessed the golden finger was much stronger in one-on-one, compared to the time when he was crowned as the champion in countless solo championship matches!</p><br/><p>By the sheer amount of experience this elder, wiser him had amassed, the younger him could never have matched his skills right now. His reflexes and abilities have been so vastly amplified by the golden finger to an extent that would leave his younger self in the dust. So to speak, he was now the perfect player. He had the experience and tricks of an old player while retaining the speed of a young player!</p><br/><p>Even so, his speed could not match Little Fish who was drug-addled and had max gaming talents\u2026</p><br/><p>Yet, this was Lin Feng, the final boss of Eternal War throughout its history, the unmatched among the unmatched. Unbelievably, such a protagonist would nearly have his glory stolen by a newbie player, Yu Shengfan as Rosemary\u2019s writings would deem so. After blowing up Lin Feng to such proportions, the strength of a drug-addled and talent-riddled Yu Shengfan only spoke volumes of itself!</p><br/><p>Even Rosemary himself could feel his adrenaline pumping wildly as he wrote furiously about the battle taking place between these two epic characters!</p><br/><p>It was just intoxicating!</p><br/><p>Although it was a rather dramatic change, Ye Hai knew that he had not destroyed Yu Shengfan\u2019s image. He had retained the peak of Yu Shengfan\u2019s honor and glory in the middle-phase of this novel!</p><br/><p>From then onwards, \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d will enter the post-YuShengfan era, an era where heroes gathered. There will never be such an abnormal super genius appearing again to steal the limelight</p><br/><p>Perhaps some readers who insanely loved Little Fish would quit reading after the extreme disappointment. Yet, Rosemary believed that most readers would still believe in him and continue following this book. He was also confident of creating more attractive content in the future!</p><br/><p>Based on his own inspiration, Rosemary who was totally lost in a drunken stupor finished the climatic battle between Yu Shengfan and Lin Feng in one shot. Perhaps, this could become the most iconic scene in all of gaming novel history!</p><br/><p>For comparison, in the iconic \u2018wuxia\u2019 martial arts genre, such a scene would be the final duel on the rooftops of the Forbidden Palace between the Lord of Fort Bai Yun, Ye Gucheng, and Ximen Chuixue. That had to be the most iconic one-on-one battle in the history of martial arts novels.</p><br/><p>Similarly, Yu Shengfan and Lin Feng\u2019s battle had the potential of becoming an epic battle that would forever be recorded in the history of great scenes!</p><br/><p>Originally, Rosemary wanted to present Yu Shengfan as an entity who was a whole class above Lin Feng, winning the battle as a result. Anyway, she would not live any longer, why not let her leave the world as a glorious victory? She has never lost a single solo battle ever since her debut in \u201cEternal War\u201d. Even professional players who were simply testing their skills in the new server fell under her sword, never bringing out her full potential for a single moment. She would still continue sending</p><br/><p>out infuriating chat bubbles that burst the blood vessels of her opponents with ease during the battle\u2026</p><br/><p>That was why everybody knew that despite her relatively new appearance, she already had the potential of a professional player. This was talent, undisputable talent, unreasonable talent!</p><br/><p>At the end of it all, Rosemary decided to let the battle end inconclusively. He wanted Yu Shengfan to live in Lin Feng\u2019s glory for all eternity. Lin Feng will carry the legacy and regrets of Little Fish and continue his fight.</p><br/><p>He brought this out by hinting that Yu Shengfan has found a flaw in her opponent, at last. As long as she controls her swordmistress who drifted like one with the wind, capitalizing on that flaw, Lin Feng would have lost\u2026</p><br/><p>Yet, she did not manage to do that. Her extremely good timing and weak spot targeting abilities were held back by her failing body.</p><br/><p>She stared at the computer screen regretfully, looking at both the male and female characters within. Finally, she closed her eyes in acceptance, bearing a peaceful smile on her lips. This was nothing alike to the energetic girl who jumped around all day long. She always seemed to be a walking hurricane, a truly annoying poltergeist. Yu Shengfan actually loved to smile, no matter how painful her body was in. She would smile freely, sneering loudly at the world, mocking everyone else, just like an</p><br/><p>aggregation of negativity. Yet in her death, she was so quiet and tranquil. No more rattlings and an unpredictable venomous tongue which was accurate yet heart-piercing could be heard\u2026</p><br/><p>In the beginning, when Yu Shengfan made her over-the-top entrance and abused plus mocked Tang Yongkai who was a friend of the protagonist, plenty of readers were greatly ired. They found her rude and obnoxious. Those readers would be reminded of the trolls and vulgar keyboard warriors they tend to meet in games. When they found out that Yu Shengfan was subdued by the godly Lin Feng and will likely become his teammate, only then would they slowly changed their impression towards her, or at least that was the plan.</p><br/><p>There were still some who still maintained that they did not like such a vulgar character, they just couldn\u2019t understand what was Moe about such a character. Now that Rosemary has revealed Yu Shengfan\u2019s tragic past and her incurable illness which causes her great pain, leading her into a torturous life of swallowing pills after pills every day, those readers who thought that Yu Shengfan was a rude troll would fall silent, hopefully\u2026</p><br/><p>If one were to step into Yu Shengfan\u2019s shoes, they will see that she was living on the last embers of her life, while being abandoned by her family at the same time. Nobody spoke to her nor cared about her. Not only was her body tortured by illness, her mind was also tormented, developing insecurities and paranoia. She was even led to believe that her illness was infectious, and while she could abandon that notion from time to time, it would forever come back to haunt her. That was why she did not even dare to hold his hand when she met a man who she could trust, a man that could bring her warmth. She was only afraid that she would pass her misfortune to him\u2026</p><br/><p>If such a fate fell upon another person, they would have lost their mind, and eventually lose their lives in their own hands. Yu Shengfan only became loud, brash, vocal. Just how strong and optimistic was this person?!</p><br/><p>The character under Little Fish\u2019s control froze to a halt all of a sudden. Lin Feng did not hold back, but killed the swordsmistress right away. He wiped away the cold sweat from his forehead and sighed in relief. He was just a moment away from getting his face blown up. He chuckled and spoke to Little Fish through the microphone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did your hands spazz up or something? Got a cramp from moving so quickly? What were you thinking? Stopping there, typing something to mock me? By the way, I\u2019ve never heard your venomous voice before, what a pity\u201d</p><br/><p>It was truly a pity, for Lin Feng would never ever hear the venomous tongue of Yu Shengfan even if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>Three days later, Lin Feng received a courier from Yu Shengfan. Inside it was a big gift pack left by Yu Shengfan, including the priceless account number of \u201cUnpleasant Night Rain Rhythm,\u201d plus the incomplete self-forged weapon within it, and also a diary.</p><br/><p>He was actually quite furious, because Little Fish had not gone online for three days. She had already promised to join his Glorious Squad, and it was time to start group training and various tactic drills.</p><br/><p>What a petulant missy!</p><br/><p>He was rather baffled when he received the courier package, until he flipped through Yu Shengfan\u2019s diary\u2026</p>\n</div>"}

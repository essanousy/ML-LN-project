It had returned.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, Han Leng was a talented author. He would never forget to polish up his writing skill even though he had the talent; this was the reason he could earn some pocket money despite his young age.</p><br/><p>Such a talented author would sometimes get inspiration without the help of Zhao Youyue\u2019s \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d as if they had entered their very own literary world.</p><br/><p>They would write down every little thing they see and put their thoughts on paper, and the resulting content would be fascinating. It would definitely get the readers hooked to it.</p><br/><p>There was this one young author who was only 19 years old, and had named himself \u201cSilkworm Potato,\u201d he had created the novel \u201cFight Break Sphere,\u201d and it was one of the top books in Qidian! Following that, his previous work became famous overnight, while this book turned him a legend! He would never have to bother about making money again!</p><br/><p>Two of his works were at the top of the chart; the other authors could only be envious of his success.</p><br/><p>Although this is a parallel world, many famous people and the events concerning ancient dynasties have changed, but some facts remained unchanged. \u201cSilkworm Potato\u201d and \u201cMasashi Kishimoto,\u201d who drew the manga of \u201cNaruto\u201d were experienced authors, and their works had been adapted as anime. The worlds they created exist in our reality as well.</p><br/><p>Some other famous authors or masterpieces were different. Interestingly,people had thought that the original lyrics in \u201cSouth Mountain\u201d were created by Rosemary. Zhao Youyue might even get credit for composing that song.</p><br/><p>Despite their young ages, talented authors can create a wonderful literary world, even if they did not have the writing skills to fully express it, making readers feel as if they are in that world themselves! How passionate!</p><br/><p>Once the \u201cFight Break Sphere\u201d is released, many other copycats would start to appear, and they would never be able to surpass the original, because those authors would never get their own \u201cinspiration,\u201d they were merely copying without inserting their own vein into it\u2026</p><br/><p>Lately, Han Leng was at a loss of inspiration, and while he was \u201ctraining to be an immortal,\u201d he had suddenly realized that his mind had traveled into the world of \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d There, he met a girl who left him a deep impressionChu Luoxun.</p><br/><p>At first, Han Leng had just created Chu Luoxun for fun, because he needed someone to be the rival of his main protagonist, or else he would not be able to show off how talented the main hero was\u2026</p><br/><p>The reason he had made Chu Luoxun so incredible, beautiful and talented in playing music was because he wanted to make sure she would still lose to the main hero, Gu Yuan. Finally, she would acknowledge the talent of Gu Yuan in playing the piano, and that scene would certainly be interesting.</p><br/><p>This is how iconic hollow literature is written. Han Leng was already familiar with all sorts of way of creating a hollow literature that is associated with web novels.</p><br/><p>In fact, if he continues writing his second web novel, he might even create something that is at the same level with \u201cFight Break Sphere\u201d, but it might probably be like \u201cFighter of the Destiny\u201d or \u201cSnow Blade\u201d. It would be pure and exciting, because Han Leng had outstanding writing skills.</p><br/><p>But Han Leng never did so. Instead he chose to write \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d He wanted to satisfy himself with his own fantasies, because he had failed in romance.</p><br/><p>He wanted to forget about Zhao Youyue once he completes this \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d because everything had become a reality in the book.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this the most beautiful part of writing a novel?</p><br/><p>Nothing would go as planned in reality.</p><br/><p>Han Leng never thought up of the characteristics of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d, and he definitely never would have thought Chu Luoxun would help the main hero and heroine in their relationship.</p><br/><p>But then suddenly, his inspiration \u201cexploded,\u201d he knew exactly how to create the character \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d He took out a flashlight and started scribbling on his secret memo. As he was jotting down the contents of his \u201cinspiration,\u201d others that did not know better would think that he was burning the midnight oil to improve his studies.</p><br/><p>This is not his first time writing in the middle of the night, in fact, he had already lost count. It was quiet night, accompanied by the snores in the dorm. He would write in his memo or directly into his phone.</p><br/><p>As he was writing \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d he felt conflicted, because sometimes he would be happy, anxious or even sad. He had inserted all of his feelings into his first romance novel.</p><br/><p>He believed that even if he is destined to be alone, words would always stay by his side.</p><br/><p>That was good enough for him.</p><br/><p>As the dateline was fast approaching, with the help of his suddenly outbursting \u201cinspiration,\u201d he started to write at an incredible speed!</p><br/><p>Although the character, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was indeed incredible, he still loved \u201cLin Meiyue\u201d more, because this main heroine had a special place in his heart, and nobody can ever replace that. Even though Chu Luoxun was struck rather hard by misfortune, she would never interfere the perfect love of the main hero and heroine.</p><br/><p>He would make sure Chu Luoxun and Gu Yuan never fall in love with each other, they were just childhood friends, and Chu Luoxun sincerely wanted the main hero and heroine to find happiness in their relationship.</p><br/><p>However, Han Leng\u2019s instinct had told him the readers might not agree with his plan; it would be awkward if the readers want to change the main heroine.</p><br/><p>Han Leng had actually wanted to create a single couple, there would be obstacles in their relationship, but there would be no threats powerful enough to derail the whole affair, he might even add in the meddlings of a female bestie of the main heroine like Wang Yan, just to spice things up a little. There would be a rival for the main hero, one who would mess things up a little for Han Leng to show that the main hero had a very high level of EQ.</p><br/><p>The main heroine\u2019s position would be secure, and no other female character would pose a threat to her. Some female characters in certain novels were so popular that the readers would demand that she take over the role of the main heroine, and the decision would be up to the main hero, but in actuality, this would be up to a poll option for the readers to vote\u2026</p><br/><p>When that happens, some people will rejoice because the couple they supported had ended up together, but some people would suffer terribly because the opposite had happened.</p><br/><p>Usually, this happens when a particular female character is too outstanding in a particular novel, and the main hero in a harem novel would always play dumb and milk the plot.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was not writing a harem novel, but a romance novel, Gu Yuan would only love Lin Meiyue till the end, just like him!</p><br/><p>In conclusion, Han Leng would make Chu Luoxun die, no matter the circumstances. She would never have the chance to be with the main hero.</p><br/><p>Actually, he had already \u201clost his sense\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>Even then, he still believed that his mind was sober.</p>\n</div>"}

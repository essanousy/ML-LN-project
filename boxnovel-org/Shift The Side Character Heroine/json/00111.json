The red packets given by these two cousins were pretty decent since one of them was not short of money while the other one was a famous uploader in Bilibili, the advertisement fees could already support her, hence they would not be stingy on Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>This was also because Zhao Youyue had shown them something impressive, thus they had acknowledged her.</p><br/><p>For instance, she became \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d in the cyber cafe and saved Zhao Hao from embarrassment, which satisfied this young master of Zhao family who was a braggart. He acknowledged Zhao Youyue as part of the Zhao family, unlike how he used to ignore this little cousin who had no sense of presence.</p><br/><p>How did one have no sense of presence at all?</p><br/><p>Probably because she was too mediocre, nothing special or different from the crowd. However, Zhao Youyue had shown her the gaming skills which totally made the game-loving Zhao Hao remembered her.</p><br/><p>How proud could he be for having such sister?</p><br/><p>Even though Zhao Youyue did not join Zhao Hao Esports\u2019 team, but she promised him that she would play with him during her leisure time, so that he could show offDid you see that? This is my little sister! Her champion Yasuo was great right? Definitely awesome!</p><br/><p>Some words may sound unpleasant to ears but they are indeed reasonable. For instance, there is no equality among people, as to be acknowledged by others, you have to first prove your worthiness. If you are only a mediocre person, will they ever distinguish you?</p><br/><p>Formerly, Zhao Hao had found Zhao Youyue pleasing to the eye. She felt this little cousin looked average besides having an alluring voice and a gentle personality. But with these few traits, he would not remember her for long.</p><br/><p>Even though they gathered once every Chinese New Year, he had not got any closer to Zhao Youyue because they rarely interacted.</p><br/><p>Having displayed her extreme gaming skills, Zhao Youyue deeply impressed Zhao Hao. He then started taking initiative to get closer to Zhao Youyue. He felt she was indeed skillful and worthy of a close relationship.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhao Hao was always mediocre in doing things, he was good at judging people. People whom he got to know were those being useful to him. He even discriminated people who were not in the Zhao family, unless they possessed some extraordinary ability.</p><br/><p>He had his unique way of managing and recruiting people. He was able to do it without a mentor, so his investment company was in even keel, and his father and Grandpa Zhao were assured of his abilities.</p><br/><p>Hence, his absurd style of living and his extravagance in spending money had been tolerated by them. Since he was able to use his ability to recruit people with skills, and they were helping him to earn money, it was already more than enough. Eventually when he became more mature, although he might not be able to expand the Zhao family, he can at least still maintain their reputation.</p><br/><p>Right now, Zhao Hao realized that Zhao Youyue was not as simple as she looked. He thus took the initiative to flatter Zhao Youyue just as how he got connected to those people who had talents. He even tapped his chest and told Zhao Youyue that he would buy anything she wanted upon her request.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Hao first knew that Zhang Wanjun was a famous uploader in Bilibili, he tried to ingratiate himself with her too, despite knowing nothing about the kichiku [1] videos that she created. He discerned that over a million followers on her Weibo were true fans, not zombie fans, unlike him who had over three million Weibo followers but only a few hundred thousand true fans. The rest of them were some fake fans bought by him with money.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao knew his cousin, Zhang Wanjun was talented, so he hoped to bring her alongside him and utilized her. Though she did not carry the surname of \u201cZhao\u201d, but her mother was his dad\u2019s sister, and her father was the mayor of the city. Of course, he should get on the good side of this noble-family daughter.</p><br/><p>As long as they maintained a good relationship, he could care less when he got scolded as mentally handicapped or a scum by his cousin. Since everyone was in Shanghai, they could come out and have a meal together, he could still show off in front of his friends, \u201cMy cousin is the famous \u2018Black &amp; White Z Mold\u2019 uploader in Bilibili, a super elite scholar grade goddess in Sun Moon University, do you guys not admire her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, his friends would be surprised, this handsome-looking, wearing frameless spectacles reflecting her cool gaze is a girl? Her tone of voice was neutral too</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao even gave her an SUV worth millions, she accepted it anyway. She considered it as borrowing on the surface because of her family background. Her father is an officer so she needs to mind the effects.</p><br/><p>Now, Zhao Youyue became the next target whom Zhao Hao admired and flattered. Not to mention, he sensed more intimacy between them for having the same surname, Zhao. Besides, Zhao Hao found Zhao Youyue was actually more mysterious and unpredictable, as he could never see through the superficially serene look of Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wanjun paid attention to Zhao Youyue because she realized that Zhao Youyue was very good at language. Zhang Wanjun\u2019s English level was fluent, and she planned to study abroad after graduating from university, but she was not that fluent in other languages.</p><br/><p>Some fans hoped that she could make a video about a Japanese game, but she realized the game was not translated into Chinese, so she was stuck and could not do anything about it.</p><br/><p>The \u201clanguage master\u201d Zhao Youyue had come online, she successfully helped Zhang Wanjun with the translation issue, and she acknowledged Zhao Youyue as a fellow person, an elite scholar more powerful than her, so she did not bother about Zhao Youyue\u2019s venomous tongue while in the process of helping her.</p><br/><p>People were allowed to be fickle when they had the talents, they could ignore others and manifest their arrogance.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wanjun even warned Zhao Hao not to ruin Xiao Youyue\u2019s future, turning her into a mentally handicapped person like him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao smiled at her and told her that he would not do that because they were all in the same family, he too hoped to see Zhao Youyue becoming more and more outstanding because she was his little sister!</p><br/><p>However, Zhang Wangjun would not have thought that this elite scholar in her eyes, Zhao Youyue was still rushing to finish up her holiday homework before the winter holidays ended</p><br/><p>Even with \u201cXu Jing\u2019s possession\u201d mode, Zhao Youyue realized that she would not be able to finish it in time, so she used her own methodsmartphone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was feeling helpless too, why she was not able to finish her winter holiday homework, where did she spend her time?</p><br/><p>After returning to the provincial capital, she did not do anything other than playing her smartphone and surfing the internet, and the days just passed by</p><br/><p>Even though Zhao Youyue had exited from \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d already, she was still reading this Esport novel that caught her interest. The recent plot of the novel did not feel right.</p><br/><p>This Rosemary might stir up some serious trouble!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1. In Japanese, kichiku() literally means \u201cbrutal\u201d or \u201cdemonic\u201d. It is a common Japanese character type, the bastard-boyfriend type who is an Always Male Love Interest whose defining trait is that he is cold, cruel, or abusive to his romantic partner, in a manner intended to be kinky and appealing to the audience.</p>\n</div>"}

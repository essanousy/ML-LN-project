Even though her fury had its appeal, just like the arrogant female character in the anime, audiences looked for fun, not to be scolded.</p><br/><p>This is why Zhao Youyue\u2019s or Yu Shengfan\u2019s live broadcast had failed to gain popularity. Not to mention that she was not contracted to any specific sponsors or Dou Yu live broadcast\u2019s platform. Without these, her live broadcast schedule would not appear on the homepage.</p><br/><p>However, Ye Hai was not disgusted by this voice. On the contrary, he felt it connecting with him. It even brought him back to the nostalgia of his \u201cintoxicated state\u201d.</p><br/><p>In that state, it was as if him entering his own literary world where he could closely observe every character. Yu Shengfan, being the active and talkative one, would grab his attention the most, among others. Her indistinguishable voice had been engraved in his mind since then.</p><br/><p>All this while, he had always believed that such a voice only existed in his imagination. A hallucination that was the result from being overly obsessed in his literary work.</p><br/><p>Now, he was completely stunned by the familiar voice once again. Could it be possible that Yu Shengfan really existed in this world?</p><br/><p>It had to be a coincidence</p><br/><p>He was confused and lost. He could not deny that Yu Shengfan totally fascinated him. It gave him the reason to be obsessed with her as he pleased, as she was a character from his work. After all, she was just a two dimensional character. He could not be accused of conducting an affair, right?</p><br/><p>Moreover, the justification he gave himself was that, in order to better depict this character, he had to be obsessed with her</p><br/><p>Alright, Ye Hai had to admit that he got caught roleplaying the male protagonist\u2019s role named Lin Feng. At that time, he was writing the ending part of Yu Shengfan. How does losing a beloved one feel like? In order to better portray this sadness, he method-acted Lin Feng himself.</p><br/><p>Then, Ye Hai put what he felt into words. It left many readers in awe and sent tears to almost twice as many eyes. The death of Yu Shengfan profoundly impacted Lin Feng, especially when he realized that he had insensibly fallen for her but never got the opportunity to express it.</p><br/><p>Well, if Yu Shengfen was still alive, Lin Feng would have been not discovered his admiration for her that had grown silently, deep within him. Yu Shengfen would still be treated as a good teammate or buddy.</p><br/><p>Now, faced with the possibility that Yu Shengfen has appeared in this three dimensional world, he felt exactly like how Lin Feng would feel, finding out that Yu Shengfen was still alive. To him, it was like her appearing out of nowehere again, just being her mischievous self again, teasing him for crying</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Ye Hai still had a firm enough grasp on reality. He knew that, ultimately, he was not Lin Feng, but a web novelist with a family. He was not Lin Feng, the single dog[1]. He was also not a member of the \u201cE-sports Who Does Not Need Love\u201d community. In addition to that, he was loyal to his family.</p><br/><p>In the live broadcast studio, Ye Hai found himself being carried away while listening to \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s\u201d non-stop talking. His mind drifted back to his older days where he was a little-known web novelist. Now, he was a reputable web novelist who stood out among the entire community. His work, \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, was going to be adapted into an animation film. An epiphany occurred to him. Could he invite this livestreamer whose voice matched the Yu Shengfen\u2019s voice in his mind to become the voice actress of Yu Shengfen in his animation film?</p><br/><p>His mind connected the dots, and a certain song titled, \u201cSouth Hill South\u201d in his literary work popped out in his mind. This song never existed in reality. During that time, many readers praised the super talented Mi Diexiang. Even the songs sung by Xiao Yu to Lin Feng were original.</p><br/><p>However, Ye Hai knew that this song was not his original creation. It was created by Yu Shengfan, and he merely committed it to memory with a passion.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai thought that this song really existed in reality as he was not familiar with folk rhyme. He even wanted to search for more of this song to put in on repeat. The way Xiao Yu had sung this song was simply a paradise for the ears. Alright, other web novelists might find it hard to comprehend if they knew that Mi Diexiang could hear the voices from the literary world as he wrote. This was a surprising phenomenon, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Hence, Ye Hai searched this song using Baidu and found that it was unavailable. The lyrics existed only in his literary work. He grew dejected. Perhaps his so-called inspiration was more of a hallucination. The voice of Xiao Yu singing in his literary world was merely his hallucination.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ye Hai thought that this could be used to verify the identity of this crazy streamer who self-proclaimed herself as the three dimensional Yu Shengfan.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ye Hai knew that it wasn\u2019t nice of him to do this. He launched the barrage anyway</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, since you confidently claim yourself to be the three dimensional Yu Shengfan, do you even know how to sing \u201cSouth Hill South\u201d? If not, you are just an imposter with a sharp-tongue.\u201d</p><br/><p>This barraged had caused a ripple in the chat stream. Audiences who disliked her but had been unable to refute her self-proclamation started to chant for Zhao Youyue to sing \u201cSouth Hill South\u201d.</p><br/><p>However, other audiences immediately jumped to her defense</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this \u201cSouth Hill South\u201d only a bunch of lyrics on paper? How does one even sing it? Don\u2019t start a shitstorm for nothing, just watch her play, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous. Is it possible to compose a melody for these lyrics which were unintentionally written by Mi Diexiang? Besides, they are incomplete. You\u2019re asking her to actually complete it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! You\u2019re not happy with her roleplay? Why must she sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe just perfectly acting out the role as Yu Shengfenit is impossible for her to sing \u201cSouth Hill South\u201d. Shameless pricks\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue soon noticed the change in the chat stream. It was about her time for her to go off, and she wanted to play the game no more. She then took a deep breath and began to sing into the mic before her.</p><br/><p>You faced the southern bright sun on this snowy day</p><br/><p>Spring was the only season I felt although I was in the freezing night in the north</p><br/><p>I wanted to forget your eyes before dawn</p><br/><p>Spending my life on an untrue dream that never ends</p><br/><p>There were hills in the south, gloominess only intensified by autumn in the north</p><br/><p>There are heaps of grains in the south</p><br/><p>South wind whispers to the air over the northern sea</p><br/><p>Our love will eventually be buried under the tombstones in the northern sea</p><br/><p>After singing, Zhao Youyue humphed arrogantly and ended her broadcast. She did not even express gratitude to the excited tycoons who had sent her rockets as she was singing. Making her exit after being cool was so exciting for her.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai was excited and shocked. He too sent her rockets. Now, he became even more fascinated. This \u201cSouth Hill South\u201d was exactly what he heard before and, this time, in full version!</p><br/><p>Holy sh*t! My fictional character actually time-traveled to this three dimensional world. What a suffocating operation\u2026he truly felt out of breath and would need an oxygen mask to prevent himself from blacking out.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1.

Thus, her act of performing a major change on a side-character this time would not go unnoticed. There was probably a high chance that the creator would censor it away\u2026</p><br/><p>It could not be helped. She was completely unfamiliar with the producer Zha Feng. She was not even sure if he was the screenwriter of the game. Who would react to all her actions in the game world? Who would get \u201cintoxicated\u201d? She remained uncertain about this.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue was neither timid nor indecisive. She would try to direct the story in accordance to the personality of her ideal character as much as possible. In the end, only fate determined if the producer of the game adapted to her changes.</p><br/><p>At that moment in the game world, she had successfully left the dark Kingdom of Zhao palace. The personality she set for \u201cJane Doe\u201d was also completely out of tune with the atmosphere of the game \u2014- \u2014- she was a true, genuine knight.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had learned more about this game. Many players thought that it was a waste to put the word \u201cknight\u201d in the game name. This game harbored no knights. Everyone was calculative, manipulative, and selfish. As long as they had the strength, they would bully the weak. Even players were commonly playing as such!</p><br/><p>Many players focused on killing others and looting their treasures. Of course, after completing specific quests, they would turn around and kill the NPC. It was really mean, but fun. This was somewhat similar to the game \u201cThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\u201d Upon completing a quest you could turn around and kill the NPC. Oh, the spoils and riches. The \u2018free gifts.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cTale of Wuxia 3\u201d also had the same settings. As long as you had the heart for it, you could even kill the heroine off. Here, killing off some girls was the way of life!</p><br/><p>However, the difficulty of \u201cTale of Wuxia 3\u201d restricted the freedom of the players. Of course, they could choose to start a fight with the NPC, but if they were not skilled enough, all they could do was to watch the NPC flay the skin off their bones. This was especially the case with players who wanted to obtain the sword of the \u201cSword God\u201d Li Xiye. Although they have been killed by Li Xiye countless times, many players enjoyed it so much they were not bored of dying yet\u2026</p><br/><p>That was just how players were. To them, a game was just a game. Even if the game world was a dark, nasty place, they would not be bothered. In the game world, most of them were emotionless scumbags.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue hoped that her character would bring change to the tone of the game and potentially influence some players. This would be the motherlode of all challenges she had in the past.</p><br/><p>In this game world where there were no real knights, Zhao Youyue chose to be a knight.</p><br/><p>What was a knight?</p><br/><p>A knight was someone who was capable of helping people who were weaker than them without expecting anything in return.</p><br/><p>Knights existed to serve the country and the people!</p><br/><p>This game world was ruthless. Natural disasters, man-made disasters, wars, demons, ghosts, you name it. It had everything!</p><br/><p>Previously, whenever Zhao Youyue played games, she often took the typical side quests. It was those types of quests where you had to help some villagers find their relatives and such. In this game, she would only find a shoe attached to a severed leg or something</p><br/><p>All in all, even the quests of this game were nasty. You can only end with a bad ending, or a not so bad ending.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, most of the people lived in conditions worse than those of pigs and dogs. Even so, players still rummaged through their houses in search of stuff. They even looted their rotten meat.</p><br/><p>Now, Zhao Youyue walked in this game world. She decided to create a character that could bring a little warmth to this dark, miserable world, even though this nameless girl had once lived an equally miserable life. She had experienced a terrible childhood.</p><br/><p>This girl knew few words, knew no friends, but she knew her sword.</p><br/><p>This girl was all action and no words. She sort of lived by the saying, \u201cwhen there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>This girl was not even aware that what she did was heroic. She did not even know that word. She simply wanted to help the weak.</p><br/><p>The girl did not know what love was. She was not an idealist who was looking for the right way of living. She was also not trying to save the whole world. She just chose to use her sword to do something in her power, no matter how insignificant they might be\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, there was one thing the girl could not forget. That was \u2014- \u2014- patricide.</p><br/><p>As long as a player is slightly knowledgeable about history, they should be able to tell that Shi Hu was the archetype of the character Su Hu, the tyrant.</p><br/><p>Shi Hu was not so much of a tyrant as he was a pervert. If anyone went to search it up on Baidu casually, they would know how cruel he was. Throughout the game, there would be various scenes that demonstrated how tyrannical he was. Even though there was a saying that goes \u201ceven a vicious tiger would not eat its cubs,\u201d Shi Hu did not hesitate to murder his son\u2026</p><br/><p>So, whether it was for the sake of her mother, who was tortured to death, or for the sake of all the people of the Kingdom of Zhao, the nameless girl would still choose to commit crimes.</p><br/><p>The girl was not incapable of thinking critically. She had always been accumulating power silently. This was not a world where everyone was highly skilled, after all. Every person had their limits.</p><br/><p>The girl went about, helping others, without expecting anything in return, in the hope that one day, she could meet someone who would do the same for her.</p><br/><p>In that case, she would even lay down her life for this person.</p><br/><p>In sandbox games like this one, a new map would appear with every new DLC.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had also used Jane Doe\u2019s identity to create a \u201cnameless city,\u201d which was a paradise amidst the cruel, troubled world.</p><br/><p>This city had been built from the ground up, using the money she had accumulated through accepting and completing various tasks that had been entrusted to her. She slew demons and banished devils. She lived on the edge. The orphans that she rescued in the process of helping others would also be sent to the nameless city\u2026</p><br/><p>However, nobody would ever know who built this nameless city, because the girl would always disappear without a trace \u2013 immediately after her job there was done. She would remain anonymous, uncredited.</p><br/><p>The nameless city would be a new thing in the game. There would be no rewards for the completion of quests originating from that city. Only the players who were the most bored would attempt the quests. As they continue to spam the quests, they would be able to obtain more information about the girl. Otherwise, they would make the wrong choices and tread wrongly around the girl when they finally meet, only to regret it for their whole lives.</p><br/><p>In the gaming world, Zhao Youyue\u2019s first encounter with the players would be when they were on the verge of death.</p><br/><p>The players would definitely feel that they have met an angel!</p><br/><p>This may not be a pretty angel, as she would be wrapped up in gray rags and only wielded a single sword, it did not matter.</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue hoped that this character would leave a deep impression on the players, she had to interact with them. The story behind this character would only thoroughly torture the players \u2013 if she manages to get into their hearts beforehand!</p><br/><p>The moment players are placed in a \u201chero saved by a beauty\u201d situation, they would finally believe that the producer Zha Feng had finally found his conscience. He has finally shown \u201cthe mercy of Zha Feng.\u201d However, when they discover the ending for this nameless girl, they would soon learn that they had been too naive!</p><br/><p>The mercy of Zha Feng?</p><br/><p>Nonexistent!</p><br/><p>Only the wickedness of Zha Feng had eternal existence!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

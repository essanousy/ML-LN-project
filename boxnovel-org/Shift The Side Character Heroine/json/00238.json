Han Leng had planned this all out. He knew that \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d did not have any other motive, and she was sincerely happy for Lin Meiyue\u2019s advancement. However, instead of writing her actual thoughts, he had cunningly described how lonely she was at that moment, torturing their fans to the maximum.</p><br/><p>Han Leng is a guileful creator, in nature. In his \u201cintoxicated state,\u201d that nature would only be amplified!</p><br/><p>Sometimes, it is not necessary to lie entirely. Instead, one just has to hide part of the truth, and then induce others into believing in their own conclusions. That would be the most brilliant lie!</p><br/><p>It had been stated before that Han Leng favored \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Therefore, he knew exactly what to write about this character, in order to stir up a huge controversy, and to garner the most sympathy possible for her</p><br/><p>He had even taken the risk of placing the star-crossed lovers in the line of fire, or in other words, they no longer concerned him. This would be the aftermath of the \u201cintoxicated state.\u201d It could quickly destroy the article and completely deviate from the original intention.</p><br/><p>After the scene of Goddess Chu crying desperately at the hospital while the male protagonist and the heroine were enjoying the affection between them, the number of irrational readers who hated this couple increased.</p><br/><p>They did not care if both of them knew about Chu Luoxun\u2019s illness, all they knew was, because of her, only could they become a couple. Here, they are happily showing off their affection for each other, while Chu Luoxun suffers alone. Isn\u2019t this too much? Don\u2019t they feel ashamed?</p><br/><p>When this chapter gets released, without a doubt, Lin Meiyue, the heroine, would be despised by many readers, because of her actions. Her unscrupulous tactics of protecting her relationship would turn her into a controversial character, a villain, perhaps!</p><br/><p>Some people would think that she did nothing wrong, as love is selfish. All she wanted to do was to own Gu Yuan\u2019s heart fully, and there was nothing wrong with it. Some people would see her as a mean girl, thinking that her accusations of Goddess Chu intending to steal her boyfriend were completely groundless, what was so suspicious about the musical interaction between her and Gu Yuan?</p><br/><p>Han Leng truly intended to watch the world burn!</p><br/><p>As this work was about to be completed, he wanted to write a memorable ending of the ages</p><br/><p>The plot continued brewing. During the ensemble, the waltz between Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue had opened their hearts to each other, and their souls became one.</p><br/><p>Lim Meiyue\u2014Unlike others, I was not longing to become a professional musician, neither was I devoting myself to music. But, as he is with me now, and there are songs that I want to play for him, I will become a violinist like no other. This is the reason for my performance!</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun intended to bring warmth and joy to the world through music, it would be sufficient for me, as long as my music heals him!</p><br/><p>I was performing just for him!</p><br/><p>It is going to end soon. Strangely, something told me to push myself past my limits, even to the point of absolute exhaustion. Performing together with him was truly an indulgence</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan, why is the sound of your piano so colorful and alluring? It brings tears to my eyes.</p><br/><p>She did not do so, yet, she gave a smile of victory.</p><br/><p>Their performance ended. On the other end, Chu Luoxun, who had her head bowed down, as if she was the one who had just finished performing, shed a solitary tear.</p><br/><p>No one would cheer for her, and no one would ever know that she was the composer of \u201cWings of Piano,\u201d as Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue basked in the standing ovation!</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue turned and asked Gu Yuan, \u201cDid you receive my love through the music?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gu Yuan answered happily.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the other girl\u2019s intentions were made clear. Even Chu Luoxun could see that. The openhearted Chu Luoxun found a way to be happy for that as well. She cried because of Lin Meiyue\u2019s advancement, feeling nothing but happiness for her disciple.</p><br/><p>However, instead of telling readers the truth, Han Leng simply mentioned Chu Luoxun letting tears flow down her cheeks as Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue laughed, holding each other\u2019s hands and bowing to the audiences. The starker the contrast, the more upsetting it would be.</p><br/><p>The readers would definitely feel sorry for her, from the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>When it was all over, Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue visited Chu Luoxun. She was on the rooftop, playing with two kids who loved music. She played for them the song \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star\u201d by using a harmonica\u2014Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are</p><br/><p>The bright, unforced, smile appeared on her face again. She was satisfied, as long as she could cheer these two music-loving kids up.</p><br/><p>Her face was pale and sickly, her body almost anorexic.</p><br/><p>When she saw both of them, she smiled and said \u201cBoth of you are so naughty. Letting a violin teacher who is unable to play the violin listen to a perfect ensemble. Isn\u2019t that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you guys make me feel even more love for this world, right now?\u201d she added in her heart.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan earnestly suggested that he would like to have an ensemble with her, while he stared at her beautiful, optimistic smile. He was always trying to keep up with her, as he wanted to be side by side with her.</p><br/><p>The former Chu Luoxun would say yes, but, now, she crossed her trembling arms in front of her chest and looked carefully at Lin Meiyue, who seemed a little awkward.</p><br/><p>Both her body condition and the hidden message that was sent out by Lin Meiyue during the ensemble caused her to hesitate</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan thought that this was the best encouragement for her. He would take it as a rehearsal for the National Piano Competition, which would be held in December, although that would be a solo performance.</p><br/><p>He had even chosen which song to be played. It was not a serious, classical music, but an in-trend kind of song that was \u201coriginally\u201d written by Lin Meiyue\u2014\u201cWings of An Angel.\u201d It would become a popular song that everyone would know by heart.</p><br/><p>Seeing her hesitate, Han Leng tried to \u201csmooth-talk\u201d her, as he eagerly wanted to compete with her. Eventually, Lin Meiyue was the one who made her agree with him.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue wanted her to have an ensemble with Gu Yuan. However, she would join too, as a competitor. She just wanted to find out who he preferred performing with more.</p><br/><p>She was no less than Chu Luxun, and she would not hold herself back. Her music was only dedicated to Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun laughed, thinking that Lin Meiyue had grown a lot. However, little did they know what they would put the goddess through</p><br/><p>They were not even aware that they were forcing her to make that kind of choice.</p><br/><p>When she has to choose between life and music, she always chooses the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this, it would be very risky, andeven if it turns out smoothly\u201d The doctor advised Chu Luoxun.</p><br/><p>\u201cI acknowledge itand I have told my parents. I am prepared for this, so I would like to undergo the operation.\u201d Chu Luoxun stood firm in her position.</p><br/><p>The doctor sighed, and nodded resignedly, while looked at her sympathetically.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun smiled again. She thought of the melody of the \u201cWings of An Angel,\u201d and the lyrics lingered in her head too\u2014</p><br/><p>Where\u2019ll the wind send the fallen leaves</p><br/><p>What\u2019s left is the beautiful sky</p><br/><p>The once fluttering sound</p><br/><p>Just like an angel\u2019s wings</p><br/><p>My love\u2019s like a guardian angel</p><br/><p>If here\u2019s the end of life</p><br/><p>And I exist no more</p><br/><p>I will find an angel for me to love you</p><br/><p>I believe you\u2019re still here</p><br/><p>Never have you left</p><br/><p>My love\u2019s like a guardian angel</p><br/><p>If here\u2019s the end of life</p><br/><p>And I exist no more</p><br/><p>I will find an angel for me to love you</p><br/><p>I will find an angel for me to love you</p><br/><p>Please do not misunderstand. The \u201cyou\u201d in the lyrics was the music. It was up to the readers now, on how they want to interpret it, as it was not within Han Leng\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>What a cunning twat.</p>\n</div>"}

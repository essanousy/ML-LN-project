He often told himself that he could not care less about whether Lady Zhao got into a relationship with other guys. If Lady Zhao could bid farewell to her \u2018single\u2019 status, he would finally be free. However, after he discovered a certain senior\u2019s intentions of pursuing Lady Zhao, only then did he realize that he actually cared very much about her still.</p><br/><p>Humans are like so. They are never rational, never logical.</p><br/><p>However, after Han Leng silently listened to Lady Zhao\u2019s response, he became relieved. He scolded himself in his heart. Why did he not have any self-control\u2026</p><br/><p>As Lady Zhao made a mockery out of the question, Han Leng found himself more entranced than ever. He knew that if he did the same thing, he would be shot down like this too.</p><br/><p>Cao Chuanguang did not seem to notice the grave he was digging for himself. He was reading the situation in a non-existent light. To him, Zhao Youyue was \u2018earnestly\u2019 answering all of his questions in detail. It was a sign that she liked him, that she was comfortable to open up to him.</p><br/><p>Exhilarated, he could not help but offer an invitation to Zhao Youyue and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have lunch together at the Newspaper Club. I could show you about as I am very familiar with the surroundings of Jiangnan University.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Chuanguang was quick-witted. He had worded things in a way that suggested \u2018lunch\u2019 meant eating with the entire Newspaper Club. In reality, he was only doing this to lower Zhao Yuoyue\u2019s guard. Obviously, he would be the only person going out on a date at that time. Would his club members dare to wreck the club president\u2019s plan of hanging out with a girl?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue grinned silently. \u201cHow kind of him indeed!\u201d she thought. \u201cUnfortunately, I am very familiar with the surroundings of Jiangnan University. I have no idea how many times I\u2019ve had to tag along as my stupid mom tried to show her workplace off to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, Zhao Youyue did not say this. She had to find a way to tactfully reject him. She could not help but think about Bai Yunshan and thought about going out for lunch with her. Unfortunately, Bai Yunshan was not studying at Jiangnan University. She did study in Jiangnan City, which meant that they could only meet during the weekends.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already have plans tonight,\u201d Zhao Youyue said, almost casually.</p><br/><p>Cao Chuanguang knew that it was an excuse. He did not even think that he was too eager or impatient. On the contrary, he wasn\u2019t pushing her hard enough. How could someone be afraid of rejection when picking up a girl? He must press on!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Who is it, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA very good friend of mine from high school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person must be a girl. Come on, invite her too! The more, the merrier!\u201d Cao Chuanguang did not drop a beat.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s smile finally faded. What kind of President of a Newspaper Club would be so ignorant? Does this guy even know how to talk to a girl? She was going to meet her close friend, but this stranger had the gall to invite himself?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had been neutral about Cao Chuanguang. She had seen through his ulterior motives, but far too many boys had already shown their interest in here. Only weird talented authors like Han Leng and Du Hang could remain unmoved. They probably loved their own creations more than actual three-dimensional girls. Naturally, Zhao Youyue was quite skilled at dealing with these suitors. Basically, she could ward them off, without embarrassing or offending them.</p><br/><p>She had never met such a stubborn bull, not during her high school days. She did not expect to bump into one, right here.</p><br/><p>Congratulations, Cao Chuanguang you have earned the Lady\u2019s ire. She happened to glance at Han Leng who was staring blankly at them, as if he was trying to hide a smile. She then said, \u201cMy friend is not a girl \u2013 he\u2019s a guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Zhao Youyue said that, she made sure to show a remorseful, shy expression. She looked like a girl who was in love. Of course, that was just an act.</p><br/><p>Cao Chuanguang was disheartened. A male high school friend? If that was true, this had to be more than a regular friendship, right?</p><br/><p>Cao Chuanguang could not believe this brutal truth. He blurted out, \u201cThat is impossible. That has to be an excuse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng sensed danger coming and quickly turned to leave. It was too late. Lady Zhao\u2019s finger was already directed at him. He felt like a dog being tugged by a leash. Softly, gently, she said, \u201cOf course it\u2019s not an excuse. Han Leng is my high school friend. Yea, it\u2019s Han Leng, possibly the most popular freshman of the year. He is my friend, and I am his most loyal fan! He was the one who invited me. I could not reject my idol at all \u2013 I worship him so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng froze, a chill running down his core. He was shocked. Bloody shameless Lady!</p><br/><p>That was one of the most elaborately crafted excuses ever! She sure works light on her feet!</p><br/><p>Loyal fan?</p><br/><p>Worshipped idol?</p><br/><p>Is that why you forced me to cross-dress?</p><br/><p>Are you that sort of fanatical fan who would sacrifice your idol to the Gods!</p><br/><p>Han Leng started fuming and silently cursed Lady Zhao. Even so, the facts could not be denied. Zhao Youyue had indeed spent quite some money on Han Leng. If Han Leng had continued writing web novels, who knows, Lady Zhao could even be his Golden Sect Master for fun. It would be just like how she held Su Li up.</p><br/><p>Lady \u2018Youyue\u2019 was a rather big name in that industry. Many Qidian readers had even teased her, asking if she had a \u2018nouveau riche [1] system.\u2019 She would fulfill quotas every single day \u2013 achieving a Silver Sect Master status was as easy as eating and drinking water. A Golden Sect Master status would not be any more difficult. It only lay in her decision of doing so.</p><br/><p>\u2018Youyue\u2019s\u2019 identity had never been revealed. They could not associate her with \u2018Ah Yu\u2019 at all. The web novel circle is just a small circle. Only experienced authors and readers would know about her, but the vast majority of web novel readers who did not pay any attention to the fan rankings, comments section or readers group would not even know who she was. They might even think that she was a marketing stunt. If not, which tycoon would actually spend tens of thousands for a tip? Come on, stop joking!</p><br/><p>It was the time to use the sentence, \u2018poverty had limited their imagination.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Han Leng continued cursing silently, his body could not help but walk towards Zhao Youyue. He had a cold expression on his face which made him look just like an idol. Then, he faintly said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, she already has a date.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Chuanguang then saw that Han Leng was also wearing the military training uniform, and could not help but say bitterly, \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in training?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sick,\u201d Han Leng shot back, his face cold and aloof as ever.</p><br/><p>At least act like you\u2019re sick!</p><br/><p>Cao Chuanguang thought about Han Leng\u2019s reputation and status and shuddered. He coughed dryly and decided to retreat first. His mind started to work on smearing Han Leng\u2019s reputation. Even Zhao Youyue had been driven out of his mind. He had transferred all of his attention, his hatred towards Han Leng\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cnouveau rich\u201d () are people who have recently acquired wealth, typically those perceived as ostentatious or lacking in good taste.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It was considered as above average, but still as she was not a top student, nobody would remember her name.</p><br/><p>In some group activities, for example Autumn Sports Day or New Year\u2019s Party, Zhao Youyue would end up as a spectator as before. What she did was to stand at the edge shouting \u201cGood job!\u201d to the highly skilled \u201cGods of Sports\u201d.</p><br/><p>Then, for the competitions of different study subjects, obviously Zhao Youyue never gave a thought of joining any of them. She felt that she was not even in the same dimension with those godly contestants. She did peeked on the questions from her ex-deskmate Zhou Fang previously and they were insane!</p><br/><p>Zhou Fang took the Chemistry competition, it was said that she would join the group training for every first lesson during the late self study. That was why a top scholar like Zhou Fang would spend every second in her spare time for homework, or else she would not finish them on time. She did not had the luxury just like Zhao Youyue who loafed around.</p><br/><p>Actually, in Zhao Youyue\u2019s original plans, she wanted to improve her results by studying through \u201cXu Jing\u201d in the manga world. At least by spending a semester, she could have fought her way up to the top five in class, but unfortunately\u2026</p><br/><p>It was all Su Li\u2019s fault, forcefully abusing Xu Jing on \u201cPure Romance\u201d. Although she remained studious, but after all, Xu Jing herself was not a genius and having her multitasking greatly reduced the efficiency of her studies.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Zhao Youyue ended up screwing every single thing, which brought Xu Jing to the darkside and fall deeply in love with Yang Xixi. Love, happens to be the worst enemy of studies at all times. It is true that there are some who could do puppy love and maintain their results at the same time. However, the truth is that most puppy love causes the results to go down the slope. That was why the school prohibits puppy love.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was considered to have tasted unrequited love in the manga world. That was truly heart aching and this also influenced her in reality. Now, she thought that love was nothing good, and she should stay as far as possible away from it.</p><br/><p>If you expect nothing, then you can never be disappointed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not achieved her initial goal through Xu Jing, but either way her results did improve a little. Moreover, she always made it appear as if she was putting effort in her studies in front of the teachers. This was why the teachers had good impression on her. They had never knew that, when they were away, she could not hold back and would start playing with her phone.</p><br/><p>She was a total phone addict, it was as if the phone was her soul. Without holding her phone, Zhao Youyue would feel extremely anxious, as if this would take her life away.</p><br/><p>Basically, Zhao Youyue completed the difficult questions in her homework by looking up for answers through the web. To her, pondering all by herself was painful and time wasting.</p><br/><p>Actually, if it were not for her results which was steadily on the line, the fact that she never attended the late self study would have gotten her summoned by Mr. Qiu to have some heart-to-heart-talk. Of course, getting her to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d join the late self study. Then, her weekends would not be unrestrained anymore. For others, it was just a four-hour break, but she could return home straight away and only reappear next Monday for class.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was considered a playful person. She felt like school was a place that would torture students by shortening both of their weekends into only a few hours. For her, examination-oriented education was really tiresome, it was basically destroying the specialty and creativity of students!</p><br/><p>Although she never had any specialty nor creativity.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the \u201cLack of sense of presence\u201d was considered as her specialty.</p><br/><p>As for creativity, Zhao Youyue did possess that, her creativity in messing up with things were pretty good.</p><br/><p>\u201cYouyue\u201d, the Qidian account belonged to Zhao Youyue slowly gained some fame in Qidian novel and manga website. This was mainly because she would tip a Sect Master whenever she was happy reading the novel or manga. Even \u201cPure Romance\u201d got tipped a Sect Master, this was because she was happy with the fact that everything was going smoothly based on her script for Su Li\u2019s work. Well, 1,000 RMB was just a small amount to a missy like her.</p><br/><p>Besides, under the name of Sect Master, when she revolt against Su Li later on, it would seem more convincing and influential. Now, she could not wait to see how Su Li would face her fan\u2019s reaction when they finished reading the finale.</p><br/><p>Sadly, it was still Monday and the finale for \u201cPure Romance\u201d will only be published in \u201cWind Manga\u201d during this weekend, while the semester final exams will be held next Tuesday. After reading the finale of \u201cPure Romance\u201d, what kind of feeling would the students be in during the final exam next week?</p><br/><p>As far as Zhao Youyue knew, Jiang Chao seemed to be a \u201cPure Romance\u201d loyal fan. But sadly for now, he was not the deskmate of Wang Yang anymore. This was due to the fact that both of them talked too much and finally got separated by Mr. Qiu without mercy.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had a moment of silence for Jiang Chao, she wondered if Jiang Chao would hunt about for Su Li to settle score for this. Perhaps he should be worrying for himself. After knowing that Su Li was a beautiful mangaka, he decided that Su Li was his sole prioritized mangaka. Since then, he started AMWAYing[1] \u201cPure Romance\u201d insanely to the guys in the classroom. The effect was pretty good, after all they were in their puberty. Even if they do not care much about the storyline, it was still very attractive with just the fan services provided in the manga.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao also frequently re-quote the various promises from Su Li to the guys. Promising \u201cthe ending will definitely be a satisfaction\u201d, \u201ceveryone will end up having their felicity\u201d, \u201cI, Su Li, is someone with integrity, a mangaka who respects the readers, how would I ever lie to you guys?\u201d.</p><br/><p>Under Jiang Chao\u2019s influence, a lot of guys started to think that the beautiful mangaka was too kind to her readers, it was rare to find such mangaka with integrity!</p><br/><p>Every single time when Zhao Youyue saw Jiang Chao mentioning Su Li with his eyes shining brightly, she had a feeling that Jiang Chao was doomed. A fan who turned to the darkside is always worse than pure critics.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chao was no more the deskmate of Wang Yang, and the new deskmate of Wang Yang was now named Qiu Pengcheng. He was a top scholar with good results as well as a class representative of a decent personality. However, someone like him seemed rather boring. After class, he would only sit in his place and do his homework quietly, as he needed to attend the physics and mathematics competition training at the first two periods at night.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Wang Yang who was a novel fan certainly suffered from this, as his new deskmate had zero interest in novels and did not even have time to read any novels. The only thing good about him was that Wang Yang did not have to worry about difficult questions which he could not solve. He could \u201crefer\u201d from his deskmate right away.</p><br/><p>Although Qiu Pengcheng was decent, but he was not stingy at all. It was wrong to let Wang Yang \u201crefer\u201d as he liked but he would rather be unselfish enough to prohibit his deskmate from getting some \u201creferences\u201d. Furthermore, he did not have time to explain till Wang Yang understood, not to mention that the willingness to listen was also a prime concern. That was why he let it slip through his mind and directly provided his homework as \u201creference\u201d, indirectly carrying out some good deeds at the same time.</p><br/><p>Actually, Zhao Youyue\u2019s deskmate had changed too.</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u2013 AMWAY (a multi-level marketing company focusing on healthcare, beauty and home care)</p><br/><p>A substitute word for \u201chard selling\u201d. In China, some people aggressively hard sell the products of AMWAY or recruit members which created a bad impression on the brand.</p>\n</div>"}

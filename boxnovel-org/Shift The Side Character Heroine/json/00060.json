Interest-wise, she had little almost to none in this genre. However, as she read on, she could not stop herself from continuing reading this piece. She caught up to the latest update in just a day, how she wished the author could update the latest chapter quicker, this novel had no less than 400,000 words!</p><br/><p>Without any delay, Zhao Youyue tipped the author and realized there were already seven Sect Masters who tipped the author earlier on. Even though the current novel was not as popular as the previous titles that featuring \u201cLoL\u201d, it was more than enough to maintain a steady flow of income to the author, at least a few 10,000 RMB.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Rosemary wanted to forge a new path with this latest novel, \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d. In order to produce a quality intellectual property, the author had to give up on \u201cLoL\u201d and created an original game, so that he could have a chance to work with the big shots.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were some downsides too. The author had a low profile, and the novel did not have a great start. The author never had any social interaction with the fans, not asking for votes and not even rigging the ballot. This had caused \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d to be in its current state, not too bad nor popular either.</p><br/><p>The ballot rigging phenomenon are common on internet these days. The weekly and monthly top ten novels were there not because of their potential, but through countless of ballot riggers online. Those who made it up there without help would get pushed down after a day, or even in hours. Experienced readers would known that the real deal would rank in between 11 to 30. Unless the top rank had an obvious gap compared to other novels, otherwise it would most likely to be a fake. Even famous authors would cheat their way to the top with money, when their latest works were not even as good as the previous title. It would be more than enough for fresh new readers to take the bait and start reading those top-ranked books.</p><br/><p>Due to the high numbers of ballot riggers, Rosemary\u2019s latest novel \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d could not make it to the top ten, this affected the author greatly as new readers would not be able to see his work at the main page. The author had a great mental stability though, despite all of this that happened. He constantly maintain to upload 6,000 words everyday at 5:00 PM sharp, no more or less.</p><br/><p>This low profile and mysterious author often got mistaken as a female author, due to his pen name \u201cRosemary\u201d of course. His sentences were beautiful and the way he described a male character were scrupulous, the fans always thought of him as a female, some fans had even perceived him as their imaginary goddess. It was not easy to write about gaming novel which is a minority genre, to make it harder when there were mostly male readers. Luckily, his fans were generous enough to tip him, If he decided to create a green alliance to ask for votes like what the other famous author were doing, that would surely be an impetus. After all, some fans would not vote for the novel they liked if the authors themselves never asked for it\u2026</p><br/><p>At long last, Rosemary came to realization that in the comment section, there were a lot of fans mistaking him as a female author. He then quickly clarified that he was indeed a male author, not any \u201cliterary young girl\u201d. He even mocked himself in a joking way that if he was a female author, he would not be this bad in creating female characters and describing romantic scenes.</p><br/><p>This was why Rosemary decided not to include any female characters in this novel, except for those who cheered for the protagonist from the sideline.</p><br/><p>After catching up to the latest issue of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, Zhao Youyue felt that the novel was indeed interesting. Even though the main protagonist \u201cLin Feng\u201d had a common name, but his characteristics were spectacular. Not only that he was smart, and had great leadership in game. Due to his age, he often used his knowledge to make up for his gradually declining skills. Eventually, he felt that he was too old to compete in this field and decided to retire, and that was when he got his golden finger, which allowed him to compete with youngsters, once again!</p><br/><p>What\u2019s best, this novel had no complicated relationships between characters, which totally fit the appetite of Zhao Youyue. After all, being a female reader, she would not like the myriad of Harem manga-s. No wonder that was a saying about Rosemary on Qidian, \u201cThere are three thousand Harem kings on Qidian, but there is only one Rosemary.\u201d</p><br/><p>By right, it should be a great thing for Zhao Youyue to shift into Rosemary\u2019s \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d. After going through the first three titles, Rosemary had grown tremendously in terms of characters describing and story pacing, and his depiction of male characters was even more astounding. \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d might be suppressed by the ballot riggers at first, but following the increase in the total words, it would eventually become a popular works. But whether it could emerge as an icon, that was another story, as luck would be deciding factor. The probability was quite high anyway, and Zhao Youyue could absolutely have a \u201csleeping victory\u201d.</p><br/><p>However, without a female character, she could do nothing at all!</p><br/><p>How could such a wonderful novel have not a single female characters, at least the author could put in some side female characters for Zhao Youyue to possess\u2026</p><br/><p>So, Zhao Youyue decided to find out the reason behind all of these, she began to read the previous novels of Rosemary. After eight days, Zhao Youyue finally understood why. All the female characters in his previous novels were at sixes and sevens! They either had very little sense of presence, or were terrible at romantic scenes, some of them were just\u2026 dumbs. Zhao Youyue actually felt sorry for all those female characters.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Rosemary had no talents in creating a female character, as if he did not understand women at all. The romantic scenes that he wrote about, it just felt out of sync!</p>\n</div>"}

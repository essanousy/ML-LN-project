Finding her in a Gwent deck would not be much of a surprise. She was a hero card with seven battle points, even possessing an extra \u201cmedic\u201d skill, which allowed the player to choose one card from their discarded pile and play it instantly. This was a reasonably practical skill in Gwent.</p><br/><p>With such a precious and rare neutral card, usage was mandatory.</p><br/><p>Her quote was as so \u2014- \u2014- \u201cYennefer of Vengerberg, raven-haired, clad in black and white, the first thing you would think of on a December morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yennefer was known for her beauty. She always dressed in black and white, producing a fragrant, lilac and gooseberry scent. Most impressive of all were her violet eyes, raven-black hair, and the black marigold with a star made of obsidian that sparkled from a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it that hung on her neck. There were beauty marks just below the left corner of her lips and on her cheeks. It must have something to do with her quarter-elf blood.</p><br/><p>Yennefer had participated in The Battle of Sodden Hill with her friend Triss Merigold. She lived through it but Fringilla Vigo had ruined her eyes. Eventually, she underwent treatment to restore her vision.</p><br/><p>Geralt had already contacted Yennefer two years ago. He had written loads about his newly adopted daughters Cirilla and Olivia, but got no response.</p><br/><p>This had left Geralt somewhat disappointed and anxious. Geralt may have had several flings with various sorceresses, Yennefer was his one true love. Of course, Yennefer also loved Geralt just as much.</p><br/><p>However, women were always the more tsundere of the pair. As she had only found herself attached to Geralt because of a djinn, Yennefer had, many a time, tried to lift the magic of the djinn to verify if their love was truly genuine. Women \u2014 so fickle. They would never leave their partners alone without asking the question \u2014- \u2014- Do you really love me?</p><br/><p>Their love was genuine \u2014 no double-checking needed, yet there they were, constantly checking on their men. That verbal affirmation was the final nail in the coffin.</p><br/><p>These djinn were powerful air elementals, power of the elements manifested into form and personality \u2014 the latter usually nasty.</p><br/><p>Djinns were born from the legends of \u201cgenies.\u201d The type that granted wishes once rubbed out of their lamps.</p><br/><p>According to legend, djinns could grant even the most far-fetched of wishes, though they did so very begrudgingly.</p><br/><p>Unusually powerful mages could capture and tame these beings. The mages could then draw on its energy, using it to cast spells without having to call on the Power via conventional means.</p><br/><p>Only a sparse handful have managed this feat. Naturally, djinns would doggedly fight to avoid such fates. To imprison a djinn and bend it to one\u2019s will, one must first weaken it \u2014 and that was no easy feat.</p><br/><p>They could fire off a volley of spells in an instant \u2014 something that the most accomplished of human mages could never cast with years of preparation.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, they could manipulate their element \u2014 this case being air, and summon powerful storms, hurricanes, and gales.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, as magical beings, they were vulnerable to silver \u2013 yet steel would do them no harm.</p><br/><p>Of course, Olivia had done her homework on djinns. Now that she was rich and powerful, she had even established her own group of mercenaries and issued them the task of finding a djinn. She intended to capture a djinn and do some research on it.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yennefer still loved Geralt. Her eyes were the only reason she had yet to reply to Geralt. She cared a fair bit about her looks, so why would she display a less than perfect side to Geralt?</p><br/><p>At the same time, Yennefer was also actively looking for ways to have children with Geralt. She easily got jealous, so when she saw that Geralt had already taken a step forward by adopting two daughters, she felt as if she had been tossed aside. Had she not already told Geralt that she would bear his children? Why would that oaf adopt two new daughters now? Was he ridiculing her for her barren womb?</p><br/><p>Yennefer was just as eccentric as any other sorceress. She now eyed Geralt\u2019s two foster daughters with enmity. To them, they were temporary stand-ins for her future children.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yennefer really cared about Geralt. No matter what he did, it would set her mind racing. Of course, she was overthinking it. That simple witcher never did anything in a roundabout fashion.</p><br/><p>Geralt loved Yennefer. He knew how eager she was to have children for him. However, as they were a doubly infertile pairing of a sorceress and a witcher, there was no way that it could be done. If so, they could just treat Cirilla and Olivia as their biological children. If he had Yennefer as the foster mother of these two princesses, would her problems not be solved?</p><br/><p>In the letter written to Yennefer, Geralt had elaborated on how brilliant Cirilla and Olivia were. Cirilla was as brave, courageous, and upright like he was. On the other, Olivia was as beautiful, charming, mysterious and elegant as Yennefer. She was highly talented as a sorceress, not in terms of blood energy, but her profound knowledge that was not in accordance with her age.</p><br/><p>Geralt added on that Kaer Morhen was now no longer the empty, desolate ruin that once was. Well-paved roads that connected Kaer Morhen to many other prosperous cities had been laid out. Kaer Morhen was now practically a trade center. Many businesses have converged, where they would ensure that Kaer Morhen\u2019s produces made it to every corner of the world. Several sorceresses who graduated from the famous Sorceress Academy of Aretuza have also chosen to settle down in Kaer Morhen. There, they were treated with the utmost dignity and honor.</p><br/><p>Of course, the representative of sorceresses would be Triss. She had not yet resigned from her position as a royal court mage in Temeria. However, as she lingered on in Kaer Morhen, slowly and subtly, she actually found herself enjoying herself\u2026</p><br/><p>On the peripheries of Kaer Morhen, refugees who have displaced by the war started turning up. They settled down and built villages, but they would not be content until they became official residents of the city Olivia had personally designed. It was probably the fairest, neatest and the most beautiful city in the entire continent. Many people could not believe that this city was built around the Kaer Morhen castle in just three years. They could only assume that black technology like magic was used in the construction of infrastructural facilities.</p><br/><p>Conventionally, the magic of sorcerers were used for nothing but battle and destruction.</p><br/><p>When her eyes finally healed, Yennefer did not give a moment\u2019s pause before rushing out to see the new Kaer Morhen. She also dearly missed Geralt. At the same time, she wanted to see whether Geralt\u2019s two foster daughters were worthy of her approval.</p></div>\n</div>"}

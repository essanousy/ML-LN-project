You do not hate me?\u201d Du Hang was shocked. He had complained about girls in front of Zhao Youyue, and even treated her starting the conversation as unworthy, but he still had not earned her ire.</p><br/><p>Du Hang tilted his head to glance at Zhao Youyue, yet the signs of a fake polite smile could not be seen. He had no idea how could a fake smile appear so genuine \u2013 normal people would never be able to tell. They would think that she was the most genuine, kindest, warmest person ever.</p><br/><p>The look on Zhao Youyue\u2019s face was one of intelligent coldness, saying \u201cI do not hate you,\u201d those were her true feelings \u2013 and nothing of it indicated her pretentious aloofness.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue knew just how to deal with just about any character out there \u2013 she knew what to say, and who to say it to.</p><br/><p>Du Hang took a blow to the heart, but quickly filled his mind with cynical, self-abusive thoughts. Was he actually a masochist? A beautiful maiden starting a conversation with a kind smile would not excite him, but looking at Zhao Youyue\u2019s cold expression showed an elegant indifference. Somehow he thought that it was the most beautiful expression she could ever make.</p><br/><p>He had to be insane!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not hate me? That is unwise. Fortunately, people have not yet identified me as the resident lurch, or your actions would appear stupid to the passerby. So, please do not get yourself dragged into the hellish swamp with me. Just flash a smile here and there as you are so adept at!\u201d Du Hang said, struggling to maintain his composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, maintaining a smile is very tiring. I act according to whom I\u2019m speaking to. For someone like you, I chose such an approach. So, was it effective?\u201d Zhao Youyue immediately flashed a brilliant smile as she uttered the last sentence, like one of those face-swapping mask performers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought. I saw that coming. So you still hate me, right? It\u2019s all the same to me,\u201d Du Hang tried to keep his impassive mask on.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy hiding one\u2019s thoughts, a person would be able to sweet-talk others, according to how they like it while settling matters. The entire world does this. It is the same as an elite scholar topping the charts in terms of grades, only to laugh it off and tell others that it was just coincidence; like a bishoujo surrounded by a batch of average-looking girls complaining about how they\u2019re gaining weight, popping acne and all that to make themselves look ugly. High standards demand high expectations, and that produces high stress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Hang continued rambling on and went off the rails on his ideologies, trying his best to hide his surprise. He did not expect a regular to be capable of such masquerading.</p><br/><p>He forced himself to remain uninterested, even if it went against his own ideals about transparency and blunt honesty. He hated himself for doing so. Does one have to lie to oneself before learning of the truth?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, Du Sensei. Enough with the philosophy! Let us talk about something much relaxing and interesting, shall we? Who do you think the most beautiful girl in our class is?\u201d This was Zhao Youyue asking a magic mirror.</p><br/><p>Mirror Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? [1]</p><br/><p>Other men would go with the flow, flattering Zhao Youyue, as the bishoujo had asked the question herself. It was a subtle move, but it would increase her favorability, would it not?</p><br/><p>Du Hang remained himself and picked the unpopular route, as always. He probably thought that he was talking to another guy, and this was a men-only discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlondie looked pretty good. Or at least, she knows just how to throw herself into the strike zone of most males,\u201d Du Hang said.</p><br/><p>A more accurate description would be \u2013 she attracted the most attention, even if she was not the most natural.</p><br/><p>\u201cOho! She\u2019s my roomie! Her name is He Weiwei. Wanna get closer to her? I\u2019m here to help!\u201d Zhao Youyue smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already know my answer, so why ask? This world is not short of beauties. If I\u2019m to introduce myself to a beauty everytime I see one, are you asking me to get the contact numbers of every beauty in the world? I am not interested in interacting with girls. Most of them are just too good at hiding their true selves. They\u2019re torturing themselves; they\u2019re torturing their victims, they\u2019re torturing their best friends who happen to be just as good at torturing. Girls are cunning tricky beings that know how to make use of their beauty. They\u2019ve been doing that since the start of time. They would always search for the ideal vantage points, picking off their victims without getting within range. Such intelligence is dumb. Eventually, they would come to their senses, only to see how much of their true selves have left them. In the end, the material wealth their beauty has earned them would save them from that damning revelation yet the materialistic payback will help provide them with mental support, yet that is all still materialistic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had almost solved the Du Hang puzzle, and it had barely taken her any effort. He did not seem to be a man of words, but when the right buttons are pressed, he could rail on forever. The only issue was his inability of finding an outlet, or a kindred spirit who shared his wisdom. Having no fixed target, he had resorted to indiscriminately shotgunning his words about whenever the opportunity presented itself, regardless of how his targets felt about it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue suddenly recalled something and took out her phone to browse through her photos. Of course, she was not looking for her own photos, despite her love of taking selfies. Her selfies were so beautiful that everyone in the class would not believe that it was her.</p><br/><p>There was no need to start a fight over her selfies. Her bad habits were re-emerging, thus she quickly retrieved Han Leng\u2019s cross-dressing album \u2013 which was no less in terms of beauty.</p><br/><p>She showed the pictures to Du Hang, gleefully saying, \u201cI think the most beautiful lady in our class is him, Little Angel Ah Leng! Oh right! You\u2019re dormmates, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Hang.exe crashed when he saw Han Leng\u2019s ultimate cross-dressing. He stared blankly at the picture, enjoying it for some time before waking from his trance, the philosophy long fled from his mind, replaced by male hormones-</p><br/><p>OH MY GOD! THERE\u2019S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GUY IN THIS WORLD? HE MUST BE AN ANGEL!</p><br/><p>Then, he thought of Han Leng\u2019s talented writing. His random scribbles were enough to grace the earth with beautiful poetic writing.</p><br/><p>The \u201cphilosophies\u201d he wrote was child\u2019s play compared to Leng Zi\u2019s writing. His philosophy may be well-written, but the word count was enough to send readers puking.</p><br/><p>Du Hang liked his writing, but he could not deny that Leng Zi was a genius.</p><br/><p>Du Hang had heard of Han Leng\u2019s beauty as a cross-dresser over the internet, but had dismissed most of it as rumors. He had never thought that they were true. This was a freaking beauty! Du Hang\u2019s shell broke down. He could no longer remain lurching about!</p><br/><p>Translation Notes:</p><br/><p>[1] The magic spell used to activate the magic mirror from Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs</p><br/>\n</div>"}

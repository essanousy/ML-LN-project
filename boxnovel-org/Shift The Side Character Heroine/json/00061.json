The bond between the male characters and the way they worked together to fight stronger opponents were touching, not to mention that the tournaments were exciting as well! Many fans had believed that Rosemary was once a Grand Master in \u201cLoL\u201d, or else he would not be able to write such in-game details, his descriptions were way beyond those of the third-rate authors who had probably just watched some \u201cLoL\u201d battles.</p><br/><p>Rosemary would be bombarded with tons of complaints once he started to include female characters or describe a romantic scene in his novel. It was almost like \u201cThe Bloodline of Knights\u201d, of which the other aspects were great except the erotic scenes. Thus the fans had prompted the author to remove any erotic scenes from \u201cThe Bloodline of Knights\u201d, as it would still be a great book without them. Same happened for Rosemary, who was asked to remove all romantic scenes between men and women\u2026</p><br/><p>His first novel was trying to go with the mainstream, thus having female characters like teachers, nurses, stewardess, and even rich girls appearing out of nowhere, obviously heading towards a harem route. He ended up with so many complaints and had to scrap that idea. Some readers had even commented sarcastically that the hero should just be together with his teammates.</p><br/><p>After learning a lesson from his first novel, he meticulously designed three female characters in second, looking to pay tribute to his favorite Esports novel of Starcraft, \u201cRogue Master\u201d, but it ended up suffering another stream of invective from the readers. In the end of story, the hero was again together with this best friend (male), while all the female characters had disappeared.</p><br/><p>While writing his third novel, Rosemary had come to realization that he was destined to write a novel with only one main female character. He thus modelled the character after his first love since high school, it was none other than his beloved wife. Before the fans could bash his works, this lady who had been his loyal reader, as well as his all-time gaming partner who shared the same passion with him for LoL, abruptly stood against this very idea, \u201cDo you want me to be criticized by all your readers? Just\u2026 stop writing any female characters, if you still wanna be my husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rosemary and his wife were deeply in love, they started dating each other since high school, they had even skipped class together to play in a cyber cafe. After graduating from university, they started to live under the same roof and got married. The pen name \u201cRosemary\u201d was his wife\u2019s idea too. As even his lover opposed his idea, he had no choice but to cut down major scenes of this heroine. Her appearance was next to nothing now, like the novel had suddenly lost its heroine. His third novel ended up being the best among the three, acquiring more than 10,000 average subscriptions. This made him one of the successful authors within this genre. Besides, He was lucky enough to be invited as a VIP guest to the TGC event.</p><br/><p>In his fourth novel, \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d that he had prepared the most, he totally ditched the idea of inserting anymore female character. He even went out of his way to write about a whole new original game, \u201cEternal War\u201d. He would rather spend tremendous effort in describing the iconic game setting than wasting another drop of his ink in depicting a female character.</p><br/><p>He finally acknowledged that he had to stop adding female characters into his novel in order to be successful. Probably because he and his wife had been a perfect couple since high school, who had shared the same hobbies and could settle their dispute merely via a solo battle in game.</p><br/><p>Lately, those female characters who appeared to be cute and moe, were mostly written by virgin authors. Due to their inexperience, they had fantasized the erotic scenes to be so impeccable, thus striking a responsive chord among the readers.</p><br/><p>The situation was indeed embarrassing. At first, Zhao Youyue had rejoiced that she was lucky enough to be able to shift into such a wonderful dimension by one godly author. She also liked the way this author portrayed his characters, as if they were alive, with blood and flesh. She had even become a fan of \u201cRosemary\u201d. But, this novel \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d had no female character at all. This made Zhao Youyue speechless.</p><br/><p>Why could she only possess a female character? Zhao Youyue thought that she would be perfectly fine even within a male body, she just had to adjust herself accordingly. Too bad, she could never shift into a male character.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had no other choice but to meet the author in real life, she would ask for a side character, or even a cameo would do, it must be a female though! It did not matter even if she was of a tomboyish personality!</p><br/><p>This was as good as drawing a bishoujo in manga but setting him as a male character.</p><br/><p>Here comes the real problem. Zhao Youyue was not sure whether she could meet up with the author himself. He was clearly different than the previous two authors, \u201cI\u2019m the Best\u201d and \u201cSu Li\u201d who had little to no fame at all, he was just one step from becoming famous, one of the big shots. She knew that as time passed on, the novel would surely got its own popularity although there were mostly male readers. Anyway, Zhao Youyue predicted that those Fujoshis would be even more excited when they discovered this novel.</p><br/><p>Their imagination would run wild upon seeing the muscular and passionate male characters in this novel. This reminded Zhao Youyue of a similar novel in the real world, which was \u201cThe King\u2019s Avatar\u201d written by Butterfly Blue. Though \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d had a different writing style and was not as funny as \u201cKing\u2019s Avatar\u201d, yet the hero Lin Feng was not attractive as Ye Xiu, still it had its own charm! The way Rosemary described competition was way more intense and excited, full of emotion too! These two creations certainly had their own selling points.</p><br/><p>In the real world, not only that \u201cThe King\u2019s Avatar\u201d could win so much loves from the Fujoshis, its doujin works and merchandise had attained a huge success too. \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d must also had such a potential! If only she could be granted a female character in it, she would leave no stone unturned to make \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d a great hit as well!</p><br/><p>Why couldn\u2019t Rosemary create a female character like what was done by Butterfly Blue? Butterfly Blue could draw both male and female characters. If any female character from \u201cThe King\u2019s Avatar\u201d, like Su Mucheng, Tang Rou, Chu Yunxiu or Chen Guo existed in \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, Zhao Youyue would possess her at once, then enjoying a sleeping victory\u2026</p><br/><p>However, reality does not always accord with one\u2019s wishes.</p>\n</div>"}

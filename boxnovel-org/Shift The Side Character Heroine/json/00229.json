To his surprise, he looked horrible!</p><br/><p>Han Leng never really emphasized on self-grooming. However, he was now the desk mate of Zhao Youyue. Although he only peeped at her from the corner of his eye most of the time, he would still find himself captivated by her beauty.</p><br/><p>One would easily be made aware of her beauty by getting closer to her, because one would ignore her unconsciously if he keeps a distance from her.</p><br/><p>By being his desk mate now, he could not look away from someone that was practically in his face. Moreover, Han Leng was the only one in the class who had seen her performing on stage in an elegant dress. At that moment, he almost thought that Chu Luoxun was possessing her, until she started playing. Otherwise, he would be worried about getting obsessed with the three dimensional Chu Luoxun\u2014Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Also, at this close distance, Han Leng could see her supermodel level skin, it was as close as you get to \u201csnow-white skin\u201d in reality. Her silky, black hair was just as entrancing. She seemed to be in the midst of growing it out.</p><br/><p>Besides that, her school uniform was always clean and emanating a fresh, citrus scent. Whenever Han Leng inhaled this pleasant scent, he would get agitated. Hence, he tried his best to keep a distance from her.</p><br/><p>Han Leng felt that the world was joking with him. He already had \u201ca new sweetheart,\u201d which was Chu Luoxun, and why is he now the desk mate of Zhao Youyue?</p><br/><p>He also found that Zhao Youyue was much more mysterious and exceptional than what he had imagined. She was inconceivable</p><br/><p>Well, he could only become more deeply in love with Chu Luoxun, who was living in his literary world. By this, only could he guard himself against the evil forces of Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>Honestly, this was the first time that Han Leng thought of grooming himself being \u201cattacked\u201d by Zhao Youyue beautiful face from near. He would feel uncomfortable if he does not do so, otherwise he would remain as the leaf beneath her rose petals!</p><br/><p>Luckily, his body was not giving out any unpleasant odors. He never skips his baths or laundry. Since he was her desk mate now, he must pay attention to his appearance so that he would no longer look like a mess</p><br/><p>In his heart, he blamed Teacher Qiu again. He missed sitting beside Chen Haoran, his bestie who did not have to care about so many things. Things have changed now, and he must not cause Zhao Youyue to hate him.</p><br/><p>Han Leng would not have thought that, once he has made this decision, that guy who made a living out of his capabilities and talents would someday use his face to do so too.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, how many guys could become the desk mate of an innocent and indifferent girl in their wonderful youth?</p><br/><p>As a person who emphasized on the appearance, Lady Zhao had great taste in matching pairs, choosing the skincare treatment and hairstyle, for both male and female.</p><br/><p>She would not discriminate anybody, unless something crosses her lines. For example, she loved delicious cuisine, and yet, she ate it to merely satisfy her taste buds, not to fill her stomach.</p><br/><p>Therefore, those who valued frugality would think that her princess disease was beyond cure when they see her eating. Likewise, if one makes that sentiment known to her, she would respond similarly.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, the unprejudiced Zhao Youyue would become generous by doing the act of \u201ccommiting to the world\u2019s welfare when you are rich.\u201d Jiang Qing Little Angel had benefited greatly from this when she was her desk mate. Well, if the idiot Han Leng behaves appropriately, he would be rewarded by Lady Zhao, showing him the light.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, she would not simply praise or reward him, knowing that he was practically made out of ego. The last thing she would do would be to tip his work as a friend. Based on what she knew of him, she knew that she must have a concrete speech to compliment his work. Well, as argumentative as a scholar could be, he would not easily be cheated or played the fool.</p><br/><p>She might as well let him live in his own worldshe did not want to get involved in it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue admitted that she was good at tricking others, sometimes, especially men. They would be very flattered when she throws empty praises at them, thinking that she had \u201cdiscerning eyes,\u201d compared to other girls. So, they would think that she is a kind and understanding girl, and befriend her in turn.</p><br/><p>In truth, these empty complements would be made in passing, like an obligatory ritual of hers.</p><br/><p>Three days after Zhao Youyue won the gold-prize in the provincial violin competition, the news started spreading all over the school!</p><br/><p>This wouldn\u2019t be much, on its own. However, she was already quite popular after gaining recognition as a top student before this, and now with this hefty gold prize, it was natural for her to become the center of attention instantly!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was soon appointed by the headmaster to give a speech on next week\u2019s flag-raising ceremony. She was now fully qualified to be a representative of the top students.</p><br/><p>However, this only annoyed her. Of course, this still gave her a sense of achievement. In fact, this was why she had been working so hard to make herself outstanding, so that she would be noticed by others, and become the center of attention</p><br/><p>She deserved all of this.</p><br/><p>What annoyed her was that she had to prepare the speech draft, and her writing sucked. It would be a misanthropic speech if she activates the \u201cYu Shengfan Card.\u201d Perhaps, halfway through the speech, the headmaster would get pissed off and drive her off the stage.</p><br/><p>As such, she thought of solving this problem by using money again!</p><br/><p>As long as the problem can be solved by using the money, it would not be a problem at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Great Scholar Han, help me prepare a speech draft, three hundred RMB for one thousand words, deal?\u201d she asked Han Leng, while placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhao Youyue knew how to take advantage of Han Leng. Should she cultivate him into her personal scholar?</p><br/><p>He would be able to write according to her demands. That would be awesome, right?</p><br/><p>Han Leng was startled, and practically hugged the wall again, how could she touch him after three days of becoming his deskmate!</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t she know that it is improper for a man and woman to touch each other without a valid reason?</p><br/><p>By acting elegantly indifferent, Han Leng wrote on his draft paper: \u201cI refuse to do so!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he showed his draft paper to Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you really lost your tongue? You haven\u2019t spoken a word for the past three days, and have just expressed yourself in written words!\u201d Zhao Youyue stared at the lunatic before her eyes and raised the stakes, \u201cHow about five hundred RMB? Deal?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

However, she did not inquire about the whatsoever Military Demarcation Line. She would sit as she liked.</p><br/><p>Who would be mindful of that line all the time?</p><br/><p>She was not a primary school student anymore. Moreover, Han Leng was huddling up so far away from her, which left a big space in between them. So, why couldn\u2019t she use the space flexibly?</p><br/><p>After seeing her removing her elbow from that line, Han Leng felt relieved and restored his state of elegant indifference. He despised Teacher Qiu now. There would be only endless awkwardness by sitting together with Zhao Youyue, as she gave him endless guilt.</p><br/><p>There is a statement that says one will like your appearance, but will begin to detest you once they know your true colors by claiming that you are different than what he has imagined. The truth is, you never changed, and yet, you are being disgraced for something that you never committed.</p><br/><p>He would feel like an idiot, every time he recalls the self-delusion and satisfaction that he had submerged himself in before. He had even written a fictional character that was based on Zhao Youyue. Nonetheless, the more he knew about her, the more he felt that she was nothing like her!</p><br/><p>There was nothing that he could complain about the real Zhao Youyue. Instead, he felt that she had lain low, extremely low. It was either her face or her talent that was far more excellent than what he had imagined. He truly felt that the more he learned about her, the more he would be slapped in the face. Ironically, there was once a time when he would secretly belittle her, thinking that she was nothing</p><br/><p>That was the time when he was obsessed with \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d It was also the phase where his understanding of Zhao Youyue was wholly based on his fantasy.</p><br/><p>After that, he began to calm down. When he could normally chat with Zhao Youyue via Wechat, he realized how stupid and wrong he was.</p><br/><p>Finally, Teacher Qiu, their class teacher, entered the classroom. He straight away asked Zhao Youyue and Han Leng to meet him outside the classroom. He wanted to explain to her about the seating arrangement, hoping that she would accept his good intentions.</p><br/><p>He hoped that the both of them would help each other in their studying, whereby Zhao Youyue could learn how to write a full mark essay from Han Leng, while Han Leng adopts the hardworking attitude from her. Any questions, and he may ask Zhao Youyue, the top student</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, as indifferent as usual, did not make any objections. She knew that she was unable to help Jiang Qing in improving her results, even if she got her to be her deskmate once again. She would only make things worst.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Han Leng was the best novelist of Qidian. He could still make a living if he quits school and starts writing novels now. Results were nothing for him to worry about.</p><br/><p>Of course, she would try her best to help him if he needs it. But, she did not think that he would take the initiative to ask her anything as he seemed to want nothing more than to keep himself 10 meters away from her.</p><br/><p>That was it. Both of them became desk mates.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was slightly bored. After all, Jiang Qing Little Angel, who used to talk to her, was not sitting beside her anymore. She had been replaced by a quiet and aloof hipster. Well, this was what it seemed to be on the surface, as he had a funny side, but, he did not want to show it now as if he has decided to become a tranquil, immortal practitioner.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Zhao Youyue occupied herself by playing with the phone, completely ignoring him. After all, she was used to entertaining herself.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was focusing on his work and had sat up properly. His mind started to conceptualize the plot of \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d He used to write his work during the self-learning session, but he could no longer do so. If Zhao Youyue ever discovers it, his identity as \u201cLeng Zi\u201d would be revealed, right?</p><br/><p>Thus, only a fine outline would be written when he is in classroom, to the extent of the male protagonist and the heroine, of course. In the case of Chu Luoxun, he would write it according to Zhao Youyue\u2019s suggestion\u2014and write it according to his feelings.</p><br/><p>What Han Leng liked the most about Zhao Youyue was her impeccable behavior as a fan of a work. Sometimes, he envied \u201cLeng Zi\u201d because she was very supportive of \u201cLeng Zi\u201d. She would send a red packet, even when mutual agreement on something was unattainable</p><br/><p>Those hefty amounts of red packets were the reason he increasingly valued her opinions. Although the juvenile novel was not as commercialized as a web novel, fundamentally, it was still commercialized literature. Moreover, Han Leng was very experienced in the field of web articles, which was why he could not resist the money from Lady Zhao.</p><br/><p>On top of that, he fully accepted her opinions, due to his guilt of misjudging her.</p><br/><p>Today was Sunday, in other words, it was self-learning session for the entire day. Suddenly, Han Leng felt the urge to pee after the first session. He wanted to go to the washroom, but, there was a \u201ctiger\u201d blocking his way!</p><br/><p>Should he pat her shoulder to ask her to make way for him?</p><br/><p>No way!</p><br/><p>He would be electrocuted once he touches her. He thought this out, all of a sudden. If this is to happen in an anime, his bones would be seen through his translucent, frying body.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was unable to speak a word. He felt as if that those words were stuck in his throat!</p><br/><p>Thus, he held it for another session!</p><br/><p>Perhaps others guys would not be as stupid as Han Leng!</p><br/><p>In this crucial moment, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was the one that rescued him, of course!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was the only one who could help him to overcome his fear of Zhao Youyue</p><br/><p>As usual, he did not speak a word but handed over a note to her\u2014Could you make a way? I would like to go out.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue read it. His handwriting was not good, yet, was neatly written. She turned her head, giving an uncomprehensive look at her desk mate who was still sitting properly and elegantly indifferent, wondering why won\u2019t he just say it aloud?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he knew the skill of \u201cspirit of languages,\u201d which would cause misfortune to others after speaking to him excessively? However, he just raised the important issue of the \u201cMilitary Demarcation Line\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not a girl who would intentionally make things difficult for others. She has a good temper as well as one who was very understanding. Hence, she stood up to make way for him.</p><br/><p>After seeing this from the corner of his eye, he almost shouted\u2014I was saved! My throat was unsealed! Lady Zhao, you are indeed a saint, and I almost fell for you!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d is my only favorite!</p><br/><p>Han Leng stood up slowly, and with his extremely aloof expression, he slowly and steadily walked out from the classroom, so that it would not ruin his elegant indifferent style. After making sure that his classmates could not see him, he rushed to the washroom, as he could not hold it any longer!</p>\n</div>"}

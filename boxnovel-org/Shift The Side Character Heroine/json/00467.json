After all, Zhao Youyue had yet to reach in and rearrange the innards of his world. She was obediently clearing \u201cTale of Wuxia 3 \u2013 Swords of The Future\u201d for the first time ever, in the shortest amount of time she could come up with.</p><br/><p>She had done so to familiarize herself with this world, from the plotline, to the various characters inside. In that case, it would be convenient for her to participate and meld into the lore.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhao Youyue truly intended to create a character. She was drop-dead serious about this instance. This work seemed to have great potential, and a culmination that would result in an iconic character was very liable. She even hoped to make an unforgettable plotline to all players, making the entire work to become a Godly masterpiece!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could not deny that she really liked this game, after clearing the game once. This work had a soul and its creators love could be clearly felt through it. It only had the crippling misfortune of being based off the cliche, overused, industrialized Wuxia genre.</p><br/><p>But even so, this game was still very playable. It was quite easy to get addicted to the game.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had a powerful imaginative mind in her own right. If she really creates an iconic character, what kind of ability would she obtain this time? It shouldn\u2019t be a problem for her to master various martial arts.</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, many martial arts within this \u201cTale of Wuxia 3\u201d were restricted to fists and legs. In a Wuxia world, those were considered low-level skills.</p><br/><p>Even if Zhao Youyue sets up herself to be invincible within the game, the greatest martial artists in reality would be downed by a single bullet</p><br/><p>Anyhow, she would still be able to defend herself far better than before, whatever the outcome was. At least she would be able to fight her way out of any unforeseen circumstances.</p><br/><p>Who would expect a pampered Lady of a rich family to have such vigorous skills and movements, especially when it came to tumbling about? And being invincible while doing so?</p><br/><p>That was how the game had been set. Rolling or tumbling gameplays, paired with devastating strikes were a trending pair. Players should never let greed get the better of them and attempt landing some extra hits. Even if one strove to be as reckless and aggressive as humanly possible, there were still some basic laws to follow.</p><br/><p>That night, Zhao Youyue finally entered the literary world of the game through her (sometimes) trusty \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d She immediately saw a fresh face among the female characters that she could possess. She was a gorgeous, righteous Deity.</p><br/><p>This righteous Deity\u2019s name was Yan Qingmeng. She was a female Taoist student. She had almost been fully fleshed out, be it skills or personality, including the upcoming interactions between her and the players.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had some ideas. It looks like this Yan Qingmeng was similar to Ye Honglian from the first DLC. She was probably the heroine within the second DLC, and was raidable. However, based on producer Zha Feng\u2019s unique personality, a good ending was probably impossible. He loved fabricating fancy tragedies. He loved the sound of shattering player\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was already starting to like this Yan Qingmeng. She had been decently set up. However, she did not know why this character strongly reminded her of \u201cShi Feixuan\u201d from \u201cTwin Brothers.\u201d Shi Feixuan was also a righteous Deity. She also fell deeply in love with the protagonist. She could definitely be considered an iconic female character</p><br/><p>In the end, as the Doujinshis about \u201cTwin Brothers\u201d gradually increased, the reputation of Shi Feixuan and her pure, holy clan \u2013 \u201cCihang Jingzhai\u201d had been thoroughly ruined. \u201cCihang Jingzhai\u201d soon became \u201cCihang Brothel.\u201d The evil woman Wan Wan \u201cbeaten\u201d Shi Feixuan up instead, and became the most popular female character among many Doujinshi novels.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, Shi Feixuan and \u201cCihang Jingzhai\u201d garnered much criticism. But the greatest criticism was probably not to give guys a f*ck. Also, she only wanted Li Shimin. Many readers were very dissatisfied about that. They had substituted themselves as Kou Zhong, Xu Ziling. They had the desire to change history as well. In the end, Huang Yi still insisted to keep history unchanged.</p><br/><p>Upon a second glance at Yan Qingmeng\u2019s setup, this character was raising far too many red flags. She kept droning on about benevolence and morality, and to be compassionate towards people. Yet, she made no moves of her own. Knowing this game, players probably had to complete those missions on her behalf, buying her favorability. Even so the rewards did not seem very promising\u2026 Something told her that the players would be discarded as spare tires by a green tea b*tch[1]</p><br/><p>Maybe this was exactly the Deity, Goddess in the producer\u2019s mind?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was now less convinced that Yan Qingmeng would grant her a \u201csleeping victory.\u201d If she directly possessed on this heroine, she might get cheated. She might as well choose an obscure passerby character. She could move more freely, and proceed with the plot in mind, eventually creating an iconic female character.</p><br/><p>Who knows, in a sandbox game, anything might happen, and the popularity of Zhao Youyue\u2019s possessee might gain the opportunity to completely exceed the popularity of the heroine \u2013 Yan Qingmeng. Of course, this character would not be raidable. Players would never be able to obtain her.</p><br/><p>The unattainable treasure was always the best and unforgettable one</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue started to search for a female character who was delegated to a more passerby-like role. Very soon, she found a satisfying passerby character \u2014\u2014 the Princess Su of the Kingdom of Zhao. She did not even have a name. Should she just call her Jane Doe Su?</p><br/><p>This princess was truly a passerby. She had once appeared in the earlier stages of the game. However, players could not even converse with her. This character seemed to be purely created, only to add some substance to the royal members of the Kingdom of Zhao. Her base character model was almost baseline generic</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue chose this Su character because she had a lot of room to play around with. Her identity as a royal princess was almost laughable.</p><br/><p>She directly possessed this \u201cSu character,\u201d who was only a passerby princess. She had a surname, but no name. She started to work on her background. She was the daughter of the tyrant, Su Hu. But her mum was a sword princess who swung her sword for Su Hu, only to pay with her life. She could only watch helplessly as her mum was abused by the tyrant to death. This had cast a great shadow in her young mind. Along with that shadow, the seeds of vengeance had been sown in her heart.</p><br/><p>An iconic character most certainly needed a dark, tragic past. If not, this character would lose its depth</p><br/><p>The passerby Jane Doe Su had a sword as her sole companion. Whether she was afraid, in fear, numb, she chose to entrust all of them onto her \u201cFlying-Rainbow Sword.\u201d She had inherited this relic from her mum.</p><br/><p>She had great potential for swordsmanship, but she could not even fathom the magnitude of what she had taught herself, or if she had even mastered anything. After all, if one could not see the ceiling, or had no gauge to compare oneself to, one would not know how proficient one truly was. One day, she finally relied on her sword skills to leave the palace that had left her countless dark memories.</p><br/><p>Since then, she was no longer Jane Doe Su. She was not willing to even use the surname Su, anymore. She had no name, no past, and had no future. She only had a complete set of sword skills.</p><br/><p>Her sword was the only thing that would never betray her.</p><br/><p>A legend soon made its way throughout the lawless world. There was a nameless wandering swordswoman. She possessed unparalleled swordsmanship that resembled a dance, called \u2014\u2014 \u201cFairy from Wonderland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many people started arguing, whether the \u201cGod of Sword\u201d Li Xiye\u2019s swordsmanship was stronger, or if this nameless wandering swordswoman\u2019s swordsmanship was actually better</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Green tea b*tch \u2013 It refers to the kind of girl who seems to be pure and elegant, having a fluttering long hair, having natural beauty, pretending to be delicate and charming, unharmful, preferring a peaceful life yet encountering lots of sickness and disasters, being very sentimental. But in fact, she\u2019s very scheming, playing with others\u2019 feelings behind the scenes.</p><br/><p>[2] Fairy from Wonderland \u2013 Fairy from the wonderland is a skill from a TV series The Little Fairy which is a 2006 Chinese television series based on the legend of the Fairy Couple during the Han Dynasty.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

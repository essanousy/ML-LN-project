She treated \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d who was not related to her by blood, as her own sister. It so happened that the effort \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 had put into \u2018assisting\u2019 her was even higher than her own biological sister.</p><br/><p>This probably was a juvenile novel, where the whole world was assisting the male protagonist and the heroine.</p><br/><p>Whether Lin Meiyue and Gu Yuan would be able to be sure of their relationship without \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d even the Goddess was not confident about it.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Lin Meiyue brought \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 some comforting goods; they were all her favorite sweets, cakes, chocolate, etc. Then, \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 smiled even brighter, of course, and hugged Lin Meiyue, saying, it was too bad that she was not a man, otherwise, she would marry her!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Lin Meiyue was a very gentle, kind and innocent girl, carrying the most beautiful soul. Unfortunately, she was not good at expressing herself which made her easy to miss.</p><br/><p>\u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 had even warned Gu Yuan to treat her well. If not, she would keep haunting him, even when she becomes a ghost!</p><br/><p>At that moment, she was extremely lively and optimistic. Thus, when Lin Meiyue inquired on her condition, she confidently replied \u201cWell, it is just a general body check-up! I am fine; there is nothing wrong with my body!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Gu Yuan doubted it, for this was already her second \u2018check-up\u2019 within a short span of time. He could not restrain himself and ask, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just go for one not long ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>His meaning was clear. Why would someone go for a body check-up again, in such a short period of time?</p><br/><p>As usual, \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 remained smiling, and said without any hesitation, \u201cThere was nothing unusual before this, so nothing unusual was required. But, there seems to be a problem with my head now, and it looks like I\u2019ll have to stay here for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turns out that she had collapsed on her way to the competition and had bruised her beautiful face and radiant forehead</p><br/><p>The injury was nothing more than a graze. It was not the reason why she lay in bed now, but she had used it to cover up the fact that something far more severe ailed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get tired easily, and I may have overexerted myself a wee bitI will be fine after resting adequately, and you\u2019ll soon see me back in school again!\u201d The energetic voice of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 always made people feel that she is indeed vigorous, if you could look past that hollow, pale face.</p><br/><p>After hearing that, the innocent Lin Meiyue was happy for her, of course. She wished \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 a speedy recovery and hoped to continue learning the violin from her.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Gu Yuan still did not believe her. He felt that her answer had the makings of a pre-prepared speech.</p><br/><p>\u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 was not as nave as Lin Meiyue. She had a keen mind, and she could see through any smokescreen and superficiality with just one look, just like how she noticed that Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue liked each other. Then, with her various forms of assistance and match-making efforts, they finally held each other hands and confirmed their relationship as a couple.</p><br/><p>The Goddess Chu was a girl who completely understood the ways of the world.</p><br/><p>In reality \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 had the same disease as Gu Yuan\u2019s late mother. Her body would slowly become weak; she would not lose her strength to even lift the violin and, she wouldn\u2019t be able to even walk. She would have to remain in a wheelchair</p><br/><p>This was fate. This was karma.</p><br/><p>By this, it perfectly fulfilled the stereotypical drama and structure of a juvenile novel, just like the proverb that goes \u201cwithout coincidences, there can be no stories.\u201d However, would reality ever bear witness to such ridiculous coincidences?</p><br/><p>After Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue left the room, the smile on \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 face disappeared. Giving her smile to the world and other people while leaving the sadness to herself, was already second nature to her.</p><br/><p>Hence, she had written a song named \u201cI Left the Sadness to Myself\u201d according to what she felt\u2014</p><br/><p>I think it\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t gentle enough</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t share my sadness</p><br/><p>Leaving the sadness to my self</p><br/><p>Letting you take off with your beauty</p><br/><p>Thereafter</p><br/><p>I have no reason to be happy anymore</p><br/><p>I think I can bear the sadness</p><br/><p>Pretending that you\u2019ve never entered my life before</p><br/><p>Think of me occasionally</p><br/><p>Can you think of me too</p><br/><p>Can you</p><br/><p>Can you</p><br/><p>Of course, the \u201cyou\u201d referred to the \u201cperformance.\u201d As for a girl who loved music with her life, how sorrowful would it be, to lose the ability to \u201cperform\u201d?</p><br/><p>Leng Zi, the creator, pointed this out after rereading the lyrics in the novel.</p><br/><p>However, the gang of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 would disagree with her explanations. Instead, they would think that this song had been dedicated to Gu Yuan and, \u201cyour beauty\u201d was clearly referring to Lin Meiyue!</p><br/><p>Besides that, \u201cI think it\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t gentle enough\u201d fulfilled the characteristics of \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d She was very optimistic, tough and confident, yet, she seldom portrayed the tenderness of a little girl, creating a distinct contrast between herself and Lin Meiyue, who was careful and gentle. Even Gu Yuan has said before, that the understanding and caring personality of Lin Meiyue attracted him the most.</p><br/><p>These were nowhere to be found in \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 who was careless, mean and vigorous.</p><br/><p>She would always force him to move on without considering his opinions, be it placing him on the stage, or choosing \u201cLiebesleid\u201d for him. If it is Lin Meiyue, she would not have used such assertive methods.</p><br/><p>To be honest, most men would prefer a girl like Lin Meiyue. As for an eye-catching goddess like \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d her tenderness would only exist in music. Along with that, her vulnerability, loneliness, sadness</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, it had been proven that she had allowed a once fallen genius to rise up again, better than he ever was. He was not a pianist who performed according to the music book, but a pianist who could form an intense resonance with the audiences!</p><br/><p>Could this be considered as the tenderness of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019?</p><br/><p>Inside the ward, \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 put down the song that she had completed as the nurse stepped in. Apparently, she was not come to check on her, but to refill the drip. All sorts of medicine were strewn across her tray, indicating that she was going to be damned soon.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the nurse, \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 showed her bright smile again. Even the nurse could not resist her charm. The nurse could only flash her a sad, sorrowful smile. She was feeling absolutely sorry for the fate of this beautiful young girl.</p><br/><p>She did not know that \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 knew how to play the violin, but she knew that \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 could play the guitar. She would sing and play in the garden of the hospital whenever she had the energy; all of which would be her own her songs, each of them as pleasant as she was. One would be lost in the sound of her voice, unknown to time, nor known to self.</p><br/><p>She was unsure when this rapid deterioration begun, but she sure felt like a flower that was slowly withering away, as she did not have the energy to sing anymore. All she could do was to hold a pen and keep writing new songs, while continuing to pursue her love for music in what way she can</p>\n</div>"}

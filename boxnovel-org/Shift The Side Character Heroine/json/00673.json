It looked like she was reading the chapter that had something about stockings and beautiful legs. He could not help it. He was a little perverted in his head and had some preferences towards foot fetish. Therefore, why not humor himself by inserting scenarios about black stockings as he wrote about the main female character\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>His protagonist was a strong goddess-like female character. Put some black stockings on her, and she would be perfect. In his next work, he might write about some loli-type female character, and put some white stockings on her. Then, he would write out some sick and perverted scene about the female character.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren loved writing female-centric novels, simply because he was afraid that he would never find the girl of his dreams. Therefore, he could only live his fantasies out in his writings.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue noticed that Xiao Yiren was just finished with his update. She placed her phone down and flashed one of her artificial, dazzling smiles. She was not embarrassed by it at all. Rather, she was highly experienced in such matters. She would never be affected by the sexual fantasies written in novels by male authors. If anything, she would sometimes criticize their appreciation towards beauty. These girls had no variety. They were always wearing miniskirts and black stockings. There was no creativity at all.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Yiren was a rather creative chap. He could take up an entire chapter, writing about how beautiful legs. All he did was to describe a part of a human body, but it could evoke the fantasies of his male readers. He had some real talent!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren could not stand the ridiculing gaze that Zhao Youyue was giving him. He glanced at Lady Zhao for a moment and quickly averted his gaze. He explained, \u201cFor a web novel to attract readers, I had to throw in some fanservice\u2026 But I am quite shocked that you actually read web novels.\u201d</p><br/><p>What little that Xiao Yiren knew of Zhao Youyue was that she was an \u2018excellent student\u2019 and a \u2018musical genius.\u2019 Thus, he would never associate the \u2018Tycoon Youyue\u2019 with the girl seated right beside him. He had always felt that web novels were a little low class. Thus, someone like Zhao Youyue, a high-class beauty, would never read it.</p><br/><p>That was right. Zhao Youyue was a lady. She could get anything she desired. Why would she use web novels to satisfy her sexual fantasies?</p><br/><p>It was extremely rare for a novel to have a reader that was an ultra-tycoon like Lady Zhao. Other than those Sect Master bot accounts [1], there would be little to no readers like Lady Zhao reading their novels\u2026</p><br/><p>The web novel circle once had a rumor circulating about. It argued that \u2018Tycoon Youyue\u2019 was just a bot account and not a real human being. However, there was no basis to this rumor. After all, Zhao Youyue herself would show up in chat groups, throwing red packets along the way. Naturally, authors would bootlick her.</p><br/><p>Some authors would be especially concerned about Zhao Youyue. They would pay attention to her every movement, hoping to yield at least an opinion from her. Then, they would correct their work according to her liking, so that Lady Zhao would be satisfied with it.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Zhao Youyue did not care much about most of the works, which made her seem indifferent. She would only approach a person if she wanted a cameo appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are so many web novels out there with rich imaginations. Why can\u2019t I read them?\u201d Zhao Youyue asked with a smile on her face. She was always tolerant towards authors, hoping to cook up a good relationship with them. Who knows, she might want day find a use for their work?</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren was speechless for a moment and did not know what to say to her. He felt that he was wrong. Maybe it was because of his origin. He had wanted to enroll in a traditional literature course, hoping to be a true writer. However, the reality was just this cruel. He could only be a web novelist who entertained simple minds. Thus, he subconsciously detested his own works.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not just read your novel. I think it was a pretty good read. It gives off a positive vibe, so I gave you a Sect Master. You should keep it up!\u201d Zhao Youyue said wittily.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren\u2019s head snapped up. It was the first time he had ever gotten so close to such a beautiful girl. However, he did not know why he felt that she was mocking him, even when her every movement seemed so natural. Originally, he did not dare to fantasize about Zhao Youyue. At the same time, he had conflicting feelings about her. If he could have her as his girlfriend, wouldn\u2019t he be happy? Wouldn\u2019t every other guy in the world be jealous of him?</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Yiren was just too shy. Perhaps, he instinctively imagined himself getting rejected, in the face of a confident, energetic Zhao Youyue. She also came from a wealthy background. Maybe this was a legendary male chauvinist. He would not want to get close to girls that he could not control.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren opened his phone app again. As expected, he found a notification on his bar. Tycoon Youyue had given him 100,000 points, which was equivalent to RMB 1,000. To Zhao Youyue, it was pocket change.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren was not short of money as well. However, he was not earning nearly enough to support himself. He did not want to rely on his family, as that gave them a right to control him. He wanted to be the master of his own future. If he did not succeed in being a web novelist, then he might have to go back home and inherit his unimpressive family business\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, an ordinary person might not even have such a family business, even if they worked hard their entire life.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren would rather be called a web novelist. He did not want others to call him \u2018someone\u2019s son.\u2019 Maybe this was the so-called scholar\u2019s pride. It was a virtue. If interpreted differently, it could also be the arrogance of a scholar.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you, you are Tycoon Youyue! The Tycoon Youyue who gives out Silver Sect Master points as if it was Sect Master points? If I remember clearly, you gave out a few Golden Sect Masters as well. You must be the person who gave out the Golden Sect Master to \u201cSave me Queen!\u201d recently!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yiren was shocked. He had never imagined that he was dining with the first person to be called a tycoon in the web novel circle, Tycoon Youyue! The identity of Lady Zhao might be a plus point for others, but for a male chauvinist like him, it was a minus. He wanted a girl that he could win over in various areas \u2013 not someone like Zhao Youyue who could crush him in all areas.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me Queen!\u201d was an exceptionally good book that became extremely popular recently. Its author was \u201cThe Knee Which Does Not Talk,\u201d who was called a God author, based on this single book, which also happened to be his only. The various paragraphs and chapters in the book kept readers glued for hours. Its contents made them laugh and cry many times over a single reading. Zhao Youyue had been recommended by another tycoon to read this book. As a result, she became addicted to it. First, she rewarded it with two Silver Sect Masters. Then, as the book was competing in the ranking board, Zhao Youyue gave out another 1,000,000 points to the novel and became the Golden Sect Master of the book.</p><br/><p>For an average reader, it was ridiculous to spend RMB 12,000 on a book. It was unimaginable. Well, poverty has restricted their imagination. To Tycoon Youyue, it was probably a regular joe\u2019s RMB 1,200? No, even lesser, maybe\u2026</p><br/><p>In conclusion, Xiao Yiren felt as if he had just won the grand prize in a lottery. Might Zhao Youyue notice his book, one day?</p><br/><p>Is he living in the world of his novel?</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cBot account\u201d () is an account for marketing purposes.</p></div>\n</div>"}

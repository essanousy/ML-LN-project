He felt like the emperor of all Douyu Streamers. The live streamers were all slaves to please him, and the audiences were merely his people.</p><br/><p>But what could he do? This female live streamer is also a tycoon. She was not lacking in money. He couldn\u2019t do a thing if she doesn\u2019t want to open her webcam.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it is said that be it within the literary industry or the live-stream industry, those who do not bow towards money are most annoying. No one would understand the desires and thoughts of such individuals!</p><br/><p>What Zhao Youyue really wanted was an existence of her own, she wanted acknowledgment. This was a place for Xiao Yu to enjoy herself showing off and making herself matter in this world. However, she rarely ever live-streamed as \u2018herself\u2019.</p><br/><p>She did not expect her calm, soothing style to draw in so many more viewers, compared to Xiao Yu\u2019s non-stop blabbering style.</p><br/><p>Now, the subscribers of her live broadcast room had almost reached 200,000!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Hao had a move in mind. He first gave this female live streamer a helicopter, and sent another popup, saying, \u201cDo you think I was just kidding with my 10 helicopters gift? Obviously not! I\u2019ve given you one as proof. Hurry open your webcam; there\u2019s 9 more!\u201d</p><br/><p>This one helicopter by Zhao Hao had increased the popularity of this live broadcast room even more. Many commenters came to grab the treasure box that would appear after each helicopter is given. But after they entered the room, they felt reluctant to leave, because they heard a very melodious violin sound\u2026</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue asked the commenters within the room to suggest some songs, some of them quoted some pop music, such as songs by Joker Xue[1].</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt that it was such a waste that there were no Jay Chous[2] in this world. She loved his songs the most, especially the ones that incorporated classical, Chinese orchestra.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had come well-prepared. She started to play the tune on her violin.</p><br/><p>To most people, they would hardly feel anything from listening to hard, classical violin pieces. Instead, they preferred the melody of songs that they were familiar with, as long as they are played fluently.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s skill with the violin was not just fluent, but it also had depth and emotion, although it could not be compared with \u2018Chu Luoxun\u201ds.</p><br/><p>When she plays as \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 she would utilize the maxed music talent stat to do many things. For instance, she would rearrange the music score of the iconic songs that existed in reality, or within her mind into full-on, proper violin melodies.</p><br/><p>This was not something that could be done by anyone. \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 is able to perfectly rearrange pop music into violin melodies, without anything being off. This is \u2018Chu Luoxun,\u2019 a girl blessed by the God of music.</p><br/><p>But of course, she was still mortal.</p><br/><p>There were also benefits for being mortal. Zhao Youyue could perfectly inherit everything from her.</p><br/><p>Previously, Zhao Youyue assumed that she might not be able to use the ability of the high energy level character cards. This was actually all based on her own assumptions.</p><br/><p>After all, she had not yet obtained such a character card. She seemed to be assuming things scientifically, forgetting that her very own \u2018Two Dimensional Gate\u2019 was a very unscientific existence.</p><br/><p>Therefore, not everything could be simply concluded, before she actually obtains a high energy level character card.</p><br/><p>There was also merits within her idea of \u2018being self-reliant\u2019 \u2013 \u2018not relying on the character cards.\u2019 Since she was able to master \u2018Xu Jing\u2019 and \u2018Yu Shengfan\u201ds abilities by her own efforts, this meant that she could apply science into analyzing the \u2018superpower\u2019 stuff. As long as the analysis is thorough, she might even be able to manifest those superpowers in reality.</p><br/><p>\u2018Two Dimensional Gate\u2019 is truly a fascinating existence. You will never know what surprises you can get, until you arrive at the location and survey the scenery there yourself!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue devotedly played \u201cAmbiguous Relationship\u201d by Joker Xue. It was quite a feat for anyone to play this song with the violin. After recognizing the familiar melody, many commenters sent popups praising her\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu is truly 666, she is so versatile, to be able to play the violin so well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Yu, this must be your own rearrangement, right? I\u2019m truly convinced. It\u2019s really nice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis must be a 10th-grade level violinist, right? By the way, is 10th grade the highest grade for violin? But then, even those full graded violinists can never play the violin this well. I truly worship Ah Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSurprise appearance of a violin expert on Douyu! How about a song by Hiroyuki Sawano next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Hiroyuki Sawano?\u201d Must be some kind of anime gibberish that only fat otakus will listen to! Hehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAny problem being a \u2018fat otaku\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue immediately accepted the excellent suggestion. She played the song \u201cMKaliez\u201d and \u201c\u201d [3] by Hiroyuki Sawano. She even managed to re-enact the Sawano-style pauses with her violin perfectly. The commenters who loved 2D stuff praised her, \u201cIt\u2019s too awesome! Too nice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, be it Zhao Youyue or the commenters, everyone had totally forgotten about \u2018Boss Hao\u2019 who had planned to establish his own existence by spamming helicopters. This situation left Zhao Hao very embarrassed.</p><br/><p>But after he descended into the world of this female live streamer\u2019s melody, that embarrassment was quickly lost. Instead, he continued spamming the helicopters, one after another. This was because he truly admired her talent, and he just happened to have no other place to spend his money.</p><br/><p>He decided to investigate the true identity of this female live streamer. He wanted to see who she actually was.</p><br/><p>When he noticed that she was yet not contracted, he felt even more helpless. Then he expressed his anger, \u201cIs Douyu blind? Why didn\u2019t they sign a contract with such a talented female live streamer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth is wrong with those Douyu officials? Why don\u2019t they sign a contract with such a female live streamer, one who totally has the potential to make herself famous throughout the whole of Douyu? Do they want to leave her to the other competitors?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao used the helicopters to release his dissatisfaction, while making Zhao Youyue\u2019s live broadcast room shot up the ranks!</p><br/><p>Many audiences treated her as a talent-type live streamer. They did not know that she was even more incredible when it comes to playing games\u2026</p><br/><p>Ye Hai, whose pen name was \u2018Leaves Fallen on the Sea,\u2019 heaved a sigh of relief. This female live streamer\u2019s previous live broadcasts were only cosplaying Yu Shengfan. She was in her normal condition today. Previously, he thought that he had gone completely crazy, thinking that Yu Shengfan had traveled into reality!</p><br/><p>He continued spamming a few helicopters within the live broadcast room in order to suppress his surprise. Since he was now a Platinum writer, he had grown rather wealthy! He had the capital to get addicted to female live streamers\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1.Joker Xue Joker Xue, formerly known as Jacky Xue, is a Chinese singer, comedian, record producer, actor, and television host.</p><br/><p>2.Jay Chou Jay Chou is a famous Taiwanese musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, film producer, actor, and director.</p><br/><p>3.\u201dMKaliez\u201d and \u201c\u201d\u201dMKaliez\u201d is the IN(interlude) of a Japanese anime called \u201cAldnoah Zero\u201d, where as \u201c\u201d is the IN of another anime called \u201cGuilty Crown\u201d.

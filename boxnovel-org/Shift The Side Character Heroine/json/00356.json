On the contrary, her existence was healing and therapeutic. She became an iconic character, not because she was remembered through death, but because of her talent in creating works, and her ability to eat books like it was food\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could not help but add something to Wen Qingyu. This new setting was so that whenever she eats a book, she would be able to remember it completely. This was equivalent to the ability to read books and never forget them. If she had such an ability in the real world, it would be great.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue had nothing to do, she could just casually eat some books; then she would probably be able to get a nickname like \u201cwalking library.\u201d</p><br/><p>All things having been accounted for, Zhao Youyue went on to think about how she could get closer to Lin Shiya, or master \u201cYa Jing.\u201d Even if Lin Shiya was not Ya Jing, she had to be closely related to the person in question. Otherwise, why would such a talented writer willingly ghostwrite in her name?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was confident in \u201cWen Qingyu,\u201d because the character had been created by Ya Jing\u2019s creative talent. The novel of \u201cBakuman\u201d was of fairly high quality. The content was historically accurate to the literary world of today. It was capable of getting the readers highly interested. Moreover, its \u201cPOV writing style\u201d would leave readers wondering who would end up as the best in the literary world.</p><br/><p>Such novels produced outstanding depictions of the characters that clans would start forming under various banners once again. Each character would gain strong followings. What Zhao Youyue wanted to do was to make the character that she controlled gain the most supporters, and in extension to that, the most popularity.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue finished reading the introduction of \u201cBakuman,\u201d which only consisted of roughly tens of thousands of words, she went on to search for Ya Jing\u2019s other works on the internet.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, on the Qidian novel website, there were electronic versions of Ya Jing\u2019s novel.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the subscription count of her electronic versions was rather high. All of them had a medal on them, which meant that they all had at least 3,000 subscribers.</p><br/><p>For printed books like these which were rather old-fashioned to have such a subscription count meant that people approved of it. If not for that, how could its subscription count be so high when the Qidian novel website was clearly a platform catered towards web novel readers?</p><br/><p>It was a pity that electronic versions of printed books like these would usually only appear on the Qidian novel website after the books are completed, and after the heat of their sales have died down. Readers familiar with the Qidian novel website would all know that such books had little power in the ranking boards. The harsh truth was that many web novel readers enjoyed the thrill of chasing after new chapters.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue decided to add Ya Jing\u2019s novels to her library, both of which were about 200,000 words long. A novel of this length would probably take up to one day of reading, at most.</p><br/><p>However, she was a little tired today. She had a healthy lifestyle, and was used to sleeping early and getting up early. Thus, she fell asleep at around 11 o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>This, in fact, was all thanks to the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate,\u201d because she always looked forward to entering it to enjoy the otherworldly sights.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wanjun, of course, did not go to sleep so early on that day. After all, she was a university student. In this era, where would you find university students with proper circadian rhythms?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not forget that it was during the holidays. Of course, she had to stay up late. She still had to catch up on some dramas.</p><br/><p>Even so, she did not stay up too late. After all, she was prepared to take good care of her cute sister Youyue for the next few days. She would definitely not feel at ease if Zhao Youyue was left in Zhao Hao\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao would sometimes go overboard when having fun. He was like a bear cub. Moreover, Zhao Hao\u2019s friends were not exactly good influence. That \u201cNation\u2019s Husband\u201d Ding Yuncong was already considered a spotless white horse. After all, he was a public figure, widely known for his approachable, easy-going personality. He was like an untouchable, rich second generation.</p><br/><p>Although many believed that Ding Yuncong\u2019s best achievement throughout his entire life was that he had successfully reincarnated into a good family, he was actually rather successful in his career. His live stream platform even had an e-Sports team, and they were quite a hit.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao\u2019s had already sold off his e-Sports team, because he soon found that his favorite thing was not e-Sports, but spending lots of money on online games. He devoted more of his energy to his basketball team and car racing team. He felt that they were way more interesting, compared to e-Sports\u2026</p><br/><p>Furthermore, after he found out that his very own sister Youyue was Ah Yu, he had been able to mock Ding Yuncong unscrupulously. The professional players you have in your professional gaming team were no match to my sister at all! What\u2019s the point of playing professionally? Pack your bags and go home!</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong could not even refute, because Zhao Youyue was indeed a pub stomper in LoL. Some nosy people have even edited and compiled the highlights of her playing against major professional players in ranked games. She had killed almost every professional player out there. If it was just one or two professional players that have been suppressed by her, it could be considered a fluke on her part. However, the key factor was that it was not just one or two of them\u2026</p><br/><p>There were also some superstitious fans of the professional players who thought that Ah Yu was only good at ranked games. If she were to actually play professionally, her various shortcomings would undoubtedly be exposed.</p><br/><p>However, no one questioned or doubted Ah Yu\u2019s talents, especially after her true identity was revealed. Many fans felt that it was a pity that Ah Yu did not go ahead and play professionally. However, her response left her fans speechless \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>If there was a Lin Feng in this world, as long as he sends her an invitation, she would certainly play professionally.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao decided that he would bring Zhao Youyue to visit his car racing team this time, as it so happened that his team had an upcoming race around the corner. Although races on their level were not as interesting as the Shanghai f1 racing competition which was to be held in April, it was of some standard. Spectating a race in person was definitely a lot more exciting, compared to watching it through a screen!</p><br/><p>If Zhao Hao\u2019s driving skills were actually decent, he might have gone ahead and sat behind a wheel.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao was aware that the so-called underground racing, or death racing, which was held on the mountains, provided the real form of excitement. It was awash with stunts similar to those in mangas, but it was way too dangerous, one mistake and it would be a deadly car crash\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day, Zhao Youyue got up very early. Zhang Wanjun was still asleep. She did not wake her up. Instead, after brushing up, she decided to read both of Ya Jing\u2019s books quietly. She felt that it was best if she interacted with Ya Jing as a loyal reader; it was the safest option. As a loyal reader, she had to make sure that she knew the books well.</p><br/><p>Ya Jing\u2019s creative talent had never been overstated. Her first piece of work, entitled \u201cThe Way of University,\u201d was beautifully written. Zhao Youyue could not help but think of another piece of work written by Jiang Nan called \u201cLife as a Juvenile.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a refreshing university campus story. The language used was simple and concise. The author wrote the whole book as if it was a trivial matter, something not even worth mentioning. However, each small detail shone subtle hints on philosophical arguments, and contained phrases worthy of becoming notable quotations\u2026</p><br/><p>No wonder Ya Jing was a genius writer\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

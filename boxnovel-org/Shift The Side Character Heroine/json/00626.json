It was the product of Alchemy. One\u2019s attributes would increase upon ingestion. However, not anyone could just down it. Alchemical ingredients were highly toxic to regular humans.</p><br/><p>Olivia was not actually interested in things like using foreign materials to increase her attributes. After all, this was a game, and she was a hacker.</p><br/><p>However, these \u2018Witcher Quests\u2019 provided extra rewards, so why pass up on this?</p><br/><p>Olivia did not act rashly. In reality, Olivia had an abnormal amount of experience in fighting monsters and creatures, as she possessed all the abilities of \u2018Jane Doe Su.\u2019 She could rely on her dodging abilities to make herself invincible to monsters. That is right, that was her unrivaled tumbling!</p><br/><p>Tumbling might end up being highly useful in this Source World. Perhaps all gaming worlds used it as a staple mechanic?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the self-proclaimed professional witcher, Geralt, had applied the Necrophage oil on himself. Then, he made a casting gesture with his hands. It turns out that he had cast a \u2018Quen Sign\u2019 [1] on himself!</p><br/><p>This was the first time Olivia had ever seen a witcher in battle. He was cool! As expected, this was an action hero!</p><br/><p>There was a golden layer of halo around Geralt\u2019s head right after casting the \u2018Quen Sign.\u2019 He appeared to be in an invincible state. In reality, the \u2018Quen Sign\u2019 was a protective shield that could absorb all incoming damage from monsters. Unless the enemy\u2019s attacks shatter the shield, nothing could hurt Geralt at all.</p><br/><p>Geralt has always appeared brave and courageous in front of females. It was no wonder that he enamored many beautiful girls. For example, Yennefer [2] from Vengerberg [3] was his soulmate, and was always ready to be the mother of his child.</p><br/><p>Geralt, who thought himself well-prepared, rushed forth!</p><br/><p>Then the foglers appeared!</p><br/><p>Olivia had been mentally prepared to face the battle. However, the \u2018foglers\u2019 who were Necrophages [4] were extremely ugly, which slightly threw her off.</p><br/><p>Foglers were shorter than humans. Their bodies were slightly hunched, and their arms ended in long, pointed fingers. In fact, from their huge feet and claws alone, you would know that its attacking power was not to be underestimated. They did not seem to have any skin \u2013 their blood vessels were even visible and exposed. Most horrendously, their brains jiggled about as they moved. They had glowing blue eyes that emitted an ominous glint, exposed sharp teeth that were interlocked, and two huge and sharp ears\u2026</p><br/><p>Even though Olivia had seen many monsters and demons in the literary world of the \u201cTales of Wuxia 3\u201d, these western monsters were far uglier. Furthermore, the realism levels of the literary world could not even be compared to Source World\u2019s.</p><br/><p>As confident as Olivia was when it came to holding her own in combat, the sight of these nightmarish images still left her knees feeling weak. It would be wise to cast a magic shield on herself first. In fact, the witchers\u2019 signs were actually simplified forms of conventional magic. In other words, her magic shield would be something like a completed, upgraded version of the \u2018Quen Sign.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since Geralt was acting as the main tank, Olivia felt relatively safe. However, she would soon realize that she had overestimated Geralt, who she had thought to be the ideal action hero. She did not expect that Geralt, who had rushed towards the foglers in elaborate fashion, could not finish the foglers off. This was because the foglers would always use their signature skills at the most crucial moment. It was similar to the Shadow Clone Technique from the Naruto Anime\u2026</p><br/><p>Therefore, Geralt, in spite of his magnificient and excellent swordsmanship, could not hit the foglers at all. After all, this was the real world, and not a game. Geralt was a human being and not some player-controlled character. Levels did not differentiate monsters in the real world.</p><br/><p>Witchers might even fall before seemingly easy enemies like Necrophages. That was why they had to make sufficient preparations before every battle. For example, applying the correct Necrophage oil on his blade, casting the \u2018Quen Sign,\u2019 and drink some potions, etc.</p><br/><p>The foglers in the game were creatures that might be one or two levels above regular Necrophages. A player-controlled witcher would make short work of them. However, a real-life Geralt would face some trouble.</p><br/><p>Geralt was starting to regret this. He had not prepared a \u2018Moon Dust\u2019 [5] bomb. This bomb contained Quicksilver solution [6] which could cause their illusory ability to lose its effectiveness. At least, he would not be hitting thin air.</p><br/><p>This was by no means Geralt\u2019s fault. After all, Alchemy bombs were not cheap. Geralt was not one for meticulous planning, thus he would always be short of money. Was it because he was too addicted to the Gwent [7] card game that frequently left his pockets empty?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he had not been prepared for this battle. Most importantly, Olivia, the \u2018step-child\u2019 was there. He had to keep an eye out for her.</p><br/><p>Just as he started cursing his fate, the \u2018step-child\u2019 Olivia finally got to her feet!</p><br/><p>After observing the battle for a few minutes, Olivia had consulted her various in-game indexes and cards, and figured the foglers out, down to their weaknesses!</p><br/><p>Olivia, a trained mage, had a solid foundation of magic from her talented teacher \u2018Vilgefortz.\u2019 The rest of it was her doing. Mages\u2019 would usually use their \u2018wind blades\u2019 for long-range attacks, but she held her \u2018wind blade\u2019 in her hands!</p><br/><p>This magical sword was made up of solid wind and was almost invisible. It was just like the Excalibur wielded by Altria [8] in the Anime \u2018Fate/stay night\u2019. The questionability of its power aside, it definitely looked cool. It was even cooler than Geralt\u2019s silver blade!</p><br/><p>Olivia then transformed into the best swordsman in the Wuxia world \u2013 Jane Doe Su. She cast a magic shield, and while holding up her wind blade, rushed forward!</p><br/><p>The foglers were at their weakest right after their illusions are struck. During that short period, their physical bodies would be revealed, and they would be less than mobile.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Geralt would have eventually won. After all, these foglers were small-fry. However, Olivia did not want to pass up on this quest: \u2018Assist the witcher against the foglers.\u2019</p><br/><p>Therefore, Lady Olivia Zhao charged into fray. She seemed to have forgotten that she was a mage\u2026</p><br/><p>The foglers who just had their illusions smashed apart by Geralt had distanced themselves from Geralt. They were waiting for Geralt to rush towards them. Who knows, they might be able to evade his attacks by then. Little did they expect the little girl \u2013 their food, to rush towards them!</p><br/><p>They thoroughly underestimated the little girl. On top of that, they could not see the invisible \u2018wind blade\u2019 in her hands. Almost leisurely, they swung their claws at the girl\u2026</p><br/><p>The foglers were relieved. The witcher had held them against the ropes. Finally, a weakling for them to kill!</p><br/><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Geralt screamed!</p><br/><p>Of course, he quickly fell silent\u2026 The air had became eeriely still, while the atmosphere became very awkward.</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cQuen Sign\u201d () is a simple magical symbol used by witchers.

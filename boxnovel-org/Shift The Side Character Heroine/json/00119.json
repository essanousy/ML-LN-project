Her eyes shot open in astonishment. This was because Rosemary had been delaying the chapters lately, and even earned the nickname \u201cDelayed Rose.\u201d Well, this \u201cDelayed Rose\u201d had updated 20 chapters in one shot!</p><br/><p>If not for the reminder that Han Leng had given her, she would not have been able to hold back and tip Rosemary a Sect Master again!</p><br/><p>After all, 1,000 RMB was really nothing for her. Moreover, we must not forget that she had just taken a red packet worth around 100,000 RMB from her super, God of Tycoons cousin, Zhao Hao and her talented elite scholar cousin, Zhang Wanjun who earns money by making her own short videos.</p><br/><p>That was also why she had forgotten to stream any of her gameplays live to earn money. Actually, it was something she had considered after getting the character card of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d. She felt that it would be very cool if she could use her own abilities to pay for her own living expenses, like her cousin Zhang Wanjun. Not only would she impress her parents, she would also boost her own raison d\u2019etre.</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t have to necessarily show your face when you are playing a live stream game. As long as you play well, possess the knack for golden commentaries, play a few golden or platinum rounds; you would definitely be famous. Of course, she could pull off a stunt before becoming popular. For example, she could score the highest points in a live single player game or become a national champion. How was it possible for her not to become the national champion with the gaming talents of Yu Shengfan?</p><br/><p>As for a professional career, she had never taken it into consideration. After all, there were no Lin Feng in this world. When she uses the \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d character card, only a Lin Feng would gain her notice. The rest of the players were nothing but rookies to her. After being cursed and insulted by her nonchalantly, how would there be teamwork between them?</p><br/><p>Also, professional gamers did not earn any more money than a streamer would. Speaking of which, her uncle Zhao Jiaren was a board member of Douyu, it should be quite easy for him to get her a relatively loose contract</p><br/><p>Although she had great plans, when she realized that she was no longer short of cash, her plans of becoming a female streamer to earn money was temporarily put on hold. Actually, instead of becoming a female streamer, she was more well-suited as a God of Tycoons who could throw money on the heads of streamers.</p><br/><p>It was just like her throwing money in for the books she loved, in order to help them reach the top charts.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s other account, \u201cImYouyueHerBrother\u201d still had around eight million Qidian coins. Previously, Zhao Hao had topped up twenty million Qidian coins (200,000 RMB). He had spent ten million Qidian coins (100,000 RMB) for a Golden Sect Master, one million Qidian coins (10,000 RMB) for a Silver Sect Master, and there was not any extra expense besides the full subscription of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d which was around a few thousands Qidian coins. Even though Zhao Hao created a God of Tycoons account, but in reality, he did not read a lot of webnovels. If it was not because he loved games so much, he would not even read \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d by Rosemary.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao was a hardcore reader who loved pirated novels. He even signed up a Qidian account that he had never bothered to use and asked Zhao Youyue to open up the auto-subscription function. Whether to tip the book or not, he simply left that decision in her hands. If there is no more money in the account, just inform him, and he would top up 50,000 RMB every time, which was equivalent to five million Qidian coins, or five Silver Sect Masters.</p><br/><p>The game \u201cEternal war\u201d in the book \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was a combination of traditional RPG games and competitive MOBA games such as \u201cLeague of legends\u201d. Zhao Hao was interested, because he loved to play both types of games.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, the authority of Zhao Hao\u2019s Qidian account had fallen into Zhao Youyue\u2019s hands. As the fair, rich and beautiful reader \u201cYouyue\u201d, she had a distinct reputation in the circle of authors and readers. She even built her own book list which contained all the books she loved or had been given a tip of Sect Master. It was coined as the \u201cMoon\u2019s gentleness\u201d. Moreover, she also wrote book reviews for all the books on the list. Although the reviews were not always positive, they were filled with sincerity.</p><br/><p>Due to the fact she is a famous God of Tycoons reader, and the list did not have the function that enabled one to recommend it to friends, she had written all the reviews by herself after she was finished reading the books and mangas. Therefore, the earnest, heartfelt list often left people fulfilled and content. There was also the fact that she would always tip at least one Sect Master for her favorite books, which made her list even more convincing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s taste in books was rather unconventional, especially since she was a female reader. She had no interest in those books written by the popular High Gods and she would love to stay as far as possible from books centered around harems or multiple love interests. On the other hand, books with only one female character or books that emphasized on leveling up, totally strikes her sweet spot. For instance, books by the Supreme God \u201cI eat tomatoes\u201d, or books without a main female character or couples, just like Rosemary\u2019s \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue also read chick lit books. However, she did not favor stories where the main female protagonist gets f*cked from the very start. For her, a tormented love story was the worst. She also hoped that emotional and sentimental storylines would be lessened. The best case would be for a story to be sweet and smooth-sailing throughout the entire plot. There should not be any unexpected surprises or a mundane plotline, just like the novel \u201cLOVE O2O\u201d.</p><br/><p>The truth was, even though Zhao Youyue\u2019s taste in books was unique, there was still quite a number of readers who had similar tastes. In just a very short amount of time, her book list had more than 100,000 followers and soon became one of the top trending book lists in the whole Qidian site! Zhao Youyue had also transformed from a God of Tycoons reader to a trending book list owner. If any book makes it to the cover page for her list, at least 500 to 600 favorites would follow soon after, and the title would be added the collection of various readers, even if it doesn\u2019t turn up in a recommended list. This would be the might and power of a trending book list!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue originally wanted to become an editor in the future, so that she would have direct access to the authors. However, she realized that she no longer had to become an editor any longer. That was because there were many low and Middle God writers approaching and recommending their books to her. Some were even shameless enough to ask if she could add their books to her trending book list</p><br/><p>Even some of the High God writers were rather kind and polite towards her. Moreover, she even had the ways of contacting them. In the world of web novels and manga, she was now doing great as a reader, even though she had never written a book or drew a manga of her own</p><br/><p>Those authors were clearly clueless that Zhao Youyue was befriending them for her own convenience. She could ask for a female cameo, and after that, it would be her show time.</p><br/><p>In her most recent trending book list, the top book was, of course, Rosemary\u2019s \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d. A lot of readers were complimenting this book that she had recommended and had been giving her flowers. This was also a way of earning Qidian coins. Even though it was an insignificant amount to her, it was a token of appreciation from the normal readers</p><br/><p>Her review on \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was that it was a shonen, soul-burning kind of Esports novel. The unique part was that the story had distinctively different characters, and there were no villains, but enemies in the whole novel. Gaming was just gaming, as there were no messy, real-life plots. In any case, the new High God Rosemary would not everyone down. He would not write a depressing story development, and everyone was guaranteed to have a happy ending! She really trusted Rosemary, and had even leaked certain information regarding the ending in her book review. It would end up as a warm \u201cDaddy battle\u201d between Lin Feng and Yu Shengfan. It was one of the original endings that Rosemary had in mind, and many readers felt that it was interesting and filled with warmth</p><br/><p>However, when she finished reading the 20 chapters updated by Rosemary, she found herself almost out of breath and felt like crushing her phone!</p><br/><p>If she had not prepared herself mentally, she would have smacked her phone into the ground!</p><br/><p>This pit hole Rosemary, he really had the heart to do it!</p><br/><p>Most importantly, he even described the death of \u201cLittle Fish\u201d so tragically! As the person who used to be \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, she also wanted to cry for her own passing</p>\n</div>"}

Or it was just a flag [1]?</p><br/><p>Now, Chu Luoxun and Lin Meiyue, the two female characters, have caused much dispute among the mainstream readers. Concerning the interaction between the male protagonist and the Goddess Chu in music, or him getting closer to Lin Meiyue romantically, neither side could ever come to an agreement.</p><br/><p>According to the fan club of Lin Meiyue, Leng Zi has already guaranteed a perfect love between Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue. Chu Luoxun did not even intend to compete with Lin Meiyue; she had even assisted them</p><br/><p>Now, they had time to date every day. Lin Meiyue was jealous, even \u2013 not because of Goddess Chu but Wang Yan, her bestie. She was always around Gu Yuan, using music discussion as her reason.</p><br/><p>Of course, Wang Yan would be rejected. With her musical standard that was incomparable to Lin Yuemei, did she even qualify to discuss music with Gu Yuan?</p><br/><p>However, Lin Yuemei was unhappy since she had once accidentally discovered Gu Yuan and Wang Yan alone together. Gu Yuan was misunderstood at that time, as it was a coincidence. He and Lin Meiyue had agreed to meet at the library, but awkwardly, Wang Yan came before she did.</p><br/><p>At a crucial time such as this, Goddess Chu, the queen of assists had to come into play. She treated Lin Meiyue as her own sister, not only guiding her in music but had also encouraged her to be more proactive, and to be firm in her relationship, not allowing the tides to take her.</p><br/><p>As for a treacherous person like Wang Yan, Goddes Chu gave her a lesson by using music, telling her that she was not qualified to discuss music with the male protagonist.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun had even created an opportunity for the male protagonist and the heroine to be together alone, at a French-style cake shop, owned by her family. And thus, her family background was finally uncovered. She was not just a missy, her family\u2019s financial situation was rather lavish too. Her parents\u2019 cake shop had its own franchise and was a well-known brand.</p><br/><p>This cake shop was where she could often be found, and what she did there depended on her mood. The shop was full of harmony and art. There was a variety of musical instruments as well, all of which she knew how to play.</p><br/><p>It was a double-story shop. Chu Luoxun stayed upstairs alone while leaving Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue by their lonesome two. She even prepared the cakes and the milk tea for them; all of which were free of charge.</p><br/><p>With the assistance of Chu Luoxun, they had managed to hold each other hands and confirmed their relationship as a couple. However, they did not want to reveal it in school, due to their shyness.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue were naturally intrigued by the unconditional assistance of Chu Luoxun.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun had simply said that she could gain many forms of musical inspirations from their beautiful relationship.</p><br/><p>Even so, they were still not convinced. Without talking nonsense, Chu Luoxun sat in front of the piano in the cake shop, and played and sang the song, \u201cSweet\u201d\u2014</p><br/><p>I gently tasted the love you said which was for me</p><br/><p>And felt the aftertaste of your tenderness</p><br/><p>I gently tasted the sweetly scented temptation</p><br/><p>I gently tasted the love you said which was for me</p><br/><p>I reluctantly ate the smiling candy</p><br/><p>I gently tasted it, even though there\u2019s only a little left</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll eat all of your love</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, this \u201cSweet\u201d was quite similar to \u201cSouth Mountain,\u201d which was written by the creator in his \u201cintoxicated state.\u201d They had thought that the lyrics were all their original creation</p><br/><p>When Han Leng reread the lyrics himself, his ears could hear the melody!</p><br/><p>Even Chu Luoxun\u2019s pleasant voice could be heard. After all, she was a talented musical all-rounder, good singing was a must!</p><br/><p>Han Leng was most pleased with the lyrics he wrote under the exploding tirade of his inspirations, even being too confident in himself, thinking that \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be mind-blowing if he can get a talented composer to turn it into a thing?</p><br/><p>Han Leng thought of Zhao Youyue, but he quickly shook his head. It was impossible for her to be able to compose a song. She was not the Goddess Chu that he created!</p><br/><p>If Zhao Youyue could do so, he will dress as a woman!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. He had set this song as a spontaneous improvisation of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 to elaborate on her musical talent. He then rendered the song in words of how sweet and how mellifluous it was, representing the love of Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue.</p><br/><p>Under the influence of the superb writing style and the sweet lyrics to seal the deal, the readers would smell the freshness too!</p><br/><p>Honestly, the first love of Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue was indeed sweet and very stable, as they moved forward steadily. However, some readers thought that Chu Luoxun should be the one for Gu Yuan, as Lin Meiyue was too mediocre and temperamental.</p><br/><p>Although this portrayed the cuteness of the character, the bighearted Chu Luoxun was far more preferable by their standards. How could Lin Meiyue be compared to her warmth which was like a sunshine?</p><br/><p>Some of the readers had pointed out that if Lin Meiyue is like a neighborhood girl that one could find everywhere, then the existence of Chu Luoxun would be the epitome of many men\u2019s dream girls. Would such a girl exist in reality?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t the purpose of the novel to turn fantasy into reality?</p><br/><p>Therefore, people hoped that Leng Zi would think thoroughly on finalizing the choice of the heroine. Although the relationship of Gu Yuan and LinMeiyue had been confirmed, they were not yet married, right? So, was this room for Gu Yuan to change his mind?</p><br/><p>The suggestion was rejected. Gu Yuan was not a playboy in \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d He was so innocent that he needed a truckload of assists to eventually confirm his relationship with Lin Meiyue.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he was sure that he only liked Lin Meiyue. He was not as obtuse as the other male protagonists and did not even hesitate when confessed to by other girls. For instance, he had outrightly rejected Wang Yan who had done everything she could to win his heart.</p><br/><p>Also, his ability to reproduce music precisely down to the final note had been recognized by many readers. Otherwise, no readers would think that he was well-matched with the Goddess Chu.</p><br/><p>It would certainly ruin his image if Gu Yuan becomes unfaithful</p><br/><p>Han Leng was definitely not going to do so, although he himself had become unfaithful, in reality. He would only express his love for Chu Luoxun through describing her music, and her pure love for music.</p><br/><p>He was so cunning, that the readers have gone by themselves and made up a love triangle, even thought he had not written so. Some even firmly believed that the \u201cSweet\u201d was written by Chu Luoxun, for Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>This song fooled Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue into completely believing in Chu Luoxun\u2019s beautiful lies.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue happily recorded this song. She and Gu Yuan would listen to it whenever they were alone by using earphones, sitting close to each other and holding hands. Their souls got closer because of it</p><br/><p>This was the sweetness of first love!</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun was alone whenever they were together, indulging herself in music under the beautiful moonlight.</p><br/><p>The moonlight was beautiful as usual.</p><br/><p>Just that, with some loneliness.</p><br/><p>This scene of loneliness had appeared in Han Leng\u2019s mind before he took the initiative to contact Zhao Youyue, and his heart seemed to calm down.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun definitely did not belong to the male protagonist but him, the creator!</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see, Lady Zhao.\u201d Han Leng sent his message.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] A flag is an internet slang that means a person\u2019s conduct is different from what he has promised.</p>\n</div>"}

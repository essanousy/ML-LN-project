He was always looking ahead. Even if there was no one in sight, he would never regret taking his solitary journey.</p><br/><p>The world would never run out of things to be regretful over. There was also a pesky saying that would somehow make itself relevant to everything \u2013 the past cannot be repeated. It was clear that until yesterday, they were still talking normally. However, all of a sudden, a void grew between them, and they never spoke to each other again. Well, things could be worse. At least they were still forcing smiles at each other. The smiles seemed to say, \u201cdon\u2019t take it to heart, we\u2019re still going to act like we\u2019re good friends.\u201d Even so, somewhere in the corner of their minds, both parties would be implicitly aware \u2013 that things were not the same anymore. When did this even happen? Why did we even drift apart? How could I not have seen any of it before it was too late?</p><br/><p>My old deskmate?</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t all of you just the same? What was the difference? Everyone is passing the world by, and the world has none the less to care about. Now, these classmates were drowning in their emotions. Two days later, they would realize that those emotions were all but false, and they would move one, tossing them aside.</p><br/><p>Admittedly, Du Hang was objectively blown away by Zhao Youyue\u2019s talent in music, but he still could not see the point in being so talented.</p><br/><p>It seemed to have meant a lot to her. He basically saw her glowing in power as she gained momentum and took the crowd in her hands. She did not glare like the sun, she glimmered like the stars.</p><br/><p>Even the suspected Asperger Du Hang was moved, if only slightly. He took his mobile phone out and tapped away \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the stars we see are no longer shining. The light that they once emitted would have to pass a myriad of dimensions before finally reaching our retinas. Everyone is imprisoned in the past. No matter how you plan to move forward, whenever you look up inadvertently, the actions of your past would always come down in torrents, just like the light from stars. They can neither be erased nor be brushed aside with laughter. They could only nag at you from the silent corner of your heart, only to be awakened in a moment of inadvertence.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Du Hang\u2019s mouth lifted slightly. Perhaps, if he re-read this, many years in the far future, he would think of the starlight that she was emitting at this very moment.</p><br/><p>Du Hang was unlike many other students. He was not like those gullible rats who took rumors at face value. In his heart, he had firmly deduced that Zhao Youyue was 100% innocent.</p><br/><p>As a creator with a terrifyingly high IQ score, he saw through the world like it was made of glass. That was precisely why he was lonely. He made no attempt to don a mask on his face. He had no need to build relationships and please anyone.</p><br/><p>This was different compared to Bai Yunshan\u2019s \u201cignorance towards the feelings of others.\u201d He knew all too well how others felt, and that was why he chose to remain by his lonely old self. He was his best companion.</p><br/><p>Du Hang\u2019s roommates had previously gossiped about Zhao Youyue\u2019s rumors. One of them could not help but say that they pitied Master Han \u2013 she somehow had him on a leash.</p><br/><p>He also consulted Du Hang about this matter. Du Hang only shoved a quote at his direction, in place of a proper reply \u2014- \u2014- In late Autumn, what exactly is everyone in the world doing?[1]</p><br/><p>The other three boys were speechless. What was that even supposed to mean? Talk normal, damnit! Was this why they called him Big Teacher Du? Were they currently in a philosophy class?</p><br/><p>Du Hang did not say anything more. He was not bothered to teach those who did not understand him. Of course, he might have gone into detail, had he been speaking to Zhao Youyue. Despite how he embraced his solitude, he had not yet exempted himself from having more interactions with pretty girls.</p><br/><p>In late Autumn, what exactly is everyone in the world doing? This was a famous quote.</p><br/><p>In this season, those who cared about what others in the world were doing, were those who were drowning in sadness and loneliness. Even if it was not those exact emotions, it was probably one produced when surrounded by loneliness.</p><br/><p>Loneliness, in its contrast, drew out the presence of others.</p><br/><p>To distract them from their loneliness, they would take more notice of others, trying to forget that they were individuals of their own.</p><br/><p>Conversely, this might be the representation of their desire for others to take notice of them.</p><br/><p>Others were mirrors that reflected light upon them.</p><br/><p>Essentially, others were nothing more than virtual images seen through their own filters, so there was only one existence \u2013 themselves.</p><br/><p>In the end, people only thought about themselves.</p><br/><p>Asking others in the world what they were doing was nothing more than an act to compare themselves to others, and learn of where they stood in the grand scale of the world. These people were merely reflecting on the actions carried throughout their meager existences.</p><br/><p>Stepping on others to prove oneself. It lacked sincerity. If it lacked sincerity, it was a wrong method.</p><br/><p>Therefore, only loneliness was justice. Loneliness was the correct solution.</p><br/><p>In Du Hang\u2019s opinion, Zhao Youyue was the correct solution. She fell victim to baseless rumors because she suddenly shot up into recognition, against her own will. Others who could not share her fame had to somehow pull her down to remain relevant.</p><br/><p>This was sad, but this was just how the world worked. He knew that he could not change the world. He could only share his justice with his readers.</p><br/><p>Du Hang had instantly seen through the truth behind the rumors, but he was too lazy to stand up and do something for Zhao Youyue. Moreover, he would definitely not go up to Zhao Youyue and tell her that he believed in her and such, even if he knew that this might gain her favor.</p><br/><p>What was the point? If he were to deal with the rumors, he would only stand in the line of unnecessary fire \u2014- \u2014- He could divert their attention by doing something even more outrageous than what those rumors purported. In the end, he would be the only one getting hurt.</p><br/><p>Du Hang had already attempted this, many times over during high school. He soon learned that it was not the solution \u2013 it only delayed the inevitable.</p><br/><p>In the process, he had learned much of the world and much about himself. It was better to lean back and wait for the world to change \u2013 if it could. If the situation spins wildly out of control that even the enigmatic Zhao Youyue starts to break down, his help might just become necessary. Consider him returning the goodwill given to him on the other day. She may have faked it, but he did not have to return it in kind. He would be sincere.</p><br/><p>Most gratifyingly, he had found the truth of the universe. Zhao Youyue was the correct solution to every problem. All by herself, she had torn through all her obstacles with sheer, brute sincerity.</p><br/><p>Over the past few days, photos of Zhao Youyue in her military outfit quickly spread all over the internet. As a \u201cmilitary training goddess,\u201d she soared with popularity. Many netizens began to dig deeper into her identity. The truth shook them to the core!</p><br/><p>Was this not Miss Ah Yu? If it was not for her recent military training photos, her fans would have almost forgotten how Ah Yu looked like. She had not turned her camera on for such a long time. Moreover, photos of her on the internet were quite scarce, so much so that rumors were going around saying that Miss Ah Yu had been imprisoned her legendary family. Thus, she was no longer allowed to show her face\u2026</p><br/><p>Now that her pure, refreshing military training photos have finally made it on the internet, this has, of course, given Ah Yu\u2019s hardcore loyal fans a big, pleasant surprise. Some people mentioned that Ah Yu was currently embroiled in disparaging, slanderous rumors that went all around her university. Of course, in a short time, her fans quickly rose to defend their champion!</p><br/><p>Translation note :</p><br/><p>[1] This is a notable quote by Wataru Watari, in his light novel \u201cMy Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Zhao Youyue\u2019s facial expression as well as the aura she was emitting, was akin to none other than the Tri-no girl elite scholar herself!</p><br/><p>As a mangaka herself, Su Li always had the feeling that Xu Jing was actually someone with life and soul. But she ended up walking towards the ocean, drowning herself in the grand finale, and Su Li was responsible for this misery.</p><br/><p>Had Xu Jing broken the Fourth Wall and made her way into the real world, her \u201ccreator\u201d, Su Li would definitely be on pins and needles. Remember the power of this darkened elite scholar, she could really wreak havoc in reality. After drawing the finale, Su Li had a nightmare in which Xu Jing emerged from the ocean, with a cleaver on her hand, proceeding to stab Su Li. Whenever she thought of it, she always felt a chill down her spine.</p><br/><p>Of course this was Su Li\u2019s mere imagination. In the manga, Xu Jing had neither displayed any form of form of martial arts, nor wielded a cleaver. She only made everyone her pawns in accordance with her script. But beyond her expectation, Yang Xixi would rather choose her brother\u2019s head than herself.</p><br/><p>No. Did she really not expect that to happen?</p><br/><p>Perhaps she was just pretending to fall in love with Yang Xixi, her real motive was to take her revenge on society!</p><br/><p>She had a solid reason to do so. These guys and the creator outside the Fourth Wall had disrupted her, her studies and her time to be alone. So, she would revenge on them one after another, and finally the creator, Su Li herself!</p><br/><p>Su Li felt that this was the truth behind all of this, but she was afraid to tell everyone this frightening truth.</p><br/><p>Anyway, she was almost terrified by the fact that she could depict a character like Xu Jing. Su Li herself had no schemes nor the silent but terrifying power of Xu Jing, but miraculously, she was able to create this most iconic character in \u201cPure Romance\u201d. Looking back, she felt as if she was possessed by a ghost!</p><br/><p>Anyway, who would believe that the mangaka, Su Li herself was terrified of her own creation, \u201cXu Jing\u201d.</p><br/><p>After looking at the astonished Su Li, Zhao Youyue put her usual kind and gentle, yet elegant smile back on, \u201cThanks for your compliment. Indeed, I like the character of Xu Jing. No, I think I\u2019m deeply in love with her. Whenever I see Xu Jing studying quietly, it gave me a limitless motivation to focus on my own studies as well, not to mention that my results had improved greatly. I had actually tipped you this much because of this character.</p><br/><p>Su Li rubbed her eyes and looked at Zhao Youyue once more. She let out a sigh of relief. She felt uneasy after hearing her words, \u201cWell, I still have to thank you for the tips. I have a new project coming soon, and I will post it on Qidian manga website, I hope that you will have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I will definitely tip you a Silver Sect Master.\u201d She smiled as she took a sip of her coffee. She frowned a little, and refused to drink again. Lazy Zhao would rather waste that cup of coffee than spoil her taste buds.</p><br/><p>After hearing Zhao Youyue\u2019s words, she replied gratefully, \u201cWow, I must thank you for your generosity! So Youyue-chan, do you have any suggestions for my upcoming new project?\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, Zhao Youyue merely wanted to dissuade her from writing anymore Harem manga, as she might not read her mangas after tipping her a Silver Sect Master out of their friendship. Both the plots and character settings of her novel were boring, yet it became famous not because of Su Li at all. However, a brilliant idea suddenly flashed across her mind, she said, \u201cAre you interested to collaborate with others? You will be fully in charge of drawing though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li did not turn down Zhao Youyue\u2019s suggestion immediately. She did not bear the arrogance of some authors, nor did she became cocky after the godly success of \u201cPure Romance\u201d. She actually realized that her creativity ability had not developed much, instead, she had fully mastered the use of holy light[1] and was able to portray sex scenes without showing the nipples. The male readers could have a sustain erection upon reading them\u2026 she had successfully grabbed the male readers by their nuts.</p><br/><p>How Su Li wished she could hone her creative ability, as she wanted to draw some interesting and enticing plots, not to infer from those erotic kinds of stuff again to attract more attention.</p><br/><p>She honestly knew that she had space for improvement, \u201cI will gladly collaborate with others and become a painter. But, under two conditions. First, the original work of the author must be a good one that allows me to learn something in the progress. Second, it must have a constant income. Considering if there aren\u2019t 3,000 average subscriptions every month, it won\u2019t be qualified to be released as a book. So, it depends on the author and his work. I don\u2019t mind being a painter at all, it\u2019ll save me the burden of devising a new plot anyway, I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue perceived Su Li\u2019s sincerity on hearing those words, so she told her about the author Rosemary and his novel \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, even though now there were more male fans. This novel would certainly have more female fans after it got popular, if only Su Li could turn it into a manga.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not force Su Li to follow her suggestions, instead she recommended her to have a look at the novel first. It would be better if she liked it too. But if she had no interest in this particular novel, then she could just forget about it.</p><br/><p>Su Li tapped her chest and stated that she would definitely give it a shot, \u201cI saw Rosemary appearing in the same author\u2019s group in QQ. I got invited by the admin, \u2018Mr. Sea\u2019 into the group after my \u2018Pure Romance\u2019 got really famous. His connection with people is definitely wide, as he can chat with other famous Qidian authors too. As a newcomer, I didn\u2019t talk much with the others but I can tell that Rosemary is seriously a dedicated player, he often invites others to play games with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue heard the name \u201cRosemary\u201d, she twitched her mouth a little. Did he block all the other fan groups just so he had time to chat in this author\u2019s group?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t update his new chapters but he had time to play games?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue suddenly thought of a meme\u2014\u2014\u2014- a viral picture of a shiba inu sprawling on a sofa, along with the caption of \u201cI feel relaxed though I\u2019ve not written a single word\u201d.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Holy light () \u2013 a way of censorship in anime, which uses various shapes of light to cover inappropriate contents in the picture.</p>\n</div>"}

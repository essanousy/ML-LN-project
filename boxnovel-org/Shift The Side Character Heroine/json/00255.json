The proverb, music lingers in the air for three days after the performance ends, was never more apt. It was no exaggeration at all!</p><br/><p>This was Chu Luoxun\u2019s music which was blessed by the God of Music. Its effect was even more astonishing when manifested in reality!</p><br/><p>Even Zhao Youyue felt that she was moved such powerful music. However, what she had recalled during her performance were the three of her wives \u2014 Xu Jing, Yu Shengfan, and Chu Luoxun.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun was her favorite now, and she felt that her music had seduced her. This made her like the Goddess Chu even more!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue then came back to her seat. She put the violin back into the case after cleaning it.</p><br/><p>Then, she waited quietly for those who were there were enjoying the aftertaste of \u201cThe Song of Youth.\u201d She could see the expression on their faces constantly changing, as if they had encountered angels and demons in the musical world.</p><br/><p>After a while, those whose souls seemed to be out of their body and lost in the world built by Zhao Youyue\u2019 music and those who were still stared blankly woke up from their dreams</p><br/><p>A person started clapping for her, but it was certainly not Han Leng, as he was still lost in limbo. All the people there followed soon after. Their hearts cheered when as their speech had abandoned them!</p><br/><p>Although they did not express it verbally, their minds were racing \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThe violin\u2019s sound was amazing. I felt my soul being pulled in to a new world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was incredible! At first, I thought that I was not going to understand the meaning of this song, but, I managed to hear the meaning of youth from it. How does that even happen? Is this the charm of music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder she managed to win the Gold Prize of the Provincial Music Competition. With skills like that, she deserved it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I am intoxicated. I wish I could indulge in this type of music and never wake up from it\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis music is like music from the heavens. Would it be heard again?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the students that had been influenced by the music applauded sincerely. They did not need Han Leng to take the lead to applaud, just like what he had imagined before this.</p><br/><p>Han Leng awoke from his stupor. He noticed tears rolling down his cheeks, and he wiped his face. Then, he applauded vigorously as if to make up for the applause that had left him behind, while he was still lost in that musical state!</p><br/><p>He too, clapped for Zhao Youyue sincerely!</p><br/><p>It was truly amazing!</p><br/><p>His face blushed when he suddenly thought of the comment he had for Zhao Youyue. He was so ashamed of himself!</p><br/><p>Not only could her violin help her win the competition and gain recognition form the judges, it could turn around by 180 degrees and steal everyone\u2019s souls</p><br/><p>Wait a minute. Something is off.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this Chu Luoxun\u2019s music style?</p><br/><p>Han Leng realized it now. How did she know of Chu Luoxun\u2019s style?</p><br/><p>He looked at her in disbelief!</p><br/><p>The music was so nice to hear just now that he could not think much and was swept away by it. Now that he has escaped its clutches, he realized that he \u201cheard\u201d it before, during his \u201cintoxicated state\u201d!</p><br/><p>He was familiar with this music style. He admired the Goddess Chu because of this, and had taken her for his emotional anchor</p><br/><p>He always thought that this music style would only exist in his imagination, unless a Chu Luoxun existed in reality!</p><br/><p>But, that was impossible, right?</p><br/><p>It was impossible for a perfect Mary Sue like that Goddess to exist in reality, right?</p><br/><p>Even if the person does exist, why would it be her?</p><br/><p>This was inconceivable. He never expected that Zhao Youyue knew how to play the violin in Chu Luoxun\u2019s music style!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not deactivate the \u201cChu Luoxun Card\u201d immediately. She was addicted to it. It set her mind free and introduced her to a new level of euphoria. She felt that she was the most optimistic person in the world, and she could walk on clouds</p><br/><p>She would usually be cold-faced and stoic, but now she could not stop smiling, as she knew that her music had brought them happiness. Shouldn\u2019t she be happy about this?</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun always brought people great happiness, at the expense of leaving her lonesome to deal with all sorrow and loneliness.</p><br/><p>Then, Lao Qiu made an emotional speech, \u201cIt was regrettable that Zhao Youyue did not perform at our school\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party. She could have brought glory to our class! This is all my fault for not discovering her talent earlier. I would like to apologize to her for this major oversight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, who did not ignored her in the class besides Lao Qiu?</p><br/><p>She was ignored by the class, even though she had passed the major examinations with flying colors, for so many times. However, no one should be blamed for this as she carried the \u201chalo of the side character,\u201d didn\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>After Lao Qiu came up with this conclusion, the class was officially dismissed. They were not going be classmates anymore, after lunch.</p><br/><p>Han Leng could not help but ask her, \u201cHow did you do that? How did you know \u2018her\u2019 style?\u201d</p><br/><p>He has dumbfounded again after seeing Zhao Youyue\u2019s bright smile. It made him think of Chu Luoxun from his novel!</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, he would never relate Zhao Youyue to Chu Luoxun. For him, it was just a fluke shot, unless she plays it again</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all because of loveI must perform with the zeal to move my own heart, only then can I move the audiences, and try my best to express emotion through music. That would be enough.\u201d Zhao Youyue answered him with a straight face. In this state, she was far more vocal and open about giving musical tips.</p><br/><p>Of course, Han Leng would never take such a convincing role-play seriously</p><br/>\n</div>"}

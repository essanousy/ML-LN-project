He was an art student; time was a luxury he could spare.</p><br/><p>Sadly, this hardcore fan had been watching the live broadcasts for free. \u201cFishball\u201d gifts could be obtained through missions at no cost, yet they were too troublesome for him. His efforts could be seen from those passionately spammed \u201c666\u201d on her live stream bullet curtains, or where he provided the definition of each term and would answer questions asked by random people on B site Channel, a page where some \u201cAh Yu\u201d performances had been uploaded.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu\u2019s talent was not merely restricted to modern music. She broke down the boundaries of typical Classical Music and planted a bit of herself in them.</p><br/><p>It all fell on Hang Yongming\u2019s shoulders as a hardcore fan to reveal and interpret such sophisticated details to the ordinary audience.</p><br/><p>Apparently, these classical pieces whetted the audiences\u2019 appetite much better after tempered with Ah Yu\u2019s personality; some even thought that was the right way to play those pieces.</p><br/><p>If those memorable composers knew what Ah Yu did to their masterpieces, they might even jump out from their coffins, who permitted her to mutilate them so?</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming however, was one who despised those so-called authorities who standardized classic music. She did what Hang Yongming thought was right. Rigid judiciary systems that were based on those standards made music competitions loathsome. Music was supposed to be free and alive, just like Ah Yu and Chu Luoxun!</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming had placed Ah Yu as the real-life Chu Luoxun in his heart. His \u201cmusical path\u201d was dedicated to Beautiful April.</p><br/><p>Regardless of how ridiculous it sounded to learn music from a novel, Leng Zi\u2019s understanding and experiences of music had convinced Hang Yongming that Leng Zi had to be a part of the music industry!</p><br/><p>Inspired by the descriptions of Chu Luoxun\u2019s music, Hang Yongming believed that the musical path prescribed by the novel, had to be exactly like Chu Luoxun, for that was real music!</p><br/><p>He tried to follow Chu Luoxun\u2019s footsteps in the music competitions he participated. Unfortunately, not only did the audience not applause for him, the judges\u2019 commentaries were harsh and cold</p><br/><p>As he grew cynical towards almost everything, he started to scorn the gold medalist of the provincial level musical competition, the finalist of the national music competition, that judges\u2019 golden child, Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>He denounced the musical path of Zhao Youyue, famous Ah Yu was all the support he needed!</p><br/><p>For some time, Ah Yu stopped her broadcasts and left Hang Yongming anxious, afraid that she would never go live again.</p><br/><p>The bizarre claim of Ah Yu being cursed to death had never once concerned Hang Yongming. It had to be another of Ah Yu\u2019s weird roleplays. Besides, the woman viewed live-streams as something else entirely.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu was not a full-time anchor. She couldn\u2019t care less about money, and occasionally went live to top up some money in full view of the audience. \u201cMissy\u201d was the affectionately given name for a select variety of female anchors, but when it came to the one with the best lady-like temperaments, that would be Ah Yu.</p><br/><p>She was a very talented young girl, who was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. No matter what she invested her effort, she would always claim the top.</p><br/><p>Ah Yu also did some part-time VA. Even though that industry was ruthlessly competitive, Ah Yu\u2019s popularity had still broken through. She would surely end up as an idol voice actress with a decent income!</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming grew more anxious as he let his thoughts run wild, troubled by the possibility of Ah Yu fading away from the live broadcast scene. Who else could be his beacon of light?</p><br/><p>The violin\u2019s track that he had prepared for New Year\u2019s Eve Party was \u201cHappened to Meet You,\u201d composed by Ah Yu.This song was well-known by students across the school. He was confident that the first draw of his bow would send the crowd wild with excitement.</p><br/><p>If Hang Yongming\u2019s memory served him right, this pleasant piece of music was broadcasted on campus radio a few days ago. Those who heard of this song for the first time were moved by the rhythm, and immediately asked around the song.</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming had always been at forefront of the latest trends, and this was the current hit. Who else would be able to compare themselves to him on the New Year\u2019s Eve Party?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue?</p><br/><p>That woman thinks that she is Ah Yu. Was she even capable of composing a much more delicate and moving music piece than the one he was going to play?</p><br/><p>Impossible!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Hang Yongming did come across Ah Yu\u2019s latest Weibo post, claiming that she had postponed her live broadcast due to her preparations for New Year\u2019s Eve Party. His panic calmed down, for it was such a coincidence that he was occupied with the same matter.</p><br/><p>Wait, could Ah Yu be a high school student?</p><br/><p>No, universities held similar celebrations. Most of Ah Yu\u2019s followers had anticipated that it was most logical for her to be a university student.</p><br/><p>Hang Youming found an additional channel in Weibo, one that was recorded by a mobile phone. It was Ah Yu who was apologizing for not being able to broadcast live, while attempting to comfort her fans with Chu Luoxun\u2019s song named \u201cB Comme Brise.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no such person as Chu Luoxun. The only way to process this was that she had composed this song by herself. How much it differed from \u201cA Comme Amour\u201d remained to be seen.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, was it possible for this female anchor Ah Yu to play the piano? She had never once demonstrated it before</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming watched on, and was shocked to see the school uniform she was wearing!</p><br/><p>Her uniform was from his school! Yet, his mind so too crowded to realize that, for he was reeling from the revelation of Ah Yu being a high school student.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be mistaken; no university would have such a dull blue-and-white tracksuit uniform!</p><br/><p>Basically, there were no uniforms in universities, other than those well-known and famous institutions. Even if their uniforms were hideous, donning them on would be a great honor.</p><br/><p>Still, this did not look like a university uniform. It had to be a high school uniform!</p><br/><p>She was a high school student!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

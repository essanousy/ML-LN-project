There was no longer a reason for Su Li to decline, along with the fact that it was more than decent pay. Su Li also stood to gain much from this job, as there was no way that only one person was in charge of the illustration for such a large scale game. Before Su Li joined,already had many well-known illustrators, and it was why the game was still going strong.</p><br/><p>This game company had asked for Su Li\u2019s cooperation, mainly due to the overwhelming beauty of her illustrations. Only she could bring out the nameless maiden\u2019s swordplay, especially the skill \u2013 \u201cFlight of the Extra-celestial Fairy\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, they also took into account the fact that Su Shi\u2019s entire character design did not fit in such a dark and cold world background. The stark contrast would really make her stand out.</p><br/><p>All the prior main illustrators working for this game were well versed at depressing, oppressive, dark illustrations, which worked extremely well with guy characters, giving them an ikemen vibe. Yet, this did not roll well with female characters that made them seem even more detached from the players taking away their charm. Also, from the gaming trends, players never showed much interest in the female characters. Instead of improving their relationship with females, they would rather go around exploring and killing.</p><br/><p>The filthy rich creator Zha Feng motioned his hands, beckoning Su Li over. He briefed her over the game\u2019s main characters and the factors that needed to be changed, mainly the change in style for the main woman protagonist.</p><br/><p>In reality, all this needed some lengthy thought, as game art designs and illustrators were practically from different planets and were of different cultures. This was actually a test to see if Su Li would be able to adapt to the team.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s induction to the team would serve as great publicity. However, Old Man Zha Feng never once thought of using this as a means of advertising. He only intended to spill the beans after the DLC has been released.</p><br/><p>After all, when the game ends, their names would roll through the customary credits. Su Li\u2019s name would definitely pop up in bold letters when they reached the design team.</p><br/><p>Su Li herself was not advertising material, but her illustrations had practical use, especially her illustration of Yan QingMeng that turned her into a fairy.</p><br/><p>It would be unwise to use Su Li as promotion before the dust has settled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue trusted Su Li as usual. She believed that Su Li would do well as always. Su Li could serve as a reliable source of intel, if she worked there.</p><br/><p>To portray a person\u2019s essence in ink, one needed to know everything about the character, including their personality, experience, habits, minor quirks and etc, to create and illustrate the best possible rendition of a character.</p><br/><p>Due to this, Su Li would be able to find out if this nameless maiden was a measly side character, or a main character in disguise.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue\u2019s plans were foiled this time round. Due to how the company kept everything in wraps, she was not able to enter the company and learn everything from the inside. As a result, she never got to learn of the dark, sadistic mind that Zha Feng actually was.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue meddling was used by Zha Feng to the fullest. He could now show the players the extent of the dark Wuxia world.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was an actual, experienced gamer, and nothing would prepare her for Zha Feng\u2019s evil intent and tricks.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, all her hard-work of acting as the nameless maiden eventually got adopted.</p><br/><p>What she did not know was that Zha Feng had even added some extra scenes for the maiden, mainly in the form of flashbacks. \u201cThe gut-wrenching, heart-breaking feels,\u201d etc. Zha Feng was already treating the maiden like his own daughter.</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue claimed the fictional world as her stage, she had made sure to act as a girl who had grown up without a childhood, scarred by a tramatic past. However, Zha Feng had tweaked her characteristics ever so little, that she would give off many sad, precious memories that could be used to stimulate the tears of players.</p><br/><p>FengHuo gaming company\u2019s webpage hosted their interview with Tencent Gaming Platform. This interview could also be viewed on Tencent\u2019s platform. Players who followed FengHuo\u2019s gaming company through this platform might actually be more than what one might expect. Tencent Gaming Platform was somehow similar to Steam. Simply visiting it would lead one to an advertisement regarding the interview with FengHuo gaming company.</p><br/><p>From the video, a man in his thirties who sported black spectacles, and carried some excess weight around his weight could be seen with a warm smile while answering multiple questions in succession. His candid attitude cradled the feelings of players in its arms, spoiling them with love.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this new DLC, a female character called Yan Qingmeng would be introduced. This character has been created by our hardworking team. We noticed that Ye Huolian from the last DLC did not receive much attention, but were instead interested in the newly added skills and clothing. That left me a little saddened Our team had a hard time, as we had put a great deal of effort on the characters \u2013 while implementing new features such as the \u201cMy Room\u201d function, increasing the variety of weapons, etc. I know that many players see this game as \u201cHero of Equipment Changing,\u201d but\u201d</p><br/><p>As Zha Feng spoke endlessly about the new DLC, many comments started popping up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Hero of Equipment Changing??? More like \u2013 Hero of Pain!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWitch Ye Huolian\u2019s story might lack feels, but compared to the earliest main girl, Cheng Shan or Luo Shiqi, there was a vast improvement. Let\u2019s just hope that Yan Qingmeng would come as a surprise to players.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anyone actually care about the story? All that happens in this game is: choose a waifu and dress her up. That\u2019s where the real game is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI get the feeling that Thief Zha Feng has something up his sleeves. But as a loyal follower of , I\u2019d get any DLC that comes my way to experience it firsthand. Since Mr. Thief\u2019s games are not that expensive and are always wholesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really like Fenghuo gaming company\u2019s works myself, and I definitely feel the effort the team gave in creating the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDiligently create the game? More like diligently designed the CGs [1]!\u201d</p><br/><p>By the end of the video, a 3D illustration of Yan Qingmeng and her in-game 3D model was revealed. It featured Yan Qingmeng \u2013 sitting by the side of the Peak of the Emperor\u2019s Step as the setting sun half obscured by the clouds, glowed in the background. It was truly divine.</p><br/><p>Without questioning, Su Li took up the job. She started by being in charge of Yan Qingmeng. What she did not know was that Yan Qingmeng was just a decoy; a smokescreen for the real main character to hide behind.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s godlike skills produced a \u2018simple by her standards\u2019 illustration of Yan Qingmeng. It sent the viewers into a frenzy. In her basic, simple robe, she already possessed such beauty. If her favorability was maxed out, and you unlocked all the costumes, to what realm would her beauty ascend to?</p><br/><p>TL Notes:</p><br/><p>[1] CGI : Computer-generated imagery.

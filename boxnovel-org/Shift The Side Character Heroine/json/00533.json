He has some off-site accommodation. I can only say that he\u2019s indeed a famous writer,\u201d replied Du Hang.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had not expected that. Still, Han Leng was indeed very famous now. He was the combination of Han Han and Guo Jingming of the other world. It would not be too surprising for him to rent a high-grade apartment outside. He would have the space, time and peace to write.</p><br/><p>After all, Han Leng was not here to make friends. Friends were just as useful as studying. They all served no purpose. However, walking within the halls of a university may grant him some inspiration for a new book\u2026</p><br/><p>Most importantly, Lady Zhao had chosen this university, and this department. Thus, Han Leng had followed suit, knowing full well that it would not make any progress on his attempts to distance himself from her.</p><br/><p>Han Leng finally decided to maintain just the right distance. Give the Lady her space, do not get her suspicious, do not get her annoyed. That would all be enough.</p><br/><p>Many people had seen Zhao Youyue and Du Hang having a long chat. They noticed such a scene, not because of Zhao Youyue, but Du Hang the loner.</p><br/><p>The heterogeneous Du Hang would always get noticed due to his extreme, lone ranger vibe. This was the other extreme of being distinct.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, such people did not seek for attention by this manner. If one ever yearned for attention, they could always turn to move conventional methods like talents, academics, appearance, etc.</p><br/><p>Du Hang\u2019s appearance was by not means ugly. Girls would never turn him away. It was then \u2013 people started noticing a girl walking beside him\u2026</p><br/><p>Huh\u2026 This girl\u2026 She seems to be from our class as well.. Wait.. What was her name?</p><br/><p>Think damnit, think\u2026 Oh, Her name is Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026 Why did we not notice her during the self-introduction session? She\u2019s such a cute and beautiful, pure-looking girl. She\u2019s a natural beauty, we don\u2019t even see a speck of makeup on her face! She has the right to look down on us, right?</p><br/><p>Shocked! Why is there such a beautiful girl hiding in the class? Why did I subconsciously ignore her just now? Who is she to that loner? Are they actually a couple?</p><br/><p>Many students in the class finally noticed Zhao Youyue, only because they had noticed Du Hang first. Such thoughts started emerging in their heads.</p><br/><p>The over friendly Zhang Xiang could not help speaking to Han Leng, \u201cMaster Han Leng, I just only realized that He Weiwei\u2019s not the only beauty in class, we actually have one of those natural beauties here! She really seems very simple and honest. Such a girl would be easy pickings, right? I hope she\u2019s not already taken by Du Hang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Leng had been avoiding making eye contact with Zhao Youyue. He was afraid that he would not be able to hide his guilt. He still very much regretted his impulsive behavior before the college entrance exams. He feared that he had already ruined Lady Zhao\u2019s reputation. Ever since that incident, he did not even have the guts to face her. The desire of inviting her to the independent bookstore where they could share their mutual love for bookstore at him. But he had fought his other self with tooth and nail to hold himself back.</p><br/><p>Another girl might consider him a cold, violent maniac. Who the heck breaks all ties due to the slightest of disagreements?</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue would never go that far. She was not even bothered about anything that happened right before the college entrance exam, as she had been lost in the Xu Jing character card. That girl had possessed Lady Zhao, turning her into a studious freak. She had no extra energy to be concerned about the chaos on the internet.</p><br/><p>By the time the college entrance exams ended, all the hype had died down. Zhao Youyue had turned her attention over to the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d She had placed a lot of effort into shaping the iconic character card \u2013 Jane Doe Su. To an extent, she had almost entirely disassociated herself from reality.</p><br/><p>She had not jumped to conclusions when Han Leng fell silent. She had only believed that he had been focused on the writing of his new book\u2026</p><br/><p>Now that Zhang Xiang had brought her up, Han Leng took the opportunity to finally gaze at Zhao Youyue. He forced himself to remain calm and stiffly turned towards her. He spotted her walking beside a guy who was exuding a solitude and rotten sense. Lady Zhao was doing more listening than anything else. She had always been a silent listener. That guy did not seem to be running out of words anytime now.</p><br/><p>Han Leng did not like what he was seeing, even though he knew just how ice cold Lady Zhao was. She only seemed to be approachable on the surface. Males should be of no interest to her. Even so, Han Leng could not completely convince himself of that.</p><br/><p>Just as he got nervous with himself, he quickly shook the thought away. \u201cWhat rights do I have to deserve her anyway?\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides, if Zhao Youyue had really fallen in love with someone, he would be somewhat relieved. He could finally move on.</p><br/><p>Bookish youths like Han Leng admired such girls the most. Stubborn, unobtainable girls who went about their own path. Falling in love with him would actually be a disappointment. Everything he had thought he knew about her would shatter. Her falling in love with him would quickly kill off his interest.</p><br/><p>How unreasonable and irrational these talented writers were. Han Leng loved the Goddess who did not love anyone, forever independent. Du Hang wanted \u201creal things.\u201d He considered 90% of the relationships between couples to be fake.</p><br/><p>Of course Han Leng would be a loner. No girl could get close to him, and the one girl he actually admired would lose her charm if she actually reciprocated his feelings. Du Hang was another loner. He disdained pleasing others. Beautiful girls were nothing in his eyes, only shards of fake images that he had already deconstructed in his mind. The perfect, genuine girls only appeared in his writings. Of course, if such a girl actually existed in reality, she would live a most painful existence.</p><br/><p>Writers truly loved such scenarios. Reality was imperfect. Reality had no girls for them to take. Thus, their pens could create girls of their own.</p><br/><p>Ordinary folk would most certainly consider these eccentric thoughts to be that of a loser in denial. They had no girl to call their own, thus they could only fantasize. What a pity\u2026</p><br/><p>This was exactly why they were ordinary people, not writers.</p><br/><p>Of course, most writers just ordinary folk. They only treated writing as an occupation. But they were not living. They were merely existing, even if they wrote well; even if their income reached six digits, seven, or seventy.</p></div>\n</div>"}

One of them was \u201cBeautiful April\u201d which had just finished its publication. Many readers had finally walked out from their sorrow following Goddess Chu\u2019s death. Now, it was the analysis and quarrel amongst all kinds of \u201caestheticians\u201d stage.</p><br/><p>The first person to cause an uproar was an \u201caesthetician,\u201d a Doujinshi writer from the \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 fan club. He had written something about the so-called \u201cTrue Ending.\u201d It could also be considered as a fanfic continuation of \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d</p><br/><p>His writings would be incomparable to the genius writer, Leng Zi. However, his had treated the male protagonist and heroine far worse than Leng Zi. It could have been said to achieve what most members of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 fan club was hoping for!</p><br/><p>He made a direct deduction of the true ending, according to the original. The male protagonist and the heroine would never ever be together! It was too early for the Lin Meiyue fan club to be happy!</p><br/><p>Within this \u201cTrue Ending,\u201d the heroine Lin Meiyue was exposed for usurping Chu Luoxun\u2019s original works. Even though she had insisted that it was Chu Luoxun who entrusted them to her, she had no proof. She ended up losing all her standing and reputation. The title \u201cGenius Composer\u201d belonged to her no more.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan did not care if the heroine Lin Meiyue was not a genius. He was simply very disappointed. She had actually kept such a secret from him\u2026</p><br/><p>The male protagonist Gu Yuan increasingly missed Chu Luoxun. He started sorting out all her compositions. Through these music compositions, he finally realized that Chu Luoxun had loved him deeply. As she was too ill to finish a journey together with him, she had chosen to send Lin Meiyue in as a substitution of herself. She had allowed Lin Meiyue to love Gu Yuan on her behalf. Only then could she rest in peace.</p><br/><p>Her feelings had already been exposed through the song \u201cAngel\u2019s Wings.\u201d Only Gu Yuan had been dense about it. Even the song \u201cSweet,\u201d was a love song dedicated to Gu Yuan. It was certainly not written according to the sweet first love between Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun\u2019s heart had always been experiencing endless pain, yet she was too strong for her own good. Therefore, she had composed the song \u201cLeaving Sorrow to Myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The song \u201cHappened to Meet You,\u201d she left to Gu Yuan, was actually her confession, in the form of dying message. She had loved him for ten years, yet eventually, \u201cThe wind blew, the flowers dropped, tears like raindrops.\u201d She never wanted to be separated from the male protagonist, yet she was forced to leave</p><br/><p>In short, this \u201cTrue Ending\u201d had been written entirely according to the analysis of many members of \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 gang on her original songs. It was further analyzed according to the foreshadowing left by Leng Zi. This was extremely uplifting to the Chu Luoxun fan club.</p><br/><p>The Lin Meiyue fan club was understandably furious about this matter, \u201cYou guys are too much. You\u2019re all mad because the male protagonist and the heroine ended up being together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys even destroyed Chu Luoxun\u2019s image entirely. She sincerely hoped for the two of them to be together. She was totally selfless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to your imaginations, she has become a female supporting role who had loved the male protagonist. What\u2019s the point of her being Chu Luoxun? Are you saying that she would be the \u2018antagonist mistress,\u2019 had she been healthy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Lin Meiyue\u2019 fan club harbored its own \u201caestheticians\u201d. They started to retaliate with their own Doujinshi articles. It had been a hypothesis, according to Chu Luoxun fan club\u2019s analysis. It was about how the plot would have developed, if Chu Luoxun was not sick\u2026</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, Chu Luoxun had become a \u2018mistress\u2019 who had the appearance of Madonna, while hiding an insidious heart, eventually managing to destroy the perfect first love between the male protagonist and the heroine. She had successfully become the \u2018mistress,\u2019 at the cost of her perfect image!</p><br/><p>In short, even if the Lin Meiyue fan club dies off or gets nailed shut in their coffins, they would still cry out the name \u201cChu Luoxun, the mistress\u201d!</p><br/><p>The Chu Luoxun fan club would never let go of the matter of Lin Meiyue usurping Chu Luoxun\u2019s original compositions. They kept repeating the phrase \u201cMeiyue B*tch,\u201d ignoring the fact that it was Chu Luoxun who gave all the songs to Lin Meiyue, willingly.</p><br/><p>It was all-out war. \u201cBeautiful April\u201d soon attained great fame. After all, there have been so many lurkers on the internet. They needed to make some preparations before joining the battle.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they must read the novel. Among these lurkers, there were some Weibo big Vs[1], Douban[2] bosses, and high Gods of Zhihu[3]. Su Li was not the only person who knew how to gain attention. Since this youth novel was now so famous, it was evident that a movie adaptation would soon follow. How will they be worthy of their own public identities, if they do not take the opportunity to share the spotlight?</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful April\u201d had been wonderfully written. Its depictions of classical music were incredible; it was as if the readers could actually hear the music from words!</p><br/><p>With the inclusions of so many bosses, the flames of war would turn into rapid nukes. For example, a certain famous literary critic soon wrote an article with a grand theme \u2013 \u2018what is true love?.\u2019 It had been written according to \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d The conclusion was that only Chu Luoxun\u2019s forever selfless dedication could be considered as \u2018the\u2019 true love. Lin Meiyue would only be expressing a secular desire of possession.</p><br/><p>The literary critic was eventually categorized into the \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 gang. Why not just admit being a fan of Chu Luoxun? There is no need to take things by such a roundabout fashion.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t you ever think that the Lin Meiyue fan club is so easily fooled!</p><br/><p>Some \u2018aestheticians\u2019 were ever more outrageous. After conducting some analysis, they concluded that Chu Luoxun\u2019s true love was actually Lin Meiyue. She had written those songs to Lin Meiyue, not Gu Yuan, since the beginning. She actually hated Gu Yuan for stealing Lin Meiyue away from her!</p><br/><p>A number of readers actually found such an analysis reasonable. Master Leng Zi is the one to be blamed. He had never clearly stated Chu Luoxun\u2019s innermost thoughts, only her actions.</p><br/><p>Perhaps only Leng Zi himself knew Chu Luoxun\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>Such ambiguity is destined to bring forth various readers\u2019 analysis on Chu Luoxun\u2019s intentions, resulting in different conclusions. After all, \u2018there are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand readers\u2019 eyes[4].\u2019 Therefore, it is not an exaggeration at all to have a thousand Chu Luoxuns as well!</p><br/><p>Such is the charm of an iconic character. Even if she died within the literary world, she would live forever within the readers\u2019 hearts, always receiving their support.</p><br/><p>As \u201cBeautiful April\u201d experienced a spike in sales, another matter rose, causing similarly great waves. This matter was closely related to Zhao Youyue as well!</p><br/><p>It was a headliner on the media, mentioning that the VA for the most well-known female character \u2018Yu Shengfan,\u2019 chosen by the animation production group of \u201cThe strongest King,\u201d was not the experienced VA \u2018Ding Hui\u2019 from the rumors, but an unknown, completely newbie VA!</p><br/><p>The Xiao Yu fans took up arms. They asked the production group to justify their reasons for choosing a newbie as Xiao Yu\u2019s VA. Wouldn\u2019t she ruin the character instead?</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Weibo Big V \u2013 Weibo Big V refers to the authenticated users on Weibo.

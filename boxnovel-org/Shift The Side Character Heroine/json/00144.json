However, the fans who were watching the interview were overjoyed. They kept spamming the sentences \u201cRosemary, thief\u201d, \u201cGive me back Little fish\u201d to create a bullet curtain on the screen. It showed that everyone was pretty upset and held grudges against Rosemary for killing off the character Yu Shengfan.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai scratched his head nervously while telling the truth, \u201cDidn\u2019t I mention before that this character Yu Shengfan came to life in my writings? At one point, I realized that I could not proceed, because her soul had vanished. Moreover, I could only write in such a way in order to develop the story further. I did not want to destroy the character by half-*ssing and forcing something out, because l loved her that much\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, is that why you murdered the character?\u201d The emcee asked abruptly. Apparently, the emcee was also a fan of little fish.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do not put it that way. I did let her live on in the hearts of the readers, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Ye Hai replied with a guilty conscience.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai had simply used the explanation of further developing the story to push away the responsibility. Actually, he had wanted to kill the character Yu Shengfan off anyway. He had no choice but to do so, having lost his source of inspiration. However, he had created grandiose reasons and the importance of killing the character Yu Shengfan to fool the readers. One of it, was for Lin Feng to develop as a character and to develop the story.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai was indeed a sly fox, one who was very experienced in deception. Compared to Su Li who was cute and stupid, he was truly a master.</p><br/><p>Right now, it was the emcee who was stunned because he had never seen such a reason</p><br/><p>At that moment, many shameless people started to create a bullet curtain. A lot of readers knew that Rosemary was going to bear the title of a thief, for sure. The influence he created by killing the character Yu Shengfan was no less than the influence of another author who killed the character \u201cUesugi Erii\u201d from another world.</p><br/><p>Besides, the reason for Rosemary killing a character off just because he did not want to destroy its image, would soon become an iconic excuse. He loved her too much, hence he had to kill her off. This could be compared to the trick Urobuchi Gen applied in \u201cLove Warriors\u201d.</p><br/><p>Ye Hai continued to say shamelessly, \u201cAs for my cutest, prettiest female reader, she chose to forgive me. Even though I killed her cameo character, I managed to write her requested cameo to the level of a female lead by giving her extra scenes in the story. That\u2019s right; I did consider letting Yu Shengfan be the female protagonist because she matched well with Lin Feng. They are the only characters who understand each other the most in my novel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why you didn\u2019t let her be the female protagonist in the end? Can I say that you are agreeing with the Fujoshi readers? After all, they are more willing to see a brotherhood of two male characters, instead of a love story between the male and female protagonist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. In my opinion, those who love my novel are my readers; regardless of them being Otaku or Fujoshi readers. The reason of her not being the female protagonist is because I am not very good at writing romance. Besides, I have found a trick to creating a female character.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Can you share the trick with all of us, Rosemary Sensei?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not a problem. Actually, it was that gorgeous reader who gave me this trick. As I quote, \u2018since you are so good with male characters, all you have to do is to describe a male character and change the sex to female\u2019. For instance, there is this beautiful, moe female character in a comic, only for me to insist that she is a boy. If I use the same method to describe a female character without any love scenes, then I can portray a similar yet still amazing female character.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is wonderful! You are good indeed, Rosemary sensei. The female characters that you created afterward all had distinctive personalities. It seems that your method is very effective! However, I believe that other authors will be envious of you to have such a great female reader, when they hear of this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I guess, I am quite lucky for her to love my work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, was the character Yu Shengfan created via this method?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, she is the only character that I created as a real female character. I can feel that she is a girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you are an author, once you have feelings for your work or characters, it is very easy to enter a state where you get drowned in your own inspiration. You are able to resonate with your favorite character, thus allowing you to write a really good iconic novel! That\u2019s why, I don\u2019t think any of you will believe me when I say that I cannot control my hands when I\u2019m writing about Yu Shengfan. Words will appear on their own, forming sentences regarding Yu Shengfan, and there is not a single spelling error in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things that Rosemary sensei say are really mysterious. This is indeed the style that a High God writer should have. Lastly, is there anything else you want to add?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to say that, lately, more and more authors have chosen to enter this industry, due to the advanced development of webnovels. If you are doing this for the money, it\u2019s better to find a more secure and future promising job. Writing requires that you devote your love into it. Then, you will be blessed by the goddess of literature and truly enjoy the fun in this line of work. Moreover, you will get real fans, your soul will find its own inspiration, and you will form your own godly expertise. If you write novels with nothing but money in mind, you may earn more than those who write with love, for a short period of time. In the long term, you will have more loss than profit. That is all I have to say. I hope that everyone listens to my advice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rosemary\u2019s interview video was a success, and his reputation was boosted further to another level. At the same time, the iconic female character Yu Shengfan, was mentioned again. In any case, he was sure to keep a firm grip on the title \u201cRosemary thief\u201d. Truth be told, in the hearts of every thief, they would actually be proud and happy to have such a title.</p><br/><p>However, Rosemary\u2019s last words did start a controversy. A lot of online writers who wrote to put food on table started to insult that Rosemary was only showing off after earning some money. Was money earned from business novels dirtier than the money earned from your passionately written novels? If love is so lucrative, I should even be able to use love to generate electricity!</p><br/><p>As Rosemary\u2019s number one Section Master, Zhao Youyue too had become quite famous. Her Weibo even gained a few thousand followers. Sadly, even though she loved to browse through Weibo pages, she rarely posted on it. She had no intention of showing off her wealth and some beatified pictures. Otherwise, it would not be a problem for her to have at least ten thousand followers.</p><br/><p>Many readers from \u201cThe strongest king\u201d were very excited when Rosemary said that \u201cYouyue was the original model he had for Yu Shengfan\u201d. They all kept asking about her gaming skills, and whether she would become very talkative, complete with a venomous tongue while playing?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not reply. She wanted to let the truth speak for itself!</p><br/><p>She had been busy setting up the necessary hardware for a live-stream. A three dimensional Yu Shengfan was about to show up soon!</p>\n</div>"}

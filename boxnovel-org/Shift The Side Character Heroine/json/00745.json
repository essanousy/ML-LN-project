Many of Su, The Great Deity fans were excited by the fact that it was Endless Apocalypse.</p><br/><p>With Su Li\u2019s current status in the manga industry, a press conference would be held whenever she publishes a new product. In the press conference, many characters would show up in life-sized posters and be distributed to lucky fans in the audience.</p><br/><p>As per Lady Zhao\u2019s instructions, the character emphasized by Su Li were not the protagonists and members of the main cast, but the beautiful scientist Zhang Yanwei. In the novel, her beauty was never described in detail. All that was mentioned was her pretty face and outstanding temperament. Despite being in her mid-thirties, throngs of suitors still chased after her. Her charm was no lesser than those half her age.</p><br/><p>Under Su Li\u2019s brush, the beautiful Zhang Yanwei came to life. Her figure was perfectly proportioned, portraying the charm of mature women.</p><br/><p>Su Li\u2019s talent when it came to beautifying a female character was undisputed. Even her clothes carried so much life in them as they caught the magical wind that surrounded all anime characters, armed with a charisma that no words could describe. The white coat and the black stockings perfectly matched the character, everything seemed harmonious and perfect.</p><br/><p>When Zhang Yanwei\u2019s life-sized poster was brought onstage, screaming otakus unanimously decided on their newest waifu. They did not even bother reading the original novel of Endless Apocalypse, they did not have to. Let\u2019s begin our praise and worship.</p><br/><p>\u201cSu, The Great Deity has created my new wife. That white coat! Those black stockings! It\u2019s almost too perfect to be true. I just want Zhang Yanwei\u2019s original silk stockings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am looking forward to Su Li\u2019s new work. Simple reason being that Zhang Yanwei is absofreakinlutely beautiful. I never thought that Su Li would ever produce such a mature beauty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy her appearance alone, I could tell that she\u2019s probably a doctor or scientist. And those underqualified jokers are already calling her their wife. This community is doomed! Oh, just a simple question here. When is the artbook coming out?</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho. You\u2019re all jumping on the bandwagon to a certain hell, aren\u2019t you? Did it not occur to you that your wife would die soon? What happened to your last wife? She died, betrayed from all sides, stabbed in the back, in the heart! She died as a pincushion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, this is just like that lame reply in the forum that mentioned some gibberish about \u2018auspicious imperial immunity will be granted to secure her safety.\u2019 Why would someone take a special case as a norm that must happen to every character? I bet this Zhang Yanwei would never be removed from the story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, you\u2019re calling for a bet now? Alright, name it. What\u2019s your wager? Though I haven\u2019t read \u201cEndless Apocalypse,\u201d that name alone is suggesting some batshit levels of infinite doomsday. I won\u2019t be surprised if she appears as a cameo in the first episode and gets crushed by a meteorite within 10 seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a veteran online reader. Perhaps none of you manga freaks know that the original author of this work, Master PhD. She\u2019s a lunatic who kills off her characters like no tomorrow. Make any one of her characters too popular, that poor thing would be dead in the next few chapters. Welcome to a dose of PhD.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A typhoon was raging among the fans. Obviously, Su Li was a star in the manga world. It was no wonder that so many original authors would want to work with Su Li. Perhaps they did not think their original work to be good enough, so it was time to rely on Su Li\u2019s blind, crazed, loyal fans.</p><br/><p>Su Li was now turning Endless Apocalypse into a manga. The biggest beneficiary, of course, was Master PhD.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, that novel never rose above the triple digit in the rankings. Lady Zhao had invested a great deal of effort for it to reach that rank, even throwing a few white silver ranked gifts into the mix. If Master PhD had not cheated Lady Zhao of an easy victory, Zhao Youyue might have actually donated a few gold-ranked gifts for it. Zhao Youyue believed that once she has \u201cChu Xuan\u2019s\u201d character card, she could easily convert a few Dark Technologies from the manga and make a change in reality. Then she will monopoly the market and harvest a great fortune out of it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not think that a few silver ranked gifts was a large amount. She could not comprehend why readers were making a fuss out of it. Some readers even claim her to be an advertising account, trying to boost the popularity of certain author in the major rankings. They believed that her strategy was to lead the common people into donating gifts to the author. At the end of the month, her gifts would be refunded in full, while donations from the common folk would be split into a seventy-thirty ration. This was highly common in the industry.</p><br/><p>All of Zhao Youyue\u2019s donations were authentic. However, she never once revealed that her family was one of this online platform\u2019s shareholders. Every year, her family would receive a dividend from the company profits. The more the company earned, the bigger their cut.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the top officials of this Qidian novel platform always honored the presence of Lady Zhao. They even customized her account\u2019s profile beyond the options of regular VIPs. Such were the privileges of a wealthy tycoon. If their account looked just like any other, how could they feel above and beyond?</p><br/><p>With great effort from Lady Zhao, the novel made it into the double digits. With great effort from Su Li, even more curious readers fell into the trap. The subscribe button was mangled beyond repair.</p><br/><p>Unlike cheap booze that climaxed in every chapter, simple-minded readers would not enjoy such an excellent novel in just one or two chapters. When the taste of this premium wine finally sunk in, readers would want more!</p><br/><p>You would barely remember any of the characters in cheap booze. They would only be paying attention to the protagonist, watching how he beat anyone who opposed him, and how he enjoyed the company of ladies. However, even the side characters of this masterpiece had more depth than the protagonists of those cheap novels. Its plot line was a contortionist, twisting the twists until your brain twists itself around those twists. Each time, the readers would be blown into orbit\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, Master PhD had started on the third iteration of the apocalypse. Global evolution had removed humans from the top of the food chain and flung them down to the bottom of the food pyramid. Her writing was at its highest at the moment.</p><br/><p>This third apocalyptic world powered a tsunami on the internet. On Qidian, officials granted Lady Zhao a special advertising plan, with the best promotional offer ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cEndless Apocalypse,\u201d we\u2019re headed for the moon! Zhang Yanwei, the incredibly beautiful scientist is about to start her brilliant life!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

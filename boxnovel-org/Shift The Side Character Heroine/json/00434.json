Speaking of which, how was it made? And those scenes, how were they shot?\u201d Han Leng asked, still traumatized.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis film had been completely made with CGI. Everything was CGI, including the people in it,\u201d Zhao Youyue lied through her teeth.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had no intentions of giving a clear explanation. No matter what she tries, she would never come up with anything remotely credible. When the \u201cactors\u201d see the film and think of their \u201cdreams,\u201d they would be most perplexed. How did their dreams make it on the big screen?</p><br/><p>When Han Leng heard this, he was speechless for a moment. However, he was really gullible, and believed everything he heard. He lamented, \u201cCGI these days are really incredible About this film it had perfect camerawork and terrific soundtrack. It was freakishly scary, despite the horrendous plot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li completely agreed, saying that this was the scariest horror movie that she had ever seen. However, she still had many questions. How was this film really shot? Since when was CGI this advanced?</p><br/><p>After Zhao Youyue listened to both of them, she felt that their views had been very relevant. In short, this was a film that was top-notch in some aspects but had a very bad plot.</p><br/><p>If this film was to be shown in the cinemas, the box office would surely get caught up in a debacle. It might be better if she published it on the internet. If it provided her with some energy, that would be more than enough.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue decisively uploaded the film to several major video websites. Of course, she also uploaded it onto the Source World website. She had decided to publish all her experiences in the supernatural source worlds on the website in the real world. \u201cChronicles of the Peculiar Black Cat\u201d would surely become a series with a cult following.</p><br/><p>Of course, \u201cChronicles of the Peculiar Black Cat\u201d did not instantly gain much attention. Zhao Youyue did not go out of her way to publicize it, neither did she advertise the film with her live streamer identity\u2026</p><br/><p>However, pure gold always found a way to shine. It took next to not time at all before some fanatical horror film enthusiasts came upon it. Of course, we can imagine how they reacted to it. On their own accord, they started dragging more of their peers to join them in their pit!</p><br/><p>This was how they tried to make more people fall into the pit \u2014- \u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a realistic horror film. You\u2019d think that you were at the scene!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tired of mainstream horror, I recommend that you try \u201cChronicles of the Peculiar Black Cat.\u201d You\u2019ll learn what real horror is. If you\u2019ve watched it and don\u2019t find it scary, feel free to punch me in the face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, the plot was horrible, but the scenes and the acting were amazing. People would be convinced that it was based on a completely true story, but considering the use of various shooting styles and camera angles, it\u2019s definitely a movie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA very strange movie indeed. I really can\u2019t figure out why such a movie would appear on the internet. How could such a legend appear on the internet like it was nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>More fell into the pit. If they disabled the bullet curtains while watching, they would certainly find the movie to be extremely scary. Watching this movie made people start questioning on the legitimacy of ghosts!</p><br/><p>Any type of film would be enjoyable if people watched it on Bilibili. The bullet curtains brought everything to life. Even \u201cChronicles of the Peculiar Black Cat\u201d was no exception. It would no longer be anywhere as scary as before as the bullet curtain would be courteous enough to give readers a headsup with messages like \u201cHere it comes!\u201d and \u201cBe prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>The increasing popularity of \u201cChronicles of the Peculiar Black Cat\u201d on the internet triggered Zhao Youyue\u2019s \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d Once again, it prematurely left its cooldown state. Indeed, the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d which led to the random world of works was still in cooldown. However, \u201cAltair\u2019s card\u201d always left a path open to source worlds. That way, Zhao Youyue could always revisit the Supernatural Source World.</p><br/><p>Take note that the supernatural source worlds were currently unable to grant Zhao Youyue any new abilities. They could only replenish the countdown timer of Zhao Youyue\u2019s high popularity character cards. Originally, the \u201cHua Xiaomao\u201d character card had been close to expiring, but by virtue of Chu Renmei\u2019s previous offerings, it had been renewed. This also came as a pleasant surprise for Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>This called for a change of plans. She could not casually sacrifice the black cat card anymore, as she had originally planned. Otherwise, she would have nothing to rely on when she was in the supernatural source world.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could only describe this as \u201cmagical.\u201d It seemed to be a rather useless character card that could only be used to act cute. Now, it was literally her trump card in the supernatural source worlds</p><br/><p>\u201cChronicles of the Peculiar Black Cat\u201d had not yet reached the point where the internet loses itself over the film. Horror was still a relatively niche movie genre. Not many people in the world looked for ways of self-torture. This was especially due to the fact that this movie had been exaggerated to the point that it was now known as the most realistic horror movie in existence. It literally scared the weak-hearted away.</p><br/><p>However, some of the horror scenes in the movie had been made into GIFs. And most effectively did they prove themselves.</p><br/><p>Some mischievous people would directly insert a close-up shot of Chu Renmei\u2019s horrible face at the end of some mini-games on the internet. As players immersed themselves in the game, a horrifying face would suddenly appear on the screen!</p><br/><p>One could already imagine how they reacted. The normal reaction was to immediately stand up from the chair, move backward, and try to pull away from the screen. The most exaggerated kind of reaction, was, of course, throwing a punch that went right through the screen!</p><br/><p>Hence, the real world has ended up with many more interesting GIFs. It was interesting to note that an actual ghost from another world had been brought into the real world.</p><br/><p>Of course, due to the widespread publicity of \u201cChronicles of the Peculiar Black Cat,\u201d many people also started paying attention to the actors in it. Among the actors, fatty Liu Kang\u2019s amazing acting won him the spotlight. He was subject to heavy, lengthy debate. What drove this actor to act so convincingly?</p><br/><p>The discussion went on for a long time but, of course, it never concluded. The hunt for Liu Kang began. He acted like a God, so which other movies did he appear in?</p><br/><p>The search went fruitlessly for the longest while!</p><br/><p>Besides Liu Kang, the ghostly \u201cChu Renmei was everyone\u2019s favorite female lead. The side-character heroine went unnoticed, as always.</p><br/><p>Chu Renmei had been amazing. No other actor had ever played such a convincing ghost. She was just like the real thing!</p><br/><p>Then came another question. Who was the actress who played as Chu Renmei?</p><br/><p>Another manhunt ensued to no effect</p><br/><p>At that juncture, people started to sense that something was really wrong!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

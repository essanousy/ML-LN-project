She just wanted to live her life care-free, not worrying about anything. Since everything she wanted could just be bought with money, it had shattered her will to strive for a better life.</p><br/><p>Having experienced such difficulty with Rosemary, she contemplated becoming a famous editor in future, so that she was able reach out for the authors easily. It should be fairly easy to ask for a female cameo in their creations.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue thought that it would be a win-win situation if she could ever collaborate with the authors. She could get hold of an iconic character card, where the authors could enjoy great sales. Moreover, their novels would not have an unforgettable iconic character, wasn\u2019t that a great sense of achievement?</p><br/><p>Su Li arrived at the meeting spot before Zhao Youyue. She was wearing a two-year-old white puffer jacket adorned with a red scarf. She was obviously not so particular about clothing like Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>While waiting at the entrance of the coffee shop, she looked through her QQ chat history with tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d. Even though Zhao Youyue claimed that she was a female, she had never revealed any of her photos or voices, which put Su Li in doubt. Would there be a female reader who truly favored her \u201cPure Romance\u201d? She had even tipped her more than 5,000 RMB. Su Li could only think that she had a unique taste and lots of cash at her disposal.</p><br/><p>Su Li did not wait long before a limo coming slowly to her sight. It stopped at the entrance of the coffee shop. Su Li goggled in disbelief. Wasn\u2019t this the familiar scene of a rich daughter\u2019s arrival? She had thought this could only happen in novels or mangas.</p><br/><p>She had never expected that she could witness it in real life!</p><br/><p>She had always assumed that authors were exaggerating, because such an entrance would be ostentatious in reality.</p><br/><p>As Su Li was staring at the limo, the driver jogged to the rear and opened the door for the VIP. This scene looked even more familiar to Su Li.</p><br/><p>The person who gracefully came out from the limo was definitely Lady Zhao. She thanked Uncle Liu with gratitude, and went straight to the coffee shop. This mistress with ponytail certainly caught the eyes of many.</p><br/><p>Su Li was just one of the spectators, but she saw this lady was smiling and walking towards her. Could someone from lower-class like her know such a rich mistress? Her brain was freezing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNice meeting you, Master Su Li, I\u2019m your fan! My name is Zhao Youyue, I\u2019m in your care.\u201d She introduced herself as she stood elegantly in front of Su L. Her social skills were not bad at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cO, ooh\u2026 Nice meeting you too, my name is Su Li.\u201d She responded nervously and shook Zhao Youyue\u2019s smooth and fair hands right away. It almost felt like a commoner meeting up with the president of the state.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt a rough sensation on Su Li\u2019s hand, she was impressed as she knew Master Su Li was a hardworking person towards her art creations.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue guessed it right. While creating \u201cPure Romance\u201d, Su Li did not even stop working on her doujin releases. Born into a lower class, she would not slip any money earned from either normal works or doujin released. Her parents were farmers and she had two little sisters. She would always give 80 percent of her money earned from her artworks to her mother. Of course, she did not wish her sisters to experience a tough life like hers. Back then, Su Li was despised by anyone in school, but her family condition made her insecure. She felt unqualified for love and was afraid to be abandoned by someone she loved, despite having a pretty face.</p><br/><p>Later, she found her true love, which was drawing mangas! Her works were loved by thousands of fans, that was comparable to love, wasn\u2019t it? Plus, she could finally announce it to her family that she was a mangaka. Earlier on she had to make up that the money given to family came from her part-time jobs. Well, could she tell her family that she earned those money through drawing erotic mangas?</p><br/><p>After a brief greeting at the entrance, they entered the coffee shop. With Zhao Youyue by her side, Su Li felt like her shoulder and waist was straightened up as ever. Never would she have thought that she could have a rich fan like Zhao Youyue!</p><br/><p>Even though Su Li was not familiar with cars, but she knew that a limo costed approximately two to three million RMB at least. Looking at her entire outfit, Su Li guessed that even her boots could have worthed hundreds of the white puffer jacket she was wearing. Well, the white puffer jacket costed her only 200 RMB.</p><br/><p>However, Su Li had her mindset to make an acquaintance with Lazy Zhao, she must get on her good side.</p><br/><p>They both sat down facing each other, Su Li was no longer feeling nervous. Even though Lady Zhao was rich, she was still a fan after all. If only Su Li was a \u201cmale\u201d, she would never have to bother about money for the rest of her life. Of course, if she managed to get into a relationship with Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Obviously this was here mere daydream. If she really was a \u201cmale\u201d, Zhao Youyue might not even want to meet up with Su Li.</p><br/><p>Warming herself with a cup of hot latte, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve never expected my first Sect Master, Youyue-chan[1] will be coming out of a limo. It certainly surprised me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who doesn\u2019t enjoy compliments and pleasing of others? Zhao Youyue grinned.</p><br/><p>Still, she humbled herself, \u201cYou flatter me, Master Su. Actually, I have also never thought Master Su would look even prettier in real life than in photos. You can totally become a superstar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li quickly waved her hand in disagreement, \u201cI\u2019m not as beautiful as Youyue-chan, you have that elegant temperament, you\u2019re just like\u2026 like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly Zhao Youyue\u2019s facial expression turned impassive, mimicking Xu Jing\u2019s iconic deadpan look. Even though she did not activate \u201cXu Jing\u2019s possession\u201d mode, she could perfectly imitate Xu Jing after her frequent usage of the card.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like Xu Jing!\u201d, Su Li uttered suddenly as she looked at Zhao Youyue, then her face revealed a shocking expression.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Chan \u2013 .

If someone manages to play the song accurately, while showing off their techniques, that would be perfect for him.</p><br/><p>How hard would it be to perfectly match every beat and note of a music score?</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue appeared out of nowhere in this competition, she had given a huge surprise to He Wencheng!</p><br/><p>During the qualifiers, he was already amazed by the skills of Zhao Youyue in the designated song, and had asked the other judges about this girl and her past achievements, but she was completely unknown to them.</p><br/><p>Of course, the other judges were not able to answer him; they only told him she just recently got a grade ten in violin\u2026</p><br/><p>In the eyes of an average person, a grade ten in any musical instrument would be impressive for them; they would not be able to tell the difference because they were outsiders to that realm.</p><br/><p>But in the eyes of a professional, grade ten was an amateur\u2019s level. The level difference between music performers and grade ten was even greater than grade ten compared with an average person.</p><br/><p>This was just like those RPGs, leveling was easy in the beginning, but at the end of the game, gaining a level was much harder than raising ten levels in the beginning!</p><br/><p>After knowing a little bit more about Zhao Youyue, he had paid even more attention to her now. Did she practice her skills all the time and caused her to become a late bloomer, and has finally decided to take part in this competition?</p><br/><p>Judging by the way Zhao Youyue walked onto the stage, it was clearly not her first time performing on stage\u2026</p><br/><p>This made He Wencheng very confused, but it never prevented him from admiring Zhao Youyue at all. Her manner of performing, gave her utmost respect to composers like him!</p><br/><p>Now that they were in the finals, He Wencheng still favored Zhao Youyue the most. When she was able to play the designated song perfectly, he gave her the highest score, without any hesitation!</p><br/><p>When it came to her self-picked song \u201cI Palpiti,\u201d Zhao Youyue nailed the song completely and showed the judges the extent of her abilities!</p><br/><p>She had activated her \u201cXu Jing\u2019s card\u201d for this occasion, as \u201cXu Jing\u201d had a superior learning skill and a mind without any distractions, and when paired with her body\u2019s adaptive ability, allows her to play any song with absolute accuracy!</p><br/><p>After a song that lasted for more than ten minutes, Zhao Youyue was leftdrenched in sweat. Once again, she had experienced the hardship of Chu Luoxun in reality. She had insisted on performing with the main hero while dominated his piano performance, which was not an easy feat!</p><br/><p>After playing the final note with a perfect end, Zhao Youyue bowed deeply to the judges and audience, it was an amazing performance!</p><br/><p>The lead judge, He Wencheng stood up and clapped for Zhao Youyue in excitement, and the other judges followed suit. They were certain that the gold medal would go to Zhao Youyue. He Wencheng admired her that much!</p><br/><p>But the applause from the crowd was not as enthusiastic. Perhaps, they could not see as much as the judges do. But they had to admit that the self-picked song of Zhao Youyue\u2019s was indeed something else. She had shown her skills to the crowd, and those who were familiar with music knew that it was a complex piece. The others would only be able to judge it by its surface.</p><br/><p>It would be hard for those who were unfamiliar with violins to judge a song they do not know. When a violinist plays a song they are familiar with, even if it isn\u2019t particularly good, would garner their applause.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s parents were pleased with her performance, especially Wang Hua, \u201cMy little sloth finally has the qualifications to play a musical instrument with me, we could be the perfect combo of pianist and violinist!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi just gave a perfunctory nod, as a guy from a wealthy family, he knew a little bit about arts. He knew that his daughter\u2019s violin skill had already surpassed Wang Hua, at a professional level!</p><br/><p>He had no idea how his daughter had managed to acquired such extraordinary skill in a short time, but he realized that she had not won over the hearts of the audience with her spectacular skills\u2026</p><br/><p>As for Han Leng, he was enjoying himself; he had started off as an outsider to music. But whenever he is \u201cinspired\u201d to write \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d he had learned a lot more about music, and he had been driven to do his own research on that subject.</p><br/><p>Now he finally understood, what a real \u201cHumanoid Metronome\u201d was!</p><br/><p>At first, he wanted to find more inspiration for the character, \u201cLin Meiyue\u201d by watching Zhao Youyue participate in this music competition. Soon, he realized Zhao Youyue and \u201cLin Meiyue\u201d were two different people, other than the \u201cside character\u201d trait.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was only gentle in appearance, and she could flaunt that face without being embarrassed about it. However, a certain part of her demanded to be the center of attention!</p><br/><p>Han Leng realized that Zhao Youyue was actually more similar to Goddess Chu, her temperament, especially!</p><br/><p>As for her performance, there was no doubt about it, she was the violin version of \u201cGu Yuan\u201d!</p><br/><p>Han Leng was very satisfied, as if he now understood Zhao Youyue a little more\u2026</p><br/><p>After hearing the performance of Zhao Youyue, Hang Yongming fell silent, he had this indescribable feeling in his heart!</p><br/><p>The rage he felt earlier seemed to become a joke. With those skills of Zhao Youyue, did he have the qualification to judge that perfectly accurate song? Not every music performer could become a doll for the composer!</p><br/><p>But Hang Yongming stayed determined. Since Zhao Youyue was the female version of \u201cGu Yuan,\u201d why couldn\u2019t he become the male version of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d?</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming wanted to conquer the hearts of the audience in this theater!</p><br/><p>Finally, it was Hang Yongming\u2019s turn; he was the ninth contestant. He went up on stage with his black-frame spectacles, adjusted his trousers and exhaled heavily through his mouth, puffing his cheeks, as if it could improve his ability\u2026 only doing that to ease his nervousness.</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming had expressed himself!</p><br/><p>Everything was perfect!</p><br/><p>The reaction given by the audience was not bad either! The theater had become slightly livelier!</p><br/><p>But as it turned out\u2026</p><br/><p>He Wencheng expression turned dark because he had a foul temper, and in his position, he could publicly give anyone a scolding without holding back, \u201cEh eh eh! How are you playing the song? N, no! That tune, tune it properly before playing it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hang Yongming was stunned, this did not happen in the novel! You can\u2019t just interrupt my performance, just because you\u2019re the lead judge!</p><br/><p>He continued to play the violin in his own way!</p><br/><p>\u201cScram! Can you play that thing properly! Are you trying cause trouble?\u201d He Wencheng was furious, this brat was showing no respect to the piece, the ceremony, the judges!</p><br/><p>He Wencheng wanted to beat him up so badly, after listening to his racket!</p><br/><p>The fact was, Zhao Youyue had the ability to become the female version of \u201cGu Yuan,\u201d and acquire the title of \u201cHumanoid Metronome.\u201d But Hang Yongming was nowhere close to the standards of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the author of \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d Han Leng doubled over in laughter!</p>\n</div>"}

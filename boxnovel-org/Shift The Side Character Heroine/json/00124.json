However, in school, she was still that unnoticeable, ordinary side character. The only difference was that she was getting tons of benefits from her \u201ctop student\u201d status.</p><br/><p>All this while, she knew that her homeroom teacher Mr. Qiu and other passing students would think of her as a low-profile, quiet and obedient girl. They certainly did not know that deep in her heart, she was actually a troublemaker. She had already made her way, interfering with three literary works, and not to mention, two of them had produced quite an impact\u2026</p><br/><p>Anyhow, a majority of the students had read \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, included Wang Yang, the one seated in front of Zhao Youyue. He got to know about the book through Zhao Youyue\u2019s recommended book list. Of course, even Zhao Youyue had promoted the book in person. Although Zhao Youyue had lead Wang Yang to a certain level of shock, he had not reached the point where he hated Zhao Youyue for doing so. This was all because he was on good terms with Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, a majority of them did not know that the identity of tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d was actually Zhao Youyue herself, or else she would end up like Jiang Chao. She had stood up for Rosemary, claiming that his book would conclude with a nice and heart-warming grand finale. But then, what happened in the end?</p><br/><p>The exact opposite!</p><br/><p>Tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d was now under fire from numerous fans. They even labeled her book list as fraudulent and frivolous!</p><br/><p>On the book\u2019s review section, loads of people started talking about the unreliability of tycoon \u201cYouyue\u2019s\u201d recommended book list. Perhaps if you have warned everyone that Rosemary would mess things up beforehand, everyone would be keeping their mouths shut by now.</p><br/><p>Of course, quite a number of readers stood up for tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d. The one who was at fault was definitely Rosemary, not only did he lie to tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d, he had also messed up the main protagonist Lin Feng, too. Even so, there was still a sentence uttered by Lin Feng that broke everyone\u2019s heart</p><br/><p>I once had a friend, she was excellent at playing \u201cEternal Wars\u201d, but she is no longer with us.</p><br/><p>Yu Shengfan\u2019s pitiful, cancerous death has reaped open the path where countless of doujins started pairing up both Lin Feng and Yu Shengfan together. Right after Yu Shengfan gave her account and self-forged weapons to Lin Feng, not leaving out the ridiculous stats of that divine sword, Little Fish had since then earned the nickname of \u201cSword Sister\u201d, exactly the same with \u201cUmbrella brother[1]\u201d from another world</p><br/><p>Who knows, she would end up like a broken star, one fallen from the sky. They had once promised to stand at the summit of the kings, but now there was only one left to enjoy that glorious moment for the both of them. The dream of that person had slowly faded away \u2026</p><br/><p>Besides, talented readers had even co-written a song to grieve in her memory, and only lacked a melodic composition to go along with it.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, we would never believe that a fictional character\u2019s death would have such an impact on reality, and it even became a top search on Weibo, which was pretty evident that Yu Shengfan was a highly popular person.</p><br/><p>No one would ever forget this iconic character!</p><br/><p>Some of the readers shared their opinions, stating that Rosemary should not have led Little Fish to this miserable state in the first place. Instead, he should have just paralyzed Little Fish\u2019s hands, so she could no longer play any games, and that would be tragic enough. After all, she could end up becoming a professional commentator who utters abusive words, still, that had to be better than letting her die, right?</p><br/><p>Anyhow, a number of readers were totally against this idea, because this would only make Little Fish suffer even more! Have you forgotten about her tragic life experience, do you want to take away the only source of happiness for Little Fish, her refuge in her world of games?</p><br/><p>The readers from before had suddenly suggested that if Rosemary decides to paralyze her hands, he would never have set up such a tragic background, such as the passing of her mom and the hatred of her dad. Otherwise, there was no need for her to ever seek for that heartwarming sensation whenever she plays games \u2026</p><br/><p>Both sides of the argument did not come to a stop, and one side believed that she could forever live in Lin Feng\u2019s glorious moments even though she has passed away. It was a tragic notion, but one could still take comfort in forever being in another person\u2019s memory. The opposition thought that being alive was much better than being dead, even though she could no longer assist Lin Feng in the game.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was too lazy to even bother about the aftermath and reactions to this character\u2019s death, because it would be endless. It would be good for her if both sides continue arguing, as she would only be able to obtain more willpower.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, she did not even change her recommendation list. All she wanted to do was to attract as many readers as possible\u2026 so, let them complain!</p><br/><p>When Yu Shengfan\u2019s influential power begins to decline, she would consider cosplaying \u201cLittle Fish\u201d. She would use \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card\u201d to play games during live streams, and of course, she would never show her face, her lolita voice and that shocking venomous tongue, would definitely leave everyone dumbfounded</p><br/><p>Even though Little Fish had passed on in the Two Dimensional World, she has successfully broken through the fourth wall in a sense, and is now invading the three dimensional reality!</p><br/><p>How can you explain that ridiculous technique and that venomously talkative lolita voice? Deja vu much?</p><br/><p>All of Yu Shengfan\u2019s special traits would be found in this female streamer. No matter how you look at it, could it possibly be a coincidence, if she is not possessed by Little Fish?</p><br/><p>This wouldn\u2019t just be a coincidence, it would have to be a miracle too!</p><br/><p>As long as such a female streamer makes her appearance, she could temporarily utilize Little Fish\u2019s popularity to become extremely famous!</p><br/><p>Of course, as long as Zhao Youyue does not show her face, nobody will ever know that she is the one who caused all this fuss, right from the start!</p><br/><p>But then\u2026 she looked exactly like a side character, an ordinary high school female student\u2026</p><br/><p>In fact, the impressions that she gave to her homeroom teacher Mr. Qiu and all the other classmates who only knew her in passing was that of an obedient and well-disciplined \u201chonor student\u201d. Anyhow, this was the outcome of her sole dedication within a semester. She was extremely pleased with her accomplishment, while chances of her being forgiven by her teacher had increased exponentially.</p><br/><p>Anyway, if she is ever caught by Mr. Qiu again while playing with her phone, Mr. Qiu might hesitate to confiscate her phone. After all, she was this well-mannered and obedient student, with decent grades too, so he may let her off the hook for once?</p><br/><p>Of course, if she ever messes herself up in the coming exam, she would have to bear with the consequences!</p><br/><p>So he would just warn her without taking any action this time\u2026</p><br/><p>Obviously, these benefits were the reasons of Zhao Youyue wanting to become one of the \u201ctop students\u201d. Compared to her middle school life that did not carry that honorable \u201ctop student\u201d title, she now realized that her school life was much more entertaining and exciting.</p><br/><p>Now, Zhao Youyue was truly enjoying her high school life. Perhaps, she had always made it to the headlines through the literary realm, and had been through something that could not be experienced by a normal person, so she now appreciated her ordinary carefree school life even more.</p><br/><p>This is her method of maintaining her happy mood, or else she would not be able to bring out her full potential in the literary world, and that would be a pity.</p><br/><p>Tonight, she is all prepared to opening the gate to a new world once again, to see which novel or manga realm she enters next. She felt extremely confident, because she was already that famous in Qidian, as a super tycoon reader and a person who could spark a trend with her recommended book list. As such, which author would reject her request?</p><br/><p>Steady as she goes!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p>\n</div>"}

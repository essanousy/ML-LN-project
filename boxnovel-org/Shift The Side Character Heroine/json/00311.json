It might be my imagination, but I feel like there\u2019s a great deal of sadness lurking about this character, is this the rumored \u201cscent of death\u201d?</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how this author would react to the curse of Su Li; she might just lose her marbles and kill this main protagonist off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith artwork like that, I would usually go ahead and look into more of this character\u2019s novel of origin, but I\u2019m afraid of getting hurt. Let\u2019s wait for the others to read it first; their screams will tell us if she\u2019s going to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this character was based on Shirotsumekusa? I never expected Master Su Li to play \u2018Dreamside Maroon\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Su Li was once a leading force in the field of doujinshi. She once carried another pen-name who we shall not speak of. It\u2019s now a widely-known secret within the doujin circle. I\u2019ve seen many fanmade derivations of Shirotsumekusa, and this probably tops it all. She looks amazing! I\u2019m looking forward to reading this doujin novel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Su Li, would you be kind enough to reveal the other name of yours\u2026 Hehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Besides the minority of the fans who truly praised the beauty of this illustration, most of the netizens were ridiculing the female character \u201cAltair.\u201d What sort of unfortunate fate awaited her, and how much longer would she live?</p><br/><p>Undeniably, Su Li really did a good job of drawing this illustration amazingly, it had piqued the interest of many others, even though \u201cDreamside Maroon\u201d was relatively unknown.</p><br/><p>Many were aware of Qidian\u2019s fanwork section, which mostly consisted of doujin animations, novels, and other creations. Some doujins were so well written, that one would not even need to visit the source material to enjoy them in their entirety.</p><br/><p>When everyone realized that this doujin was in the official game\u2019s forum which required a working ID to access, many were too lazy to go through the process and gave up on it.</p><br/><p>The platform which one picks to post his or her content played a huge role. In Qidian\u2019s case, whenever a new literary work gets posted, every major pirated website would follow up without a moment\u2019s delay, to the point that people could easily be duped into thinking that these pirated websites were created by Qidian officials.</p><br/><p>If \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d doujin novel was posted on Qidian, it would be impossible for it to have zero popularity and subscription.</p><br/><p>After Su Li read through the comments and criticisms, she smirked. She boldly replied, \u201cYou guys have no idea what you\u2019re talking about! Saying that misfortune would befall upon \u2018Altair\u2019 without even reading the novel, is just unheard of! This female protagonist is insanely powerful; even she isn\u2019t aware of the boundaries of her own powers, how could such a mysterious, broken character succumb to misfortune?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Su Li did not understand the novel, \u201cWhite Clover,\u201d but in the process of putting ink to paper, she learned more and more about \u201cAltair.\u201d She has done nothing more than cross over dimensions while surveying in silence, but deep within her, something lay in wait. Something terrifying!</p><br/><p>This military uniform princess, Altair, was nothing unlike a boss. And final bosses don\u2019t just drop dead. She was the sole character of this doujin novel, if she ever dies, how else would this novel continue?</p><br/><p>So Su Li was quite confident that history would never repeat itself here, it could not! Everything that happened in the past was all just a coincidence! Lightning does not strike the same place twice, or in her case, four times \u2013 Xu Jing, Yu Shengfan, and Chu Luoxun all died after she introduced them to ink that was because they were mere mortals. But not Altair, she may carry the guise of a mortal, but she was mystery incarnate. She also seemed to be happy as she was at that moment, taking her own life would be inconceivable!</p><br/><p>After Su Li thought about it at length, she could not see any way that this could go wrong. All this while, the fault was not hers. Lady Zhao was the one who had the tendency of falling in love with ill-fated females. Su Li only drew those characters because Lady Zhao was into them.</p><br/><p>This time, nobody could possibly accuse her of anything!</p><br/><p>The next person who calls her \u201cPan of this generation\u201d again would only be subjecting themselves to her wrath!</p><br/><p>Su Li lay back, and let herself go. To her, the deed had already been done. This illustration had already cleared her name. Many saw her reply, but not as many believed her, especially those of the meme-loving variety. Of course, some firmly believed that Su Li would not mess things up, this time, or else nobody would ever dare commission her to illustrate a single thing, again. She had the power to draw everything to death, how terrifying was that!</p><br/><p>Su Li had done her part in promoting the doujin novel, \u201cWhite Clover,\u201d but the effects were lackluster, due to the quality of the original content.</p><br/><p>The novel\u2019s thread started flooding up, but most of the comments went along the lines of, \u201cCan\u2019t understand,\u201d \u201cWriting is terrible,\u201d and \u201cMakes no sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only those who had nothing better to do, would have the patience to read this novel, but the best verdict they could give was, \u201cUnique.\u201d The problem therein was that its uniqueness knew no bounds, and no average person would comprehend its contents.</p><br/><p>This literary work only existed to please its creator. This was the ultimate form of self-gratification, nobody would be able to share its creator\u2019s joy.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue was an exception, but even she too found the writing horrendously dull, only being able to enjoy it when she traveled within its worlds, in person.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d too note of those comments, but she only smiled and moved on. She was already used to such comments; she was never popular, to begin with.</p><br/><p>A month later, \u201cWhite Clover\u201d came out as a doujin anime video. \u201cAltair: Divina Commedia\u201d went viral on Bilibili!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue provided the music of this video; which was no longer than ten minutes. Unsurprisingly, her music was all grand and exciting. The beautiful, fantasy worlds visualized in this video attracted a great deal of attention!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will herald the coming of change unto this world, exacting punishment upon the domain of the Gods[1],\u201d Altair had uttered in this doujin video.</p><br/><p>Instantly, \u201cSetsuna\u201d the doujin creator attained fame!</p><br/><p>Then, she passed away due to sickness.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetsuna\u201d held on to her phone as she passed away, and before her final breath, she uploaded her final chapter to the internet.</p><br/><p>She left the world in peace. Naturally, her passing meant that \u201cWhite Clover\u201d would remain incomplete, but not before throwing in a subtle hint on the hidden ability of Altair</p><br/><p>Holopsicon[2]!</p><br/><p>Altair would constantly gain new abilities whenever someone writes a fanfiction about her, and whatever abilities that are associated with that story would be added to her plethora of powers. As long as her stories continue, she would gain more abilities infinitely. Since Altair had no story of her own, any new abilities would be granted by other authors; it was called \u201cHolopsicon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only one author had written about \u201cAltair\u201d in her novel, but the video went viral, and inspired many other doujin creators to write more stories about this military uniform princess!</p><br/><p>The original \u201cWhite Clover\u201d never got to reveal anything else, so nobody got to know the true power of Altair\u2019s Holopsicon ability.</p><br/><p>In the final chapter of \u201cWhite Clover,\u201d before \u201cSetsuna\u201d passed away, she wrote</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce again, Altair stepped into a new world; only to realize that she was just a fictional character\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, on the other hand, did not know that \u201cSetsuna\u201d had passed away, due to her illness. She was going to invite her out on a celebration because of the success of her doujin video.</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>1. We will herald the coming of change unto this world, exacting punishment upon the domain of the Gods (. ) The original English subs in the anime failed to fully translate the Princess\u2019 character-defining statement of \u201cwarewa ga sekai ni henkaku, kamigami no chi wo seisai wo.\u201d Amazon had translated this as: \u201cRevolution to your world, punishment to the land of the gods.\u201d This leaves out the dual meaning of seisai, which can be written as (sanction) or (holy festival). A more accurate translation would thus be \u201cWe will transform this world, exacting punishment upon the land of the gods.\u201dThe Chinese lines written by the author in this novel had been far more accurate, just in case any of you start wondering why we have translated them differently from the Amazon subs.</p><br/><p>2. Holopsicon \u2013 Described by Altair as omnipotent, giving her a vast array of abilities. (Taken from Re: Creators Wikia.)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even if she tried, she would not find anything pleasing about Yuan Shawu.</p><br/><p>In terms of appearances, there was no doubt about it. Yuan Shawu was a born beauty. But she did not know the first thing about dressing up, or cosmetics. How could she compare herself to Qiu Yuting, who had gone through campus hell?</p><br/><p>University girls might have not have seen much of the world, but they absolutely knew how to dress up. For Qiu Yuting, the common practice would be to master that path\u2026</p><br/><p>It was impossible for them to study. Study? Study my a**!</p><br/><p>As long as they did not fail anything and dawdled for a graduation certificate, a diploma or bachelor degree certificate, wasn\u2019t this relaxing?</p><br/><p>Comparing Yuan Shawu and Qiu Yuting would not be too much of a stretch. But when it came to other aspects, they were miles apart!</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting was versatile. Even if she was unable to become popular in the entertainment industry, she was certainly way better than ordinary folk!</p><br/><p>Did Yuan Shawu have any talents to speak of?</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting only felt like laughing. If being addicted to the 2D world was also considered a talent, suit yourself.</p><br/><p>There was also that matter of daily self-care. Within Qiu Yuting\u2019s reincarnated memories, Yuan Shawu was a good-for-nothing who always needed her elder brother\u2019s care, while causing all sorts of trouble to others. She\u2019s a waste of oxygen!</p><br/><p>However, Qiu Yuting knew very well about how much Yuan Zhengzong cared for his younger sister. Therefore, as a member of society and a person with a matured soul in her young body, she would absolutely not display any of her dislike towards Yuan Shawu. Instead, she intended to prove to Yuan Zhengzong through actual actions that she could take care of his younger sister, together with him. What a bonus!</p><br/><p>As long as she received Yuan Shawu\u2019s recognition, would she not be an item with Yuan Zhengzong?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t ask her why she believed that this would work. She was a reincarnated. Before her awakening, she had taken great care into examining each and every possible threat. Now that destiny had thrown her a bone, she could place all her possible love rivals in a list.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she would not pursue a true love like a fool. Career-wise, she could easily walk the road of others, leaving them no way to go!</p><br/><p>The other world lines had many iconic songs to offer. The songs were not yet produced, as of yet. Therefore, these songs certainly belonged to her!</p><br/><p>She was not worried about being called out. No one would ever find any evidence to pin her. Not unless someone knew that she was a reincarnated and had been plagiarizing without scruple, just because no one else could see the future!</p><br/><p>A reincarnated would be free to carry out her will, staying ahead of the curve in every field. It was wholly impossible to search for evidence to prove that she was a plagiarist. She could brag on shamelessly, claiming herself to be a genius!</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting was undoubtedly the plagiarist reincarnated. Her plagiarized works mostly came from the future.</p><br/><p>A plagiarist would not last long, as one could finish plagiarizing all the works one day. Therefore, for many Isekai novels, their protagonist\u2019s first pot of gold would be plagiarism, and then they would begin cutting into business\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Qiu Yuting obviously did not have such a mindset. Since this was a cultural entertainment kind of source world, she chose to walk the cultural entertainment path. It was also considered her previous dream to become a superstar singer. Now, she still had dreams. She had to claim those future iconic songs as her own!</p><br/><p>These days, many protagonists had devolved into plagiarists. But there were indeed not many who were as self-righteous, or as shameless as Qiu Yuting. To write cultural entertainment works these days, one needed to be able to adapt. They would brag about how far superior the protagonist\u2019s twist of things would be, compared to the original piece. Or, they would localize Hollywood blockbusters. It was enough for them to brag in peace\u2026</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting probably thought that she was the only reincarnated walking about. That was why she was so brash, so audacious. So, what if there was another reincarnated?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had claimed Yuan Shawu as her own. This could also be considered a form of rebirth. To be precise, she was also capable of viewing other world lines. Of course, this meant that she could easily see Qiu Yuting\u2019s movements from a mile away!</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting invited Yuan Zhengzong for lunch. She naturally hoped that Yuan Zhengzong would invite her for the next meal. Not to dine outside, but to dine at Yuan Zhengzong\u2019s house\u2026</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong was too kind for his own good. He trusted others far too easily. This beautiful senior, female reader understood him so well. There was no awkwardness, it was as if they had known each other since their past life. Of course, he unhesitantly agreed to it.</p><br/><p>Anyway, he was going to cook dinner for his younger sister \u2014 it would not take much work preparing another set for Qiu Yuting.</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong had been wanting to learn how she figured out his unknown identity as a light novelist. Who knows, she might just be making a fool out of him\u2026</p><br/><p>But Yuan Zhengzong was happy to find her answering questions about his novel fluently. Did this not prove that she was indeed a loyal reader?</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong brought Qiu Yuting to the door of his house. That was when his senses came back online. This was his first day knowing this beautiful senior, and he was already bringing her back home. Wasn\u2019t this a little too soon?</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong functioned this way. Onlookers would want to beat him up!</p><br/><p>While scratching his head, he said sheepishly, \u201cI should have been back home to tidy the house up. It\u2019s going to be in a mess. How forgetful of me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting quickly waved him off, \u201cYou\u2019ve done way enough. Even if your house is in a mess, it\u2019s not because of you, but that younger sister of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Zhengzong had not mentioned his younger sister much to Qiu Yuting. Even if he did, he would never tell her how much of an otaku and good-for-nothing his younger sister was. He would only brag about how lovely, cute, and obedient his younger sister was. Well, it was actually him who was subservient to her.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Yuan Zhengzong could not help but curiously ask about how she knew of his younger sister\u2019s sluggish behavior\u2026</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting quickly attempted to scoop the beans back into the sack. It worked. Yuan Zhengzong was way too gullible, even a child could deceive him!</p><br/><p>As Yuan Zhengzong remained lost in thought, he finally took his house keys out and opened the door\u2026</p><br/><p>He immediately closed the door. Was he at the wrong house? He rubbed his eyes slightly, and opened the door again\u2026</p><br/><p>He stood in the doorway, dumbfounded. Why was the floor sparkling? It was too clean, squeaky clean!</p><br/><p>Qiu Yuting was even more shocked about it\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Besides, you specially presented \u201cXu Jing\u201d with a ponytail hairstyle. Perhaps you have considered this hairstyle to be quite common and unattractive, but out of your expectation, it had made her stand out from all the other characters. She seemed to be the only girl with a ponytail since the manga release.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this compliment from her assistant, she humbled herself, \u201cHonestly, I feel my drawing skill is still unrefined. It\u2019s just that drawing this kind of female characters has always been my specialty and style. Well, I was about to draw merely a side character, without knowing it, I had drawn another pretty girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, there is one thing that has to be mentioned. The manga characters are facing severe homogeneity in term of their appearances. At times, they are only distinguishable by their hairstyles and hair colors. These situations happen among male protagonists of Harem mangas especially, since all of them have always looked like the same person, or you might say the other guy with \u201cKirito\u2019s face\u201d [1]. As the name implies, it is not surprising that many male characters look like Kirito!</p><br/><p>Su Li then continued, \u201cI\u2019ve to agree with your viewpoint on the matter of hairstyle. I personally prefer \u201cblack, long and silky hair\u201d, \u201cdouble ponytails\u201d, \u201cside ponytail\u201d, \u201cbobbed hair\u201d and so on\u2026 Even if it\u2019s the iconic ponytail, the length must be the same as the hips. This character\u2019s hairstyle, is the most common one you can find in reality. In any way, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s attractive at all, so I\u2019ve simply opted for it. This is unbelievable, it actually rendered her outstanding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere must be some other factors which have intrigued you. What are they?\u201d Su Li inquired.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ziqiang had pulled no punches. As Su Li\u2019s assistant, he reckoned that not only should he support her on the artworks, but he shall contribute on the creative ideas as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Of course\u2026 it\u2019s the personality and behaviour of this character.\u201d Zhang Ziqiang spoke in a leisure manner.</p><br/><p>Su Li then showed an expression of the \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d. Zhang Ziqiang was indeed a slow speaker, while Su Li herself was a pepperbox. Just before Ziqiang managed to finish his sentence, she could not resist countering, \u201cWhat kind of personality does she have? Not to mention her behaviour\u2026 I\u2019ve never spent any meticulous effort in depicting her, have I? She barely have a few lines in the story, and is nothing more than a background character!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Ziqiang was not in a hurry to retort her, and again, he spoke firmly, \u201cFor the personality of this character\u2026 perhaps you didn\u2019t keep your own character setting in mind, but I did notice it\u2026 This girl might not show a great aptitude, but\u2026 she is quite diligent, aspirant and so passionate in her studies\u2026 Am I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li nodded her head without qualms, \u201cThat\u2019s right, she\u2019s just a side character, and shall not possess any aptitude, or else it must be my mistake! You know, within the main character\u2019s harem, there\u2019s such princess character with an IQ as high as 250, blonde hair, flat chest, and a Tsundere[2] personality. It\u2019s impossible that I would create another character with such superior IQ, that will just be repetitive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAptitude is not a big thing. What\u2019s most admirable about her is her diligence and passion for studies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, I don\u2019t understand what you are saying. A regular character setting like this, yet being placed upon an unappealing side character, how interesting could that be? I think you\u2019re delusional! Xu Jing was given this character setting solely to serve as the icing on a cake for Yang Xixi, the most important \u201clittle-sister character\u201d in my manga. As an old saying goes, \u201cOne who touches rouge will be stained with red, one who touches ink will be stained with black\u201d [3]. I\u2019ve thus presented Yang Xixi with this bestie, who is mundane but full of positive energy, and this will be a plus for Yang Xixi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Li had set forth her intentions behind the character setting of \u201cXu Jing\u201d, but little did she know, that it had already been altered. She was positive that all of this stemmed from her sole ideas.</p><br/><p>From that, one could easily discern the brilliance of Zhao Youyue who had secretly sabotaged things. If she was to act like it is the first time she entered the Two Dimensional Gate, granting an invincible superpower to the character she played, still, her changes to the manga would take effect in the reality. However, once the author felt peculiar about it, they would think that either they were drunk or a head cramp came bumping in. If not, how could they possibly cook up those plots which are obviously not in sync with the previous story! Soon after that, they shall fix the story altogether!</p><br/><p>But now, Su Li had faith that the entire thing was her initial setting!</p><br/><p>Su Li had put up a lot of effort and attention in depicting the \u201clittle-sister character\u201d, Yang Xixi. Besides having two cute little sisters of her own in real life, she is essentially a fan of little girls. What is more, this little sister is incredibly popular as for now, especially among the male readers. Of course, she would be partial to the little sister, whereas for the other harem characters, she did not even bother to mention whether they have any bestie.</p><br/><p>In a sense, Su Li was right. A side character such as \u201cXu Jing\u201d, relies heavily on the little sister for her existence. Well, if it was not for the high popularity of the little sister, there would not be anything much of her.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhang Ziqiang heaved a sigh. He was not going to debate any further with Su Li. Sure enough, she was a lady who knows her own thoughts, not to mention, her previous achievements had built up the pride within her bone. For the sake of \u201cXu Jing\u201d however, he could not help but to retort, \u201cMaybe this is not a plus, but a minus instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Su Li was running out of patience. She had even concluded that, Zhang Ziqiang is destined to not getting anywhere in the manga field, as he failed to even acknowledge the key points. To think that he would be fascinated by just a side character\u2026 hmm\u2026</p><br/><p>Instead of speaking leisurely like always, Zhang Ziqiang reeled off, \u201cIndeed, this \u201cXu Jing\u201d had always been a background character in the manga, but she was always studying! When Yang Xixi was getting in heat while fantasizing her beloved boy, Xu Jing was studying. Remember the times when Yang Xixi was involved in a catfight with the other harem girls, in front the male protagonist, and eventually caught in a deathmatch? Xu Jing was still studying, quietly at one corner! Even though she was only a background character, I had always believed, that such a setting by Master Su Li must have its underlying meaning, but it seems that I had over-thought myself way too much. How disappointing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Su Li was puzzled at the rapid speech of Zhang Ziqiang, but he was not finished yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a school Harem manga, in which most of the characters are students. They are either the male protagonists, or the bunch of girls surrounding him, which of course includes \u201cYang Xixi\u201d, the little sister whose character design has satisfied you the most. As students, however, these people had never been well-behaved, they knew nothing more than bickering, hopping around, and scratching each other. In contrast, \u201cXu Jing\u201d is constantly studying in silence at the corner, yet she carries an innocent and genuine character. Xu Jing, is definitely different from those bitches within the main character\u2019s harem! That\u2019s how this character captivated my interest\u2026 It\u2019s still okay if the readers haven\u2019t noticed her, and if they do, for sure they will diminish all the plain Jane-s of no distinctive traits. Moreover, they are so enthused in looking out for guys, well, that\u2019s pretty cheap by the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening all of this, Su Li was deeply shocked, and her mind went into a turmoil\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Kirito is a fictional character in \u201cSword Art Online\u201d, a Japanese light novel series.

Forget about her annoying chat bubbles, just by looking at her spectacular gaming skills, it could be described in one word \u2013 Art. Everyone was absorbed in the ultimate reflexes and all sort of extreme techniques that she had displayed. Once she performed a technique successfully, the audience would give a standing ovation and compliments as such:</p><br/><p>Wow, there is such a technique?</p><br/><p>This technique is breathtaking!</p><br/><p>Plus, \u201cEternal War\u201d was inherently noted for its magnificent battle scenes, thus watching the PK match of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d was comparable to watching a match of Kungfu. It was a visual splendor indeed!</p><br/><p>The opponents of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d surely felt aggrieved and irritated when PK-ing her. Having been strangled by her in term of gaming skills, yet they had to suffer seeing all sort of her chat bubbles filled with sarcasm. Unfortunately, there was yet to have such option to mute the opponent in \u201cEternal War\u201d.</p><br/><p>Never had the game official anticipated someone who was able to PK and type insulting messages at the same time. Note that the operation of \u201cEternal War\u201d was quite complicated and meticulous. In the eyes of pro gamers, if a minor mistake in the game was caught by the enemy, one might suffer a devastating combo attack, then falling to pieces\u2026</p><br/><p>However, neither had caught any mistake of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d. Many players in new server could do nothing but to cry in jealousy, \u201cThe real experts had never visited this new server, so this \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d is able to act as a king here. If she tries fighting in the Arena of all servers in \u2018Eternal War\u2019, she gonna be taught a lesson for sure!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d was taunting \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d via chat bubble. At the sight of this, the audience was overwhelmed with excitement at once and delivered their supports to \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d in public chat one after another:</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the best Hoodlum Master! Beat the ladyboy lying fatty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, a beautiful swordmistress character being played by a fat otaku, what a waste!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the betting started? I\u2019ll bet on Hoodlum Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, I\u2019m supporting Hoodlum Master too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you put your bet on Unpleasant Rain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOops\u2026 probably my hand had slipped\u2026 Hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, some players had retorted that \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d was nothing better. If \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d was considered as an Arena overlord who paid no heed to dungeons and boss fights, this \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d could be seen as a devious and deplorable gamer who intruded into every single boss fight, and pursued his goal by fair means or foul.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoodlum Master\u201d had even bragged that despite his rouge character in game, he was an honest man in reality, an extremely helpful citizen who would help an old granny to cross the road, yet a husband who would forgive his wife though he is cuckolded. Hence, to counterbalance this reality, he had no choice but to display the other side of him in game, which was the only place he could make troubles. He snatched the others\u2019 monsters not for experience or items, but solely to relish the hoodlum moment.</p><br/><p>Tang YongKai happened to know Lin Feng when he was messing around, and eventually bowed to the skills and magnanimity of Lin Feng. After all, he was such a dirty-mouth in game, and rarely could anyone tolerate his words or behaviours, as every human has their level of tolerance, even in-game. Nevertheless, he managed to find this game, a lawless world in which he could act as a hoodlum without scruples. Ahh, what an eccentric man\u2026</p><br/><p>That being said, Lin Feng could put up with him. Perhaps he had to look up to his talents, and thus overlooked all sort of his insolences and provocations. To him, no matter what a person has done in game, if it is not something harmful to reality like money or sex swindle, it is all acceptable. Do whatever as you please, that is the meaning of game!</p><br/><p>Just like those sandbox games, in which the controlled character could even put forth a massacre just to rob equipment, is that considered morally wrong?</p><br/><p>Having accepted Tang Yongkai, Lin Feng naturally was able to accept \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d too. Though she liked to spam chat bubbles during PK, she might be a true ladyboy otaku, but does that matter? As long as she excelled in gaming! When \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d saw the chat bubble sent by her opponent, a chirpy smile with cute canine teeth had shown on her elegant face. She really liked someone talking to her, whether it be good words or bad words. Perhaps this is the maximum level of loneliness.</p><br/><p>With her typing speed that was beyond a regular human, she countered, \u201cI\u2019m always good-tempered, as I\u2019ve never scolded a human. But I\u2019m gonna do it now as I still consider you as one. After all, even the Amoeba protozoa on any keyboard touched by you would die on the spot. So I know, you definitely don\u2019t have a girlfriend, as you might only find one in the zoo, or even other planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the chat bubble above \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, Tang Yongkai\u2019s hand which was holding a mouse had gotten some bulging veins. That was a cold hard truth, he had no girlfriend! Perhaps this is the fate of an honest man? Anyway, it was now obvious why he dared claim himself as a husband who would forgive his wife though he is cuckolded. Because he got to have a wife in the first place\u2026</p><br/><p>Nowadays, the cuckold society was quite a trend on Weibo, not that the members liked to be cuckolded, in fact they had no chance to be, and so they could crow over the cuckold stories online. Should it happen on them someday, let\u2019s see whether they could laugh so happily.</p><br/><p>Lin Feng who had remained tranquil at the side chuckled. He felt this \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d was indeed a heart-piercer. The exhilaration of public chat continued to increase, until one comment appeared \u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys laughing at? It\u2019s alright for those who have a girlfriend, but for those who don\u2019t, aren\u2019t you just laughing at\u2026 yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once this comment came to sight, the public chat went into a dead silence, as if a gloomy atmosphere had permeated the air. After a while, it was spammed with the comments \u201cEsports player doesn\u2019t need a girlfriend!\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>The smile had disappeared from Lin Feng\u2019s face, as he had no girlfriend as well.</p><br/><p>Nevermind, he still had his brothers.</p><br/><p>Infuriated, \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d utterly lost his mind and charged forward. A high quality PK match began. In the earlier story of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, Tang Yongkai was depicted as a prodigy gamer who had impressed even Lin Fang.</p><br/><p>However, in the face of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d failed to cut the mustard!</p><br/><p>Lin Feng who was standing aside finally regained some expressions on his face. The skills possessed by this \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d was way too astonishing! What a decent reflex!</p><br/><p>\u201cHoodlum Master\u201d had not even triggered \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d to manifest her true power!</p><br/><p>The reason was simple!</p><br/><p>The chat bubbles of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d continued to appear rhythmically above her head. The sarcastic words were even more heart-piercing now. Tang Yongkai who was beside Lin Feng had lost his nerve, sweating\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] In Chinese, PK means:</p><br/><p>\u2013 A solo battle between two players. \u201ca PK expert\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Challenge. \u201cHe is going to PK his rival\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

After all, uncertain possibilities were rather vague in real life.</p><br/><p>But in the manga world, there was never such a thing known as accidents, or you could say it in a way that even if accidents do happen, those were merely the creator\u2019s arrangements. As for now, Zhao Youyue had taken control of the manga\u2019s flow and everything would proceed perfectly according to Xu Jing\u2019s script, after all the mangaka had to inherit Xu Jing\u2019s will. Besides, Su Li was not able to change the manga\u2019s direction anymore and these were indeed the consequences of using Xu Jing to make \u201cPure Romance\u201d popular.</p><br/><p>The worst part was that Su Li had never thought of anything wrong for her to portray the story. Instead, she felt that she was in her top form in terms of drawing skills. In fact, she had a creative mind to create different stories that were totally unpredictable. Without doubt, readers would be in a dumbfounded situation while reading \u201cPure Romance\u201d.</p><br/><p>Where was the herbivorous boy protagonist who was supposed to be a soft and polite guy?</p><br/><p>Where was the harmonious Harem?</p><br/><p>Where was the unity as per promised?</p><br/><p>Why did the herbivorous boy have sex with all the female heroines except his sister without taking any responsibilities?</p><br/><p>Why did the harmonious Harem turn into such a chaos up to the point where several delicate female heroines quietly left the male protagonist? All of these sufferings have inflicted the characters\u2019 stakeholders to be in despair. Why did it turn into this kind of situation? How could you be so mundane at this? It should\u2019ve been me\u2026</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026 Regarding the happy ending, he he he he he he he\u2026</p><br/><p>Indeed, \u201cPure Romance\u201d had yet to enter its final ending. Meanwhile, Xu Jing was not an expectation of the readers by falling in love with the male protagonist, instead, she gave all her love to Yang Xixi. Surprisingly, it had brought out the \u201ccute\u201d nature in them which was totally out of the reader\u2019s expectations. Still, readers did express their thoughts that this storyline was not bad at all, in which it had no clich\u00e9 elements, and could still retain Xu Jing\u2019s independence. Her unconditional love and caring towards Yang Xixi successfully attracted tons of female readers to indulge themselves within the story. They even agreed that it would be wonderful to have such a bestie as they were more than willing to have a best friend in accordance to their goddess, Xu Jing.</p><br/><p>Many of the manga experts were amazed by Su Li who crowned herself with her very own manga. She created Xu Jing at the latter part of the manga in which this character was gratified with high popularity. As a matter of fact, Su Li was highly dependent on this female character which attracted tons of female readers and thus \u201cPure Romance\u201d rapidly became the most favourite Harem manga among female readers. Master Su Li was truly on her right move!</p><br/><p>Anyway, \u201cPure Romance\u201d was confirmed to be produced into an animation and as such, Su Li was being put into a demonized state, thinking that she would soon be greater than God. She had always maintained in this condition (which was actually dominated by the darkened Xu Jing\u2019s) in order to create new works!</p><br/><p>The story continued, where the soft and passive Yang Ming was seduced by his childhood friend Li Xiaotong. Apart from kissing to caressing her whole body, Li Xiaotong also took the initiative to give Yang Ming a blowjob with her hand and mouth. The temptation and orgasm experienced by Yang Ming made him fired up and released his seal, allowing his brain to command the rest of his body. When other girls were beside him, he was no longer the herbivorous boy he used to be and would make a move towards the girls. As for those girls, they seemed pretty happy with Yang Ming and found him irresistible.</p><br/><p>They thought that Yang Ming finally opened up his mind and made his right choice. Who knew that the previous Yang Ming had treated every girl in the same way. He was the type of guy who was rather serious at all times and would not be easily triggered by sexual desire. But now, as long as the girls did not refuse his request, he would ask for more all because he found high gratification and the pleasure in it\u2026 Doesn\u2019t he sound like a scum? In fact, he was just showing his true desire.</p><br/><p>In this process, as a mangaka herself, Su Li demonstrated her drawing skills on the book by utilizing and inserting all her skills into \u201cPure Romance\u201d. As a result, \u201cPure Romance\u201d would never show any of a women\u2019s private parts, in other words you would not come across any private parts being described in the novel. However, it could be pretty intriguing for the readers up to the point where guys\u2019 penises would definitely erect while girls would feel so shy yet getting themselves addicted to the story. No other reasons stated but simply because it was well illustrated!</p><br/><p>However, you might not believe that the sex scenes between Yang Ming and the plain jane-s were not the best part yet.</p><br/><p>Of course, the best part still belonged to the character Xu Jing!</p><br/><p>On this day, Yang Ming finally brought his childhood friend Li Xiaotong home and realized that Yang Xixi, his sister was nowhere to be seen. She seemed to have gone out with her bestie Xu Jing and felt that lady luck was right by his side. Without wasting any time, he pushed Li Xiaotong down and started their \u201cwar\u201d in the living room. How splendid could this be?</p><br/><p>On the opposite side, it was the worst day for Yang Xixi. Initially \u201cXu Jing\u201d was craving for some snacks, hence she was so ecstatic to bring the \u201cXu Jing\u201d in her to head out and buy some. They actually bought a lot. Through Yang Xixi\u2019s perspective, her best friend \u201cXu Jing\u201d finally learnt her lesson and started enjoying life instead of having a daily routine similar to the life of a reading robot.</p><br/><p>However, when both of them returned to Xixi\u2019s house, upon opening the door, they witnessed a scene that could never be accepted. Yang Xixi\u2019s beloved brother was pumping hard on a girl who had always took great care of Yang Xixi and meanwhile both of them were lying on the dining table performing indescribable acts. This savaged couple who were so engrossed in their sexual activity, happened to be in the midst of heaven up to the point that both of them were unaware of the opened door.</p><br/><p>If this shocking scene ever appeared in any anime version, the pop-up screen would naturally turn green in color.</p><br/><p>However, the awkward scene was still fresh. Yang Xixi who loved her brother so much suddenly lost the courage to step into her own house to reprimand the couple who were still in the process, instead she ran out in tears.</p><br/><p>Xu Jing immediately chased after her. She was pretty happy about it in her heart, as Yang Xixi should be entirely disappointed by Yang Ming right?</p><br/><p>But how could this be?</p><br/><p>Of course, she would choose to forgive him!</p><br/><p>But at night, Yang Xixi did not want to return home. Instead, both of them went to a motel because that was the only place they could afford a stay with their money and without doubt, the room provided had only a single bed.</p><br/><p>When the both of them had finish their bath, they wanted to get in bed together. Xu Jing who was usually expressionless and calm, had a blushed face and a surge of heart rate. How obvious and impactful she showed the difference in her!</p><br/><p>Yang Xixi rolled her body over, with her reddened eyes, gazing into the eyes of Xu Jing and asked her a question with an extremely low volume, \u201cXu Jing, what kind of person do you like? I\u2019m kind of interested to know\u2026 Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Jing only looked at the lips of Yang Xixi, where her brain started to flash countless scenes of her staying together with Yang Xixi. With a blushed face, she gently held on Yang Xixi\u2019s cheek and kissed it.</p><br/><p>When Su Li was drawing such a beautiful content, the office was playing a Japanese song named \u201cNightCore Heikousen\u201d \u2014-</p><br/><p>\u3092\u3051\u3057\u3066,\u3067\u308f\u308b\u3046.[Together we escape from the Solar System, and will reunite on its\u2019 parallel lines]</p><br/><p>\u3068\u306e\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3073\u3066\u3044\u308b.[Just like the shadows of me and you extending under the sun]</p><br/><p>\u3042\u3041,.[Ah ah, the parallel lines]</p>\n</div>"}

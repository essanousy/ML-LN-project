An average Jane would never click with her eccentricity\u2026</p><br/><p>But Zhao Youyue was no average Jane, distinctive and eccentric personalities attracted her the most and that was exactly what Bai Yunshan was. Awkwardly honorable and dutiful. She was just like a pure, little white flower, waiting to be plucked.</p><br/><p>But this flower was covered with thorns, and turned away many. It did not have the beauty to force people through those thorns. Otherwise, some men would have tortured themselves as they forced their way through the thorns, only for things to end up miserably\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan would nitpick their flaws with her cold expression and crush their confidence. She had high standards. Of course, she had a high standard for herself, and that gave her the right to nitpick others.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was the only exception. She was far superior Bai Yunshan, be it her academic results, musical talents, and athletism! She even had a good reputation and great popularity\u2026</p><br/><p>For this Bai Yunshan felt shame for herself and admiration for the other lady on equal measure.</p><br/><p>Not only that, Zhao Youyue was beautiful and elegant, and came from a formidable family. Whenever she approached someone, she would never seek for any returns. Bai Yunshan could never bring herself to hate Zhao Youyue, in spite of all her oddities. She was an oddball, but she was a harmless oddball, unless people insisted on getting involved\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, there were some weirdos like Han Leng. He truly cared about Zhao Youyue, yet he always seemed to avoid her. He would drag himself to write a love letter on the behalf of others and deliver them to Zhao Youyue to satisfy his own love.</p><br/><p>Han Leng knew how popular Zhao Youyue was on the internet, but he never actually expected the super famous live streamer Ah Yu to be Zhao Youyue! Ah Yu\u2019s songs were his favorite songs to listen to, especially the original songs that Ah Yu had composed specifically for Chu Luoxun!</p><br/><p>He had heard those melodies in his mind as he wrote, and it gave him the confidence to think that he could have a good chat with Ah Yu about music, if they ever met up. Even though he did not know much about music, but he was capable of writing lyrics.</p><br/><p>Evidently, Ah Yu was better at writing song lyrics. Her lyrics had not been present in his novel, and they often left him in shame\u2026</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, Han Leng knew that Ah Yu was a loyal fan of his novel, \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d Why else would she compose songs for \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d if she was not one?</p><br/><p>If not for her song lyrics like \u201cSweet,\u201d \u201cAngel\u2019s Wing,\u201d \u201cHappened to meet you,\u201d and \u201cI left sadness for myself,\u201d the character, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d would not have left such an impact on the audience. Most importantly, she never once monetized these original songs, just like the Chu Luoxun in the novel. She simply wanted to share her music with more people and bring more happiness to the world.</p><br/><p>These songs went viral on the internet then \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d and \u201cBeautiful April\u201d became really popular, and Han Leng gained worldwide acclaim.</p><br/><p>Han Leng had been really grateful to the live streamer, Ah Yu. Unfortunately, he did not have the time to watch her live streaming videos, so he would never be able to hand her gifts. He knew she was a mysterious person and never made any headlines. It did not bother him, as he was only there to listen to her music.</p><br/><p>It was already more than enough for a young scholar like Han Leng. It was his ideal romantic experience for him. The video about Zhao Youyue on her violin during the new year\u2019s eve party was probably his daily viewing, while the music he listened the most to was Ah Yu\u2019s. He tried to compare these two people, only to make himself more confused\u2026</p><br/><p>He thought that if Chu Luoxun really existed in this dimension, her musical talents would have been possessed by these two girls.</p><br/><p>He could never forget how the musical world took him in. At first he had been thoroughly convinced that his embellished writing would never be replicated in the real world, only to realize that it had been the opposite\u2026</p><br/><p>Ever since witnessing Zhao Youyue\u2019s outstanding performance, Han Leng truly believed that novels needed to be logical and rational! Reality would not need it, because everyone would have to accept it, no matter the case.</p><br/><p>During a weekend afternoon, Han Leng was scrolling his phone in his dorm, only to come upon a most startling revelation</p><br/><p>That super famous live streamer was Zhao Youyue all along, that same popular Zhao Youyue on the internet and the campus belle of their school\u2026</p><br/><p>The songs that he loved so much, were all written by Zhao Youyue as well?</p><br/><p>Why does Zhao Youyue keep on appearing in his world!?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Zhao Youyue mention that she was a fan of Lin Meiyue? Why would she put out so much effort composing songs for Chu Luoxun, was her Meiyue fangirl ship a farce?</p><br/><p>When Han Leng was reminded of how Zhao Youyue was a fan of Lin Meiyue, he felt the slightest of hostility towards her, convinced that Zhao Youyue did not truly understand the meaning behind his literary work\u2026</p><br/><p>Han Leng was certain that Zhao Youyue was not riding upon the fame of that character. She only did this because she liked his work, and admired the character that he had created. Even so, he often found himself thinking that perhaps, Lady Zhao had a crush on him. She was always helping him out, without asking for any favors in return.</p><br/><p>No other girl treated him this well in his entire life, though he never actually felt any love from her. Her existence gave his life meaning. As the author of \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d he also became highly popular in school.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, Leng Zi turned out to be a genius high school author. Like any other handsome and young author, he had countless of female fans; and this was probably thanks to Zhao Youyue. Otherwise, with his messy, unkempt demeanor, he would not have any market value whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Now, magazines easily used photos of him. He was the male version of Lin Shiya, relying on his appearance to sell his books. If his next book was poorly written, people who had been jealous of him would jump up to say that he was a \u201chandsome guy with an ugly vocabulary\u201d\u2026</p><br/><p>His cross-dressing history also became a recurring meme among his fans. With the power of makeup, he was drop-dead gorgeous.</p><br/><p>The perpetrator was most delighted to the scene that unfolded before her eyes, as Han Leng was practically her creation\u2026</p><br/><p>The second person to discover the \u201cpedestrian\u201d Lady Zhao would be Han Leng.</p><br/><p>For an instant, he felt the nostalgia of the good old days.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Of all the music sheets that were scattered all over on the floor, she picked one music sheet at random. When she saw the notes on the music sheet, instantly, she heard music inside her brain, and she could also predict the next chords because she had the trait of having perfect pitch.</p><br/><p>She could also use music to express her feelings and beautiful attachment to this world with ease.</p><br/><p>Not only could she express her feelings, she could express anything with music. When the audiences listen to her music, she could choose to give them the lightness of a comedy, or she could choose the dark tones of tragedy.</p><br/><p>It would never be boring whenever she is playing music, she would make everyone in the world enjoy music!</p><br/><p>This is the power of a girl who had the blessings of the musical God!</p><br/><p>Her musical standards were even higher than the \u201cIndoor elite\u201d that Liu Yuxi had mentioned!</p><br/><p>Besides music, her psyche was at its best too, because she is an optimistic, strong-willed and confident girl.</p><br/><p>She felt that she had an open mind, and every little thing would cheer her up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue realized that she was fond of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d because she was giving off endless waves of positive energy. Who wouldn\u2019t like a beautiful girl filled with positive energy?</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was already part of Zhao Youyue as well.</p><br/><p>The realm \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d existed in had the same energy level as our reality.

This would never happen to Zhao Youyue, because she had the mentality of a saint.</p><br/><p>If it was not for her saint mentality, she would have already collapsed when she realizes that she does not have the ability of an esper and Saber \u201cLi Yunlong.\u201d In fact, she would pretend that it was a wonderful dream because those abilities were not hers originally. She did not deserve that power, because she never strived for them.</p><br/><p>As long as things go according to plan, she knew that she would be sticking around for a long time in the realm of \u201cBeautiful April,\u201d or at least until the main hero and heroine ends up together, she was afraid that the author would screw things up.

Whether she obtains that ability in reality, it was totally up to fate; everything would come to her in due time.</p><br/><p>Of course, there will be accidents too. For instance, the character card \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was an accident previously.</p><br/><p>Reality was indeed dull, novelists and mangakas, on the other hand, would always create a world with their imagination and bring some pleasant surprises to her, sometimes.</p><br/><p>At this very moment, Zhao Youyue could feel the symptoms of disease in \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d body. Zhao Youyue never bothered to give a name to the illness that Chu Luoxun had. It was a disease that weakens and paralyzes the body over time, something similar to Hawking\u2019s Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Hawking never died, but Chu Luoxun must die.</p><br/><p>This disease was precisely the same disease that had caused the death of the main hero\u2019s mother, and it was perfect for the plot.</p><br/><p>The death of the main hero\u2019s mother had caused him to stop playing the piano, but the music of Chu Luoxun would save him.

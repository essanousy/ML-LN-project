The conflict happened merely because of Zhao Youyue\u2019s overly indulgent attitude when it came to good food, and her carefree attitude towards money. After all, only a handful of students were as wealthy as her.</p><br/><p>Her pocket money was even higher than the monthly income of actual white-collars, which made it all quite awkward.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao, who had put that unhappy incident far behind her mind, began her skillful desk mate teaching plan, also known as the plan of \u201cone who touches ink will be stained black.\u201d She did not expect to influence her desk mate into someone like Jiang Qing Little Angel, but, at least someone who was easier for her to boss around, compared to Han Leng, the Adolescent delusion hipster, as he would occasionally revert to abnormality and talk about idiotic matters</p><br/><p>She enjoyed being free of him, but it did not last long. Boredom soon emerged of her not being in the same class as The Great Scholar Han. She had to hunt for a new toy.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue courteously greeted her new desk mate, Shen Menglian. She appeared vaguely familiar, but she could not put a name to the face.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, she knew it now. Shen Menglian, it was a good name.</p><br/><p>Shen Menglian was dumbstruck about the fact that she was now Zhao Youyues\u2019 desk mate. What a coincidence!</p><br/><p>This incident brings us the lesson \u2013 what goes around comes around.</p><br/><p>Similarly, this coincides with Murphy\u2019s Law \u2014 whatever that can go wrong, will go wrong.</p><br/><p>This seating arrangement showed the lengths Yan Liqun took in considering the roles of top students like them. Usually, those who sat at the first two rows would have to lift up their heads while looking at the blackboard, which would result in sore necks after a long time. Therefore, the third and the fourth rows had the most excellent views, while those behind them would only have a vision full of hair and the back of heads.</p><br/><p>Art subjects happened to be Shen Menglian weaker link, albeit only slightly. She could improve easily, if she is willing to learn from Zhao Youyue</p><br/><p>At that moment, Shen Menglian winced at the friendliness of Zhao Youyue. Has she completely placed all the bad blood behind her? Prior to this, she had looked down on Zhao Youyue, thinking that she had to be a poor student. Oh, how misled had she been!</p><br/><p>If she is Zhao Youyue, she would definitely take Shen Menglian, that little b***h, down!</p><br/><p>Shen Menglian was indeed a wily person. Since Zhao Youyue was being so kind to her, she might as well play friends with her. However, she would not hesitate to stab Zhao Youyue in the back when the opportunity presents itself!</p><br/><p>She could also cause her double the pain by first becoming Zhao Youyue\u2019s best friend in order to gain her trust, before betraying her. Wasn\u2019t this the perfect plan for revenge?</p><br/><p>If Zhao Youyue could mind read, she would have made a snarky comment, \u201cCould this be the legendary Masamune-kun\u2019s Revenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, Shen Menglian smiled and started to chit chat with Zhao Youyue. She too expressed her admiration for Zhao Youyue. She wasn\u2019t planning to be sincere on many things, but her respect of this lady\u2019s results was actually genuine.</p><br/><p>As someone who placed great emphasis on her results, Shen Menglian wanted to pick up some tips from Zhao Youyue in the name of friendship. She did not think that she was stupid. Hence, she firmly believed that Zhao Youyue must have her own secrets!</p><br/><p>Soon, they got along with each other, under Shen Menglian\u2019s pretense.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhao Youyue felt that Shen Menglian was much more interesting than Jiang Qing and Han Leng. She seemed to have already mastered the skill of flattery which implied that she knew how the world worked.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, Shen Menglian truly believed that Zhao Youyue just wanted to make friends with her. Was that the truth?</p><br/><p>Well, one could not afford to disregard her superficial charm, right?</p><br/><p>The moment when Shen Menglian thought that everything was unfolding according to her plan, the voice of Bai Yunshan came from behind: \u201cZhao Youyue, Shen Menglian was the one who told me that you were playing with your cell phone while Teacher Yang was speaking just now. I knew that she wanted me to be the one telling him, and so I granted her wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what Bai Yunshan said, the fake smile on Shen Menglian\u2019s face vanished without a trace. Compared to Zhao Youyue, their class monitor who did not know the ways of the world was far more disgusting!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue tilted her head, and with her usual cute yet kind smile, said, \u201cOh really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Menglian realized out of a sudden that Zhao Youyue was not familiar with Bai Yunshan\u2019s attitude at all. Those who knew her well knew that she would never say a lie, and was more straight-laced than a computer. She was not even afraid of letting others know that she was the one who ratted them out. So what?</p><br/><p>Shen Menglian quickly defended herself, saying, \u201cThere is no such thing! How could I have done so, if I looked up to you? She is just joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not joking. I am telling the truth. Well, it is up to you to believe it or not. Zhao Youyue, you\u2019d better be careful, don\u2019t be so nave,\u201d Bai Yunshan frowned slightly which emitted a mysterious force. Apparently, she was unhappy about the Shen Menglian\u2019s dishonesty.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhao Youyue had ever been perceived as a nave person. If Han Leng hears of this, he would surely shout furiously, saying that Lady Zhao was a Pure Black, [1] and those who have allowed themselves to be deceived by her apparently navety would definitely be unable to escape from her manipulative hands!</p><br/><p>Qiu Ya, who sat beside Bai Yunshan, shivered. She seemed like an introvert. She wore thick, black-rimmed spectacles and had her hair done up in a typical plait ponytail. These made her look like an old-fashioned girl. Indeed, she came from a countryside\u2019s junior high school. Things must be hard for her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue smiled gently, and then she smoothed thing over by saying, \u201cWell, what\u2019s done is done. Let\u2019s not make a fuss about it, shall we? We are all good students!\u201d</p><br/><p>That swept away all of Sheng Menglian\u2019 worries. Lady Zhao now seemed like an idiot to her, and this made her believe that she would have total control over her.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunshan was discontented with the ambivalent attitude of Zhao Youyue, thinking that she had distrusted the wrong party!</p><br/><p>Thus, she said, \u201cIt is far from over. If I see you with your cell phone again, be it during the class or the recess hour, I will tell on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had never met such a bold whistle-blower before. Was she not afraid of being isolated by the classmates?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! She was not afraid of it.</p><br/><p>The aloof yet righteous Bai class monitor who cared not for a single soul as described by her former assistant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d Zhao Youyue asked helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it is disrespectful to the teacher!\u201d Bai Yunshan shot back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal if the teacher does not notice, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, as long as I do not notice it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou definitely will notice it if you are just behind me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph. That\u2019s your problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were starting to hate each other now!</p><br/><p>Shen Menglian was over the moon. They were incompatible, as she had expected!</p><br/><p>The war between the two Missies had been ignited!</p><br/><p>This was so exciting!</p><br/><p>This was the victory of Menglian!</p><br/><p>After this, she must comfort Lady Zhao so that she could become her best friend, and then betray her!</p><br/><p>Translation Note</p><br/><p>[1] Pure Black. A Japanese word . A Pure Black person is pure and innocent yet underhanded and two-faced at the same time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Albeit retired, Grandpa Zhao appeared to be influential as ever. This is the situation in China since the ancient times, though there is a saying, \u201cThe intimacy between people will fade away as they separate for long\u201d. Anyway, there must be someone who had inherited the political heritage before he retired. The only thing to be feared was that the new leader might exercise an opposite political ideology, then the people would lash out at Grandpa Zhao as the people always adapt to the style of the current leader.</p><br/><p>Anyway, the Zhao family was quite a handful. Know that their ancestors were the founding members of the Republic of China. It was like owning \u201cThe Gold Medallion[1]\u201d during ancient times, as long as they were well-behaved, their wealth was able to last for several generations. In terms of power, Zhao Youyue\u2019s generation was obviously not on par with the elder generations.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao, Zhao Youyue\u2019s cousin was the most valued member of her generation. Grandpa Zhao would always have this beloved grandson, Zhao Hao at his side to welcome the guests of honor. He wanted Zhao Hao to interact more with these people as Zhao Hao was already the CEO of an investment company founded by his own.</p><br/><p>However, those people who got to know Zhao Hao would consider him as a prodigal son. Well, he was indeed talented in spending money, but an entrepreneur? Forget about it.</p><br/><p>Luckily he was not in the officialdom, as he would not last a second with that attitude.</p><br/><p>The successors of Grandpa Zhao had no special talents of their own. The magnificent Zhao family would definitely sink once Grandpa Zhao was no longer around. None of them was actually wise enough to support the family\u2019s current stage and wealth, especially the third-generation Zhao Hao. He was good for nothing, but to one\u2019s surprise, he had never committed any crime, neither did he smoke or drink alcohol. Fortunately!</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao liked to collect luxury sports cars, but he crashed two of his rides that cost more than ten millions before. He came home this year with his black domineering SUV, which looked exactly like an armored car with its rectangular shape, he even organized his own racing team to participate in a super series race. This had helped Zhao Youyue to gain some knowledge about cars, although she had no interest in cars and only thought of them as a mode of transportation.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao was fond of beautiful girls too, as he mingle around with ladies when he was still a student. Now he was in a relationship with a female actress, while keeping contact with his ex-girlfriends, obviously a scumbag. To a guy that did not have to worry about money, it was not too bad\u2026</p><br/><p>Basketball and games were Zhao Hao\u2019s favorite too, he would go to America to support his favorite NBA team every year. Besides that, he liked to watch Esports tournaments on site, he even would be invited as a special guest too.</p><br/><p>In comparison with Zhao Hao, his cousin Zhang Wanjun was way better than him. She gave a good impression to Zhao Youyue, with ladylike temperaments and good looking facial features. She was studying in a famous university in Shanghai, about the same level with Jiangnan University, and she was one of the student council members too. Zhang Wanjun was already on her third year, but she did not take care of herself nor putting on make-up, her skin was not as good as Zhao Youyue, even though most of the girls were already looked different when they entered university level.</p><br/><p>No doubt, there was something else more important than appearance to Zhang Wanjun. Was it studying?</p><br/><p>The possibility was quite big, since she was giving off a brilliance aura. She was wearing frameless spectacles, with the lens reflecting her coolness. Her hair was even shorter than Zhao Youyue, and her voice was of neutral tone, which sounded tomboyish. This rendered a beautiful girl like her to gain an even higher sense of presence. Too bad Grandpa Zhao was not fond of her, probably because her surname was not \u201cZhao\u201d. She was destined to become \u201csomeone else\u2019s child\u201d, otherwise she could be the role model of Zhao Youyue and Zhao Hao.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue thought that Zhang Wanjun and Zhao Hao were close, but she realized that these two did not belong to the same group. One was obviously showing off his wealth while another looked like a normal person, nobody would have guessed that she was the daughter of a mayor.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue activated her \u201cside character halo\u201d as usual, watching everyone else in the Zhao\u2019s family quietly, no one had noticed her, and she already gotten used to being ignored.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao Hao, these two sisters are in your care today, bring them out and have fun before we part ways. Take good care of Xiao Youyue especially, I\u2019ve never seen you taking care of her or giving her red packet. Do you become the eldest brother for nothing?\u201d Zhao Jiaren rebuked his son.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiaren was the pillar of the Zhao\u2019s family currently, and he treasured family bonds. He took great care of his youngest brother Zhao Jiayi, and he treated Zhao Youyue like his own daughter. He was one of few people who did not ignore Zhao Youyue. Zhao Youyue was fond of her uncle too, she was delighted whenever she received a red packet from him.</p><br/><p>On hearing his father request, Zhao Hao\u2019s face turned sour. \u201cUgh\u2026 Zhang Wanjun is hard to get along with, how are we going to have fun? Wait a minute, who\u2019s Xiao Youyue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he have a sister?</p><br/><p>He did, but why had he never noticed her?</p><br/><p>Such a mysterious sister!</p><br/><p>Her name was Zhao Youyue, she just entered high school and was pretty much pampered by her daddy\u2026</p><br/><p>After being reminded, Zhao Hao remembered a little bit about Zhao Youyue, he then turned his head towards his little cousin Zhao Youyue. She was standing at the corner as if she was isolated from the world, watching everyone like a bystander.</p><br/><p>What the!?</p><br/><p>He had such a cute little sister with a ponytail?</p><br/><p>He had thought that every little sister in the world was unamiable as Zhang Wanjun!</p><br/><p>Despite being very close to her, above any ordinary brother and sister, and having sent her a lot of gifts, he was still unable to resonate with Zhang Wanjun\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! I will bring them out to have fun, and eat lots of great food too!\u201d Zhao Hao tapped his chest with confidence.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao agreed to babysit them because he was interested in his cousin Zhao Youyue. Of course, it was not any love interest. He already had a girlfriend, and considered her much prettier than Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>As he was not interested in anime or manga, he did not have any sister complex. One reason he could not communicate with his cousin Zhang Wanjun was that she would use anime terms that he could not understand at all.</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] The Gold Medallion \u2013 A medallion that could protect one\u2019s family during the ancient Chinese era, not even an emperor could harm the holder.</p>\n</div>"}

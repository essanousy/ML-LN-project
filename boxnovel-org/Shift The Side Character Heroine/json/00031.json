This so-called internal injury was very much dire. If proper treatment is given in a timely manner, Xu Jing\u2019s mother would not need to face the music. However, her mother did not want to burden her again due to this injury, and decided to hide the truth. Eventually, the internal injury deteriorated and took her mother\u2019s last breath.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Su Li did not know anything at all, not realizing the extent of the internal injury. The last thing that crossed her mind was death. It was obvious that she wanted Xu Jing\u2019s mother to die at all costs. Moreover, this move was to set Xu Jing free in order to get involved in a couple relationship.</p><br/><p>The mangaka personally felt that Xu Jing deserved no mercy. After the death of Xu Jing\u2019s mother, her father was diagnosed with a chronic disease. He had a sudden relapse which cost his life, leaving her in great debt. Xu Jing suddenly experienced a huge transition in her life and became an orphan. Consequently, she had to work after coming back from school to clear off the debts.</p><br/><p>If all goes to Su Li\u2019s grand plan, Xu Jing would be forced by the moneylender to prostitute herself, where Yang Ming, the male protagonist would appear and save her from misery. From then onwards, Xu Jing would fall in love with him and put herself at risk in numerous situations to compete for Yang Ming, even going so far as to defeat her best friend, Yang Xixi.</p><br/><p>This kind of story which involved fights between two best friends to win over a guy\u2019s heart would pretty much disgust numerous female readers, as it always occurred in real life. As the saying goes, \u201cto prevent fire, theft and also best friend\u201d, but the male readers would usually find this interesting to read. They wanted all the nice girls to fall deeply in love with the main character. Because they had imagined themselves as the male protagonist. The reader population of this book was mostly male readers.</p><br/><p>Undeniably, the mangaka attempted to portray the strong rapport between Xu Jing and Yang Xixi. When it was the time that Xu Jing had to end the rapport to show her true love for the male protagonist, the male readers would definitely be thrilled over this scene. The fight scene between two girls over one guy is well worth to watch, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>As for the final ending, it was pretty obvious that all the girls would be deeply in love with the male protagonist and agreed to meet each other halfway. All of them agreed with the male protagonist that no matter how many girlfriends he had, it would not be that horrible as long as they remained in his heart. In the end, the male protagonist had a happy life living with his girls. Naturally this was the ideal ending of the story that the readers wanted. Besides, many of the Harem novels and manga were mainly like that, just because love could always be granted forgiveness.</p><br/><p>However, due to high prevalence of such mainstream ending, the novel \u201cPure Romance\u201d might be forgotten as time ticked away. Any different Harem stories produced by other mangakas could easily replace the novel. Once Xu Jing became one of the plain jane-s, she would lose her unique charisma, or hatred would even fall upon her. This was mostly due to the demeaning action of hers which seemed \u201cmistress-like\u201d. Anyway, the dispute actions between her and her best friend for the sake of a guy was definitely not suitable for Xu Jing\u2019s character setting. If she had done this, it would ruin everything about herself and it seemed impossible to become the epic character in the novel.</p><br/><p>Hence, Zhao Youyue acted decisively by taking over the latter storyline. The death of Xu Jing\u2019s parents had given her a chance to change. The moneylender she met was not really devilish as you could think of, instead the moneylender was a good friend of her parents. When the moneylender knew about the predicament faced by Xu Jing, the feeling of sympathy lured in, telling Xu Jing to return the money slowly without pushing hard on her.</p><br/><p>This setting seemed a lot like something which flashed through the minds of readers. It was believed that when the readers came across this scene, they would feel a relax sensation for Xu Jing since she was not tortured anymore. Moreover, Xu Jing would be clearing off the debts by continuing on her study and work life. This image was certainly more impressive than her becoming the Harem of the male protagonist and one of the plain jane-s.</p><br/><p>The person who recommended her a job would be none other than her best friend, Yang Xixi. She would go to Yang Xixi\u2019s house every weekend, helping Yang Xixi to clean her house without asking for any rewards. Most of the readers would think that in the process, Xu Jing might fell in love with the male protagonist Yang Ming, but they were absolutely wrong this time!</p><br/><p>Yang Ming was pretty shy than what you could have imagined. He would tackle the female characters unconsciously, as he was a man who was passive and not responsive in terms of couple relationships. What did he have up his sleeves as a male protagonist to tackle Xu Jing?</p><br/><p>Xu Jing was a tough and determined person who did not need any form of sympathy and empathy from any other person. She would walk out from the strong waves with her both hands.</p><br/><p>After her parents left her alone, as a single lady deep inside her heart, she would only recognize Yang Xixi as her best friend.</p><br/><p>Xu Jing could really do anything for Yang Xixi to be happy!</p><br/><p>But she had never agreed that it could bring happiness to Yang Xixi by loving her own brother was something, instead it would only cause Yang Xixi to be in dismay.</p><br/><p>The truth was that Xu Jing had turned into a darkened self right after her parents passed away. This resulted in her huge possessiveness towards Yang Xixi, up till the level where she could not live without her for a single second. Xu Jing placed all of her faith and love into Yang Xixi and was deeply in love with her. This was certainly a distorted kind of love. If it was not due to the obstacles that hurled her life, she would not become the person she was now.</p><br/><p>Thus, when Yang Xixi talked to her about love issues, she twisted her lips, lowered her head, and soon her eyes lost focus\u2026</p><br/><p>Why would Yang Xixi always talk about Yang Ming?</p><br/><p>Was he any good?</p><br/><p>Such useless brother who could not even understand his own sister\u2019s thoughts could have just died for good sake!</p><br/><p>But I could not lay a finger on him, if Yang Xixi found out about this, she would hate me the most\u2026</p><br/><p>Indeed, there was no need for me to act. Weren\u2019t there so many idiotic girls surrounding him?</p><br/><p>Those girls should die as well!</p><br/><p>If it was not because of them, how would Xixi be so troubled?</p><br/><p>It was all because of Yang Ming\u2019s fault, and the bunch of girls. As long as they did not live, Xixi would be happy and as long as I stayed, I shall make Xixi a happy person!</p><br/><p>With an elite scholar being darkened, that would usually give rise to a powerful destruction!</p><br/><p>The disturbance of Xu Jing, or rather Zhao Youyue, shall now begin!</p><br/><p>Xu Jing first took the initiative to befriend Yang Ming\u2019s childhood friend, Li Xiaotong through the help of Yang Xixi. Li Xiaotong was a cunning and thoughtful girl. Although she appeared to be energetic with her bright smile, she liked to support the male protagonist, making him become her own property, and would not let anyone snatch him away.</p><br/><p>Then, Xu Jing met Li Xiaotong secretly. On her first line, Li Xiao Tong\u2019s smile diminished in a glimpse of time. She told XiaoTong, \u201cI thought you should have perceived that the love of Yang Xixi to her own brother was more than just siblings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaotong snorted and said, \u201cSo what if it was true? As always, Ah Ming will only see her as his sister. They are not even from the same bloodlines. Is there something bothers you? You are merely a loyal follower of Yang Xixi. Did she send you here to provoke me?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expressionless as ever, Xu Jing only uttered, \u201cI came to help you.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

He felt himself to be invincible. Even if he felt a little inferior in the face of Lady Zhao in reality, but within the novel, he did not bother much about the Ladies from better family backgrounds, compared to Lady Zhao\u2019s. He could easily manipulate them, anyway he wanted to</p><br/><p>Han Leng had long harbored great self-confidence towards his writings. However, he could do nothing when faced with the situation where he has written his beloved character to death. He could not even sleep well!</p><br/><p>He had a strong hunch that he might never be able to write out another character like \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 anymore.</p><br/><p>Writers are misunderstood creatures. The general public often develops misconceptions about how they functioned as well. They believed that the more they write, the older they get, and the more interesting their works will be.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, High Gods would never fall. They would not have lost their popularity, having fallen silent.</p><br/><p>We only can say that the longer time one spends on writing, the better their writing techniques would become, and the more techniques they would master. The craftiness within their writings will increase as well, but it may never produce the same spirit as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful April\u201d was a piece of work, full of spirit. Han Leng was not saying this to make himself feel better. He knew so. The plot seemed relatively simple, it had fewer twists and turns than mystery novels. However, every musical performance that took place within it was a classic among classics!</p><br/><p>Conversely, some aspects of its emotion might have been over-the-top, or naive. Some female readers who have read too many romance novels would consider them shallow and awkward. Love relationships in reality are not like that. However, he was just a high school student. Such was his understanding towards emotions.</p><br/><p>The emotions of this novel had been fixated on one channel. The idea of a perfect first love between the male protagonist Gu Yuan and the heroine Lin Meiyue. He had fed it various kind of dog foods, satisfying himself in his own writings, after the failure of his first love experience\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>This was the fantasy that had played out in his mind, if his first love had been successful.</p><br/><p>He had laid it all out on paper.</p><br/><p>It would definitely seem childish from an adult\u2019s perspective. However, it was this childishness, his perfect depiction of a first love, that had touched many readers, arousing the \u2018feminine heart\u2019 within. These readers were also the most determined members of \u2018Lin Meiyue\u2019s\u2019 fan club.</p><br/><p>He had intended to write a simple, first love story from the beginning.</p><br/><p>It was just like what he said. It would be an unconventional youth novel.</p><br/><p>However, he did not expect the male protagonist\u2019s opponent in music to shine so brightly, to such an extent!</p><br/><p>This character had destroyed the main storyline of Han Leng\u2019s entire novel. She was supposed to be a supporting role, yet she somehow became the true heroine. She was a maverick, a rebel in more than one way!</p><br/><p>Han Leng was not in his \u2018intoxicated\u2019 state anymore. He regretted creating such a brilliant female character. It would not have been so troublesome if he had written things, according to his original idea!</p><br/><p>However, he knew himself well. If he were to rewrite, he would still choose \u2018Chu Luoxun.\u2019 She was not his ideal girlfriend, but the Goddess in his heart!</p><br/><p>Goddesses could only be viewed from afar. They can never be embraced. There is always such a Goddess within a man\u2019s heart. This also applied to the opposite sex.</p><br/><p>Men and women are together in this matter. Even if the so-called God or Goddess truly appears in front of them and takes a fancy to them, they may not necessarily like them. However, writers loved to add such imaginative plot devices to their literary works.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the male protagonist Gu Yuan had never thought of having any improper relationships with Chu Luoxun. He treated her as his best friend and rival. His heart had been with Lin Meiyue since the beginning.</p><br/><p>Yet, Han Leng changed his mind during the later stage. He had a new preference!</p><br/><p>That threatened to shake the very foundations of his novel!</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun would of course be blamed for causing trouble\u2026</p><br/><p>In order to portray Chu Luoxun\u2019s greatness and her charm, he purposely wrote Gu Yuan\u2019s doubt and confusion, giving the Chu Luoxun fan club some false hope. He had even utilized ambiguous words when it came to writing Chu Luoxun\u2019s feelings towards Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>Han Leng knew that Chu Luoxun felt no affection towards Gu Yuan, yet he intended to ship them together. Due to his incredible writing technique, a possibility of Chu Luoxun\u2019s great, secret affection which was worth thousands of words emerged within Chu Luoxun\u2019s fan club! A ten-year affection!</p><br/><p>Goddess Chu loved Gu Yuan too deeply, yet she knew that she was not able to live much longer. Therefore, in exchange for his happiness, she chose to\u2026</p><br/><p>This was definitely Han Leng\u2019s fault!</p><br/><p>Han Leng had also ruined the character setting for Lin Meiyue. She was originally an innocent, kind, gentle and considerate girl. She would never make Chu Luoxun\u2019s music compositions her own, on purpose. However, in order to show Lin Meiyue\u2019s true affection towards Gu Yuan, she was willing to do anything for love.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, Lin Meiyue\u2019s image, in the beginning, was without any distinguishing features. However, thanks to Han Leng\u2019s imagination on a \u2018perfect first love,\u2019 she did those things for love, and eventually became her own character.</p><br/><p>In reality, most women can never withstand a Goddess like Chu Luoxun. She is too much of a threat. She brings out all their insecurities and shines a spotlight on their flaws. All they can do is to falsely discredit Chu Luoxun as the scariest \u2018mistress\u2019 candidate. They hated such women the most. Most men will fall into her temptation.</p><br/><p>Han Leng was actually very dissatisfied with the happy ending between the male protagonist and heroine.</p><br/><p>His beloved female character had passed away just like that. They had no right to live happily ever after!</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was irate about Lin Mei Yue\u2019s lie about her fraudulent title as the \u2018Genius Composer,\u2019 to remain uncovered. He should have given her a worse ending!</p><br/><p>Han Leng was definitely one of a kind. From a writer who initially had a high preference for the male protagonist and heroine of his novel, to later start flaming them. We can all see how much pain it is for him to kill off Chu Luoxun.</p><br/><p>Han Leng almost fail to control himself from separating the protagonist and heroine!</p><br/><p>However, he managed to calm himself down. He remembered that he had once promised to provide a happy ending\u2026</p><br/><p>He did not separate them. He continued to express his feelings through his writing. He concluded his novel unwillingly.</p><br/><p>The heroine had inherited Chu Luoxun\u2019s violin, hadn\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>Han Leng then wrote that the male protagonist dusted and stared at the violin every day. Of course, he did it in secret.</p><br/><p>He had even written that Lin Meiyue was suspected of being a fraud and almost exposed as she spoke to other composers in length.</p><br/><p>In the end, the male protagonist and the heroine lived together \u2018happily\u2019 ever after.</p><br/><p>Han Leng felt a mysterious power preventing him from modifying the scenes related to Chu Luoxun. The same feeling did not appear when it came to scenes related to the male protagonist and the heroine.</p><br/><p>He had modified the ending in such a way for his ideas to be accessible, and also to release his anger on Chu Luoxun\u2019s behalf!</p><br/><p>After Han Leng was done, he sent a message to Zhao Youyue via Wechat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Zhao, allow me to tell you the truth. Actually, I am Leng Zi, the author of \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Today, she was so excited to see her daughter finally becoming the center of attention!</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Zhao Jiayi was happy as well, but not as excited as his wife. His only expectation of her daughter was to grow up healthily and happily. She has the right to choose her own life. Be it average or outstanding, it was all up to her. He would not force her to do anything.</p><br/><p>He was very open-minded in educating his daughter, yet, it had cultivated a self-assertive personality in Zhao Youyue. On the surface, she seemed to be unperturbed by it, but she already had a mind of her own.</p><br/><p>The only problem was that Zhao Youyue has never expressed it before, and she never thought of expressing her own mind either. Perhaps, being hidden in the crowd as a side character and following the trend by observing the world, was relaxing and interesting for her.</p><br/><p>Just like a saint, who is never involved in any form of karma and remaining totally disconnected with the world.</p><br/><p>However, by having the perfectly neutral soul after the merging of her souls, she became more pro-active. She once was content at being common and mediocre.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, she would express the supremacy of a heroine in crucial moments. Then, she would hide her credit and fame and become a side character again, silently observing the reactions of the people to the troubles she leaves behind</p><br/><p>The gorgeous and dazzling appearance of Zhao Youyue when she won the prize had astonished a person too, and that was Han Leng, who had deliberately taken leave of his job and came to see her compete. But, do not misunderstand him. He was there to seek inspiration, and much of it did he gain.</p><br/><p>Apart from seeing Zhao Youyue\u2019s precisely perfect and professional level violin performance, he had also witnessed the comic relief who played \u201caLiez\u201d and even tried to give the designated song a personal touch. However, they were harshly criticized by the judges!</p><br/><p>This gave him some introspective insight of his \u201cBeautiful April.\u201d Fortunately, Chu Luoxun was never directly scolded by the Chief Judge, or else, it would be so awkward. She would look like another poorly mannered participant who came only to mess the competition up</p><br/><p>To be frank, Han Leng was completely amazed by Zhao Youyue\u2019s performance today, just not the music. After all, he did not completely understand classical music. It was her overall performance that amazed him.</p><br/><p>The moment she held the violin and went up to the stage in the elegant long dress and light make-up, her nature as a \u201cside character\u201d seemed to vanish and she had transformed into the \u201cheroine\u201d!</p><br/><p>Han Leng was used to her low-profile behavior in school. This was why he was profoundly amazed by her elegance, today!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, he never expected that Zhao Youyue would have such a great attainment when it comes to playing the violin. He thought she was at the same level with the Lin Meiyue, the heroine in his book, the kind that was just there to round up the numbers. As a result, Zhao Youyue\u2019s true nature had given him a slap on his face</p><br/><p>The real Zhao Youyue and the one he had envisioned were completely different!</p><br/><p>Han Leng felt that his heroine, Lin Meiyue, was merely his fantasy, who was not even qualified to be a watered-down version of Zhao Youyue. She seemed only to have the side of Zhao Youyue which was a low-profile side character, while her side which was akin to a heroine with a strong sense of presence was absent.</p><br/><p>A side character heroine would not only possess the nature of a side character but the nature of a heroine too. Therefore, what kind of person is the heroine?</p><br/><p>A girl who had a strong sense of presence, unique charm and the ability to shine at any time, while also having many fans and worshipers, of course!</p><br/><p>The world would revolve around her!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was amassing her competence gradually as she forms the foundation of her heroineship.</p><br/><p>That night, her parents brought her for a feast as a celebration. They had invited Zhao Youyue\u2019s teacher, Liu Yuxi, too.</p><br/><p>However, Liu Yuxi now claimed herself to be Zhao Youyue\u2019s sister, indicating that she totally disdained being the bestie of Wang Yan. Meanwhile, she too was not happy with Zhao Jiayi, who had taken away Wang Yan from her</p><br/><p>Anyway, everyone was in a good mood. After all, they were sincerely happy for the achievement of Zhao Youyue.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi, who loved organizing dinners, had already sent the news of his daughter\u2019s victory to his friends. He wanted to treat them dinner to celebrate the excellence of his daughter.</p><br/><p>Wang Yan was happy about this too. Those wives of the leaders had been showing off the excellence of their children, and now it was her turn. Her daughter was a musical genius!</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, Zhao Youyue disliked dinner. It was normal for dinner to take up one to two hours and mostly last until 8 PM, and she found that to be a waste of time. Fortunately, she was skillful at playing the phone beneath the table. Moreover, she did not have to drink and was able to easily ingest some food and play the phone while following her parents around, greeting their friends. Then, she would become a side character again, and nobody would notice her.</p><br/><p>This dinner was simply a place to refresh contacts, rather than being a celebration.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had seen through its nature</p><br/><p>On the second day, Zhao Youyue, as usual, went to the school in uniform, as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. After all, there was a half-day\u2019s worth of self-study class in the morning section.</p><br/><p>Her classmates did not know the reason she took leaves, even though she did it often.</p><br/><p>Her presence or absence did not make much difference, as she had little interaction with other classmates.</p><br/><p>Although she has become the tip-top student, she would not talk to someone after class, if she is too lazy to answer the question during class. She would play with her phone alone, making herself \u201cinvisible\u201d again. Her presence really did not make any difference to the class.</p><br/><p>When she entered the classroom, most of her classmates were there, and have begun their morning reading. Then, she was shocked to discover that her Jiang Qing Little Angel had moved to the side of the dais!</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing saw her too, who was leisurely entering the classroom. Her eyes turned red immediately, and she started tearing up. How she wished to get into Lady Zhao\u2019s arms to seek for warmth and protection</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not walk to her seat first, but she walked to Jiang Qing. She asked in concern \u201cWhy are placed here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing wiped her face and helplessly said \u201cTeacher Qiu said that my results got worst after sitting beside you, that I am not putting effort into studying anymoreHe even said that I am actually a bright student with potential who needs to still her mind and study earnestly. That\u2019s why\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was speechless, as she had never been concerned about her studies. All she did was to bring this angel to play about. She was truly responsible for badly influencing Jiang Qing!</p><br/><p>Teacher Qiu had good insight!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was ashamed to request for Jiang Qing to become her desk mate as her way of studying was basically a malignant tumor for ordinary students. She was the existence of \u201cone who touches ink will be stained black\u201d.</p><br/><p>So, who was her desk mate now?</p><br/><p>She looked at the desk beside her</p>\n</div>"}

That was a very unnatural state, just like the author himself entering his own literary world, seen the plot develop with his own eyes, as well as the joys and sorrows of the character itself\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, he would simlpy write down everything that he has seen. Written text was the best state of reflection. Be it the words and sentences, or rhetorical devices, all those would be applied most appropriately. Even in that frenzy, no typo would ever occur!</p><br/><p>To be honest, Ye Hai himself missed that kind of state as well. It was indeed intoxicating and addictive, as if his hands would move by themselves, the moment he sits down in front of the computer and places his hands on the keyboard.</p><br/><p>There would be no doubt, no fear, no hesitation.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, with the departure of that \u2018intoxicated\u2019 state, writer\u2019s block would visit him once again. Although writing 6,000 words twice a day was still a walk in the park, he knew very well that the passionate state that he missed so much might never possibly appear in his life anymoreever</p><br/><p>Thus, all those scenes, sounds, characters\u2019 emotions, etc. had been deeply etched in his memories.</p><br/><p>This was especially the case for the character, Yu Shengfan. She was totally different from other characters, as if she truly had a life and soul. She was certainly a person that lived within his literary world. In other words, a life that had taken place in his literary world!</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ye Hai always had a special kind of feeling towards \u2018Yu Shengfan.\u2019 It was not romantic in nature, but it was something closer to a familial bond. If the work \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was his bride, the character \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 inside would be his daughter. He personally thought that it was his own pen that had given her life\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, when the voice of \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 that he missed so dearly appeared in reality, he would suddenly burst into life, as if he had found his long-lost daughter.</p><br/><p>When Li Mengyao saw this, she cleared her throat and said, \u201cPay attention, she\u2019s not \u2018Yu Shengfan,\u2019 she\u2019s Lady Zhao, Zhao Youyue\u2026 But her vocal control is incredible. She previously sounded like a very normal teenager. I didn\u2019t expect her to be able to change to a Lolita voice immediately at will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hai could not tell his wife that this voice was the very voice in his mind that \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 uttered. If Zhao Youyue\u2019s appearance was a lolita with blonde twintails, he might have lost his mind for real and believed himself to be within his own literary world once more\u2026</p><br/><p>After that, Zhao Youyue, or \u2018Yu Shengfan,\u2019 used her lolita voice again to utter many classic lines by Yu Shengfan within \u201cThe Strongest King.\u201d Ye Hai immediately concluded his decision, to set her as the VA for \u2018Yu Shengfan.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even Su Li sighed, saying, \u201cMy lady, I think that you are truly a VA genius. I should have assigned you to be the VA for \u2018Xu Jing.\u2019 If so, this character \u2018Xu Jing\u2019 would have certainly acted like herself in the anime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue switched off the \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s possession\u201d mode, and her temperament changed entirely. The profound loneliness and melancholy that spread throughout her body a moment ago disappeared entirely.</p><br/><p>Li Mengyao praised her as well, \u201cWhy would you still want to be a VA? You can be an actress already. You had everything spot-on, down to her mannerisms. That is too incredible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue spoke within her heart that no matter being a VA or an actress, she would only be able to act as \u2018Xu Jing\u2019 or \u2018Yu Shengfan,\u2019 because they were actually her other selves. That was the actual appearance of the characters. She would definitely be dumbfounded if she was asked to voice act or act as other characters.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue gladly accepted the job of being the VA for \u2018Yu Shengfan.\u2019 Since the recording session would take place during her summer vacation, she would have all the time in the world.</p><br/><p>Thanks to sly old Rosemary, \u2018Yu Shengfan\u201ds scenes were just that scarce. She only needed to voice act \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 until she dies of disease, and her job would be done. She would not need to voice act until the end of this work\u2026.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she replied, \u201cI can voice act for \u2018Yu Shengfan.\u2019 But there\u2019s one thing I would like to ask. Is an ordinary person like me who has never received any VA training before really capable of being her VA?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a swing of his big hand, Ye Hai replied, \u201cOf course! I\u2019ve absolutely chosen you. I believe that you would bring \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 to life. Just do it to your heart\u2019s content. You will be paid for this, of course. The salary will probably be given according to a new VA\u2019s rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Zhao Youyue heard that she would be paid, she felt happy. She had not yet earned any money from live streaming, since she had not signed any contracts with Douyu previously. Besides, the gift money that one receives for that particular month on Douyu would be delayed by three months\u2026</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Youyue was a lady, she always had a desire to earn money by herself. This was not because that she was lacking of money. It was to prove herself that she was not an ordinary student who could only survive by relying on her parents, but someone who is able to earn money with her own power!</p><br/><p>Ye Hai was always a resolute person. When he first said that he wanted to be partners with Su Li, the mangaka, he did so. The contract was settled within a few days. He was fine letting the other party have more benefits, as he was not that kind of selfish, childish author.</p><br/><p>This was a similar situation. Since he had selectively chosen Zhao Youyue, he immediately called the animation supervisor of \u201cThe Strongest King,\u201d informing that he had found the best VA for \u2018Yu Shengfan.\u2019</p><br/><p>The animation supervisor was Dong Yang. He had been serving as the supervisor for quite a number of excellent animation works. His works were nothing spectacular, but they were without flaws. He was also very responsible towards his own works.</p><br/><p>When Dong Yang answered Ye Hai\u2019s call, he felt that this original author was very unreliable. How could he simply choose someone to be a fixed VA for such an essential female character?</p><br/><p>He protested, \u201cTeacher Rosemary, you don\u2019t know much about animation after all. You totally don\u2019t understand how important it is to have a professional VA for the animation\u2019s characters. \u2018Yu Shengfan\u2019 is the most important female character in the early stage of this novel. She can even be considered the heroine of the arc! Yet, you got a person without any VA training experience to voice act for the heroine. Isn\u2019t this too careless? You need to know that, on the proseminar of the animation production, the company decided to let You Dinghui, the famous VA take the role. She\u2019s very experienced. She has a lot of fans. There are even rumors spreading, that a lot of the original\u2019s fans look forward to her voice acting\u2026Now that you\u2019ve suddenly made such a decision, this is really too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hai\u2019s attitude was unyielding. He said domineeringly, \u201cI don\u2019t care, I just want to assign her as the fixed VA. My eyes can\u2019t be wrong! Even a famous VA can never compare against the most suitable VA. Besides, I\u2019m saving your money!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

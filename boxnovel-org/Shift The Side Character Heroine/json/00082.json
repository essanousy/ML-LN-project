Zhao Youyue thought to herself. She was rather confident in doing so.</p><br/><p>Well, as one wealthy lady from a filthy rich family, she was afraid of being alone. But her parents were always busy with work, she had thus found herself a place in the world of games. She usually played her games alone, leading her to adopt this weird habit of mumbling to herself even though there was nobody around. So, she went cyber cafe solely for the lively atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Most players that came to Lin Feng\u2019s \u201cGlorious Cyber Cafe\u201d, would be playing \u201cEternal War \u201c. People gathered their friends to form parties for raiding quest, or even boss quest in the opening of a new server in game. Lady Yu Shengfan was a fan of this game as well, so she would come here to enjoy the lively and passionate atmosphere. This \u201cInternet addict lady\u201d, Yu Shengfan pursued nothing more than happiness in game. Besides, she could pick up another language to further improve her joyful gaming experience. These reasonings make her visits to the cyber cafe in a fancy more sensible, albeit grudgingly.</p><br/><p>Ah, one more reason! Yu Shengfan was curious about the life of commoners and she wanted to experience it as well\u2026</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue was making up all of this, Rosemary would describe more about the inner character of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, an attempt to give grounds for the event of \u201criding a limo to the cyber cafe\u201d and to path a way for her to meet up with Lin Feng in the later story.</p><br/><p>After possessing \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, Zhao Youyue started manifesting her character setting. Since she was a rich lady, she would buy all of her game equipment, unlike the other players who had to farm their own equipment through dungeons and raid missions. She thought the best part of this game was the PvP feature. She loved PvP!</p><br/><p>How does it feel to play a game inside a novel?</p><br/><p>\u201cEternal War \u201d was just like any other PC games, controlled with a mouse and keyboard. But once she started playing, she felt as if it was a 4D game, as if herself had become the swordmistress whom she was playing \u2014 \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d. Hmmm, to enter a game of the novel that she had entered, wasn\u2019t this feeling of double-shifting something like\u2026 \u201cInception\u201d?</p><br/><p>After some thoughts, this setting did not sound weird at all. Just think about those online-game animes or dramas, the camera would not stay behind the players, recording everything they were playing on the screen right? Instead, the player themselves would enter the world of games, putting on their dazzling character outfits\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, the character outfit of \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d would be awesome because she was rich. She would buy any equipment and item at auction once she got her eyes on them. Since \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d cared more about the looks over the uses, never would she hesitate to buy any fancy types of equipment.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt awesome to roleplay as a rich lady in the novel, as she would not have to worry about money at all. Of course, she also would not need to care about where the money came from! Indeed, the author had given her such a background, she would need to show off her traits in every way.</p><br/><p>If Rosemary first described \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d as a rich lady with lots of fancy items, she would actually become a rich lady in reality with styles and temperaments after Zhao Youyue possessed her. After all, Zhao Youyue could make the readers believe that the character she possessed was genuine.</p><br/><p>Only a mighty author could ever create characters that were lifelike, as if they had their own souls, able to roam freely in their own books.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Shengfan\u201d went into the arena after she logged into the game, and went for a one on one battle. Even though there was an option for five versus five, she had no trustworthy teammates or ally. To her, that was like one versus nine instead!</p><br/><p>As \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d walked towards the arena, she overheard the gossips about \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d. She ranked first in level, wealth and equipment in this new server, yet she was the champion in the solo PvP ranking arena!</p><br/><p>That was simply amazing. The rankings of first few categories might be bought with money, but it was definitely not the case for the solo PvP. In \u201cEternal War\u201d, winning the first place of solo PvP greatly demanded real player skills, while the five versus five battles demanded both player skills and the ability to see an overall picture of the game.</p><br/><p>Why would \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d have so many gossips about her?</p><br/><p>This was because, many opponents were humiliated by her! Not only she beat her opponents badly, yet she chronically had a chat bubble on top of her head, mocking others\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Where\u2019s your little pride when you\u2019re facing me? Dare not look me in the face?</p><br/><p>Your skills are way too awful, just die already and stop wasting my time.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re polluting the river if you jump into it. You\u2019re wasting the time if you die naturally. You\u2019re wasting the country money if you eat sleeping pills. And you\u2019re wasting the gas if you die of gas poisoning!</p><br/><p>Ugh, your character is hideous! And you\u2019re a mouthful, do you think you\u2019re me? Seeing your not serious way of gaming, I have known that your parents were not serious too when they were making you\u2026</p><br/><p>Among a myriad of weapons in game, but you decided to practice \u201csword[1]\u201d. You practiced lower[2] sword instead of upper sword, and you practiced drunken[3] sword out of so many lower swords, yet you practiced silver[4] sword instead of steel sword. Finally, you became one with your sword and turned into a \u2014 \u201cswordsman[5]\u201d! Still, I killed you with a single strike.</p><br/><p>If your \u201cnoob\u201d skills could ever generate electricity, nuclear generators from all over the world would stop supplying any.</p><br/><p>No A.I. could ever surpass the level of your natural stupidity.</p><br/><p>Bro, your character is so ugly that even a censored mosaic is better looking than it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Who was still able to enjoy the game while getting humiliated with such abusive words? No one but Lady \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d, she could always enjoy herself in a one on one battle!</p><br/><p>Besides, there were gossips about the gender of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d too though she had been revealing her moe lolita voice in game. Who would have believed that it was actually a girl with such gaming talent?</p><br/><p>Most people thought that she was actually a ladyboy with the use of voice altering gadget!</p><br/><p>Some gossip lovers even used a video to frame \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d. It was a video about a fat and ugly man, using his \u201clolita\u201d voice to talk with another person. Ugh, what an eyesore\u2026</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1. Sword \u2013 In Chinese, sword() and filthy/cheap() carry the same pronunciation as jian.</p><br/><p>2. Lower sword() xia jian \u2013 () refers to degrading.</p><br/><p>3. Drunken sword() zui jian \u2013 () refers to the most filthy/cheap.</p><br/><p>4. Silver sword() yin jian \u2013 () refers to lewd cheap.</p><br/><p>5. Swordsman() jian ren \u2013 () refers as filthy/cheap person.</p><br/><p>All these words are pronounced similarly to variations of the Chinese word of \u201csword\u201d(), which also mean filthy/cheap(). The speaker repetitively uses \u201csword\u201d to ridicule someone for being filthy/cheap.</p>\n</div>"}

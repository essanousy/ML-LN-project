Of course, they would not notice it themselves\u2026</p><br/><p>Before this, Han Leng had described the bond between Lin Meiyue and Chu Luoxin as unbreakable, their friendship was steadfast, but that was before Lin Meiyue became lovers with Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>He thought that love was selfish; it could change a person, or make a person grow. Under the influence of love, the simple and innocent Lin Meiyue had changed, perhaps for worse.</p><br/><p>This was not just Lin Meiyue\u2019s problem; Gu Yuan was at fault too. If only he could focus his attention entirely on Lin Meiyue, all of these would not happen at all. Lin Meiyue had occupied his entire life, except for music, and Chu Luoxun would always be brought up whenever they discussed about music\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was simply too outstanding, she was irreplaceable.</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue\u2019s music level was nowhere close to \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d standard.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan\u2019s EQ was average, but he was determined and decisive. Other guys would sway unsteadily between \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d and Lin Meiyue.</p><br/><p>With his average EQ, he had bluntly told Lin Meiyue that he was attracted to \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d music, and both of he and \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had something in common in music, including the time when he was performing together on stage with her.</p><br/><p>Things would have been better if he kept his mouth shut, but Gu Yuan felt that he should be honest with Lin Meiyue, because only music was between him and \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d He had a clear conscience on that matter.</p><br/><p>He would not even acknowledge \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d as his best friend, he only thought of her as a competitive partner, and he would try his best to defeat her. This was a mutual understanding between geniuses.</p><br/><p>As a girl, Lin Meiyue could not allow that, because she loved him, so she chose her own method of protecting her relationship.</p><br/><p>She would always be plagued by guilt in her heart which cannot be described by words; she knew that Gu Yuan loved her, but what about his music? Sometimes, only music can tell the truth.</p><br/><p>She always knew Gu Yuan had fallen in love with her because he had mistaken her as the girl who played the violin, or else they would not have even made it this far.</p><br/><p>What if that time, Gu Yuan had met \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d instead of her? Lin Meiyue dared not imagine the outcome\u2026</p><br/><p>She also admitted that she had only ended up with Gu Yuan because of \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d help. This made her feel like, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was giving away stuff that originally belonged to her. But \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d still had the ownership, and one day, she would take all those things back.</p><br/><p>Women are always overthinking, and in order to portray the greatness of Goddess Chu, Han Leng had made Lin Meiyue even more realistic, making her even more lively. She was no longer innocent and pure like she used to be. Because of love, women would change themselves.</p><br/><p>And so, to replace \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d music, Lin Meiyue had used the songs \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d created, and performed a duet with Gu Yuan, so that she could become closer to him. She even gave off the impression of a \u201cgenius composer,\u201d but all this belonged to \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue knew that doing this would cause more harm than good, but this was the only thing she could do. In the end, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d would still help her, right?</p><br/><p>Everything that Lin Meiyue had done was not wrong, because she cared about him. She gets jealous easily, and her desire to win him over to herself was too strong.</p><br/><p>Now that Lin Meiyue had exposed her real self to the readers, fans would surely flock to \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d This was precisely Han Leng\u2019s intention; he wanted to make a perfect imagery of the goddess, \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Lin Meiyue was a mere mortal compared to her.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan remained clueless about the problems between Lin Meiyue and \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d or to be more precise, Lin Meiyue having a problem with \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan decided to pay a visit to \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d alone. Even though a part of him did not want him to come, but whenever he plays the piano, he would always think of her, and all his worries would come pouring down.</p><br/><p>On the way to the hospital, he kept thinking about the moments he spent with \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Although he had spent even more time with Lin Meiyue, the memories with \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d were even more vivid!</p><br/><p>This made him conflicted; he felt that more than music existed between the two of them, and he had been lying to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never come visit again.\u201d \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 said to him weakly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought your favorite snacks.\u201d Gu Yuan replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still play the piano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s with Lin Meiyue? Still doing great?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the songs she created were great, she\u2019s a genius composer! I like the music scores she wrote, and I like performing with her too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026 So you came here just to show off your love to me?\u201d \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 laughed at him while pretending to be angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? No! I\u2019ve always wanted to come visit you; I just don\u2019t know what to talk with you\u2026\u201d Gu Yuan\u2019s tone had turned heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust be like how it used to be, let go of the past. You\u2019ll feel much better that way. Besides, there\u2019s no point hanging on to the past; my music can still be replaced. A violinist who can\u2019t even pick up her bow is a violinist without a purpose,\u201d \u2018Chu Luoxun\u2019 said, with a plain expression.</p><br/><p>At that moment, losing the ability to play the instrument was like nothing to her.</p><br/><p>Why\u2026 Why do you have to say such words, it was you who brought me back to the musical world, those unforgettable memories\u2026 How can I ever forget your music!</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan left the room; he felt terrible. Even though he did not want any of this to happen, but he could not do anything about it. He felt sad and miserable; she had given so much to him, and yet, he couldn\u2019t do anything for her!</p><br/><p>His mind was full of her brilliant image on stage, recalling every detail as she turned around and looked at him in the eyes with that beautiful face and that contagious smile.</p><br/><p>He had decided to perform for her in the upcoming music fest. He even told his plan to his girlfriend, Lin Meiyue. She hesitated for a moment, and she agreed, but she wanted to perform together for her as well, because \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was her best friend.</p><br/><p>Through a live video call, the two of them decided to perform for \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d\u2026</p>\n</div>"}

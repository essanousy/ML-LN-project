Anyway, many players had never heard her actual voice, plus she was always mocking people with her chat bubbles, people would rather play along in framing \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d. Don\u2019t forget her extreme wealthiness, nowadays many would hold jealousy against the rich.</p><br/><p>Hence, many players would be envious of the fancy, cool equipment of this \u201cGreat swordmistress\u201d as she walked towards the Arena. Just because they were all in the safe zone in which the system did not allow any PK-s, many of them who had been beaten up and humiliated by \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d would happily tag along to cuss and badmouth her whenever they saw any crowd booing her.</p><br/><p>Sitting in front of the screen reading all these chat bubbles, \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d smirked, \u201cThese weaklings are amusing, I wanna play games even more now!\u201d, she said to herself with her cute lolita voice.</p><br/><p>Speaking of that, she began to type without showing signs of her slowing down. Who cares if the crowd was talking crap about her, she would mock them in return one by one!</p><br/><p>\u201cI really couldn\u2019t think of any languages to reply to an alienate species, but since everyone greeted me with such sincerity, I had to reply everyone, I wouldn\u2019t want to be rude, you see? Be thankful for your princess, it would be your honors to receive my reply!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said I\u2019m thick skinned? I think yours is thicker, that even mosquitoes will have trouble sucking your blood, as they have to struggle a whole night just to get into your veins. Pity the mosquitoes which bite you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless? Oh, I get it! You are so heartless and shameless, your body weight would be lighter right? I\u2019m really jealous of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019re a cute, fascinating, hardworking mongrel, a new type of mongrel who is always serving the people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy equipment look ugly? Lemme take a look at yours, oh a bear suit huh? Animals would turn into humans with this equipment, while you become an animal when you wear it, huhu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Even with numbers, none could actually be an opponent to \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, the cuss words were mostly \u201cf***\u201d, \u201cc***\u201d, \u201cp****\u201d, as if they were running out of words. Until they could think of a fancy way to retort her, \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d was already in the arena. In contrast, \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d could mock them instantly without any vulgar or repetitive words, and even her chat bubble was longer than theirs. Not to mention the glamorous effects framing her chat bubble, she had spent almost thousands customizing her unique chat bubble frame to make it an eye-catching one. A rich player indeed.</p><br/><p>Since the others were not able to mock her alone, they felt like tearing \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d into pieces, but they were restricted in the safe zone, which rendered them angry and helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d was indeed a master of languages. Whenever this scene was read by readers in reality, they would immediately forget about her debut appearance of \u201cMary Sue\u201d, a decorative female character. Instead, they would be impressed by this \u201clanguage master\u201d who could make all the haters speechless. How awesome!</p><br/><p>In the same cyber cafe, Lin Feng\u2019s best pal, Tang Yongkai, was preparing to go into the arena for a solo battle. As his character \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d, was walking towards the arena, he saw the crowds were booing against \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, just to be countered and silenced by her in no time. Of course he had heard of \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, but he was unaware of the rumors about \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d. All he knew was that \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d was a liar, a ladyboy. It should be a truth as it was impossible for everyone to hate \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d right?</p><br/><p>Little did Tang Yongkai know that this was a true truth. It could not be helped though. \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u2019s\u201d chat bubbles were really despicable, and she had been looking down on people when she was simultaneously typing and fighting, yet no one had won her over!</p><br/><p>If one could win \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d in a fight, they could actually ignore whatever she said. That would just make her look like a child who just lost in a battle, and start spitting out those poisonous words. In reality, not only she had a gaming skill that surpassed almost everyone, yet with that unforgiving mouth of hers, she had made everyone who battled her felt really helpless\u2026</p><br/><p>Tang Yongkai was quite confident with his player skills in solo battle, as he was placed number 7 on the ranking board since he seldom played solo. What made him curious was that his leader Lin Feng, was not interested in PvP ranking at all.</p><br/><p>He would just light up a cigarette and smile, with nothing said. Tang Yongkai was unaware of Lin Feng\u2019s past in the professional arena, and the glorious results had Lin Feng had obtained in the one on one battle.</p><br/><p>Lin Feng had already lost the interest in solo battles long ago, simply because no one had ever won over him, especially during his prime\u2026 Now he even had the golden finger, which made him even stronger, so\u2026 who could possibly win him on a one on one battle?</p><br/><p>Lin Feng only sought to return to the professional arena, at the head of his own team, yielding no result lesser than victory in the finals, obtaining the title of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d. As for one-on-one battles, he only thought of it as children\u2019s play.</p><br/><p>Tang Yongkai had followed Yu Shengfan into the arena, and began his match in the one on one battle.</p><br/><p>Fate, was always amazing beyond words.</p><br/><p>Tang Yongkai\u2019s \u201cHoodlum Master\u201d was matched up against Yu Shengfan\u2019s \u201cUnpleasant Rain\u201d, which had made Tang Yongkai\u2019s blood boiling, \u201cBoss! Boss! Look who I got matched up with! \u2018Unpleasant Rain\u2019! I heard that he was a ladyboy liar, a fat otaku in reality!\u201d Tang Yongkai told Lin Feng</p>\n</div>"}

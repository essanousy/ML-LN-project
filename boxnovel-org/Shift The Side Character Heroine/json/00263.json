Those words came with no melody nor complete lyrics, but the live Douyu streamer, Ah Yu had sung the song like it was a daily good morning greeting. Not only was the music soothing to the ears, she had also filled up the missing lyrics as well. If this was an original composition of the female streamer, she was one of a kind!</p><br/><p>Rosemary, Ye Hai knew that Zhao Youyue was an extraordinary person for her musical talent, but little did he know that Zhao Youyue had the ability to enter the realm of a literary world, that was simply too absurd!</p><br/><p>He had grown to believe that Zhao Youyue had always been talented in music since young. Because she loved his book that much, she had taken the extra step to complete the song \u2013 \u201cSouth Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Youyue first sang the song \u201cSouth Mountain,\u201d she was using \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s card,\u201d that was why she was not able to sing the song perfectly. She felt that it was flawed and so she never sang it again.</p><br/><p>But things were different today; she had the \u201cChu Luoxun card.\u201d If she uses that iconic character card to sing \u201cSouth Mountain,\u201d the effects would be awesome!</p><br/><p>When \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d animation is officially on air, the audience would surely be conquered by her singing voice. In fact, the singing voice would not be carried out by Yu Shengfan, but by the talented musician, Chu Luoxun who was simply imitating Yu Shengfan.</p><br/><p>Once again, this had left Dong Yang highly impressed, and so he had Zhao Youyue sing the ending theme song for \u201cThe Strongest King,\u201d as the spot was still vacant.</p><br/><p>The opening theme song was sung by a male singer while a female sang the ending theme song.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Youyue agreed without hesitation. For a music lover like Chu Luoxun, she would gladly offer a helping hand when it comes to music.</p><br/><p>The animation crew of \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was happy to have Zhao Youyue on their side. They believed that Rosemary had great insight, he had found them an incredible cast member, and it had saved them a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was definitely the biggest surprise they have ever had in their lengthy professional careers!</p><br/><p>Dong Yang had also said that if Zhao Youyue ever intends to press on as voice actor, she would definitely climb to the top as one of the most successful voice actors ever. Her looks will only make it all the more easier.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Youyue knew herself too well, letting her voice the character she had possessed before was the key piece to all of this magic.</p><br/><p>She had already grown familiar with this literary world, especially when it came to the character, \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d She had almost spent her entire semester getting this awesome card; she knew everything about Chu Luoxun like the back of her hand!</p><br/><p>It would be difficult for her to voice for another character that she was not familiar with\u2026</p><br/><p>Her work progressed with great, fluid efficiency and she soon completed every line by the end of August. Her summer holiday was coming to an end, but she felt that this was the most fulfilling summer holiday she had ever had.</p><br/><p>During the process of recording, she had learned many other things; she could still activate her \u201cXu Jing card\u201d in her free time to indulge herself in learning.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had learned many things from the experienced and talented voice actor Song Gang, even though he had trouble socializing with the opposite gender that frightened him so. When he saw Zhao Youyue learning with enthusiasm, he was very pleased and glad to impart his knowledge in the field to her.</p><br/><p>In summary, her work at \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d was complete. If she ever stumbles upon the chance to voice act one of her \u201cwives\u201d again, the process would be smoother than ever. Her experience would only accumulate.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had earned her first paycheck with her own hands. An amateur would usually get paid between 500 to 700 per episode, but due to Zhao Youyue\u2019s outstanding performance, that value raised to 800. They also considered the fact that \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was a particularly talkative character, she would have a long list of lines per episode.</p><br/><p>Luckily \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d was killed off rather early; if she ever lived to see the finale of \u201cThe Strongest King,\u201d the voice actress for \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d would have a load in her hands!</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Shengfan\u201d appeared in 25 episodes, so Zhao Youyue\u2019s pay soon totaled up to 20,000RMB. That amount of money was tremendous, compared to an average high school student, and they could show it off by buying all sorts of things. To Lady Zhao who still had a few hundred thousand in her personal vault, this 20,000RMB was nothing to her.</p><br/><p>But it was meaningful to her; it proved that Lady Zhao Youyue could earn her own money without the help of her parents!</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhao Youyue was still earning some income through her Douyu live streaming channel, but it was not even close to ten thousand. She had almost forgotten about it, as it had little to no sense of presence at all.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Zhao Youyue\u2019s parents were not at home, or else she would have showed it off to her parents. But soon after that she hesitated, realizing that it would be difficult to explain the level of skill she displayed with Yu Shengfan\u2026</p><br/><p>After much consideration, Zhao Youyue decided to lay low; feeling that this small achievement did not justify for a bragging session. The real professionals would wait for others to uncover their exploits.</p><br/><p>The effects of showing off unintentionally would be much more significant.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not willing to become a side character at first, but she couldn\u2019t help it, as she had no special abilities of her own. She had always been uncertain of herself, trying to prove herself by stirring up negative attention.</p><br/><p>But now, after everything that she had been through, including the acquisition of a skill that nobody could learn, she realized that it is fine being a side character. She could always morph into the main character any time she chose, this was her true form!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue had just returned from the capital; she did not want to do anything at all, she just wanted to lay back and relax.</p><br/><p>To be honest, being able to obtain the iconic character card, Chu Luoxun, was an exciting event for Zhao Youyue. So when she gets the chance to use \u201cChu Luoxun card,\u201d she would not hesitate to use it. She wanted to show it off to the whole world.</p><br/><p>After she had inducted Goddess Chu into her harem, she could always draw attention to herself, be it by carrying out a violin performance at school or by singing the ending theme song for \u201cThe Strongest King.\u201d</p><br/><p>But in reality, for her to acquire the Goddess Chu card, the mental stress and suffering that she had to endure was all too intense, and she still had not yet recovered from it. So it was time to relax, and enjoy the little things in life.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue suddenly realized she was still short of a character card. This card would need the power of the \u201cSalted fish[1].\u201d It would have to be a character card specially made for relaxation. Upon activation, she would turn into a salted fish and relax, while being able to turn everything into an act of leisure\u2026</p><br/><p>As Zhao Youyue did not actually know how to enjoy herself fully, she only knew how to fiddle with her phone. That definitely could not ease the tension of her last \u201cdeath.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the deaths of \u201cXu Jing\u201d and \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d Zhao Youyue had experienced their deaths firsthand. \u201cXu Jing\u201d was less severe, as her death was never explained in detail, but \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was practically dead from the beginning of the book, and she had to suffer throughout a good half of the novel!</p><br/><p>If she does not shake this phobia off, the fear of death would prevent herself from working to acquire any other iconic cards.</p><br/><p>This is why she was keen on enjoying herself in the next literary world, no matter what\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator note:</p><br/><p>[1] Salted fish \u2013 It means a person who does nothing or slacking off a whole day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

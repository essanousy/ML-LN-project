She felt that Leng Zi had completely played her as a fool!</p><br/><p>She had been eagerly anticipating the ensembling of \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d and Guyuan due to the previous foreshadowing. It turned out that everything was a dream.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Qing still read it with great enthusiasm because the description was fascinating, even though it was the ensembling of Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue. Of course, Lin Meiyue was just a complement and Gu Yuan was the one who performed elegantly on the stage.</p><br/><p>This performance had profoundly changed Gu Yuan, utterly coming out from his trauma and moving on from his mother. This was a song that contained the love of a mother, and he delivered that kind of love to all of the audiences.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing admitted that this performance was also well-described by Leng Zi. Nevertheless, she noticed that it paled in comparison to the ensemble of the Goddess Chu and Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>This was not even an ensemble, but Gu Yuan\u2019s one-man show with Lin Meiyue merely following his tempo. Although there were no any highlights, there were no accidents too; everything was safe and smooth. All in all, it solidified her position as side character. The audiences even forgot that there was a violin accompaniment after listening to the \u201cLiebesleid\u201d</p><br/><p>Such irony made Jiang Qing, a hard-core fan of \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d miss the Goddess Chu badly. Only she would be able to start putting pressure on Gu Yuan when paired together!</p><br/><p>She wanted to know what was wrong with \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d and to know why she was absent.</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing continued reading. Finally, she felt Leng Zi\u2019 ill-will again. \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was sick and had been admitted to the hospital.</p><br/><p>She was shocked, sensing impending tragedy, and yet, the joyful writing style used by Leng Zi in describing the scene where the others visited her in the hospital left her inexplicably at ease.</p><br/><p>Anyway, as long as it was the plots of \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d it would put a smile on reader\u2019s faces. It could be a warm faint smile, or it could be a smile of amusement thanks to Goddess Chu\u2019s antics or, even, an understanding smile.</p><br/><p>In sum, she was a female character that brought boundless joy and humor to everybody.</p><br/><p>When the readers smiled, the \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d in the novel was smiling heartlessly too. She was being close to Lin Meiyue, and pretended to be strict on Gu Yuan, wanting him to treat Lin Meiyue nicely.</p><br/><p>Therefore, musical ability aside, the image of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d in Gu Yuan\u2019s heart was an aloof and easy-going girl with a brash demeanor similar to an enterprising woman. She was very independent and full of confidence in everything she did, as if nothing could ever stop her.</p><br/><p>She was also crazy about sweet food, never afraid of losing her perfect body figure.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan must admit that \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d indeed had a gorgeous face. Because of this, no matter how inappropriately she behaves, she will get away with it. This is the capricious benefit that a great beauty would have.</p><br/><p>For some guys, such a girl would be exceptionally charming, but as for Gu Yuan, he still preferred an unassuming girl like Lin Meiyueeven though she was not as beautiful as \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, such a Cancerous straight guy [1]. I don\u2019t know which part of the Goddess Chu fails to amaze you. Is she truly incomparable to Lin Meiyue?\u201d Jiang Qing murmured, expressing her resentment of Gu Yuan.</p><br/><p>However, she knew very well that she would also despise him if he changes his mind easily\u2014what a scumbag, changing his mind after seeing that \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d is prettier and more talented</p><br/><p>And so, such is the dilemma of quirky readers in this world. Unpredictable, unsure of their own desires, and constantly living in self-contradiction. Try as the author might, they will never be pleased!</p><br/><p>Thus, the author should not be bothered by them, and just write whatever they want. Without all these worries plaguing their minds, they would be able to produce better content.</p><br/><p>Soon, Jiang Qing began to worry again, as some words seemed to raise a flag!</p><br/><p>For instance, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d promised to have an ensemble with Gu Yuan again, but had failed to do so. Is there even a chance for them to have an ensemble, again?</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing was unsure about it. Previously, her spirits were raised when she saw \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d writing the \u201cSmells of Roses,\u201d thinking that it might be an unusual confession. It was just like the time when she told Gu Yuan that \u201cthe moonlight is beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>As \u201cSmells of Roses\u201d did not have a tune to go along with, only lyrics, so it lacked expression. If this song existed in reality, listening to it while reading this article would be so awesome!</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing did not stay worried for long, she was soon distracted by the dog food feeding between Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue.</p><br/><p>If every appearance of \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d is always full of laughter and life, then the perfect first love of Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue which was full of sweetness and warmth, gave off a sensation of love that was realistic yet \u2018borderline fantasical\u2019.</p><br/><p>Overall, it was a refreshing read. Both of them were still in the holding hands stage and had not yet kissed. Readers would not want to rush them either. Eating dog food was so good.</p><br/><p>Such delicious dog food was also the reason why the Lin Meiyue had a solid fanbase as well. Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue are doing fine, what is wrong with you all, Chu Luoxun fangirls. She does not have any feelings for Gu Yuan, what are you all being so delusional over?</p><br/><p>Was all this a lie?</p><br/><p>If so, this \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d is really great at deceiving people.</p><br/><p>Not only has she tricked the male protagonist and the heroine, but she also has most of the readers wrapped around her finger</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was not disgusting for Gu Yuan and Lin Meiyue to indulge in their affection when \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was sick. Everybody did not know that \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was severely sick!</p><br/><p>Han Leng\u2019s sense of timing was really excellent. He would quickly write a \u201cstable\u201d plot, which is very sweet and warm while the readers were worrying. It made them indulge in it, forgetting the plight of \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the other word, he was simply too cunning. The work was only halfway through, filled with light, cheerful writing, and all sorts of lamentations and terms used only gave people more joy. It could almost be categorized as a comedy novel!</p><br/><p>Then, Jiang Qing, who had completely submerged herself sweetness, suddenly felt the sharp pain of a blade in her heart!</p><br/><p>At one moment, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was happily humming \u201cSweet,\u201d and promptly collapsed. Both her legs have lost all form of sensation</p><br/><p>Jiang Qing was stunned. This is no fake \u201cApril\u201d!</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Cancerous straight guy is an internet slang used to describe a man who is living in his own worldview, value system, and aesthetic standards. Also used as a disparaging term for a male chauvinist. Normally, such individuals are very self-righteous and ignore the value of women, objectifying them.</p>\n</div>"}

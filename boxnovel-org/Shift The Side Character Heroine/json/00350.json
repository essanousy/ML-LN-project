But soon, he was immersed in the sound of the piano. He seemed to listen more attentively than the others. It appeared that he had the most attainments in classical music among all the others present.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue, or rather, Chu Luoxun\u2019s \u2018Spiritual music\u2019 characteristic, sent even ordinary laymen into a daze, even if she performs the most technical, drone-like pieces. Even so, professional musicians would be able to understand such beauty in a more profound manner.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian was embarrassed by the turn of events. To him, getting embarrassed and making a fool of himself in such an occasion, was a bargain in exchange of enjoying such perfect music, while appreciating an even more perfect girl.</p><br/><p>After the song ended, Shi Jingnian was the first to applaud. Even so, he still seemed to be holding himself back, unlike the others who went crazy, displaying a sharp contrast between them. Some already could not help approaching towards Zhao Youyue to praise her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue responded cheerfully and generously to these people who had been influenced by her music when she was still in her \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s possession\u201d mode. Even Ding Yuncong could not help approaching her and said solemnly, \u201cMiss Zhao Youyue, your music made me see the beauty of classical music for the first time ever in my life. Thank you very much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue flashed a brilliant smile. This was precisely Chu Luoxun\u2019s heart\u2019s desire, no matter what world she was in. She hoped to bring happiness to more people through her music, showing them the beauty of music, no matter the genre or instrument.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, you would get a firmer grasp if you listened to such a symphony in a concert hall. Such effects would only appear during live performances,\u201d Zhao Youyue explained.</p><br/><p>However, Ding Yuncong was unconvinced. He felt that no music at any concert hall could be compared to what Zhao Youyue just played. His eyes and ears had thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Her fingers working their rapid magic on the piano keys had been truly mesmerizing.</p><br/><p>As per everyone else\u2019s unanimous request, Zhao Youyue played another Chu Luoxun\u2019s original piano piece. It wasn\u2019t as dazzling, but it resonated closer to the heart. But it was as if the music had turned into a motherly figure caressing all her \u201cchildren\u201d who were present with love and tenderness</p><br/><p>After the performance of the two piano pieces, all the guests present had been utterly conquered by Zhao Youyue\u2019s music. With envy, jealousy, and hate, Ding Yuncong hissed at Zhao Hao, \u201cWhy did you have such an excellent sister? Wouldn\u2019t it be extremely great to be able to listen to her music every single day?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ding Yuncong lose his composure, Zhao Hao was utterly satisfied. His sister Zhao Youyue had given his reputation a huge boost. He replied proudly, \u201cShe still live streams. You should drop by more often.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong replied, \u201cHow would live streaming replicate this scene I\u2019ve just taken with my own senses? How about this? What if I call her my sister as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost! How old are you? Still aiming for young girls? How shameless are you!\u201d Zhao Hao refused decisively. He treasured her sister Youyue very much.</p><br/><p>Ding Yuncong immediately explained, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. She\u2019s the little princess of your Zhao family. How will I dare to have any other thoughts? I simply want a new sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are actually still people like you who want to steal the \u2018brother\u2019s\u2019 position! But my answer is still \u2018NO.\u2019 I am her one and only brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPttttf, I didn\u2019t expect you to be so stingy, Zhao Ritian. I\u2019m too lazy to bother you. I\u2019ll go please her directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s successful performance made everyone forget about Shi Jingnian. Yet, Shi Jingnian remained unruffled, as if he possessed no self-esteem at all. He remained as calm as ever. He started eating watermelons by himself.</p><br/><p>However, his girlfriend, Lin Shiya said longingly, \u201cThat Lady Zhao is simply too amazing. It\u2019s my first time meeting such a perfect girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my eyes, you\u2019re the most perfect one there is.\u201d Shi Jingnian smiled warmly, and fed her a piece of cantaloupe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always had such a thick face. That sounded so disgusting sweet!\u201d Although Lin Shiya said so, her actions proved otherwise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019re her piano skills, compared to yours?\u201d Lin Shiya asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s definitely way better than me, to be able to please so many people!\u201d Shi Jingnian replied as if he knew nothing about pride and self-esteem. \u201cBut there\u2019s one that she can never match me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Lin Shiya asked, curious. This boyfriend who she dearly loved had always been able to give her an endless string of surprises.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy piano will only be played for you,\u201d Shi Jingnian lightly caressed Lin Shiya\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Lin Shiya\u2019s face turned red again. She smacked him in the chest. Her heart was twisted up in knots, yet her mouth said, \u201cYou\u2019re also weird. You are extremely talented, yet you dislike showing your talent in front of others. You choose to shut the door and use your talent for self-entertainment. Are you sick? Not only in music, but also in literature.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian gave her a serious reply, \u201cI am really sick. A sickness that will kill me the moment I leave you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlib-tongued!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the washroom. I\u2019m risking my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Shi Jingnian came out from the washroom, he happened to notice Zhao Youyue washing her hands with hand sanitizer. He looked at the Zhao Youyue in the mirror, and he sighed. This Lady was truly beautiful. Her temperament was even more perfect. Her current outfit was already enough to send many guys retreating, thinking that she was way out of their leagues.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian obviously realized this as well. Yet, he still could not help saying, \u201cA Lady is indeed a Lady, being so exquisite, even when washing hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if Zhao Youyue had used up all her smiles when she switched on the \u201cChu Luoxun card.\u201d With a stern face that exuded a rare coldness and arrogance that repelled people thousands of miles away, she said calmly, \u201cYou\u2019ve intended to catch my attention through that kind of clumsy trick from the very beginning, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a rhetorical statement, not a question. She made it clear that she had already seen through everything.</p><br/><p>Shi Jingnian still had a smile on his handsome face. He replied gently, \u201cThis is your true side, am I right? How meaningless it is to put on a mask. I feel that you look way better with your cold face, as if you see no person in your sight, rather than you smiling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re truly bumptious,\u201d Zhao Youyue replied coldly. She considered this guy to be very dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I dare? I\u2019m just simply saying. Please don\u2019t take my words seriously. Actually, my biggest hobby is to hope that pretty girls like you would live freely and happily. You\u2019re so perfect. I can even imagine what you must have suffered early in your life,\u201d Shi Jingnian replied sincerely.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue smiled, thinking, \u201cYou know nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>But within her heart, she raised her guard up even further. This guy was truly a pick-up master. If she was truly a Lady who had faced all sorts of oppression since young, she might have really fallen for those words, and then step by step\u2026</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, she was a passerby character in the past. Such a character probably would never meet a character who flowed with the protagonist\u2019s aura like Shi Jingnian.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

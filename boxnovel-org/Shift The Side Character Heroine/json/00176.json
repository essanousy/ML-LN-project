The prelude is melancholic; the rhythm is full of charm and sway. The entire song gave off a very Latino vibe\u2026</p><br/><p>It was rather nice to listen to, as long as the ears can take a syncopation that constantly beats.</p><br/><p>Actually, the author, Leng Zi did not have any knowledge concerning classical music, but fortunately, his literary work now housed a troublemaker girl who knew what he did. He did not have to research on information for classical music, all he had to do was to let his pen run free in this \u201coutburst of inspiration\u201d.</p><br/><p>At any rate, every author would want a troublemaker like Zhao Youyue in their literary work, in hopes that she would lessen the burden of creating new content\u2026</p><br/><p>As the piano started to play, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d also started to play her violin elegantly. Her movement was precise and beautiful, she closed her eyes, putting all of her soul into playing the violin\u2026</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan felt cold sweat dribbling down his chin, but he was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, this is going smoothly, I can still hear myself playing the piano, luckily it was this particular song!\u201d Gu Yuan murmured.</p><br/><p>Even though he would trip over a note or two, as long as he pays attention to the violin and music score, he would go through this without any trouble\u2026 This was not a technically demanding song.</p><br/><p>The stage was set!</p><br/><p>It was going on smoothly, until\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was sitting among the audience, looking at Gu Yuan who had decided to play the piano again, she smiled. At the same time, she was a little bit disappointed with herself because she wished that she had the skills of Chu Luoxun, so she would be qualified to perform together with the genius pianist, Gu Yuan\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue wanted to learn more from \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d because she was the girl Lin Meiyue admired.</p><br/><p>The judge who had his eyes on Chu Luoxun was frowning, \u201cThe difference with the last performance was too great, is she behaving herself because she was cooperating with Gu Yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when the judge had the thought, Chu Luoxun winked at Gu Yuan and started to improvise wildly without following the music score, diverting from the original piece\u2026</p><br/><p>The judge can\u2019t help himself but smile at her, \u201cSo you have finally revealed yourself, little girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience became absorbed in her music!</p><br/><p>There were many bright faces of enjoyment among the crowd, as if this was no longer a music competition, but a musical performance!</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan\u2019s best friend, Chen Hao was here as well, as he stared at the brilliant star, \u201cChu Luoxun.\u201d Even an introvert like him couldn\u2019t help himself but say, \u201cShe\u2019s really awesome and beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Hao did not know of any classical music; if it not for his best friend, Gu Yuan, he would have never paid attention to classical music whatsoever. His only interest would be getting involved in studying to improve his grades; he had even sacrificed the prospect of romance, even though he heard from Lin Meiyue that \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d had a crush on him\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, his heart was beating in tandem with her lively music!</p><br/><p>Chen Hao starts to fantasize if she still has feelings for him after he graduated, surely he would accept her. But now, he chooses to focus on his studies even though he had a crush on her now.</p><br/><p>Everything was going accordingly to plan, until the music arrived at the \u201cRondo\u201d part\u2026</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan suddenly saw a familiar face among the crowd, smiling at him hideously, it was his dead mother!</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, he was hallucinating. Just as the music was about to hit the climax, his \u201ctrauma\u201d made its appearance once again!</p><br/><p>The music notes start to shatter into pieces right in front of Gu Yuan, blurring his vision!</p><br/><p>The musical notes were disappearing and disintegrating\u2026</p><br/><p>It was as if Gu Yuan had sunken into the deep sea, along with his piano!</p><br/><p>He could no longer hear the sound of the piano!</p><br/><p>Under such circumstance, his rhythm fell apart into a wreck!</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What happened?\u201d The judge who had favored Chu Luoxun frowned, \u201cHer accompaniment\u2019s rhythm who has always been loyal to the score is going haywire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 Her partner\u2019s rhythm is a mess!\u201d The other judge said.</p><br/><p>The audience was roused from their stupor by this messy rhythm, as if they had been forcefully kicked out of a good dream, they all had dissatisfied looks on their face, it felt like premature ejaculation before foreplay\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Meiyue was worried sick about Gu Yuan; her entire heart was agitated.</p><br/><p>Chu Luoxun had opened her eyes too, her forehead was drenched in sweat, she frowned, not because she was worried about her performance was getting messed up, but she was worried about Gu Yuan as well. It looks like it would not be an easy task to save Gu Yuan from this bottomless abyss.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan bit down on his teeth, a nervous wreck. He felt as if he was at the bottom of the dark ocean, unknown to sight, nor known to sound, alone in the darkness. It was dark, and lonely, sinking into the bottom of the ocean alone.</p><br/><p>The audience was starting to complain</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s playing the piano, right? What sort of accompaniment is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer partner\u2019s just terrible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI liked the violin, but this pianist has completely messed up her performance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be even better without her partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The judge who liked \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d also shook his head, \u201cTheir cooperation was a little bit out of practice but manageable. Now, Gu Yuan\u2019s piano is destroying the performance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, damn, damn! I\u2019m hitting all these keys on the piano, but why can\u2019t I hear any sound from my piano!</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan\u2019s mentality had collapsed entirely!</p><br/><p>He gave up playing the piano halfway because he knew if he continued to play the piano, he would only ruin the violinist\u2019s, \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d performance\u2026</p><br/><p>The judge muttered to himself, \u201cWise choice, even though her points won\u2019t remain unscathed from this, playing it further would only intensify the damage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pianist was terrible; he shouldn\u2019t even have started playing in the first place!\u201d Some audience members were angry, because they had completely fallen into \u201cChu Luoxun\u2019s\u201d violin performance!</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan can only lower his head, blaming himself endlessly\u2026</p><br/><p>But then, \u201cChu Luoxun\u201d also made a huge mistake, she stopped playing her nearly perfect violin performance!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the whole theater was in a commotion!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s one thing in a music competition that contestant should never do, that is to stop midway during a performance. No matter what the circumstances are, they would undoubtedly get knocked out, when they end their performance prematurely. Even though the judge who favored \u201cChu Luoxun,\u201d was forced to give an \u201cX\u201d to her.</p><br/><p>Many of the audiences were blaming on the pianist; the violinist was great on her own, she should not even have a partner!</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Luoxun\u201d was already drenched in sweat, and sighed. Even though she was already exhausted, and at the limit of her body, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain!\u201d Chu Luoxun looked at Gu Yuan, under the spotlight, she still looked as brilliant as ever, and with the dazzling smile on her face, it was as if she had not been affected by all the commotion!</p><br/><p>Maybe it is an endless road in front of me, but still, I choose to march forward. Even the smallest start will pave the way for my journey!</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s continue.</p>\n</div>"}

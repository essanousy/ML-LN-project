Nothing much, it just had this indescribable burning passion within!</p><br/><p>The literary work, \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d had a very big influence, mainly due to \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s\u201d appearance, as this character had been created in a beautiful way. Besides the main character, the following character who gave another deep impression was none other than Yu Shengfan herself.</p><br/><p>Readers who have read it would felt that she did give out a very deep impression.</p><br/><p>Yu Shengfan\u2019s terrifying reflexes was way beyond the limits of any ordinary person. Only she had the ability to control her character while mocking her opponent at the same time. Too bad \u201cLoL\u201d was different compared to \u201cEternal War\u201d, as words displayed on the public chat could be hidden. This had actually made Yu Shengfan\u2019s \u201cChat Flow\u201d to become useless, as she could not show off her spectacular chat bubbles in \u201cLoL\u201d. At most, she could only make her champion \u201cdance\u201d to taunt her opponent</p><br/><p>Every single word of \u201cYu Shengfan\u2019s Vicious Quotes\u201d, made her sense of presence went way off the chart, on the other hand Rosemary\u2019s reputation increased because of it. Readers thought that he fully demonstrated his writing skills on Yu Shengfan\u2019s venomous phrases, what a language master he was. Perhaps because of those venomous phrases were not considered as a vulgar language, but a form of language arts.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Purple\u201d, the lady streamer had never read \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d, so the words appeared in the pop-ups made her confused, but that did not stop her from becoming a fan of \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d because his earlier performances were simply awesome!</p><br/><p>Especially Yasuo the Unforgiven, those reflexes, and elegance, were simply indescribable with words. She even had the misconception that the player had become one with Yasuo, and that was why he was able to use that champion skillfully</p><br/><p>As the witness of this solo match, \u201cMiss Purple\u201d announced the final winner \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d, and asked \u201cJungling King\u201d to pay his wages.</p><br/><p>She then took the initiative to add \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d as her friend in the meantime. All she wanted was to get along with this High God, so that he could bring up her rankings</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the player controlling \u201cJungling King\u201d had swapped back into Feng Ming. His best friend, Cao Jinglong had this \u201ccompletely lost\u201d facial expression and not to mention, his mentality was completely shattered as well!</p><br/><p>Zed, the master of shadows was his strongest champion, yet he got beaten up so badly that he began to doubt his life. His opponent still teased him right from the start till the end of the match! All those dreams of becoming a professional player had suddenly turned into something unachievable!</p><br/><p>Cao Jinglong knew that his opponent had a substitute player, or even a professional player. His initial thoughts regarding professional players were none other than gaining certain standards, so that he could eventually become a professional mid lane player within a famous team. But after being defeated by \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d, he had this sudden thought that gaming was meaningless. That\u2019s right, with the existence of this freak, where were all the meanings of playing games?</p><br/><p>Gaming was all about winning, but when Cao Jinglong faced his opponent, in despair, he realized he could not win no matter what!</p><br/><p>Besides, his opponent was able to show off his extreme skills, while leisuring around typing and taunting him, in fact, this very much indicated that his opponent did not show his true powers!</p><br/><p>So, is there any meaning left in gaming!?</p><br/><p>Feng Ming did not have that 1,000 QQ coins, so he quitted the game without much consideration. He did not have the courage to ridicule his opponent either, simply because he was unable to pay, and had to call \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d daddy.</p><br/><p>Feng Ming had no guts to even look at the broadcasting room. By now, he knew he would be criticized by those pop-ups crazily. Even though he was badly criticized, he was not going to fulfill his promise to pay that 1,000 QQ coins, which was equivalent to 1,000 RMB. He would not even hand in his own money if his best friend\u2019s car had overturned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Long, your opponent is really that strong? I feel like you were totally overwhelmed in last two rounds\u201d Said Feng Ming. He was not going to blame Cao Jinglong since he had always relied on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s way too strong, can\u2019t you see he could type and taunt at the same time? What does this even imply? It means that his skills are much better than mine, I can sense that he was full of confidence, and even felt his aura of not losing to anyone in a solo match. I was totally overwhelmed in terms of strength and power\u201d</p><br/><p>While Cao Jinglong mentioned it, he recalled the words, \u201cThree Dimensional Yu Shengfan\u201d, \u201cUnpleasant Night Rain Rhythm, The Sword Set the World Alight\u201d in the pop-ups from the broadcasting room. He could not help but to look up those terms in Baidu, and found a novel, \u201cThe Strongest King\u201d. He began reading it out of curiosity, and could not control himself later on!</p><br/><p>The novel was great and the character Yu Shengfan was interesting! Wait, so\u2026 the substitute player for \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d was \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d? He would gladly accept it if he was ever defeated by Yu Shengfan in reality, as she was a super gaming genius, even the main protagonist Lin Feng was envious of her insane gaming talents</p><br/><p>No!</p><br/><p>There was no way in reality that a bug[1] player like Yu Shengfan would have existed, obviously the opponent was just imitating her!</p><br/><p>Cao Jinglong snapped out of it, and realized that reading novels were way more interesting than gaming. Hmm.. might as well write a novel of his own, so that he could imagine himself as an invincible person, and not the one who was being defeated in the gaming realm</p><br/><p>The showdown was put to an end.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao sat in front of his computer again, and rejected the friend request of that internet famous lady streamer that admired him. If it was not because of her encouragement, he would not be in that situation. Fortunately for him, he had a secret weapon, and was saved by his super High God little sister, or else he would end up in an embarrassing situation.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, to Zhao Hao, 1,000 RMB was nothing! All he cared was his reputation. Whoever messed him up would get a taste of their own medicine.</p><br/><p>Of course, whoever made his reputation increased, he would be pleased with that person. In fact, he was already pleased with Zhao Youyue, but for now, he could only think of his little cousin as an amazing person! He did not expect her to be an expert in \u201cLoL\u201d, even though she did mention that she only knew a little of it earlier on</p><br/><p>Maybe this was the attitude of a real High God, truly a modest one.</p><br/><p>\u201cYouyue Meimei, you played so well just like Yu Shengfan from \u2018The Strongest King\u2019, are you interested in playing professional?\u201d Zhao Hao asked in a serious way.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Feng was not in your team, what\u2019s the point of playing professionally?\u201d Zhao Youyue deactivated her \u201cYu Shengfan\u201d mode right after she gave her reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at that broken team of yours, just give it a break! Xiao Youyue has just entered high school not long ago, for her, learning is more important, don\u2019t ruin her studies, you useless brother!\u201d Zhang Wanjun added from the side.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao smiled awkwardly, and never mentioned it again. He just thought that, \u201cEven when you are skilled in gaming, you could only make it this far, that\u2019s it.\u201d This little sister of his was now part of the Zhao\u2019s family, a real noble person.</p><br/><p>Then, the three of them left the cyber cafe and went on for movies, but the internet was full of the name \u201cF*cking Demon King\u201d due to his spectacular solo matches.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>1. Bug \u2013 It used to describe a cheater or overpowered character in gaming term.</p>\n</div>"}

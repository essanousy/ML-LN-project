On that particular day, the world was aquatic in nature. It was a world under the sea. An octopus-like creature had pioneered its civilization.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue felt that she had traveled into an alien planet. This was something that she would never be able to achieve in reality. Now, she was realizing it through the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The work \u201cWhite Clover\u201d might not be able to give her any ability, as it was not very popular, and most readers disliked it. However, as the heroine of this Doujinshi novel, Zhao Youyue was having a wonderful time within its literary worlds.</p><br/><p>It was like enjoying a one-time, free of charge, grand trip, without even needing to look out for herself, as this \u201cAltair,\u201d with her maxed out \u2018Mystery\u2019 attribute was almost invincible.</p><br/><p>However, just as she was beginning to fall in stride and enjoy herself, the oceanic world around her started collapsing in the most extravagant display of visual effects!</p><br/><p>The literary world of \u201cWhite Clover\u201d collapsed, right after its \u201cGod\u201d died.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could not place the scene in words. It was just too overwhelming, too awe-inspiring. She started feeling that she was no longer within the literary world, but in the real world.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not make her exit at that point. She had not yet known that the work\u2019s author, \u201cSetsuna\u201d had died. She thought that it was just another insight to this creator\u2019s brilliant mind.</p><br/><p>But then, she found herself standing in an urban, Terran world. It gave Zhao Youyue such a sense of familiarity, as if this was not one of those imaginary literary worlds, but one that was similar to the real world where her actual body was, a world that was as tangible as herself.</p><br/><p>Before she could regain her bearings, she further realized that the \u2018strings\u2019 of the \u2018marionette\u2019 had left her altogether. Usually, when she possesses \u201cAltair,\u201d she would feel a mysterious force guiding her actions. In those cases, she just had to walk accordingly to the plotline laid out by the writer. She only needed to \u2018lay down,\u2019 since the writer was the one pushing her forward. She would be \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d\u2018marionette.\u2019</p><br/><p>But now, she realized that if she did not move at all, \u201cAltair\u201d would not move as well\u2026</p><br/><p>She now had total control over the actions of this body.</p><br/><p>Then, through that world\u2019s internet, Zhao Youyue realized that \u201cAltair\u201d was rather popular. But her nature would always a re-created fanmade character derived from its origin \u201cShirotsumekusa,\u201d which appeared within the social game \u201cEternal Wars Megalosphere\u201d[1]. She first appeared within Shimazaki Setsuna\u2019s created video \u201cWorld ?tude\u201d[2].</p><br/><p>What the hell is \u201cEternal Wars Megalosphere\u201d?</p><br/><p>Who the hell is Shimazaki Setsuna? Is she that \u201cSetsuna\u201d? \u201cSetsuna\u201d was supposed to be a Chinese!</p><br/><p>Why the hell was this world conversing in Japanese?</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue jumped to the first assumption in her mind. This might not be the real world at all, but a world within a Japanese anime.</p><br/><p>This anime might be an iconic work within another parallel world.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not immediately exercise her newfound freedom. She only wanted to know what happened to the Doujinshi novel, \u201cWhite Clover,\u201d and its writer \u201cSetsuna,\u201d more than ever.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this unprecedented situation had not trapped her within this world. However, when she returned to her actual body, she noticed that the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d was in a cooldown state once again, and that she no longer had access to \u201cWhite Clover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even so, a character card of the princess with military uniform appeared in the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d Zhao Youyue almost screamed out of excitement. Was this an actual \u201csleeping victory?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Youyue did not know how powerful this military uniform princess \u201cAltair\u201d was, but when the world was destroyed, she found herself able to travel through dimensions and enter new worlds at will. If she was truly able to use such an inter-dimensional traveling ability, wouldn\u2019t this mean that she would be able to travel to thousands of worlds?</p><br/><p>Also, she had a maxed-out \u2018Mystery\u2019 attribute. This attribute implied that she had endless trump cards. No one would ever figure her out. She would come up with more and more tricks that guarantee her victory, even when all else suggested that it was over for her</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue took a closer look, and noticed the character card \u201cAltair\u201d was greyed-out, and the name actually said, \u201cAltair (incomplete).\u201d Her excitement died out. What was going on here?</p><br/><p>Was there no such thing as a \u2018sleeping victory,\u2019 after all?</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, this character card had actually appeared on the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d Even though it was still greyed out, this meant that Zhao Youyue might still be able to access her, one day!</p><br/><p>In other words, this military uniform princess was already one of Zhao Youyue\u2019s reserve harem players.</p><br/><p>However, to obtain this military uniform princess, Zhao Youyue would have to expand her influence, or even to use her identity to get involved</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue might have to move heaven and earth itself, to acquire this nigh-invincible iconic character card.</p><br/><p>Some iconic character cards could never be obtained by just experiencing one literary world. This applied even more so to Altair. She was already one-of-a-kind, to begin with \u2014\u2014 She was a re-created fanmade character. Many other writers could pick her up and continue her story.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue started communicating with the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d She wanted to know what had happened. After all, her exit this time was truly baffling.</p><br/><p>Then, she received message from the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate.\u201d The Doujinshi novel \u201cWhite Clover\u201d was incomplete!</p><br/><p>Of course, the \u201cTwo Dimensional Gate\u201d would not tell Zhao Youyue why this form of \u2018incompletion\u2019 seemed to have been set in stone. After all, the writer had died of illness. How could she possibly continue writing?</p><br/><p>Yet, Zhao Youyue believed this to be the far more common form of incompletion. She assumed that \u201cSetsuna\u201d had totally given up upon this work. After realizing that the popular fanmade anime video had been unable to make her novel popular, she would naturally feel disheartened and give up on writing the novel\u2026</p><br/><p>Abandoning a piece of work was truly a scary thing. Zhao Youyue could never forget the apocalyptical moment the oceanic world within the literary world of \u201cWhite Clover\u201d went through. How frightening it had been!</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could not help but send a message to ask about \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d condition, but she did not receive any response.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue suddenly felt like one of those girls who had been tossed away by those playboys after they had their fun. Irresponsible authors were truly hateful, and they seemed to be far more prevalent than ever this year!</p><br/><p>Not long after, Zhao Youyue received a reply from a family member of \u201cSetsuna\u2019s,\u201d saying that \u201cSetsuna\u201d had succumbed to cancer.</p><br/><p>The new post, without clarifying if it had been written by \u201cSetsuna\u2019s\u201d mother or father, explained the situation of her death.</p><br/><p>The fanmade video \u201cAltair: Divina Commedia\u201d was still riding upon the waves of fame. Its script\u2019s original author \u201cSetsuna\u201d was still a hot topic, yet she had ended up dead!</p><br/><p>This news quickly spread throughout the internet, within the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Translation Note:</p><br/><p>[1] Eternal Wars Megalosphere \u2013 In the premise of the anime RE:Creators, the main villainess Altair is an (in-universe) fan-made derivation of a character named Shirotsumekusa, from the social game Eternal Wars Megalosphere.</p><br/><p>[2] World ?tude \u2013 a.k.a. \u201cWorld Etude\u201d, an OST of the anime \u201cRe:Creators.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

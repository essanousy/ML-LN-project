It sounded like a gender-neutral name. People who have never seen her might assume her as male from the name alone.</p><br/><p>There was no helping it. Professor Chen\u2019s work would always be laden with heavy sci-fi elements. It often left readers baffled but impressed. Of course, such faux-science would never fool the real experts. However, there was more than enough clueless outsiders to go around the world. Some diehard fans would treat the fabricated faux-technology in Professor Chen\u2019s work like the real thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Admittedly, Professor Chen\u2019s writing style took itself way too seriously. Who knows, she might be firmly convinced that her very own dark technology was the real thing as she got absorbed in writing. Having lost herself in those thoughts, she would introduce the technology in a dissertation paper. Readers would no doubt be impressed at the level of detail, even if they knew better than to believe it.</p><br/><p>Master PhD, otherwise known as Professor Chen, was not very difficult to approach. Lady Zhao was basically the God of Tycoons in the web novel circle. Her reach knew no bounds. Even the most badass High God would have to give her face.</p><br/><p>This had nothing to do with how Zhao Youyue randomly gave out Silver Sect or Golden Sect Masters. It was all about her wide range of contacts. If an author intended to market his work, how could he do it without any connections?</p><br/><p>Perhaps the average web novelist would remain unaware about Zhao Youyue\u2019s identity. They would probably assume that she was a regular God of Tycoon or a bot account. High God authors who wanted some exposure would contact this bot account. It was probably the face of a marketing company. Either way, it could increase their reward points or promote their works in the site.</p><br/><p>However, the actual High God level-ranked web novelists all knew that \u201cTycoon Youyue\u2019s\u201d full name was Zhao Youyue. Everyone would respectfully address her as the \u2018Missy.\u2019 As for this Missy\u2019s identity, it\u2019s best you don\u2019t dig into it if you\u2019re the type to get jealous. Zhao Youyue was most probably the only person that the rich tycoon boy Ding Yuncong would joke about being her chauffeur.</p><br/><p>It may just be a flippant joke, but based on his words, one could see how highly he regarded the Lady.</p><br/><p>Additionally, there was also the similarly famous Zhao Hao. He was even more handsome than Ding Yuncong, albeit lacking slightly in height. He definitely did not lose out in terms of wealth. In other aspects, he actually surpassed Ding Yuncong.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao and Zhao Youyue were related by blood. It was natural for him to pamper her. If anything, he was firmly convinced that everything he said about her was watered down. He had the ultimate say concerning investment projects about his sister. Perhaps due to the groundbreaking success of the \u201cBeautiful April\u201d film adaptation, his words now carried far more weight.</p><br/><p>Zhao Hao had already regarded his sister as a treasure. He did not have the talent to match up to his sister, but he could definitely provide her the stage to showcase hers. Either way, it was a good thing, whether it was his sister, him, or even the entire Zhao family.</p><br/><p>All in all, the High God authors who were in the loop about Lady Zhao\u2019s highly impressive background had also polished their bootlicking skills. Even those who did not practice that would at least show some her some respect. A personal invitation from the divine would never take no for an answer.</p><br/><p>As an ancient High God, Professor Chen still remained in contact with the numerous famous authors who had started with her in the beginning. It was how Zhao Youyue got in touch with this elusive professor. It was time to smoke her out\u2026</p><br/><p>That was when she found that Professor Chen was actually pursuing her Doctorate in Jiangnan University!</p><br/><p>Master PhD might even be Zhao Youyue\u2019s senior!</p><br/><p>Nobody would ever believe where Tycoon Youyue and Master PhD first met in person. It was Jiangnan University\u2019s \u2018White House,\u2019 or in other words, the Student Council President\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Prior to the meeting, Zhao Youyue had attempted to paint a picture to the pen-name, \u201cMaster PhD.\u201d How would a Master PhD look like? Would she be sporting a long, white lab coat with high-powered glasses on a cold, poker face? Would she look like a mad scientist?</p><br/><p>When she met Professor Chen, that image had shattered into a million pieces.</p><br/><p>Professor Chen was petite, barely standing over 150cm. She was sweet, cute and did not have any glasses on\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Chen revealed a slightly embarrassed smile. Her loli voice that matched her body squeaked out, \u201cHow are you, Ms. President.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue could not believe that this Professor Chen was already 28 years old. She was already close to graduation.</p><br/><p>Professor Chen started writing web novels when she was 15 years old. That was 13 years ago. At that time, web novels were just emerging. Compared to the current state of affairs, it had only been the tiniest speck at the center of a quark\u2026</p><br/><p>The web novelists who debuted around the same time as Professor Chen would never have expected this fellow pioneer to actually be a cute legal loli who even knew how to play a part.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Professor Chen\u2019s \u201ca guy\u2019s promise\u201d was utter hogwash. So was her typical wager of how \u201cif you\u2019re not able to fulfill the promise, then wear women\u2019s clothing.\u201d She was already in women\u2019s clothing, and not just any women\u2019s clothing, but the super cute, pink fluffy type.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue returned Chen Chen\u2019s greetings and addressed her as \u2018Master PhD.\u2019 Professor Chen blushed. \u201cDon\u2019t call me Master PhD. It sounds like you\u2019re calling me a child with a big butt [1]. Just call me \u2018Professor Chen.\u2019 I prefer the title \u2018professor.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Chen was proud of her identity as a female professor. No matter how you look at it, a Sociology certification from the world famous Jiangnan University was highly respectable.</p><br/><p>However, some men in this world would still look down on female professors. Ladies belonged to the third species. It was most probably a defense-mechanism that over-compensated for the male sense of inferiority, when in the presence of an alpha female.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. How are you, Professor Chen? I really did not expect to find a High God like you to have hidden in Jiangnan University. You\u2019re actually my senior! This feels so surreal!\u201d Zhao Youyue said rather sincerely.</p><br/><p>Professor Chen was clearly not that type of slow-witted person who knew nothing about socializing. She quickly stepped into the \u2018you flatter me \u2014 I flatter you\u2019 game. \u201cIt\u2019s natural for me to slip past your divine gaze. But I do know you. You ran for the Student Council Elections, and I actually voted for you! I really like Hua Chenyu. Do you think you can get him to sing at Jiangnan University?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was not the type who idolized celebrities. They weren\u2019t really that special to her. She could even command any single one of them to take her out on a date. However, she kept herself in the loop. This was why when she heard about Professor Chen\u2019s half-joking request, she accepted it without blinking, which left the Professor floored.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao widened her smile \u201cProfessor Chen, let\u2019s talk about your new book \u201cEndless Apocalypse\u201d \u2026 That smile only made her more beautiful than ever, but at the same time, she looked like a beast that was just revealing its fangs.</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cchild with a big butt\u201d () This is actually a pun on the author\u2019s name. The Pinyin of the author\u2019s name \u201cPi Da\u201d (p) has another meaning, which is \u201cbig butt\u201d.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Enraged, the director had decided to film the whole script, the script that he wrote when he was as inspired as he was drunk, so that it would make it to the news!</p><br/><p>Since the war film I created was \u2018boring\u2019 and those blasted viewers never once gave it a good rating, screw it all, I\u2019ll just go loco here these were the thoughts of the director.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Jiayi snapped out of his shock, he complained, \u201cWhat is this director on? He created something so ridiculous, this must be some kind of joke, this is an insult to all war films! How blasphemous\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, such things exist! I don\u2019t mind it at all, I find it rather quite interesting. Even though I\u2019ve never seen the previous episodes, but now even I feel like watching the past episodes to understand the plot better. War films these days are too solemn and serious\u2026\u201d Wang Hua refuted her husband.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Too solemn and serious? Blood is spilled in wars, it\u2019s not like you expect everyone to sing along at campfires!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that will still be boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just continue watching, shall we?\u201d Zhao Youyue piped up, she certainly did not want to see her mom and dad quarrel again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat reminds me, Youyou. You knew that this director was going to do something, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Zhao Jiayi felt suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmhmm, but I never expected that he would do something like this, this war film is certainly mystical.\u201d Zhao Youyue chuckled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi did not bother probing any further. She probably had her sources, or knew an extra in the cast.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi knew that his daughter was good at socializing with other people, even though she was just ordinary in every aspect. She could blend in very well, and people would easily connect to her, and would easily pull her into their circles.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi knew his daughter like the back of his hand. Now that Zhao Youyue had blended into the field of network literature and manga, she has become a famous reader. She would receive numerous invitations to fan gatherings of well-known authors, but unfortunately, she did not have much free time, as she was still attending high school.</p><br/><p>As time passed, false rumors had begun spreading, saying that tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d was actually a guy, or she was ugly, and thus will never show herself in public.</p><br/><p>Those who spread the rumors were the ones who had never seen the photos of Su Li and Zhao Youyue that were shared in the author\u2019s group before. Sadly those photos would be removed from the chat servers after some time.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue did not have the energy to entertain these rumors because they were not on the same level as her, they should at least know the basic information of tycoon \u201cYouyue\u201d by now.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue was considered an experienced reader in Qidian, because she was more involved in the field of authors, compared to amateur readers and authors. She also knew how Qidian operated, and knew how to pick out a good book from the extensive list of titles.</p><br/><p>Basically, books that were on the top twenty can be omitted, because eighty percent of them were fixed by people, the High Gods who had no \u201cgodly expertise\u201d would need the fabricated clicks of their minions to retain their ranking.</p><br/><p>Those High Gods who had \u201cgodly expertise\u201d would need no one to fabricate their statistics. What is this godly expertise? Readers would recognize the author, where after reading one of their books, they would want to read their other books. When they start reading a new book from the same author, they would start off by tipping a Sect Master to encourage the author. Such was an author with \u201cgodly expertise\u201d.</p><br/><p>For those who manipulated their book ranking, they did not do it every month because they certainly did not want their dark secrets to be exposed, and it would go on like this in an endless cycle. To them, it was just like using the resources that gained from a war in order to continue the war.</p><br/><p>Long story short, those experienced readers in Qidian knew that the ranking board could not be trusted. The ranking board would be a battlefield of the \u201crich players\u201d, and some people would spend most of their money to emulate the impression of a High God. Of course, they would not gain any profit from it, but they certainly enjoyed its process. While some people would only spend part of their money to gain more popularity or exposure, in order to achieve a balanced income\u2026</p><br/><p>Under these circumstances, Zhao Youyue, who had a significantly influential booklist would ultimately be the big winner!</p><br/><p>Because the ranking boards could not be trusted, many readers can no longer find books that they liked. Over time, experienced readers would start looking for books from privately recommended booklists, while amateur readers would still be looking on the ranking boards, searching for the book they all wanted to read. They would not know that higher rankings did not always mean higher quality. Those rankings were a farce.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue would never recommend a book as a favor for a friend, she insisted that she only adds in her favorite books to her booklist, and this had made her booklist even more popular.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youyue\u2019s family was still watching the godly film at the moment. Zhao Jiayi disliked the odd director at first, but now he was totally watching the film with relish!</p><br/><p>What exactly did he see?</p><br/><p>Of course, it was a magnificent scene, the type that he loved watching the most!</p><br/><p>He would often fantasize Chinese soldiers using modern weaponry to gun down the Western white-skinned boars who dressed themselves up in fur and wielded crude spears!</p><br/><p>Wang Hua was transfixed by the acting abilities of the little girl who was acting as \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d, just how old was she? If she really was just five years old, with those spectacular acting skills, she had a bright future ahead of her!</p><br/><p>The final two episodes of \u201cWar Heroes\u201d was absolutely amazing, it would be even better for people who have watched the previous episodes. The previous contents were an endless tirade of the main protagonist enduring humiliation after humiliation and sufferings at the hands of various vile villains. Now, the final two episodes glorified the exploits of the Heroic Spirit who possessed \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d, beating up the villains and annihilating a whole country single-handedly. What ridiculous madness!</p><br/><p>The plot was stupid, because there was no way a Heroic Spirit would appear in reality. Even though the plot was illogical, the audience wouldn\u2019t give two hoots about it. Those abilities that Tan Xiaoya used had really awesome visual effects, some people might even consider this a science fiction blockbuster movie!</p><br/><p>Zhao Jiayi highly respected logic and realism, but the stunning visual effects in this film had totally subdued him.</p><br/><p>This television drama\u2019s grand finale was unexpectedly amazing!</p><br/><p>Wang Hua thought that the character \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d was fascinating. A little girl becoming a soldier via supernatural means and taking her place among the bloody, violent territory of soldiers!</p><br/><p>Second only to Tan Xiaoya was most certainly the main protagonist Liu Xing and the antagonist Liang Feifan, and the showdown between the two of them. When Liu Xing shouted, \u201cEat this sh*t, Liang Feifan!\u201d, it only made the scene more comical, right before the idiotic superior Liang Feifan was blown up by Tan Xiaoya\u2026</p><br/><p>The Italian artillery that was summoned by Tan Xiaoya at the final moment had terrifying destructive power, this left the three of them watching in awe. The director certainly had to be on something! This was the first time where the capital of Russia and the Empress Catherine was blown to smithereens by an Italian artillery on public television!</p><br/><p>It had much more details compared to Zhao Youyue\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d, it carried far more impact! Zhao Youyue has certainly messed things up, big time!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy must it be Italian artillery, our country\u2019s artillery was one of the best during the world war, that Italian artillery was nothing!\u201d The military buff, Zhao Jiayi grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t you think that the name Italian Artillery sounds awesome? Maybe that brave soul \u2018Li Yunlong\u2019 came from another timeline to possess \u2018Tan Xiaoya\u2019?\u201d Zhao Youyue replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch\u2026 What\u2019s the name of this director, nothing can impress me, but he managed to do it. He has created a new wave of war films!\u201d Zhao Jiayi exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe director\u2019s name is Lin Jianzhong, but I think that such a satirical finale will only raise some fuss for a short time, people will forget move on.\u201d Zhao Youyue said, feeling a little sorry for it.</p><br/><p>Even if people manage to remember \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d, Zhao Youyue would never inherit the abilities of \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d. As \u201cWar Heroes\u201d took place in a universe as realistic as reality can be, she can only obtain a watered down form of that ability that was close to reality. If she did not create the Heroic Spirit \u201cLi Yunlong\u201d, instead of creating the real life Li Yunlong who was as much flesh and blood as anyone else, then she might be able to use that \u201cLi Yunlong card\u201d right now, inheriting the spirit of patriotism from Li Yunlong.</p><br/><p>After the three of them finished watching \u201cWar Heroes\u201d, they were left wanting for more, because watching that little girl Tan Xiaoya\u2019s magnificent explosives raining down on the Russian army alone was indeed enjoyable. That little actress was stellar!</p><br/><p>\u201cWould this have a sequel?\u201d Wang Hua could not help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be impossible to have a continuation after this, the director probably did this on purpose because he knew that it was going to end\u2026\u201d Zhao Jiayi said the truth harshly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, this was actually the first time I ever enjoyed a war film, I wanted to see a film with \u201cTan Xiaoya\u201d as the main protagonist. Let this little girl continue her career as an actress. Her acting skills were top notch, I felt that she became the real \u2018Li Yunlong\u2019 in that film.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is nothing like a war film! But it was indeed interesting, those actors were on steroids in the grand finale\u2026\u201d Zhao Jiayi the critic said.</p><br/><p>\u201cTan Xiaoya would be completely at home in a world with supernatural powers. Maybe I should find an author to write something up, let\u2019s call it \u201cRumble of Little Girls\u201d?\u201d Zhao Youyue smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a fine idea! If little sloth manages to find someone to write it, I would get someone to make it a movie!\u201d Wang Hua said it happily.</p><br/><p>Wang Hua now wanted to watch a war film that starred little girls, the irony was priceless!</p><br/><p>At the same time, several netizens who frequented the Youku video network, started watching the grand finale of \u201cWar Heroes\u201d\u2026</p>\n</div>"}

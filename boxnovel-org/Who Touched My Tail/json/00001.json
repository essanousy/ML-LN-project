It felt really terrible, like he had been run over by a car.</p><br/><p>He groaned and whimpered in bed, unable to find the strength to move. Finally managing to save up some energy, he opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>Everything seemed to be black and white, dim and unclear, showing just how badly in shape he was.</p><br/><p>A pair of small black round beads shows up in his line of sigh, and a large-palmed snow-white fox familiarly slapped his cheeks: \u201cHello, host.\u201d The voice is soft and gentle, not like a fox at all.</p><br/><p>Xue Ling had a mild desire to roll his eyes, but really didn\u2019t have the strength. Fortunately his soul is strong, able to straightforwardly communicate directly with the little fox. \u201cHelp me improve my physique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aftereffects of host crossing space and time is not yet over, and it will improve immediately after it has passed.\u201d The little fox stepped on beside Xue Ling\u2019s head, \u201cHost, close your eyes and recuperate a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ling agreed, reflecting in his heart that it\u2019s no wonder the man from before told him to be careful before he came in. The aftereffects of crossing space and time was so serious that he was now mentally unstable and extremely depressed. In addition, his body was not good in a good state at all. Soon after he closed his eyes, he fell asleep in a daze.</p><br/><p>His dreams were also not restful, the man\u2019s words seemed to be have all turned into written words that lingered in his mind. Although he could not remember exactly who the man was, and his figure became particularly blurred, the words he said seemed to be engraved in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour spirit is unstable, and it will be rather difficult to go against the fate of the world. I will first send you to the lowest level world for you to adapt. You have to try to grab some more luck, except for portion that is required by the Ten Directions World, you can use everything else to strengthen your spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about my tail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you complete the task, the luck gathered by the Ten Directions World will be enough to support you, and it will help you get your tail back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t tricking me? I don\u2019t want to be working for nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur contract has been established. Why would I trick you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Xue Ling is a snow fox that cultivated for thousands of years. Only one more step, and he can become a celestial fox.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that that has already become a distant memory.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, fate has it\u2019s ups and downs, thousands of years of cultivation was destroyed in a moment, and even his nine tails, are all scattered in chaotic time and space.</p><br/><p>In order to find his own tail, Xue Ling spent a very active period of time in search of the Holder of the World, and finally he found the man\u2026 Only, the memory of what happened after that has all disappeared from his mind, what he can remember, is only the man\u2019s words..</p><br/><p>It is impossible to rely on Xue Ling\u2019s own strength to achieve his goals. Only by collecting luck through the completion of the tasks can he re-accumulate the strength of the soul and retrieve his tails.</p><br/><p>This is the conditions that the man gives him that he must abide by, although Xue Ling does not remember exactly why he remembers this so clearly.</p><br/><p>Obviously he was not born the type to obey the rules.</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t know how long he slept, Xue Ling woke up again, and everything in front of him was a little clearer. Judging by the light coming in from outside, it\u2019s already nighttime.</p><br/><p>At last, Xue Ling had more control over his body. Xue Ling reached out and grabbed the little fox and said, \u201cSystem, improve my body, and pass me all the information.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little fox was asleep, and woke up suddenly when caught by Xue Ling. The fox was completely muddleheaded, it took a while before he slowly moved over and put his little head on Xue Ling\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Faint light flashed inside the house, and Xue Ling\u2019s mind slowly cleared up.</p><br/><p>His mind was crammed with a large part of the plot which needed to be processed, and he once again nestled into the quilt.</p><br/><p>\u201cSqueak.\u201d The wooden door was pushed open, and a little apprentice child carrying medicine quietly walked in. He carefully placed his things on a side table, and then squatted down and whispered in Xue Ling\u2019s ear, \u201cYoung master, young master, it\u2019s time for dinner. After eating, you should eat your your medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ling faintly opened his eyes, eyes flashing with a fierce light. The little apprentice that was watching him cannot help but be stunned silly, hands and feet so that he has been staring at his children can not help but be stunned, hands and feet unable to move.</p><br/><p>Their young master has always been good-looking, but usually with a sick complexion, eyes carrying a feeling of illness, and the whole body is very powerless, most of the time even the eyes are half closed. Today\u2026</p><br/><p>Something seems different.</p><br/><p>The little apprentice\u2019s heart beat a little faster, somewhat inexplicably.</p><br/><p>Xue Ling quickly veiled his eyes, and began to use his own hands to sit up, movements a little slow and frail. His voice was weak, and he looked very ill. \u201cWell, bring over the porridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the apprentice saw that he could sit up by himself, he was so touched that his eyes turned red and the little crybaby burst into tears. \u201cCan you sit up, young master? Excellent! I was saying that heavens must be protecting you!!! The little master is such a good person! You must be all right! \u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ling lowered his eyes and did not answer him. He swallowed the porridge and drank the medicine slowly with the apprentice\u2019s help, and then waved him out.</p><br/><p>The little book boy hesitated: \u201cdoes the young master really not need me to wait on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ling shook his head and said, \u201cGo heat up some water, I want to bathe.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The boy shook his head quickly. \u201cYoung master, you\u2019ve been ill for many days and are just getting better. How can you bathe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ling reached out and patted him on the head and said, \u201cYour young master knows his own body, it\u2019ll be fine. Go and boil the water.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the door squeaked shut, Xue Ling slapped this body in disgust and said, \u201cTo be as weak as this, is also rare in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spat out his tongue, face looking a little black. He really didn\u2019t want to describe the taste of the medicine he had just drunk. He has lived for thousands of years and probably had never drunk anything so bitter before.</p><br/><p>Thinking about how he will be stuck with the medicine in the following period of time, Xue Ling frowned and pulled the fur of the Snow White fox beside him.</p><br/><p>The little fox flew into the bed and looked with alarm at Xue Ling.</p><br/><p>According to the little fox, or rather, the information transmitted to Xue Ling by the system, the worlds in which he needs to complete tasks are fictional or virtual worlds, worlds with a host. That is to say, worlds under the governance of the Ten Directions World, but not only constrained by them. The protagonists of the stories are the lucky sons of these worlds, and Xue Ling\u2019s task is to collect the lucky power of these people.</p><br/><p>Because of their own innate strength, the small world subconsciously gathers most of its luck around them, which leads to the whole world basically revolving around them, which is not conducive to the operation of the world. If something happens to the protagonist, the whole world will collapse directly, which will severely weaken the Ten Directions World, and it will also affect other people\u2019s lives, such as those poor cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>So the Ten Directions World had Xue Ling come and destroy their luck, and then he was responsible for recovering it.</p><br/><p>This luck was scattered by the Ten Directions World, taking it back will allow the Ten Directions World that has become fragile due to the collapse one world after another to recover. Only when it recovers, can it help Xue Ling find his tails.</p><br/><p>This is like a biological chain, the top of the chain is the Ten Directions World, and the bottom is the protagonist, in a sense, Xue Ling\u2019s job is to seize the main character\u2019s luck.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s very difficult to snatch luck from the children of fate. Fortunately, Xue Ling is on the side of the Ten Directions World. Although the Ten Directions World is weak, it\u2019s the main world after all. Compared with the subsidiary worlds, it\u2019s still much stronger. So although that tasks are destructive, there\u2019s a bonus, as long as the original plot is destroyed and the fate of the protagonist is changed, the Ten Directions World will automatically extract the luck.</p><br/><p>When he was just improving his physique, Xue Ling roughly skimmed the plot of this story. It is a very simple and ancient text. No wonder that man would say he needs to start from a low level world, it is not that easy to break this kind of plot.</p><br/><p>Because his strength is not enough, so even if the body is improved, he is still a medicine-guzzling pot, unable to stop drinking medicine. Even this can only let him live like a normal person, still sick, but not serious enough to do nothing all day long except coughing blood.</p><br/><p>The original owner of this body was born into a literary family, but was in poor health from an early age, very weak, having lived to sixteen years old is simply a miracle. Originally a young master who only wanted to write to sages, but because his parents were wrongly accused and died, the family\u2019s circumstances declined, and he had to embark on the road to the capital to participate in the imperial examination, hoping to be the first in order to rectify the family grievance in one fell swoop.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he was a pot of medicine, the road to the capital is far away and is not so easy to cross. His journey was stop and go the whole way, seriously ill, doubling the time of the journey. He can do nothing but watch as the imperial examination time is getting closer and closer, but he has not improved. Finally, the young master sighed at and ultimately decided to hand over the family seal to his study partner, asking him to go to the capital to find a man that his family previously saved, a current general of the troops. He hoped that the general could help him once in light of the past.</p><br/><p>Regrettably, he trusted the wrong person.</p><br/><p>That study partner is a time traveller, extremely selfish, from small up until now was very immature, always feeling that he is the protagonist of the world and the young master is the golden finger to help himself. This is only the beginning of his life and young master could not survive anyway, so he took the seal and found the general using the identity of the young master.</p><br/><p>From there it was a smooth journey, thanks to the memories brought from time travelling, as well from his time around the young master reading a lot of the young master\u2019s articles, so during the imperial exam he wrote well and in one move, became the top examinee.</p><br/><p>The general looked after him as the son of a benefactor, and because he had become the champion in one go, he was very impressed with him. Through the intentional or unintentional arrangement and design of his study partner, the two came together, and since then they swept through everything in their path. From there they prospered in the capital, even if they were both men, they still became a wonderful legend.</p><br/><p>The young master was sick all the way and drank medicine, but because he was sick all the way, money was quickly used up. The boy who followed him was kicked to death getting medicine for him. Although the young master\u2019s illness never let up, he dragged himself along and inquired about the general\u2019s office. Only then did he know what the story with his study partner and the general.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t believe it. After all, they grew up together, and the young master regarded his study partner as a brother. Now he didn\u2019t want to believe the news. So he inquired about the places where they often went to and from, took out their family\u2019s ancestral jade to exchange for money, and spent it hiring people to delivery a letter to his study partner. He hoped that they could get together to talk.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The study partner panicked, and became very anxious, but he couldn\u2019t reveal the situation. He could only arrange for the two to have a secret meeting. The young master hoped that he could use his identify plead for his parents\u2019 justice. The companion agreed, but on one condition: the young master would no longer be a young master, but a study companion.</p><br/><p>For the sake of parents\u2019 grievances, the young master agreed.</p><br/><p>The study partner saw that the young mastered agreed so readily, and was very uneasy. Afraid the young master would expose him in front of the general, he made a plan to have the young master go to the general\u2019s mansion to find him, but told the general\u2019s mansion\u2019s people that if someone looking like the young master came by, to beat him to death and bury him in a mass grave.</p><br/><p>The young master died without understanding why, and his parents\u2019 grievance was never rectified. And his study companion, with his jade seal, became the real \u201cyoung master\u201d.</p><br/><p>He went to the general and wept about the viciousness of his study companion, claiming that not only did he hurt him on the way, he also found him at the capital and threatened him with his ancestral jade seal. Because of this, he asked the general\u2019s subordinates to beat him up, but who knew they would directly kill the man? He felt really guilty.</p><br/><p>He acted like a perfect white lotus, pitifully distressed, and the general soothed him, disgusted the \u2018fake\u2019 young master, and didn\u2019t even bother to look into the matter.</p><br/><p>This was the original plot of the story. Xue Ling looked through it all without expression, and then read the novel, clicking his tongue in praise at the author\u2019s version of black and white.</p><br/><p>The original novel\u2019s storyline starts from the when the study partner entered the capital city, using the perspective of the study partner. He has been using the identity of a young master as soon as he entered the city, all the way until finding the general\u2019s palace, to attract the general\u2019s attention. For the imperial examination, using his time traveller\u2019s brain to come up with ideas, acting remarkably like an crafty and interesting shou. The review section should be filled with a pile of people shouting that the shou is cute. The writing is fluid and extraordinary, and the general gong is extremely arrogant, exactly like a perfect gong.</p><br/><p>The original owner is an existence that barely counts as cannon-fodder, even though the text mentioned mentioned that he is really a young master, but from the point of view of the white lotus, he himself was brilliant since childhood, doing everything better than this weak young master. It was the old lady of the house that was jealous of his talent, taking his article to the young master and having him sit in the examination for the young master, really shameless.</p><br/><p>This kind of dreary and desolate recollection is very painful to the readers, causing all kinds of dislike towards the original owner, even if he did not want to get his identity as the young master back, others would still say he is a shameless white lotus.</p><br/><p>Xue Ling felt all kinds of unhappy, looked towards the little fox next to him, \u201cwhy did I get transported into this body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ten Directions World feels that these unfortunate cannon fodders that died in vain or were wronged are more resentful, so they are more suitable for you. After all, you are foreign, and you must have a reason to exist in this world. So when you break the plot, remember to avenge him, and it can also be considered compensation for using their bodies.\u201d The little fox yawned and swept Xue Ling\u2019s hand with his tail. \u201cThis young man is also a fool, schemed to death and yet does not hate others. Only, his persistence to plead for his parents\u2019 grievances is too strong, so the Ten Directions World picked him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Xue Ling squinted his eyes, and that pair of narrowed fox\u2019s eyes seemed even more breath taking, \u201cWhy do you appear in such a form, system?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little fox shivered all over, feeling the discontent within Xue Ling\u2019s eyes. The fox\u2019s fur stuck out at all ends, and it suddenly became fluffy. \u201cIt matches the preferences of the host\u2026 So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The system is a creature placed by Xue Ling\u2019s side by the Ten Directions World, providing him with the plot and some external help, the two people only formally met while crossing space and time, but at that time the system did not have a body, and Xue Ling\u2019s entire soul was wrapped up completely, with no time to care about the other.</p><br/><p>So the moment he opened his eyes was when he saw the system for the first time, and his disgust was barely concealed.</p><br/><p>Xue Ling lifted up the system and spoke with disdain: \u201cThis is simply throwing away the face of all foxes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The system is indignant: It\u2019s just a form! I\u2019m not a real fox, host, stop looking like you want to peel off my face, it\u2019s so scary! QAQQAQ!!!

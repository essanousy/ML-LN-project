The aroma spread across his mouth, making him want to cry from joy.</p><br/><p>There was acommotion in the woods; the man had returned witha blood-stained sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo me a favor.\"</p><br/><p>The dragonran over to take a look and saw that there was a dead wild boar next to theman. It had been killed with amazing skill. The wound wasn't big, and therehadn't been much bleeding.</p><br/><p>The fine,beautiful sword in the man's hand was still slowly dripping with blood, but hejust leaned quietly against a tree trunk. His gaze was extremely calm, hisexpression as cold and beautiful as ever, almost as though he was a perfectstatue made of stone.</p><br/><p>Um\u2026 How handsome.</p><br/><p>The dragonlooked at the man and couldn't help thinking: If\u2026 If he had once been a man,he had probably been just as amazing, right?</p><br/><p>The dragon was well-behaved and cleverlydragged the boar towards the rack.</p><br/><p>\"Rekindlethe fire.\" The man spoke as he rearranged the wood in for the fire. \"There aretwo countries nearby, and two palaces. Which one do you want to go to?\"</p><br/><p>The dragon thought about it, then asked,\u201cWhich palace has a princess?\"</p><br/><p>The mansilent for half a beat, then opened his mouth to say:</p><br/><p>\"They both do, but the princess of XilanKingdom is better looking.\"</p><br/><p>The dragon nodded, \u201cMm, then I'll go toXilan Kingdom.\"</p><br/><p>A beautifulprincess would stir up a bigger fuss, and there would be more knights who wouldcome to save the princess, which meant he wouldn't be bored.</p><br/><p>The mansaid, \u201cXilan Kingdom is very close by. If you're flying, it only takeshalf an hour. Just head west, and when you see a lake, turn north and you'll bethere.\"</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>As a dragonwho had lost his memories, he frowned, \"Where is 'west', and what is 'north'?\"</p><br/><p>The manlooked at the dragon and seemed to be able to tell what he was hung up on at aglance. He replied, \"The place where the sun comes out from is the west.\"</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The dragon thanked himvery sincerely.</p><br/><p>The man nolonger raised his head and spoke indifferently, \"Go after you've eaten theroasted wild boar. I'll share some more common sense with you while you'rehere.\"</p><br/><p>The corners of the dragon's eyes were damp.</p><br/><p>Ever sincehe became a dragon, he would occasionally meet some human beings while catchingbirds and picking fruits, but all of them were afraid of him. Some would crouchon the ground and wrap their arms around their head in fear, while others wouldthrow stones at him before running away.</p><br/><p>This was the first time that someone.</p><br/><p>Was being so kind to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really a good man.\u201d Thedragon emotionally spoke from his heart.</p><br/><p>The man's movements stopped for a moment, andhe remained silent.</p><br/><p>The dragoncontinued to ask, \u201cOh, right! What's your name? If there's a chance, I'llrepay you in the future!!\"</p><br/><p>\u201cShiloh.\u201d The man's tone was bland.</p><br/><p>Shilohsprinkled the spices evenly over the roasting meat, then asked the dragon, \"\u2026What about you? What's your name?\"</p><br/><p>The dragonscratched his head and laughed somewhat awkwardly, \"I seem to have forgotten myoriginal name.\"</p><br/><p>Shiloh's eyes were hooded, \u201cThen, do youhave a new name?\"</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The dragonwas uncertain as he said, \"I haven't thought about it. What do you think of thename Tammy?\"</p><br/><p>Shiloh, whowas in the process of putting the condiments away, seemed to hesitate beforenodding, \"\u2026 It sounds good.\"</p><br/><p>The dragon\u2019s eyes turned into slits from hissmile, \"Yes, I also feel that it sounds great.\"</p><br/><p>Shiloh toldTammy: When flying at a certain altitude, maintain a constant pace and don'tworry about falling. When spraying fire, he needed to keep the intensity lightand long. He shouldn't let give others a chance to hit his eyes or the back ofhis neck, but everywhere else wasn't a big deal. Those two places were his onlyfatal points. </p><br/><p>\"To tellyou the truth, I really suspect that you were originally a dragon. How couldyou know so much?\"</p><br/><p>Shilohheard him, but said nothing. He only tore off the wild boar's leg and handed itto Tammy.</p><br/><p>Tammylooked at Shiloh and thought: Ah, he's really such a handsome and fierce andgentle man. If I had once been a person, I probably looked like that too.</p><br/><p>Afterfinishing the roast meat, Tammy told Shiloh, \u201cI\u2019m going to go snatch aprincess now.\" </p><br/><p>\"Mm.\" Shiloh made a sound of acknowledgement.</p><br/><p>Tammyhesitated for a moment, then looked at him and said, \"This is my first timegoing to catch a princess\u2026 Could you maybe\u2026 come with me?\"</p><br/><p>Shiloh shook his head, \u201cI have my ownmatters to attend to.\"</p><br/><p>Tammy sighed and was somewhat disappointed ashe went forth.</p><br/><p>Nngh, the dragon had to go snatch aprincess by himself.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

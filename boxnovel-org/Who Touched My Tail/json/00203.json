Xue Ling lifted up his head to look at the blue sky, and then down to where he was walking on the blue sea, and his emotions steadied a little compared with his initial excitement. </span></p><br/><p><span>Su Xuanyan was still holding onto the hand that had been kissed. Xue Ling struggled, then said weakly, \"Wasn't it just kissed by a child? You're still bothered by it.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Su Xuanyan looked back at him and did not answer his question. Instead, he threw out a new question, asking, \u201cDo you like children?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling asked curiously, \"Why would you ask? Do you want children?\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Su Xuanyan shook his head and said, \u201cBoth of them have no choice. They are the last of their line. There is nobody else to inherit their commercial empires, so they need to have children.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut Yuan Chuanbai seems very fond of the two\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe also really likes cats and dogs. But, they've prepared for many years before deciding to have children; they should have already made the proper preparations and are confident they can raise them well.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Speaking of this point, Xue Ling suddenly realized what Su Xuanyan meant to ask, \"Are you asking me if I want to have children? Because the Su Family also needs heirs?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Su Xuanyan shook his head and said, \u201cNo.\u201d He looked at Xue Ling and laughed all of a sudden, saying, \"If you want a child, we can have Liunian and them get one.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling: \u201c\u2026\u201d You shouldn't sell out your little brother so quickly\u2026 </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBetween us, there is no need to consider so far into the future. We still have a lot of time, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to make these decisions and try out the life that you want to live.\" Su Xuanyan's words were full of implications, but Xue Ling couldn't understand what he wanted to express. Perhaps when he really recovered his memories, he'd know what he was trying to suggest.</span></p><br/><p><span>With this in mind, Xue Ling caught up with the other party again. Should he be trying to quicken his pace? Su Xuanyan seemed to have remembered everything, but he kept forgetting everything after seeing it over and over again. It looked like even if he remembered it, without finishing the system's so-called 'entertainment circle counterattack' task, some sort of mysterious power still had the ability to erase everything he recalled.</span></p><br/><p><span>Clearly, these memories belonged to both of them, but only one person held them now, and that kind of feeling was not good at all. Xue Ling might not be a gentle person, but looking at it from where he was standing, he was now a little distressed for Su Xuanyan. </span></p><br/><p><span>How did his heart feel when he alone was carrying the past of two people? </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling would sometimes ask himself this. </span></p><br/><p><span>The underwater city was really a good place to go for relaxation. Even if they spent an entire day doing nothing but lying in bed and watching the ocean view, looking on as schools of fish swam in front of their room, it was also a unique experience. </span></p><br/><p><span>Although the premise for that was that the bed belonged to him alone.</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling lay in bed and watched the sea for a long time. Suddenly, the other side of the bed dipped down, and he turned his head fiercely, stretching out his foot to kick Su Xuanyan away. \"This is my bed!!! There are so many rooms here! Why do I have to share a room with you?!\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Su Xuanyan was totally unaffected. Taking advantage of the fact that he was a bit taller than Xue Ling, Su Xuanyan reached out and grabbed his ankle, pulling him a little closer to his side. \"Because I brought you here.\" In other words, since he was paying, he was happy and willing to share a room.</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling kicked his foot, feeling a little aggrieved, then climbed up to tug on Su Xuanyan's hand, biting it in frustration. Su Xuanyan didn't struggle at all, and his gaze was very gentle, treating Xue Ling's actions as though he was merely fooling around rather than a genuine protest. </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling also knew that it was unrealistic to drive him out, so he went off and wrapped himself in the quilt, only to be rolled back out by Su Xuanyan, \"Don't hole up in there. Go take a bath and change your clothes first. After that, we'll go eat.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling made an 'oh' sound, and then reluctantly made his way over to get his things and wash up. </span></p><br/><p><span>Wasn't it just a bed? It wasn't like they'd never slept together before. He didn't remember anything now, and Su Xuanyan wouldn't do anything to him out of desperation. </span></p><br/><p><span>And if he really tried something, they would probably start fighting on the spot.</span></p><br/><p><span>After playing in Seabed City for a few days, the two of them went to the group of islands that Su Xuanyan said belonged to him. Xue Ling spent ten days playing around happily, then gathered himself and prepared to be abused by Fan Yueze. </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling and Su Liunian would both appear in the second part of the film, and the rivalry between the two would also increase during this part. Xue Ling and Su Liunian lived in the same city, so the crew arranged for them to board the same plane. </span></p><div><div></div></div><br/><p><span>So, the three Su Family brothers unexpectedly ran into each other while seeing people off.</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling expressionlessly retrieved his suitcase from Su Xuanyan's hands and pretended that he didn't know Su Xuanyan at all. </span></p><br/><p><span>But apparently, Su Liunian did not feel that way. He wasn't surprised at all seeing that his eldest brother was sending Xue Ling to the airport; he had already moved into Xue Ling's place for almost a month now, and was just short of bringing him back home. Su Liunian had already acknowledged that Xue Ling would become part of their family. So he was very calm when he greeted them, asking as soon as he came up, \"Eldest brother, when do you plan to bring Little Ling home?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling: \u201c\u2026\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cProbably around the New Year.\u201d Su Xuanyan was very serious as he answered his little brother's question. \"From how he's currently refusing to acknowledge having any connection to me, you can probably tell that the revolution hasn't succeeded yet.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling: \u201c\u2026\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>Su Liunian took a look at the suitcase in Xue Ling\u2019s hand, and made an 'oh' sound that seemed to say, elder brother, you're really failing. You've already moved in for so long, but still haven't accomplished what you set out to do.</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling turned around and went to the boarding gate. He didn't want to deal with these bastards at all. </span></p><br/><p><span>After boarding the plane, Su Liunian finally begged Xue Ling for mercy. His expression was helpless as he said, \"I didn't know that you haven't agreed to be with my eldest brother yet. Are you unhappy because we talked like that earlier?\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling said strangely, \u201cNot unhappy\u2026 I just feel a little embarrassed\u2026\" </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI feel embarrassed too.\u201d Although he wasn't sitting in the right seat, they had booked out the entire first class cabin, so it didn't matter where he sat. Su Liunian sat down next to Xue Ling and continued, \"Although I've always wanted to see what elder brother would be like when he found someone he liked, I was still a little caught off guard when you really appeared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling nodded and motioned him to continue explaining why he was caught off guard.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEldest brother has always been very stable. Other than disappearing for a year this time to who knows where, in front of me he always maintains the image of a gentle elder brother. Now that he's fallen in love, it seems like he's in another state. You guys haven't even known each other for long, but he's already moved into your house. He's not forcing you, right?\" Su Liunian should be forgiven for his anxiety; after all, after seeing those photos from before, he had constantly felt that his eldest brother was too extreme in his courtship. He was worried that Su Xuanyan might accidentally do something to Xue Ling.</span></p><br/><p><span>The corners of Xue Ling's lips twitched, and he shook his head. </span></p><br/><p><span>Su Xuanyan was indeed a very gentle person, and he didn't have any bad habits that rich children tended to have. Sometimes, when he had a lot of work to deal with, he would even spend the night in the study or living room out of concern that he might disturb Xue Ling's rest. At first, Xue Ling hadn't even realized because Su Xuanyan tended to wake up early, and by the time he woke up, he basically didn't even know where Su Xuanyan had spent the night. Later on, there was one night where he had gotten up in the middle of the night to pour himself some water, and discovered that Su Xuanyan was sleeping on the sofa in the living room.</span></p><br/><p><span>From then on, Xue Ling would leave a lamp on for the other party before going to bed, indicating that he should still come back to bed no matter how late it was. </span></p><br/><p><span>In fact, the two of them get along very naturally. Although Xue Ling couldn't remember many things between them, very often, some of their actions revealed how familiar they were with each other. Over time, Xue Ling could feel himself turning into someone as gentle as Su Xuanyan, learning to compromise and sympathize with other people. So in fact, living together with Su Xuanyan was not a problem for him.</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn't know what Su Xuanyan had done to make Su Liunian misunderstand. How come Su Liunian would feel that his eldest brother would do something to him?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026\u201d Su Liunian looked like he wanted to have a heart-to-heart conversation, and leaned close to whisper to Xue Ling, \"It's been really hard on my eldest brother. Me and our second brother's affairs always make his head ache, so I've always wanted him to find someone he likes. But he was always indifferent to everyone until you appeared. It makes me really happy.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling: \u201c\u2026\u201d Hey, don\u2019t be so casual about revealing your family\u2019s little secrets to people you don\u2019t know. Xue Ling didn't want to know anything about Su Liunian and his second brother at all! Even if Su Xuanyan had brought it up before! Even if he could more or less guess, there was no need to say it like this! </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut, I won\u2019t force you to accept him. I believe that my eldest brother is such a good person that he'll definitely be able to win you by virtue of his personal charm!\"</span></p><div><div></div></div><br/><p><span>Xue Ling turned his head and was too lazy to concern himself with the film emperor who was trying to sell him his eldest brother. \"Probably. Perhaps that day isn't so far off.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Su Liunian didn't know what he was talking about, but couldn't ask him to repeat himself. Seeing that he didn't intend to continue the conversation, he opened his own nano-computer and discreetly reported to his eldest brother, saying that Xue Ling showed no interest in discussing anything related to him~</span></p><br/><p><span>The two of them travelled together, and it indeed increased their understanding of each other. Xue Ling learned that although Su Liunian seemed to always be smiling like a spring breeze on the surface, in private, he was a little black-bellied. Despite being a film emperor, he didn't put on airs, and was very easy to get along with, but he could be extraordinarily capricious and unwilling to pay attention to certain things.</span></p><br/><p><span>They no longer discussed Su Xuanyan, and moved on to enthusiastically discuss various issues regarding the script all the way until they disembarked. They even arranged a time to properly discuss the other party's fight scenes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Su Liunian was a very experienced actor. His understanding of the roles came from his perspective as both an actor and the author, whereas Xue Ling's perspective was more from the angle of readers and fans. After their discussion, the characters of the two protagonists became even more well-rounded, and the scenes they had to cooperate together for also went very smoothly. </span></p><br/><p><span>Both of them seemed to have been born for acting. They were very good at controlling the scene, and did not oppress each other with their strength. The interaction between the two was mixture of give and take; the assistant director had originally been worried that Xue Ling would be unable to keep up with Su Liunian, but later, he began to worry that the other actors would be unable to keep up with the two of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Fan Yueze\u2019s mood was very good due to these two's guaranteed performance. Even if some of the supporting actors needed to work hard and reshoot multiple times, he was quite tolerating of the situation. Other than his usual rushed attitude, the more the two of them cooperated, the less exacting Fan Yueze became. </span></p><br/><p><span>With Su Liunian there, Xue Ling gradually became familiar with Director Fan. Fan Yueze's private personality was rather cheap, and he dared to say anything. He would even flirt occasionally with Su Liunian, and even if he ended up beaten back, he never seemed to get bored of it. But once he started working, his entire temperament changed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Su Liunian said before that Fan Yueze had devoted his life to movies, and Xue Ling had to agree.</span></p><br/><p><span>Director Fan really ran at full tilt. </span></p><br/><p><span>Because they were now familiar, Xue Ling received a recommendation. Even in the midst of filming, Director Fan still found time to tell Xue Ling about a film that he might be suited for, which surprised Xue Ling a bit.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe director is a good friend of mine. If you aren't put off by the fact that he's relatively new and hasn't done many films, I really think you should give it a try. I've seen the script for his film, and considering his ability, there's a high chance of winning an award with it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling collected the small note that Fan Yueze handed over to him, and looked him up online.</span></p><br/><p><span>Fan Yueze recommended him to a new director named Zhu Ruoqiu. He was not very famous in the entertainment circle right now, and had pitifully few works. The only things he could find were two MVs. Xue Ling watched them, and could tell that the director's ideas and techniques were very good. However, due to the fact that they were MVs, and after going through some garbage editing, the director's brilliance had been completely buried.</span></p><br/><p><span>Fan Yueze had told him that the script was written by the director himself, and it was currently seeking funding. Xue Ling was very well suited for the role of the male protagonist, so Fan Yueze suggested that Xue Ling go to recommend himself for the role. Su Liunian overheard their conversation, and leaned over to look at what Xue Ling was watching.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDoes Little Ling plan to give it a try? If Fan Yueze says that it can win awards, then it definitely will~ If you want to give a try, I can have someone go over and obtain a copy of the script. I'll invest in it if it's good.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling shook his head, then felt that he wasn't expressing himself clearly, and nodded. \"No need. I'll find some time to contact Director Zhu and give it a try. If it's really doable, I'll talk to Xuanyan about investment.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Su Liunian noticed that he was willing to find his eldest brother, and was naturally delighted. In any case, it still involved his family, and he didn't care if he wasn't putting in a portion of the money.</span></p><br/><p><span>Half a month later, they finished filming abroad and returned to Hua Country to continue shooting. Xue Ling had two days of free time, and first contacted Zhu Ruoqiu. After setting a meeting time, he brought Su Xuanyan with him for a visit. </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling believed in Fan Yueze\u2019s vision - his enthusiasm for film was obvious to all. Since he was making a recommendation for Xue Ling to take on a role, it should be a very good script.</span></p><br/><p>\u00a0 </p><br/><p></p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

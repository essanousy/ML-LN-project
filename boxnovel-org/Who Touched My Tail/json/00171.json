Murphy was called in as backup for the negotiations. Although she had already given up on Kent and his mother completely, when the child that she had raised knelt in front of her and begged her for the last time, she had no way to harden her heart and drive him away. </span></p><br/><p><span>This was Murphy's first time meeting Ivan. She felt a little helpless - if she had met this child at any other time, perhaps she would have liked him. But now, this child had already been destroyed, and even if the poison could be cured, his personality had already become warped. </span></p><br/><p><span>Murphy\u2019s spiritual power could cover the entire capital, so Kent asked her to take them to the palace. </span></p><br/><p><span>Although she was very powerful, casting a net and searching through still required a lot of energy. But before Murphy could even begin, the two people they were looking for materialized in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The atmosphere became rather awkward. Murphy slowly adjusted her posture and resumed her high and mighty stance. She opened her mouth to say, \"Since the people you wanted to see have already arrived, I won't disturb you any longer. I'm leaving.\" She was unwilling to be further involved in this matter. If anything happened to her, the royal family would truly be doomed. Murphy had not lived for so many years for nothing, and although her appearance belied her age, her experience was genuine.</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling spoke lightly, \u201cIt's better if Your Highness Murphy stays. In case something happens here, you can serve as a witness.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Murphy's steps paused. Now that Xue Ling had said this, it was obvious that something big would happen tonight. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not going to meddle in tonight\u2019s business.\u201d Murphy sighed helplessly. \u201cSince it's like this, could Your\u2026 Excellency give the royal family a way out?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling\u2019s voice was lazy. \u201cI was never enemies with the royal family. But I will not let these two people go. Since Your Highness Murphy has said that you will not interfere, then this matter will naturally not involve the royal family.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>After obtaining this promise, Murphy stopped speaking. This world had always been one where strength was respected. In the face of absolute power, the royal family could not say anything more and could only maintain their silence as a way of self-preservation.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kent gave Murphy an obscure, profound look. He was very clear about Her Highness's character, and knew that she was always thinking for the sake of the royal family. But no one would have anything good to say about the other side after being so obviously tossed aside. </span></p><br/><p><span>Ivan glanced hesitatingly at Xue Ling. He didn't know why, but he now had an inexplicable fear of the other party. \"Oliver\u2026\" Kent placed an arm around his shoulders and pushed him forward, signaling for him to speak slowly and not be anxious. </span></p><br/><p><span class=\"jum\">Ivan closed his eyes and finally summoned up the courage to say, \u201cOliver, can we have a proper talk? I know I was wrong before, I shouldn't have given you that curse and gone against your wishes, but I really have no way to do anything to Kent, you know? I really love him, and I also really love you. Both of you are important parts of my life, and I can\u2019t afford to lose either of you. That\u2019s why I came up with that kind of solution\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOliver, we no longer have a contract between us. You've already punished me severely with your departure. I was very heartbroken, too. I can accept that you want to get your revenge on me, but don't do anything to Kent, okay?\" He looked at Xue Ling, and for a moment, there was a flash of honesty in his eyes. \"Kent indeed did something unforgivable to your parents, but he didn\u2019t know who they were\u2026 He was just a child who wanted to give his mother the best. Since you miss your parents so much, you should be able to understand Kent, right?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling sneered, \u201cHe wanted to give his mother the best, so he deliberately planned to kill my parents. That's true, demonic beasts have no human rights and were born to be hunted by human beings. So there is nothing wrong with me taking his life as an offering to my parents, right?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt's not like that.\u201d Ivan quickly retorted, \u201cOliver, you're misunderstanding my words. My meaning is that vengeance has a way of rebounding upon oneself. If you keep trying to get revenge like this, the situation will only snowball from generation to generation.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat, are you going to have a son for him?\u201d Xue Ling\u2019s expression was indifferent. \"There's no point giving birth to one. I'll strangle it once it's born.\"</span></p><div><div></div></div><br/><p><span>Ivan\u2019s eyes were red. Why was this person like this? Why were his words all useless? They didn't have any common viewpoints at all, and he only knew how to fight and kill. How could he have thought that Oliver was just like a gentle elder brother back then! </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOliver! How can you say that? No matter what, children are innocent! \u201c</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, and I am innocent, too.\u201d Xue Ling was already turning a little impatient. Ivan\u2019s tone and attitude remained unchanged, and he didn't like those Holy Saint-type words of his at all. An eye for an eye was his method of conduct. \"Let's not talk anymore nonsense. Aren't you innocent too? Then why did the Queen poison you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Ivan\u2019s own logic came to a stop here. \"Maybe the Queen just thought that I wasn\u2019t suitable for Kent. No matter what, she was doing it for Kent's sake.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling felt that Ivan\u2019s logic was about to move even him. Looking at Ivan's expression that seemed like he was about to cry, he was really amazed at how much of a Holy Saint he was; he was really the type who would offer themselves up for death just to prove their innocence. \"Fine then, I'll give the two of you a choice.\" He pointed at the two of them, and lifted up two fingers.\" Tonight, only one of you will survive.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>His tone was so indifferent that it seemed that he was not talking about murder, but about a simple game. \u201cIf Kent lives, then you will die of poison. Or, if you kill him, I'll have my love dispel your poison, and ensure that you can live on safe and healthy for a long time.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Kent\u2019s expression was very ugly: \u201cYou were lying to me back then when you said that you were retaliating against me for him?\" He thought that Oliver still cared about Ivan, but now, he was making this kind of demand, saying that only one of them will survive tonight, and the choice was not even in his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI said many more things before saying that it was for his sake. Did Your Highness the Crown Prince ignore them all?\" Xue Ling curved his lips, \"Or did you think that poisoning by someone who has nothing to do with me would make me angry enough to kill you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kent had nothing to say. In fact, Oliver's intention to kill him had never changed. At first, he didn\u2019t care. Later, he didn\u2019t think that Oliver would be able to make a move against him. Frankly speaking, he never took the matter of killing Oliver's parents seriously. After all, they weren't human beings, they were just two demonic beasts. To him, killing two demonic beasts was no big deal at all. Instead, they should be grateful that they were valuable, and flattered that he had taken the time to catch them. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEnough. Ivan, make your choice. Will you kill Kent and clear out all the accounts? Since you've given me such a curse, then it makes sense for us to reach a day where you pick up your sword and help me do what I can no longer do.\u201d There was a beautiful smile on his lips. It made his entire face curve and had a kind of attractive charm. \"Come on, Ivan, let me see whether you believe that your Kent is more important, or yourself?\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Ivan\u2019s face was pale. He looked at Kent and retreated from his embrace, step by step.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kent coaxed him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t believe him, Ivan. We can definitely still find a way to get rid of your poison without them.\" He looked at Xi, the man who had been standing silently beside Xue Ling from the beginning. He had just noticed that in Xue Ling's words, Xue Ling himself had no ability to dispel the poison. What he had said was that he would have this man do it for him. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour Excellency, I am a Prince of this country - the Crown Prince. I can give you anything you want, so could you please dispel the poison in my lover? Whatever Oliver is giving you, I can give you double!\" Kent acted like a desperate person who was chaotically, anxiously rushing to find a doctor.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Xi barely even gave him a glance. He bowed his head and kissed Xue Ling\u2019s forehead, saying, \u201cWhen will everything be settled? What would you like to eat tonight?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling laughed, hugged his neck, then looked up at Kent and said, \u201cWhat do you want to do? Buy him? Perhaps you could consider selling your body, but he might not necessarily want it~\" </span></p><br/><p><span>Ivan looked at the intimacy between two and asked Xue Ling, \u201cOliver, is that your new contractor? It's because of him that you become what you are today, right? The Oliver that used to treat me so well, so gently\u2026 He would absolutely never be like this. It was him, wasn't it?! He made you like this, right?!\u201d The more he questioned, the more hysterical he seemed. </span></p><br/><p><span>Xue Ling sneered then spoke coldly, \u201cWhen I broke the contract with you back then, I made it very clear that we would only speak about forgiveness after I have killed your lover. We no longer have any relationship between us. Now, all you have to do is follow my words and do what I want you to do. As long as you do so, perhaps I can even consider forgiving you.\" </span></p><div><div></div></div><br/><p><span>He tossed a knife onto the ground and said, \u201cTake this. It should be white going in, and red coming out. Be good, you'll soon be able to live on. Don't wait for me to lose patience; he'll still die, but you\u2026 we don't know what you'll become~\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Ivan shivered. His expression was very strange; even if he had ten more brains, he would never have thought that he would come to this point one day. He didn\u2019t know exactly why these things happened, but he had already run out of time.</span></p><br/><p><span>His hair and eye color were darkening at a speed visible to the naked eye. Darkness was eroding the light elements in his body step by step and soon, his body would completely turn into a cradle for the darkness. He would become a devil, a wild being unable to live in the sunshine, banished to the boundless darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kent looked at Ivan for a long time and finally said, \u201cIvan, you know, I can\u2019t die\u2026\u201d He gave Ivan a slightly evasive look. Now that things had reached this point, he had no way to righteously and solemnly tell Ivan to kill him. \u201cI still have my country, my people\u2026 My mother and my friends\u2026 But Ivan, you only have me\u2026\u201d The meaning underneath his words was, could you die for me instead?</span></p><br/><p><span>Ivan stared at him, stunned. In fact, according to his personality, if Kent told him loudly that he was willing to die for him and asked him to quickly kill him, perhaps he would cry and stab himself instead so that he could die a better death. </span></p><br/><p><span>But Kent spoke like this. </span></p><br/><p><span>If Ivan was the same Ivan from before who had not yet entered the Demonic Beast Forest, had not been betrayed, and stayed true to his Holy Saint heart instead of deceiving himself, he might really have thought about these things and died instead of Kent, but now Ivan had changed. He trusted Kent before, but Kent had taken off his own mask and spoken to him like this. </span></p><br/><p><span>Ivan looked at him and said slowly, \u201cKent, even if I don\u2019t make a move against you, you\u2019re still going to die\u2026\u201d Xue Ling never said that he would give up killing Kent if Ivan died. He had always said the same thing; as long as Kent died, Ivan could live. He didn\u2019t say the rest, but Ivan understood. </span></p><br/><p><span>He now understood what Ololet had said to him in the Demonic Beast Forest. He knew how painful it was to die from losing the power of light bit by bit. He also understood how it felt to betray relatives, and even the people he valued most. </span></p><br/><p><span>Ivan's heart was filled with mixed feelings as he picked the knife up from the ground and looked at Kent, but the question from his mouth was directed towards Xue Ling, \u201cIf I kill him, will it end everything between us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d As long as Kent and his mother died, all the wishes that the original owner of this body had would be fulfilled. After doing all this, as well as thoroughly changing Ivan's character, Xue Ling could be completely certain that the story would no longer go back to the original plot line, so he could leave and probably never have to come back. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood.\u201d Ivan's reply was very soft. He stepped up to Kent, reached out, and touched Kent\u2019s face. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKent, close your eyes. I promise you, soon, it won\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d He smiled the same way he had when Kent first met him, his smile very pure, very lovely. \"Your country, and Her Highness Murphy, all that is yours, I will take care of for you\u2026 If I were to do it, it definitely won't hurt very much. But if it was him, I can't think of how he would torture you\u2026 This is for your sake, Kent.\" </span></p><br/><p><span>His eyebrows were bent from his smile and the curve of his mouth took on a delicate, strange edge. \"So, Kent, go die.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Ivan\u2019s eyes were filled with the dizzying color of blood. Kent watched on in astonishment as it happened; his body wasn't under his control, and he had no way to stop Ivan's movements\u2026 </span></p><br/><p><span>He had no idea that Ivan would really do it, and stab his heart with the knife. Red blood spurted onto Ivan's face, and the awareness in his eyes slowly collapsed\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span>Kent\u2019s last glimpse of life was seeing Ivan lose his mind, retreat a few steps, and fall into a pool of his blood.</span></p><br/><p><span>A shrill scream rang through the palace that night.</span></p><br/><p></p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

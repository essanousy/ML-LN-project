His face became ugly in an instant, let alone seeingthe blood stained cloth at the head of the bed.</p><br/><p>Xue Ling greeted him, \u201cI thought about several moreoptions last night. Come and help me see which one is more suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Hui's face was blank, \u201cImperial Doctor Lin told methat you stayed up late again last night.\u201d </p><br/><p>Xue Ling laughed, \"Hehe, did he go to complain? Wasn't itjust coughing up some blood this morning, he should be used to it by now.\" </p><br/><p>\u201cStrategies and what not are not critical, what mattersis your body.\u201d Cong Hui emphasized.</p><br/><p>He remembered this person looked like when he first saw him,his face was rosy, his pair of fox\u2019s eyes were alluring, red robe on his body,and when he laughed, he was brilliant and alluring. During his time on thebattlefield, he had lost weight at a speed visible to the naked eye. Hisbeautiful face was now left with eye-catching and some traces of the past. Hislips were always pale. When he stood up, he seemed an empty rack, one can seehis bones even through his clothing, making people afraid that if a sudden gustof wind came, he would be blown away. </p><br/><p>\u201cIt's just dying in any case, it's good to help you outmore before that happens.\" Xue Ling waved his hand indifferently, \u201cComeand see, I don\u2019t have much time left, so I think it\u2019s better for us to set up aplan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Something indecipherable flashed through Cong Hui's eyes, hestood there for a long time, and finally could only sigh helplessly, \u201cEn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, he can only speed up the battle, striving to winthis battle before his body is completely worn down.</p><br/><p>Xue Ling also wants to solve it quickly. After all, thesystem tells him that in two days, the body will be done for, and he will leavethe world automatically. Xue Ling still hadn't thought of a way to make thegeneral die without marrying and having children, so he no longer thought aboutit. </p><br/><p>He's already gotten the luck of one person anyway, it doesn'tmatter if he doesn't take the rest, right?</p><br/><p>The system was shocked by his passive attitude andexpressed, is this even really his host?!</p><br/><p>Xue Ling rolled his eyes, asking him to make a man's lifeunsatisfactory with no reason, someone with whom he had no grievances in thepast and were not enemies in the present, according to his three views, he trulycould not make a move. He could only hope that his current efforts were reallyuseful, and the general really has some feelings towards him.</p><br/><p>Xue Ling\u2019s strategy was to lure the enemy in deep, and thencarry out wholesale annihilation, which was difficult to implement. Afterfinalizing the plan, with orders from Cong Hui, the troops were immediatelymobilized. After that, everything was left in the hands of the general, and XueLing was relieved at last.</p><br/><p>If their plan really succeeds, he should be able to witness theirvictory before he dies.</p><br/><p>The battlefield is changing rapidly. Xue Ling's plan coversalmost all the risks, so the team led by Cong Hui swept all the way to theother side\u2019s base camp and captured the opposing commander directly.</p><br/><p>On the battlefield, there was endless cheering, but therewas something wrong with Cong Hui.</p><br/><p>A fast horse came from behind, and the soldier was in ahurry, his face covered with tears.</p><br/><p>He is a small soldier in charge of the safety of Xue Ling.In the past, he had always watched the military advisor assist the general andwin battles, his worship of the military advisor was already imprinted in hisbones. Now, with a face full of tears, he pulled on the rains, the man droppedhimself directly from the horse and stumbled towards Cong Hui: \u201cGeneral! Themilitary adviser! Has passed away!!!!\"</p><br/><p>His voice was not very loud amidst the surrounding cheers,but it was like a thunderstorm in Cong Hui\u2019s ears. The joy of victory waspulled away from him at this time, he turned his body and headed for the basecamp.</p><br/><p>But no matter how fast he urges his horse, it still can\u2019tcatch up with the speed of a person\u2019s life passing away. When Cong Hui arrivesat Xue Ling\u2019s camp, only Imperial Doctor Lin's rueful face could be seen.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cDon't grieve too much.\u201d Is what the doctor said.Besides this, there was nothing else he could say.</p><br/><p>There were no other people inside,\u00a0 the news of victory in the front battlefielddid not seem to infect the base camp in the rear. Due to the passing away of themilitary advisor, many people were silent, heads hanging, faces sad.</p><br/><p>The soldiers who came back with the general were equallysilent. This war would not have ended so soon without the military advisor. Nowthat the war had been won, the military advisor didn't even have time tocelebrate before passing away, no one could accept this outcome.</p><br/><p>Although he knew there would be such a day, when Cong Huiapproached him, his hand was still shaking.</p><br/><p>The man lay quietly in bed with a smile on his face. Itseemed as if everything was under control. He was obviously in the back camp,but he knew all the details clearly. Those beautiful eyes have been closedforever, face pale, lips almost bloodless.</p><br/><p>He was already thin to the point of being able to see thecheekbones on his face, as long as he reaches out to touch, he knows that insidethe clothes are empty, truly nothing but skin and bones. Being able to enduretill today before finally flickering out, is also a kind of strength.</p><br/><p>Never has Cong Hui seen a person like him, like the mostdazzling of stars, suddenly shining in front of his eyes. The day of the palaceexamination is like the most brilliant moment in his life. And then, with theirfollowing interactions, like a stream of flowing water, he flowed slowly intohis heart, and while he was completely unknowing, occupied his heart completely.As he decided, after he cared for him more and more, that after this war,regardless of the results, he has to say it clearly, that man quietly let go ofthe world.</p><br/><p>His heart seems to be broken into pieces, following thisperson to vanish into coldness.</p><br/><p>Cong Hui stretched out his hand and touched his face, therewas still a slight temperature on his body, his eyes heated up, in these yearsof life, the lord had not shed a single tear, but at this moment there was noway to endure.</p><br/><p>He reached out and wrapped the person whose soul had alreadyleft in his arms. Tears fell, dampening his robes.</p><br/><p>It was a long time later that people saw their generalcoming out of the camp.</p><br/><p>He was still as calm as ever, without any expression on hisface, but it seemed that there was something different.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrike the camp, we are returning in victory.\" Hisvoice was low and deep, if listening clearly, was a little hoarse.</p><br/><p>Obviously it was a victory, but the previous warm atmospherein the barracks was strongly oppressed.</p><br/><p>The Lord General Cong Hui made countless outstanding military achievements in his lifetime, dedicating his life to the country. He was unmarried his whole life, and it is said that to be due to the death of his lover on the battlefield. He spent the rest of his life in remembrance of the other, defending the country. It is also because this country is something for which his lover exchanged his life.</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/><br/><p>Xue Ling rolled his eyes, speechless, \u201cWho gave him theguts, calling me his lover. \u201c</p><br/><p>The little fox wrapped around Xue Ling\u2019s neck and yawned.\u201cIt was written by the historian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ling snorted, what a coward, he waited for two months, evenuntil death, he didn't hear a word from the other side. He even thought thatthe task he had left behind would not be completed, did not expect that CongHui was restrained() to such an extent, a ** world protagonist gong, shouldn'tthey make a move right away if they like a person?! </p><br/><p>Although he had been ready to reject him in a just andhonest way even if he confessed, so that he would think about him for life andnever get married.</p><br/><p>Well, it seems that the task has been completed now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHost has done a good job this time, and the twoprotagonists\u2019 luck has been accepted. Do you want to start the next world?</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cEn, let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ling\u2019s EQ is not low, he can guess that Cong Hui has thoughtstowards him, but he himself didn't have any feelings at all. In fact, he has noheart, he is indifferent, unfeeling, some things he has seen too much of, it'sdifficult to make his heart move.</p><br/><p>Especially Cong Hui that kind of repressed man.</p><br/><p>Xue Ling\u2019s figure soon disappeared from this patch of space,and another figure strode forward.</p><br/><p>His gaze were somewhat obscure and difficult to see through.A voice came from the darkness. \u201cDo you still want to follow and gotogether?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn't it just that you're worried?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to take a vacation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Do as you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the next world that he is going to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know, why, you want to pick a role?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlways being targeted by you, naturally it's unpleasant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you blaming me again, you can't controlyourself and you're still blaming me, ha-ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking nonsense, send me over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/><br/><p>When Xue Ling opened his eyes again, it was to a screen ofwhite. His body's state was not as bad as last time, just lying on a sofa.Standing up, he looked around, it should be a lounge or something similar.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a tuxedo, which should be the the trappingsfor a performance. Xue Ling turned a full circle, then spoke to the little foxthat was running all over the lounge, \u201cGive me the plot.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little fox shook his tail and said, \u201cHost shouldlie down first.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is a modern world, the story could be regarded as 'goldenphoenix flying out of the mountain nest' type story with a phoenix man risingup in the world.

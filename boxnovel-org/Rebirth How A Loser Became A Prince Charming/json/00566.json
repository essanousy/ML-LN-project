Have I taken pictures of you in the past?\" Julia asked him.</p><br/><p>Maybe I met him on the street while I was taking photos.</p><br/><p>Smiling, Qin Guan told her sincerely, \"Don't mess with me. You are the nymph from the chatroom. You said that you wanted to have sex with me. You kept teasing me!\"</p><br/><p>Julia smiled at his words. \"You must have mistaken me for someone else.\"</p><br/><p>Her words were like a lightning striking Qin Guan's head.</p><br/><p>\"Quick! Zoom in on his face!\" Nichols urged the cameraman.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's face covered the whole camera. His mouth was wide open in shock.</p><br/><p>As a confident man though, he could never admit that he had made a fool of himself before a beautiful woman. He just turned around and said, \"Liar! You were chatting with me!\"</p><br/><p>Julia smiled. The charming woman was not a classic beauty. Her big mouth was actually ugly.</p><br/><p>It was her confidence and good acting skills that attracted everyone. Larry was attracted to her as well. Her smile shocked him, making him get lost in it.</p><br/><p>They had met each other through a beautiful mistake. Her splendid smile had brought them together.</p><br/><p>They went out of the aquarium and walked to the riverbank, a damp wind blowing around them.</p><br/><p>\"Can I take a picture of you?\"</p><br/><p>\"I look bad in pictures.\" Qin Guan declined awkwardly. The aggressive man looked cute though.</p><br/><p>\"\u03a4oday is my birthday.\"</p><br/><p>No one could deny such a request.</p><br/><p>Captivated by her smile, Qin Guan\u2019s eyes softened immediately.</p><br/><p>\"One minute...\" Qin Guan walked over to the pedlar, who was selling tourist souvenirs. \"Give me a dolphin balloon!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a careful man. After talking to her for a while, he had discovered her love for fish.</p><br/><p>Julia\u2019s eyes filled with delight as she accepted the small blue dolphin.</p><br/><p> \"Happy birthday!\" Qin Guan told her.</p><br/><p>Sometimes love didn't need luxurious gifts or dramatic gestures. An accidental touch was enough to express that simple emotion.</p><br/><p>People said that true love was hard to find in a materialistic society, but a simple gesture was able to move one\u2019s heart. Only grumpy people covered their eyes before such beauty.</p><br/><p> If only they stopped complaining and calmed down, they would discover the beauty around them. Maybe the right person was standing right across from them with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>The warm, sweet wind lingered around them. Even the dirty Thames seemed beautiful to them now.</p><br/><p>Nichols used the slow-motion effect. Everyone around the couple moved slowly, as if they were puppets. Only Qin Guan and Julia moved normally.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s second scene ended.</p><br/><p>The whole crew was over the moon. They had cooperated very efficiently, thus avoiding any extra work. Now they could finish work before the deadline set by the company and the producers.</p><br/><p>The price of the contract would remain the same if they finished filming in advance. That was why the crew was concentrating so hard on the whole process.</p><br/><p>\"One-hour break! Good work, everyone! We can shoot another scene in the afternoon. Let\u2019s have lunch now!\"</p><br/><p>There were many small tourist restaurants along Thames. They could have lunch there fast and then move on to the next shooting location.</p><br/><p>\"What are your plans for lunch?\" Qin Guan asked Julia politely.</p><br/><p>Julia abandoned her team without hesitation. \"Wanna have lunch together?\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay! How long have you been in London? Have you tried fish and chips yet?\"</p><br/><p>Julia grimaced. \"You mean the worst food in the world? The British love it because it\u2019s their only choice.\"</p><br/><p>It seemed like she hadn\u2019t tried it.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled and pointed to a small snack shop not far away. \"Wait a moment. My nose is the best radar for delicious food!\"</p><br/><p>When one thought of British food, fish and chips always came to mind first. The famous dish couldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Chinese dishes, but one needed to try it anyway...</p><br/><p>Everyone had been there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

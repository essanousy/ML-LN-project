He just retracted his sceptre and fell into deep thought. This was not worth his attention.</p><br/><p>He acted like he'd just flicked an ant from his clothes and continued along his way, not caring about the creature's sorrow.</p><br/><p>The chair began to descend slowly. Before it reached the floor, the wire pulled him up and he moved down leisurely. His tiptoes touched the sparkling stage before he turned around and disappeared without making any eye contact.</p><br/><p>The background music suddenly stopped. Chris climbed off the floor and struck a lively pose before the audience.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Pure white feathers fell from above, the splendid scene putting an end to the show. Satisfied by the spectacle, the audience clapped hard. This was a big honor for the performers.</p><br/><p>The audience members bought bouquets and flower baskets for the actors. The curtain fell down. The next show was about to begin.</p><br/><p>Actresses were dancing and singing happily to ease the atmosphere and comfort the nervous audience. Backstage, the stylist was busy applying a deep cleansing oil to Qin Guan's body.</p><br/><p>\"I'll clean it as much as I can, but you have to be careful when you bathe at home. At first, your skin will be more yellow than it was before. It will take a few baths with essential oil for the paint to be completely removed.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded casually, not taking his advice seriously. On the way to Cong Nianwei's competition though, his girlfriend kept making fun of his skin.</p><br/><p>He had to get some kind of treatment immediately.</p><br/><p>The show also aired on TV in Nevada and made the headlines of the newspapers with the largest circulation in the country. Chris' team was very good at handling publicity.</p><br/><p>The high attendance and gifts from the audience covered the expenses of the whole tour. As a special guest, Qin Guan would get one percent of the total ticket income, excluding the fixed appearance fee.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan earned 50,000 dollars for the ten-minute show. Plus, he also enjoyed some free publicity.</p><br/><p>He had become a trend-setter in the fashion circle. His performance had created more options for models. Thanks to the development of technology, all industries and performances had to keep up with the times. Otherwise, they would be weeded out.</p><br/><p>The TV show host shouted at the camera excitedly after watching the thrilling fight between Qin Guan and Chris.</p><br/><p>\"That was a real performance! It touched my soul right to the core. Qin Guan deserves all his acting awards! Those arrogant Hollywood stars should be ashamed! They waste such good resources on producing trashy films. If you can't do your job, let that Chinese man take over!\"</p><br/><p>Americans liked irony, but being an Asian was actually a shortcoming for Qin Guan. If he had been American, he would have received countless scripts after winning an award at Cannes. Instead, the investors had waited and observed the success of his two films.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a broad-minded guy, so he was not annoyed by that. He knew that if he returned to the embrace of his motherland, countless scripts would be waiting for him.</p><br/><p>Before he could finish reading the news reports, the bus had reached their destination. It was the house assigned to Cong Nianwei's team. That day, the organizing committee would announce the winner.</p><br/><p>Competitors arrived one after the other. This was the final round, so they were all capable and experienced.</p><br/><p>The architectural industry was very strict and precise. Cong Nianwei's partners seemed much younger than the other competitors. Everyone in the room was dressed formally. Even Qin Guan, who was an insider of the fashion circle, was treated like an official.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

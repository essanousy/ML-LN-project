Then he covered Cong Nianwei's mouth with a scarf to finish off her cool outfit.</p><br/><p>\"Our car has broken down,\" he explained slowly. \"Our new car is on its way. I bought it from Bu Qinglu. Isn't that cool? Young people in the capital love this model. It's everyone's favorite toy. Just look at the back!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei got on the trembling sidecar helplessly and craned her neck to look at the back of the motorcycle. The plate spelled \"A521521\". The black letters stood out against the yellow background.</p><br/><p>\"I see. So what?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei got in the sidecar. She was surprised to see that the leather seat was steady and comfortable, even though it had no cover. The motorcycle shook again as she took a seat. She immediately lost her favorable impression of their new vehicle.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan climbed on the motorcycle, put on his black gloves and gave Cong Nianwei a thumbs-up.</p><br/><p>\"This is a special motorcycle. It's not allowed in the capital, but Guan Jian helped me bring one. While you were away, Bu and I went to the bar street next to Tsinghua University. Guess who came to talk to us about the motorcycle?\"</p><br/><p>\"Who?\" It must have been some lazy person.</p><br/><p>\"Gao Xiaosong. He was also born into a military family. Unlike Guan Jian and He Ming though, he graduated from Tsinghua University and studied science and art. He is a good man. He was not arrogant by any means. He hugged me, called me brother and said he wanted to buy the motorcycle.\"</p><br/><p>Okay, whatever. Cong Nianwei shot a disdainful look at him. Qin Guan turned his eyes to the front with dignity. \"I'm not an idiot. He wanted nothing from me. He just became my brother! Let's go!\"</p><br/><p>The motorcycle drove away with a roar, leaving thick smoke in the empty parking lot behind it. That explained why the police chased those motorcycles around the streets. They were a big source of pollution for the environment.</p><br/><p>The cold wind made Cong Nianwei long for a leather coat. No wonder bikers wore leather outfits. Only leather clothes could withstand such a chilly wind.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was excited about the car, even more so when he noticed the girls' admiration on the way.</p><br/><p>\"That's so cool, bro!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hush!\"</p><br/><p>They all wolf-whistled at him. In their opinion, both the motorcycle and the rider looked really cool. Cong Nianwei had no idea what was on their minds.</p><br/><p>After going through half the city in that cold wind, they finally reached their new offices. The building was a three-storey residential house in Shuangjing.</p><br/><p>It had originally been an office building, but Qin Guan had turned it into a house with a mix of oriental and occidental influences. The rusty buildings under construction around it made it seem like a palace in comparison.</p><br/><p>Its white walls, blue roof, carved beams and Chinese rafters added elegance to it. Qin Guan had divided the building into three parts.</p><br/><p>On the east wing was Qin Guan's studio, where he would deal with models, designers and film and TV scripts, on the central wing was the accounting firm's offices, and the west wing would be turned into Cong Nianwei's studio in the future.</p><br/><p>The whole building was big enough for both their firms. It was even enough for a branch. Cong Nianwei got out of the sidecar and rushed towards the new beginning of her career. She had no time to complain about Qin Guan's antics.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took off his helmet, glasses and scarf slowly and then went into the building. Talented graduates from his alma mater were shuttling around the firm's offices. The young men were all very reliable and hard-working employees.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the overtime pay, they were all able to forget about food and sleep and deal with every order. Sometimes they even stayed there all night. The abundant overtime salary and night cab fares were the real reason behind their efficiency. There was also a clear hierarchy in the firm, so everyone was trying to get a promotion.</p><br/><p>The firm encouraged the staff to apply for higher level accountant positions and take the relative examinations.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The cover would be a large portrait, so Linn would capture only Qin Guan's face and neck. This naturally made things more difficult for the stylist.</p><br/><p>Chris Sortleon, who cooperated with Linn very frequently, had been offered the job. She was considered the best stylist in America. Most of her clients were politicians, so she had never worked in the fashion circle.</p><br/><p>Unlike her peers in the fashion circle, she looked like a politician herself rather than a stylist.</p><br/><p>During the presidential election, she was invited by CNN to help the candidates of the two parties. She was good and prompt at her job. Three minutes were usually all she needed. The stylist was never disrespectful at such important occasions.</p><br/><p>That was why she had gotten the job.</p><br/><p>Chris had graduated from the South New Hampshire University with a degree in Commercial Management, but she seldom worked for people outside the political circle.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan walked in, she realized why Linn had invited her there. The young man was a muse for both photographers and stylists. He was a source of inspiration for all artists. Everyone would be happy to meet him.</p><br/><p>Chris changed her attitude and adjusted her chair to match his height.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan greeted the stylist politely. She was only wearing a pearl necklace. A pair of soft hands welcomed him.</p><br/><p>There were no calluses on her hands. They felt smooth and very warm. This was essential for a good stylist, so models would not be repulsed by their touch.</p><br/><p>Chris studied Qin Guan before she sighed and murmured to herself, \"His skin is perfect and his face is flawless! It was not a legend after all. Does this mean that I have to compete with Pat over a job at the fashion week?\"</p><br/><p>Chris shook her head. \"No, this must be an exception. Models that live wild lives are not as fresh and bright as they seem.\"</p><br/><p>She turned on all the lights to check Qin Guan's face more carefully.</p><br/><p>\"TIME tends to choose a red or blue frame for the person on their cover. Only deceased people get a black frame. You are too fair-skinned for a serious magazine though. TIME is very different from fashion magazines.\"</p><br/><p>\"We need some proper foundation...\" she murmured as she got to work. She mixed several shades of foundation and compared the result to the back of her hand.</p><br/><p>\"Perfect! Antique brass will make you look more sophisticated and masculine. That's what old-fashioned readers like to see.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan relaxed at her joke as her soft brush swiped across his cheeks, forehead and jaw.</p><br/><p>Chris took a breath. \"Oh, honey... Never smile at a woman like that.\"</p><br/><p>The brush made Qin Guan feel itchy, so he just closed his eyes and smiled.</p><br/><p>\"There's no need for any blush or lipstick. Your lips are very moist. There's nothing else for me to do. I should just apply some toner to your face.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Let me brush your eyebrows out, my boy...\"</p><br/><p>Qu was smirking. Qin Guan's face required no work compared to the wrinkly faces of old politicians.</p><br/><p>Soon, Chris waved Qin Guan away. \"Okay, go to the studio before I do something else to impress the readers.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan escaped as fast as he could. He felt wronged by her professional skill, but that was not his fault, was it?</p><br/><p>An assistant led him into the professional studio. A portrait photo was just a trifle for the team, but Linn had still organized all their resources based on that. In Qin Guan's opinion, the old man was very serious about his job. Linn thought just as highly of him.</p><br/><p>Dear everyone, here is the new book of Kiki, my lovely editors.

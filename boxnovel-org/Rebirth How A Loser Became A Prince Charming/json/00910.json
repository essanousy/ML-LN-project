The film would be shot in real locations in New York.</p><br/><p>This basically meant that a no-man zone would be created on the bustling Washington Square amid a city with a population of more than 10 million. It would take unimaginable manpower and resources to achieve this.</p><br/><p>The Brooklyn Bridge would also be blocked. Almost 1,000 figurants would be participating in the film. The crew had even borrowed all kinds of weapons and aircraft from the army.</p><br/><p>The producers had submitted applications to 14 different government departments, including the New York municipal government, to get approval. One million dollars had vanished overnight. That was why the budget of the film was 150 million.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was under great pressure, especially when the crew brought in a German shepherd. Qin Guan forced a smile at the dog.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a miracle took place.</p><br/><p>The strictly-trained army dog wasn't hostile towards him. It just looked down at him.</p><br/><p>Yes, it looked down at him.</p><br/><p>Dogs were a close relative of wolves. In each wolf pack there could only be one alpha. The old dog considered itself the alpha as soon as it met Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Thus, no tragedy occured when Qin Guan got close to the dog. The alpha even allowed Qin Guan to pet the hair on its back.</p><br/><p>\"Good! It has accepted you,\" the trainer told Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled the happiest smile he had in 2007. Does this mean that animals no longer detest me? Could I get a pet for Cong Nianwei?</p><br/><p>Just as he fell in deep thought, the director asked everyone to get into position. The crew began filming amid the early New York spring.</p><br/><p>Ford Motor had invested a lot in the production. The company was in charge of all the cars that would appear in the film. The audience would not be averse to such a product placement, as the gorgeous cars would add elegance to the film.</p><br/><p>That day, Ford Motor brought its latest sports car, the GT500. The car was shining red, which added glamor to the depressing setting.</p><br/><p>It would be Qin Guan's car during the scene. Only such a high-functioning sports car would be able to chase deer in that complicated urban terrain.</p><br/><p>Deer? Yes, a bunch of lively deer.</p><br/><p>The square was closed for the afternoon. All the neon lights had been turned off, and the prop team had decorated all the streets in the area with artificial weeds.</p><br/><p>The crew had spent a lot in order to create an apocalyptic world without normal human beings and a collapsing, decaying city.</p><br/><p>Wild animals had occupied the city when their natural enemy had left. They had instinctively scoped out the area before invading it.</p><br/><p>Of course, all the credit belonged to the prop team, which had bought a bunch of deer from a farm that specialized in deer breeding. The deer included a strong leader and some young.</p><br/><p>The crew would only have six evenings to finish filming on the square, so they couldn't waste any time.</p><br/><p>According to the script, Qin Guan would have to chase after the animals in the car until he disappeared from the frame. Suddenly, the assistant director ran over to Lawrence and told him there was an emergency.</p><br/><p>The square had been barricaded, but there was a crowd around the barricades that extended in all directions.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's fans had heard about the barricaded area and gathered there to cheer on their idol. Some fans had even travelled there from other states or counties.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

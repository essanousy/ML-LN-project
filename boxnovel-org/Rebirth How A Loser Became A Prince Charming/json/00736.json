The melody, along with Xu's soft voice-over, lingered around the set.</p><br/><p>The voice-over had been finished the previous night, so Qin Guan and Li Pingping knew about it in advance.</p><br/><p>\"That's when I fell in love with you. I know that many women have said that to you, but believe me, no woman has ever loved you like me. There is no alternative for me. Nothing in the world could compare to my love for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"It was a hopeless, humble outburst of enthusiasm, but from then on, you had captured my heart.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had actually been harboring the same love. Unlike the miserable heroine though, he pursued it without hesitation and finally succeeded.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed in sympathy for the character, all the while remaining speechless about his own character.</p><br/><p>The man was an innocent guy feeling a secret adoration. He was a playboy who just played the game of love. Some people couldn't afford to do that though.</p><br/><p>The food in Wang's hands made him cheer up again after the shooting.</p><br/><p>\"Here's your late snack, Brother Qin!\"</p><br/><p>The fictional girl's sorrow was finally blown away. Qin Guan felt refreshed again, and so did Xu, who cast away her sorrow and got to work energetically.</p><br/><p>The first love of a maiden withered in time, but the romantic feelings of a young woman bloomed silently.</p><br/><p>After moving away from the yard, Xu returned to the old alley and rented a house across the yard to be closer to her lover.</p><br/><p>The girl had grown up and become slim and graceful. Lin Yuan left the filming location when it was time for Qin Guan and Xu Jinglei's scene. Would the soft, gentle woman be a good partner for Qin Guan? Everyone was waiting to find out.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they had all misjudged Qin Guan. He was actually better than Xu in the field of Chinese history and traditional culture. He had not stopped his lessons with Teacher Rong, even while he was in America, so it was easy for him to portray an uninhibited scholar living in the era of the Republic of China.</p><br/><p>A student demonstration was taking place in the embassy district of the city. Xu was a schoolgirl holding a sign, while Qin Guan was a reporter carrying a camera.</p><br/><p>When they brushed against each other, the policemen started dispersing the demonstrating crowd. Qin Guan immediately rushed up to the girl he was interested in. The two of them ran through the familiar alleys hand in hand. Li Pingping ran after them excitedly with the camera.</p><br/><p>The couple chose a deserted church as a temporary shelter. Now that they were away from danger, they were finally able to fix their eyes on each other. Qin Guan, who was wearing golden-framed glasses and a black windcoat, was still holding the girl's hands.</p><br/><p>When he saw the amused expression in her eyes, he let her slender fingers go awkwardly. The smell of roses lingered on his palms.</p><br/><p>All he could do was smile at her and express his tenderness and love through his eyes. The narrow space suddenly filled with an ambiguous emotion.</p><br/><p>If this were an occidental film, they would have gotten naked by now. The lovers lived in a conservative country though, so they just stared at each other emotionally.</p><br/><p>This was why occidental critics were puzzled by oriental romance. Asians were born with a feeling of restraint that was beyond the understanding of people that confused love with desire.</p><br/><p>How could they understand the gentle, hesitant feeling in the girl's eyes?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Xu cooperated perfectly during that short minute. They actually seemed to understand each other like old friends.</p><br/><p>When the scene was over, Xu hugged Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much for participating in the film despite its limited budget. It was such great luck to have you here.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan patted her shoulder in an effort to comfort the sensitive woman.</p><br/><p>\"You are welcome, Director Xu. Don't forget that I'm also a fan of yours. I really like your film. Next scene, quick! We need to save money!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

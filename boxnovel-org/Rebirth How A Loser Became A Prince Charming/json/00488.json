She attracted his attention immediately.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s so beautiful! Qian Caiwang glanced at his Korean girlfriend, who kept complaining about the boring conference. Suddenly, he felt depressed. After her cosmetic surgery, her face looks worse. </p><br/><p>Qian looked at the goddess again and saw that she was in the corridor, away from her group.</p><br/><p>It's a wonderful chance! I\u2019m going!</p><br/><p>He pushed the hands locked on his arm away. \"Wait a minute.\" Then he rushed out of the office.</p><br/><p>After taking a few steps, he found the girl looking at the scene outside attentively, her arms folded over her chest.</p><br/><p>The perfect opportunity! </p><br/><p>Qian fixed his tie and walked towards her with the steadiest steps he had ever taken in his life. He tried to chat with Cong Nianwei in an unnatural manner.</p><br/><p>\"Hello?\"</p><br/><p>No response.</p><br/><p>\"Are you Chinese? Me too! It must be destiny\u2026 Are you studying at Columbia? Fabulous! I have a design company and I think Chinese people should help each other.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you interested in working for my company after graduating? We can talk about the salary. You\u2019ll be satisfied with my offer...\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei raised her eyebrows and sized Qian up from head to toe.</p><br/><p>She remembered the Asian man in the office. His design was quite straight and narrow, with some small flaws. Without an advantage in price, it would definitely be weeded out during the selecting process. She wondered why the man was smiling.</p><br/><p>His pond was too small to hold a shark like Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>Qian was excited that he had her attention. He tried to get a little closer. She smells great!</p><br/><p>\"May I know your name? What are you looking at? Is there anything interesting in this commercial district? Tell me. I\u2019ll buy it for you as a gift.\"</p><br/><p>Everything can be settled with a handbag of high-end merchandise. Qian smiled proudly, and so did Cong Nianwei. She pointed to something outside the window with her slender finger. \"I like him. Buy him for me!\"</p><br/><p>Qian looked happily in that direction. \"Let me see. What attracted my beauty? Don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll buy...\"</p><br/><p>He paused in shock.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Qu Xuemei were walking from the site to a restaurant. Qin Guan planned on picking up Cong Nianwei on the way.</p><br/><p>Qian looked at Qu, who was slowly walking towards him. The woman had a mature charm to her. Her self-confidence and power were her most attractive points.</p><br/><p>If she was wearing black high heels, leather skinny pants and a mask and held a whip in her hand...</p><br/><p>Qian shivered, trying not to drool. \"How much for the woman? You like her? Are you a lesbian?\" he asked unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Before his voice could fade away, Qin Guan and Qu reached the corridor.</p><br/><p>\"A lesbian? Shall we go for lunch, Cong Nianwei?\" Qin Guan's voice broke up Qian\u2019s dream. Only then did he realize that there was a man standing beside the two beauties.</p><br/><p>It was rare for Qin Guan, who was always in the spotlight, to be ignored. Qian\u2019s thirst for women was to blame.</p><br/><p>The man was shocked. He opened his mouth wide and pointed to Qin Guan with a heavy arm and a shaking finger.</p><br/><p>\"Qin\u2026 Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's me. Do you know me?\"</p><br/><p>At his confirmation, Qian pointed to the two women with shaking fingers again. \"Which one is your girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hugged Cong Nianwei around the shoulders. \"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>Qian retreated right away, as if Cong Nianwei had the plague. \"Is she the female tiger? Is she the arch criminal keeping you from other women? She must be a martial artist!\"</p><br/><p>What are you talking about?</p><br/><p>They were all confused. Qian began to explain excitedly.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m also a member of the luxury car club. I have long admired the four founders. Lan Jin is my best friend.\"</p><br/><p>He gave him a thumbs up before he continued proudly, \"The legend of you four has spread around the circle of Chinese young artists. Your Excellency is the most mysterious.\"</p><br/><p> \"I have seen many of your advertisements, but never you in person. Lan has told me so much about you. You are...\" He gave him a thumbs up again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They considered the Berlin Film Festival to be very fair and prestigious, so they tried their best to pull Qin Guan to their own camp.</p><br/><p>\"The Berlin Film Festival was the first to open in 2004. Its hasty beginning didn't harm its content by any means\" - The New York Times</p><br/><p>\"Good films attract public attention in every country, but Berlin favors Qin Guan. His second award was very easy to get...\" - The Los Angeles Times</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's character was outstanding compared to indie film characters from other countries. Everyone could see that, even if indie films were not their expertise.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the newsstand owner, Qin Guan didn't find any negative feedback about his performance. Considering the evaluation of the mainstream media, he could look forward to even more positive responses.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put down the last magazine and gave the eager man a bill.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks a lot. One copy of TIME.\"</p><br/><p>This was a milestone for him, so he needed a souvenir.</p><br/><p>The man waved away the bill, as if he was insulted by it.</p><br/><p>\"Why would you pay me?\"</p><br/><p>Why not? You are a businessman, not a philanthropist. Plus, I'm not a robber. </p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan understood and smiled at the man. Then he took out his phone and stood right next to him.</p><br/><p>\"Come on! Look at the camera! Three, two, one\u2026 Cheese!\"</p><br/><p>Their faces were captured in the photo for eternity.</p><br/><p>\"I'll upload it to my blog. I can send it to you by email.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, okay!\"</p><br/><p>The man came back to his senses and gave Qin Guan his email excitedly. I'll be your loyal fan from now on.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the man saw a small piece of paper shoved in another copy of TIME. He spread it and saw that it was a five-dollar bill. That was the exact price of the magazine.</p><br/><p>He put the cash in his pocket with misty eyes. He would save it for his collection.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned home in a good mood and sent the photo to his firm. Then he got a short message from Sister Qu, telling him that his community service ad had been broadcast on every TV station in New York.</p><br/><p> Thanks to its social impact, the City Hall and the New York Police decided to give Qin Guan a Community Service Innovation Award in 2004. He was not the first Asian to get a medal from the City Hall or the police, but this was the first time he would be getting an award that was irrelevant to the fashion and entertainment industry.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to share this honor with the person closest to him.</p><br/><p>\"Aren't you happy when you are able to help others, Wei? People like and admire me, which makes me really happy.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was surprised. Does this mean that he will engage in charity now?</p><br/><p>Reading her expression, Qin Guan hastened to add, \"No, no! There are all kinds of charity. Donations are useful, but personal labor is even better. I like being needed!\"</p><br/><p>He was still a money-grubber.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei adjusted her posture on the couch and replied casually, \"It won't be hard. You are a public figure now, so more and more charities will approach you after this advertisement. Thanks to your social status, your face attracts donations. Don't worry, the money will just start flowing in.\"</p><br/><p>\"You could have a talk with your agent though. If your schedule allows it, you could accept more voluntary work.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. Cong Nianwei's next words strengthened his resolve.</p><br/><p>\"Besides, this will make you even more popular. Community service ads are much more relatable than luxury product ads. You could show off your personal charm that way.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was happy with Cong Nianwei's plan. His girlfriend could conquer the world with her high IQ. Qin Guan kissed Cong Nianwei on the face as a commercial break started on TV.</p><br/><p>After an unscrupulous bombing of commercial ads, Qin Guan's first public-interest ad aired.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Meet me in our dormitory!\"</p><br/><p>Before the fans could surround him completely, Qin Guan had run away in his slippers.</p><br/><p>The girls focused on Liu Xiaoyang and Ye Dong, who were too slow to react.</p><br/><p>Sparks flied. \"That's mine!\"</p><br/><p>\"Go away!\" After pushing and shoving, they made the girls leave.</p><br/><p>Ye Dong sighed in relief. \"Great! We\u2019re all safe now.\"</p><br/><p>They had messy hair and clear scratches on their hands and necks. Liu told Ye Dong miserably, \"Safe? Are you blind? I was robbed just now. All of Qin Guan\u2019s things were taken. There\u2019s nothing left!\" The collar of his fleece was torn.</p><br/><p>His roommates hugged his shoulders, comforting him as they headed to their dormitory. \"We\u2019ll watch the match in our dormitory.\"</p><br/><p>Around the corner, Mou Xiaoliu, who was observing the situation, asked Huang Jiajia apprehensively, \"Why did you urge them to chase Qin Guan? The more competitors, the less hope you\u2019ll have...\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia cast a disdainful look at her. She lost interest and headed to the cafeteria with Mou.</p><br/><p>\"Mind your own business! He doesn't care about me. but I\u2019ll be happy to cause him trouble. You are my friend. Why are you taking his side?\" They disappeared at the end of the corridor.</p><br/><p>...\u2026</p><br/><p>The boys had no idea who the main culprit was. Only when they returned to their dormitory and turned on their newly-installed TV did Qin Guan recall that he had missed countless matches during the National Day holiday.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team would definitely qualify. If they won that day, they would also qualify in advance. Qin Gun sat down on a chair without worries, enjoying Liu\u2019s massage as an apology. They\u2019re just possessions. I\u2019m a rich man! The Adidas body wash gift is enough to last all my roommates for half a year.</p><br/><p>The match ended. China won with a score of 1:0. They were all trembling with excitement. Loud cheers filled the whole corridor.</p><br/><p>Big red subtitles were occupying the whole screen: We Qualified!</p><br/><p>CCTV was always a strict, serious channel, but that rule-breaking subtitle was expressing the delight of fans all over the country.</p><br/><p>Some crazy boys began to sing the national anthem at the top of their voices. Students emerged from different doors, trying to express their joy and satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Wang Lei, who was renowned for his calmness, was flushed. Liu jumped down from his bed and shouted, \"Long live the Chinese team! Long live the World Cup!\"</p><br/><p>He began to ransack Ye Dong\u2019s stuff, his roommates looking at him doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\" Liu took out a folded national flag and spread it with both hands.</p><br/><p>\"Long live the Chinese team!\" he said, rushing out into the ocean of happiness.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan covered his face and shouted, \"Wait! Wait! Do you want to show your penis to everyone? Don\u2019t you feel cold in some places?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang blinked and tried to arrange his pants. Ye Dong shouted at him, \"Put down the flag! What do you want to do with it?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan handed him a pair of slacks. \"Be careful! You\u2019ll be 19 next year. You\u2019ve been four years in college, you are no longer a little boy. We\u2019re still taking care of you. You should learn some survival skills.\"</p><br/><p>Liu put on his slacks happily and went down the stairs with his babysitters.</p><br/><p>It was the moment innumerable fans had been looking forward to. Young guys would be waiting with a vague hope from then on...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no time to reminiscence in sorrow. He had to finish his thesis during his senior year, so he\u2019d spent all his spare time on work.</p><br/><p>After Zhuchuan\u2019s decision, the advertising group from Japan had come straight to China. As workaholics, they spent all their spare time on work.</p><br/><p>They had to explore the way carefully before entering the market of a foreign country.</p><br/><p>In order to help, Qin Guan introduced A.M. to Citizen, which made the director overjoyed.</p><br/><p>A client like Citizen would not just bring a large income, but also big honor.</p><br/><p>The temporary team worked together effectively and made a detailed plan for the products and the ambassador. After reading the final plan, Qin Guan realized with panic that he would release his first photo album.</p><br/><p>Will someone buy it?</p><br/><p>The Japanese reassured him that in Japan and South Korea people focused more on looks, so the photo album of a handsome guy would sell well.</p><br/><p>To compensate for Qin Guan's poor popularity in Asia, Citizen cooperated with A. M. They contacted different editions of famous fashion magazines in Asia, including VOGUE, ELLE, JJ in Japan, Rayli, and CECI in South Korea, to publish the album together.</p><br/><p>The album would be an additional gift for the magazines. It would be attached to the package, so the audience would see the price clearly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan, who had always been a B level model, turned into an A level model. Magazines wanted to cooperate with him to promote the album, which surprised Yin Yan and Qu Xuemei a lot.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The women of the neighborhood committee saw suspicious men in black suits walk around the alleys every day.</p><br/><p>For the sake of their wives and kids' safety, the men sent their families to stay somewhere else. Then they rolled their sleeves up and organized patrols. There were even night watchmen. The whole situation took everyone back to the times of the Anti-Japanese War.</p><br/><p>When he felt that things were getting out of control, An had sent a short message to Qin Guan. He just wanted to remind the star, whose every movement could make the headlines, not to get involved in this complicated matter. Qin Guan had just returned to China and knew nothing about the situation after all.</p><br/><p>An actually judged people solely on their appearance. He had already met Qin Guan twice, yet he still didn't understand anything about his nature. Unlike most stars, who wanted to protect their reputation, Qin Guan never thought about things like that. He tended to deal with everything in the most simple and direct way. Human kindness was the key to success after all.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hang up the phone excitedly. He was planning on driving his Cherokee to Dongzhimen in his flip flops. When he saw the car though, which was nearly buried in birds' droppings, he realized his current situation.</p><br/><p>The sky was getting darker. It was exactly the time of the day when those mysterious men in black wandered around. Shall I go like this?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked down at his black shirt and loose sweatpants. He was afraid that he might face an unavoidable confrontation. He put his safety first and decided to get dressed before leaving.</p><br/><p>Then he rushed upstairs and called the richest tycoons in the capital.</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu was having a rare day off, so he answered Qin Guan's call excitedly.</p><br/><p>\"You are so brave, bro! Thank you for calling me! I'm your elder brother! Wait right there, I'm coming!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang bounced up from the couch and lifted his arms, shouting at his employees, \"Take your weapons, brothers! No, prepare for a legitimate negotiation!\"</p><br/><p>The two men were on the right side of the tracks now. The night entertainment industry was pretty good. Although they played the edge ball, people called them Boss Bu and Boss Wang at parties, instead of Brother.</p><br/><p>As typical villains, Qin Guan's case made their blood surge.</p><br/><p>Their subordinates were no longer young alley idlers, but the best fighters in the city.</p><br/><p>Everyone got on the company's minibuses. A minibus was the best way to get to know one another when one was holding a steel stick in their hands. It was a gang fight strategy.</p><br/><p>In a few minutes, the four minibuses were ready to go. Bu Qinglu got in one of them and waved at the others. \"Let's get going! Xizhimen!\"</p><br/><p>They roared away, leaving Wenwen in the empty Candy Club parking lot. She stomped on the ground with her high heels.</p><br/><p>\"Bastard! Qin Guan is back! Why didn't you take me along? I knew you were jealous of his looks!\"</p><br/><p>She left gracefully with a flirtish grumble. It seemed like she was living a happy life with her boyfriend.</p><br/><p>The motorcade merged into the traffic like a water drop into the sea. By the time they reached their destination, the traffic jam had calmed their impulses down.</p><br/><p>They all entered Qin Guan's home. After a hasty hug, Qin Guan explained the situation. As alley people, they naturally tended to side with the mass. They were confident about discussing a plan though. Qin Guan was pulled away to Dongzhimen.</p><br/><p>They just travelled around the Second Ring Road that night.</p><br/><p>When they reached the neighborhood, Bu, who was a clever man, led all the cars to a parking lot across the street. Everyone got out of the cars silently and went through the alleys.</p><br/><p>The moon was shining in the summer night sky. There were scarcely any people in the empty alleys that time of the day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

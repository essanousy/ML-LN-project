Sister Xue and Wang Liying didn't reveal his new address to anybody.</p><br/><p>For the sake of the health of the next generation, a pregnant woman couldn't breathe in the polluted air downtown.</p><br/><p>Xiaotangshan was the best hot springs resort in Beijing, so it was everyone's first choice for vacation. Even the princes of the Qing Dynasty had set up their residences there. Modern people certainly knew how to have fun.</p><br/><p>There were sunshine-filled greenhouses and large windows in Qin Guan's villa. People could fish in the river, or enjoy the hot springs and various fruit and vegetables. There was a beautiful rural scenery around.</p><br/><p>Although the villa was in an urban area, it was not isolated. A lot of luxurious villas were located there. The facilities were complete, and peasants living nearby organized bazaars regularly and brought fresh vegetables, so the rich residents could experience the pleasure of living in the countryside.</p><br/><p>That day was a little different. A strange guy went there, attracted by the quality and good prices of the products.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, a reporter from the Beijing Lifestyle Section went over to film and write about that unique place.</p><br/><p>\"As everyone can see, I'm at the center of the Xiaotangshan bazaar. The whole place is bustling with people...\"</p><br/><p>\"Unlike the markets downtown, everyone here uses temporary stands...\"</p><br/><p>\"You can find anything you want here. All the products are fresh and safe... Follow me! Let's find some delicious food!\"</p><br/><p>The camera turned to the stands.</p><br/><p>\"Can you see those big eggs? The chickens are raised by local peasants. Hey, Liu! Film this! My eyes must be fooling me!\"</p><br/><p>Film what? The old woman selling the eggs? The eggs sure look good...</p><br/><p>\"You glutton! I meant the customer!\"</p><br/><p>The camera zoomed in to reveal the man bargaining with the old woman.</p><br/><p>It was Qin Guan, the very man everyone around the world had been searching for. He was wearing black-framed glasses, slippers and a loose shirt, and his hair was as messy as a chicken's nest.</p><br/><p>\"Can I have a discount? No? Can I have the basket for free then? I won't buy the eggs otherwise!\" After a long silence, the old woman surrendered.</p><br/><p>\"You are a good-looking boy, so I'll give you the basket as a gift...\"</p><br/><p>Both the reporter and the cameraman were speechless.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! What a coincidence! Fancy meeting you here! Will you say hi to our viewers?\"</p><br/><p>Wow! I was discovered. Is this a lifestyle channel? That's fine.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved at the camera. \"Hello, everyone. I'm Qin Guan. If you are interested in the bazaar...\" A long introduction followed, one even more detailed than the one the host had made. Qin Guan seemed like an average stay-at-home husband.</p><br/><p>\"You've bought too many vegetables.\"</p><br/><p>\"My wife is pregnant. I'm going to be a dad!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made the sign of victory proudly before the camera.</p><br/><p>Is that really the award-winning actor? The supermodel?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved goodbye at the reporter and left the bazaar on his motorcycle.</p><br/><p>When the bazaar was over, the reporter showed the video to his director, as if he was showing him a rare treasure. That evening, their viewers in Beijing were shocked.</p><br/><p>\"Today, we got a big surprise in Xiaotangshan. We saw Qin Guan! The actor was buying eggs when I spotted him...\"</p><br/><p>The viewers sat stunned before their TVs. They looked just like stone statues. As soon as they came back to their senses, they started calling their friends. \"Turn on the TV! Quick! They found Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's so interesting. What was he doing in Xiaotangshan?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is still handsome, even though he is a stay-at-home husband...\"</p><br/><p>The short clip of Qin Guan was over in one minute, but its influence did not stop there. His fans in Beijing rushed to their computers to tell everyone that Qin Guan had appeared again!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

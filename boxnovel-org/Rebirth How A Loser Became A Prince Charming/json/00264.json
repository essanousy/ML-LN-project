Meanwhile, you can inquire about their shooting schedule. If it doesn\u2019t fit mine, just say no. I\u2019m busy today. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue nodded. I have another sheep to look after. Better keep the goodies within the family.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left her office and went straight to Zhang Zhenqian's company in the East Third Ring.</p><br/><p>That day, the bidding would start.</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu, Wang Hailiang and He Qian were waiting in the office. Zhang did not look nervous at all. He was handing cigars out to everyone.</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry. After drinking together at several parties, we\u2019ve become brothers. We\u2019ll definitely win the bid.\"</p><br/><p>Bu cast a disdainful glance at him. \"Promises made over wine are not reliable. Is your friend trustworthy, Zhang?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang got angry at his words, especially as there was a beautiful partner sitting beside him.</p><br/><p>He bared his teeth. \"Talking is pointless. I\u2019ll show you the results today.\"</p><br/><p>At ten o\u2019clock, the bidding list would be published on the website.</p><br/><p>Everyone was looking at the marketing assistant.</p><br/><p>The young guy kept refreshing the page every minute, waiting for the official announcement.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes after the given time, the website was finally updated. The long list of the winning companies was on the page.</p><br/><p>In one day, written notices would be sent out by post mail, including the delivery address, payment method, receiving point and other essential information.</p><br/><p>Then the temporary company would be able to function normally.</p><br/><p>Of course, first they would celebrate their success. The assistant gave the list to Zhang Zhenqian\u2019s secretary.</p><br/><p>Everyone was eager to read it. \"What about our bids?\"</p><br/><p>\"Take it easy. We have to compare them to our offer to calculate our profit.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan read through the list from the very beginning silently. Then he said happily, \"Don't bother. We won 10 bids this time. We bid for 17, so the winning rate is 58.8%. Brother Zhang wasn\u2019t exaggerating.\"</p><br/><p>\"There are 54 kinds of equipment in total, and we got 10 of them. They are all small parts with low profits though. We\u2019ll get about 10,000,000 as a net margin.\"</p><br/><p>\"After splitting it according to the equity ratio, He Qian will get 4,000,000, Brother Zhang will get 1,400,000, and each of us will get 2,000,000. It's all clear.\"</p><br/><p>The others were watching Qin Guan in shock. He was spilling out numbers like it was no big deal.</p><br/><p>\"The profit of the generator system will be 127,636.28 yuan, and profit of the machinery will be...\"</p><br/><p>As he calculated the final number, the cigar fell from Zhang's hand.</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu and Wang Hailiang looked like they had looked Medusa in the eye. They stared at Qin Guan like stupefied, with their mouths and eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>He Qian remained calm before her idol. In her mind, Qin Guan was perfect in all aspects.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt embarrassed by their looks. \"Sorry, I\u2019m just gifted with numbers.\"</p><br/><p>If you are gifted with numbers, then students studying mathematics should just give up!</p><br/><p>Soon, they went back to being happy and productive. All their faces radiated with joy. They could foresee a good beginning. The small company would rise and develop thanks to their strategy.</p><br/><p>After he left work, Qin Guan enjoyed some leisure time. He read scripts at the teahouse of the Fuhua Plaza while drinking a cup of mocha.</p><br/><p>As soon as he\u2019d gotten the scripts, he had called Zhang Jizhong to express his appreciation. He had accepted a role in \"Demi-Gods and Demi-Demons\" without hesitation. He had announced that he wouldn't accept a villain\u2019s role again though.</p><br/><p>He thought deeply about the part in \"Dragon Buster\", which was not directed by Zhang, but he didn't want to accept the role of Song Qingshu. The salary wasn\u2019t that good and it was an annoying character. He just felt like something was missing from Song, unlike his previous roles.</p><br/><p>Song is short for \"obsession\". Zhang Changzhong had been obsessed with his brother's kindness, Yang Lianting had been obsessed with Dongfang's love, and Gao Fuming had been obsessed with his former master. They\u2019d all had a reasonable obsession with something.</p><br/><p>Song had a forced obsession with love though. He seemed to be obsessed with obsession itself. He would give up his family and career for a woman, which was not reasonable.</p><br/><p>Despite his deep love for Cong Nianwei, Qin Guan wouldn\u2019t have behaved like Song. People didn\u2019t live just for others. He would never give something up just for love.</p><br/><p>Besides, if he was Song Qingshu, he wouldn\u2019t have won Cong Nianwei's heart. Cong Nianwei was a clever girl, so she would have sensed his nature.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a sigh and put the script in his large bag. The hand-made nubuck bag was a gift from Cong Nianwei. It had excellent quality and a reasonable price.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

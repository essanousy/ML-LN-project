He is both tall and handsome. He really is a strong man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls began to talk while they looked at Qin Guan eagerly. We\u2019re still fans of yours. Who said that our prince couldn't dance? Come out. We promise not to beat you to death.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got quite famous overnight, giving life to countless legends at the university ball.</p><br/><p>Some people insisted that he had been the first universally accepted dancing god in the whole university, others claimed that there had been countless dancing girls worshipping him, and some people believed that Qin Guan was paranormally powerful.</p><br/><p>That night, he earned a new title, that of the \u201cChilde of the Ball\u201d. He was also holding two more titles, \u201cthe straight-A boy from the Accounting Department\u201d and \u201cthe most handsome freshman\u201d.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about the gossip. It was true that the person involved was always the last one to hear the rumours circulating about them.</p><br/><p>At the time, he was pretending to be a QH University student so he could share a class with Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>The class was about indoor design.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei hit him under the desk and asked in low voice, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was innocent. He covered his head with a book as he answered, \u201cIt has been a long time since I last saw you. I\u2019ve been missing you a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>He held her hand and closed his eyes as he lay down on the desk. \u201cListen to the professor. I won't bother you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei tried to pull her hand out, but failed. She could do nothing but look ahead and pay attention.</p><br/><p>Had this been after the year 2000, an article would have been posted on the Tianya Forum, titled \u201cWhat can I do about my clingy boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Faced with Qin Guan's shameless smile, Cong Nianwei just listened to the professor helplessly. Her best friends looked surprised.</p><br/><p>What was going on with Cong Nianwei, the most popular and talented girl in the department and the beauty of QH University in both Science and Technology? She was showing off her relationship before her classmates!</p><br/><p>Everyone was talking heatedly in low voices.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin, who was sitting in the front row, overheard someone talking about Cong Nianwei and turned around to have a look. Suddenly, he did a double take. Fuck! Are my eyes fooling me? Is that Qin Guan smiling like silly? He dares show up in our class? Unbelievable! He has gone too far in bullying me!</p><br/><p>He tore down a blank page from his notebook, wrote something on it, rolled it into a ball and threw it at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was lying on the desk smiling when a spit ball hit him on the head.</p><br/><p>He spread it open and read, \u201cWhat are you doing here? This is QH University.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled again. At the time, he had nothing to do, so he picked up a pen from Cong Nianwei's pencil case and wrote, \u201cMy girlfriend is here, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>He rolled the ball again and threw it back.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin looked quite angry at his words. He replied, \u201cThis is my turf.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wrote back, \u201cI\u2019m risking my life, daring to challenge the emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ball came and went fast. Cong Nianwei couldn't stand their childishness. She pulled her chair a little further away without Qin Guan noticing. He was too happy playing.</p><br/><p>It was hard to aim with a flying ball. Qin Guan turned around and played his trump card.</p><br/><p>He tore another blank page, blew his nose on it and threw it back at Chi Hailin.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin was suspecting why the ball had taken so long to fly back to him.</p><br/><p>When it landed on his desk, he opened it excitedly, and the paper stuck to his hand.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin cried out and stood up.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was laughing secretly in the back row, covering his mouth.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin stood up angrily with snot on his hand. He turned around and shouted loudly, \u201cQin Guan, I will fight you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The angry young man had forgotten that he was in a crowded classroom. The professor and all the students turned their eyes on him.</p><br/><p>A soft voice sounded from behind him, \u201cI don't care who you want to fight with. You shouted in the middle of my class, so somebody will indeed fight you. Step outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hands clasped behind his back, the designing class professor led Chi Hailin out of the classroom.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin was so depressed that he forgot to wipe the snot off his hand.</p><br/><p>Crossing his legs, Qin Guan enjoyed his success.</p><br/><p>The professor suddenly appeared in front of him, his hands still behind his back. \u201cYou\u2019re not attending my class, boy. Step outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stopped smiling and left his seat with a pout. As he walked to the front row, he blew Cong Nianwei a kiss and ran out of the classroom before anyone could react.</p><br/><p>The classroom erupted in whispers.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei pretended to be calm. I have no idea what\u2019s going on.</p><br/><p>The professor restored the order, but Cong Nianwei could still hear conversations going on around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he? I have never met him before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s from another college.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he was from our university, I\u2019d know him. He's so much more handsome from the guys in our class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did he blow that kiss at? It was in my direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>That particular student was thinking too much. Plus, it was a guy.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin followed Qin Guan as soon as he was kicked out of the classroom. Qin Guan burst into laughter when he saw him. \u201cSorry, I can't help it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin was quite angry. Why did he have to keep running into that idiot? Helplessly, he told Qin Guan, \u201cShall we be nicer to each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spread his hands. \u201cWhy do I have to be nice to someone who hasn\u2019t been nice to me? Besides, you were too worked up to handle the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin stretched out his snot-covered hand. \u201cAre you afraid of destroying your image?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grinned. \u201cWe both know I only care about Cong Nianwei. Boy, you must be strong-willed. You\u2019re so young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin nearly cried of embarrassment. He ran away with his books, shouting loudly, \u201cI\u2019ll reveal your true colors to Cong Nianwei. You just wait and see!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was much taller and stronger than him. Chi Hailin was afraid that he would beat him up for threatening him, so he put some distance between them, just to be on the safe side.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei, who had just finished her class, took in the scene before her.</p><br/><p>She poked Qin Guan with her books in front of all her classmates.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smirked delightfully, taking a cool pose as he asked, \u201cWhat's the matter? Is your class over? Shall we go window-shopping or maybe watch a movie?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really jealous of his two roommates and their girlfriends.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

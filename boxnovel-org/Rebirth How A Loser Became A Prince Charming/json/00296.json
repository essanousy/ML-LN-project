In fact, not that many people in Asia know me. If you put aside the media and brand businessmen, my popularity is inferior compared to movie or TV stars.\"</p><br/><p>\"You shouldn\u2019t only think of the present. How can you be sure that I won\u2019t make my own destiny in the US? What's the gap between those models and me anyway? If you have enough power, race doesn\u2019t matter.\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides, without the constraint of a contact, I can go to the US with no burdens after I finish Zhang Jizhong's TV series. Try not to miss me too much!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue\u2019s blood started burning at Qin Guan's words. Rubbing her hands together, she said, \"It\u2019s a pity that my English isn\u2019t good. Otherwise, I could go to the US with you. Take care when you are alone. Safety first, money second.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. Marry somebody when I leave. Find a considerate man. I think Ou Qiang would be a good choice.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\"</p><br/><p>\"You bastard! You dare make fun of me!\" It\u2019s nice to have so many kind people around me.</p><br/><p>After nightfall, Tokyo indulged in life and debauchery. It was worth strolling around the city. The famous Shinjuku was not far from their hotel. For tourists, it was a perfect place to cruise around, but for locals it was only a resort.</p><br/><p>The scene at Shinjuku was interesting. Unlike the big shopping malls in Ginza or the luxurious clubs in Roppongi, the outskirts were bustling with life. Shinjuku was a food street. Don\u2019t be fooled by the boards outside the izakayas and the small restaurants. The images of beautiful, sexy girls only catered to the atmosphere of Shinjuku.</p><br/><p>In the brilliant, light-filled street, it was wise to have an attractive board.</p><br/><p>Behind those neon boards, groups of men gathered together. There were traditional Japanese dishes to be had at the restaurants, which were appreciated by office workers in the area.</p><br/><p>In that high-pressure society, people could find comfort in saki and special, handmade pickled saury.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Sister Xue had rice and some other dishes in a traditional Japanese restaurant. Then they kept walking, perfectly satisfied.</p><br/><p>All people were curious. As they walked by the neighboring restaurants, they saw the red-light district, which attracted a lot of tourists. In Japan, prostitution was not allowed openly.</p><br/><p>However, it was legal to introduce your girlfriend to others. Many people were working hard at it.</p><br/><p>As newcomers, tourists were easily cheated by procurers because of their enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>If one saw a young man standing by the road with a pile of photos of beautiful girls, they should be wary of him. He would charge them highly and demand a deposit. Then, after waiting happily in a hotel, they would meet a supreme beauty of 1.5 metres and 90 kilos.</p><br/><p>That was the best-case scenario. At least, they would have had a real Japanese girl. Sometimes they waited a whole night while the man got away with their money.</p><br/><p>In fact, experienced procurers would kindly guide tourists to their real destination, where the advertising boards were simple and honest.</p><br/><p>The girls would serve them considerately. A newcomer could hardly take them out though. Not all girls there were after money. Besides, many clubs didn't accept foreigners.</p><br/><p>Japanese girls were hard to understand. Many call girls even supported a young man.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Sister Xue were like peasants in a royal palace. They looked around them with curiosity. It was impossible to see all these things in China. Their heads were moving around like dolls with springs.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Welcome to our club! We have nice service...\"</p><br/><p>\"Young man, here! We are promoting some activities today...\"</p><br/><p>The procurers greeted everyone. It was a no-man\u2019s land around Qin Guan and Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t they recognize me, Sister Xue?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. Maybe handsome guys don\u2019t come here? Maybe they have their own place?\"</p><br/><p>Confused, they kept walking. Just leave us alone. That\u2019s better.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Xiaoze, did you see that man just now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! I\u2019m not blind!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha! Zichuan and Zhengshu will lose business. He must the secret weapon from Roppongi!\"</p><br/><p>\"But Roppongi and Shinjuku are fighting fiercely these days. A single man won\u2019t do!\"</p><br/><p>The two wretched procurers were whispering behind them. Suddenly, there was an uproar.</p><br/><p>\"They\u2019re coming!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that Renr from the most high-ranking club in Roppongi? What is he doing here?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. Maybe there\u2019s some common exchange or competition among the clubs. We are not in the same industry. Don\u2019t worry!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Better drive those Negroes out if they have time.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! When did they start intervening with foreign girls?\"</p><br/><p>A sub chief put down his microphone and said, \"The Big Brother of this area has just changed. The masters of the shops have all changed too. We have to visit the Big Brother later. A tough leader will control the Negroes better. Stop talking rubbish. How many clients did you have today?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

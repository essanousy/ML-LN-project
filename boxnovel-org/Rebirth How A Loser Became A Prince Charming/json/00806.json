The younger customers took a few more steps inside. The delightful clothing was a feast for the eyes.</p><br/><p>It was natural for people to pursue beauty. Everyone always had an occasion to wear formal clothes to, so Qin Guan's brand would become their first choice.</p><br/><p>Plus, young people were a big influence. Perhaps when they succeeded in their careers, LESS/MORE would become their obsession. The owner of the brand was really cunning. He had pulled off the perfect transition from a white-collar worker look to a rich businessman look.</p><br/><p>There was also a secret door at the customization area, whose purpose only fashion insiders were aware of. It had to be a secret elevator to the underground parking garage, which was reserved for VIPs that wanted to avoid the public eye.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was an extraordinary man.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone relaxed. Qin Guan's concept couldn't be imitated by others. No one could integrate the whole fashion circle into a single brand.</p><br/><p>Each store hired only one major designer. No company had the financial resources to employ so many designers, but it was a piece of cake for Qin Guan. The orders could be sent directly to his studio, or one of his team's designers could arrange a short meeting.</p><br/><p>Only Qin Guan could achieve something like this.</p><br/><p>Everyone exchanged meaningful glances and let out long sighs of relief. Suddenly, something happened.</p><br/><p>Ye Dong had brought together his old schoolmates to attend the ceremony. The young men, most of whom were working at large enterprises and public institutions, had been attracted by the clothing samples.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a young lady was trying on a tailored suit and complaining to her friends, \"I work in a bank, so I have to wear suits every day. I cannot wear other clothes, like girls who work at private enterprises. Senior Qin is so good at designing. If our uniform was like this, I would love wearing it!\"</p><br/><p>Both students and people of all ages disliked boring uniforms.</p><br/><p>A second girl raised her eyebrows and answered, \"That's easy. Just give the directors some feedback.\"</p><br/><p>\"Logistical personnel must fight back! I believe in Qin Guan. He is the best. Those inferior clothing factories only get orders because of their connections and the bribes they give.\"</p><br/><p>She had a valid point. Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>The spies were beating their chests in frustration. It was really hard to get a large order for uniforms. Qin Guan had scored a lucky goal.</p><br/><p>The lively ceremony ended with Qin Guan's departure. The store was on the right track, but its owner had helped it along. Qin Guan hadn't counted on his personality, unlike other brands created by stars. He had only concentrated on the designs.</p><br/><p>His smart concept and the large audience had led to the store's success.</p><br/><p>Finally free, Qin Guan stretched his body on his bed at home. He could at last catch a breath.</p><br/><p>He lit some colorful aromatic candles and felt the relaxing smell of the essential oil linger around the bed.</p><br/><p>He and Cong Nianwei were planning on moving away from their small home with the sweet memories, but an open living environment wouldn't go well with Qin Guan's fame. He had to sneak back home every day. Their house couldn't withstand the attacks of the paparazzi.</p><br/><p>He would only be spending a few more nights in that room.</p><br/><p>The shoes that fit one's feet didn't have to be expensive. Qin Guan preferred to have the right fit. His social status had changed a lot, but he couldn't do anything he wanted without getting into trouble.</p><br/><p>Doing the right thing at the right time showed one's experience and maturity. As he thought about this, Qin Guan turned to take the sleeping Cong Nianwei in his arms and blew out the candles one by one.</p><br/><p>Goodnight.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would be taking a trip to Taiwan. The Golden Horse Film Festival Awards, which had been founded in 1930, had a great influence in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.</p><br/><p>They had experienced both the golden time and the decline of the film industry in Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

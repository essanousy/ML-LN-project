The hostess discovered their love and fired Qin Guan to avoid an ill-matched marriage.</p><br/><p>After being sneered at by Xu's parents, Qin Guan left the villa, only to find the man with the glasses waiting for him. The two disappointed young men fought with each other in the rain.</p><br/><p>To pay them back for not getting invited to dinner, the prop team turned on the tap, turning the gentle rain into an intense downpour.</p><br/><p>Director Yin really loved the idea, so at his order, the heavy rain kept falling down on the narrow alley.</p><br/><p>The man with the glasses blocked Qin Guan's way.</p><br/><p>\"Did your parents-in-law invite you to dinner?\"</p><br/><p>\"Have you heard of The Last Supper?\"</p><br/><p>Raindrops landed on Qin Guan's umbrella as if they were beating against his hurting heart. The guy behind him couldn't see his face, but he asked him, \"What did you have for supper?\"</p><br/><p>Then he rushed up to Qin Guan, shouting like crazy, \"If you sent her that letter, it should be me having supper with her!\"</p><br/><p>The two men threw their umbrellas away and started fighting in the rain.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed the guy away with only one arm, but the crazy man conquered his fear and rushed back at him again.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the overwhelming rain, Qin Guan looked like a drowned rat by then. He couldn't see anything through the raindrops, just like he couldn't find a way out in that hopeless love affair.</p><br/><p>The man with the glasses looked much worse than him. The two of them rolled around in the mud, trying their best to beat one another. Only when they rolled in the channel running alongside the alley did the director send Xu over to stop the fight.</p><br/><p>\"Cut! Good! Let's have a 10-minute break!\"</p><br/><p>Before his voice could fade away, Wang walked over with a large towel and wiped off Qin Guan's hair and face. Director Yin's next words scared her.</p><br/><p>\"That was pretty good, but fighting from this side to the other might be better. We can try it later.\"</p><br/><p>Are you kidding? My boss just ate a bowl of noodles!</p><br/><p>Both the actor and the director were serious about their work. Qin Guan walked into the rain again without complaining. To be safe, they repeated the scene a full three times that night. Both actors were exhausted and wet by the time it was over.</p><br/><p>The two men rushed to their rooms quickly, eager to have a warm bath and get some sleep.</p><br/><p>The man with the glasses had no scenes the next day, but Qin Guan was about to experience an even tougher trial as the couple's love reached its peak.</p><br/><p>The crew moved to a traditional rustic wooden house and a rice mill. Qin Guan was wearing gray linen clothes and black loose pants with rolled-up pant legs. The thick cloth shoes on his bare feet made him look like a country boy.</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing couldn't recognize the international award-winning actor anymore. He looked like a plain, honest countryman, which created a sharp contrast against Xu Ruoxuan, who looked like an angel dressed in white.</p><br/><p>As they looked at each other, her fair hands and his brown palms locked together before the camera. They embraced each other next to the stream before Xu stayed over at his place.</p><br/><p>She hadn't brought any clothes with her, so she borrowed some from the drawer Qin Guan's mother used. Her young face looked fascinating in the dim lamplight.</p><br/><p>Before shooting the scene, Yin Li, who was a kind gentleman, had asked Xu if she wanted to use special effects to avoid sharing a real kiss with Qin Guan. The girl had clenched her fists. \"I will make a sacrifice for my career.\"</p><br/><p>Li didn't eat anything for three days.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

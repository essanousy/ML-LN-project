Despite its outstanding box office, the film was not as popular among critics, who'd had great expectations about the film and were sharing their negative opinions about it.</p><br/><p> However, this did not influence the film's box office in China. All the fans considered the reviews praise for Qin Guan's work.</p><br/><p> \"I'm looking forward to Qin Guan's performance in the film. Everything else about it has been criticized except Qin Guan. He must have given a good performance.\"</p><br/><p> \"Why hasn't the film premiered internationally? I'm really eager to see it.\"</p><br/><p> \"Don't worry. This will be a wonderful winter holiday. We have two films of Qin Guan's to look forward to. One drama and one comedy.\"</p><br/><p> The critics were nothing compared to Qin Guan's fans. Soon, he heard news of victory from the other side of the ocean. After dominating the first place on North America's box office ranking list, \"Night At The Museum\" had pocketed 160 million dollars during its opening week.</p><br/><p> All the comments about the film were positive. Everyone loved it.</p><br/><p> As a result, Qin Guan became the first actor to be nominated for a Saturn Award for two films. Both the critics and the audience were looking forward to his success.</p><br/><p> They were confident that Qin Guan would attract the attention of the Oscar committee with his two outstanding films. It would not be a bad outcome if one of them was selected for the next round.</p><br/><p> Unfortunately, when the Oscar nominees were revealed in February, people were surprised to see that neither film had been shortlisted. Qin Guan's fans and some professional critics voiced their discontent.</p><br/><p> \"I'm confused about the Oscar committee's standards this year.\"</p><br/><p> \"I wonder if Qin Guan is too focused on winning an Oscar. I know that all stars dream of winning one. At first, I thought it was possible for him, but this news made me rethink the matter. Could it take Qin Guan 30 years to win an Oscar? \"</p><br/><p> \"Yes. Back when Qin Guan participated in indie films, the Oscar committee said that they preferred popular films and that the Oscars are commercial awards. Despite the fact that he won a Golden Globe, Qin Guan missed this opportunity. Today, the Oscar committee has rejected him again, although his films did well both in terms of popularity and box office.\"</p><br/><p> \"Exactly! Now, he has also starred in successful commercial films, which is unprecedented. However, it seems that is still not enough for him to win an Oscar.\"</p><br/><p> \"I want to cry for him. Maybe China will buy the Oscars one day and Qin Guan will get on the stage to receive his award.\"</p><br/><p> That particular fan had a wild imagination. At the time, America had been going through an unparalleled crisis. A subprime crisis had taken over the world like a storm. The US was selling bonds to China, so some famous brands, who couldn't support themselves anymore, had been purchased by Chinese redneck entrepreneurs.</p><br/><p> However, the Oscars were a symbol of the film industry, so they couldn't be sold or purchased. They belonged to Hollywood. Without their origin, the Oscars would no longer be the same.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Along the 100-meter potholed path was only a dim lamp post.</p><br/><p>\"Follow me. Let's make some inquiries around my own house. Maybe we misjudged the situation. I should have come by in the daytime and had a meeting with Grandpa Yang first.\"</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could finish his words, several glaring beams came from the direction of his yard.</p><br/><p>\"Who is there?\"</p><br/><p>The dark night was lit up by flashlights. Qin Guan and his friends lifted their hands up to protect their eyes from the light. Bu had never been provoked like this before. The bad-tempered man cast the first stone.</p><br/><p>\"Son of a b*tch! What are you doing? You shouldn't point a flashlight in someone else's eyes!\"</p><br/><p> Those bright lights were a miserable memory for most of the people on the site. The sudden light reminded them of the old days.</p><br/><p>Bu's vigorous shout elicited no response. None of the flashlights were turned off after his threat. Instead, a strange, familiar sound came his way. It sounded as if the air had been ripped.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\"Son of a b*tch! What the hell was that? It was not a brick...\"</p><br/><p>The lucky man moved the stinky, sticky thing away from his forehead and roared angrily, \"You bastards! Why did you throw rotten eggs at me?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan reacted quickly at his words, squatting down and covering his head with his hands before he cried out amid the empty yard, \"This is my house! I'm Qin Guan! I just returned from America!\"</p><br/><p>The enemy held back its biochemical weapons.</p><br/><p>\"You are Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p> \"Who took you to Grandpa Yang's that day?\"</p><br/><p>\"Auntie Liu. I've been gone for nearly a year. How is she?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's him! It's the owner of the house! It's Qin Guan! This is a misunderstanding!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the flashlights went out and a dim lamp was lit in the small yard. A few men wearing shirts, tanks and shorts appeared, carrying baskets on their backs.</p><br/><p>Bu and his men looked helpless. Each of them had a yolk on his head.</p><br/><p>\"Why did you sneak in at night?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, young Qin. You walked in here silently like experienced thieves!\"</p><br/><p>\"You were even wearing black. We couldn't see you clearly in the dark!\"</p><br/><p>Some considerate residents brought towels from their homes to clean up the eggs. They still smelled pretty awful though.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered his own house and tried to calm down. Then he introduced his team to Grandpa Yang. The residents were glad to meet the visitors. A group of mysterious men in black had been appearing and disappearing surreptitiously in the area lately, so they would welcome any external help.</p><br/><p>The men looked perfect for the job, if one ignored the yolks.</p><br/><p> Bu Qinglu patted his own chest professionally. \"No problem! Leave this to us. They are doomed. When will they be coming?\"</p><br/><p>\"Anytime now. You are just in time.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, there's no time to lose. Split up, guys. If we are lucky enough, we will settle this tonight.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone got into position immediately. Qin Guan was left in an empty room with a sole candle.</p><br/><p>Bu just wanted to help his friend, but the residents knew that Qin Guan was not familiar with the alley, so all Qin Guan could do was take out his cell phone sadly and send Cong Nianwei, who was on the other side of the ocean, a grumpy message. Suddenly, he heard chaos from afar.</p><br/><p>\"Catch him! Son of a b*tch! He is so cunning!\"</p><br/><p> Bang!</p><br/><p>\"Spare me, man!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't hurt me! I have money!\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\"</p><br/><p>Did they catch the thief? It sounds like he's been hurt badly!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Forget it, there\u2019s no time for that.</p><br/><p>Pretending to hold a needle between his fingers, Qin Guan struck his most flattering pose and poked at the frame. There had to be someone coming. Taking advantage of Professor Li's lessons, Qin Guan tilted his head to the side. That was the best pose for a lens.</p><br/><p>Li Shaohong found the boy's performance interesting. Forming a frame with her fingers, she looked through them to observe Qin Guan's lens sense.</p><br/><p>He turned around, sat back, and turned his back to the camera. The boy had a good figure. He stared at an imaginary princess to show his elegant style.</p><br/><p>Then Qin Guan stood up, opened his lips and said, \"Can you do stitch work, my princess?\" After several seconds, he gestured in the air. \"Your hands should be higher...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pretended to put his hand on someone\u2019s shoulder to teach them how to embroider.</p><br/><p>Li Shaohong knocked on the table. Wonderful! It\u2019s romantic, in spite of the vacant space. He looks at her as if she\u2019s the whole world! For a green hand, he is better than most actors!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wasn\u2019t about to tell her that he was pretending the princess and the queen were both Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>It was easy for him to play a male imperial concubine. If it made Cong Nianwei happy, he could pretend to be cooler. It wasn\u2019t too much to ask.</p><br/><p>The director was satisfied. Qin Guan changed into his clothes, and Sister Xue went to get the contract. Everyone was happy.</p><br/><p>Li knew that Qin Guan was a college student and she promised to look after him. On the way back to college, Qin Guan realized that he had passed the audition.</p><br/><p>He decided to tell his girlfriend first by showing her Li's autograph in his pocket. He had begged for that signature shamelessly.</p><br/><p>He still recalled the speechless expression on Sister Xue\u2019s face and the amused one on Li Shaohong\u2019s face. He kept murmuring to himself, \"I\u2019m sorry, Sister Xue. I may have lost you face again, but I did it for my girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p>Fine, Cong Nianwei was more important!</p><br/><p>She had to be at the house currently, watching the workers paint the wall. The previous day they had realized that neither of them was good at physical work. Therefore, they had hired a labor contractor. It had cost them only 200 yuan to have all the walls painted.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan returned home, the house was already clean. Cong Nianwei was busy picking up newspapers from the floor.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hugged her from behind and turned her around. Before Cong Nianwei could get angry, he took out Li's autograph and showed her.</p><br/><p>He had narrowly escaped disaster. Cong Nianwei blushed from joy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried to steal a kiss. Huh? She\u2019s not angry! She has to get used to my kisses at some point!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei paid no attention to Qin Guan though. She was too busy reading the script of the play.</p><br/><p>What a wonderful play! I hope to see it on TV as soon as possible. Considering the state of modern literature, Cong Nianwei liked to read stories of that style.</p><br/><p>She patted Qin Guan on the shoulder encouragingly and grumbled in a flirtish manner, \"I have been working the whole day. Take me out to dinner! After supper, we can back and read the script! It\u2019s your scene soon! Come on, move! Move!\"</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could regret everything, Professor Li, who had heard the news, arrived and took him away.</p><br/><p>Professor Li raised both hands in approval at Qin Guan. That was what things were like in the capital. If you were popular, sponsors spent a lot of money on you. Nobody cared about how you became popular though.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was escorted to a big yard in Golden Fish Hutong. It was a standard courtyard with an antique arch.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the yard there was a clove tree that made the whole structure look lively.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stared at an old lady, who had been invited to instruct him on traditional formalities. Is she really a history professor at the Capital University?</p><br/><p>The old lady looked back at Qin Guan with a disgusted expression. He\u2019s like a pillow in an embroidered case, but one filled with hay. Why would my granddaughter like such a guy? It\u2019s because of my friend Li Ying, who brought a poster of him when we met while my granddaughter was at my house. I had originally planned on saying no, but my granddaughter forced me to accept the student. The girl is eight, but she sure can tell if someone is beautiful. I shouldn't tell her stories about historical, famously handsome men!</p><br/><p>As she thought of this, she used the pointer in her hand to hit Qin Guan's legs, which were in the wrong position. She reproached him, \"Are you an idiot? I just showed you how to do it!\"</p><br/><p>Lady Rong felt guilty as she uttered the words. The boy was really clever. He had been gifted with an extraordinary retentive memory.</p><br/><p>If he remains like that, I might accept him as a formal student. (Old lady, where is your dignity?)</p><br/><p>After half a day of traditional formalities lessons, Lady Rong showed her benevolent side to Qin Guan. She let him drink some water and led him into the courtyard.</p><br/><p>An ancient, simple embroidery frame was inside. Sitting up by the frame, the old lady pulled a thread through a needle and began to stitch. The slender silk thread was flying elegantly between her fingers.</p><br/><p>She fixed the end of the needle and stood up. \"I don't know what play you\u2019ll be acting in. Actually, men and women were the same when it came to embroidery. In ancient times, there were also male embroidery experts. As an actor, you can only imitate the movements.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

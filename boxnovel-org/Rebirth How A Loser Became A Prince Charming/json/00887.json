Plus, Qin Guan was usually too busy.</p><br/><p>The film \"Curse Of The Golden Flower\" premiered during a specific period of the year though. It was the most fun time for most actors, so the crew expected that Qin Guan would promote the film even more through the premiere.</p><br/><p>The event would be held at the Wanda Mall, which was located on the East 2nd Ring. It was the most luxurious shopping mall in Asia. The open shopping center and cinema combined cuisine, entertainment and shopping. That premiere would be the first to be held there.</p><br/><p>Reporters, distinguished guests and fans crowded into the hall that day.</p><br/><p>The lucky fans who had gotten invitations for the premiere entered the hall, looking excited and worried. A glimpse outside the hall confirmed Qin Guan's presence.</p><br/><p>They were so excited! They would get the rare chance to meet Qin Guan in person!</p><br/><p>Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat were absent from the ceremony, but no one cared about that. They just wanted to meet Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan got on the stage, the audience got excited.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Look over here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! I love you!\"</p><br/><p>The chaos that ensued covered the host's voice. Camera and cell phone clicks could be heard everywhere. In an effort to keep the premiere running smoothly, Qin Guan gestured at everyone. \"Hush...\" He hoped his fans would go silent and at least let the host finish his introduction.</p><br/><p>The fans gasped in admiration at his manners. Some girls almost fainted, their hands going to their chests. Everyone lowered their voices and let the host speak.</p><br/><p>The host, who was from the Beijing Entertainment Channel, finished his job professionally. Any host would feel awkward around Qin Guan. No man was more handsome and famous than the award-winning actor after all. Qin Guan's smile could beat even the most well-crafted speech.</p><br/><p>Soon, the eager fans and reporters began to ask questions.</p><br/><p>\"Director Zhang, what are your expectations regarding the box office?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's said that you invested 100 million in the film.\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you think of the failure of 'The Promise'?\"</p><br/><p>\"Is this the era of Chinese blockbusters?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your film has been nominated for an Oscar. Is this because of Qin Guan's influence?\"</p><br/><p>\"Could you please introduce the characters and their relationships in advance?\"</p><br/><p>Director Zhang was left speechless by the sparkling eyes under the stage. Both the media and the audience seemed to be very interested in the film.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, but this is the premiere. I'll only answer questions about the film.\"</p><br/><p>He looked at his watch deliberately and whispered to the host, \"The reporters have 10 minutes.\"</p><br/><p>The reporters and the audience looked anxious. We haven't gotten any answers yet!</p><br/><p>They all concentrated their fire on Qin Guan and Jay Chou.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, this is your first cooperation with Chou, who is actually a singer. What did you think of his acting skills?\"</p><br/><p>You are going to get me in trouble, bro.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan began to praise Chou against his will. \"He is a very hard-working actor. He can study a single scene until midnight. He is the most dedicated young actor I have ever met. We are also good friends in real life.\"</p><br/><p>Chou felt so moved that he leaned his shoulder against Qin Guan's.</p><br/><p>Thank you so much, dude.</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan hadn't even mentioned anything about his acting skills.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, what's your opinion about your character in the film? He is a coward. He does not seem like a real prince. Is he quite different from your previous roles?\"</p><br/><p>You have no idea what a different role is really like.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan usually made the decision to disappear as soon as one of his films was in theaters.</p><br/><p>Such questions were nothing for him though.</p><br/><p>\"In my opinion, an actor should keeping make progress forever. Even if they are suitable for only one type of film, they should still act with all their effort. A famous actor can succeed through only playing one kind of character, but there are so many films and roles in the world. If I could choose, I would try a new one each time.\"</p><br/><p>\"For example, the eldest prince is not a very decisive man, He is actually a complicated coward, so a character like him is a challenge for my acting skills.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

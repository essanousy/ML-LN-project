Some also volunteered at the neighboring elderly homes, welfare homes, churches and childcare centers for free.</p><br/><p>The City Hall wanted to encourage that behavior because, as a Chinese saying goes, the world is full of love. This was the dream of the New York mayor.</p><br/><p>The police supervised the people sentenced to community service. For those people, doing community work was a real punishment.</p><br/><p>It was a sunny day in autumn, and Qin Guan was in Qu's car. He was wearing a black hoodie and some LEE jeans, and there was a small tool set by his feet. His team included a cameraman and some social workers.</p><br/><p>Their first stop was a school library. In America, senior students had to help their juniors with their homework for free.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered the library. There was no applause. The kids were all too busy struggling with their exercises.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat down next to them. A pair of students scratched their ears and cheeks in embarrassment. Not all good students could be good teachers.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was dressed like a pipefitter. \"Do you need help?\" he asked them with a friendly smile.</p><br/><p>The two kids hurt him with their honest words.</p><br/><p>\"Mom was right. Handsome athletes only become pipefitters after graduating from school.\"</p><br/><p>The younger one was much more impolite.</p><br/><p>\"Just like the idiot dating my sister. He is a nut.\"</p><br/><p>Kids were terrible...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried to suppress his anger by putting on a smile. \"Actually, helping you with your homework is part of my community service.\"</p><br/><p>They both shot a pitying look at him. \"So you have nothing else to do?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless, but he still had to carry out his duty.</p><br/><p>\"Show me your book. What do you not understand?\"</p><br/><p>\"This, this\u2026 Oh, and this one!\"</p><br/><p>So, you don't understand anything at all!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried to explain. His clean, enlightening voice attracted all the children in the library.</p><br/><p>\"That man's voice sounds so good!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tutored the kids before the camera. He seemed gentle under the warm light. All kids were angels. When one understood them, they realized they were all beautiful.</p><br/><p>Their work on their first stop was successful. Thanks to Huang Jiajia's experience, Qin Guan was accepted by all the children. Just when he was about to leave, a small hand grabbed his jeans and two children put some candy in his hands. Some of it was homemade, while some had been bought with their pocket money.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan craned his neck towards them. \"Give me a farewell kiss.\"</p><br/><p>He got some snot instead.</p><br/><p>\"Since we are friends now, I can admit that you are a handsome guy.\"</p><br/><p>Before leaving, they gave Qin Guan some advice.</p><br/><p>\"Keep some distance from women!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan escaped as fast as his feet would move.</p><br/><p>The cars departed, heading to their next destination. The children just shrugged and turned away.</p><br/><p>The parks downtown provided New Yorkers with a green resting area. Collecting trash was part of their important community service.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

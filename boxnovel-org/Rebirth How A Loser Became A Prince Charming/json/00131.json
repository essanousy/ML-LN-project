The photographer shouted in English, \"Perfect!\"</p><br/><p>If Sister Xue had known that Qin Guan would have to dress up like a labor worker, she might have been more hesitant to accept the job.</p><br/><p>The taste of American people was quite different from the taste of people from other countries. They promoted roughness, and were incompatible with Paris, Milan and London fashion.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was interested in that coarse style, as he found it familiar. Before his American partner arrived, Qin Guan picked up a paint bucket and a brush and began to paint on an iron ladder.</p><br/><p>Shouting \"Perfect!\", the photographer got down to work. When John followed his assistant in, he saw an Asian fairy dancing in front of him. As a bisexual, he felt an attraction to Qin Guan, as if he was a delicious piece of cake.</p><br/><p>He took off all his clothes as fast as he could, put on the jumpsuit pants, and walked into the site with his upper body bare. John\u2019s assistant knew exactly what he was doing. It was an old problem of his.</p><br/><p>The photographer was confused. John had to wear a red latticed shirt that would create a contrast with Qin Guan's blue-white one.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of Qin Guan\u2019s confusion, John hugged him tightly and told him warmly, \"Hello, how are you?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was holding the brush in one hand and the paint bucket in the other, couldn't help but laugh.</p><br/><p>Silence fell as yellow paint landed on John\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Trying to be polite, Qin Guan transferred the brush to his other hand, intending to shake hands with John. John tried to hug him again though.</p><br/><p>Another streak of paint was smeared across his chest. The tough, hairy man looked like he was wearing a bright yellow bra.</p><br/><p>The photographer shouted at the two naughty guys, \"What are you doing? We\u2019re working here!\"</p><br/><p>The two bastards were wasting time. It would take a long time to wash that paint off.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried to make up for his mistake. He picked up the rest of the buckets and brushed paint on both his and John\u2019s body. Now they looked like two upfitters who had just finished work.</p><br/><p>The photographer\u2019s anger turned into pleasure as he began to work.</p><br/><p>John had no time to play around with Qin Guan. As it had turned out, the fairy was not just good-looking, but also witty. They worked together in complete focus, finishing the photos in a short time.</p><br/><p>What would they do about the paint on their bodies in the next picture though, where their upper bodies were supposed to be bare?</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was a real professional. She murmured something to John\u2019s assistant and got a bottle of floral water.</p><br/><p>She poured the floral water on the paint on Qin Guan's body. After several minutes, it was washed off easily with soap.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan kindly handed the rest of the bottle to John. The paint on John\u2019s body was his fault after all.</p><br/><p>John misunderstood his gesture. He thought the handsome Asian man was about to hug him.</p><br/><p>He tried to hug Qin Guan for the third time that day, but it was in vain. Qin Guan was dizzy from the fragrance of the water, and he went to wash.</p><br/><p>When they came out again in Z series jeans, everyone in the studio was shocked.</p><br/><p>Thick masculine hormones flew in the air. These were no slender young men, or fragile flowery boys. They were tough, strong men.</p><br/><p>They bent over the dais on the roof, turning their backs to the photographer and the others. The coarse pants looked perfect on their bodies.</p><br/><p>The contrast of their skin was made even sharper by their different race. Qin Guan\u2019s fine, smooth skin was in perfect harmony with John's hairy skin.</p><br/><p>The photographer thought that was enough. He asked them to stand on the dais and took photos of them from below. (Tip: Don\u2019t try this at home, unless you have long legs and a handsome face.)</p><br/><p>This was the upside of having long legs. The strong man with the six-pack and the shiny young man both looked really attractive.</p><br/><p>When the photoshoot was over, Qin Guan wanted to jump down from the dais. Realizing that this would be his only chance, John patted him on the butt.</p><br/><p>Wow! It was nice and elastic, like an Asian dessert. John was all for pursuing a romance in that mysterious country.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at him in confusion, but Sister Xue didn't take it seriously. It was a common joke among men.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s problem was that he would be returning to college with a buzz-cut. His fellow students might think he had been arrested by the police.</p><br/><p>As it turned out, he was surrounded as soon as he reached the entrance of his college.</p><br/><p>His college was quite different from art schools, such as the Capital Film and Television College, the Capital Drama College, and so on. No entertainment star had ever emerged from it. Although Qin Guan was just on the edge of the modelling circle, it was still enough for him to cause a sensation.</p><br/><p>Every student, no matter how busy, called their friends to discuss the tragedy of the college Prince Charming.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the glasses he had bought to disguise himself had been of no use. Pretending not to care, Qin Guan walked calmly to his dormitory.</p><br/><p>Some brave girls among the onlookers took action when they saw that Qin Guan was not angry with them.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I\u2019m XXX from the Finance Department. Could you please sign your name for me?\"</p><br/><p>\"I want an autograph, too! Could you please write \u2018for XXX from the XXX Department\u2019?\" another girl asked, giving him specific instructions.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

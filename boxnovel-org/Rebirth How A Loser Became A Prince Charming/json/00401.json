Qin Guan pressed her head fiercely towards his as they exchanged hot kisses.</p><br/><p> Julia\u2019s mind had gone blank. She had forgotten to breathe and act. This man had occupied her brain completely.</p><br/><p> She kissed Qin Guan back fiercely, her symbolic wide mouth feasting on him. She nearly bit Qin Guan's nose off as she kissed him and licked him.</p><br/><p> \"Wait...\" Qin Guan was out of breath. \"I want to use the washroom.\"</p><br/><p> Julia hugged his head and whispered to him, \"Beware of the mini camera.\"</p><br/><p> Then she left, leaving him behind with a surprised expression.</p><br/><p> \"Good! Cut!\"</p><br/><p> It was a perfect day for the beautiful woman and the handsome boy, who had a love and hate relationship.</p><br/><p> The whole crew left. Qin Guan was the last one there. He had to remove his makeup and change clothes all by himself. Famous actors had their own assistants and cars, but he had to rely on himself.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan liked that feeling though. He put on some loose pants and sneakers and headed to the bus stop.</p><br/><p> In November, his breath turned into mist outside. Lonely lamps were standing along the road. A large Buick business car was parked by the sidewalk.</p><br/><p> Julia had pasted her face to the back window. Her cheekbones were flat against the glass.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan nearly passed by her, when she suddenly realized the glass was between them. \"Driver, lights! Lights!\" Julia rolled down the window, shouting at the driver.</p><br/><p> The lights made Qin Guan go dizzy.</p><br/><p> He narrowed his eyes to see clearly who was annoying him.</p><br/><p> A woman with a wide mouth was shouting and waving at him. \"Qin Guan, over here!\"</p><br/><p> \"Ouch!\" The silly girl had overestimated herself and gotten stuck by the window.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan burst into laughter at Julia, whose eyeballs had nearly fallen out of their sockets.</p><br/><p> \"Stop laughing at me! I just wanted to say hi. Cough, cough...\"</p><br/><p> Julia drew her head back. Qin Guan was standing outside the window, looking into her eyes with a smile.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, she blushed. She was an experienced woman. She was no longer a pure girl. In front of that young man though, who was younger than her by more than 10 years, she couldn't help but smile and flush.</p><br/><p> Looks were the best traffic permit. She wanted to help him even more.</p><br/><p> \"Not driving today? Need a ride home?\" Julia was not a proud movie diva. She was actually very approachable in real life.</p><br/><p> \"Yes. My girlfriend has taken the car... Could you please take me to the nearest subway station, if it\u2019s not too much trouble?\"</p><br/><p> \"No problem.\"</p><br/><p> The car drove away, leaving the empty shooting location behind.</p><br/><p> In five minutes, it pulled to a stop at a corner of the bustling New York City. A tall young man went into the subway station fast.</p><br/><p> The window rolled up. As she stared at Qin Guan\u2019s back, Julia let out a long breath. Danny's number was twinkling on the screen of her phone.</p><br/><p> \"Hi, honey. I\u2019m coming home. Okay. Love you...\"</p><br/><p> Temptation was everywhere in life. There would always be someone better, but one rarely had a chance to change their mind.</p><br/><p> Julia's mind was filled with her sweet boyfriend. She had forgotten about the ripples caused by Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> One had to choose the most suitable mate, not the best one. Mature people gave up on such unrealistic thoughts.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan\u2019s only thought was that he would never let Cong Nianwei watch the film.</p><br/><p> The next day, Julia greeted Qin Guan first when he rushed into the makeup room. Qin Guan sensed a change in her though. There was no longer embarrassment in her expression, just the concern a senior actor felt about a green hand.</p><br/><p> That's better. He let out a breath of relief.</p><br/><p> As a professional actress and a movie queen, Julia taught him a lot during the shooting. Qin Guan tried his best to learn from her experience.</p><br/><p> This was a precious chance that he could benefit a lot from.</p><br/><p> They had shot most of the movie already. The tears of his girlfriend made Chuck want to return to his normal life. He had his own thriving career, and his shows were always attracting public attention.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After having dined and wined to satiety, they considered Qin Guan a member of their group. After lunch, Qin Guan took Cong Nianwei to her dormitory and bid her farewell, unwilling to part with her. Taking advantage of her waving her hand, he ran up to her and kissed her on the face. Then he sped up and ran away. As he was running, he shouted at the girls, \"Now we are at the kissing stage! Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>The girls laughed and shouted, making fun of Cong Nianwei. Cong Nianwei's cheeks started burning at once. Touching the spot where Qin Guan had kissed her unconsciously, she grumbled flirtingly, \"So much saliva!\" Then she ran back to her dormitory.</p><br/><p>After kissing her, Qin Guan felt like he was walking on a cloud for the whole afternoon. It was dark by the time he left the library and went back to his dormitory. Before he went to bed, he received a call from Cong Nianwei. She rarely calls me at night. What's happened?</p><br/><p>He heard Cong Nianwei sobbing on the other end of the line. \"What should I do, Qin Guan? Chi Hailin has committed suicide!\"</p><br/><p>What? Chi has dared commit suicide? Qin Guan\u2019s first thought was to misdoubt her words, but he comforted Cong Nianwei calmly, \"Calm down. Tell me more, and I\u2019ll be there soon.\" Then he got dressed to go out. After walking a short distance outside the door, he went back. If the matter proves to be significant, I won\u2019t be dressed well enough to face a crowd. I have to ask someone to go with me.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his dormitory and asked Wang Lei and Liu Xiaoyang to go with him without any further explanation. He hadn't know much about the matter himself after all.</p><br/><p>In the taxi, Cong Nianwei gave Qin Guan more context. Apparently, Chi Hailin had wanted to put an end to his first love. He hadn't gone to class that afternoon. He had bought a bouquet to confess his love to Cong Nianwei instead. When Cong Nianwei had returned to her dormitory at dusk, she had found Chi with the bouquet under a tree. Her friends had realized what the guy was about to do immediately, so they\u2019d left Cong Nianwei alone. Before Cong Nianwei could reject him, Chi Hailin had gotten down on one knee and told her excitedly, \"I love you, Cong Nianwei. Will you be my girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p>His resounding confession had attracted the attention of the students passing by. They had all turned to the secret corner and watched the drama unfold. Onlookers had gathered rapidly. Even the sills of the dormitory building had been full of heads. That boy is so brave to dare confess his love outside the girls\u2019 dormitory! (In 1999, such a thing was unexpected. It wasn\u2019t like nowadays, when confessions take place everywhere.)</p><br/><p>Finishing his confession. Chi had tried to hand Cong Nianwei the bouquet.</p><br/><p>Embarrassed, Cong Nianwei had told Chi, \"I already have a boyfriend. I appreciate the sentiment though. I\u2019m sorry.\"</p><br/><p>Then she\u2019d planned on leaving for her dormitory. The word sorry had crushed Chi's heart like a giant rock. Looking up, he had seen that Cong Nianwei was about to leave. He had stood up unconsciously and taken hold of her wrist. Slightly excited, Chi had refused to accept her answer. He had shouted at Cong Nianwei loudly, \"In which aspect am I inferior to that guy? Is there anything he\u2019s better at than me?\" Cong had felt her wrist hurt in his hand.</p><br/><p>She had been thinking calmly of a way to get away. What shall I say to him? That we don\u2019t know each other that well? That Qin Guan is better than him in all aspects except studying? Such a truth was inappropriate to say out loud. She had to state the facts. \"You are a good man, but love is not reasonable. I love him, not you.\"</p><br/><p>Queen Cong Nianwei\u2019s words had hurt him. Her roommates had seen Chi pulling at her. For fear that Cong Nianwei would be in danger, they had run downstairs to help. When they had gotten there, Chi had still been shouting loudly at her, \"You didn't even try to get along with me! How do you know that you wouldn't fall in love with me?\"</p><br/><p>Love was a mystery that could be generated in time, but in most cases, it happened at first sight, in one second, one moment. The image of one\u2019s lover was imprinted on their heart, eyes, and brain, never fading away. In one\u2019s youth, if they made a choice by listening to their heart, that choice was made with love.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had thought Chi was unreasonable and had planned on not engaging with him anymore. With the help of her roommates, she had escaped his hands. Massaging her hurting wrist, she had told him ruthlessly, \"I think I have made myself clear. Don\u2019t\u2019 mess with me anymore. I\u2019m telling you once more that I already have a boyfriend and I love him very much.\"</p><br/><p>How powerful her majesty was! That final rejection was the best way to avoid more serious harm in the future. Returning to her dormitory, Cong Nianwei had taken a deep, relaxing breath. Chi had been pursuing her for a long time. Other boys would have given up at her rejection, but he had kept fighting.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to reject him this openly and officially before. That day would be the end of this affair.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was resolute, but Chi Hailin had lost his mind. Muddle-headed, he had watched his goddess leave with her roommates, her final words haunting his mind. Qin Guan is her boyfriend. It was his first time to experience failure. In the first 19 years of his life, that lucky boy had been used to his parents and teachers\u2019 praise. He had always been a role model for other children.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

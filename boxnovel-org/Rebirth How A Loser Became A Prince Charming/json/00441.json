He shook his head and looked back at his mighty Hummer with the typical confidence of an elite.</p><br/><p>\"Good! Cut!\" The director stopped the cameras. Samantha\u2019s first scene was finished.</p><br/><p>There were only two relative shots left, which would be finished the next day. This was the high efficiency of American TV series.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan rushed up to Kim in the parking lot. The woman spoke to him with a smile, \"I like both vigorous Hummers and household Fords...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood there silently, holding the key of his small blue Ford. Qu was annoyed.</p><br/><p>\"What are you looking at? She is old enough to be your mom! Go! Go! You have a girlfriend at home! Stop flirting all the time!\"</p><br/><p>After half an hour, Qin Guan still felt wronged. When he got to his apartment, he tried to get Cong Nianwei to comfort him.</p><br/><p>\"Wei, Qu is really mean to me. She always shouts at me. Even the slightest disagreement makes her angry. I must have done something to her in a past life.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was working on a thick pile of papers as she answered his question. A pencil was balanced behind her ear.</p><br/><p>\"Is she a good agent?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is your schedule more reasonable after her rearrangements?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is she corrupted?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei turned her head around and smiled, her hair falling on her shoulders. \"That's enough. A strict, responsible agent is much better than a white-washing b*tch. Actually, I hope everyone around you is like Sister Qu.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan burst into laughter and hugged her around the waist from behind. \"Aha! You are jealous! Don't worry! My love is like the sun and the moon. It will never change.\"</p><br/><p>Her pencil left a post-modern style mark on the paper.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! My graph! This took me two hours to make!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wei, it's really late. Time for bed...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was both suffering and having fun. The next day, he arrived at the studio with a sweet smile. In several minutes though, his smile had faded away. He was naked except for a pair of flowery shorts. A kind-hearted assistant gave him a bathing towel.</p><br/><p>In that scene, Samantha would visit Qin Guan's apartment with a flower basket while Qin Guan was taking a shower.</p><br/><p>Dear director and scriptwriter, I would like to remind you that this is a predictable joke!</p><br/><p>The audience always liked that kind of story though.</p><br/><p>Great! This is my first TV series, and I have to sacrifice myself like in my first indie film.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was about to cover himself with the towel, the director sneered at him.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Don\u2019t do that. You are not a peasant! The towel should be on your chest. Act sexy, okay?\"</p><br/><p>Then he came over and pulled his shorts down.</p><br/><p>\"Let me go! What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>The shorts were now under Qin Guan's navel. They nearly fell down as people looked at him from behind.</p><br/><p>\"But, but...\"</p><br/><p>\"But what? Cover yourself!\"</p><br/><p>Dear Qu Xuemei, why were you so happy when you were giving me instructions?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sprinkled some water onto his body.</p><br/><p>\"Attention! We\u2019re doing the scene in the bathroom. Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan opened the door and saw Samantha standing outside with a flirting smile.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, I was taking a shower...\" Qin Guan looked shy. His lean muscles were visible on the camera pointed at his back.</p><br/><p>The assistant stared at Samantha in the lens. She\u2019s so lucky to have such a sexy encounter.</p><br/><p>\"I prepared a gift basket for our new neighbour. There\u2019s cheese, ham, condoms and handcuffs inside.\"</p><br/><p>While Samantha was saying something provocative, the director zoomed in on Qin Guan. His oiled skin looked sexy and full of light. Crystal-like, clear drops were running down along his cheeks, jaw, Adam\u2019s apple, and strong chest till they reached the towel.</p><br/><p>That common towel became an object of admiration.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s expression seemed to be acknowledging her invitation.</p><br/><p>\"Handcuffs?\" He raised his eyebrows in confusion.</p><br/><p>\"From the bar next door,\" Samantha replied at once.</p><br/><p>It was an SM bar with all kinds of equipment.</p><br/><p>She handed him the box and basket. \"I hope you\u2019ll enjoy them.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stopped smiling. With an evil, flirting expression, he warned the sexy woman, \"If I take them, my towel will fall down...\"</p><br/><p>\"I know...\" Samantha was frank.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled again, this time with the embarrassment of a boy and the confidence of an elite. He was good at combining different kinds of charm. He was like a sexy conqueror.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

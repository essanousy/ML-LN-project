It\u2019s him!</p><br/><p> Prof. Martin looked in the direction of the voice. The boy was quite different from the one in the photos. Students in Columbia University like to boost themselves up. It's not a good idea to dress like an ordinary person here. </p><br/><p> If Qin Guan could read Martin's mind, he would have protested loudly. He was there to study, not cause drama. All the students there seemed busy and calm. He didn't want to attract attention either.</p><br/><p> Prof. Martin got a grip on himself and began his opening lecture. \"If you are strolling on the shady path along the Hudson River, you will notice two American presidents accompanying you, as well as 97 Nobel winners.\"</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s a wonderful feeling, isn\u2019t it? As your tutor though, it\u2019s my job to bring you back to reality!\"</p><br/><p> \"Wake up, boys and girls! If that was true, you would definitely be seeing ghosts! I\u2019d admire anyone who would dare stand by the river calmly.\"</p><br/><p> \"Stop that rubbish right now! You are in the school of finance. Do you want to dream in your spare time? No problem. But there will only be two possible scenarios. One, you give up and fail the exams. The second scenario applies only to the geniuses among you. The homework I will give you will be a piece of cake for them.\"</p><br/><p> \"The first scenario can come true at any time, but the second one will only be a dream in my class. Today, I\u2019ll show you the advantages of studying finance at Columbia.\"</p><br/><p> As flowers bloomed and cicadas sang by the window, Prof. Martin began his lecture. As a straight-A student, Qin Guan was fascinated by the class.</p><br/><p> He only came back to his senses when the bell rang. He was about to rush out with his books, when he suddenly realized no one had left their seats.</p><br/><p> \"Okay, that\u2019s it for today. Your homework includes the core views of the three finance systems of Columbia...\"</p><br/><p> What? Homework? Are you kidding? </p><br/><p> Qin Guan, who had had no homework for many years, was shocked. He had written several theses, but he\u2019d had no homework in college.</p><br/><p> All the freshmen were taking notes earnestly.</p><br/><p> \"Send them to my email by tomorrow. Dismissed!\"</p><br/><p> Looking at the thick books in his hands, Qin Guan nearly spit out blood. This is so much work! I have to do it by tomorrow?</p><br/><p> This reminded Qin Guan of the lovely days during 12th grade, before he had taken the College Entrance Examination.</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao, the only other Asian student in class, kindly explained to Qin Guan, \"Freshmen always struggle in the beginning. There is a proverb that says that \u2018studying is a drug\u2019. You can\u2019t live without drugs. The homework today was fine. I have gone through more miserable phases in my life.\"</p><br/><p> Kuhn raised his eyebrows. Xu Xiaoxiao, the boy who is as dumb as an oyster, speaks on his own initiative? Without me, he would have cried eight times a day on campus.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled at the honest boy. \"Got it! Thanks! I\u2019m Qin Guan. I\u2019m from China.\"</p><br/><p> He stretched his fair, slender hand towards Xu, who looked stunned as he took it. \"Xu Xiaoxiao, I\u2019m Chinese American. I live in Manhattan.\"</p><br/><p> \"Are you ready, Xu Xiaoxiao? I\u2019m going to Roche Square. Are you coming with me?\" Kuhn was impatient to leave.</p><br/><p> \"Oh, I\u2019m coming!\" Xu Xiaoxiao looked at Qin Guan in disappointment and hastened to catch up with Kuhn.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan glanced at his watch. He had elective classes in the afternoon. Time was pressing. He had to have a quick lunch in the meantime.</p><br/><p>The classroom was empty. After classes had started, the relaxed atmosphere had disappeared from campus. There were hurried students everywhere. The university was of a practical style. Everything they did was career-oriented.</p><br/><p> Sitting in the corridor, Qin Guan was looking in the distance like a sculpture. Cong Nianwei walked up to him in a rush with her textbooks in her arms. His heart warmed up immediately.</p><br/><p> \"What did you think of the courses?\"</p><br/><p> \"There are differences from the theories we learned in China...\"</p><br/><p> They discussed their courses on the bus. They were so concentrated that they missed their stop.</p><br/><p> \"We are close to Chinatown. We can have lunch there and take a bus back.\"</p><br/><p> \"Good idea. We haven't been there. We can get off at Broadway Street.\"</p><br/><p> Walking hand in hand, they looked at the Chinese-style streets. It was like another city within Manhattan. It felt like they had gone back to a familiar place through a magic door.</p><br/><p> Pointing to the carved beams and the painted rafters with the red lanterns, Qin Guan suggested that they have lunch there.</p><br/><p> \"Okay!\" The two of them entered the Chinese restaurant.</p><br/><p> The bead curtains divided the two worlds. Qin Guan found a hidden, but beautiful spot inside. The owner must be rich, but he lacks knowledge on the Chinese culture.</p><br/><p> He had combined too many Chinese elements together. What a mess! In the eyes of American people though, this was what China was really like.</p><br/><p> In the center of the restaurant there was a stage for Peking opera, just like the stages in Brazilian and Russian restaurants.</p><br/><p> It was like a traditional house restaurant in China, or the little theater of Deyun Crosstalk Association. Everything was bright and gorgeous.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan ordered the boiled dumplings. They couldn't stand the so-called Chinese dishes they saw on other tables.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

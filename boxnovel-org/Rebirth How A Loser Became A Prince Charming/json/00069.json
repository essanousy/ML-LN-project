As she stood up to hand her cobblestone to Qin Guan, she asked proudly, \"What do you think? It's my latest work. My tutor assigned it as homework for mini interior design. Today I was inspired to clear my thoughts.\"</p><br/><p>When he saw her excited face, Qin Guan couldn't say anything. What could I possibly say? That she has totally missed the point of dating me? That would be like pouring a bucket of cold water over her. If I say that, I\u2019ll never date her successfully in the future.</p><br/><p>Against his will, Qin Guan gave Cong Nianwei a thumbs up and told her, \"I\u2019ll draw a picture for you. You can't laugh at the work of a person who's never learned to draw though.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei nodded with curiosity. She had never seen Qin Guan draw before. Qin Guan bent down to make the sand around him flat.</p><br/><p>\"Lie down!\" Zhou Jing and Li Jian buried their faces in the sand. They dared not look up until Qin Guan headed in another direction.</p><br/><p>\"We were nearly discovered! Phew! We ate a mouthful of sand! What the hell is Qin Guan doing?\" They both poked their heads and felt sand on their faces.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was drawing on the beach with the cobblestone, a cambered earthworm appeared on the sand. Cong Nianwei smirked unconsciously as she looked at the stupid boy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan drew a bow with a curving line. Then he added a second bow, forming a peach-shaped heart.</p><br/><p>A traditional trick. Cong Nianwei\u2019s face turned red and hot. Qin Guan finished the heart and wrote his name inside it before throwing the cobblestone full force into the sea. Then he turned around and said, \"My heart is in front of you for the taking.\" He suddenly quivered. Is that what a human being would say? I spoke too spontaneously. He stole a glance at Cong Nianwei. Huh? It's working! Cong Nianwei smiled at Qin Guan, who looked perturbed.</p><br/><p>She walked up to the twisted heart and drew something with her white, glittering foot. A twisted small peach appeared next to the larger peach. When Qin Guan reluctantly moved his eyes from her foot, Cong Nianwei smiled back happily and held out her hand. \"Understand?\" Qin Guan held her soft hand and nodded seriously. \"Understand!\"</p><br/><p>The two of them left the beach. Taking advantage of their absence, Zhou Jing and Li Jian ran over. As they looked at the two pictures on the beach, which had not been washed away by the waves at the time, they both expressed their doubts.</p><br/><p>\"The painting style of the two peaches is so different. It's weird.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's like the difference between an academic discussion and a kindergarten doodle!\" They were shocked by the peaches. The two bachelors were too bored to peep at the lovers anymore though. We\u2019d better go run the stand.</p><br/><p>As the sun rose, visitors came to the beach in twos or threes. Zhou Jing and Li Jian forgot to make fun of Qin Guan and got back to work.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei and Qin Guan were idling on the beach. Qin Guan took a bottle of soda water with ease, opened the cap, and handed it to Cong Nianwei. Then he opened a deck chair and put it under the umbrella.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, would you like to swim?\" Cong Nianwei asked him out of the blue as she lay comfortably in the chair. Zhou Jing and Li Jian's ears stood on end immediately. Excited, Qin Guan asked, \"Did you bring a swimsuit with you? I have some good ones here for sale.\"</p><br/><p>Smiling, Cong Nianwei shook her backpack before Qin Guan. \"My swimsuit is in my bag.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was over the moon as he nodded like crazy. \"I can swim as far as the shark net!\" I can still turn this date around. I love you, Cong Nianwei!</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing and Li Jian were happy as well. Do you really wonder why? What boy does not slobber before the pictures of female beauties? Those two had a real beauty in front of them!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei put her backpack on and bought a swimming ticket from the booth. Then she entered the changing room. Her excited boyfriend began to ransack the shelf. Shall I wear three-corner pants? No, I\u2019ll look like a conservative boy. Shall I go with boxers? This pair is too colorful and showy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finally chose a simple black pair of swimming trunks. Zhou Jing shouted from beside him, \"Great! Another pair is sold. Thank you, Qin Guan, for supporting our business!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan kicked Zhou Jing with his foot. Holding the swimming trunks, he greeted the woman in the booth and went in the men's room to change. He took all his clothes off fast, changed into the swimming trunks and went outside.</p><br/><p>Not long after, Cong Nianwei walked out of the changing room. She was wearing a conservative one-piece swimsuit with a sunflower pattern. There was a petal-like lace around the cuffs, and the lower hem was a skirt made of green sunflower leaves.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had tied her hair into a bun, which was convenient for swimming. Her fine, smooth white neck was exposed, and the fitting swimsuit outlined the girl's beautiful figure.</p><br/><p>She is a B-cup. No, they're actually bigger, but smaller than a C-cup. Qin Guan entered his wicked mode at once. As Cong Nianwei was walking towards him, the shy expression on her face made him dizzy.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei stole a glance at him. She felt shier as she saw his broad shoulders, slim waist and slender legs. Qin Guan held Cong Nianwei with a quivering hand and shouted at Zhou Jing and Li Jian behind them, \"Take care of our stand!\" Then the two of them rushed into the water. My girlfriend will be safe in the sea, away from other observers.</p><br/><p>They ran happily in the sea, the waves touching their legs. It was a little bit cold. Qin Guan held Cong Nianwei as he asked her, \"Have you warmed up? Watch the waves.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei nodded. \"Yes, I warmed up in the changing room.\"</p><br/><p>His orderly girlfriend made him feel pressured. Embarrassed, Qin Guan murmured, \"Wait for me to warm up.\"</p><br/><p>He stood in the shallow waters with both arms on his hips, turning his head around in all four directions. His waist looked fit between his hands.</p><br/><p>The surrounding tourists, who were playing on the sand, swimming in the sea or lying on the beach, unconsciously paid attention to the tall young man with the excellent figure.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The had divided their sphere of influence clearly, and those who dared make trouble in their territory caused them to lose face. They would fight the intruders to death.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had been to the Weigongcun bar street in his past life. The street was under the influence of Wang Hailiang, the owner of the Red Star Bar.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei poked Qin Guan, \u201cDid you know the rules around here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gave her a meaningful smile and raised his eyebrows proudly. He held her soft hand and told her, \u201cSit back and watch the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was just starting to feel proud when a man from Wang Hailiang\u2019s table came over, holding a cigarette in his mouth. He knocked on Qin Guan\u2019s table. \u201cYoung guy, is this your affair?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked up, a mouthful of beer sprinkling out from his nostrils. It was Bu Qinglu, the bum child beside the Landai Bar.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan coughed while Bu Qinglu continued, \u201cWell done! I see you have a new girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Qin Guan coughed more heavily. Cong Nianwei turned her head and pinched Qin Guan\u2019s leg.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan immediately explained to Bu Qinlu, \u201cYou must have made a mistake, brother. The girl you saw last time was my student. This is my girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu patted Qin Guan\u2019s shoulder in understanding and asked, \u201cEvery time I come across you, you\u2019re in trouble. What happened this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could explain, Wang Hailiang came over, his golden chain swaying as he walked. He greeted Bu Qinglu and then said, \u201cWhat's going on? Do you know him? Where\u2019s he from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu pressed his cigarette into the ashtray and lit another two for Wang Hailiang and himself. \u201cThis young man must have heard of you and your bar. He used you to protect himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled shyly at them. Wang Hailiang looked quite proud as he asked Qin Guan, \u201cWhere are you from, young man? Have you heard of my reputation? You sure are giving me face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded quickly. \u201cBrother Wang, I study at the Capital University of Finance and Economics. I just sought your help when I was in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang turned around and asked in confusion, \u201cIs there some kind of society in that university?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu was speechless with his IQ. \u201cHe says he\u2019s a student at that university, but he must have known you from somewhere. The boy is interesting, to say the least.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang laughed loudly and clapped on the table. He gave Qin Guan the thumbs-up. \u201cBoy, you must be a top student. Alright, if you trust me, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Gun hastened to nod and reply, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll buy you a drink. Thank you for helping me today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit! You don\u2019t need to pay in my bar. This is my treat.\u201d Qin Guan smiled again. He paid obeisance to Bu Qinglu and Wang Hailiang by cupping one hand into the other in front of his chest. The two of them went off to do something.</p><br/><p>Not long after, two bottles of Budweiser and a can of Coke were served to his table. He also got a box of popcorn as a gift from a smiling waiter.</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang released the two men. He let them go with a warning, but kept their clubs. They both looked innocent while they ran away.</p><br/><p>What on earth just happened? This doesn\u2019t make any sense. There had been tens of people with us, but only the two of us were left. The guy who called us disappeared. We shall not forgive him!</p><br/><p>The two of them joined the club of people wanting to beat Guli\u2019s ex-boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his beer and realized that it was late. He bought a hamburger and a spicy drumstick at the McDonald\u2019s across the street, and then hailed down a taxi to send Cong Nianwei back to campus.</p><br/><p>When Cong Nianwei opened the door, Qin Guan suddenly embraced her from behind, comforting her, \u201cLittle Wei, don't be afraid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei stamped on Qin Guan's foot and got in the taxi. She waved her fist at Qin Guan while she shut the door.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan massaged his foot as he watched the Xiali taxi drive off. He was both in pain and happy at the same time.</p><br/><p>Nearly all the taxis in the capital had changed. The yellow minibuses had retreated to the rural-urban area, leaving the urban area to the red Xiali cars. Qin Guan stuck his hands into his pockets, humming random songs as he walked back to college lazily.</p><br/><p>Wang Lei poked his head from behind a trash can in a residential area half a block away from college. He looked around and found nobody there. The street was silent.</p><br/><p>Wang Lei stood up and threw off a vegetable leaf hanging from his head. Where are you, you annoying cat? Why are you looking for food in a trash can while I\u2019m hiding there?</p><br/><p>The human and the cat were at a stalemate, the trash can the only thing separating them. When Qin Guan arrived, he found Wang Lei staring at the cat angrily.</p><br/><p>He shouted at Wang Lei from afar, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Did you just escape?\u201d Ignoring the cat, Wang Lei walked with Qin Guan back to campus. \u201cI threw them off. Why are you alone? I was waiting here, but I didn\u2019t see the others passing by.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan told Wang Lei, \u201cLet's wait for them in the dormitory. What\u2019s that smell coming from you?\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that smell? It\u2019s the smell of a trash can.</p><br/><p>By the time Wang Lei finished washing in the bathroom and returned to their dormitory, Liu Xiao Yang, Mu Lejiang and Ye Dong had also returned. The only one missing was Li Jian.</p><br/><p>His roommates were starting to worry about him. They owed their successful escape to Li Jian, who had attracted most of their enemy's hatred. He was weak physically, but his spirit was brave.</p><br/><p>The leader\u2019s hostility had been focused mainly on him, so the pursuers must have chased him relentlessly.</p><br/><p>They were just thinking about looking for Li Jian outside when he came back, humming a nameless tune. He looked safe and sound. There was only some soil on his clothes.</p><br/><p>After throwing the soil balls with the stones inside, he had observed his surroundings and escaped fast to the taxi stop at the crossing not far from there.</p><br/><p>The strong-looking man had been ashamed and angry. He had fixed his eyes on the taxi, which had been about to start. Luck only favoured the well-prepared. Li Jian got in a taxi successfully, and drove around for a while before returning to college. After dinner, he slowly returned to their dormitory.</p><br/><p>Sitting in their dormitory, they looked at each other and burst into laughter. This had been some dramatic girl-chasing, but the outcome had been spectacular. Not long after, the phone in the dormitory rang.</p><br/><p>Mu Lejiang and Ayimina had an intimate conversation. They actually became a couple while Ye Dong confessed that he preferred girls from Northeast China.</p><br/><p>They are all sensible young guys! Qin Guan thought to himself. With so many clever boys around, he felt some pressure. Although they were freshmen, they were already considering the chance of a long-distance relationship.</p><br/><p>The affair faded in time, adding an interesting experience to their college life.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was really busy. His weekends were occupied by Professor Li. He had stepped into the windiest learning stage of artistic conception, atmosphere and idea, which demanded the student's own understanding. Retentive memory didn't work at the time. It all depended on personal understanding.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

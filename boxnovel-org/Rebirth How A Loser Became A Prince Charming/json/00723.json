A lawyer! I'm his assistant. I know nothing! I was just accompanying him! Believe me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\"</p><br/><p>It was certainly interesting to see a lawyer visit an alley at night. According to the residents, he had been there several times lately.</p><br/><p>\"Good! People in societies should communicate with each other. Questions and answers are the key to eternal harmony. So, my second question is, what were you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>\"We were here for the contract.\"</p><br/><p>\"What contract?\"</p><br/><p>\"A housing transaction.\"</p><br/><p>\"Transaction with whom? And who is your employer?\"</p><br/><p> \"We are representatives of Wanda Group. We want to negotiate with the residents about their houses.\"</p><br/><p>The assistant told them everything he knew, holding nothing back. The lawyer was surprised by the honest, cowardly man. If this had been the Anti-Japanese War Era, he would have been a traitor. The enemy wouldn't even have needed to bribe him.</p><br/><p>Their opponents knew everything about them, while they had no idea about their identity.</p><br/><p>The lawyer sighed, pushing several ideas out of his mind. A forced smile suddenly formed on his face. The residents were uncertain about the truth.</p><br/><p>\"Impossible!\" Most of the people there were really poor and unsatisfied with their unreasonable offer. No one actually wanted to stay there.</p><br/><p>\"No one would choose these poor houses over new apartments!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Liars! We were so polite with them. They deserve a sound thrashing!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was burning with rage. The assistant was so scared that he fell down. The lawyer sighed again. Then he looked up and lifted his hand like a pupil in class.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me!\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is telling the truth. This is about Grandpa Jia, who lives in No. 383. Everyone in this area knows him. People call him Jia Laosan.\"</p><br/><p>When he mentioned the person by name, the residents were almost convinced.</p><br/><p>\"Really? Jia Laosan?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's true. My name is Chen Kang, and I'm the director of Chen Kang Law Firm. Wanda Group entrusted me with the real estate contracts and legal consulting of this area.\"</p><br/><p>Then he suddenly seemed to recall something. He took out a fine silver card holder from his pocket and handed out cards to everyone.</p><br/><p>\"My expertise is financial and civil cases.\"</p><br/><p>The man could deal with a temporary setback, which explained how he could take on such a big case.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a card with his slender fingers. He found the man very interesting.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I have one last question. If you came here to negotiate about a contract, you must have some documents in your bag, in case the residents were in a good enough mood to sign. Am I right?\"</p><br/><p>He waved the card at Chen Kang with a naughty smile. The lawyer felt like fleeing.</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" he said, nodding without hesitation. Qin Guan smiled again and stretched his hand out towards the young lawyer.</p><br/><p>\"Show me then!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt really bold and confident. Everyone around, except the two unlucky men, nodded in unison. Show us!</p><br/><p>No one could help the men under these circumstances. Chen Kang kicked his crouching assistant. \"Give me the bag!\"</p><br/><p>The assistant didn't move. He was trembling in horror. Chen Kang sighed for a third time. \"You can take the bag yourselves. The contracts are inside.\"</p><br/><p>Soon, a thick pile of documents was handed to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the room again as Qin Guan read the papers as fast as he could. Five minutes later, he finished the contracts and handed them to an old man next to him.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Kang is not messing with us, Grandpa Yang. He is a lawyer. Grandpa Jia has signed a contract with him to sell his house, but the price is different from the one they offered you. It's actually double.\"</p><br/><p>\"He also exchanged his house based on the area. He can get six square meters by the North Fifth Ring Road for one square meter in this area!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

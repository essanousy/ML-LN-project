In your eyes, I'm just an ordinary person made of flesh and blood. I wanted to express my appreciation to you, Guo. I hope you stay like this forever. Never be kind to me or fall in love with me, or I'll be disappointed in you.\"</p><br/><p>What a shameless guy! The words coming out of Qin Guan's mouth did not sound strange though. He seemed to be enjoying telling the truth.</p><br/><p>The man was like an embroidered pillow stuffed with straw. He couldn't stand pain. He hit his forehead against a pillar while pretending to be all majestic and fearless.</p><br/><p>Bang! Everyone thought he was a really dedicated actor. Qin Guan launched a dart, displaying the ultimate skill of the Qin family.</p><br/><p>His long hair was flying in the air beautifully. Thanks to his performance, the serious atmosphere suddenly became funny. Some people burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Director Shang pointed to the camera and explained to the other actors, \"See? A good actor should not just be able to express delicate feelings. Isn't he a handsome man?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you laughing at him then? He's just a handsome man delivering some ordinary lines. Why did you burst into laughter? It was because of his power of interpretation. He knows how to express himself comically.\"</p><br/><p>\"He is just like Xu Zheng. Did you watch his film 'Crazy Stone'? His role had no dramatic lines, but he combined other characters, scenes and storylines to create a strong comic effect. I think all comedians should learn from him.\"</p><br/><p>\"To be frank, if we want to attract an audience, we should be focusing on the quality of our work. It's not that easy to create a good comedy.\"</p><br/><p>Thank you, director. That was a compliment, right?</p><br/><p>After more than six months, the end of the show was finally drawing near. The show was a common achievement they had overcome a lot of difficulties for. The director was proud of every actor.</p><br/><p>Everyone entered the set passionately and got ready for the final scene. They were in the hall of the Tongfu Inn. In case of trouble, everyone would say \"Have a good meal!\" to fool the customers.</p><br/><p>That day, the customers were played by crew members who had some time off. They all assumed their original positions, except for one person who was actually a newcomer.</p><br/><p>It was Qin Tengyun, who had replaced Yan Xiaoliu. He sat down in the middle of the table, while all the other members of the Tongfu Inn sat down around him. It was time for supper, a relaxing, celebratory time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan poured water into a bowl from a liquor jar. His conversation with Sha Ye would be a tough test.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was playing a man who had lost his confidence in his abilities because of a mistake he had made 10 years ago. He had been suffering for an entire decade.</p><br/><p>As he stared at Sha Yi, Qin Guan seemed to recall that memory. He was handsome, but he was completely lost in his own world.</p><br/><p>All he could do was express his feelings about his wrong choice.</p><br/><p>\"It was you who harmed me!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm only a thief. How could I possibly harm a constable?\"</p><br/><p>\"When I was a child, my father told me that we should catch thieves at any price. One day, I tried to shoot your left eye, but you caught my dart! A thief was protecting a hostage, while I, a constable, was about to hurt a hostage in my effort to catch a thief!\"</p><br/><p>The man had lost his confidence ever since. Without the correct guidance of his family, he had lost his way completely. Thus, the boy had been chasing Bai Zhantang, the thief who had affected him so deeply, for 10 years in order to put an end to that confusing incident.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he had underestimated Bai Zhantang. The same scene took place again in that hall after 10 years. This time, Qin Guan caught Tong Xiangyu by the neck and seized the stone Bai had thrown at her left eye.</p><br/><p>He was finally satisfied with himself. He now knew that this was a normal human reaction that was neither right nor wrong.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

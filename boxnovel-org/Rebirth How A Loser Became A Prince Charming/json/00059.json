They discussed it and finally decided to take a photo from his knees up.</p><br/><p>A nude picture would be even better. Sister Xue asked Qin Guan to take off his coat and expose his abdominal muscles and V-line. She unfastened the first button of his jeans and pulled them down a little. Perfect! They would lure the audience with his sexy body. It was so cunning!</p><br/><p>When the photos were finished, as a sophisticated lady who had seen countless beauties, Sister Xue believed that she would have been fascinated by Qin Guan. She counted 10 bills and handed them to the photographer, who had cooperated with her gladly. \"Thank you! You\u2019re welcome back anytime.\"</p><br/><p>Once he finished the post-production, the photographer would call Sister Xue. Until then, Qin Guan could relax. A lot of affairs had come up recently, and Qin Guan had been busy as a bee. Now he could finally make some testing papers for Huang Jiajia.</p><br/><p>In June, Huang Jiajia would take her final examinations, and in September, when the schools opened again, she would join the army for the College Entrance Examination.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had promised Huang Jiajia at the end of the Spring Festival that if her scores were improved in the General Examination, he would treat her to snacks at Carrefour. There was only about 800 yuan left in his shopping card, but hopefully it would be enough for her highness. In half a year, she had changed a lot. His courses were much easier for her than they used to be. Huang Jiajia was no longer a rebel, but a very smart lady.</p><br/><p>Her vigor in studying shamed Qin Guan. She had asked her mother to register for several lessons after school. As she corrected her mistakes, she had attracted the attention of her teachers at school. A hard-working student was welcome everywhere, even in a school with a low enrolment rate. As a result, the teachers had begun to focus on Huang Jiajia both in and out of class. By getting help from both sides, Huang Jiajia\u2019s scores had been getting better and better.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his dormitory and worked on the papers for Huang Jiagia during his leisure time. He would test her that weekend.</p><br/><p>Before the weekend, Qin Guan\u2019s date request was turned down by Cong Nianwei once again. Irritated by his roommates\u2019 displays of affection in the dormitory, Qin Guan took the papers and headed for Huang Jiajia's home to avoid beating his friends up.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered Huang Jiajia's home and found her sitting at the table quietly with her pen and draft paper. This will be my last chance to earn his praise. It was their last lesson before the General Examinations and the finals. It was showdown.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spread the papers on the table. \"My papers include less subjects than your examination. Luckily, these courses are focusing on memory. You can work on them yourself. Today we\u2019ll focus on the five main subjects. Let's start with Chinese.\" Huang Jiajia nodded eagerly and picked up the first paper. Lowering her head, she began to write quickly. Meanwhile, Qin Guan read a book beside her.</p><br/><p>June was drawing near, and the temperature was getting higher and higher, signalling the arrival of summer vacation. However, before the summer holidays, students had to go through the examination period.</p><br/><p>There was also a heated competition for the scholarship that semester. For Qin Guan, who had a balance of more than 30,000 yuan, that scholarship was still a large source of income. All that money was his reward for working hard and his capital for launching his business. As a young man, I can only gradually accumulate a limited capital.</p><br/><p>The leaves outside the windows rustled in the breeze as an early summer cicada sang along, joining their private celebration.</p><br/><p>Under the yellow lights inside the house, two figures were sitting at a table. One of them was writing swiftly while the other was reading carefully. What a peaceful time!</p><br/><p>When Huang Jiajia finished writing, Qin Guan looked up from his book. He corrected her papers with a red ballpoint pen as Huang Jiajia craned her neck to look, sitting on pins and needles.</p><br/><p>The test would reflect her level in the General Examination in a way, and the result of the General Examination would affect her chances of getting treated to snacks by Qin Guan and dating him. Actually, Huang Jiajia was over-thinking things. The General Examination would only cover the most basic knowledge points of the textbooks.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan was done, Huang Jiajia was pleased by the results.</p><br/><p>Chinese: 98</p><br/><p>Math: 88</p><br/><p>English: 92</p><br/><p>Chemistry: 90</p><br/><p>Science: 91</p><br/><p>Except for Math, all her other scores were above 90. Her total score was 459, which meant that she could possibly enroll at a community college.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia was really excited. Although she hadn\u2019t passed Math, she had made great progress. She was just thinking of acting like a spoiled child and begging Qin Guan for praise, when he looked at his watch and stood up. It was not early for him, so he planned to leave. They would meet again after Huang Jiajia had taken the General Examination.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia was both angry and disappointed. Qin Guan\u2019s mind was occupied by his courses, his part-time jobs and Cong Nianwei, so she had failed to find a way in.</p><br/><p>She threw her teddy bear on the floor with force. I hate him and love him at the same time! He\u2019s such a simple-minded man, both in my reach and out of it... As Huang Jiajia thought about how she had gotten along with Qin Guan, she picked up her teddy bear again and held it in her arms.</p><br/><p>Unaware that he had broken her young heart, Qin Guan was riding his shabby bicycle on his way back to college. Huang Jiajia\u2019s good scores had given him a sense of achievement that had healed the wound caused by Cong Nianwei. He parked his bike and returned to his dormitory with his books.</p><br/><p>All his roommates were studying inside. What cunning boys! They pretended to be at ease in the classroom, but reverted to their original status when they came back home. They were the most annoying students in the whole college. They acted relaxed before others, smiling about their high scores as they said, \"It was unexpected! I was only listening to the tutor randomly. How could I have gotten such a high score?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

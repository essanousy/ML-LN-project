There were stage players, drama actors and indie film extras. Most of them were not professional actors.</p><br/><p>They all loved indie films though. Some had even accepted the roles for free. Qin Guan got an even more extensive understanding of the foreign film circle. In his dream, all Chinese actors possessed such awareness, and the directors of the sixth generation were crying tears of joy.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that it was only a dream. Qin Guan woke up in the small hotel. Suddenly, he was enlightened. He knew why that scene was so familiar.</p><br/><p>Although it was another country, it really looked like the alleys of Shanghai. The doors of the different houses were close to each other, and ordinary everyday life was a trap for passion and ambition.</p><br/><p>Young Argentinians were eager to escape that small world. They wanted to see a larger, more splendid world.</p><br/><p>Feeling the joy of the city, Qin Guan washed his face and recovered from the previous exhausting day. Then he joined the shooting energetically.</p><br/><p>They were shooting the final scene of the movie, where the whole spirit of the film lay.</p><br/><p>They were in the same underwear store, but the boss of the stationery store across the street was now his father. Looking for a chance to get closer to Qin Guan, the old man had bought the store, which had been under bad management at the time.</p><br/><p>The stubborn young man rejected the familiar stranger. Ashamed, his mother couldn't help but tell the truth when she saw how they got along.</p><br/><p>Actually, his father hadn't abandoned him. His mother and the previous owner of the stationery store had had an affair. His father was the one who had been abandoned.</p><br/><p>This was not a story about love, but about the difference between dreams and reality. Upon finding out the truth, Qin Guan went out of the underwear store, which he had considered his prison, for the first time. He went into the horrible stationery store, where his father was.</p><br/><p>\"Final scene! The embrace. Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Director Luchant blew the horn. After more than half a month, the film would come to an end. He felt like a mother holding her baby after carrying it for nine months.</p><br/><p>All the onlookers were watching them quietly. This was the final scene between the talented Asian actor and George.</p><br/><p>\"Dad...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan uttered the strange word with a shaking voice. The expression in his eyes was anxious, ashamed, excited and sad all at once.</p><br/><p>The father and son looked at each other with deep emotion inside the empty store. After drifting for so many years, the lonely old man had finally reached his destination.</p><br/><p>The wrinkles on George's face were twisted. No words or facial expressions could express his delight and comfort.</p><br/><p>They walked over to each other, their bodies coming close naturally. The person they had longed for their whole lives was right in front of them. They opened their arms wide.</p><br/><p>I love you, dad. Always.</p><br/><p>I love you, son. Always.</p><br/><p>The young man and the old man hugged each other. Although it was only a half-embrace instead of the tight one Qin Guan had imagined, he still loved it. Sometimes, incomplete things were perfect. One cherished something more after losing it.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, in materialistic societies, people are filled with fickle thoughts, but an ordinary life and true emotions are one\u2019s real destination.</p><br/><p>Tears appeared on both of their eyes. Their warm emotions made even the directors, who had experienced many ups and downs in life, tear up.</p><br/><p>The final scene was a miracle created by those two actors.</p><br/><p>The cameras slowly stopped. Everyone looked at each other and said together, \"Wonderful!\"</p><br/><p> \"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and George kept hugging each other. At the director\u2019s order, Qin Guan's snot spilled out.</p><br/><p>George was not angry. He rubbed his face on Qin Guan's shoulder instead.</p><br/><p>\"Snot and tears. We are even now...\"</p><br/><p>Laughing, they embraced each other again. \"Thank you for your support. I want to thank both the director for this chance and you for your guidance.\"</p><br/><p> There were predestined relationships among people. In Qin Guan's opinion, this was the most lovely crew he had worked with.</p><br/><p>At the airport, he watched the Batiste brothers and the two Argentinian girls say goodbye to each other with extreme sorrow while he talked about his next auditions with Qu Xuemei on the phone.</p><br/><p>He told everyone goodbye and flew to Hawaii alone.</p><br/><p>He had some auditions there. Then he would return to New York to join the Columbia visiting group. Qu focused on his final task, making good use of his schedule like the famous Eugenie Grandet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

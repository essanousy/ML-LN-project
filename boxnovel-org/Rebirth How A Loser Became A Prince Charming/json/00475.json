Qin Guan closed the door, and they took a seat. Qin Guan waited until Qingmu had calmed down completely.</p><br/><p>\"Tell me, Mr. Qingmu. What\u2019s the purpose of your visit?\"</p><br/><p>Placing both hands on his knees, Qingmu took a deep bow before Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Yamaguchi-gumi came to Citizen, inquiring about why you didn\u2019t show up in our 2003 advertisement. As the director, I had to explain to them. Yamaguchi-gumi was not satisfied with my answer though and proposed to replace our representative.\"</p><br/><p>\"Citizen could have rejected that unreasonable requirement. They are powerful, but they never exert violence on formal companies.\"</p><br/><p>\"You became really successful in America though. You won the Cannes Best Actor Award and became renowned internationally through the fake news scandal. The Citizen board feels deeply regretful. Taking advantage of Yamaguchi-gumi, the headquarters pinned all the responsibility on me. They broke their contract with Chad and asked me to convince you to be our representative again.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m the arch criminal here. I have to appease both the gangsters and the board. If I fail, I\u2019ll lose my job and die silently...\"</p><br/><p>The proud Japanese man started crying again, burying his face in his hands. A man\u2019s tears were reserved only for true sorrow.</p><br/><p>Yamaguchi Tsutomu was the favorite of the head of Yamaguchi-gumi. Among all his children, she was the only one he had raised himself. He was not sad about the terrible events in New York, but he was worried about the girl getting lost in the city. Only when she had returned to Japan was he able to relax again. </p><br/><p>As a loyal man, he had decided to pay Qin Guan back for saving her life.</p><br/><p>\"Did Citizen fire Mr. Qin?\" Yamaguchi Tsutomu had commented randomly while reading through Qin Guan\u2019s resume.</p><br/><p>Her father remembered that. I have to clarify this. How dare Citizen fire her lifesaver? All those coincidences had resulted in this predicament.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who had no idea about this, felt troubled.</p><br/><p>\"I would like to help you, but my schedule in North America is arranged by my agent. It's difficult to change my contract. Besides, I have my own work to take care of. Look...\" Qin Guan pointed to the office outside. \"This is my new accounting firm. I\u2019m too busy with work.\"</p><br/><p>Yes, Qin Guan was no longer a nobody searching for a job. He was already a top model. People had to wait in line for an appointment with him.</p><br/><p>\"Besides, you are aware of the uniqueness of representative work. I wonder if my agent has signed a contract with some other watch brand. If she has, I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t help you.\"</p><br/><p>Qingmu had no time to pretend anymore. He bounced up and took another deep bow. \"Please introduce me to your agent. Please!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed. It\u2019s no trouble for me. I\u2019ll just help him.</p><br/><p>They went out and saw everyone gathered around the door curiously. They did not look embarrassed about their eagerness to gossip.</p><br/><p>\"What's going on? What can we do for you?\"</p><br/><p>\"In my opinion, this depends on Mr. Qin. It is better for the doer to undo what he has done.\"</p><br/><p>That was very reasonable.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the guidance of the master, Qingmu felt confident again. If I fail, I could just run for my life.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan explained to Cong Nianwei about the matter and left the office with Qingmu. They drove to Qu's temporary office.</p><br/><p>Xu was totally convinced by the master, while Lan cast a supercilious look at Xu.</p><br/><p>Qu was not surprised by Qin Guan's call. Taking advantage of this, she arranged appointments with several top brands for that day.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Qingmu, who had no idea about the situation, were led to the largest meeting room of the VOGUE headquarters, where all kinds of people were seated. It looked like a small-scale international conference.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Qingmu were invited into the room. Qu waved at Qin Guan, while the representatives of different brands were itching to get a clear look at the charming man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

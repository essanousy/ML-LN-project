You can!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lan_ Editor: Efydatia</p><br/><p>F*ck! I'm so lucky I will not have to cooperate with her in the film, or I'd get sick. She is just lusting after a handsome guy! What does he feel though?</p><br/><p>She was suddenly distracted when everyone walked around the set to stress the importance of the scene. They would kiss each other soon!</p><br/><p>The couple was lying on a wide wooden bed used by old-fashioned Chinese women. Qin Guan's mother had kept it in the simple cottage.</p><br/><p>The girl was lying before Qin Guan. They were so close to each other that when he bent down towards her, his nose touched hers. They couldn't restrain their desire to kiss anymore.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan preferred gentle kisses, but Xu and the director favored more heated emotions.</p><br/><p>The girl, who had experienced a heavy stormwave in Japan, locked her arms around his neck. A long French kiss followed. The couple was absorbed into the kiss as their lips and teeth met again and again.</p><br/><p>The only unhappy person around was Li Bingbing. In a film with two heroines, two good actresses would put pressure on one another. As the scene progressed, Li's nerves were stimulated.</p><br/><p>She was eager to see her future, as well as the development of the Chinese film circle. The pace of people's lives was currently picking up. There was no time for an actress to study and improve. The entertainment circle changed every day, so a younger actress would replace her soon.</p><br/><p>Film snobs and producers would never choose her as a heroine because of her experience or acting skills. Li Bingbing was in terrible need of an award in order to improve her position in the film circle. After so many years in the job, she was actually nervous about her career.</p><br/><p>She didn't want to be like Fan Pingping. She just wanted to show the audience her abilities.</p><br/><p>She could see the potential of the film, which involved both a soul-stirring story and an impressive romance, and she really looked forward to promoting it.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the film included two heroines, which meant that the two actresses would compete and the audience would make comparisons.</p><br/><p>As the shooting went on, the Taiwanese actress followed Qin Guan's instructions and performed better and better.</p><br/><p>When the last scene was over, Qin Guan dropped his wet towel on Li's head. He had just been crying in the rain.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"You are still the active girl I used to know. You are not one to sit in a corner. I know what you are worried about. What do you think of my proposal?\"</p><br/><p>\"What proposal?\" Li threw the wet towel away. Qin Guan's confident eyes calmed her down.</p><br/><p>\"Just let it be. Believe in yourself. No domestic actress your age is better than you. Don't mention Sister Zhou. You are too stupid to be compared to her.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is actually your advantage. You will finally become a shining star. Never compare yourself to anyone else, especially talented actors like me. Just compare yourself with your previous self and improve every day. That will be enough.\"</p><br/><p>\"What you need is only a chance. Everything is in your hands. Never give up!\"</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing burst into laughter. At first, she had been angry with Qin Guan, but then she fell into deep thought. Suddenly, an endless power exploded out of her body.</p><br/><p>Yes, she had never surrendered before.</p><br/><p>She would make sure she didn't in the village of Liaoning either. It was her turn now. The crew recreated a battlefield in aid of Korea that worked in the resistance against the US aggression. The annoying Taiwanese woman was gone, even though a city filled with sand and storms would have felt like home to her.</p><br/><p>The set was built according to the memories of old soldiers and some remaining military sites. In order to show the cultural and geographical environment of the times better, they were shooting in the Northeastern China countryside in early spring.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put on his costume, which was a khaki military cotton-padded jacket with a belt around the waist. Anyone would look ugly in that outfit.</p><br/><p>He and Li Bingbing met for the first time during a battle operation. Their meeting was not as beautiful as the one with his first love.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a military doctor who had been working nonstop for 20 hours and now had to perform surgery on an annoying patient. He had just saved a patient with a large belly wound, who had been murmuring to himself in pain. The girl lying before him was crying and rolling around, as if she was on the verge of death.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

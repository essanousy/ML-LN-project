She walked up to him politely and said, \"You are so lucky, Mr. Qin Guan. We also have blue and yellow diamonds of the same quality as this pink one. They are as beautiful as the sky!\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? But this one is too small.\"</p><br/><p>Susanna felt the impulse to hit him.</p><br/><p>Small? Did you even take into consideration the ordinary people who only buy 0.3-0.5 carat wedding rings?</p><br/><p>As everyone knew, when the weight was doubled, the price was multiplied by 10. Ordinary people might be able to afford one carat, but any stone heavier than 2 carats cost millions of yuan.</p><br/><p>Some rich ladies showed off their four-carat diamonds online and called them \"dove eggs\".</p><br/><p>To a professional of the jewellery industry though, the customer was always right. Thus, the woman put on her sincerest smile and told Qin Guan, \"You are indeed a lucky man, Mr. Qin. The largest and finest diamond of them all has remained intact. The headquarters have decided to make it our most important product in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? How much does it weigh?\"</p><br/><p>\"19.8 carats.\"</p><br/><p>\"And how much does it cost?\"</p><br/><p>\"Several million dollars.\"</p><br/><p>\"Deal!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026 I can't make that kind of decision.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then contact the person in charge for me. No jewellery brand can turn away so much money.\"</p><br/><p>Susanna gave him a glassy-eyed stare. Although the deal could be considered her achievement, she was not delighted about it.</p><br/><p>Thus, Cartier not only sold the stone to Qin Guan, but also designed the ring for him, under the condition that the bride would show it to the public and the brand's name would be noted under every picture.</p><br/><p>Tiffany was furious about the deal. Qin Guan was their brand ambassador after all. This was humiliating for them!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was annoyed by their endless fighting. In the end, the three sides reached the agreement that Tiffany would design his ring. That way, the two designs would become a legend in the industry.</p><br/><p>It was a win-win situation. The two brands got to work. This job was a celebration of top jewellery that involved the best materials, designers and handicraft, so it was breaking news for the media.</p><br/><p>The two sides stopped fighting immediately, got up from the ground, brushed the dust off their clothes and shook hands...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put the last document into the small safe in the wall gently. This was his personal secret. He was planning on keeping it from his woman until the very last minute.</p><br/><p>Before leaving for New York, Qin Guan attended the Oscars in an effort to support Director Zhang Yimou. He hadn't gotten an invitation, but when the staff saw him in the crowd, they asked him to walk on the red carpet. Actually, that year's ceremony included almost no Asian films, with the exception of Zhang Yimou's film.</p><br/><p>When they stepped on the red carpet together, all the reporters were shocked.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>They took out their programs to confirm their suspicions.</p><br/><p>\"He has no reason to be here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. His film was nominated for an award, but he wasn't.\"</p><br/><p>\"Did the organizing committee invite him at the last minute?\"</p><br/><p>\"Does this mean that he could possibly win an award?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's big news!\"</p><br/><p>\"But he only played a supporting character in the film.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is discrimination! Supporting actors can also win an Oscar!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

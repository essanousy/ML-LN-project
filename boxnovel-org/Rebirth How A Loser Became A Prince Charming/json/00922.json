How are you, everyone? Most of you must be familiar with my face. I'm He Ming, one of the founders of the club.\"</p><br/><p>He Ming showed up regularly at parties and other activities of the club. Most of the guests were good friends of his, so his joke earned some positive feedback.</p><br/><p>\"He! We are tired of you. Can you surprise us this time?\"</p><br/><p>He Ming shook his head. \"No, the old rules apply. According to our rules, we'll welcome a new friend at each party. Expanding the club is our tradition.\"</p><br/><p>\"What's our other tradition?\"</p><br/><p>\"Performing!\" everyone shouted in unison. All the guests had performed all kinds of acts in the past. This was the best way for people to get close to each other. After a short performance, the newcomer would be accepted by the club as a gentleman.</p><br/><p>The lighting master adjusted the brightness of the lights.</p><br/><p>\"Today, I have a surprise for you. The newcomer is really good at performing!\"</p><br/><p>The background fell down as an answer to his words and revealed a piano and a strong man with thick eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\"Let's welcome pianist Lang Lang!\"</p><br/><p>Lang began to perform. The well-educated audience stopped talking to listen to the music. The whole ship fell silent under the starry sky.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at He, who was talking to him. He was a smart, determined man.</p><br/><p>They both drained the last drop from their cups. 'So you don't want to return to China?\"</p><br/><p>\"At least not anytime soon. Chinese enterprises have been expanding ambitiously. I'll help them through my work in foreign countries.\"</p><br/><p>Although he was living abroad, he was still concerned about his nation.</p><br/><p>Lang Lang finished his performance and received a thunderous applause.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like I'm a redneck. I only care about connections and profit. That pianist looks like someone who has just suffered an electric shock.\"</p><br/><p>Although he didn't feel ashamed for his lack of artistic taste, he clapped for the performer enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a helpless look at his friend as he clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>\"You asked me to come to the party for him?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Chinese people lead hard lives in the US, artists even more so. This is nothing for you.\"</p><br/><p>The young pianist walked over to them slowly and greeted them with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"How are you, Mr. Qin? I'm Lang Lang. I'm new here. Thank you for your support and consideration.\"</p><br/><p>\"How are you?\"</p><br/><p>The young man was surprisingly easy-going. The two of them exchanged a few words to clarify the purpose of their meeting.</p><br/><p>\"So you want my QC firm to sponsor your Grammy nomination?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"As far as I'm aware, IMG invests money specifically on promotion.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, but it is both the company's promotion and the strong sponsors that will decide the fate of the singers.\"</p><br/><p>To be honest, the outcome of the battle was determined by money.</p><br/><p>Lang Lang had joined the club with a clear aim. He wanted to get continuous support from his compatriots. This was his long-term plan of supporting his career financially.</p><br/><p>In a time when classical music didn't make much money, it was difficult for a musician, particularly an ambitious one, to support himself.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his economic power and connections in the entertainment circle, Qin Guan had become his first choice.</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>He Ming was shocked. How could an accountant like Qin Guan agree to such a bad deal? It was like throwing coins into a river!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The 80-episode TV show would be broadcast in all TV stations for a full three years.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put a satisfactory full stop to the show. Before leaving, everyone came together to have a meal. The only present Qin Guan received was a box of fruit and some vegetable juice, which had been the favorite drink of the crew during the tropical summer. It was a little weird to have it during the winter though.</p><br/><p>The shameless director didn't make any explanations. The feedback after the episode aired would be the best compensation for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Everyone was excited about the last episode. People had originally thought that Jiang Wen was an expert when it came to confidential work. \"Curse Of The Golden Flower\" hadn't been revealed to the Chinese audience yet after all.</p><br/><p>However, it had been selected by the Venice Film Festival and people had a general idea about the main cast, basic context and storyline. </p><br/><p>TV shows were more random though. They were usually shot as they were being broadcast, so people didn't know what would happen in the next episodes in advance.</p><br/><p>The last episode was a shocking surprise for everyone.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is guest starring in 'My Own Swordsman'!\"</p><br/><p>\"He just won the Outstanding Contribution Award in Tokyo!\"</p><br/><p>\"If the director went so far as to hire him, then he must be a powerful man!\"</p><br/><p>\"This is normal. It's a popular CCTV show after all. Qin Guan has always been a patriot. He has never turned down a proposal from a CCTV director.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's weird though. This is a good show, but Qin Guan is like a king among peasants, if you know what I mean...\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you implying that international award-winning actors should be arrogant? Good actors should remain humble and take the quality of their work into consideration. It would not be wise of him to turn down a limited-budget TV show just because he won a few awards.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly. Plus, Qin Guan has declared that he only judges a film by its script, not its budget. Arrogant award-winning actors and actresses can stay home.\"</p><br/><p>\"To be honest, they just pretend to be somebodies. After their popularity fades, the audience forgets about them completely.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly!\"</p><br/><p>The audience was simple-minded. As long as an actor's role pleased them, they would love them, regardless of if they portrayed a superhero or a beggar. They never took the budget or the director of a show into consideration.</p><br/><p>The Chinese audience was very tolerant when it came to good scripts and good roles.</p><br/><p>Everyone fell in love with Qin Tengyun. The audience was reluctant to part with the TV show that had accompanied them for several months.</p><br/><p>They were already looking forward to the sequel, with the hope that Qin Tengyun would appear again in the future.</p><br/><p>Reality was different though. Ning Caishen had not thought about what he would do next. Inspiration had not hit him yet. Plus, Qin Guan couldn't change his fixed schedule for such a long time. For him, it would be best for that project to end there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

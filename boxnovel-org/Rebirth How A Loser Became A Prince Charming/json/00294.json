As he looked at the delicious food in front of him though, he had no time to explain any further.</p><br/><p> Eating silently was traditional Chinese table manners. It was impolite to make indelicate sounds. In Japan though, if one sucked their noodles silently, it was an insult to the cook.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took that rule very seriously, so he buried his face in his bowl. In a few minutes, he had finished all his noodles and soup.</p><br/><p> The sweet wheat noodles, light soup and thick pork slices had all been perfect. Both his stomach and heart had warmed up.</p><br/><p> The graceful girl was shocked by his behavior. Her face looked cute and lively. Qin Guan held up his bowl and let out a long breath of satisfaction. \"Thank you for your hospitality. I\u2019m full,\" he told the owner. When in Rome\u2026 [1]</p><br/><p> Both the owner and the other customers smiled. It was a small pleasure to enjoy warm ramen in a small, warm restaurant.</p><br/><p> \"Can I have the check, please?\"</p><br/><p> When all the bowls were empty, Qin Guan took out his wallet.</p><br/><p> \"5,050 yen in total. Thank you!\"</p><br/><p> \u2026..</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stared at the smiling owner and explored his pocket. He had 5,000 yen, no more or less.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan blinked at her. The two of them went around the corner and whispered to each other.</p><br/><p> \"Can I have a discount? Just round down the total.\"</p><br/><p> \"Our business is small, and the prices are reasonable.\"</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m the latest Asian Fashion Man. I can take a photo with you. In one week, news about me will be on every magazine.\"</p><br/><p> Such a shameless guy!</p><br/><p> \"Deal! Darling, get the camera!\"</p><br/><p> \"Okay!\"</p><br/><p> The owner did as soon as possible.</p><br/><p> \"Look at me! Three, two, one\u2026 Cheese!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan hugged the woman and smiled.</p><br/><p> \"Me, too! Me, too!\" The spicy girls had spotted them.</p><br/><p> \"Together!\"</p><br/><p> They stood by the entrance as a frequent patron took their picture. Suddenly, Yamaguchi Tsutomu took Qin Guan's arm, while the owner embraced Qin Guan from the other side.</p><br/><p> It was the Ice-Flame Island come to life [2].</p><br/><p> When Sister Xue arrived at their meeting place, Qin Guan was eating small octopus balls bought by the girls. Even strangers could sense his thirst for food. </p><br/><p> They talked with each other happily, and Sister Xue discussed Qin Guan's work in Japan with the president. Yamaguchi Tsutomu listened to her with a serious expression. It would be helpful to work with her in the future.</p><br/><p> They said farewell reluctantly. Only when Qin Guan disappeared at the end of the street did Yamaguchi Tsutomu turn her gaze away. She got in a black car not far away.</p><br/><p> Sister Xue was quite curious about the girl.</p><br/><p> \"She seemed delicate, but no one ignored her. There is something special about her.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes. Nowadays, it's rare to see people in formal Japanese kimonos except during festivals or ceremonies. Oh, I remember! Her bodyguards were wearing the same brooch. It looked like a water chestnut. She must be from some big ancient family.\"</p><br/><p> \"Judging by her family name, she could be from Yamaguchi-gumi [3],\" Sister Xue joked.</p><br/><p> \"Ha ha! Impossible! She looks like a royal lady not good at expressing feelings. She has nothing to do with gangsters.\"</p><br/><p> \"That sounds reasonable. I\u2019m thinking too much.\"</p><br/><p> They returned to their rooms, and Qin Guan took a nap. After going through a long Japanese-style corridor, Yamaguchi Tsutomu also returned to her room.</p><br/><p> A strong man kneeled on the floor respectfully and pulled the sliding door open for her.</p><br/><p> The black kimono fell down to the tatami to expose her fair back. She had a large tattoo of albizia flowers. A fierce black dragon stretched from above the flowers until her bottom. She looked gorgeous in a strange, enchanting way.</p><br/><p> She put on a white kimono with the pattern of a dragon. As she pulled the sliding door open, she changed into another person. She was no longer the cold doll she was before, but a powerful leader.</p><br/><p> \"Follow me.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes!\" Her strong followers kowtowed before her. Fierce tattoos were visible under their collars as they lowered their heads.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Sister Xue\u2019s instincts always came true, especially the bad ones.</p><br/><p> The two seers were sitting in the Citizen meeting room. Zhuchuanlongfu and the other directors were sitting across from them.</p><br/><p> They were having a heated discussion about the expiring contract. Qin Guan would be leaving China soon, so it was difficult for them to renew it.</p><br/><p> Sister Xue was bargaining with them cleverly. As an agent, she had to get a general idea of Citizen's policies and development trends.</p><br/><p>[1] Japanese usually say that after dinner.</p><br/><p>[2] The girl felt cold and the boss was warm.</p><br/><p>[3] The largest Japanese gang.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

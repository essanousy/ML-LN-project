As they stood with students from other colleges, only the flag-bearers could show off or attack.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s roommates were quarrelling in the dormitory because of Ye Dong. Qin Guan had to miss a couple of interviews thanks to his behavior. He had acted first and asked questions afterwards.</p><br/><p>Each of them was an individual with a distinct personality. They had been living in the same dormitory for four years, which would be a beautiful memory for the rest of their lives.</p><br/><p>However, that didn\u2019t mean that they would bend to one person's capricious will. As an empleomaniac, Ye Dong had a clear aim, and he was taking advantage of all his resources to achieve his final goal. His roommates had been the best choice.</p><br/><p>His repeated self-assertion had damaged their friendship for the first time though.</p><br/><p>A good-tempered young man like Qin Guan felt that it was necessary to have a discussion about the problem.</p><br/><p>\"Well, Ye Dong. Better inform us next time you want to use us. We have our own schedules after all.\"</p><br/><p>\"If I tell you in advance, will you help me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes...\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay then.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan backed off close to tears. He was not that good at negotiating. Next! The strongest man from the Northwest, Mu Lejiang, came up.</p><br/><p>They stared at each other silently for several seconds before they embraced. Hey! You compromised just like that?</p><br/><p>Wang Lei, who had poor marks in PE, had nothing to do with the affair. As for Liu Xiaoyang, he had already been persuaded by Ye Dong.</p><br/><p>He was lying in bed, thinking about the professional equipment he would buy and how he would manage to shine during the sports meeting.</p><br/><p>Boy, you are all so naive. Never try to argue with a professional politician. You\u2019ll only find yourself losing.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to cry, but he had no tears left. Hugging him, Ye Dong murmured with a smile, \"No words can express my gratitude for your kindness. You may lose some opportunities because of the sports meeting, but trust me. You shouldn\u2019t give up your life on campus for work.\"</p><br/><p>\"You know, Qin Guan, if you focused more on campus life, you\u2019d be more popular than you are now. If you ran for chairman, no one would beat you. Anyway, thank you for your support. I\u2019m proud to be your roommate. I really want to spend more time with you. After one year, we will drift apart. This may be the last team activity of our dormitory. Maybe my way was not convenient, but I was just too anxious to express my love. Would you please accept my sincere apology?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt like crying. I\u2019m so popular in my dormitory. His words really moved me.</p><br/><p>Wang Lei looked at his emotional roommate speechlessly. He was too easy to make sentimental. Compared to Liu Xiaoyang though, who was choking from sobbing too hard, Qin Guan did not seem to be the worst one.</p><br/><p>It was a sunny day in May, and there was a commotion at Renmin University.</p><br/><p>Led by Ye Dong, a delegation from the Capital University of Finance and Economics participated in the sports meeting.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan walked into the court in white sportswear holding the red flag of his college, the audience was shocked.</p><br/><p>They couldn't accept that their own emcee girl was inferior to the boy in white.</p><br/><p>They read the sign carefully. Were they kidding? It was not a drama or music academy, but an economic college.</p><br/><p>That boy could live on his looks, yet he was just competing with them as a straight-A student. People enrolled at art colleges with a score of just over 300. How could people who had to live on their IQ survive then?</p><br/><p>The girl led the delegation into the court gloomily.</p><br/><p>Great! They were close to the Central Academy of Drama and the Beijing Film Academy. There had been no Beijing Broadcasting Academy at the time.</p><br/><p>The students of the two academies were excited. They had originally intended to show off their beauty, as there would be no chance once the sports meeting began. Qin Guan had attracted all the attention though.</p><br/><p>The team of the Beijing Film Academy was in turmoil. The seniors of the 97 class were all busy with their graduation, and the best student from the 98 class, Pan Yuchen, was not there. Du Chun and Ling Xiaosu from the 99 class were the only ones present. They had to choose another student. Suddenly, they realized that there was no freshman from 2000 who could play a pivotal role.</p><br/><p>They were confused. We are no longer the best-looking college.</p><br/><p>They were angry with the students registered during the past three years. Any one of the graduates of the 96 class could have rivaled Qin Guan, such as Chen Kun and Huang Xiaoming.</p><br/><p>Bingo! We could send our girl! Where is Miao Pu?</p><br/><p>Students from the Central Academy of Drama were clear on their dilemma, and they had already begun tittering.</p><br/><p>Their boy, Deng Cao, was not too bad.</p><br/><p>After competing with each other both openly and secretly, the two academies finally decided the winner.</p><br/><p>During the closing ceremony of the sports meeting, Qin Guan was appraised as the most handsome flag-bearer. As he was waiting on the court, he got along well with the students from the Beijing Film Academy. They recognized him from his roles in the two famous TV shows. Although Qin Guan had only been a supporting character, it was still enough for them to accept him as a member of their group.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

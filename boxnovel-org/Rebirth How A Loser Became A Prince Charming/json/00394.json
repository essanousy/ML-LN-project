The film was aiming for an award and a regional theater chain, so the investor was only focused on the final result.</p><br/><p> Unlike the temporary crew of \"Elephant\", this film was important for Miramax Films. Actually, Qin Guan, the leading actor, was the last person to be chosen.</p><br/><p> All the scenes were set in Manhattan in the 1980s, so Qin Guan wouldn't need to fly to another city. Everything was ready.</p><br/><p> \"He pieced together a part of the jigsaw of his life...\"</p><br/><p> That was people's appraisal of him.</p><br/><p> Sitting in the makeup room. Qin Guan waited silently for the final touch-up. His black hair had been dyed brown and curled into a traditional 80s hairstyle.</p><br/><p> In his yellow shirt and checkered overalls, he looked like he lived in a time when gentlemen used pipes and walking sticks.</p><br/><p> When Qin Guan went out to meet the director and the crew, everyone let out a breath of relief.</p><br/><p> A little vintage, a little yuppie and a little absurd. That was the story of that old Jewish family.</p><br/><p> The phonograph was singing in a hoarse voice on the yellowing wooden floor.</p><br/><p> \"Great. It's our first day together. Let\u2019s try a simple scene. You don't even need to show your face, Qin Guan. I only need your bottom.\"</p><br/><p> Director George winked at Qin Guan. Everyone around them burst into laughter.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan began to take off his clothes fearlessly. It was an indie film! Of course he would need to get naked again before the camera.</p><br/><p> Nudity, both men\u2019s and women\u2019s, was the soul of indie films. Since this was a comedy, he could express himself freely.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took off his underwear and touched his curly hair. He looked like he had a chicken coop on his head.</p><br/><p> The scene was set in a plain dark room in a small hotel. On the ceiling was an incandescent light bulb. The mattress and the bedding on the single bed were in a mess.</p><br/><p> The black-and-white TV was on. Qin Guan stood barefoot on the dirty floor, lost in thought.</p><br/><p> The job of the cameraman was quite simple. It was the easiest scene in the entire film. The camera was rolling. \"Three, two, action!\"</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Qin Guan changed. A second ago, he had been a charming prince. Now, he looked like a guy with many secrets. Nobody could rescue him.</p><br/><p> He just stood there, one leg bent and the other straight. He was a real punk out on the street. Nobody was in the mood to appreciate his smooth back, tight bottom and slender legs though, although they were like god\u2019s gift to humanity.</p><br/><p> They all smiled knowingly. His back view reminded them of their funniest friend.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's facial features were in the dark. Only his eyes were visible in the camera.</p><br/><p> His transparent pupils were telling of his decadence, struggle, conflict and hesitation. He was trying to find a proper excuse for his silence and failure.</p><br/><p> The Asian boy did not just have the ideal face for an indie film. He was also a very intelligent actor.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan\u2019s first on-screen partner appeared. It was the glamorous Drew Barrymore. The actress was wearing a vintage 1980s outfit, and her full lips were bright red.</p><br/><p> She looked withered and helpless though. Behind the door of the shabby hotel, she was looking at her ex-boyfriend through a crack on the door.</p><br/><p> \"Can we talk? It might have been my fault for forcing you to marry me...\"</p><br/><p> \"Darling, I can't go on without you...\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was a coward, so he dared not have a face-to-face conversation with her. He could only hide in the small room. They both remained silent on their respective sides of the door. His eyes were black and hers were blue.</p><br/><p> Nothing was visible on the camera but their two pairs of beautiful eyes.</p><br/><p> \"Good! Stop!\"</p><br/><p> \"The first scene is perfect. I was afraid that Qin Guan might act like a statue....\"</p><br/><p> Everyone laughed good-naturedly. Drew left through the door with her assistant. The actor in the room was naked anyway.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan noticed a commotion by the entrance.</p><br/><p> \"What are you doing here, my beautiful lady? We are working... Ah!\"</p><br/><p> The crew failed to stop the angry woman from bursting in.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan turned his head around just in time to see a red bag hit him straight on the forehead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

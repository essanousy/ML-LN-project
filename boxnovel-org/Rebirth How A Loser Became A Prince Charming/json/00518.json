Qin Guan actually knew the man, although the man didn't know him.</p><br/><p>It was Nick Carter, a member of the Backstreet Boys. According to \"The Sun\", he was passionately in love with Hilton.</p><br/><p>Considering the current situation though, the man needed a confirmation.</p><br/><p>\"What are you looking at? Have you never seen a handsome guy before? Listen to me, Paris is just obsessed with you temporarily.\"</p><br/><p>Nick was as alert as a porcupine lifting its thorns.</p><br/><p>\"Are you challenging me, bastard?\" Nick couldn\u2019t stand Qin Guan's expression. He walked over and stood in front of him. He was 1.85 meters tall with short blond hair. The big boy didn\u2019t want to lose face before his enemy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shrugged with a smile. Then he pressed Nick's blond hair down, letting it go and watching it bounce back up.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s so elastic!\"</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cker!\" Before Nick could hit the Asian man on the face, a woman spoke from behind them.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\" It was Paris Hilton in a pink dress. She was about to rush up to Qin Guan, as if there was no one else present. Cong Nianwei pulled Qin Guan away though and hugged Hilton herself.</p><br/><p>\"Calm down. All problems can be solved through a negotiation. Understand?\" Holding Hilton's hand, she pulled her away.</p><br/><p>\"Let's have a private talk.\"</p><br/><p>Before her voice could fade away, they disappeared in the crowd. Nick had no time to fight with the annoying Asian guy. He went after them, leaving Qu and Qin Guan behind. The two of them exchanged a helpless look.</p><br/><p>\"Why is Hilton doing all this?\"</p><br/><p>\"God knows...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was surprised that Cong Nianwei wanted to negotiate with Hilton. As he headed for the buffet, he felt a little pleased with himself. His girlfriend seemed jealous. Being handsome is a sin.</p><br/><p>He had no idea how Cong Nianwei was dealing with Hilton. She was telling her that Qin Guan was her boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei led Hilton to a corner of the garden. The Asian girl was not as weak as she looked.</p><br/><p>\"You must be really brave to dare hug a man before his girlfriend! Didn\u2019t your parents teach you about honesty and honor?\"</p><br/><p>Hilton was massaging her hurting hand with a grimace. \"You are just old-fashioned. Hugging is a form of greeting. Besides, handsome guys belong to everybody. They are no one\u2019s property...\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she paused. The girl, who was the same age as her, smiled at her softly.</p><br/><p>\"We are childhood sweethearts. We have been together ever since we were babies.\"</p><br/><p>With that smile on her face, Cong Nianwei seemed gentle. \"I am the woman who understands him the most. I\u2019m not with him for his looks, but his soul. We love each other.\"</p><br/><p>At her words, Hilton realized that the lovers harbored different emotions, emotions unique among her acquaintances.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she felt admiration and envy. Lowering her voice, she said, \"But he is really handsome\u2026 Better than all the boyfriends I have ever had.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei smiled and shot a meaningful look at her. \"If you accept my proposal, you can observe his studies and daily life for a month. That way, you will get to see another part of him. You will be regretful. Deal?\"</p><br/><p>\"Deal! Why not?\" Hilton agreed before setting her own terms. \"Listen...\"</p><br/><p>The two girls, who had completely different personalities and complexions, whispered together.</p><br/><p>While Qin Guan was enjoying the buffet, Cong Nianwei and Hilton returned to the living room hand in hand, looking like good friends. Qin Guan had no idea what had happened, but he felt much better now.</p><br/><p>Nick also returned from outside. He stood next to Hilton, pretending to be calm.</p><br/><p>There were people performing on the stage. Some stars tried to perform during the break to highlight their presence. Hilton was interested in nothing but Qin Guan though. She looked at him again and again without moving.</p><br/><p>Nick thought for a moment and gave her a cantankerous smile. Then he patted Hilton's shoulder and walked to the stage, blowing her kisses.</p><br/><p>Some beautiful girls had just stopped dancing. Taking advantage of this, the musicians hastened to drink some iced beer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

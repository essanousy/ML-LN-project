Director Xu now realized why Jiang Wen had recommended him for the part.</p><br/><p>The man's polished acting skills were like uncut jade. He was the best choice for portraying noblemen and scholars now that occidental and oriental culture had clashed in China.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wen was a skilled, refined actor, but he wouldn't have been able to achieve that subtle effect. The role was not his cup of tea, but it fit Qin Guan perfectly.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the Austrian author had given Qin Guan his entire soul and essence. After nearly one century, his classic work had finally found a genuine hero.</p><br/><p>The moving camera pulled Xu back from her thoughts. Qin Guan got off his motorcycle elegantly, his long windcoat flying in the air, and waved at the girls in apology for the intrusion. His wide smile shocked the girls, who felt the first awakening of love in their hearts.</p><br/><p>They fell silent, although this was not in the script. All eight girls looked at his retreating back, black coat and black boots.</p><br/><p>An old steward welcomed Qin Guan in, the two of them disappearing from the camera's view together.</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\" Li Pingping, who was the photography director, pulled everyone back to reality. She had been hired by Xu and transported from Taiwan especially for the film. Xu had explained why to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Li understood films set during the era of the Republic of China really well. She was also a Taiwanese award-winning photographer, so she was certainly worth her salary.</p><br/><p> Now was her time to shine. A good photographer had to check everything for the director. The first scene ended without any mistakes, making the crew feel strange. They had gotten used to repeated takes when working with domestic actors.</p><br/><p>The next scene did not go as smoothly though. Qin Guan and the girl, Lin Yuan, met in private for the first time. This was their first meeting and the beginning of the girl's misery, as she fell in love with a man who never paused for any woman.</p><br/><p>The girl, who was a student at the time, rushed out of the yard and bumped into Qin Guan, who was about to enter through the gate.</p><br/><p>The two of them hugged each other in shock. The gentleman lifted his hands politely when he saw that it was a lovely girl. A true playboy was never rude to a strange girl.</p><br/><p>The girl looked up nervously. \"It's Qin Guan, it's Qin Guan...\" Lin Yuan repeated in her mind, unable to break the spell.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of this, Li Pingping zoomed in on her face. Meanwhile, Xu was encouraging the girl silently, afraid that she would be affected by Qin Guan's beauty.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the trembling girl turned pale. Everyone knew that this was a common rookie mistake. She was just too nervous.</p><br/><p>When she looked up, she got lost in Qin Guan's eyes. Qin Guan turned his back to the camera so no one could see his face. When he realized the state Lin Yuan was in, he decided to take the lead.</p><br/><p>He smiled warmly at her, his eyes shining as splendidly as the mysterious starry sky as he fixed them on her boldly.</p><br/><p>Lin lowered her head again in delighted shyness before she leaned to the side and ran away. Her shyness was like the clear, fragile morning dew on flower petals.</p><br/><p>It felt so wonderful! As the song \"Whisper of Pipa\" played in the background, the audience got lost in the scene.</p><br/><p>The sad tune sounded like a woman sorrowfully telling her tragic story.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Meanwhile, the erotic photos and all relative news were still spreading online.</p><br/><p>It was quite a blight for the Chinese youth, who would now think that it was easy to become famous by taking off their clothes. This was a really bad notion to promote.</p><br/><p>Thus, a prohibition was issued in an urgent and strict manner. The SARFT sent a warning to all the involved stars, who seemed like they would stay away from the media for quite some time.</p><br/><p>It was quite an influential event, not only for the entertainment circle, but also for ordinary people, as it made people refresh their awareness and indicated that the moral degeneration of the world was getting worse each day.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was counting the days at home before an open calendar.</p><br/><p>When shall I take the third step for my wedding ceremony? Suddenly, his eyes fixed on a date.</p><br/><p>He had nearly forgotten about that day. Would the wheels of history stop? All the events of his previous life had become reality one after the other during this life. Just like a butterfly, he couldn't change anything, except the fate of his and Cong Nianwei's families.</p><br/><p>That day, which was a scar on the heart of every Chinese person, would inevitably come. Tomorrow would be May 12th, the day of that terrible earthquake, which had been the most serious earthquake after the one in Tangshan. An unprecedented disaster was on its way.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Qin Guan could do more than he had done in his previous life.</p><br/><p>What should he do, though? Should he call the Seismological Bureau? They would think that he was crazy. All he could do was donate money to help the disaster area.</p><br/><p>When the disaster came at the appointed time, the Chinese government used its emergency mechanism immediately. The police, the fire brigade, the army, the local government and some volunteer organizations headed to the area.</p><br/><p>The Chinese were a race that had endured pain for thousands of years, so an indomitable, revolutionary spirit was deeply rooted in their blood.</p><br/><p>\"Are you ready?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>The staff of Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei's companies had gotten organized to help the disaster area. Men followed Qin Guan to the site, while scrupulous girls stayed on the home front. Supplies were on their way, and the truck team was formidable.</p><br/><p>They were among the first group of volunteers to reach Sichuan and bring food, clean drinking water, medicine and clothes. He was not only the first guy from the entertainment circle, but also the first entrepreneur to get there. Before everyone could come back to their senses, Qin Guan had already arrived in Sichuan.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, another special group was headed to China. They were overseas Chinese immigrants, including Han Zhujiu, Xu Xiaoxiao and their team. As veterans, Han and his men were capable of searching for survivors, while Xu took advantage of his status in Chinatown to spread the news among every patriot.</p><br/><p>He Ming also took action. He encouraged the Chinese businessmen in his club to make donations. Even though they were far from their motherland, they were still descendants of the Yellow Emperor.</p><br/><p>As the country faced this crisis, all her children stood up for her. If enough candles united, they could light the whole territory up. Qin Guan's website also helped the cause.</p><br/><p>\"We are here. Come join us!\"</p><br/><p>\"Help Wenchuan!\"</p><br/><p>His truck team aside, Qin Guan also deposited 10 million in the account of the Red Cross. He was a man of actions, not words, so he did his best to ease the pain of the people living in the disaster area.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If this was in OMG, American indoorsmen and hackers would have come out boldly.</p><br/><p>Still, losers had come out resolutely.</p><br/><p>\"A yellow-skinned monkey of little value. What award did he get?\"</p><br/><p>\"A man making a living on his appearance. This must be an advertisement for his firm. That vulgar newly rich generation...\"</p><br/><p>Jealous people were everywhere. They were not just in China.</p><br/><p>Such bitter comments made Vivian angry. Before she could roll her sleeves up, those strange posts suddenly started disappearing.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck!\" a wretched man shouted at his black screen. If he was right, his computer must have burned down. It was deep at night. A group of computers were burned all over the US. In a messy dormitory at Columbia, Rongzhi clicked his mouse in an elegant manner.</p><br/><p>\"Fixed it!\" I\u2019ll destroy all the computers whose owners insulted my prince!</p><br/><p>The aggressors set off an alarm bell for Vivian. Qin Guan\u2019s fan club was already established online. After careful voting and interviews, they selected a new name: \"Mainstay\".</p><br/><p>The name was of majestic power, balance and honesty. It sounded much better than \"South Korean fad\". Those years, the South Korean fad had just sprouted, while Qin Guan had his own fan club in the US and Asia.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about what had happened online, although it would influence his career in the future. After getting a good night\u2019s sleep, he flew to Switzerland to join the Tiffany staff.</p><br/><p>That was something very convenient about his work. Top models would fly everywhere. Their short-term work would give them more choices when they were accepting offers.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei stood by Qin Guan happily with a North Face travelling bag. She was going to be his assistant this time. It was the first time they would be travelling abroad ever since they had come to America. Besides, their destination was Switzerland, a country famous for its watches, chocolate and candy. Cong Nianwei could already taste their bitter sweetness.</p><br/><p>The journey was sweet and warm. Their hands were locked until they arrived at the hotel.</p><br/><p>Basel was a beautiful European city. It was the fourth biggest city in Switzerland. While it had a population of only 18,000, it was much smaller than a Chinese town. It was bordering with France on the Northwest and with Germany on the Northeast. Its special location was typical for Switzerland.</p><br/><p>The Rhine River went across the city, giving it an element of romance and art. On the left bank was the old Basel, the financial center of Switzerland. On the right bank was the new Basel, the most beloved city in the country.</p><br/><p>There were art studios, craft workshops, handmade cheese shops with a long history and coffee bars as old as Cong Nianwei\u2019s grandma. The old European buildings reminded people of a time when Swiss girls danced in white aprons.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei walked along the streets hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\"We can stay here for a few days after I finish work...\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>The next day, Cong Nianwei helped Qin Guan get ready in the Tiffany meeting room. He was in the latest Armani Haute Couture, a privilege that exclusive models enjoyed. They could wear the latest Haute Couture for free when appearing at other non-formal wear shows.</p><br/><p> This might have seemed generous, but it was actually an advertisement amid the fashion circle. Qin Guan was fond of that rule though. Most of his money went to formal outfits for publicity events. So many people would be jealous of such a chance.</p><br/><p>Michael was the leader of the Tiffany team. As a high-ranking manager of Tiffany, he was also responsible for the fair.</p><br/><p>He sized Qin Guan's outfit up in appreciation. It was a conservative royal blue suit that would go very well with all the jewellery.</p><br/><p>His buttons were fastened and his tie was perfect. His assistant also brought a bow tie of the same color as an alternative option.</p><br/><p>He is a professional model worthy of Armani.</p><br/><p>Tiffany didn\u2019t focus on appearance though. As the global economy declined, all the top jewellery brands were suffering from stress. Tiffany concentrated on the commercial value of models.</p><br/><p>Several business cars arrived at the Baselworld fair early in the morning. Everyone was shocked by the site.</p><br/><p>There were five halls in total. Baselworld had originally started from watches, so in Hall No. 1 to Hall No. 4 the stages were reserved for top watches. Hall No. 5 was the costliest one in the fair.</p><br/><p>Top brand jewellery from all over the world was assembled in that hall. After the press conferences, there would be auctions and purchases every day, which was the highlight of the fair.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

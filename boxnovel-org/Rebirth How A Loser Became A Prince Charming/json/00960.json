However, there was no Best Supporting Actor Award at the Venice Film Festival, so the judges had reached the conclusion that Qin Guan would be considered the main character of the film.</p><br/><p>When the final moment came, even Qin Guan listened to the host's words nervously. If an actor had two films selected for the final round, but still missed the opportunity to win, it would be a big embarrassment for them.</p><br/><p>People were looking at Qin Guan enviously. They believed that he had to be the winner. Otherwise, the host would not have clarified that. Brad Pitt, who was sitting nearby, looked offended.</p><br/><p>His career was flying and he had married Angelina Jolie and gotten rid of his ex-wife's influence. Thanks to his rising value, the American actor had become one of the best actors in Hollywood.</p><br/><p>His film \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" was on the final list of nominees. It was an outstanding film way out of Qin Guan's league that told a story about cowboys. If Qin Guan had been cast, he would only have been able to play a Chinese labor worker.</p><br/><p>Pitt still held a grudge because of his fight with Qin Guan in the lounge. Although he was a brave, unrestrained man, he always felt uneasy around the Chinese man.</p><br/><p>Actually, everyone had misunderstood the host's words. The first person to find out the winner's name would be the special guest that would open the envelope.</p><br/><p>The special guest announced the winner calmly.</p><br/><p>\"The winner of the Best Actor Award is Qin Guan with his film 'Lust, Caution'. Thanks to his fine depiction of the character and unique acting style, he has presented us with an outstanding historical Asian film! Let's applaud for our winner, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>The audience did as it was told.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up and walked to the stage. In the short distance that he had to cross, people stood up to greet him as he passed, showing their respect for the award winner.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took the statue of the lion with the spread wings and bowed.</p><br/><p>\"I would like to thank the judges. I finally achieved a grand slam. Of course, this is not my award for not being single anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone who was in the know smiled and nodded. Yes, the young man had already achieved his goal.</p><br/><p>The award had come just in time to be a gift for his wedding ceremony.</p><br/><p>\"Now, I have a new dream. I will keep working until I achieve another grand slam. My new goal is to win awards at the five biggest international film festivals...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his speech quickly and surrendered the floor to the host. Then, the crucial moment came. Ang Lee and Jiang Wen parted immediately, straightened their clothes and sat up properly.</p><br/><p>\"The winner of the Golden Lion is 'Lust, Caution'!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was sitting between the two men, felt ice on his left and flames on his right. Both directors remained calm, but Qin Guan could feel the difference in temperature between them.</p><br/><p>This was already Ang Lee's second Golden Lion. No director could be more grateful. Each award was a milestone in his career that indicated his value and professionalism. </p><br/><p>What made a director famous? Awards, of course!</p><br/><p>That was why Chinese directors went for unpopular indie films. To win awards! Even if one won just one international award, they wouldn't need to accumulate any experience in the circle anymore. They would become famous overnight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

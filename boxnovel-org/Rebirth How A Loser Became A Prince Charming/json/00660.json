The police representatives, who had come from different directions, could form a splendid parade.</p><br/><p>There were policemen on horseback from Texas, who looked as sturdy as bikers, patrols from the Mexico border, and city detectives from Chicago. Compared to them, the small town sergeants were like flowers in a greenhouse. They had experienced unbelievably brutal cases. </p><br/><p>Getting a chance to enjoy themselves was rare for them. Before the New Year, they had been sent to another city on the government's expense. They had fallen into a sea of joy and put all gratitude and resentment aside.</p><br/><p>As the host, Sergeant Henry was both suffering and having fun. It was a happy day for him until his arch enemy showed up.</p><br/><p>\"Hi, dude. Long time no see. You are still a boring New Yorker, I see. I wonder what the party will be like...\"</p><br/><p>It was Sergeant Tommy from Los Angeles, who called himself a fashionable sergeant.</p><br/><p>\"Ha! It will be better than your party last year, which was full of studs and beauties!\" Son of a b*tch! Henry was not about to show any weakness in his home court.</p><br/><p>\"But you have to admit that everyone likes that. Come on, everybody! Tell me that you love me!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone burst into laughter at their quarrel. Those tough guys didn't care about the performance taking place on the stage. They had just gotten together to relax. As high-risk employees, they needed some entertainment during the holidays.</p><br/><p>When almost everyone had arrived, Henry took a look at his watch. Qin Guan must be ready!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the sound of cheerful, deafening gongs and drums came from the square behind the police station.</p><br/><p>The guests squeezed before the gate together as they heard the passionate music. Some of them pushed the gate open. Everyone was stupefied. The square was like a sea of joy.</p><br/><p>There were traditional Chinese lion and dragon dancing teams on the square, as well as a group of martial artists.</p><br/><p>A red ball made of silk strips was thrown up into the sky. The actors wearing the lion heads jumped up after the ball. Two lions caught the ball in their mouths and landed on the ground, fighting over it.</p><br/><p>Loud cheers encouraged them. \"Well done!\"</p><br/><p>The lions winked naughtily at the audience. Shocked by the scene, the inexperienced police officers winked back in confusion.</p><br/><p>The two lions started rolling around on the ground with the ball, making way for everyone else. Their murderous looks overwhelmed the audience.</p><br/><p>\"Flags up!\"</p><br/><p>The deafening roar scared the policemen. Some nervous ones instinctively reached for their guns. What are those Asians doing? Do they want to kill us all with one stone? There have been no cases against Asians lately. What are they doing? </p><br/><p>As they looked around in horror, countless flags were lifted above the crowd. They were traditional colorful silk banners with small triangle edges and embroidered logos.</p><br/><p>The name of each martial arts club was written in block letters on the flags. There were also English translations below.</p><br/><p>\"Longxing Hall!\"</p><br/><p>\"Juying Hall!\"</p><br/><p>\"Xinxi Hall!\"</p><br/><p>They seemed to be there for a large assembly. All they needed was a stage.</p><br/><p>Carrying their flags, they walked to the building like a sports parade.</p><br/><p>\"Longxing Hall is here at Master Qin's invitation!\"</p><br/><p>The flagpole was poked into the ground as the senior master held his fists up to salute the American policemen.</p><br/><p>Several officers copied his gesture, hesitantly returning the salutation. Before they could think about it, the next group was up.</p><br/><p>\"Juying Hall, Tengfei Club and Xinxi Hall are here at Master Qin's invitation!\"</p><br/><p>They seemed very powerful and vigorous. By contrast, the officers looked weak both in body and spirit. Tommy craned his neck around Henry and asked the local king in a low voice, \"Who is Master Qin?\"</p><br/><p>Master Qin was annoyed. He had told them to come to the hall. They had done as he had said. They were on time, but their way was a little different...</p><br/><p>Master Qin squeezed to the entrance awkwardly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

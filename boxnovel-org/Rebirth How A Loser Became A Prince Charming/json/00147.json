You dare bully Jiajia! You brute! I shouldn't have trusted you! I\u2019ll beat you to death!\"</p><br/><p>She was a master of the stick. Qin Guan ran around the room covering his head. He tried to explain, \"You misunderstood! Things are not like they seem\u2026 Huang Jiajia, help me explain!\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia sniffled and pouted, turning her head away proudly. Her mother grew even more agitated. I did not misunderstand!</p><br/><p>The stick hit Qin Guan over and over like raindrops. Actually, I hurt her feelings. There\u2019s nothing to explain. I\u2019d better run away.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan escaped from Huang Jiajia's home with bumps all over his head. Huang Jiajia is really her mother\u2019s daughter. Both of them are great at fighting.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia\u2019s mother pushed Qin Guan out of the door, comforting her crying daughter, \"Darling, stop crying. I\u2019ll break his legs if he dares come to our house again. How dare he bully my daughter!\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia wiped her tears away. \"Mum, my score is not high enough for his college.\"</p><br/><p>\"Forget it, you\u2019ll apply to other colleges.\"</p><br/><p>\"No! I want to be in the same college with him. I like Teacher Qin.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia\u2019s mother was confused. This has to be a story of a shameless teacher molesting an innocent girl. Surely, there was nothing meaningful between them.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia began to cry. \"He doesn't like me! I won\u2019t see him again if I\u2019m not in the same college as him! You just drove him away! I didn't have intercourse with him! It's all your fault!\"</p><br/><p>It was a typical case of a villain fooling his victims. Huang Jiajia's mother was the one who loved her the most. She would do anything for her daughter.</p><br/><p>Patting her on the chest, she promised Huang Jiajia, \"You just try your best during the next month. So long as you pass your exams, I will help you.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia stopped crying and smiled. \"Really? You\u2019re telling the truth?\"</p><br/><p>Her mother nodded. \"Don't worry, I\u2019ll take care of it for you.\" Huang Jiajia felt relieved. She applied herself to her courses happily.</p><br/><p>Her mother's idea was simple. She planned on complaining to Huang Jiajia\u2019s father until he found a solution.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his dormitory with a broken heart. Huang Jiajia's mother hadn\u2019t paid him for their last lessons. Forget it. It can be considered punishment for breaking her heart.</p><br/><p>Before his sorrow could fade away, he received a call from New Silk Road. Sister Xue was waiting for him at their headquarters.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn\u2019t realize the importance of the meeting until he entered the meeting room and saw Ni Dalei and the director of the Market Department waiting for him.</p><br/><p>At the director's request, Ni Dalei read the statistics of his models\u2019 orders in nearly half a year. He had a serious expression on his face as he did.</p><br/><p>Everyone was losing customers. Qin Guan was the worst one among them. He was actually at number zero.</p><br/><p>This was common for models after a couple of months, but it was strange that Qin Guan would face such a problem at the beginning. Other models of Ni's had also been influenced. Ni had been aware of the situation and reported it back to the headquarters.</p><br/><p>Several days ago, they had come to the terrible conclusion that the Pioneer Fashion Model Company had declared war against them.</p><br/><p>They had bribed a phone receptionist who happened to be in charge of Ni's business calls.</p><br/><p>It was shameless commercial espionage, and it was not suppressing just a single person, but the profits of the whole company.</p><br/><p>New Silk Road had found out from the receptionist that the famous model Shao Xiaobing had been taking jobs from them. It had come as a surprise, but the director had to do something about the company\u2019s future development.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and his agent had been invited there to discuss suspending their affiliated contract. The director couldn't shut his eyes to the lost customers, not if the reason was an affiliated model.</p><br/><p>There were two choices for Qin Guan. One was to sign a formal contract with New Silk Road and Sister Xue, and the other was to be relieved from the contract and go back to being an independent model again.</p><br/><p>Looking at the preoccupied Sister Xue, the director told her, \"I feel for you, but this is the best solution according to the director of the modelling school.\"</p><br/><p>Professor Li's friend was also involved. Sister Xue frowned deeper. If they signed the formal contract, Qin Guan wouldn\u2019t be able to have control over his own time, and the division rate would be 7:3. Only renowned models could get a rate of 5:5. This was beyond Qin Guan's reach.</p><br/><p>Neither she nor Qin Guan would be satisfied with such a contract. There was only one choice left. They had to work by themselves.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue took a long breath. She was ready to give her final answer, when suddenly Ni\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, this is New Silk Road. Yes, yes. Which model? Qin Guan? Hold on, please.\"</p><br/><p>The director was sitting opposite Sister Xue and Qin Guan. He had a well-thought-out plan and he was just waiting for their decision. In his opinion, anyone in their right mind would choose to sign a formal contract with New Silk Road.</p><br/><p>If it was not for the J clothing advertisement, which had a good sales volume and was well-known in the advertisement circle, he wouldn\u2019t have been trying to sign a contract with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He was a rising star though, and the director wanted to secure him for a new annual stage performance before he was discovered by another company</p><br/><p>His idea was pretty good, yet the two people sitting opposite him were not reliable. One of them wouldn\u2019t take a job as his carrier, and the other was quite confident about Qin Guan. They both replied in one voice, \"We\u2019d like to cancel the contract.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The two of them burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha...\"</p><br/><p>Giorgio Armani was smiling in a corner with his hands behind his back. \"Draw up Qin Guan's contract in advance! It seems that we will have to fight over him with other brands during the next year...\" he told his assistant before leaving.</p><br/><p>He shot a meaningful look at Channel. That shameless woman was fond of undermining others.</p><br/><p>The old man with the moustache from Hermes teased the unhappy Gucci director.</p><br/><p>\"I hear that Qin Guan is not interested in your collection. Thank you so much for giving me this chance. Believe me, sheepskin can also be sold at high prices. Did you know that we are breeding crocodiles in Africa? Nowadays, only an idiot would stay in the eye of the storm. Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>The Gucci director hummed loudly at his old opponent. Our show is tomorrow. You'll see the passion of our customers. Only silly people are fooled by your sheepskin.</p><br/><p>The incident ended without any trouble. Some capable internet users had taken photos of the crazy man. A photo in which Qin Guan was stamping on his face was uploaded on OMG and shared online fast.</p><br/><p>\"He is also a martial artist!\"</p><br/><p>\"Does he save others or just himself?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei laughed happily as she read the posts. Her boyfriend was always a source of entertainment, even when he was away.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the winner of that unexpected spectacle. People had seen his value during that incident. As night fell, the PR departments of different brands tried to contact his team. The early bird caught the worm after all.</p><br/><p>His team received numerous ambassador contracts, professional offers, designer invitations and advertisement deals. As his exclusive designer, Yin Changtao was now under the spotlight. Both he and his designs were waiting for the test of the Milan fashion circle.</p><br/><p>Even though Qin Guan was the reason for all this, he still had to stick to his schedule.</p><br/><p>\"You have a lot of work tomorrow. I suggest you get some sleep now.\"</p><br/><p>His assistant closed the door without hesitation. Two security guards temporarily assigned by the organizing committee were standing outside his room.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt as if he was under witness protection. The accident was an embarrassment for the organising committee, so they were very grateful for Qin Guan's brave actions.</p><br/><p>Despite the beautiful night, Qin Guan had to abandon his plan of enjoying some delicious food outside. He surrendered to his fate and fell asleep as soon as he went to bed.</p><br/><p>After the Armani Haute Couture show, he was invited as a special guest to the Gucci press conference. He was wearing a mysterious Chinese outfit again. The fitting design looked very fashionable on him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was bored to death during the fur show. When someone took the seat beside him though, he held his yawns back. It was Giorgio Armani himself.</p><br/><p>\"Hi, sir. I see you have come here personally.\"</p><br/><p>The old man smoothed down his grey hair calmly.</p><br/><p>\"My old friend invited me. He wanted to hear my opinion on the collection. This is Gucci's most gorgeous and most expensive collection after all. He wants to show off his high-end concept to me and laugh at the principles of the last generation.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt awkward. The designers of the last generation were competing against each other.</p><br/><p>What Giorgio said next astonished him though.</p><br/><p>\"I'm also here for our exclusive model...\"</p><br/><p>Wow! I am so grateful for this honor...</p><br/><p>\"2003 has come to an end. I can't have you stolen from me during the new year...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

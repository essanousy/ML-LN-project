It\u2019s not all about money. I think a two-year contract will help Citizen, as well as increase Qin Guan's popularity.\"</p><br/><p> \"There are too many requirements. Qin Guan will have to stay in Asia the whole year. That schedule is impossible.\"</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Sister Xue switched the conversation to another subject. \"I know Citizen will be entering the market in North America. I heard that a branch office in the US has already been established. We could transfer Qin Guan's contract to the US branch.\"</p><br/><p> Qingmu couldn't help but smile at Sister Xue's proposal. He looked a little proud as he answered, \"Impossible.\"</p><br/><p> Before Sister Xue could refute him, he explained to her, \"Occidental taste is different from oriental beauty appreciation. We already picked a top American model last year. Although Qin Guan is outstanding, we have invested a lot in the US and we dare not bet on a nameless Asian model.\"</p><br/><p> \"Our representative in North America, Chad, used to be a leading player in a baseball team. As you know, baseball is very popular in the US. He was discovered by a talent agent as soon as he retired.\"</p><br/><p> \"Qin Guan is on the same level as him. Chad is also a new favorite of VOGUE. The main edition.\"</p><br/><p> Qingmu paused there. What he meant, but didn\u2019t say was, \"Young man, a model from VOGUE Asia is inferior compared to one from VOGUE US.\"</p><br/><p> Self-awareness was a virtue.</p><br/><p> \"He broke VOGUE\u2019s routine. His pictures occupy 40 pages in this season\u2019s edition. It was a shock for the whole fashion circle! If you had a business, which one would you choose?\"</p><br/><p> It was rather hard for Sister Xue to swallow. She looked deeply shocked.</p><br/><p> \"Here is a magazine for your reference.\"</p><br/><p> Sister Xue took it and flipped through it. Chad was a handsome guy with a broad chest. He was exactly the kind of man ladies in western countries liked.</p><br/><p> Is this the top model standard in the rest of the world? It's quite different from how top models look in Asia.</p><br/><p> Beauty had an extremely large scope. Even Asian people, who preferred slender models, would have liked Chad.</p><br/><p> Sister Xue picked up an edition of VOGUE ASIA. A mysterious, fascinating vibe seemed to be more attractive to Asian readers.</p><br/><p> The two magazines were before Qingmu.</p><br/><p> \"You\u2019re saying that Qin Guan is inferior compared to Chad? Be honest!\"</p><br/><p> Qingmu changed the topic to avoid an argument on something so trivial. \"A representative with popularity is the key to the US market. That's the best way to proceed. If we can get a share of the market in a couple of months, why would we spend more time on it? We are a branding business, not an agency. It's not our duty to discover and promote talent. Sorry!\"</p><br/><p> The discussion came to a dead end. After some more rubbish, the two parties fell silent.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was not influenced by the outcome of the conversation though. Before leaving, he kindly bid Citizen's staff goodbye. Everyone except Zhuchuanlongfu. The old man and the young man hugged each other disappointedly.</p><br/><p> Thank you for supporting me. You were on my side during the entire meeting.</p><br/><p> Zhuchuan felt sad for the cowardice of his company. They had lost the Japanese courage with which they had initially established their company.</p><br/><p> The younger generation will come to regret this negotiation. For my sake, I hope Qin Guan can give Citizen another chance in the future.</p><br/><p> Sister Xue and Qin Guan went out of the meeting room. Sister Xue was angry, but Qin Guan was smiling. Kyoko Fukada\u2019s agent, who was waiting outside, was taken aback.</p><br/><p> He was surprised to see Qin Guan having a negotiation with Citizen before Kyoko Fukada. He was even more surprised to find out that Qin Guan had failed to sign a contract.</p><br/><p> That's why I saw Takashi Sorimachi and Jincheng Wu in the lounge. They were preparing for the negotiation. Citizen had thought of a plan B in advance.</p><br/><p> When Qin Guan left, silence prevailed in the empty meeting room.</p><br/><p> During the first half of the year, Citizen's sales volume in Asia had risen again after a two-year downturn period. The sales of men's mechanical wristwatches had equalled the total sales of both 1999 and 2000. It had been the most striking news for Citizen.</p><br/><p> Qingmu broke the awkward silence by saying regretfully, \"What a pity! If Qin Guan had signed a contract for Asia, our annual sales volume may have reached the top of Japan thanks to the two stars\u2019 help. We might even have made the top-ranking list of the whole world.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes, you\u2019re right.\"</p><br/><p> There was no doubt about it. All the attendants nodded in approval, deeply regretting Qin Guan's choice.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan felt relieved though. He calmly tried to comfort Sister Xue.</p><br/><p> \"I think this is better for me.\"</p><br/><p> \"How is it f*cking better? You were looked down upon. Considering your status, no brand in Asia should dare overlook your influence.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

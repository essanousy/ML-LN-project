Caught off guard, the rider fell off its back. Fortunately, his boots were out of the stirrups, so he didn\u2019t end up hanging from the horse.</p><br/><p> Unfortunately, the animal\u2019s horseshoes kicked the man in the teeth. A tooth flew high in the sty.</p><br/><p> \"Careful!\" Qin Guan shouted loudly, warning the rest of the crowd. The horses ran in different directions on Fifth Avenue.</p><br/><p> The black horse locked its eyes on the strong man and headed for the crowd.</p><br/><p> The angry horse was getting closer and closer. There was nothing else on Qin Guan's mind. Nobody wanted to be a hero anymore. All directions were blocked by frightened people.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan cast a glance at Cong Nianwei. Then he made a decision. He threw his cap and glasses at her. \"Stop running about! Hold the fence and squat down!\"</p><br/><p> His shout served as a warning for the confused crowd. Qin Guan was right. The fence would block the horse. Even if it jumped over the fence, it would run into a dead end.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei caught Qin Guan's belongings. Her face was pale as she looked at her boyfriend calmly.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stomped on the fence and leapt high towards the running horse. The horse fell on its back. Before it could come back to its senses, Qin Guan stepped on the stirrups and tightened the reins.</p><br/><p> Using his other hand, he patted the horse gently on the belly.</p><br/><p> It's alright, honey. Everything\u2019s alright. Let's go home.</p><br/><p> His legs clamped around the horse\u2019s belly, and he used his mouth to hold the reins. After a few seconds, the black horse gradually stopped moving.</p><br/><p> The people in front of Qin Guan were quiet and calm, unlike the unruly crowd behind him.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan didn't feel the difference. He wiped the sweat off his forehead.</p><br/><p> \"Good boy, good boy.\" He patted the horse\u2019s back and turned his head to Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p> A golden ray of sunshine fell on his face. His tall nose made him look like a Roman sculpture. Smiling gently at his girlfriend, Qin Guan stood up before the crowd.</p><br/><p> \"Wow!\"</p><br/><p> \"Good boy!\"</p><br/><p> \"Such a handsome boy!\"</p><br/><p> \"Hush...\"</p><br/><p> Screams and whistles fell and rose around them.</p><br/><p> \"Have a bottle of beer, young man. My treat!\" An old man threw a bottle of beer at Qin Guan. A black bra followed. It had been thrown by a pretty girl.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan glanced at her red lips and then peered at Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p> He picked the black lace bra up with his fingertips, as if it was a hot potato, and handed it to Cong Nianwei. He noticed that it was an F-Cup.</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s Triumph. I wonder if flea shops accept fancy underwear.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was disappointed. Cong Nianwei only wore a B+-Cup. I\u2019m doomed.</p><br/><p> He cast a guilty glance at Cong Nianwei, who signaled for him to get down from the horse.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan jumped down obediently and walked up to her.</p><br/><p> He was prepared for a slap on the face, but surprisingly, Cong Nianwei hugged him tightly. Even cold iron bars couldn't separate their hearts.</p><br/><p> \"Are you an idiot? We should have run away. How come you were so confident with that horse? Let\u2019s squat down at least. There are policemen who are able to control them.\"</p><br/><p> Indeed, the chaos had been settled by the police and security staff. The horses were silently taken away.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei was about to say something again to cover up the horror of losing Qin Guan, but she collapsed in his embrace instead.</p><br/><p> The best elements of the US were perfectly embodied in the two Asian lovers: world peace, romance and fierce conflict.</p><br/><p> Everyone applauded them, making them blush deeply</p><br/><p> They escaped as quickly as they could.</p><br/><p> \"Hey! Wait!\" Someone pulled at Qin Guan's loose T-shirt from behind. Luckily, they had reached a corner far from the noisy parade.</p><br/><p> It was a fashionable guy, one of the weird people who walked the New York streets. He handed Qin Guan his business card politely. The words \"Starlight Media\" were printed on it. The pink feather on the man\u2019s head was trembling nervously.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

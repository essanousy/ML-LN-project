However, just before he left the site, Qin Guan noticed Jude Law's annoyance. All actors, famous or not, wanted to win awards. Even older actors yearned for that honor.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's team accompanied him to his hotel as Wang was about to publish the news.</p><br/><p>It was already midnight in America, but it was noon in Beijing. Sister Xue called Qin Guan on his computer. She was still nervous, even though she had watched the entire ceremony.</p><br/><p>Both of Qin Guan's official websites published the news at the same time. Sister Xue always accompanied Qin Guan to such grand events, so she wanted to talk to him as soon as the ceremony ended.</p><br/><p>She was just in time, as Qin Guan wanted to talk to her too.</p><br/><p>Video communication technology had been developed by then, and some international large-scale enterprises had started using it during their meetings to work simultaneously from different locations.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan appeared on the screen with the golden award, holding it up for Sister Xue to see. His words made her tear up.</p><br/><p>\"I have already won many awards with my firm, but this one was just in time. You have stayed with me during many ups and downs, until I finally grew up and learned how to make it through any storm alone. If I hadn't, you would never have thought about marriage. Now that you don't have to worry about money though, you can think about your own affairs. This award is a great acknowledgement for both of us. It's also a milestone for our new start.\"</p><br/><p>\"You don't need to worry about me. Just get ready for your wedding. I'll attend it when I return to China. If I'm lucky enough, I could win another award in the meantime.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue smiled tearfully and pointed to the screen, as if she was trying to poke at his forehead. \"Stop showing off. According to my estimation, you will not be winning an Oscar. Considering you are Chinese, you were lucky enough to be nominated. All the judges would have to go mad simultaneously for you to win an Oscar.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't feel sad. At least he had won one award. He was still young. He didn't need to rush.</p><br/><p>He turned off the video and entered the bathroom. He had to save strength and energy for the next day.</p><br/><p>His team had no time to waste. Wang Liying was busy with the press and other important work.</p><br/><p> In America, things were much simpler. Qin Guan's official blog, the mainstream media and the PR team of the film company took care of the promotion, so all Qin Guan had to do was inform the crew before he updated his blog.</p><br/><p>Things were more complicated back at home though. Very few reporters had travelled to America on their own expenses. Only the newest media, which had a big enough budget, had sent reporters there.</p><br/><p>Besides, there was also another Chinese film at the Oscars, director Zhang Yimou's \"House of Flying Daggers\".</p><br/><p>This was the director's second Golden Globe nomination. Unfortunately, he suffered an unprecedented failure in America.</p><br/><p>His incomprehensible story, confusing scenes, weak characters and hasty promotion couldn't hold a candle to \"Heroes\". The distributing company suffered a loss, so after two weeks, the film disappeared from cinemas all over the country.</p><br/><p>Its gross was only a few million dollars, just like the indie film \"Elephant\".</p><br/><p>Even though that film was Zhang's Waterloo, it could still participate in the Oscars. All the domestic media concentrated on the Chinese film instead of on Qin Guan, as the domestic film circle was not very familiar with him.</p><br/><p>The reporters panicked when they found out that Zhang's film hadn't won a Golden Globe. It was up to them whether to use those news as a headline or not. Suddenly, they realized they had an alternative choice.</p><br/><p>Wang's cabinet was filled with people as she selflessly shared the news with everyone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

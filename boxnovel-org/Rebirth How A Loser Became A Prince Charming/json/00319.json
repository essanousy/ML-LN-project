They are not romantic at all. We should keep a distance from them, Batiste!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" The plumper boy, who was the younger brother, blinked. \"But, Batisler\u2026 What if they say hello to us?\"</p><br/><p>\"Silly boy! You can just start speaking French. They do not seem clever. They speak poor English, so they shouldn\u2019t be able to speak French well either.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh!\" The fat boy named Batiste nodded.</p><br/><p>Joseph was still standing by the door. He was always serious, even when he was gossiping about his neighbours. \"According to international research, you French guys are idiots. You are only better than Africans. You dare laugh at the cleverest race in Asia? You\u2019re ridiculous!\"</p><br/><p>\"You!\" Before the French brothers could explode, Coulibaly from Congo got angry. \"That\u2019s bare discrimination! I\u2019m the best delegate studying in the US. As the son of a tribe chief, I would like to give you an official warning.\"</p><br/><p>The man could hide perfectly in the dark if he didn\u2019t open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Putting on his poker face, Joseph said, \"There were four grammar mistakes in your words. Don\u2019t tell me this is a standard London accent, because it isn\u2019t.\"</p><br/><p>\"According to official research, only a small group of Irish in South London can speak with an original standard English accent. Don't ask me how I know that. I have no time to explain to you idiots!\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Joseph shut the door in time when he saw that the African was about to throw his gold bracelet at his head.</p><br/><p>The Batiste brothers started laughing loudly, ignoring the reality of the situation. Joseph\u2019s laughter echoed in the empty hallway.</p><br/><p>\"Shut the f*ck up!\"</p><br/><p>Several girls with brown skin opened the door of the largest apartment. They were the only female lodgers on that floor. All the onlookers closed their doors silently.</p><br/><p>Their leader, a Mexican girl, was dressed like a hippie. There were rings on her nose, lips and bellybutton.</p><br/><p>A shining skull was on her chest and a dangerous-looking poppy was on her leg. Her hair was styled in a bright red Mohawk.</p><br/><p>\"Who woke me up? It must be that f*cking German! He is like a mouse in a stinking ditch!\"</p><br/><p>Cella licked her lips impatiently. Her underground band had two gigs that day. She had no time to go back to sleep.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll kick his head like a ball one day.</p><br/><p>Cella and the other girls retreated to their apartment. They had to get dressed and go out into the wonderful Manhattan night.</p><br/><p>Coulibaly, the brave prince of the Congo tribe, shivered. He still recalled the day when he had returned late at night and scared Cella in the hallway. He had also been scared by her.</p><br/><p>Cella had seen a mouthful of white teeth floating in the air, while Coulibaly had thought that she was a demon from a legend.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were carrying their shopping bags back to their apartment. It seemed like they would have to buy a small car.</p><br/><p>According to their contract, they could get a parking space at the lot across the street for free. Of course, that was included in the rent. It was convenient, although the rent there was higher.</p><br/><p>By the time night fell, they had put away everything. Warm yellow lights were turned on silently in the small kitchen. There was beef boiling on the stove.</p><br/><p>Dinner would be ready in 10 minutes. The reflection of the moon was visible on the floor of the living room. Qin Guan was wearing an apron, while Cong Nianwei was cleaning the long second-hand table they had bought.</p><br/><p>This was a good residential community that could meet all their living standards.</p><br/><p>The smell of beef rose from the pot. When they seasoned it with Chinese spices, the American beef would taste delicious. Cong Nianwei arranged the tableware, while Qin Guan filled a large bowl with soup and beef.</p><br/><p>\"Isn\u2019t that too much?\" Cong Nianwei asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\"We can put it in the fridge later and save it for when we are feeling too lazy to cook.\"</p><br/><p>The two of them smiled at each other. Suddenly, they heard someone knocking on the door.</p><br/><p>Who is it? Who would drop by at dinner time? Is it that shameless John? Qin Guan answered the door and saw a stranger outside.</p><br/><p>\"Hello! I\u2019m Joseph. I live in the apartment across the hallway. I noticed that I have some new neighbours. This is a welcoming present for you.\"</p><br/><p>Bro, try to find a better excuse next time, okay? I saw you at the door with your bread when my girlfriend went out with that pan. Be more sincere in the future. Why did you come here with just one loaf of bread?</p><br/><p>Keeping open doors was a traditional virtue of the Chinese though. Qin Guan smiled at him and invited him in, \"Welcome. Come in, please.\"</p><br/><p>Actually, Joseph wanted to bum a meal off them. He had been born in a country with terrible food, second only to British food. He usually had no interest in food, but the smell of meat in the hallway had attracted him to the new neighbours\u2019 apartment. What a shame! I can\u2019t tolerate having dry bread and beans from a can when I\u2019m smelling that wonderful smell!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

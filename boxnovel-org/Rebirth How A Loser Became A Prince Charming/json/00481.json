Is this an unconscious choice of L\u2019Oreal, or a way of the industry? Why didn't they inform me in advance?</p><br/><p>Their resources were limited, so it was profitable to kick someone out. </p><br/><p>No! No model would be capable of setting up such a trap. Only a large agency, or several agencies together could have done this. If we fell into the trap, we could have done nothing but blame ourselves.</p><br/><p>The photographer in charge of the fashion stills told them to get into position.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Shall we begin?\" Baal waved at Qin Guan, her long, blonde hair hanging down to her waist.</p><br/><p>After getting the concept of the advertisement, Qin Guan smiled at the photographer. \"Let's begin!\"</p><br/><p>The white background was as pure as snow. A female model in a long red V-neck dress was standing there, the hemline of her dress spreading on the stage like a blooming poppy.</p><br/><p>Qu buried her face into her hands. I can't bear to watch. Everyone else also seemed to think that Qin Guan looked wrong in that scene. Qin Guan wasn\u2019t thinking of anything though. Work was work. One had to advance, regardless of the difficulties they faced.</p><br/><p>Of course, if there was bullsh*t in front of me, I\u2019d avoid it...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked calmly to the center of the scene and arranged the white couch. Then he sat down, folding his legs.</p><br/><p>He took out the real protagonist of the advertisement carefully. It was a slender lipstick, different from traditional thick lipsticks.</p><br/><p>He moved the lipstick in his slender fingers to reveal its red color. It was as bright as the rising sun. Qin Guan waved at the nervous female model.</p><br/><p>The girl felt calm at the sight of his eyes. He is a good model. We will take a splendid photo together.</p><br/><p>The blonde beauty lowered her head at Qin Guan's request. Her full chest was visible on the camera.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly changed. He seized her jaw and began to apply lipstick on her lips. His eyes were filled with ardour. He was dedicated to the job. Even the funny wig was a symbol of his talent.</p><br/><p>The fashion was him. He was the fashion.</p><br/><p>The staff in the dressing room went out one after the other to take a look. The most sensitive of them fell into deep thought tearfully. Makeup artists are so beautiful. Our rebellious style is nothing to laugh about.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not aware of the advantages his performance had brought him. All the makeup artists in America would try their best to work for him in the future.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was focused on the female model. When he was finished, he touched his own fingers to his lips.</p><br/><p>Everyone went crazy as the cameras recorded the scene. Tyra and Jay were completely absorbed in his performance.</p><br/><p>Banks had originally been opposed to inviting Qin Guan to the show, as he was only a rising greenhand in the US. She was convinced by his performance now though and appreciated the decision made by her seniors.</p><br/><p>This season will get good audience ratings!</p><br/><p>Qu had not moved in a long time. She didn't come back to her senses until Qin Guan had finished most of his work. Then she walked slowly to a corner and took a seat.</p><br/><p>She was sweating heavily. Sometimes, caring affected one\u2019s feelings. She was thinking hard about the reasons behind this. Before she could reach a conclusion, the photographer was done.</p><br/><p>Qu walked over to watch the playback.</p><br/><p>It was an advertisement for a cosmetics set, which included a lipstick, foundation, eyeshadow and eyebrow pencil. He was the first male model to promote makeup for women. The photos would shock the fashion circle.</p><br/><p>While everyone was busy selecting the most beautiful photos, the models were changing costumes in the fitting room. Qin Guan was treated like a king. The makeup artists wanted to massage him and feed him candy. The team leader told them to get back to work. Otherwise, they might have forgotten about their next task.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went out in another normal outfit. Everyone was concentrated on his face though.</p><br/><p>His skin seemed smoother and more delicate than before. No flaws or pores could be seen under the lights. His eyebrows, cheekbones and jaw all looked polished. He looked even more handsome than before!</p><br/><p>Those shameless makeup artists!</p><br/><p>The director had no time to pay attention to the model's face. He was too focused on the script. He was eager to see if the model could act it out well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

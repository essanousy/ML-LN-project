Find the best server! Ha ha! The Haijiao Forum finally has its day!\"</p><br/><p>He was so happy, he was almost out of his mind.</p><br/><p>At midnight, the threshold of the next day, all news about Qin Guan's affair on large web portals suddenly disappeared. Then an official announcement came out. Countless fans hailed before their TVs.</p><br/><p>They were really powerful. They had caused that storm and made someone hear their voices.</p><br/><p>That day had to be commemorated. It was a victory of thousands of nobodies on the internet. That incident made Qin Guan famous among young people. They all focused on him without saying anything.</p><br/><p>October 25th was a good day. On the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Windows XP was launched, which was much better for office and home use.</p><br/><p>That day was also an important day for Citizen. At the Chenxi Plaza in Wangfujing, the site of the Citizen launch event, the mysterious veil was lifted.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was excited about the luxurious setting. Citizen is so generous! They had set up a giant T stage especially for Qin Guan, its exit decorated with a big Citizen dial plate.</p><br/><p>The hands moved and the diamonds on the plate shone one by one. In the dim light, the whole setting looked splendid.</p><br/><p>On the centre of the T stage, there was a big hourglass. A golden bowknot was tied around its middle.</p><br/><p>Inside the hourglass were hundreds of magnificent watches made of shiny metal.</p><br/><p>What luxury!</p><br/><p>The invited media and distributors slowly entered the hall.</p><br/><p>When the last guest was inside, the staff in charge of security closed the entrance with a red rope.</p><br/><p>The media gathered under the stage, talking in low, curious voices. A small group of people were hiding in a corner.</p><br/><p>The reporter who was Qin Guan's fan had been promoted to assistant reporter of the entertainment section. He cast a disdainful glance at his downhearted peers. Ha! Do you know the outcome of offending my prince now? Behave yourselves and don't bring shame to the internet media again!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was backstage, had no idea what was going on. He just closed his eyes and felt refreshed. The assistant nodded to the program director and the background music began playing.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went out in advance, following the rhythm of the music.</p><br/><p>He walked slowly from the dial plate in a charcoal business suit. He looked like an ageless fairy. The audience suddenly fell silent.</p><br/><p>The host said in a low, deep voice, \"Citizen men\u2019s watches focus on mature, confident expression instead of trying to please the public\u2019s eye.\"</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan had reached the centre of the stage. He loosened his cuffs and rolled up his sleeves. A silver mechanical watch was presented to the media and the distributors.</p><br/><p>The informed audience expressed its contempt for the shameless brand.</p><br/><p>You said that you don\u2019t try to please the public, yet you hired a model to please it. Even a five-yuan plastic watch would look like a Swatch on that model.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised his wrist naturally, showing the watch to the audience.</p><br/><p>The host continued his narration, \"Its independent, elegant style compliments Asian gentlemen. Its round plate and tough metal chains are quite different from traditional Japanese patterns. They reflect a natural, refined European style.\"</p><br/><p>As they studied the details of the watch, the audience noticed Citizen's transformation. The brand had changed a lot, not only in the men's collection, but also in the women's. Even those watches were hi-tech.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Citizen was not satisfied with its domineering position in the Asian market. Judging by those changes, the brand was planning to explore a way to the European and American market.</p><br/><p>The media held on to their discovery. Citizen would probably become a favorite in Europe and the US one day.</p><br/><p>Flashlights twinkled everywhere. Qin Guan took off his suit jacket and set it on the edge of the stage, arousing a fierce applause.</p><br/><p>He rolled up his other sleeve to reveal the Citizen mark printed on his wrist. His acting skills were so professional that the head of the conference kept nodding at him.</p><br/><p>The audience screamed again and again. Qin Guan had nothing to say about the moral integrity of the so-called media.</p><br/><p>By the time he returned to the hourglass, his suit jacket had disappeared from the stage.</p><br/><p>Some crazy fan must have picked it up on the sly.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could do anything, the female ambassador, Kyoko Fukada, came out from backstage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to wait for her by the hourglass with his most graceful smile.</p><br/><p>More and more flashlights started flashing. The music changed, and the audience gradually calmed down.</p><br/><p>Zhuchuanlongfu got on the stage through an elevator. He made a short speech and began promoting the new watches.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

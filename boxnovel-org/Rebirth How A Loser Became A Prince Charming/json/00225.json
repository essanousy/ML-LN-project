We were invited by Ms. Xue to meet Mr. Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>The gatekeeper answered, \"Okay, one second.\"</p><br/><p>They heard the sound of the bolt, and then the gate was opened. A gatekeeper in a two-piece set made of blue satin was standing there with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"Are you Mr. Zhuchuan? Mr. Qin has been waiting for you for a long time. Follow me, please.\" Zhuchuan\u2019s attention was attracted by the lively stone lions. It was said that in ancient China, only high-rank feudal officers and noble families could put lions at their gates. The Chi dragon on the roof beams also enchanted him. His ancestors were definitely among the intelligentsia!</p><br/><p>He focused again as the gatekeeper invited them in. They kept taking deep breaths as they entered. There was a grand yard 100-meters long, covered by the shadows of trees. There were two paths with red wooden pillars and a roof.</p><br/><p>The gatekeeper pointed to the right. \"Follow me, please.\"</p><br/><p>They walked along the corridor on the right, flowers blooming on both their sides. The ground of the yard was paved with old giant green stones.</p><br/><p>They turned into a small hall after a minute. The gatekeeper didn't follow them in. He brushed his sleeves lightly and bowed before them. \"I\u2019m on duty. Please wait for a while. The steward is coming.\" Then he left silently.</p><br/><p>They were confused. What do you mean? You won\u2019t lead us to Qin Guan? You\u2019re only a gatekeeper? How awful!</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan was immediately attracted by the arrangement inside the hall. A scroll of calligraphy was hanging on the wall. It was the name of the hall, \"Breeze Pavilion\".</p><br/><p>Gasping in admiration, he sat in a chair across from it, ready to appreciate the work. By then, another person had entered through the side door of the hall.</p><br/><p>The man was dressed in the same blue satin clothes, but with more complicated embroidery. He had an ever-smiling expression. \"Sorry I\u2019m late. I\u2019m the steward. Mr. Qin has been waiting for you for quite a long time. We were originally going to serve you tea, but Mr. Qin doesn\u2019t want a bigger delay. He would like to meet you now.\"</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan nodded. He was extremely curious. If the reception hall was that extraordinary, then what would the living room be like?</p><br/><p>They followed the steward along the pebbled path, through the flowery courtyard, to the deepest part of the yard.</p><br/><p>The red-lacquer gate was opened, revealing a secret garden from another time. Traditional red lanterns were hanging above them. A towering glass house reminded them that this was not really an ancient yard.</p><br/><p>A tall pomegranate tree was enveloped by the colorful glass house. The steward pushed the door open gently.</p><br/><p>The sunshine fell through the leaves of the trees, leaving flecks on the benches under them. In the middle of the room, on a dragon-carved rosewood bench, a young man was reading an ancient thread-bound book.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a black silk gown that did not look old-fashioned. The silver embroidery on the corners made it gorgeous.</p><br/><p>There was a traditional rosewood table beside him. A purple teapot and a bowl were on it. Nothing else.</p><br/><p>Steam was hovering around him, making the young man look like an immortal.</p><br/><p>The visitors felt seduced by the charming autumn, the beautiful yard and the outstanding young man.</p><br/><p>They were lost in thought, when someone suddenly coughed behind them. \"My dear guests, why don\u2019t you enter? You should remind our distinguished guests, steward.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue presented herself proudly. Ha ha! You are all rubbish compared to my boy!</p><br/><p>Following Sister Xue, the visitors entered the dreamlike greenhouse. They felt like they were in heaven as they approached Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Smiling, Qin Guan put his book down and stood up. He stretched his jade-like hands towards them, gesturing for them to take a seat.</p><br/><p>They sat on old chairs, polished by age. They were surprised to find them comfortable.</p><br/><p>With their typical structure, the chairs invited people to lean against their back. That was what Zhuchuan did. He leaned his back against the chair, surprising his assistant.</p><br/><p>Our boss never relaxes before an audience! He must have done it by accident.</p><br/><p>The steward retreated from the greenhouse. Not long after, several middle-aged ladies put a tea set on each table beside the chairs.</p><br/><p>As the steam rose up, the guests could see the color of their tea. It was golden, like amber. There was the natural fragrance of orchid in the air.</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan held his cup up and took an appreciative sip.</p><br/><p>\"Clouds and mist always come from clear rivers and high mountains. The monks at temples plant tea trees, which swallow the air on the hills, bathe in sunshine and moonlight, and get the essence of the morning and evening glow...\" Qin Guan was reading ancient poems.</p><br/><p>In the innermost corner of the greenhouse, a maid was playing a Chinese zither. The Chrysanthemum blossoms were waiting to burst open, and the incense sticks were burning.</p><br/><p>They all watched Qin Guan. It seemed like time was flowing back in that greenhouse. They were watching a young man living in a yard and making a cup of tea on an ordinary morning.</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan showed his cup to Qin Guan, who smiled gently and said, \"Tieguanyin [1], from Anxi Town.\"</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] Tieguanyin was one of the top 10 traditional teas in China. It was found between 1723 and 1735 in Anxi Town in the Fujian Province.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

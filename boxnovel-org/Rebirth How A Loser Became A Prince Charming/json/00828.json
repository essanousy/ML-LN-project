They had finished their performance first, so many actors were waiting for their turn. They had nothing to do anytime soon, so they could do anything they liked.</p><br/><p>The smart figurants took this chance to walk around. They took out everything they could find- marker pens, lipsticks, T-shirts, bags, etc- and asked for autographs. Their eyes were filled with hope.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I'm a fan of yours. Could you please sign here for me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Harlem Yu, I'm such a big fan...\"</p><br/><p>They walked up to them in turns so they wouldn't block the other actors' way to the stage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt tender as he watched the scene. He put his arms around Yu and Xie's shoulders. \"Don't you have anything else to do? This is our first meeting, so we have to get to know each other. It'll be really helpful for our cooperation.\"</p><br/><p>Tse and Yu nodded helplessly. \"It's no big deal. The fans are really nice. We could turn this into a signing session.\"</p><br/><p>The two men were members of the entertainment circle, so they were really smart. They knew that Qin Guan was delaying them to help the fans.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed to their lounge. \"We have to remove our makeup first. Then we'll be in that room. If you want an autograph, send a representative with all the things you want signed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Thank you so much!\"</p><br/><p>The men chatted happily in the room as a representative of the fans collected items from the crowd. The fans felt really happy that their idols were so close to them.</p><br/><p>When the girl knocked on the door with all the items, she almost burst into tears.</p><br/><p>She liked Qin Guan for his looks, acting skills and pure love, so she took one more look at her idol.</p><br/><p>The three men in the lounge got to work. This simple job was of great significance for their fans.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan picked up the last piece of paper, the girl said in a low voice, biting on her lips, \"Could you please write one more sentence?\"</p><br/><p>\"What would you like?\"</p><br/><p>\"To the rising stars of the Central Nationalities Song and Dance Troupe: Zhong Lingyan and Zhong Yanling.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's addressed to two individuals?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, we are twins. My sister likes Nicolas Tse and I like you.\"</p><br/><p>Before her voice could fade away, another small head appeared around the door. The two girls looked identical, but their different costumes implied that they performed different dances.</p><br/><p>Their two identical faces confused everyone.</p><br/><p>Zhong Yanling pointed to herself. \"I'm the oldest one. I like Qin Guan.\" Then she pointed to the other girl. \"This is my sister. She likes Nicolas Tse.\"</p><br/><p>Yu sighed. It's so wonderful to be young. If they were triplets, maybe one of them would have liked me. Before he could start feeling sorry for himself, the second girl took another piece of paper out of her pocket.</p><br/><p>\"I, I also like Qin Guan. I wanted to ask him for an autograph personally.\"</p><br/><p>Her older sister looked really surprised. \"Why didn't you tell me before? Actually, I have already included your name.\"</p><br/><p>The shy girl looked really cute. \"Sorry, but you were so fond of him... I didn't want to compete against you...\"</p><br/><p>Yu burst into laughter as he signed with trembling hands. Tse nearly got angry. My friends in Hong Kong have always said that Qin Guan was poisonous. It seems like it's true.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan signed once more for them. The two girls flew away with all the items under Tse's terrifying gaze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

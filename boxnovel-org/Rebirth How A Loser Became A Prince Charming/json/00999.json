It was a simple, yet joyful wedding celebration. Long-lost smiles emerged on people's face. Children were fighting over candy as adults were smoking \"Red Happiness\" cigarettes provided by Qin Guan's staff.</p><br/><p>Locally distilled liquor filled mugs, lunch boxes, bowls and cups. Their selected wedding outfits were waiting silently in their house in Beijing. That day, only the silk flowers on their chests indicated that they were a bride and a groom.</p><br/><p>When night fell, spring insects started singing nature's very serenade in the bushes. Filled with hope for their new life, the couple headed to the newly-built temporary houses.</p><br/><p>\"We could choose the one I built personally.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was eager to do this. They had never had such an experience before. Cong Nianwei had no reason to stop him. She nodded shyly and received a big smile in reply. </p><br/><p>Every minute of their wedding night was precious. The next morning, Qin Guan got up late. He brushed his teeth outside, smiling at each person that happened to pass by.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me. Is Comrade Qin Guan here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Who are you?\"</p><br/><p>\"I was sent by the Olympic Organizing Committee. I need him to confirm something.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait a minute! Xiao Wang! There is a man looking for your boss!\"</p><br/><p>\"Great! I've finally found you! We have been trying to contact your studio for a long time. The principal said that it would be difficult to get in touch with you, but they gave me general directions so I could come here personally. If it wasn't for the group wedding, I wouldn't have found you so fast.\"</p><br/><p>\"I thought that Qin Guan's work for the Olympics was over.\"</p><br/><p>\"The directing team of the opening ceremony has invited Qin Guan to participate in the event. Director Zhang Yimou recommended him, and the government approved his proposal. He is expected to return to Beijing as soon as possible for the first rehearsal.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait a minute!\"</p><br/><p>Although it was hard to turn down such an assignment, Qin Guan was hesitant.</p><br/><p>\"I still have work to do here. Plus, my wife is here as well. We just got married. We're newlyweds! I can't leave her alone. It will be dangerous here during the next few days. I'm worried about her safety.\"</p><br/><p>A member of his staff walked over with an old phone. Its strong signal was the only method of contacting the outside world.</p><br/><p>\"Hi, Qin Guan. This is Zhang Yimou.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Director Zhang. Here is what the situation is like...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan explained the situation quickly. Zhang was just as straightforward.</p><br/><p>\"I know how you feel, Qin Guan. Many people from the entertainment circle are headed to the disaster area. In my opinion, China needs a lot of power to pull through. The Olympics will be a centripetal force for all Chinese people. We'll show China's beauty everywhere around the world. This way, we'll attract global attention. This is just as significant as your work there. Although we are working in different fields, we are still working for the same nation. I'll be waiting for you in Beijing.\"</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan hung up, he saw several people, including Cong Nianwei, gathered around him. They were all looking at him with the same expression in their eyes. Qin Guan could feel their heartfelt wish.</p><br/><p>Go! We wish the 2008 Olympics our best! Cheers! Show the entire world our strength!</p><br/><p>The expectations of the people living in the disaster area forced Qin Guan to return to Beijing. On the plane on his way there, Qin Guan sat alone with tears in his eyes. He would never show anyone how sensitive he was.</p><br/><p>By the time he arrived at the rehearsal site, everyone was busy working. No one paid any attention to him. He was just a shining star in a galaxy of stars.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? You're here!\"</p><br/><p>Someone finally noticed me. </p><br/><p>\"F*ck! What happened to you? You seem so...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

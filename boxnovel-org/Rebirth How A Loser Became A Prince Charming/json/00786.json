This meant that a large firm would take charge of his films and TV series in the future, although the original rights were still in his hands.</p><br/><p>The news surprised anyone who intended to fish in troubled waters. The next day, the news about Qin Guan overwhelmed the readers.</p><br/><p>\"With an investment of 10 million, Qin Guan became Huayi's savior.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan's shooting rights will temporarily belong to Huayi.\"</p><br/><p>\"What will the directors think about Qin Guan choosing a side?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yin Li speaks highly of his acting skills after cooperating with Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>Ordinary readers only paid attention to Qin Guan's large investment, while clever insiders saw the meaning behind the words and approved of the young man's good insight.</p><br/><p>Director Zheng, who was trying to find Qin Guan's faults, thought highly of his vigorous and resolute decision.</p><br/><p>\"His political consciousness has become higher after that revolutionary film. He made the right decision this time. Why is everyone making such a fuss about the firm? Can't they spend their limited energy on their work? Those idlers only pay attention to things that do not concern them. They should go watch movies at the cinema instead of downloading films illegally.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was like a small boat between two storms that wouldn't sink, despite the terrible weather. When everything calmed down, people realized that it was not a small boat after all, but a large cruise ship able to withstand strong waves.</p><br/><p>Some stars came back to their senses and called Qin Guan to complain. A few Hong Kong stars like Wu Junru heard about Qin Guan's choice after signing the contract and called him to complain and fix their strained relationship. As traitors, their only choice was siding with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The contracts of the Hong Kongers and the Taiwanese were much looser than those of the mainland actors. Qin Guan answered their calls politely. If they were loyal actors, all he could do was send them his blessings.</p><br/><p>The most regretful one among them was Chen Hao. The girl, who had maintained a good relationship with Qin Guan after their cooperation, had signed a contract with Tiancheng before receiving Qin Guan's call and fell into deep despair after his announcement.</p><br/><p>Unable to stand the competitive pressure at Huayi, she had hoped to become the top actress of the new firm. All the good actresses had stayed at Huayi except her, so she would be considered the best at the new company. However, the powerful male actors made her afraid that the developmental direction of the company would be diverted. If that happened, the so-called top actress would find herself in a dilemma. As for her future development...</p><br/><p>Chen Hao let out a sigh of worry. She was feeling deep regret for her greed.</p><br/><p>When the storm passed, the forgetful public was attracted by other news and Qin Guan could finally sigh in relief. On a sunny spring day, he attended the wedding of his agent and collaborator.</p><br/><p>It was a simple, yet romantic wedding ceremony of Western style. The sun shone down on the lawn, the white silk arch, the priest and the stage.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue held hands with Yin Changtao, who was a Chinese immigrant. The couple had met in a foreign land and then fallen in love in China.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had invited only her closest and dearest to the beautiful ceremony, including Professor Li, Teacher Rong, Qin Guan, Cong Nianwei and some other good friends. Everyone wished the new couple the best...</p><br/><p>As they exchanged rings on the stage, a guy sitting behind Qin Guan suddenly cried out loudly, \"Ah! My love! Why are you marrying that pig? He is bald! I am so miserable! She rejected me, a talented young man, for an international affair! My heart is broken!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They were worth about 100,000 dollars. Will the casino go bankrupt?</p><br/><p>He grew nervous, and so did the crowd, who wanted to see the world in chaos. They were all excited to watch a duel between two talented men. This was even more fun than an erotic dance!</p><br/><p>People gathered around the table as Qin Guan shot a secret look at the dealer. Cards flashed before his pupils.</p><br/><p>J, 9, 4, 6, 6, K...</p><br/><p>J, 9, 4, 6, 6, K\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Shall we continue, sir?\" the new dealer asked Qin Guan with a smile. Before he could reply, a familiar voice was heard from the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"There you are, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw Cong Nianwei walk over to him. He had no time to pretend. He just stood up to welcome her.</p><br/><p>\"Did you get my message?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait a minute, I have to gather my money. We'll have a big dinner tonight. My treat!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around to put all the chips in his box. Just as he was about to follow Cong Nianwei out, the dealer came back to his senses. He nearly fainted in reaction to Qin Guan's behavior.</p><br/><p>\"Are you leaving, sir?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was focused on his girlfriend, answered him impatiently, \"I have both a good eyesight and good memory. The next cards would be J, Q, 10, 8. You wouldn't ask for more cards. I'd give up and lose 5 dollars to you or an even bigger amount, as the next card would be 3. No, thank you. I'd rather go. You are welcome!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a sigh of resignation and ran away with his chips. The dealer was standing stupefied behind the table as the Asian caller tried his best to suppress his laughter.</p><br/><p>The caller gently picked a fifth card out and shuffled the cards again. Qin Guan was an international award-winning actor after all. He had good reason to run away, as the fifth card was a 6, not a 3, which was an unfavorable card for him.</p><br/><p>The audience had no idea about that though. The strong man took Qin Guan's lucky seat proudly.</p><br/><p>A Chinese fortune teller would make a big fortune in Las Vegas. Gamblers were the most superstitious people in the world.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>The manager, who had witnessed everything through the monitor, sat back, lost deep in thought. His white Arabic head scarf slid down his shoulders.</p><br/><p>The Asian lovers got out of the casino with a roll of bills. When she saw the proud smile on Qin Guan's face, Cong Nianwei realized that he must have played some kind of trick. A winner was better than a loser though, so she decided to let it go for the sake of the money.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan headed to the Blue Man Show Theater early the next day. He was in a very good mood as the stylist led him to a professional dressing room. The assistants had spread a plastic film on the floor.</p><br/><p>\"Please take off your clothes, sir.\"</p><br/><p>\"All of them?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, you can keep your underwear on.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a sigh of relief as he undressed. There was a heater in the room, so he didn't feel cold.</p><br/><p>A painter began to paint colorful patterns on his body, using a mixture of wild olive oil and golden powder. Soon, Qin Guan's skin was a glittering golden color. Only his face still looked normal.</p><br/><p>His color was even brighter than the 18 brass figures of the Chinese Martial Artists in the Shaolin Temple.</p><br/><p>His hair was colored white. When everything was finished, he looked like a mythical god. The costume provided by the prop team confirmed his theory.</p><br/><p>The loose costume was more like a sheet. The crew wrapped him in it, leaving one of his shoulders and legs exposed. Then Qin Guan put on a pair of Greek-style shoes with laces.</p><br/><p>As he stood before the mirror, Qin Guan wondered what kind of magic show he would take part in. When he saw Chris' costume, he felt grateful for his sheet.</p><br/><p>Chris looked like a zombie after dinner. He had a big bloody mouth and sharp fangs. Qin Guan, who was an experienced insider of the fashion circle, stood before Chris calmly as the man moved around him, gasping in admiration.</p><br/><p>\"What shall I do next? Should we go through the performance in advance?\"</p><br/><p>Chris took his eyes off Qin Guan's body and clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, that reminds me! We haven't had a rehearsal! Come with me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan followed the unreliable man through the red curtain that led to the stage. There was a chair in the center of the stage. The chair was welded to a steel bar, which was connected to a base on the floor.</p><br/><p>The chair looked like an umbrella. It was floating in the air, a thin steel prop holding it above the floor.</p><br/><p>\"Prop team!\"</p><br/><p>At Chris' order, his assistant took out an ascending angle bracket. Qin Guan suddenly realized what his task was.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

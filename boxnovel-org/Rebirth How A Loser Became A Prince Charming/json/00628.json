Pay attention! We are shooting a film here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha...\"</p><br/><p>Feng Wei patted him on the shoulder with a smile. \"You are a comedian in the making.\"</p><br/><p>Thank you so much!</p><br/><p>Soon, the second half of the scene began.</p><br/><p>Fan felt the back of a policewoman's waist brush against him. He looked stupefied.</p><br/><p>Policewoman: Do you feel that?</p><br/><p>Fan: Yes.</p><br/><p>Policewoman: What is it?</p><br/><p>Fan fell silent before he turned to Qin Guan for help.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got impatient with him. He poked Fan's head with his slender finger, exasperated with Fan's failure to look good. He looked like a woman grumbling in a flirtish manner.</p><br/><p>Feng was taking long breaths, trying to hold his laughter back. It's the altitude. I'm suffering from hypoxia!</p><br/><p>\"What do you feel? Tell me!\"</p><br/><p>When Fan uttered the word \"gun\", the policewoman took it out. Qin Guan was hiding in a small corner with his hands tied behind his head. He seemed to be very familiar with the procedure. He must have been arrested plenty of times in the past.</p><br/><p>He was portraying the cowardly robber well.</p><br/><p>The main actors were watching his performance from the background. Liu Dehua and Liu Ruoying were very interested in the two-time Best Actor Award winner.</p><br/><p>Wang Baoqiang was looking at Qin Guan with sparkling eyes. Qin Guan's advantages were his own shortcomings.</p><br/><p>He was the best choice for some roles, but he would never be suitable for some others. A handsome guy could portray a charming prince, but he could never be convincing as a hillbilly.</p><br/><p>\"Good! Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Feng grinned, his bare teeth betraying his good mood.</p><br/><p>Filmmakers believed that if the first scene of a film was finished smoothly, the whole film would be a success.</p><br/><p>Liu was a greenhand at acting, so his acting skills were not very elaborate. However, Liu Dehua, who was a very experienced actor, was interested in Qin Guan's performance.</p><br/><p>He knew that good, experienced actors tended to have a routine in their performances. For example, Chen Daoming portrayed all emperors in the same way, and Sun Honglei had to try to shake off all the gangster characters he had played.</p><br/><p>Liu acknowledged this problem. No matter what character he portrayed, the audience always saw him as Liu Dehua.</p><br/><p>This was a terrible thing for an actor, yet he was enlightened by Qin Guan's performance, which combined fine oriental emotions with exaggerated occidental expressions. His acting skills only served the character, not the actor himself.</p><br/><p>The award-winning actor was certainly worthy of his reputation.</p><br/><p>Liu would not be surprised if the young man returned to China and caused a storm.</p><br/><p>The whole crew watched Qin Guan go. Everyone could tell that he was special. That short scene had been enough for them to know.</p><br/><p>Lu Chuan smiled at Qin Guan when he saw him.</p><br/><p>\"We'll set out for Kekexili tomorrow!\"</p><br/><p>The Kekexili National Nature Reserve was a pearl of the Yushu Tibetan autonomous prefecture in the Qinghai Province. It was the largest and highest-altitude natural reserve in China and it had the richest wildlife in the country.</p><br/><p>One could find there beautiful Tibetan antelopes, wild yaks, Tibetan wild donkeys, as well as rare plants and the Gobi desert, all things they could not see in the city.</p><br/><p>The sky there was so blue, it was nearly transparent. Its distance from the bustling world made the location a pure land where humans and nature lived in harmony.</p><br/><p>The residents there were living in the past. They were like hermits on those snowy mountains, grassland, desert and Lama temples.</p><br/><p>Tibetan Buddhism was dominant in the area. The devotees were not that many, but they were very faithful. Sutras were being chanted everywhere.</p><br/><p>The blessed location would host a crew of more than 100 people.</p><br/><p>Humans and animals had very different lifestyles though.</p><br/><p>On their first day there, some weak crew members were affected by the altitude, which made everyone very nervous. Fortunately, the three leading actors were in good health. They left the patients at the hospital and started for the plateau. They wanted to finish their jobs as soon as possible.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If you accept it, we'll do our best to promote the film for the Oscars.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took the script dubiously. The guy had good reason to be so determined. This was the favorite film type of the Oscar committee: a superhero movie.</p><br/><p> Everyone was familiar with the hero. It was Batman himself. Of course, as a traditional Marvel character, Batman couldn't suddenly be turned into an Asian. The supporting characters could, though.</p><br/><p> Yes, Qin Guan would play Batman's arch enemy, the Joker. The distinctive, impressive character would be a real challenge for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> As the name suggested, Qin Guan would have to wear a mask for the role, so he would only be able to rely on his acting skills.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan grew even more excited as he read on. Although it was a traditional movie with a standard formula, the role was a nice one. The villain left space for the actor to show his talent.</p><br/><p> Thus, Qin Guan kept the script despite his tight schedule.</p><br/><p> \"I'll do it. Just contact my agent for details. I can't invite you in. I'm about to catch a flight.\"</p><br/><p> \"Okay, no problem. Your salary will be 18 million dollars. Is that okay for... Hey!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan ran to catch his flight.</p><br/><p> As soon as he returned to Beijing, he called the Olympic Organizing Committee.</p><br/><p> \"Yes, I can get back to work right after the Spring Festival. The sooner, the better. I'm not afraid of intense work.\"</p><br/><p> He just wanted to finish that embarrassing job as soon as possible, preferably even before the Spring Festival.</p><br/><p> When he hung up, he picked up Cong Nianwei from the construction site for a movie date.</p><br/><p> The closer they got to the cinema, the more crowded it got. The holiday was drawing near, so more and more couples had some spare time. In the winter, going to the cinema was naturally their first choice.</p><br/><p> Plus, this was the day Qin Guan's film would premiere in China, so they wanted to contribute to the film's box office.</p><br/><p> It took a long time for Qin Guan to find a place to park his car. As soon as he fixed his clothes, he got out of the car. His face was covered in a hat and a scarf, so that only his eyes were visible.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was holding Cong Nianwei's hand, just like a boyfriend in love with his girlfriend would. They had booked a lovers' seat to watch \"I Am Legend\".</p><br/><p> Milk tea, popcorn, Coca Cola and hot dogs were a must for lovers watching a movie.</p><br/><p> When the lights were turned off, Qin Guan realized that all the seats were occupied. Even the seats at the edge of the theater were full!</p><br/><p> The response of the audience satisfied Qin Guan just as much. Everyone shouted and whispered during the movie. Some girls even hugged their boyfriends during the most thrilling moments. Cong Nianwei was not one of them.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan shot a sad look at her.</p><br/><p> \"Darling, this is a really moving film. It's an indie sci-fi film that makes people think deeply about its meaning.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Director Chen held back the word \"cut\" and adjusted the camera to shoot underwater.</p><br/><p>Shooting underwater set higher standards for the actors, but Sister Xue relaxed as she watched Qin Guan through the camera. He had grown up by the seaside, so he had experienced great storms and waves. A shallow pool was nothing for him.</p><br/><p>The water was clear enough to see the bottom of the pool. Qin Guan's face seemed to sparkle like jade. His eyebrows and eyes were softened by the ripples, and his red lips looked splendid on his fair face. Anyone could get lost in them.</p><br/><p>A few bubbles came out of his mouth. One of them got stuck to his eyebrow, reluctant to part with its handsome master.</p><br/><p>\"He's so beautiful!\" Wu Junru, who was a very sensitive woman, murmured from behind the camera. A splashing sound brought her back to reality.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xue had jumped into the water in her pretty pink swimsuit from the other side of the pool. The water level was now high enough for a girl to swim in the pool.</p><br/><p>Among all famous actresses, Zhou was the most petite one. Thanks to her perfect features and inspirational looks though, she did not feel inferior to the taller actresses. Her good figure was clear under the water. She looked like an Ondine. Everyone's attention was on her as Director Chen clenched his fists.</p><br/><p>Three, two, one\u2026 Now!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan appeared before Zhou. The two of them met in the pool, their blank eyes suddenly becoming clear as they caught sight of each other. The flames in their eyes got brighter and brighter. Qin Guan put his hand on the back of Zhou's head and kissed her fiercely on the lips.</p><br/><p>Frightened by his sudden attack, Zhou resisted underwater. Her long black hair spread slowly like the most seductive, dangerous kind of seaweed. Qin Guan got lost in the sweet kiss and forgot about their surroundings. It didn't matter that they were underwater and the girl was struggling in his embrace. A kiss was enough for an aggressive man like him.</p><br/><p>His emotion got a response from the woman, who was in love with him. She gradually stopped hitting him and surrendered to his kiss, which felt as scorching as the sun. Her fair arms locked around his waist as they kissed as if there was no one else present. Qin Guan's black pyjamas were floating on the surface of the water like water lilies.</p><br/><p>After a while, they ran out of oxygen. Qin Guan, who was the one who had started the kiss, came back to his senses. His eyes opened underwater. They were not filled with desire and love anymore. They were as clear as the water. He looked at the woman silently, their lips still touching. Then he pushed her away and turned around without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xue was still in a daze as Qin Guan got out of the pool. He walked along the passage in his soaked pyjamas, leaving her behind. Zhou Xue stood in the water, watching her first love walk away. The water drops on the floor that served as proof of his presence brought her back to reality. </p><br/><p>\"Cut! Perfect!\" Chen Kexin shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>As soon as he heard his shout, Qin Guan craned his neck around the corner of the passage.</p><br/><p>\"Are we done, director? Can I return to my room? If you need me, just tell my assistant!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was pleading with his eyes. Chen waved him away. \"No problem! Go get some rest. Let's all call it a day!\"</p><br/><p>Excused, Qin Guan rushed up the stairs. His wet pyjamas weighed almost five kilos. A cold winter breeze was blowing in Shanghai. He could catch a cold the next day if he didn't take any immediate measures.</p><br/><p>There was no one along the passage, so he started taking off his clothes as he walked. As soon as he entered his room, he rushed to the bathroom. When he heard a sound at the door, he shouted, \"Get me a cup of tea, Sister Xue! Thanks a lot!\"</p><br/><p>Steam rose from the bathtub as he let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>When he walked out of the bathroom in a bath towel, he found a white cup on the table. Red ginger tea was very popular in Southern China. It was the perfect drink to have in a cold, damp night in that strange city.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

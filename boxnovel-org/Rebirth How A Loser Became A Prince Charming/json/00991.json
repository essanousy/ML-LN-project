Their heads were bent close as they tried on their rings. The two rings on their fingers were a symbol of their love.</p><br/><p>The diamond on the ring was not as one might have imagined. It was not as big as a \"dove's egg\".</p><br/><p>Their love was just like that ring. Plain, but precious.</p><br/><p>The couple looked at each other tenderly and emotionally.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the onlookers ruined the beautiful atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, can I take some pictures?\"</p><br/><p>\"Can I share the news?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked around and saw more people start to gather. Even his staff from the other building had run over.</p><br/><p>\"No problem. My website will be updated soon. You can take photos.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>This was the information era, so everyone wanted to share the striking news with others.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, I almost forgot.\" Qin Guan patted his head before he announced an important decision. \"Everyone will get paid vacation time for three days as a way to celebrate!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hurray!\"</p><br/><p>\"Long live Cong Nianwei!\"</p><br/><p>The smart employees knew that it had been difficult for their boss to say yes to the wedding. By then, she was already the master of the house, so they knew that they had to flatter her.</p><br/><p>\"Quick! Go home and get ready!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ready for what?\"</p><br/><p>\"Our wedding ceremony!\" That's why I promised you three days off.</p><br/><p>All the employees were dismissed.</p><br/><p>\"Why did our boss ask us to assemble at the Palace Museum tonight?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea...\"</p><br/><p>As soon as they released the news online, Qin Guan's website was updated.</p><br/><p>\"The first step of our wedding was the proposal. My love for you couldn't be measured with money, but I tried my best to express my love by getting you the most precious ring in the world. I love you, my wife.\"</p><br/><p>In the picture, their ring fingers were really close to each other. The audience felt warm when they saw it.</p><br/><p>\"What a beautiful ring!\"</p><br/><p>\"If my boyfriend proposed to me with it, I would accept without hesitation.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you kidding? Do you know how much this ring costs?\"</p><br/><p>\"Maybe he can afford it...\"</p><br/><p>\"You are really naive! According to my experience, this ring must be at least five carats. A two-carat diamond costs as much as a few houses in the city!\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? That's really expensive. Will the price of the ring be revealed on the website?\"</p><br/><p>\"You can leave a message and ask about it.\"</p><br/><p>Soon, there was some information in the form of an advertisement of Cartier and Tiffany. The signature of the designer and the certificate became known.</p><br/><p>It was an 19.8-carat ring! This was a heavy blow for the girls' hearts.</p><br/><p>\"It's worth dozens of millions of dollars! Stars like to show off with their small rings and the royals they marry. This is ridiculous. We can only enjoy it by looking from afar!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was suddenly attracted by the news released by Qin Guan's staff.</p><br/><p>\"Our boss has asked us to assemble at the Palace Museum tonight. He said that the second step of the wedding ceremony will take place there.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Girls were rare at MIT though, so the students were not influenced.</p><br/><p>Harvard was MIT\u2019s arch enemy. The hostility between Harvard and Yale was a kind appreciation towards each other, but Harvard was practically bullying MIT.</p><br/><p>The two world-renowned universities were located in the same small city. As the latecomer, MIT had to bear Harvard\u2019s behavior passively. MIT was near Charles River. In order to reach Boston, its students had to cross a bridge. Because of Harvard\u2019s influence, the bridge had been named the Harvard Bridge. MIT had tried its best to change that annoying name, but to no avail.</p><br/><p>Some Harvard students were planning on following the group of Columbia students to MIT, with the aim of bullying the students there again. They wanted to watch the world burn.</p><br/><p>At an MIT dorm, some boys were typing on their laptops. Suddenly, one of them told his friends, \"Hey, come and see! There is a celebrity coming to our college.\"</p><br/><p>Science and engineering geeks hated people like Qin Guan, who were cunning, rich, and good at flirting with girls.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! It\u2019s a pity that we barely have any girls at our college. Shall we plan something for him?\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you think?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\"</p><br/><p>\"I know where those money-oriented guys from Columbia are staying. Shall we go?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>After making careful arrangements, the boys fell asleep with smiles on their faces.</p><br/><p>The next morning, they hid around the corner of the hallway, staring at the dormitory where Qin Guan was staying. It was time for harvest.</p><br/><p>The door opened and the celebrity came out.</p><br/><p>It was a pretty girl with long black hair and fair skin. Her face looked like a flower blooming in the morning sunshine.</p><br/><p>A goddess!</p><br/><p>The slender girl was full of energy. She looked like the first snow on a summit.</p><br/><p>\"Bloody hell! A girl!\"</p><br/><p>\"A goddess!\"</p><br/><p>\"We made a mistake!\"</p><br/><p>They suddenly realized they had made a terrible mistake. Before they could figure out a solution, they rushed over to the girl.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m the hero who will save the girl! Suddenly, friends became enemies. \"Hey, beautiful! Stop!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was shocked. Wow! Her eyes are so beautiful!</p><br/><p>Smiling and drooling like silly, they dashed into different directions without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Bang! A hand was caught in a rat trap.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\" a boy cried out. When he saw Cong Nianwei\u2019s long curled eyelashes, he tried to calm down. \"It doesn\u2019t hurt! It\u2019s just like getting attacked by an oyster.\"</p><br/><p>This f*cking hurts!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, something flew over. Before Cong Nianwei could react, a head blocked her way. The thin boy had been hit by a large eraser.</p><br/><p>Despite the white powder all over him, the boy was mesmerized by Cong Nianwei's smile.</p><br/><p>Life is so beautiful!</p><br/><p>Before Cong Nianwei's smile could fade away, the final trap was triggered.</p><br/><p> Crack... Bang... Ouch!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei stepped aside instinctively to avoid the final attack.</p><br/><p>A small bucket of dirty water fell down, landing on the head of a third boy. There were still some dirty cloths in it. With that strange hat on his head, the boy looked like a clown that had escaped from the circus.</p><br/><p>Lying down on the floor, the three boys tried their best to fight against the traps. Cong Nianwei couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Her smile shocked them. They just sat there, lost in their romantic fantasies.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

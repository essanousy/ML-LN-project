The US had been a melting pot in 1948. Asian, African and Latin immigrants had made a large family together.</p><br/><p> Lott's speech had expelled the Asian race from the system. By taking advantage of 9/11, he hadn't left a way out for other races.</p><br/><p> Okay. Now let\u2019s wait and see.</p><br/><p> Lott had no time to attend to other things. According to Xu's father, in a few days, he would quit from his position as leader of the party.</p><br/><p> He wouldn\u2019t have lost his status, if he hadn\u2019t behaved foolishly.</p><br/><p> As a good boy, Qin Guan had no idea about the situation. Prof. Martin praised him for his homework.</p><br/><p> The old man really loved his engagement. He attached great importance to Qin Guan's work, which showed his abundant knowledge and seriousness.</p><br/><p> Before the class, he had tasted the best scented tea in China, which was jasmine tea. It had been a gift from his Chinese old friend.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan would have laughed out loud if he had seen the tea leaves. They had been just ordinary products from Zhangyiyuan, worth 80 yuan. He wouldn't have had the heart to reveal the secret though.</p><br/><p> Jasmine tea from Zhangyiyuan had the best fragrance. It was a typical trick of the 100 year-old store.</p><br/><p> The straightforward old man said, \"I will praise one student and criticize another. Qin Guan, you did well. Even though you are a foreign student, you have adapted to Columbia really fast. You are definitely the top student in this class.\"</p><br/><p> Prof. Martin was a strict instructor, so everyone was shocked by his comments. Only Qin Guan remained calm.</p><br/><p> You have not sat the Chinese College Entrance Examination. We have to finish two papers in one hour. The homework at Columbia was okay for ordinary students, and Qin Guan was no ordinary student. He was gifted.</p><br/><p> Martin was glad to see Qin Guan's calm expression. Suddenly, he sighed and looked towards the back row.</p><br/><p> \"Kuhn, your work was bullsh*t! Are you messing with me? Kuhn? Kuhn?\"</p><br/><p> The students in the back row pushed Kuhn awake. The unlucky boy had fallen asleep. He hadn\u2019t slept at all the previous night.</p><br/><p> Kuhn was still Martin\u2019s favorite student though, so the professor just sighed helplessly. \"Stay here after the class is over.\"</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao pulled at Qin Guan's backpack and gestured towards the Recreation Hall. Qin Guan nodded.</p><br/><p> \"The coffee at Columbia is pretty good. I\u2019ll show you the charm of our university...\" Xu told Qin Guan as he dag for change in his pocket.</p><br/><p> On the square, they saw several boys gathered on the lawn in front of the Roche Library in groups of two or three. They watched the football match there three times a week.</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao explained to Qin Guan, \"Asian students seldom watch it. It's popular here at Columbia though. Matches are often held here. \"</p><br/><p> \"Of course, the basketball team is the best. John, your new friend, is the team captain. Our college team participates in the US college league. We are the top among all Ivy League colleges.\"</p><br/><p> \"Did you see them yesterday? Their disputes are renowned at our university, just like the exciting stories of those wealthy, influential families from the Upper East Side. In fact, most Columbia students are quiet like you.\"</p><br/><p> \"A bookworm can be born in an academic family, and a boy in shabby clothes can be the son of a state governor. Columbia is a cradle for politicians after all. Thanks to wealth, people can pursue their dreams.\"</p><br/><p> Dreams? In this wealth-oriented country? Are you kidding? Only simple Americans would believe that false conception.</p><br/><p> As they chatted, they went through the gym and entered a private dancing studio.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Xu recalled something. He handed Qin Guan a flier. \"It\u2019s the freshman welcoming party. Chinese students organize it.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan looked down at the paper. Interesting. More and more Chinese students were going to US colleges. It was said that the union of Chinese students was very powerful. I could take a look.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan didn't say anything. He began his lesson instead. He taught carefully, and Xu listened just as carefully. Their melodious voices attracted a lot of attention. American guys had no experience with such melodies.</p><br/><p> Whey they finished and were about to leave, they saw a line of heads along the window.</p><br/><p> The leader of the theater club had hastened there at the call of a friend. He was eager to discover new talent. It was the beginning of the semester, so it was the best time for societies to find fresh blood. That way, they would get more points when they were evaluated by the university.</p><br/><p> Unlike societies in China, societies at Columbia were independent and responsible for their own profits and losses. The administration of the university had the right to supervise their function and budget though.</p><br/><p> It was a pity that Qin Guan turned down the invitation of the theater club. He had his own plans. Xu tried to persuade him not to make a quick decision.</p><br/><p> When the crowd dismissed itself, a girl stayed behind.</p><br/><p> It was Wendy, the proud girl he had met before. She had stayed to try and convince Qin Guan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

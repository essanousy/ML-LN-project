They were busy carrying commodities, when somebody shouted outside, \"Hey! Who dares enter my domain?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing the familiar voice, Qin Guan went out and saw Lan Jin. He did not look silly like usual. Instead of his luxury car, he had driven a worn truck all the way from Long Island. Xu Xiaoxiao was in the passenger seat.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt helpless against the two guys, who were much more excited than usual. Birds of a feather always flocked together. Why were all the men around him so unreliable?</p><br/><p>He shot a glance at Cong Nianwei, who was wrapping ceramics in cotton cloth carefully. On the contrary, the women around me are calm and capable.</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoxiao jumped out of the truck, surprised to see Qin Guan there.</p><br/><p>\"Stop! Lan Jin! It\u2019s one of us! Hold your fire!\"</p><br/><p>He was waving a big broadsword around. It seemed to be his choice of a defensive weapon. What was his father thinking? Does he believe so much in his son, or has he given up on him?</p><br/><p>The broadsword was shining coldly in the night. It had to be a martial arts demonstration prop. It was pretty, but basically useless.</p><br/><p>His UN army could not tell the difference though. They were in awe of Qin Guan\u2019s friend, who looked like a martial artist.</p><br/><p>\"Stop that rubbish! There\u2019s only a few things left. Let\u2019s finish as soon as possible.\" Cong Nianwei couldn't stand those clowns. They were delaying their work.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m coming...\"</p><br/><p>There was a car parked across the street. Charlie was observing the situation through his binoculars, sitting in the passenger seat next to Franklin.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like the boss is packing things up. They are not like those artists on the Upper East Side though. They are bad boys like us.\"</p><br/><p>Franklin threw his cigarette butt out and replied calmly, \"Let\u2019s just try them.\" He shot at the store without a warning. Bang!</p><br/><p>The quiet was broken by the shot. Qin Guan suddenly stopped in his tracks. Who? Where? What happened?</p><br/><p>Hiding behind the car, he waved at Cong Nianwei, who was inside the shop. Run! Leave me here! Go to the back garden through the side door!</p><br/><p>He was hoping that it was just some thieves who wanted to make a fortune, but Joseph and Coulibaly were really excited. They shouted at Cella together, \"Turn off the lights!\" Then Coulibaly disappeared silently.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by his heroic actions. Suddenly, he saw Joseph take the gun that was behind his back and load it. Am I about to watch an action film for free?</p><br/><p>Bang, bang, bang...</p><br/><p>Sparkles were shining on the dark street. Joseph was shooting from behind the car with a happy smile.</p><br/><p>\"Bloody hell!\" Franklin and his partner rolled away from the car.</p><br/><p>Bang! A bullet flew over their heads. Franklin shot back.</p><br/><p>\"Ha! They are not far away! There! Northwest!\" Joseph smiled wide in the dark as he turned his gun in that direction.</p><br/><p>\"Bastards! If only I had superpowers!\" Xu was terrified in the face of real danger. He had thrown his broadsword away.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, you throw something to divert them. I\u2019ll take them out with my gun!\" Joseph shouted at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked around. Throw what? A ceramic? I\u2019ll go bankrupt. I better find some bricks...</p><br/><p>He threw a few bricks at their enemies.</p><br/><p>After an accurate calculation of gravitational acceleration, wind force and angle, Qin Guan found his target. The two men escaped from the bullets, but were caught by the bricks. They started shouting abuse at them. Can\u2019t you just stick to the gunfight?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was happy with his achievement. He ran out of ammo soon though.</p><br/><p>Franklin cheered up at the lack of flying bricks. \"Bastard! Ran out of ammo, did you? Ha ha... You piece of dogsh*t!\"</p><br/><p>Americans loved dogs a lot more than the Chinese.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

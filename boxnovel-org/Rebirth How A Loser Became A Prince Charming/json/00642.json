When Qin Guan saw the volunteer security staff clearly, he wanted to find a quiet corner to rest.</p><br/><p>It was Han Zhujiu and his men, all of them looking happy and energetic. They were all fierce, aggressive Asians.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan forced a smile at Han and pulled Xu to a corner.</p><br/><p>\"What are they doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Xu grinned at him. \"This is a newly-established security company! Those professional veterans will treat you like a national leader. Aren't they cool?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. Yes, but they better be legal. Otherwise, we'll see the headline \"New York Police Catches Chinatown Gang Leader\" tomorrow morning.</p><br/><p>It was wonderful to see his compatriots set up a legal business.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan relaxed and participated in the event with great enthusiasm. Before the cameras could get into position, the first wave of customers had already poured in.</p><br/><p>They were the parents of the primary and middle school students of the area. They wanted to buy some biscuits and cakes made by their kids.</p><br/><p>The food was cheap, but there was a large quantity. Samples were placed on the table, and the parents picked them up with a toothpick and tried them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was busy selling goods, when he suddenly heard the young man in charge of the promotion team scream.</p><br/><p>\"There's so many customers! All the packed goods have been sold out!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is there anything left in stock?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p> \"Why are you whining then? Pack everything up!\"</p><br/><p>The young man nearly burst into tears. \"Look at that long line! I'm not a professional salesman. I'm too slow to serve them. They will lose their patience!\"</p><br/><p>The other guys also started to worry. Qin Guan put down the small plates he was carrying.</p><br/><p>\"Can you show me how to pack them? I have very fast fingers.\"</p><br/><p>\"You?\"</p><br/><p>They shot a look at Qin Guan's delicate fingers. They seemed unfamiliar with such hard work. Did he just want to show off?</p><br/><p>A senior staff member rolled his eyes and told the young man, \"There is strength in numbers! Just show Mr. Qin how to do it!\"</p><br/><p>The young man began wrapping a cake with shaking fingers. He was using a plastic box, some colorful paper and ribbons. A bow had to form in the middle of the ribbons. It was a complicated process and the young man was a volunteer, not a professional. It took him about three minutes to wrap one cake.</p><br/><p>When they realized that the packages on the table were almost sold out, Qin Guan rolled up his sleeves and got to work.</p><br/><p>That young man likes showing off.</p><br/><p>Both the senior staff and everyone else was shocked by Qin Guan's eagerness.</p><br/><p>As soon as he sat down, he put five empty boxes in front him in a row, his fingers dancing like butterflies between them.</p><br/><p>He worked like a robot, his every move very exact. Before anyone could see the content of the boxes clearly, he had decorated them with colorful paper and ribbons. He could wrap the boxes with one hand and make a bow with the other one. It took him only one minute to finish five boxes.</p><br/><p>Despite his help though, the line did not get any shorter, as even more customers were attracted by his work. They all lingered around, reluctant to leave.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, Qin Guan looked up from the boxes and saw a crowd.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I'm the dog walker from the park. I came here to help because of you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! I'll buy two more!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Do it more slowly! I want to take a picture of you!\"</p><br/><p>The director behind the camera was so excited that he felt as if he was about to have a heart attack. This was all perfect material!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

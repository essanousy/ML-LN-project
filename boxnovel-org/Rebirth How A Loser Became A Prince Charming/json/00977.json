His wax figure would be unveiled soon, and other similar figures would be transported to China as soon as the first one had settled in at the headquarters.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was the most famous Chinese film actor, so there would be a wax figure of him in every Madame Tussauds Museum around the world.</p><br/><p> Of course, the unveiling ceremony of the first sculpture was particularly significant, so the Chinese media had travelled to London for the event.</p><br/><p> The British media was also familiar with Qin Guan, so the ceremony was almost as grand as the one on the Walk of Fame. Actually, there was a crazy competition between the British and the American media.</p><br/><p> Two red Chinese lanterns were hanging at the entrance, adding a delightful vibe to the New Year's event. Reporters were standing in their own areas, waiting in silence.</p><br/><p> As Qin Guan's car drew near, they all lifted their cameras.</p><br/><p> This was an inside joke of theirs.</p><br/><p> Lights flashed all around as the reporters followed Qin Guan. When his foot touched the red carpet, the lights would be turned on. As soon as he left, they would be turned off. The event was like a silent TV drama.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan, who was amused, tried to jump forward, but the smart reporters caught up with him.</p><br/><p> The Chinese reporters remained silent. They couldn't find a single word to express their feelings.</p><br/><p> Fortunately, the red carpet event was short. When Qin Guan reached the entrance, all the Chinese reporters smiled in relief.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan pulled the red curtain down to reveal his wax figure. If one didn't compare it to the real person, the wax figure seemed pretty good.</p><br/><p> The craftsman, who was a fan of Qin Guan's, had put great care into the piece of art. In his opinion, every little detail was perfect. At first, he had thought that it looked as if it were alive. When the real person was standing next to it though, the figure was tarnished by the comparison.</p><br/><p> The sculpture looked like Qin Guan's shadow. The reporters took pictures energetically, without uttering a single word of praise. One picture was worth 1,000 words after all.</p><br/><p> The director of the museum felt sad. He could foresee the reaction of the readers and the audience.</p><br/><p> By the time Qin Guan flew to America the next morning, the news had been published in both China and the UK. Fans around the world had finally seen the wax figure.</p><br/><p> The photographers had been partial. They had taken close-up photos of Qin Guan meticulously. One could even have counted the hair on his eyebrows in those pictures. The wax figure had not been as lucky, though.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

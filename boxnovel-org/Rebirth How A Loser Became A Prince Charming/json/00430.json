Everyone fixed their eyes on Michael Douglas, the winner of the Oscar for Best Actor in 2000.</p><br/><p>Douglas, who was older than Catherine Zeta-Jones by 20 years, had won his first Oscar after they\u2019d gotten married. As a result, people said that he had won the award because of Catherine\u2019s fortune.</p><br/><p>It was an Oscar tradition to make dirty jokes during the ceremony. If one didn\u2019t know, they would have been confused.</p><br/><p>The crowd quieted down eventually, and the large screen on the stage changed. Director Zhang couldn\u2019t help but straighten his back. Finally, the time had come.</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s announce the Best Foreign Film of the 75th Oscars. The nominees include \u2018El Crimen del padre Amaro\u2019 from Mexico, \u2018I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore\u2019 from Germany, \u2018The Man Without A Past\u2019 from Finland, and \u2018Heroes\u2019 from China.\"</p><br/><p>The highlights of each film were played on the screen as the host made an introduction. When he came to \"Heroes\", the black solemn Qin palace appeared on the screen. Li Lianjie was standing in the center of the frame with a murderous look on his face. Red satin ribbons, yellow sand and white petals were dancing around him.</p><br/><p>It was a typical, yet impressive oriental film. Even informed famous directors couldn\u2019t help but fix their eyes on the screen.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that the highlights lasted no more than 10 seconds. Before people could get a general idea, the video switched fast to another film.</p><br/><p>Finally, the light on the screen faded away. Steve Martin opened the envelope that contained the name of the final winner. \"The winner for Best Foreign Film of the 75th Oscars is... \u2018I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore\u2019 from Germany!\"</p><br/><p>Caroline Link, who was sitting only two rows in front of Zhang Yimou, hugged her producer upon hearing the news. In her film, the female director had depicted a cruel war from an exquisite point of view. The film\u2019s alternate title was \"Nowhere in Africa\".</p><br/><p>Another reason the film had won the award was the ongoing war in Iraq. American people were sympathetic about the devastation caused by the war.</p><br/><p>The camera turned in the direction of Qin Guan and Director Zhang. Qin Guan was in no mood to expose himself in such a way, but Director Zhang remained calm and expressionless. When he looked at the female director though, he seemed jealous. Words couldn't express his feelings.</p><br/><p>That award had been his goal for so many years. It was an acknowledgement of all the zeal he had put into his work. His heart was full of mixed emotions. Men did not shed tears easily though, so the Chinese man had no outlet for his feelings.</p><br/><p>Silence. Endless silence. This was the closest he had ever gotten to winning an Oscar. It was a pity that he had missed his chance.</p><br/><p>The rest of the ceremony was peaceful for Director Zhang and Qin Guan. The next jokes and awards had nothing to do with them.</p><br/><p>The stars were twinkling above the theater as everyone went out. Some people looked happy, while others looked depressed. After one day of noise, the place finally quieted down. Sister Xue was waiting for them.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang looked unconsciously at the clean night sky and covered his eyes gently with his hand.</p><br/><p>\"Are the stars dazzling?\" Sister Xue looked up at the sky.</p><br/><p>Zhang Weiping held his laughter back. He had originally wanted to comfort his old friend.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang felt at a loss. He didn\u2019t know whether he should cry or laugh. Actually, he was luckier than most people in the film circle.</p><br/><p>He had been to the Walk of Fame. He had attended an Oscar ceremony. His film had been nominated for an award.</p><br/><p>His dream would go on. Cheers! To the filmmakers and directors in China!</p><br/><p>\"We should drink something.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's a pity to attend such a show and not have a late night snack.\"</p><br/><p>\"There\u2019s a canteen over there!\"</p><br/><p>They bought Mexican corn cakes from a canteen beside the theater, ignoring the looks they got from everyone around them. They couldn\u2019t resist their stomachs and the temptation of delicious food.</p><br/><p>This was also the most delicious Mexican food in Los Angeles. A large box of Tito\u2019s Tacos cost only 20 dollars. They enjoyed their cakes without dignity at the entrance of the theater.</p><br/><p>The cakes were made of fresh corn kernels instead of corn flour. The brown cakes were sweet and fresh. There was New Orleans roast, fresh red onions, and green peppers in the cakes. Combined with some green onions and black pepper, the cake was really a surprise.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a big bite. The onlookers around him swallowed their saliva. That Asian boy seems to be enjoying his cake so much!</p><br/><p>The roast was tender with a crispy crust. The pressure of his teeth made the juices flow out and ran down along his mouth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

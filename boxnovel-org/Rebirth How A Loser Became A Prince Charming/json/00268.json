Sister Xue went on, \"Today, the Citizen flagship store in Hengji will open for business, and Qin Guan will have his first autographed copy sale. You are all fans of him. Are you excited?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\" the girls answered in one voice.</p><br/><p>\"The fans who got an invitation were the luckiest ones in Asia. Do you think this is fair for them?\"</p><br/><p>Some fans murmured, \"It's unfair for us.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue tried to convince them, \"This is Qin Guan\u2019s first meet-and-greet. There are fans here from other countries. What you\u2019re doing will not just inconvenience your idol, but also have international consequences\"</p><br/><p>The fans still mumbled sadly, \"We are unhappy too.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue came up with a proposal, \"I have good news for everyone. There are fans here from everywhere. You all like Qin Guan, so we also have something for you. Now, listen to me.\"</p><br/><p>The fans were comforted by her words. There will be a surprise!</p><br/><p>It was human nature. Their original expectations had been destroyed by the organizers, so they had planned on resisting till the very end, but the new proposal had mitigated the situation and eased their anxiety.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue waved at them. \"Follow my orders. Please form two lines. Fans with invitations on the right, and others on the left.\"</p><br/><p>The interpreter got to work, and the fans lined up obediently. Not bad. The two lines are about the same length.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue pointed to the fans on the right. \"Hand in your invitation to the security staff and enter the hall one by one.\"</p><br/><p>Then she turned to the girls on the left. \"Do you see the big board over there? I promise that Qin Guan will meet you there in an hour and a half.\"</p><br/><p>They all looked in that direction and saw a man standing there happily with a giant poster of Qin Guan in his hands.</p><br/><p>J Clothing was always keen on seizing a chance.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was a smart woman and she had noticed the J Clothing store on her way out of the elevator. She had originally just considered it a coincidence that J clothing also had a store in Hengji Plaza. Ten minutes later though, it came in handy.</p><br/><p>She had a short discussion with the Citizen director. She had to get their approval before bringing another brand in.</p><br/><p>The director approved her plan without hesitation, as it wouldn't influence their meeting. It would only relieve the chaos.</p><br/><p>Everything else was quite easy. Sister Xue called the J Clothing boss, who was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan is my lucky star. In Xidan, my brand is promoted by LEE. The sales volume there was tripled last year. Now I\u2019ll get Citizen\u2019s help!</p><br/><p>He attached great importance to that opportunity. After several calls, his staff rushed over.</p><br/><p>In the past, such a thing would have been impossible, but now the store in Hengje was cleared up in 15 minutes.</p><br/><p>The ignorant fans were led into the store. The Hengji manager wiped his sweat off secretly.</p><br/><p>That was a close call! Thanks to their trouble, the two brands cooperated and put the situation under control. It was wonderful!</p><br/><p>When the fans were all inside the store, the J Clothing staff handed out posters of Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Surprise! The posters had originally been only for J Clothing customers.</p><br/><p>The manager in charge of promotion ran over in a hurry. The cunning man had been entrusted with a mission at that critical moment.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, please...\"</p><br/><p>The fans calmed down. Meanwhile, Qin Guan let out a long breath of relief after being updated about the situation.</p><br/><p>The opening ceremony was completed in an orderly manner. The ribbon was cut and all the attendants applauded.</p><br/><p>The fans with invitations were getting impatient. They were there for Qin Guan, not for that f*cking ceremony.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the speech lasted only for 10 minutes, or they would have rebelled again. Finally, their moment was there.</p><br/><p>They took out their albums and opened the covers, where the picture of a Citizen watch was printed. The designer had skillfully left enough space for a signature on the picture.</p><br/><p>The functional art of Citizen took all kinds of things, no matter how big or trivial, into consideration.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was sitting behind a table in the same grey suit he was wearing in the album. The autographed copy sale began.</p><br/><p>The first lucky girl walked forward. She was too excited to say anything. Qin Guan smiled at her and signed the album before returning it to her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

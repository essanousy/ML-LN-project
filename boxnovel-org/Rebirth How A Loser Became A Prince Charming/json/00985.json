They had to have the common sense of a soldier, participate in the daily training and have dinner in the big messy army dining hall.</p><br/><p>Their stay with ordinary soldiers would help them get to know the Chinese military. Being a soldier was not about symbols or titles. It was all about the spirit in one's blood.</p><br/><p>Soldiers were unique people with specific manners. They were simple, determined and considerate with others.</p><br/><p>According to Director Kang's plan, they would have to blend into the large military family as an independent team before they started shooting.</p><br/><p>This was not a simple task.</p><br/><p>The shooting sites covered three military regions, so they had to follow the schedule of the army. They got up really early and went to bed late at night, so they were as exhausted as mules pulling a mill all day long.</p><br/><p>The other actors didn't forget Qin Guan, who was the only one to avoid this misery. They all swore to torture the lucky guy as soon as he arrived.</p><br/><p>Wang Baoqiang, who was the most honest one among them, didn't consider this a good idea. \"Is that proper? He is Brother Qin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Qin? In the army, there are only veterans and new recruits. We are all older than him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! That will be a whack!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about the danger awaiting him.</p><br/><p>This would be his first time meeting soldiers up close, so everything seemed really interesting to him. What a wonderful experience!</p><br/><p>A military officer led Qin Guan to the camp. He was a fan of his, so he was really excited to be assigned this task.</p><br/><p>He had gone to the cinema during the holidays and watched \"I Am Legend\". Both he and his comrades worshipped Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to Wang Liying. \"Girls are not allowed to stay here. You can return to the hotel. I'll call you if I need you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Will you be okay?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. I'll be staying with the people's army!\"</p><br/><p>He patted the officer on the shoulder, making the man flush with excitement. The officer saluted Wang. \"I promise I'll take care of him!\"</p><br/><p>The two of them headed to the new light yellow dormitory building, which had been especially prepared for the crew.</p><br/><p>When they reached the door, the officer became shy again.</p><br/><p>\"I can't go in, Brother Qin. See you later!\" The man ran away as fast as a rabbit.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Where are you going?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the man's retreating back as he pushed the door open.</p><br/><p>The officer had escaped just in time to avoid the actors' plan.</p><br/><p>As soon as he entered the dormitory, Qin Guan noticed that everyone inside seemed to be staring at him. All the actors were standing by their beds. When they saw him clearly, they let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome, Qin Guan!\" They applauded happily. Duan Yihong and Chen Sicheng smiled. The men got to know each other soon. Everyone was looking forward to the grand feast the soldiers would organize for them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

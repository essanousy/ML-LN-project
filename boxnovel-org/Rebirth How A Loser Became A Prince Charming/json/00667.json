The baboons booed at him in dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Depressed, Qin Guan followed Cong Nianwei out of the park.</p><br/><p>Their fourth stop had been a failure as well.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei looked back at her boyfriend. Fantasies were beautiful, but reality was cruel. He had given more thought to their youthful memories.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei stretched her hand toward the popcorn box. Qin Guan was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\"It's sweet, but cold.\"</p><br/><p>She was right. Their love was warm enough for them. Qin Guan smiled behind his thick scarf.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Win a doll for me. Over there! At the balloon stand!\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\"</p><br/><p>At the exit of the park was a group of peddlers. Their turf was marked by some plain prizes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan lifted the gun, which had a simple wooden butt, and used both his childhood memories and what he had learned during his military training.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The colorful balloons burst at the sound. Every shot was executed perfectly. The stand owner was annoyed. If all customers were that good at shooting, he would go bankrupt.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could choose any prize he wanted, but Cong Nianwei pointed at a lovely bear.</p><br/><p>\"I want that one!\"</p><br/><p>The stand owner rushed to take the bear down. He was scared. He had originally thought that the girl would choose the remote-controlled car, but she had picked the ugly bear instead.</p><br/><p>He handed Cong Nianwei the bear, flicking the dust off its fur considerately.</p><br/><p>\"Here you go. Thank you for playing!\"</p><br/><p>The bear filled Cong Nianwei's embrace, its legs swaying over her feet. Qin Guan tucked the bear under his arm and pulled Cong Nianwei out of the park.</p><br/><p>\"It's a bit rough, but it's lovely.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, it's ugly. Didn't I bring you a teddy bear from the UK? You always spend time at the gallery. I didn't think you would like such a bear.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei took the bear to allow Qin Guan to start his bike.</p><br/><p>\"I've gotten used to sleeping next to you. I feel alone without you at home.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan paused and shot a surprised, incredulous look at his girlfriend. The proud, calm girl was not usually this shy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan took off his scarf and kissed her on the lips. They expressed their love shamelessly before the surrounding peddlers and students.</p><br/><p>The handsome man and the pretty girl were very attractive. The passersby all started whispering to each other.</p><br/><p>\"That young man is so handsome!\"</p><br/><p>\"He looks like the famous Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"But he must be in America right now. There have been no news about him returning to China.\"</p><br/><p>\"But he looks so much like him...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan realized he had acted carelessly. He and Cong Nianwei spoke through their eyes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan: What shall we do?</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei: Just stay calm and deny any connection. They can't confirm it any other way.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan: Then what?</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei: Let's just leave as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan: Good idea!</p><br/><p>They ran to the bike calmly under the curious gazes of the crowd, when suddenly a roar exposed them.</p><br/><p>Y was a small city, so one came across acquaintances everywhere. Zhou Jin, who lived close to the park, noticed Qin Guan as he was taking out the garbage.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! You are back!\" Zhou Jin shouted, running over to them excitedly. \"Hey! Stop! I'm not a ghost! Are you acting like you don't know me just because you are famous? Hey!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei got worried. All the spectators' eyes lit up as the couple got ready to run away.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan mounted the bike and nodded at Cong Nianwei. \"Get on!\" Cong Nianwei rushed to the running bike and leapt on it with the bear in her arms.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Silver Eagle Festival was about to open, and everyone was busy preparing for the ceremony. Most activities had been pushed aside for the festival, but just two days before the event, Wang Jingcao took action.</p><br/><p>News about Qin Guan started spreading around mainstream websites. The web star quickly got to the top of the charts.</p><br/><p>Visitors saw small voting areas on the homepages of web portals. They were black and white, just like the VOGUE cover had been.</p><br/><p>They looked conspicuous and mysterious among the other colorful photos.</p><br/><p>\"Asia Fashion Men is inviting you to vote.\"</p><br/><p>Some curious users clicked on it. The title sounds good.</p><br/><p>They were disappointed by the introduction though.</p><br/><p>There was information about 20 models from different Asian countries. Their photos were all on the same page, their nationalities and ages noted right under them. If one clicked on a photo, they would see the model\u2019s resume, height, size and brand.</p><br/><p>The concept of voting online was interesting, but the buttons under the photos were grey. On the bottom, there was a line of words: Voting will be open from January 1st to January 3rd, 2002.</p><br/><p>This was just the warm-up. Some guys took it as a joke, but there were also many who took it seriously.</p><br/><p>They were curious about the strange modelling circle. The boys in the photos looked like fairies.</p><br/><p>They noticed a serious problem: There were only two Chinese men among the candidates. As a country with such a large population, that rate was way too low.</p><br/><p>Many people decided that they would support Qin Guan, the only model they recognized. They ignored the second model, Shao Xiaobing, because of his inferior popularity.</p><br/><p>Qu was looking at the voting page doubtfully. The promotion was not strong enough in her opinion. What was Wang thinking about?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, her phone rang, attracting her attention. She got to work, leaving Qin Guan behind.</p><br/><p>Qu was right, but Wang already had plans to take care of the situation.</p><br/><p>She had originally planned on assigning an image advisor to help Qin Guan with his outfit for the festival. Then she realized that Sister Xue could do it. Qin Guan had never made any mistakes in public.</p><br/><p>It was safe for him to wear something straight and narrow for his debut.</p><br/><p>They all flied to Changsha to attend the festival on November 5th.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was busy putting on his custom-made suit, a group of strange people took over internet cafes.</p><br/><p>A strong man watched his part-time staff fill an internet cafe that could host about 100 people.</p><br/><p>When everyone was seated, he cleared his throat and said, \"Attention! Your work today is to vote. Later, I\u2019ll give you a list and some instructions on voting. Look here!\"</p><br/><p>He pointed to a small TV hanging from the ceiling. \"When they begin to count down, you just start voting again and again. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Some people were hesitant. A brave one asked, \"Brother, this will take only several minutes. Will I get 15 yuan for the whole day?\"</p><br/><p>The strong man looked at him disdainfully. The thin, smaller man had stinky hair and messy clothes. He looked like he was an internet addict.</p><br/><p>He grinned and announced, \"You\u2019ll get a salary and free lunch. The job will take four days. I can't let you guys out.\"</p><br/><p>People grew excited at his words. It was quite a good job, and it would only take them some time. They were all up to the task.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the same scene was repeated in different internet bars.</p><br/><p>The host of the opening ceremony sat up in the dressing room. Busy staff were shuttling back and forth.</p><br/><p>The office of the committee was in chaos.</p><br/><p>A producer was shouting to the head of the committee with red cheeks, waving a pile of tickets at him.</p><br/><p>\"Stop talking about the new rules! Never before has a committee acted like yours! I have won three Silver Eagle Awards! I know the rules very well! I know them even better than you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, your awards are not as prestigious as the Flying and May the First awards, but they\u2019re also national awards. You should expect an uproar in the circle if you insist on acting like this.\"</p><br/><p>\"I have never seen a voting ticket like this one! You bound others to my tickets! I paid for this! Why do I have to pay for others? I just want to vote for my show! Why do I have to fill in the other three blanks on the ticket? I have spent 100,000 yuan on promotion. Why should three other productions profit at my expense? Are you kidding me? This is unfair!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

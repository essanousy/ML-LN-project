In an effort to challenge the Hunan Station, the Dragon Station had changed the show's airtime and tried its best to improve the program all around.</p><br/><p>They had also invited some famous stars, including Fan Pingping and Annie Yi, for publicity reasons. They were both talking with Lin happily.</p><br/><p>Huang Xiaoming, who had also been invited, was sitting with his fans. By that time, he had already become known as the most handsome guy in the world. Wherever he was and whatever he did, the expression on his face was always confident.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Qin Guan arrived right at that moment. Although he was the same age as Fan Pingping and Huang Xiaoming, he took the lead. The way he walked to his seat wordlessly spoke volumes about his status.</p><br/><p>Dragon Television had set strict criteria for the audience on site. Only loyal fans with fan club certificates could get an invitation. They had to keep the competition smooth by helping the staff maintain the order. Thus, when the judges and guests started to arrive, the fans controlled themselves and tried not to get over-excited.</p><br/><p>However, Qin Guan's arrival broke the silence. The girls screamed out in an effort to express their love and waved LED boards in the direction of Qin Guan's seat. The other stars felt a little embarrassed. They had only heard a couple of claps when they had entered the site.</p><br/><p>The response of the fans was the final acknowledgement of a star's value. Huang Xiaoming couldn't stay in his seat. Although they were the same age, he stood up, walked over to Qin Guan and stretched out his right hand.</p><br/><p>\"How are you, Brother Qin? I'm Huang Xiaoming. I've heard a lot about you from Director Zhang Jizhong.\"</p><br/><p>\"How are you?\" Qin Guan shook his hand. \"You are really polite. I thought you were older than me.\"</p><br/><p>Fan Pingping approached them. She came from the same town as Huang.</p><br/><p>\"I can confirm his words. Qin Guan is the same age as me. We were all born in 1980.\"</p><br/><p>Her words made Huang feel awkward.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan changed the topic. \"So you are the protagonist in Director Zhang's film? It's a good film.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it is. I would like to thank you. I only got the role because you were abroad at the time. I also want to thank you for not leaking the news. I wouldn't have accepted the role otherwise.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why?\"</p><br/><p>Because I didn't want the audience to compare me with you!</p><br/><p>They talked happily until the final eventually began and everyone had to return to their own seat. Qin Guan was sitting in the middle of the judge panel, so that the cameramen's job was easier.</p><br/><p>People were never treated equally.</p><br/><p>When the music started playing, everyone began to anticipate the start of the exciting final.</p><br/><p>\"All the contestants of the final round will show up now,\" Fan Pingping whispered to Qin Guan. She had studied them all carefully.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a meaningful look at her. Fan flushed.</p><br/><p>\"I had to get to know the next generation.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned his eyes to the stage. As Fan had said, the 10 contestants had gotten on the stage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan found their outfits terrible. He had worked in the fashion circle, so he was a pretty picky guy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

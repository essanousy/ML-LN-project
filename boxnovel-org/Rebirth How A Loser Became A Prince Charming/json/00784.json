The plateau hypoxia caused them to grow small, but unlike their homebred brothers, they tasted really good.</p><br/><p>The cook roasted the meat on the fire with a special sauce. When it was taken from the firewood, the skin was a crystal-like jelly that felt like plastic in one's mouth.</p><br/><p>The pigs lived on natural food, so people couldn't find meat like that in big city restaurants. If one felt greasy, they could have a cup of local beer. A heated potato bun completed the dinner, making it perfect.</p><br/><p>The potato buns in Tibet were different. The natives smashed the plateau potatoes into a sauce and mixed it with homemade butter and milk. The potatoes contained a high starch percentage, so they could be made into soft dough.</p><br/><p>Fried flavored yak meat was used as a filling. The buns were then slowly fried in oil. Thanks to the high altitude, the oil didn't burn on the plateau. That was how that simple delicious food was made.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan buried his face into his bowl, not caring about his image. He felt sorry that they couldn't take home takeaway. He wondered if Cong Nianwei was missing him during their long separation, or if she felt lonely in their empty house.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he only received a hasty kiss from her after returning to the capital before she had to rush back to her post. Sister Xue had a strict expression on her face as she waited for him in her office.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room was solemn and silent. Qin Guan was shocked.</p><br/><p>\"You are about to get married, Sister Xue! You have so many important things to do. What are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>As soon as he sat down and started trying to ease the tense atmosphere, Sister Xue handed him a news announcement. The next day, it would be on the headlines of all entertainment sections.</p><br/><p>\"Wang Jingcao has officially left Huayi and joined Tiancheng Entertainment Co Ltd.\"</p><br/><p>\"All the VIPs followed her. Huayi lost half the country.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked up from the striking title. \"Is anyone staying with Huayi? Did any famous director leave?\"</p><br/><p>\"None of the directors have made a clear announcement. With enough investment, this won't be a big problem for them. There are plenty of actors in China, so Huayi will not be shorthanded. The only issue is the famous actors. They are the key to any firm.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan relaxed as he listened to her report. He was the third most powerful shareholder of Huayi after all. He didn't want to see the firm become a shell corporation.</p><br/><p>As the real backbone of the firm, Qin Guan began to assign tasks to everybody.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Xue, could you please go to Huayi with Chen Kang and estimate the loss caused by Wang's departure? Try to find a legal way out. We can't just let her go so easily.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll talk with Huayi's most famous partners. We should at least try to pull the undecided ones back to our camp. Let's act separately.\"</p><br/><p>This meant that Qin Guan's secret identity as Huayi's major shareholder would be revealed to the whole entertainment circle. He had no idea of the influence it might have during such a turbulent period. He didn't look any further into Wang's departure. The woman needed a platform under her own control, not a large firm with a commercial function. Her ideas contradicted the developing trends of the economy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could only try to save the future of those actors. They would have to reshuffle the cards in a completely new environment after all. The actors would only rely on Wang's fame.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan called Zhou Xun first. She was the most talented actress at Huayi, so her name meant a lot.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Sister Zhou. It's Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>She breathed heavily before an unhappy voice came from the other end of the line. \"Just call me by my name, please. I'm busy now. I have no time to chat with you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Will you leave Huayi?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why would I? My contract has not expired yet and the boss is pretty good. What do you want to do? Invite me over to your firm? You are really bold! The brothers have been so kind to you. How dare you...\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no!\" Qin Guan interrupted her. \"It seems like you haven't heard the news. I'll keep it short. Stay at Huayi and stay away from the capital for a few days. Your agent is smart. He didn't tell you anything. That's all. Bye!\"</p><br/><p>He hung up before she could answer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

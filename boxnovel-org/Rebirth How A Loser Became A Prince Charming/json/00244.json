The largest ones are ten small-scale workstations.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took He Qian\u2019s card out of his elegant silver card holder. He waved it before Zhang Zhenqian. \"Have you heard of Stanley? I prepare small things for them.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang laughed. \"You want to buy stock from these guys? They might have just entered the Chinese market, but they are no idiots.\"</p><br/><p>\"If I succeed, will you agree to the shares I suggested?\" Qin Guan asked confidently.</p><br/><p>Zhang's brain was working fervently. No! The ticked objects were screaming at him, reminding him of the considerable profits. He licked his dry lips and said decisively, \"If you convince Stanley, then yes. I\u2019ll accept your proposal.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan clapped his hands. \"Okay! If I convince Stanley, we\u2019ll split the profits eighty to twenty. If we get all three projects, it\u2019ll be forty to sixty. I think Brother Bu and Wang would like to give you a hand.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang felt reassured by the proposal. This young man seems like a good partner.</p><br/><p>He shook the documents before them, reminding them, \"Time is pressing! The bidding evaluators will be isolated one week earlier. They will stay someplace together, away from other people. We have two weeks left. I\u2019ll submit the bidding applications according to your plan. Then you\u2019ll have only one week to gather the capital and convince Stanley.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded calmly. \"One week is enough. Just take care of the documents for me.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang left without a word. He had a lot to do in the following week. He and his staff would have to work overtime.</p><br/><p>Bu Qinlu watched Zhang drive off in his car. Then he asked Qin Guan doubtfully, \"Are you confident that you\u2019ll succeed? You shouldn't strain yourself. We could just lend him some money.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by his sincere words. He was used to a world in which everyone was trying to cheat others. The kind brothers had moved him.</p><br/><p>He poked Bu\u2019s arm playfully. \"I\u2019m earning money for myself. Throw me a bone this time. I\u2019ll provide one third of the capital. 2,000,000, is that okay?\"</p><br/><p>Bu laughed and hugged Qin Guan. Then he told Wang, who was still in a daze, \"Of course, we won\u2019t forget you.\"</p><br/><p>The three of them laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>Everything was settled, so Qin Guan put He Qian\u2019s card away carefully, said goodbye to Bu and Qin, and left the office. He was worried about his strange friends.</p><br/><p>When he entered the room though, he saw that everything was normal.</p><br/><p>It was a big room of about 100 square metres, perfect for private parties.</p><br/><p>There was a bar by the door, and chairs and couches were scattered around the room. There was also a set of sound equipment, and a chess board and cards on a shelf.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked around and saw that Cong Nianwei was not there. \"Where is Cong Nianwei?\" he asked Li Jie.</p><br/><p>Li Jie was playing chess with one of the girls. He took a sip of his tea and pointed to a beautiful swinging door. \"She might be in the oil massage room.\"</p><br/><p>Relieved, Qin Guan sat down on the soft couch and watched the guys in confusion.</p><br/><p>Guan Jian and Liu Xiaoyang were talking about something in low voices by the bar. Guan Jian was sitting and Liu was standing. Liu served tea or gave cigarettes to Guan with pleasure.</p><br/><p>Any time Guan said something to him, Liu would flush in excitement. He was standing perfectly straight like a soldier.</p><br/><p>The weirdest couple though was Lan Jin and He Ming. The two guys from two different worlds were enjoying an extra service of the room: shaving.</p><br/><p>Two experienced masters were working on their faces with shining traditional razors. Their skills were impeccable.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless. Suddenly, Cong Nianwei came out of the massage room looking satisfied. She smiled at her boyfriend and sat down beside him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At the time, oysters and sweet potatoes could be found everywhere in Taiwan. The snack ended up saving the army and helping Zheng win the final victory against the colonists.</p><br/><p>Actually, most of Chinese history involved food.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was in a good mood when he arrived at the award ceremony. Taking into consideration the feedback of the entertainment circle and the long-term aesthetic fatigue of the masses, the organizing committee had tried bringing attention to the event through another method.</p><br/><p>They had chosen a memorable place as a venue and promoted vigorously the attending stars.</p><br/><p>After a serious selecting process, they had decided on the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, a monument built on the 100th anniversary of Mr. Sun. It was a monument of great importance for the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.</p><br/><p>That night, the towering building with the carved beams and painted rafters welcomed a big number of superstars in splendid outfits and makeup. They would be the protagonists of the night.</p><br/><p>The red carpet started at the main entrance of the hall and stretched till the path to the garden. It was surrounded by countless reporters, who had gone there for the exquisite ceremony.</p><br/><p>Lu Chuan arrived early and cleaned his golden-framed glasses again, afraid that he would look inferior next to Qin Guan as they walked together.</p><br/><p>People called Qin Guan the Group Photo Killer. Everyone felt nervous when they were about to be in the same photo with him, but Lu Chuan had to walk with the handsome guy, as \"Ke Ke Xi Li\" was the only finalist from the Chinese mainland that would compete for the most important awards.</p><br/><p>As a result, Lu Chuan had to share the spotlight with Qin Guan. There were many other famous attendants around them. Some of them, such as Zhang Xueyou and Wu Yusen, had gone there for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>People had originally thought that the ceremony would be a competition between Liu Dehua and Liang Chaowei, but Qin Guan's presence had complicated things. Zhang Xueyou, who was a guy that loved to gossip, had travelled to Taiwan. In his opinion, a confrontation between three actors would be more interesting than one between two.</p><br/><p>When a group of Hong Kong stars had received invitations, the undervalued ceremony had suddenly become more popular. The organizing committee felt like bursting into laughter from joy.</p><br/><p>The media acted without delay. The reporters from Japan and the Republic of Korea, who had lost any interest in the festival in the past, had also showed up.</p><br/><p>As a result, the stars were under the illusion that the Taiwanese film industry was still in its prime, when it had reigned over the Chinese industry.</p><br/><p>Their dream was interrupted when they saw Lu Chuan and Qin Guan set their feet on the red carpet hand in hand. All the reporters pointed their cameras at Qin Guan in unison. The scene back at the Berlin Film Festival was recreated in Taipei.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Look here, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you confident about winning the award?\"</p><br/><p>\"Slow down, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>They all followed Qin Guan as he moved forward, making the people behind him feel awkward. No reporter seemed to have noticed them.</p><br/><p>Lin Jiaxin and Wu Yanzu exchanged a glance with a grimace. They had no choice but to keep walking along the carpet.</p><br/><p>Even Wu could be mentioned in the same breath as Qin Guan in that moment. None of his peers could stand next to the actor as equals. In everyone's minds, Qin Guan belonged to the previous generation of actors. The youngest members of the film circle were considered juniors compared to him, even though Qin Guan hadn't even turned 24 yet.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved at the audience at the end of the carpet. Suddenly, he saw the two men behind them, who wanted to share some of the attention of the media.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan slowed down. He wanted to have a word with one of the young men. In his past life, he had been one of the most popular and handsome men in China. Qin Guan used to dream of looking like him.</p><br/><p>He walked up to the Hong Kong actor, looking elegant and charming. He seemed confident and proud.</p><br/><p>Wu and Lin panicked. All the reporters and stars had fixed their eyes on them, waiting for the award-winning actor to show his purpose. They had actually never spoken with him before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

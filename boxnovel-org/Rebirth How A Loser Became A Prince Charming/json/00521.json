Even the waiter paused, for fear of disturbing his performance.</p><br/><p>It was a clean, even tune. Qin Guan retreated with a faint smile on his face, looking slightly drunk. The keyboard player nearly moved to support him, but he stopped when he saw Qin Guan's next move.</p><br/><p>He moved his sleeves and smiled at the audience. Then he turned around and covered his face with the fan.</p><br/><p>Even drunk, he still looked as glorious as ever.</p><br/><p>\"The moon has just left the sea...\" This was not the hoarse voice of a man. It was the power of Mei School.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s gradually rising to the middle of the sky.</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth are visible under the moonlight.</p><br/><p>Chang\u2019e has left the Moon Palace...\"</p><br/><p>It was the classic Peking Opera \"Drunk Concubine\".</p><br/><p>To American people, even the shouts of African tribes sounded like wild songs. Everyone was shocked by Qin Guan's performance. The handsome man was such a beauty! He looked like a foreign myth come alive.</p><br/><p>As the audience lost its mind, Qin Guan folded the fan and changed his tune again.</p><br/><p>Pingtan, Kunqu Opera and Suzhou Opera were the three most famous operas in Suzhou and Hangzhou. Kunqu was the most popular one all over China.</p><br/><p>Most people from North China liked it even better than Peking Opera, as its melody was more elegant and smoother than that of Peking Opera. It warmed their hearts when they heard it.</p><br/><p>The royal concubine Qin Guan had played was a noble beauty. Suddenly, he turned into a boudoir maiden showing off with her orchid-like fingers.</p><br/><p>Such a gentle girl could only have grown up in an ancient water town south of Yangtze River.</p><br/><p>\"No longer busy, I live at leisure,Thinking where I can find pleasure.Writing heartbreaking verses by day,What of love can a lover say?Sitting in my room day and night,The fair scene beautifies my verses,Even in candlelight.For better or worse,if you are worthy of her love,you\u2019ll be gifted a new life from above.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was totally absorbed in the opera as the alcohol in his blood rushed to his brain. Excited, he was not satisfied with those familiar songs. He wanted to give a crazy performance on that stage, before such an amazing audience.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s what he did.</p><br/><p>\"The river flows East.</p><br/><p>The stars worship the Big Dipper...\"[1]</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei wanted to hide in a corner, but Qu started moving towards the stage.</p><br/><p>\"I want to live another 500 years...\"[2]</p><br/><p>Dr. Luke had originally been angry with Paris Hilton for pulling him from his studio and making him come to the party just to introduce an Asian star to him. Suddenly, he was interested in Qin Guan's strange melodies and different kinds of songs though.</p><br/><p>He was not interested in his musical ability, but he liked his diverse style. As a professional musician, he could distinguish between natural sound and ordinary people\u2019s voices.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could probably release a CD. Many stars much worse than him had published their own albums. Dr. Luke would soon find out that he was completely wrong though. Qu got on the stage too late. Qin Guan had already gone too far.</p><br/><p>\"Come on, everybody! The dance is very simple! It\u2019s so easy and funny! Come on! All together now!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stuffed the fan into his collar and began to dance. He was planning on ending the concert with a South Korean song.</p><br/><p>\"Oppan... GANGNAM STYLE...\"</p><br/><p>He made the sign of victory like a villain. Then he stood with his legs wide apart, squatting a little. His hands seemed to be holding imaginary reins as he began his horse-riding dance. It was PSY's popular song \"GANGNAM STYLE\", which would become wildly popular many years later. Thanks to his copycat mania, he could remember it even while drunk.</p><br/><p>He didn't forget to shout at the audience, \"Come on, follow me! GANGNAM STYLE!\"</p><br/><p>The rebellious American boys were the first to be deluded. Following Qin Guan, they turned their crotches towards Nick. They thought it had to be a method one used to provoke their enemy.</p><br/><p>He deserves the most beautiful ladies!</p><br/><p>The girls in the short skirts joined the delighted group, completing the grand scene.</p><br/><p>Nick was surrounded, everyone making strange gestures at him. If one made an ass out of themselves, they couldn\u2019t complain if people rode them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

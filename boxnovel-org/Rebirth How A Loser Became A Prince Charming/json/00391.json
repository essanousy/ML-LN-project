They took out several boards with letters on them, and then walked up to the Harvard students and gave them the boards.</p><br/><p> \"Hello, we are members of the Harvard Pep Squad. We\u2019ll beat Columbia even at their home court. Just show the boards to Columbia during the match.\"</p><br/><p> \"We have printed letters on them. When you hold them up, the phrase \u2018Go Harvard\u2019 will be spelled! Isn't it a nice idea?\"</p><br/><p> Lowering his head, Qin Guan handed the boards to the Harvard men. He had been left speechless by John\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p> Thanks to the excitement and pride on his face, John convinced the spectators. The elite students accepted the plan without hesitation.</p><br/><p> All the boards were distributed. To avoid any questions and watch their plan being executed, Qin Guan and John sat by the Harvard men tamely.</p><br/><p> The whistle was heard, and the broadcast and commentary began. A wonderful match was about to start.</p><br/><p>Well, the word \"wonderful\" did not suit Columbia. In fact, the word \"disaster\" described their team better.</p><br/><p> \"The Harvard quarterback is wonderful!\"</p><br/><p> \"JC from Columbia rushed over... Wow, he fell down!\"</p><br/><p> \"Well done! Score for Harvard!\"</p><br/><p> \"Wow! It\u2019s our superstar Joseph! He runs as fast as a deer...\"</p><br/><p> \"Ah!\"</p><br/><p> Everyone held their breath. That must have hurt. Half of Joseph's body was pressed against the grass next to the player who played defence.</p><br/><p> \"Excellent! Keep him there!\" Several members of the Harvard team jumped on Joseph and pressed him down with their bodies.</p><br/><p> Joseph was crying in his hamlet. Bro, I will give you the ball. Just let me go! I\u2019m having trouble breathing! </p><br/><p> A fat man jumped on him and Joseph moaned. The ball in his hand finally rolled out through the pile of bodies.</p><br/><p> \"Wow! Harvard is not showing any sportsmanship. They got the ball by using a disgusting method!\"</p><br/><p> The overwhelming score made the Harvard students excited. Waving their flags around, they cheered loudly for their team.</p><br/><p> \"We should take action.\" John threw his disposable cup away and stood up. Patting the dust off his bottom, he walked up to the spectators.</p><br/><p> \"Listen to me, everyone! We are in a favorable position. it's time for us to beat Columbia. Come on! Let\u2019s cheer up our players! Follow my lead!\"</p><br/><p> He moved towards the exit, shouting, \"Audience sitting in F1 to 20, please hold up your boards and shout with me! Harvard!\"</p><br/><p> The atmosphere became animated. The Harvard students lifted the boards with a sense of purpose, shouting at the Columbia audience, \"Go Harvard!\"</p><br/><p> As expected, they attracted everyone\u2019s attention. From such a short distance, all the students were able to see their boards clearly. The photographer beside the court immediately turned his camera to the Harvard students.</p><br/><p> This was definitely breaking news. It would no doubt make Harvard a laughing stock among American universities.</p><br/><p> The words \"WE SUCK\" were spelled clearly on the boards.</p><br/><p> \"Ha ha ha...\" Everyone burst into laughter, both in and out of the court. The referee, broadcaster, assistants and staff couldn't carry on working.</p><br/><p> This would be the best prank of the year. Maybe even of all time.</p><br/><p> It would be an eternal joke! Some of the cheerleaders stopped dancing and fixed their eyes on the boards. After a long time, they came back to their senses, but they still couldn't continue their performance. They laughed until they started to tear up.</p><br/><p> By that time, the Harvard audience had finally realized that something was going on. Some of the students stood before the spectator seats and read the boards.</p><br/><p> \"F*ck! We were fooled by that son of a b*tch!\"</p><br/><p> The general enthusiasm reached its peak. Most football fans were young hot-blooded guys. Although they had graduated and become elites of society, their blood had not cooled down.</p><br/><p> \"Catch them!\"</p><br/><p> The people holding the boards rushed up to Qin Guan and Joseph right away.</p><br/><p> In all his life, Qin Guan had never experienced such a chilling winter wind. The silence was ringing in his ears, poetic and vacant.</p><br/><p> Of course, curses like \"stop, you son of a b*tch!\" broke the silence. As they ran, Qin Guan and John exchanged a knowing smile.</p><br/><p> \"Bro, you lied to me!\"</p><br/><p> \"God bless you, bro!\"</p><br/><p> On the crossroads, Qin Guan turned left, heading to the embrace of the noisy city. John turned right in the direction of the student shelter.</p><br/><p> Their long legs were an advantage, not just because they complemented their figure, but also because they helped them escape. One could take larger steps if they had longer legs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

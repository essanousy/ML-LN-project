During the shooting process, he found it difficult to express his pain.</p><br/><p> The music video had no plot. Qin Guan's role mainly involved interacting with Madonna, which made Qin Guan sigh in relief. Madonna was much better than Paris Hilton, who had shown him her boobs just like that.</p><br/><p>The director sat down behind the camera as Qin Guan sat in the rotating chair in the center of the studio. An assistant lit a slim white cigarette and handed it to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The lighting engineer turned off all the lights on the ceiling, leaving only those on the sides. Half of Qin Guan's body was in the dark. The light hit his long legs and the side of his face.</p><br/><p>Several beams of light and shadows were formed on his face, highlighting his straight nose. He looked like a dangerous man hiding in the dark. Every cell in his body was shouting in the darkness, but he still remained elegant.</p><br/><p>He was a mafia boss at the dawn of his life.</p><br/><p>An enthusiastic street girl in a colorful skirt entered his large office. She tried to flirt with the cool mafia boss by using her charm. There was background music playing during the scene. </p><br/><p>Madonna was a natural stage queen moving flexibly to the music. Suddenly, Cong Nianwei caught herself liking the hot singer.</p><br/><p>She danced enthusiastically around Qin Guan, radiating tenderness and love through her eyes. She looked like a moth darting towards the fire. If she failed, she would die.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan touched his chair with one of his feet. He didn\u2019t move or say anything, but there were flames dancing in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Smoke was rising from his fingers, yet he didn't move. Everyone could feel that he was obsessed with the girl, including the director and Britney, who was staring at Qin Guan like a drooling idiot.</p><br/><p>\"Acting in a music video is a waste of his abilities,\" the director told Britney.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the two actors strayed from the script. Madonna stopped dancing and took the cigarette from Qin Guan\u2019s mouth. As she smoked it, the cigarette burned brighter.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, it\u2019s not supposed to go like this. Never mind, it still looks good.\"</p><br/><p>Where are your principles, director?</p><br/><p>Qu nearly tore a poster into pieces, but Qin Guan\u2019s formal girlfriend was extremely calm. She didn\u2019t know this was a temporary performance. Sometimes, ignorance was bliss.</p><br/><p>As the shooting went on, there was a riot in Qin Guan's heart. His expression didn't change though.</p><br/><p>He pushed the woman in front of him away and stood up fiercely. The vintage silver watch chain swayed over his chest sexily.</p><br/><p>Then he was supposed to turn around and stride over to the couch, sit down and appreciate Madonna\u2019s dance from that comfortable position. It was a pity that Madonna did not follow the script. What she did next shocked everybody.</p><br/><p>Stopping Qin Guan with her hand, she wrapped her legs around his waist. She expected that, because of her weight, Qin Guan would have to sit back down on the chair so she could ride his body.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was no common man though.</p><br/><p>Despite the fierce attack of her 50 kilos, he didn\u2019t move or sit down.</p><br/><p>Madonna looked like a monkey hanging from a tree, trying to climb up the trunk.</p><br/><p>Standing still, Qin Guan looked at Madonna with a poker face. They were communicating with their eyes.</p><br/><p>Are you tired?</p><br/><p>Of course! Sit down!</p><br/><p>Never! My girlfriend is here. Don't mess with me...</p><br/><p>They looked at each other silently. Nobody tried to stop them. Everyone was too absorbed into the scene.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan cast a look at Cong Nianwei. His legs were shaking slightly as the annoying monkey on his body tried to beat him.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t rely on the director. I have to use my charm.</p><br/><p>He spoke to his girlfriend with his eyes. Come here.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei looked at him in confusion. Suddenly, Qin Guan nodded at her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

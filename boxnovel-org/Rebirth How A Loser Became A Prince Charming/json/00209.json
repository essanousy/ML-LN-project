Don\u2019t you remember \u2018Sunflower\u2019? Do you know his opinion of me?\"</p><br/><p>\"What opinion? I don't know.\" Sister Xue pretended to be ignorant.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan covered his forehead helplessly. \"He put his hands on my shoulders without a word, and after a long while, he said, \u2018It\u2019s a pity that you have no chance of cooperating with this generation of directors.\u2019\"</p><br/><p>\"Those were his exact words. Directors of his generation are either looking for good acting skills and hiring actors as extras, or focusing on reality and ordinary people. Those who engage in films like that are still struggling to find their way. According to Zhang Yang, I was gifted by the gods, but I have nothing in common with other actors.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huang Bo will be welcomed by that group. If you bring me though, I will hurt their confidence.\"</p><br/><p>Huang was listening to their conversation, taking pleasure in Qin Guan's misfortune. Despite his perfect looks, he\u2019s also been turned down. He felt quite comfortable.</p><br/><p>Then he realized what Qin Guan was saying. \"What are you talking about? I\u2019m also an actor. I am!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan told Huang seriously, \"You must go to that meeting. Gold always shines in the end. You will succeed one day.\"</p><br/><p>Huang was shocked by his words. They stared at each other with a meaningful expression before Sister Xue decided that both of them would go.</p><br/><p>It was slightly cold at night, and the industrial street by the 798 plant was shining in the white moonlight.</p><br/><p>Concrete, waste and machines parts were everywhere. Even the small stand that sold snacks at the end of the street couldn't warm the night.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan spit out the dust in his mouth. He walked to his secret base with some pot-stewed meat and beer in a plastic bag.</p><br/><p>There were some hungry friends there, waiting for him and the food.</p><br/><p>It was silent along the long, narrow path that led to the warehouse. Zhang Yuan headed directly for the only room with a light on.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the dazzling headlights of a car shined behind him. Scared and alert, he turned around and covered his eyes, trying to see the intruders clearly.</p><br/><p>The driver saw Zhang Yuan and turned off the engine politely. Sister Xue poked her head out and asked Zhang loudly, \"Is this warehouse 1122?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan nodded. Three people, a woman and two men, got out of the car.</p><br/><p>They walked up to Zhang, who was estimating the distance between him and the secret base. It was said that workers there had been mugged several times. It seemed that it was impossible to escape that fate.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan took a deep breath and decided to beg for his life. He was lost in thought, when he suddenly saw one of them more clearly.</p><br/><p>Silver moonlight was shining, forming a slender shadow behind Qin Guan. He looked like a fairy.</p><br/><p>As a director, Zhang Yuan had a romantic heart and boundless imagination. In 0.01 of a second, Zhang had convinced himself that Qin Guan was not human.</p><br/><p>\"Are you a ghost, a demon or an immortal?\"</p><br/><p>Huang immediately took over the conversation, trying to flatter Zhang, \"Directors are really different from ordinary people. Your greeting is very creative!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang coughed awkwardly to cover up his mistake. \"Are you Zhang Yang's friends? He told us that several partners would be coming over and he would introduce us to an actor. Follow me, we\u2019re all curious!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan came back to his senses and began to talk nonstop. \"F*ck! You convinced me. I originally thought Zhang Yang was messing with us. What's your name? Qin Guan? The same as the ancient grand secretary [2]? A good name indeed! You are really an exception among inferior actors.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was boasting silently.</p><br/><p>\"Before skilful actors can even show their talent, your face will attract all the attention. The audience will long for your presence.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why am I so excited though? Directors with good taste don't focus on box office success.\" He was chattering endlessly. His hungry brothers could hear his voice from afar.</p><br/><p>\"He must have met someone interesting.\"</p><br/><p>\"God! Give me some earplugs, or I\u2019ll go deaf tonight.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hush! Don\u2019t answer him. Quiet, they\u2019re coming!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they all fell silent around the tumbledown table, leaving the groggy yellow lamp above them on.</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open. Zhang Yuan put the beers and food on the table and drank some water from a porcelain jar.</p><br/><p>Then he gestured at Qin Guan and Huang Bo, introducing them, \"Hey! You should meet this guy. He is Qin Guan. Director Zhang often talks about him!\"</p><br/><p>He thought he was funny, but nobody answered him. They were all stunned by Qin Guan, who was standing under the dim 20-watt lamb.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang got a grip on himself and broke the silence first.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] The 798 plant used to be a state-run industrial plant.

She dedicated herself completely to this final chance.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was younger than her, but he was still someone she looked up to, so the main actors got to know each other fast.</p><br/><p>The early scenes were finished during the run-in process.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was right. Ang Lee was the most horrible perfectionist to ever exist. He paid attention to every detail. For example, when he shot Leehom Wang, who was walking down the stairs with Tang Wei feeling guilty, embarrassed and reluctant, he asked Wang to repeat that simple process 40 times! If one counted the breaks as well, it took the crew about four hours to film that scene!</p><br/><p>Maybe I will have to celebrate the Spring Festival here!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was right once again. While they were shut in the studio filming, the famous lawsuit against \"The Promise\" came to an end. The local government and the Yunnan village got compensated by Chen Hong. The producers, who received a severe warning from the related government department, had to publish a letter of apology and admit their mistake publicly, so that other people would cherish similar non-renewable resources in the future.</p><br/><p>When people thought too highly of themselves, they fell into a deep hole they could not get out of. Chen Kang had fought a good fight and returned proudly, while the film crew had been punished to warn others.</p><br/><p>Thus, the lawsuit became a part of the film's budget.</p><br/><p>This was just a trifle for Qin Guan though. His staff didn't inform him because he was going through a tough time with the crew at the time.</p><br/><p>Despite Ang Lee's strict requirements, which slowed the crew down, the shooting went on smoothly. During the earlier stages of the film, Tang Wei didn't share many scenes with Qin Guan. The film just focused on her sacrifice and her rough, childish plan. Although human life had been worthless during that era, this didn't mean that the value of a girl's virginity and the life of a puppet of the Japanese troops could be sacrificed for a righteous cause.</p><br/><p>When young people serviced their country, they lost their own personality in the process.</p><br/><p>Tang Wei was a poor girl who had lost her virginity in order to become an experienced woman and get a chance to assassinate Mr. Yi. However, the whole farce ended unceremoniously. Mr. Yi didn't even go into her house, because he had to leave for Shanghai immediately.</p><br/><p>A woman in their group home persuaded the girl to accept the cruel reality. She wanted to eliminated Wang's possible love for Tang Wei. The fat man was pathetic. He admired Tang secretly, so he didn't agree that she should have sex with that insignificant guy for such a meaningless purpose. In the end though, the coward just washed Tang's blood-stained sheets. He thought he was washing his own sins away by washing her dirty sheets.</p><br/><p>That insignificant guy was the worst. He just wanted to have sex with the beautiful girl as compensation for his money. The whole group lived on his financial support, and he had to drive the car around and run other errands for them.</p><br/><p>The most disgusting man among them was Leehom Wang, who had betrayed Wang for his own benefit. In his opinion, women had to sacrifice themselves for men's ambitions. Even the girl he loved was just a tool for him to use.</p><br/><p>Thus, after killing another so-called traitor, they all fled for their lives. Wang returned to Shanghai to let time cure her wounds.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, three years later, Leehom Wang threatened her and lured her to the boat of the Chongqing Party.</p><br/><p>They went on with the assassination in the name of justice.</p><br/><p>Wang and Tang had no idea that Qin Guan knew their real identities, so the first erotic scene between Qin Guan and Tang Wei was simple, yet cruel.</p><br/><p>While Tang was taking off her stockings, Qin Guan grabbed her hair from behind. He was not a gentleman anymore. He hit her head directly against the wall with a bang. Everyone felt sorry for the girl.</p><br/><p>Then, Qin Guan tore off her cheongsam. It was wonderful!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His well-built back looked very alluring as crystal beads of sweat appeared on his smooth forehead.</p><br/><p>His agile jump looked like a standard gymnastics exercise as he climbed over the wall. When he landed on the ground on the other side of the wall, Qin Guan opened his arms for Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>\"Jump, Wei!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei jumped off without hesitation with a naughty smile. She was excited to get out of line for once. The two of them suddenly heard a roar from the other side.</p><br/><p>\"Did Qin Guan climb over the wall?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I saw him! It looked bloody awesome!\"</p><br/><p>\"Come on! Follow him!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan jumped on his bike. Fortunately, it was still intact.</p><br/><p>\"The bear!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei pulled the bear down from the wall. The people on the other side saw its short legs disappear off the top of the wall. They climbed up, only to see the couple ride away in the distance.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A boy jumped off and then raised his arms at the crowd in disappointment.</p><br/><p>\"They are gone!\" the others cried out angrily.</p><br/><p>The bike rushed out of the alley and joined the traffic on South Avenue. They had finally escaped successfully.</p><br/><p>The stars were sparkling in the sky, as all the clouds had hidden away in the cold winter night.</p><br/><p>The scattered sounds of fireworks announced the arrival of the Spring Festival.</p><br/><p>Let's celebrate the Spring Festival! Let's celebrate the Spring Festival!</p><br/><p>During the Spring Festival, people always complained about being bored. They had no idea how to spend the long holiday. They always sneered at the old-fashioned Spring Festival Gala, but they still looked forward to the gala chimes at midnight.</p><br/><p>Peanuts, sunflower seeds, fruit drops... New Year phone calls, kowtowing, unexpected money...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's phone was silent. No one knew that he had returned to China except for the people that were close to him. Qin Guan was eating sunflower seeds as he waited for Zhou Jing and Li Jian, when he suddenly received a call from Xue Wanyi.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Sister Xue. I think we have already exchanged a New Year's call.\"</p><br/><p>\"We have work to do. I got a call from Huayi yesterday. They want to offer you a film role.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm busy enjoying the Spring Festival.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's after the Lantern Festival. I read the script and thought it was really good. I'll say yes for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are breaking the rules, sister.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qu is of the same opinion. I just sent the script to Cong Nianwei's email. Wait for the shooting schedule, okay?\"</p><br/><p>You got my girlfriend involved?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got a message from Cong Nianwei on his phone. The script is not bad. I sent it to your email address.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was right. But so what? His priority was to enjoy the holiday with his friends.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan threw the phone onto the couch impatiently. Maybe I could take a look at the script first\u2026 I have nothing to do now anyway.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned on his laptop and checked his email for the script.</p><br/><p>It was titled \"Perhaps, Love.\" What the hell is it about? Does it revolve around an aggressive CEO or a wild concubine?</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan read it nervously, he became stricter. When he reached the end of the script, he called Sister Xue back.</p><br/><p>\"Which role is mine, Sister Xue?\"</p><br/><p>\"The love interest, of course. The producer saved the role for you. If you turn it down, they'll offer it to Jincheng Wu...\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll do it, but after the Lantern Festival.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem. So, shall I pass on your response?\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. I'll be waiting for the schedule.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hung up, smiling to himself. This was the second time he was seizing an opportunity from Jincheng Wu. Sorry, but we are competitors!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Open the door! We are here!\"</p><br/><p>He saw smiles form on the fat and thin faces outside the door. His friends had been working, but their hugs remained just as tight.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Let me go! I can't breathe!\"</p><br/><p>He would be the first man to get smothered against another man's chest.</p><br/><p>\"You should lose some weight, Li JIan. I mean it!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan broke away from his embrace and started putting on his clothes. \"Let's go! Where are we going today? Is it still a secret?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about their destination for the Spring Festival. He only realized what their general direction was when they got into Li Jian's new Santana.</p><br/><p>They drove along South Avenue, heading west. There were only plants and vegetable fields in that direction. Where were they going?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

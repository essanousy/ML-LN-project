We are coming!\"</p><br/><p>The girls rushed over to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had just broken out of the ring of reporters. Before he could let out a sigh of relief, he heard a roar behind him.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>The roar sounded desperate. Qin Guan turned around with a professional smile and faced an astonishing spectacle.</p><br/><p>Two female actresses in black and white dresses were supporting a man between them. The man seemed like the most normal person among them. The two girls looked flushed in the cold wind. Their hair floated like a cloud behind them as a disgusting bubble of snot formed on the man's nostril.</p><br/><p>They were moving at lightning speed. When Qin Guan stopped walking, even the angry director grew excited. What a good opportunity!</p><br/><p>A cold light flashed across Director Kim's eyes. Taking advantage of their momentum, he rushed over to Qin Guan and embraced him. The two of them stood together shoulder to shoulder. Meanwhile, the cunning girls came to stand on both sides of Qin Guan, locking his arms in place.</p><br/><p>The reporters went crazy again. A battle began as they pointed their cameras at them.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! Director Kim and Qin Guan are acquainted! This is striking news! It will make the headlines!\"</p><br/><p>The entertainment reporters from SBS were crying, while the representatives of the leading Korean fashion magazines \"Cindy\" and \"Ceci\" were hugging each other excitedly.</p><br/><p>It's the Berlin Festival Best Actor Award Winner! He's the favorite of the organizing committee! If Director Kim knows him, does this mean that he will win an award during this festival?</p><br/><p>No one really cared about the Koreans' short stay on the carpet. They only cared about taking good pictures.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's schedule was delayed for a few minutes. Despite the three Koreans hanging on to his body for dear life though, he still managed to look perfect until he reached the other end of the carpet.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue gazed at the four of them coldly, with her arms folded across her chest. Unable to withstand her stare, the three shameless Koreans let Qin Guan go. Sister Xue pulled him to the backstage area.</p><br/><p>\"Don't show kindness to everyone, Qin Guan! Maybe they were competing with you over who would make tomorrow's headlines!\" Sister Xue lowered her voice cautiously.</p><br/><p>If Director Kim, who was a renowned man in his own country, heard her comment, he would be quite offended.</p><br/><p>The old directors patted Qin Guan on the shoulder happily. They were planning on having a drink in a small pub nearby. All Qin Guan had to do was show up at the award ceremony on time.</p><br/><p>As he waited silently in his room, he recalled the other nominees of the 54th Ceremony. He had a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>The winter in Berlin was much colder. When night fell, Qin Guan put on his black formal outfit.</p><br/><p>All the lamps in the hall were lit. Another fierce battle was about to begin.</p><br/><p>The host on the stage opened the envelopes in his hands one by one and handed the awards to the winners.</p><br/><p>As usual, the most important award would be announced last. Qin Guan was sitting steadily, affecting everyone around him. All he could do now was rely on his luck.</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the hall as the audience listened to the host carefully.</p><br/><p>\"The winner of the Outstanding Artistic Contribution Award is... 'Dawn'!\"</p><br/><p>Director Luchan grew nervous. The next award would be the Best Actor. All the cameras focused on Qin Guan. If he was not the winner, it would be really sad news.</p><br/><p>The host, who was a playful man, opened the envelope slowly with trembling hands.</p><br/><p>The audience grew more and more nervous as he drawled, \"The winner of the Best Actor Award of the 54th Ceremony is...\"</p><br/><p>All the lights fixed on the only Chinese person in the room, Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! With the film 'Lost Embrace'!\"</p><br/><p>A deafening applause echoed around the hall. The Silver Bear seemed to be waving at Qin Guan as he walked to the stage slowly. He always remained indifferent to both admiration and humiliation. He hugged the host and took the bear and the microphone from him.</p><br/><p>Then he turned around with the award, put the microphone against his lips and began delivering his second speech at the Berlin Film Festival.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She bent forward from the shadows.</p><br/><p>Her fair skin looked transparent under the light. Her long earrings were hanging on her shoulders, swaying back and forth.</p><br/><p>Her lips opened slightly. Her sweet lippie looked sticky as she opened her mouth. A low, sexy voice came out of her throat. \"Just call me Olivia!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that the character from the \u2018King's Night\u2019?\" Qin Guan was confused.</p><br/><p>\"Exactly, Chuck. You surprise me. You are not like those other assassins,\" she said before she left the quiet booth with her handbag without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Her white long boots wrapped around her slender legs. Her black fur coat was like a black river flowing around her body. She was a complete temptation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan craned his head to see her back view as she walked down the end of the corridor.</p><br/><p>At the end of the scene, Director George said, \"Cut!\" His voice broke the silence. The whole crew let out a long breath. Shooting at night was the most annoying. Any small mistake could be expanded and everyone was inclined to get bored and angry.</p><br/><p>George had chosen that short scene as a trial for Qin Guan and Julia, so they could get to their exciting erotic scene as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>The stylist went up to Qin Guan fast. She was eager to get some sleep after the scene.</p><br/><p>She was working on Qin Guan's curly hair, when Julia went back for a new costume, smiling brightly to warm up the winter night. She put her hand on Qin Guan's hair naughtily and pulled...</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\" Qin Guan screamed out.</p><br/><p>What are you doing, elder sister?</p><br/><p>Julia\u2019s symbolic wide mouth formed an \"O\". She didn't stop though.</p><br/><p>She wrapped a lock around her finger and then let it go. The lock was sticking out of Qin Guan\u2019s hair now.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! it's real hair. It\u2019s so elastic!\"</p><br/><p>So you just wanted to test my hair? That's why people call you silly!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless. Julia seemed to be still interested in his hair though. That Asian boy was so cute! In her opinion, he had to have a sensitive heart under that perfect face, just like she did.</p><br/><p>Before she could make another attempt, George shouted at the crew.</p><br/><p>\"Get ready, everyone! This is the last scene for tonight.\"</p><br/><p>The crew put down their glasses. Qin Guan and Julia sat down by the table, leaning their heads slightly towards the camera and the director.</p><br/><p>\"Three, two, camera!\" The funniest scene was about to begin.</p><br/><p>Julia smiled in her black evening dress with her typical indifference and charm. Her V-neck dress was very revealing.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you here tonight?\" Qin Guan placed his arm on the dining table. His voice was very seductive.</p><br/><p>A fire was burning in the fireplace. It was the only source of light in the room.</p><br/><p>Julia lowered her eyes, and then looked up again. \"I don\u2019t know. Your charm is remarkable.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a sip of the transparent drink in his glass, slowly shaking the leftover wine. His gaze was deep and dangerous.</p><br/><p>The cameras zoomed forward. No background was visible through the lens. Only their features and the white candlesticks were visible in the dark.</p><br/><p>They looked at each other, communicating through their eyes. Julia felt dizzy by Qin Guan's charm.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she moved. Using her full strength, she pushed all the tableware to the floor.</p><br/><p>Crack! The smashing sound was savage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan moved too. Her identity was not important. He just acted on his desire. He strode onto the table like a beast catching its prey and bent forward to touch Julia\u2019s face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He just kept pushing the camera forward to capture the perfect scene. It was a wonderful combination of emotion and reality.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's handsome looks, calm expression and smooth handwriting made him look very graceful. Suddenly, the handsome man started murmuring to himself.</p><br/><p>The scene must be coming to an end. I'm so tired of raising my wrist to write. How long has it been now? Ten minutes? Fifteen? There is no spare space left on the bamboo slips. Shall I keep writing?</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan's hands began to shake, Director Zhang stopped the camera.</p><br/><p>\"Well done, Qin Guan! Stay here. I have some good news for you.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan agreed before he ran back to Sister Xue, who gave him a windcoat to put on.</p><br/><p>Don't get sick, my boy. You have so much work during the next few days.</p><br/><p>What a considerate agent!</p><br/><p>Shocked by Qin Guan's acting skills, the other actors started clapping. In their opinion, he was the hope of modern Chinese cinema. Although they were not insiders of the film circle, they had reached the consensus that the Chinese film industry would flourish if all actors were as capable as Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Grandpa Qian was walked to the set by Zhang Yimou. He would be carving a jade imperial seal that reflected the theme of the documentary.</p><br/><p>Grandpa Qian was a master in his field. He got all his materials and tools ready and then got to work. Director Zhang sat behind the camera silently. So did Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He envied the man's skill.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan memorized his carving method, the way he used his tools and the final composition with his eyes and brain. Professional skills were always important.</p><br/><p>In a few minutes, Grandpa Qian had created a figure that was running with open arms. The figure was running and dancing as a way to welcome victory. It looked like the traditional Chinese character \"\" [1].</p><br/><p>It was an artistic crystallization. The old man blew the debris away gently to reveal the final pattern. The stamp was visible clearly on the camera.</p><br/><p>Qian pressed it into a red inkpad and then stamped it on a piece of white paper to form the logo of the 2008 Olympics. That simple but meaningful stamp was the protagonist of the documentary.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was aware that they had finished the most essential part of the film. After the break, they would head to another location. The staff packed up all the equipment and props. Most people left, as their job had been finished.</p><br/><p>Another group of people arrived and headed to the temporary office with Qin Guan. He and Sister Xue didn't come back to their senses until they sat in the office, which used to be a park lounge.</p><br/><p>They were not surprised to see Lu Chuan there, but the other two men seemed to be from the Huayi Brothers Media Group.</p><br/><p>Besides, why was Feng Xiaogang there?</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qin Guan, who were both cautious by nature, remained quiet. They looked down, waiting for those strange guys to speak first.</p><br/><p>Lu Chuan was the one to break the silence.</p><br/><p>\"We just scared him, Qin Guan. Don't worry, it's no big deal.\"</p><br/><p>Then he winked and made a shameless gesture of prayer.</p><br/><p>\"Please shoot a film with me, Qin Guan! Please!\"</p><br/><p>Both Qin Guan and Sister Xue let out a breath of relief, but Qin Guan was still looking at the men doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\"A film about what?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ke Ke Ci Li.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha... Shall we go to Qinghai?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\"</p><br/><p>\"The location is okay. Is there anything you are hiding from me?\"</p><br/><p>\"The film is about wild animal protection. It will be a record of actual events, so it may influence your career as a model.\"</p><br/><p>That explains the strange atmosphere. They are treating me as a top model first.</p><br/><p>[1] It means \u201ccapital\u201d.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

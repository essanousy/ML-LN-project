That was not the worst thing that could happen. The worst thing was going to your first ever audition for a magazine, a magazine that was way too popular for you to say no, and meeting your arch enemy on the site.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Shao Xiaobing met at ELLE\u2019s studio. If it wasn\u2019t for that meeting, Qin Guan would never have heard any news about that hypocrite again.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s status in the circle had been gradually upgraded though, so he would inevitably meet Shao at a fashion show at some point.</p><br/><p>Ever since Shao's conspiracy had been discovered by New Silk Road, Qin Guan didn't think he would influence his life anymore.</p><br/><p>Without jobs from the company, brand businessmen would contact him directly. Besides, Sister Xue was good at public relations.</p><br/><p>The countless trouble Shao caused him was like an annoying fly though.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, their status in the modelling circle was equal. Shao had been struggling in the field since he was 14 years old though, so he had more contacts than Qin Guan. He could cause him lots of trouble if he wanted.</p><br/><p>It was unpleasant to have such a narrow-minded rival. Shao used to call all the models he knew to isolate him, or delay his measurements. Sometimes, he even collided with Qin Guan secretly before a show. Qin Guan was a tough man, so could bear all those tricks. The only thing he couldn\u2019t bear was Shao's slander.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no wild ambitions, but he still had some ideals.</p><br/><p>He could sell Spring Festival scrolls in the chilly winter and kebabs in the hot summer. He could also sell women\u2019s swimsuits.</p><br/><p>He had given up his carefree college life for his modelling career while he was still in the prime time of his youth. He had been trained by the best domestic tutors, and tolerated their rebuke and punishments.</p><br/><p>He had learned about dancing, traditional Chinese formalities, classical Western formalities, musical instruments, calligraphy, chess, even martial arts. He had worked with different groups, such as printed media, advertising companies, and film and TV productions.</p><br/><p>He had practiced a basic gesture repeatedly in an empty room in the deep night. He had read lines again and again in his bed to learn from other actors.</p><br/><p>Although he had been gifted with an extraordinary memory, he knew what the real meaning of his rebirth was and had worked hard to learn.</p><br/><p>By then, everyone was saying what a lucky boy he was. No one paid attention to his secret endeavours.</p><br/><p>During the audition, Qin Guan finally exploded.</p><br/><p>He had a casual chat with Shao, but he couldn't stand the guy\u2019s malevolence anymore.</p><br/><p>They would settle this once and for all in the empty waiting room.</p><br/><p>Shao was sitting on the couch with his eyes closed. He kept sneering at Qin Guan, until Qin Guan pulled him up by his collar and pushed him against the wall.</p><br/><p>It was the first time they were looking at each other from such a close distance.</p><br/><p>After a slight confusion, Shao came back to his senses.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? You want to beat me? I\u2019ve ashamed you into anger, huh?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at him with the most sincere expression, delivering every single word clearly, \"I don't know the reason behind your conspiracy, but I know I\u2019m not the troublemaker here. I just wanted to tell you that you have wronged me!\"</p><br/><p>Shao stared at Qin Guan's eyes. He noticed that the young man had a pair of transparent, clean eyes with dark, mysterious pupils that hypnotized anyone who looked at them.</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing realized the truth he had been ignoring. Qin Guan couldn't be suppressed by a single person or a company.</p><br/><p>His looks were the reason for his success, and Shao was clear on the fact that, as long as Qin Guan existed, he would never reach the top.</p><br/><p>He smiled bitterly at the thought.</p><br/><p>\"Is there anything wrong with my disapproval? I just don\u2019t like your extraordinary looks and nonchalant attitude.\"</p><br/><p>Envy flashed across Shao's eyes. \"There are so many models striving for years to participate in a show, and you turn down shows because the date doesn\u2019t suit you. There are so many models who want a place in the circle and a formal contract, so many models fighting to make ends meet\u2026 Some models can't even pay their rent!\"</p><br/><p>\"Some lucky guys earn 5,000 to 8,000 yuan a month, while others earn that much in a year. What do you want to say to them? Why is this so unfair? You and your perfect looks! We have to kneel down to worship you! We can't blame god because he didn't give us better looks!\"</p><br/><p>Shao was getting more and more agitated as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled gently. \"You are jealous of me!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

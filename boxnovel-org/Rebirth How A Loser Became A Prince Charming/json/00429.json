It's Qin Guan! He\u2019s with Director Zhang!\" the reporter murmured to himself as he looked at their backs. Another photographer, who had heard his words, craned his neck around.</p><br/><p>\"Dude, do you know that actor?\"</p><br/><p>The reporter began to introduce his compatriot proudly.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, he is one of the most famous top models in China. He has also acted in several good TV shows. His audience ratings were unparalleled...\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" The foreign reporter was surprised. The Chinese reporter had described Qin Guan like a superstar in China.</p><br/><p>\"Great!\" The foreign reporter gave a thumbs-up to the reporter from Xinlang, who held his head high proudly. I may have added some things, but most of the things I told him were true.</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan and Zhang Yimou had reached the background board and signed it.</p><br/><p>\"This way, please.\" A security guard in a grey suit opened the gate at the end of the carpet for them. The stars could enter the guest area through that gate.</p><br/><p>There was a curtain hanging before the entrance of the theater. Several iron rods were holding up a temporary ceiling, blocking the sunlight. Celebrities in expensive clothes were chatting in the small area.</p><br/><p>There was also a big board, where the official Oscar media representatives were gathered. Only TV stations authorised with independent rebroadcasting rights were qualified to set up their cameras there.</p><br/><p>The staff was still playing a game of running and chasing. They walked among the crowd, occasionally getting hold of some stars or celebrities.</p><br/><p>Some famous directors had failed to escape and were standing in front of the tall golden figure, taking pictures for the press.</p><br/><p>Following the guidance of the staff, Qin Guan and Director Zhang also stood by the splendid golden figure, which was about two meters tall. It was the first time Qin Guan felt the desire to take out his cell phone and take a picture.</p><br/><p>Although he preferred indie films to commercial films, he was shocked by the atmosphere there. This was the capital of the film industry all over the world after all.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he hadn\u2019t taken his cell phone with him. Sister Xue was standing behind the ropes. One day I, Qin Guan, will take pictures here with the golden statue! I will not be a guest, but a winner!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's ambition couldn't be concealed from Zhang, who also wanted desperately to win an Oscar.</p><br/><p>After taking some photos, they retreated to the edge of the red carpet. They exchanged a glance with each other and cast a meaningful look at the golden statue.</p><br/><p>Under the light of the setting sun, the guests entered the hall with their invitations.</p><br/><p>The stage was decorated in baby blue and crystals, which made a sharp contrast with the red chairs and carpet under the stage.</p><br/><p>When the audience was seated, Steve Martin, the host of the ceremony, mounted the stage with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\"Before the grand award ceremony, all the actors and reporters should deliver a speech about the wrongful war. It is with heavy hearts that we have gathered here today for this award ceremony. It was not long ago that the war in Iraq broke out.\"</p><br/><p>He was right. At previous ceremonies, actresses had dressed up like peacocks. That day though, all the ladies were dressed in black or white. No one had dared wear jewellery. Thanks to Steve's humor, everyone eventually felt comfortable.</p><br/><p>The first award winner was announced. The musical \"Chicago\" had beaten \"Gangs of New York\", \"The Lord of the Rings II\" and \"The Pianist\" and won the Oscar for Best Film.</p><br/><p>The executive director of Miramax, an old man with grey hair, was smiling so happily that the wrinkles on his face seemed to form a flower.</p><br/><p>Adrien Brody, the leading actor of \"The Pianist\" won the award for Best Actor. Holding the golden statue, he burst into tears on the stage.</p><br/><p>The cameraman zoomed in on another nominee for the award. Nicholas Cage was smiling calmly. Even Qin Guan though, who was sitting in the back of the hall, could feel his disappointment.</p><br/><p>As a skilled actor, an Oscar was his lifelong dream. It was also the dream of thousands of actors in the US. That small golden statue was their only aim. There were so many factors involved though, including the script, the director, the producer, the distributing company, the audience, the national policy, and so on. Of course, luck was the most important factor.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan slowly let out a long breath. Suddenly, he saw Catherine Zeta-Jones walk on the stage.</p><br/><p>The British woman, who had been criticized for using her body to her advantage, had finally received an acknowledgement of her talent. She hugged her husband excitedly as she accepted the award. Steve made a joke about feeling jealous.</p><br/><p>\"Film stars play all kinds of roles. I appreciate them, worship them, but also feel dissatisfied with them. For example, some of them only cooperate with their wives!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

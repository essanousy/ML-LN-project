They were professionals of the entertainment circle, none of whom signed in regular script.</p><br/><p>They were a little confused when he asked them for a signature, as Qin Guan was just as famous as they were at the time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn\u2019t tell them that he had come from the future though. No one would believe that.</p><br/><p>Time was of the greatest importance for junior students, not just because of their heavy schoolwork, but also because they had just begun to think about their future. There were various choices they had to make.</p><br/><p>Because of her outstanding design inspiration and solid training, Cong Nianwei's tutor had asked her to design some large-scale buildings during her sophomore year. Although it was just basic design, her tutor could see her potential.</p><br/><p>To be honest, QH University had the best Architecture Department in China, but there were different building styles in different countries. As a student majoring in Architecture, open horizons and rich experiences would inspire Cong Nianwei a lot. Her tutor suggested that she take graduate lessons abroad.</p><br/><p>He recommended that Cong Nianwei select some foreign universities to pursue further studies. Once she made her decision though, she had to start preparing.</p><br/><p>After hesitating for a long time, Cong Nianwei finally called Qin Guan to share that option with him.</p><br/><p>The news stupefied Qin Guan. He would have to pay more attention to his tutor\u2019s suggestions to study abroad now.</p><br/><p>By his nature, Qin Guan had no inclination towards making progress. He already had a wonderful plan for his future. First, he would get his CPA certificate before graduation, and then he would open an accounting firm with the money he had earned from his part-time job. He would be able to provide financial support to Cong Nianwei so she could continue her studies as long as she liked.</p><br/><p>Wherever water flowed, a channel was formed. He would make the perfect proposal at the peak of their love. That was how fairytales always ended. The prince and the princess lived happily ever after.</p><br/><p>What's going on now? This means that we\u2019ll part ways as soon as we graduate. Then what? What shouId I do? Wait for my girlfriend at home? No! No! How can I continue living the fairytale alone? This won\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had two choices.</p><br/><p>The first one was to stay at home, chat with other friends, and run a poor firm. Occasionally, Sister Xue would book some shows for him. At night, when everything was still, he would cry himself to sleep under his quilt.</p><br/><p>His second choice was to go abroad with her. Students were crazy about going abroad.</p><br/><p>Between 2004 and 2006, it was a busy period for returning scholars, who finished their studies overseas and came back. By that time, the inland was thirsty and scholars were at their peak. Qin Guan\u2019s starting point might even be higher than that.</p><br/><p>After clearing the situation, Qin Guan called Cong Nianwei back at midnight.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had fallen asleep by then. \"It\u2019s too late,\" she murmured in a low voice. \"I haven't even made a decision!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s anxiety made her feel warm. She turned over before she added, \"If you don't want me to leave, I\u2019ll think about it again. It's only an option after all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Actually, I\u2019ll be back in two years, which is not a very long time. Women hold lower positions in the architectural industry. Without enough qualifications and experience, it'll be hard for me to exert my abilities.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? No, I haven\u2019t decided which university to apply for. There are several colleges with good Architecture Departments. QH will give me a chance for individual promotion. Which country? My tutor has suggested the US.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was clear on her thoughts now, which cheered him up. The US is a modern country. Maybe then she will want to\u2026 Ha ha\u2026</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, he tried to calm down and continue the conversation. \"I have already made my decision. It's better to see the world while we\u2019re still young. Fill in your application, and then we can take the TOEFL, IELTS, or GRE. Any one is fine. Let's go together.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was surprised. She thought they had been talking about their future plans. How had they decided to study abroad together? Qin Guan's decision made her nervousness disappear though.</p><br/><p>If she went with him, her days overseas wouldn't be as hard as she imagined.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Qin Guan turned the matter over in his mind as he lay on his bed. He had to work more. Maybe he could accept one of those ridiculous plays.</p><br/><p>It was a sudden decision. If he could make money himself, he could stop asking financial support from his parents. The expenses overseas would be high though. It seemed like he\u2019d have to fight for his and Cong Nianwei\u2019s future.</p><br/><p>Oh, by the way, I should send an email to John. He might help us do some things in advance, such as gather the right paperwork or rent an apartment. He might even help me find a job in the US.</p><br/><p>As he thought of this, Qin Guan's sleepiness evaporated. He got up and turned on his computer. When he finished his email, he stared at the date on the screen, lost in thought.</p><br/><p>Our way to the US might be not smooth. It's 2001. In a few months, there will be a terrible incident in the US that will shock the whole world. Maybe I don't need to worry about the future though. God will take care of everything.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan thought about his plan overnight and went to class with black circles under his eyes. There were so many things he had to do.</p><br/><p>First, he would have to have a talk with his tutor, who liked him the most, and learn from his experience. Second, he would need to talk to Sister Xue and inform her that he would fail to keep up their arrangement. Third, he would have to inform his parents, Professor Li, Teacher Rong, his best friends, and his roommates.</p><br/><p>Then he would have to find some learning material about studying abroad, which might help him get a scholarship from a foreign university. The final thing on his list was the simplest one: find work.</p><br/><p>.....</p><br/><p>Qin Guan started right away. Sister Xue found it strange that he read all the scripts, which he usually didn\u2019t pay any attention to.</p><br/><p>She wanted to commit suicide when she found out about his decision. She had worked very hard to get him where he was. In two more years, he would soar to the sky, yet he wanted to go overseas!</p><br/><p>Sister Xue called Professor Li immediately. \"Professor Li, where are you? Help me!\"</p><br/><p>Professor Li was over the moon though. She couldn\u2019t predict the future in the domestic modelling circle, but rather than accumulate working experience at home and upgrade his level by acting in TV shows, she would rather that Qin Guan starred on the international stage.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

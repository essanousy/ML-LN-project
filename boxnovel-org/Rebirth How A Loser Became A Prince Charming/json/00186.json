There was no other man around. Therefore, he was really happy when he saw the actor who would play Jia Lian that day.</p><br/><p>He was stunned when Qin Guan walked out of the dressing room with a high bun and a green gown though. Oh, my! That man is way more beautiful than those chattering girls!</p><br/><p>Huang Bo lost his head. I\u2019m not good at getting along with elegant people, and that guy looks like a nobleman. He will ignore me if I greet him.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan had rolled up his long sleeves and walked up to Huang, hugging him around the shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"Huang Bo? Are you the actor who will play Xingr? I\u2019m Qin Guan, and I\u2019ll play Jia Lian. We\u2019ll become good friends. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Same here, same here.\" Huang gave him his symbolic silly smile. He looked confused.</p><br/><p>Good lenses, but bad frames. He\u2019s a bold guy. I like him.</p><br/><p>They had gotten close from their first meeting. In 10 minutes, they were already familiar with each other.</p><br/><p>As an elder brother, Huang thought he had the responsibility to tell Qin Guan about the crew.</p><br/><p>\"We wonder if the producer wants to promote a certain actress. It might be Yuanyang. Pingr is impossible. She is such an ugly girl. Don't provoke those girls. One of them could be the producer\u2019s lover. Stay with me, I\u2019ll protect you.\"</p><br/><p>Protect him from what? From the girls?</p><br/><p>Before Huang could finish his speech, the girl named Ningr came over to greet Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"So you\u2019re the actor who will play Second Master Lian? Why don't you introduce yourself to us?\" she said, pointing to the group of actresses.</p><br/><p>The girls were looking at Qin Guan. They all pushed up their breasts and fixed their hair, trying to impress the handsome guy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan dared not go. He had to fabricate an excuse to escape.</p><br/><p>What will I do later in the studio?</p><br/><p>The director was not interested in Qin Guan's feelings. The first scene began soon.</p><br/><p>In a show full of women, Qin Guan's part was not that big. In the first scene, he committed adultery with Ningr, his wife\u2019s servant. Unfortunately, he was caught by Wang.</p><br/><p>Jia Lian was quite a mighty man! He even debated putting on his clothes again.</p><br/><p>It was a perfect scene. The director stopped three times, because Ningr was staring at Qin Guan's chest. Wang Xifeng also forgot her lines five times, because she was staring at his face. Generally speaking, the two-minute scene was a f*cking success!</p><br/><p>Exhausted, Qin Guan walked out of the studio. Huang Bo tried his best to suppress his laughter. His small charming eyes seemed to be gloating.</p><br/><p>To Qin Guan's disappointment, Huang was too young at the time to have his symbolic wrinkles.</p><br/><p>Staring at Huang and Yuanyang before the camera, Qin Guan sighed with emotion. The superstar is still a nobody. He can only play a manservant.</p><br/><p>He had a long way to go before he became successful. Those roles were insignificant, but his hard work would lead to success.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to Earth and saw Huang finish his scene smoothly. Then the two of them got together again and began to criticize the scriptwriter. With some beer and cold dishes, they could talk about that awful script for a whole day.</p><br/><p>\"After the birth of her daughter, her tripe became a rock!\" [1]</p><br/><p>\"She deserves it. As servant girls, we have to fight for our destiny.\"</p><br/><p>The two guys were left speechless by the lines. They laughed so hard that they started feeling dizzy.</p><br/><p>Then it was time for Qin Guan's next scene. He had to put on a cloak weaved by black and white yarn.</p><br/><p>\"Pingr has my son? Pingr has my son? I had no idea! How?\"</p><br/><p>The director made a grimace full of anxiousness and excitement.</p><br/><p>\"Pingr has my son?\" Huang fell on the ground and rolled around in laughter. What funny lines! Is that your father's son? What a tragedy!</p><br/><p>\"Madam and Master promised me that I could marry anyone I like.\" Those lines must have been written by a group of illiterates. You could get a concubine, but never marry her!</p><br/><p>\"Wang Xifeng! You always bully me, but you have to obey me now!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s character seemed like a coward who was only strong on the outside. His voice was shaking as he recited his lines.</p><br/><p>His secret of success was imagining that Cong Nianwei had discovered his own adultery. Wang Xifeng was nothing but a firecracker, but Cong Nianwei was a canon!</p><br/><p>He had never experienced the anger of that calm girl.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could not help but shiver at the thought.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha!\" Huang Bo fell off his seat from laughing too hard. He\u2019s so talented! How can he be this good when he\u2019s so young? A man cannot be judged by his looks.</p><br/><p>The director looked at Huang speechlessly. He also hated that terrible show, but he had to carry on. He was under great pressure. Nobody knew his pain.</p><br/><p>Are you the troublemaker? You\u2019re lucky the final shot was finished, or I\u2019d kill you!</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] It indicates infertility.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He took a deep breath. This sure will be hard work.</p><br/><p>With excellent quality and a reasonable price, the 56-page album would cost 35 yuan.</p><br/><p>This meant that Qin Guan would have to finish the photoshoot before the release date of all the magazines.</p><br/><p>All the photos would be checked by a professional group with a magnifying glass.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the Citizen watch Qin Guan would represent was a classical watch among mechanical ones. The branding business thought that his personality matched the watch perfectly. The watch symbolized independence, self-confidence and a low profile.</p><br/><p>The album told the story of a man in an ice-cold metallic city, who had just started his own business. In the deep night, he worked at his desk alone, neon lights shining outside the window.</p><br/><p>When he made some achievements at work, he was suddenly surrounded by applause. Tired but satisfied, he was waiting for the last subway home. The dim back view of the lonely man expressed the loneliness of a stranger in a metropolis.</p><br/><p>His heart palpitated with excitement when he came across a girl. The girl was Qin Guan\u2019s partner. As the female ambassador of Citizen, she had arrived in the capital that day.</p><br/><p>The Japanese director nearly pulled his hair out for choosing a film actress to cooperate with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>After careful consideration, they finally chose Fukada Ky\u014dko to be the ambassador of the new ladies\u2019 watch.</p><br/><p>They met outside the Citizen headquarters for the first time and were quickly followed by countless journalists. Lights were flashing everywhere. Everyone was filled with curiosity about the controversial star.</p><br/><p>The staff stopped the journalists and led the two actors into the shooting studio.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Fukada Ky\u014dko were looking at each other from head to toe. With her pure beautiful face and excellent figure, the girl had quickly become popular in Japan. She had impressed Qin Guan a lot.</p><br/><p>As a tough man, Qin Guan never watched Japanese TV series, but she was renowned, not just for her face or figure, but for her romantic interests too. She was known as the Stamp-Collecting Queen [1].</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the girl, who was only a little younger than him. Who could imagine that she\u2019d had a three-way romance?</p><br/><p>Her ex-boyfriends included Takizawa Hideaki, Noriyuki Higashiyama (their relationship had lasted for only one year), and the hot scriptwriter Shinji Nojima (who had been the third party).</p><br/><p>The hot actress, who had made her debut two years earlier, had already begun collecting handsome boys.</p><br/><p>The staff made a short introduction. Kyoko Fukada bowed before Qin Guan politely and then followed her assistant to the dressing room.</p><br/><p>Looking at her back, Qin Guan touched his jaw. He would need a translator while he worked with the Japanese girl. He believed it was necessary to handle several foreign languages considering that he would have to work with a foreign brand.</p><br/><p>Several days earlier, he had begun to study Japanese. He had even audited some Japanese classes at the training school and had mastered the basics of Japanese dialogue.</p><br/><p>There would be some unique words during the shooting though. To avoid a misunderstanding, Qin Guan had relied on a translator during the negotiation.</p><br/><p>Kyoko entered her dressing room and gave up her cute girl act. She sat in a chair, folding her legs up.</p><br/><p>The dresser got to work while she shared her opinion on Qin Guan with her assistant.</p><br/><p>\"My Chinese partner is so handsome, Yumiko! My vision was too narrow! I\u2019ll ask my agent to find foreign stars for me.\"</p><br/><p>Yumiko smiled, her eyes narrowing to slits. \"You\u2019re right, Ms. Kyoko. You have to work harder now. If you became a superstar in Asia, you would get more chances to work abroad.\"</p><br/><p>Facing the mirror, Kyoko Fukada gently smoothed pink lip gloss over her lips and kissed the air. \"Mr. Qin is really handsome. All the girls will fall in love with him. Am I right, Yumiko?\"</p><br/><p>Yumiko was nervous. You are my elder sister, Fukada. This is just a photo album. Did you find your true love again?</p><br/><p>Kyoko seemed to know what she was thinking about. She turned around and cast a soft glance at her assistant.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, I prefer a man who can stay with me. I\u2019m a textbook feminist. A lover from a foreign country is not my cup of tea.\"</p><br/><p>She looked at herself in the large mirror. The girl reflected in it was dressed in a backless one-piece. \"I\u2019m jealous of those sexy girls,\" she murmured to herself disappointedly.</p><br/><p>She looked even younger when she grumbled.</p><br/><p>By the time Kyoko Fukada finished getting dressed and went to the studio, the crew had also arranged everything.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was standing on set in a dark grey suit, wearing a dark gold Citizen watch. The fine diamonds on it were shining in the light.</p><br/><p>He had broad shoulders and a straight back. The close-fitting suit complimented his slender waist and long legs.</p><br/><p>According to the script, Qin Guan, a successful businessman, had just found his other half. Wearing a long dress, Kyoko Fukada had to bend over his back with emotion and express her happiness for their meeting.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] Stamps here stand for men.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

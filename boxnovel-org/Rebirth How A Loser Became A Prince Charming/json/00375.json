The cocktail in the glass smelled dangerous.</p><br/><p> The property master had mixed Vodka and tomato juice, along with other ingredients.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan went up to the castle under the fake setting sun. The sunlight was warm and orange. The vampire looked gloomy and cold in his elegant, graceful clothes.</p><br/><p> His dark world was about to fall on Earth. Every inch of the land would tremble because of his fame.</p><br/><p> His fair fingers looked nearly transparent in the sunshine. His sharp teeth came into sight, stimulated by the blood.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Qin Guan moved. The proud vampire changed his attitude.</p><br/><p> With a fierce expression on his face, he roared to make his power clear to the weak human beings in the darkness. He looked like a provoked emperor.</p><br/><p> He opened his mouth wide, baring his sharp teeth before the audience. He looked extremely dangerous and savage, red tears running down his face. He seemed to be ready to kill someone.</p><br/><p> The whole crew was scared, but Cong Nianwei, who was never surprised by her boyfriend, took a calm sip of water.</p><br/><p> The bottle in Raynana\u2019s hand nearly fell to the floor. She was really frightened.</p><br/><p> However, there was another calm person on the set besides Cong Nianwei. The photographer, whose name was R, was working excitedly.</p><br/><p> He had originally been planning to ask his assistant to shoot for him so he could just control the composition and feeling of the photoshoot, but when he had heard Qin Guan's roar, the old man had stood up.</p><br/><p> He had grabbed the camera from his assistant and strode over to Qin Guan to be at the best shooting distance.</p><br/><p> Scarlet blood was silently blooming against the ancient castle like a poppy. Qin Guan looked dark and thirsty for light.</p><br/><p> I yearn for the warm sunshine in the winter, the sound of a heartbeat and the taste of warm blood. Alas, it is destiny that has brought me in this situation.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was lost in his imagination. He liked to express himself freely. Putting one of his hands on the fence, he held the wine glass up to his lips to take a sip. He used so much strength though that the castle, which was made of thin wooden boards and paper, fell down.</p><br/><p> So did Qin Guan. He fell down and got buried under the castle.</p><br/><p> The calm old man didn't stop shooting though. After a while, Qin Guan sat up from the ruins.</p><br/><p> The wine was all over his face. Even his silver hair had been stained red. The red wine crept down along his face and neck, reaching his pale sexy chest.</p><br/><p> \"Perfect! that's it!\" The silent old man uttered his first words for that day. The powerful vampire was now powerless. Weak, yet still attractive. R couldn\u2019t help but stride over to Qin Guan and get to work.</p><br/><p> When Qin Guan came back to his senses, R had already finished shooting. The old man and the young man looked at each other.</p><br/><p> \"Good boy! C, leave him my card.\"</p><br/><p> You gave five cents to a beggar, and you think that you saved the whole world? What a proud guy!</p><br/><p> When the crew pulled Qin Guan out of the ruins, the old man had already walked away leisurely, his hands clasped behind his back. His assistant handed a card to Cong Nianwei and ran away as soon as possible.</p><br/><p> Raynana was furious. The old man didn't even take her, the real boss, seriously. He had even forgotten to give her the negatives.</p><br/><p> \"Hey, wait a moment, Mr. R...\" Raynana ran after him with the bottle in her hand. She was not after the negatives. She just wanted revenge.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took off his hair piece and costume and washed his face with cleansing oil three times before he came out.</p><br/><p> The magazine would be released the next day, right on time for Halloween.</p><br/><p> Students at Columbia were a little annoyed by the holiday.</p><br/><p> There were decorations and people in costumes everywhere, even on campus.</p><br/><p> Various parties and festivities would be organized that day. Children were earnestly longing to get dressed up and collect candy that day.</p><br/><p> It was wonderful! Americans made that holiday a real carnival. Taking advantage of the happy atmosphere, the latest magazines were put on red newsstands on the streets. At the subway entrances and crossings, the fight over the magazines began early in the morning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

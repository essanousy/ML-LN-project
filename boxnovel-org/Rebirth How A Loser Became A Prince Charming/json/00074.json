Powerful!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lan Editor: Efydatia</p><br/><p>\"Ah! My bad, my bad! Stop, Sister Xue, it\u2019s hurting!\" Qin Guan pretended to be in pain.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue sighed and said, \"Professor Li is not just a tutor at college, but also one of the first official models in China, the current Vice Director of the China Model Association, and a standing counsellor of the National Model Promoting Department. Many renowned models used to be her students, including Zhai Qing and Ming Ming.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's mouth opened wider and wider. I have trained with Professor Li for such a long time, and she has shouted at me every day. Who could image that that serious old lady could be so influential in the modelling circle?</p><br/><p>Cold sweat ran all over Qin Guan's body as he recalled his behaviour. I might be the most unreliable student she has had in her whole life. When Sister Xue finished speaking, she got lost in thought. Qin Guan is Professor Li\u2019s treasure. He is talented, fit, and intelligent. All models dream of having his appearance, and Professor Li is sure of his inner talent, yet he only considers this profession a part-time job. The comparison is odious!</p><br/><p>Sister Xue came back to her senses and drove a shocked Qin Guan back to college. He needed to relax after the competition. Sister Xue drove back to the competition site and waited there until the afternoon. The organizing committee announced the local finalists after the preliminary competition.</p><br/><p>As expected, Sister Xue found Qin Guan's name at the top of the list. She took the notice for the final with joy and called Qin Guan. \"Hello, this is Sister Xue. You passed! What? What are you talking about? Donkey meat in baked wheaten cake?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan expressed his pleasure before making an unreasonable request. Sister Xue had to send the notice to his college and bring him dinner from a nearby restaurant.</p><br/><p>The donkey meat restaurant in the Zaojunmiao residential area was a small shop less than 200 metres away from Qin Guan's college. People queued up there to buy baked cakes with donkey meat.</p><br/><p>The meat was boiled with spices in a large cauldron, and the recipe was a secret. Their baked wheaten cake was even more famous. It had layers thinner than paper, and it was crisp, flavoured, and soft in the mouth.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue queued up breathlessly and fought to get two cakes and a bowl of donkey meat for Master Qin. He had to be served like a king. Fortunately, he had no requests besides delicious food. Qin Guan finished the donkey meat feast, read the notice carefully and lay in bed in satisfaction. He soon fell asleep. (He was so tough.)</p><br/><p>It was Monday August 16th, 1999. Sister Xue and Qin Guan arrived at the site for local final early. There were a lot less contestants this time. 30 female models and 30 male models had gathered at the competition site. Backstage, a casual cloth curtain prevented them from seeing each other.</p><br/><p>There were less people around this time, so assistants and agents could accompany them. Naturally, Sister Xue entered the backstage as Qin Guan's assistant. According to the arrangement of the organizing committee, they had to find the dressing team backstage. During the first round, they would show their personal accomplishments, and during the second round, Qin Guan would have to work with a female model who had the same number as him. They would show a group of outfits and equipment. Then it would be time for the judges to decide.</p><br/><p>The local final procedure was not that complicated. The key to qualifying was cooperating with the female contestants and choosing the right outfit and equipment. The male models would choose their outfits first, as their suits were comparatively simple. Then female models would choose outfits that matched their partners\u2019 choices. That was why the ladies were nervous. Their fate was in the hands of strangers.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue found a matching suit and gown on the hangers. Among all the strange outfits, that set was the most beautiful one. Before she could touch them though, a man squeezed in from the side and hit her with his shoulder.</p><br/><p>He caught the matching suit and gown in his hand. Sister Xue was angry. She used to be a heroine in the hutongs of the capital. Nobody could match her! Who dared steal something from her hands? She seized the thief\u2019s shoulder and reproached him, \"Take a turn!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my! It hurts! I\u2019m going to die!\" The man's face filled with tears.</p><br/><p>At the sight of his face, Sister Xue released his shoulder as if she had touched something nasty. She took three steps back and kept a distance of one metre from the thief.</p><br/><p>The man's eyes shined like a 1000-watt bulb when he saw Sister Xue. He rushed at her, howling excitedly, \"Miss Xue, my darling! I missed you so much! Why didn\u2019t you contact me? My heart was missing you dearly.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan touched the fine hair on his body and took one step back silently.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue failed to escape from the man's attack. A living human was actually hanging from her body.</p><br/><p>\"Let me go, Sissy Ou! Let me go! Are you deaf?\"</p><br/><p>The more he hugged her, the more the man wouldn't let go. Sister Xue pressed her hand hard against his face for fear that he would be pasted on her permanently.</p><br/><p>\"No, no, I won\u2019t let you go! Last time you said you'd call me, I waited for several years. I never got a call from you. You're so heartless.\" Sissy Ou rubbed his face on Sister Xue's palms as he spoke. \"You conscienceless girl! My name is Ou Qiang, the most masculine Ou Qiang!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan burst into laughter at his name. Ou Qiang? Oh, powerful? [1] Seeing the murderous expression in Sister Xue\u2019s eyes, he covered his mouth and went to laugh in the corner.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had business to do. She didn't have the time to chat with Sissy Ou. She stretched her hand out to him and said, \"Gimme!\"</p><br/><p>As he looked at the clothes and Sister Xue, Ou Qiang hesitated. Suddenly, a voice was heard from behind him, \"What are you standing there for, my elder brother? Have you made your choice?\" Dear me! My dearest younger cousin has come to my rescue!</p><br/><p>[1] In Chinese, Oh, powerful? is the phonogram of Ou Qiang.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

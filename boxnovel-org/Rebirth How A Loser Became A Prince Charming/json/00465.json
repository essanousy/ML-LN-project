The audience was absorbed in the films, laughing and crying depending on the scene they were watching.</p><br/><p>Director Gus covered his nervousness by wiping his tears away, while Lou was praying to all the oriental and occidental gods. Qin Guan felt nervous for the two competitors. After all, they were both his friends.</p><br/><p>The music faded away and the lights dimmed. Everyone fixed their eyes on the thin paper in the host's hands. After reading the paper, the host lifted his microphone up.</p><br/><p>\"The winner of the Palme d\u2019Or of the 56th Cannes Film Festival is\u2026\u2018Elephant\u2019!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Gus and Qin Guan bounced out of their seats, while Lou collapsed on his chair.</p><br/><p>Gus walked on the stage to make another speech. \"Elephant\" was undoubtedly the biggest winner of the festival. It had been nominated for three awards and won all three of them.</p><br/><p>Everyone applauded as flowers and colorful ribbons fell from the ceiling, signifying the perfect ending for the winners. There were also plenty of people who left feeling sad and lonely. Lou Ye was one of them.</p><br/><p>A celebration feast for Gus would be held with the judges and several tycoons of the film industry attending it. Qin Guan showed up for a while, but then he disappeared, leaving Sister Xue there alone.</p><br/><p>He was sitting in bed in his room, holding the phone. The person on the other end of the line answered the call. Qin Guan spoke in a quiet voice.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, it's me.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know.\"</p><br/><p>\"I won the Best Actor Award...\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I saw. Congratulations!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled proudly. \"What did you think of my speech? Were you touched?\"</p><br/><p>All the happiness and romance in the air came to an end with that shameless question. Cong Nianwei didn't want to talk to him anymore.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019ll talk tomorrow. I\u2019m in class now.\" They were in different time zones.</p><br/><p> \"I miss you.\"</p><br/><p>\"I miss you too.\"</p><br/><p>Fortunately, her boyfriend went back to normal again as they said goodbye.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to his senses and realized he had a boring night in France ahead of him.</p><br/><p>Bang, bang!</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, it's me!\" Lou was outside. Qin Guan opened the door for him in confusion.</p><br/><p>\"How did you know I was here?\"</p><br/><p>\"I saw you leave. Look who\u2019s here!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked outside. Zhang and Li Bingbing were standing behind Lou.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing here?\" Qin Guan grimaced at his acquaintance.</p><br/><p>\"Did you even see \u2018Purple Butterfly\u2019? I had a role in it.\" Li folded her arms across her chest. He\u2019s so handsome!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan closed his mouth slowly. Actually, he hadn\u2019t watched the film. Besides, Li only had a supporting part in it.</p><br/><p>Li cast a disgruntled look at Lou. \"I thought that you would win the award. No celebrations. No parties. I\u2019ll return with bare hands. I feel so miserable!\"</p><br/><p>She sneered at Zhang Yang and Lou Ye.</p><br/><p>\"And you, Qin Guan! You won the Cannes Best Actor Award! Why are you hiding in your hotel room? You have to treat us tonight! Your Sister Li is here!\"</p><br/><p>Damn!</p><br/><p>In 10 minutes, Qin Guan was walking along the back street of the hotel in a pair of slippers and J Clothing sportswear.</p><br/><p>There was a famous southern-style restaurant in Cannes. Its specialty was maionese with bruised garlic bulbs. During the film festival, Bernard Brochant, the Mayor of Cannes, had invited all the judges there for dinner.</p><br/><p>According to Jiang Wen, the restaurant smelled like Chinese dumplings restaurants. In the afternoon, when they\u2019d gotten together to evaluate the films, the meeting room had felt like a gas chamber. Even gum could only do so much.</p><br/><p>Only a restaurant like that could attract the attention of such foodies.</p><br/><p>That night, Cannes was bright with lights. They walked among the crowd leisurely.</p><br/><p>A long-lens camera craned around a small alley behind them. After a few clicks, it disappeared in the dark.</p><br/><p>\"Here it is!\" Lou found the restaurant easily. He was a frequent guest at the film festival.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve reserved a table for four. It\u2019s Mr. Lou...\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. Follow me, please.\"</p><br/><p>Only then did Qin Guan realize that this had been planned. Lou had set up a trap for him with Li.</p><br/><p>He looked at the decorations secretly. Luckily, it looked like a family restaurant, not a gourmet one.</p><br/><p>They took their seats. Qin Guan let out a long breath of relief when he saw the menu. My wallet will be safe.</p><br/><p>It was a traditional French menu. According to the rules, there were 13 dishes, starting with appetizers and ending with dessert. New menus only offered three to five dishes though, and the arrogant French didn\u2019t use English, except for tourists.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The seniors were much better, while everyone in their twenties became high school students again.</p><br/><p>Why was Qin Guan not influenced?</p><br/><p>Please, he was actually older than 50 years old.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Qin Guan would be working with the cunning Karen.</p><br/><p>They would be filming a masked ball together. As a beautiful girl, she had dressed up as a bunny. She was wearing a white bikini, two long fluffy ears and a tail.</p><br/><p>The prop master had tried his best to dress the girls right. As the hero, Qin Guan was just wearing a football team uniform. Fortunately, he didn't need to put on a helmet.</p><br/><p>The extras crowded the room. They were getting paid 8-10 dollars an hour, so the director was hoping that the scene would be finished as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Mark began to shoot.</p><br/><p>Using her most innocent voice, Karen told her ex-boyfriend, \"Do you know that girl Katie?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. \"Yes, she is pretty nice. I invited her to the ball tonight.\"</p><br/><p>The happiness on his face hurt her heart. Without thinking, she said, \"Beware of her. She has fallen in love with you.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was happy to hear that. It felt like he had found some meat in a plate of cheap noodles.</p><br/><p>His expression made Karen even more depressed. \"She has written your name on a T-shirt and put it on underneath her clothes. She has told everybody about it,\" she added.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"You are really handsome after all. She also collects any tissues you have used. She wants to use an African spell to make you fall in love with her.\"</p><br/><p>The muscles on Qin Guan\u2019s face stiffened. \"What?\" he managed to say.</p><br/><p>\"Interesting! He doesn't rely on his appearance. He is actually a good actor.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Generally speaking, popular boys don\u2019t understand weirdos.\"</p><br/><p>It seemed that there were many weird students among the cast.</p><br/><p>The scene went on. That scheming b*tch Karen was watching Lindsay across the dance floor with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan turned around, Karen told him, \"Please don\u2019t laugh at her. She might be a weirdo, but she is my friend.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan eventually yielded and the two of them kissed each other.</p><br/><p>Karen was laughing internally. B*tch! So what if you are the protagonist? Qin Guan kissed me first!</p><br/><p>The cameraman worked extra hard on the scene. The couple looked beautiful as they moved before the camera.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the first to wake up. He pushed Karen away, saying, \"What are you doing? We have broken up!\"</p><br/><p>Karen locked her arms around his neck tight. \"When? I didn't agree to that. You are so charming... I\u2019d never break up with you!\"</p><br/><p>He was her one true love. Feeling the deep love of the campus belle, Qin Guan closed his eyes and hugged her thin waist.</p><br/><p>They kissed like crazy among the crowd, as if there was no one else present. Of course, there was no tongue involved. Qin Guan just pasted his lips on hers. He was a gentleman after all.</p><br/><p>Karen had a favorable impression of Qin Guan. Lindsay is right. He is a nice guy...</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\" the director shouted at them cheerfully. He was very satisfied with the scene.</p><br/><p>By then, it was already dark outside. Their work was finished for that day. Qin Guan said goodbye to the director and left. He hadn't realized that the distributor of the film was Paramount Pictures, which was famous for its commercial success.</p><br/><p>Ever since Qin Guan had been cast, the PR Department of Paramount Pictures had been working hard.</p><br/><p>The next morning, there were news about the film in many big city newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times.</p><br/><p>\"The protagonist of \u2018Mean Girls\u2019 has been selected. Jonathan Bennett lost to Asian actor Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"The most fashionable teen film and the most fashionable leading actor...\"</p><br/><p>\"Many fashion brands, including LEE, are sponsoring \u2018Mean Girls\u2019. Each actress is wearing more than 40 different outfits.\"</p><br/><p>Paramount made good use of Qin Guan's popularity in the fashion circle. They not only managed to get new sponsors for the costume department, but also promote the film indirectly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

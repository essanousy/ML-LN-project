All the older actors rushed towards the delicious food. </p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there was only a limited amount of porridge, so only </p><br/><p>the main actors could have some.</p><br/><p>When </p><br/><p>he saw the small bowl in his agent's hands, Du felt sick. The </p><br/><p>haughty young man had never spoken to Qin Guan ever since he had </p><br/><p>joined the crew. Did this mean that he had been gradually accepted?</p><br/><p>His </p><br/><p>agent shook his head at the happy guy. He was still a greenhand. The </p><br/><p>crew wouldn't notice a single person's lack of politeness. The only </p><br/><p>solid foundation an actor needed was talent.</p><br/><p>\"It's </p><br/><p>so delicious! Qin Guan was really kind to share it with us...\"</p><br/><p>The </p><br/><p>agent let out a long sigh. I should give him some lessons in the </p><br/><p>future.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, </p><br/><p>Qin Guan was eating and murmuring sadly about his food. The porridge </p><br/><p>was not enough for him. Plus, Ma Shaohua had taken the best part of </p><br/><p>the crab as compensation for that disgusting fish he'd had to eat.</p><br/><p>When </p><br/><p>he looked at Cong Nianwei though, Qin Guan calmed down. As long as </p><br/><p>she was there, they could find more gourmet food in their spare time. </p><br/><p>This was important, as he might have to visit that film base many </p><br/><p>times in the future. He had to plan ahead for his future work.</p><br/><p>As </p><br/><p>he thought about that, he couldn't help but look at Cong Nianwei </p><br/><p>with love and tenderness. The older actors, who were currently </p><br/><p>picking their teeth, realized their secret immediately.</p><br/><p>Ma </p><br/><p>Shaohua pulled at Qin Guan's robe and pointed to Cong Nianwei. \"Do </p><br/><p>you like her?\"</p><br/><p>\"She </p><br/><p>is my wife.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? </p><br/><p>You got married?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hush! </p><br/><p>She's my girlfriend. We haven't gotten married yet.\"</p><br/><p>\"Be </p><br/><p>careful then. There are lots of people coming and going around here. </p><br/><p>The director has forbidden leaking any photos or information, but she </p><br/><p>can't watch everyone.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, </p><br/><p>Master Ma. Don't worry. We are not keeping it a secret.\"</p><br/><p>\"So </p><br/><p>you are planning on getting married?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of </p><br/><p>course.\"</p><br/><p>\"So </p><br/><p>you made the home run!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of </p><br/><p>course I have. She is not pestering me to get married.\"</p><br/><p>The </p><br/><p>older actors looked at him sympathetically. That's not what a home </p><br/><p>run means, young man. Just forget it. Young people are really </p><br/><p>eccentric. Charm can't solve everything nowadays.</p><br/><p>Everyone </p><br/><p>suddenly was kind to Qin Guan. Handsome guys are not always lucky. </p><br/><p>I got a wife easier than him.</p><br/><p>Qin </p><br/><p>Guan had no idea what they were thinking as he prepared for the next </p><br/><p>scene. Meanwhile, as more and more actors joined the crew, the hotels </p><br/><p>filled with people.</p><br/><p>Wang </p><br/><p>suddenly pulled Qin Guan away for a fitting. The two of them walked </p><br/><p>between the luggage slowly.</p><br/><p>By </p><br/><p>then, Qin Guan's character had become the emperor's brother-in-law. </p><br/><p>His elder sister was no longer a concubine, but a mighty queen.</p><br/><p>His </p><br/><p>costume was also better than his previous ones. The light red muslin </p><br/><p>that covered his white robe looked absolutely royal.</p><br/><p>During </p><br/><p>that scene, he gave Prince Liang a hand by taking advantage of his </p><br/><p>identity. His sister gave him some jade bracelets to thank him for </p><br/><p>his bright idea.</p><br/><p>The </p><br/><p>clear, shining jade shocked the new members of the crew.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! </p><br/><p>They look so nice. Is there something wrong with my eyes? They look </p><br/><p>totally real!\"</p><br/><p>\"They </p><br/><p>are. Look at the security personnel over there!\" a kind person </p><br/><p>explained to Tao Hong. The princess had just joined the crew.</p><br/><p>Qin </p><br/><p>Guan fixed his eyes on the bracelets without dignity.</p><br/><p>Director </p><br/><p>Hu zoomed in hard, so only the four bracelets and Qin Guan's face </p><br/><p>were left in the frame.</p><br/><p>After </p><br/><p>a few seconds, Qin Guan smiled and turned his head around to turn </p><br/><p>down the reward.</p><br/><p>\"No, </p><br/><p>thanks. I have been studying at home lately. I have been paying no </p><br/><p>attention to other affairs.\"</p><br/><p>Despite </p><br/><p>his sincere words, his eyes were still fixed on the jewellery. He </p><br/><p>craved that fortune. He suddenly gave his sister a flattering smile. </p><br/><p>\"My sister is the queen now, so I have to be self-disciplined.\"</p><br/><p>He </p><br/><p>seemed like an honest, sincere young man.</p><br/><p>Tao </p><br/><p>Hong learned something about the famous actor through his </p><br/><p>performance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What can I do for you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha! Chinese people are so eager to help. My friends were right. Actually, I have two problems that need solving...\"</p><br/><p>Qu was alarmed. The Chief was an old fox, so she had to be careful around him.</p><br/><p>\"You could talk to our lawyer about those problems. I'm sorry, but we can't agree to any terms like this.\"</p><br/><p>Henry was shocked by her words. She seemed to be on her guard about any possible danger. The man burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"You misunderstood! What I want has nothing to do with my job, but it is relative to yours.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is usually the job of our PR department, but I would like to take over. I'm the one talking face to face with a celebrity after all. Everyone knows that the image of the police is an essential part of a city.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Qu relaxed. They thought that the Chief would ask them to be his spies or something else along that line. Considering that they were both Chinese though, that would be impossible...</p><br/><p>As they talked about the job, Qu got a grip on herself again.</p><br/><p>\"Could you please describe the job for me?\" she asked. Qin Guan's schedule was fixed after all. It was hard to add something spontaneously.</p><br/><p>\"Well, it's pretty simple, actually. In late September and early October, we will be shooting a short film of public interest regarding community service. As you know, a lot of defendants tried in New York are sentenced to community service, especially younger criminals. Most people are unsatisfied with the results though. The majority of the defendants just muddle through the work without being productive.\"</p><br/><p>\"Therefore, the New York Police and the municipal government want to promote the importance of community service. The job will only take a day.\"</p><br/><p>Qu took out her notebook and saw that Qin Guan had some free time then. The Milan Fashion Week would have ended by that time. She nodded at the Chief. \"What about the second problem?\"</p><br/><p>Henry seemed awkward at the question. He fixed his clothes and sat up properly.</p><br/><p>\"That is a private affair of our station. At the end of the year, a New Year Police Party will be held all over America. Except for the policemen on duty, all junior policemen will take part and have a good time. This event promotes the cooperation between different departments and reduces stress.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, our seniors will be having another party, which is strictly exclusive. All the guests invited are private connections of the sergeants. You must be aware that destiny ties colleagues together. I can't be friends with some guy named Jack from a Los Angeles police station...\"</p><br/><p>\"Each party is very proud... It's easy to find a celebrity in Los Angeles, but in New York our only choice is finding a talented Wall Street broker. As soon as I found out that Qin Guan was in my station, I felt the need to visit you personally and express my sincerity.\"</p><br/><p>\"What would beat a two-time Best Actor Award winner? Am I right, my agent?\"</p><br/><p>The Chief skipped the diplomatic language and talked to them like old friends. Qu had a general idea of the job now.</p><br/><p>A short film would be okay. Of course, it would be free of charge. Showing up at the private party will also be free. Considering his value, Qin Guan will suffer a loss.</p><br/><p>Putting on her most professional smile, Qu answered, \"We would be honored to support the work of the government, but how would Qin Guan get rewarded for his contribution?\"</p><br/><p>Henry rubbed his hands to hide his excitement. \"We will issue medals for the people who have made a great contribution to the community. They will be traditional police badges. How does that sound?\"</p><br/><p>Qu exchanged a glance with Qin Guan and saw that he was interested. She turned around with a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>\"We will be waiting to hear from you. We can't wait to collaborate with you!\"</p><br/><p>\"I am looking forward to it!\"</p><br/><p>They shook hands, and then Qin Guan and Qu left the meeting room.</p><br/><p>The two of them went out of the station feeling relaxed. Xu had already heard about the affair. The rest was left to Cui Ming, who would of course charge them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

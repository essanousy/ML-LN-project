The protagonist of his film was an ordinary miner struggling in life.</p><br/><p>Li Yang brought his newly-discovered protagonist along for dinner. The boy, who had never acted in a film before, had suddenly become the hero of an international film. What a lucky guy!</p><br/><p>As Li Yang introduced them, Qin Guan shot an envious look in the direction he was pointing at. Then he burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Some actors could make Qin Guan laugh just with their appearance. The list went like this: Huang Bo (No.1), Xu Zheng (No.2) and Wang Baoqiang (No.3).</p><br/><p>He wondered what Li Yang's team had been thinking about. Maybe there had been no team. Li Yang hadn't hired a stylist for Wang. The guy had showed up just as he was.</p><br/><p>His yellow hair was messy, and his grey loose suit looked strange on his body. He ran up to them in a hurry, sweat glistening on his forehead.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter, director?\"</p><br/><p>He looked admiringly at the director who had taken him abroad, with an honest expression shining in his eyes. He looked just like a Husky.</p><br/><p>\"I want to introduce a new friend to you. He is also a Chinese actor. His film is participating in the festival.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, this is my protagonist, Wang Baoqiang.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wang Baoqiang, this is Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>Holding back his laughter, Qin Guan stretched his hand out, shaking the guy\u2019s hand tightly.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Guan, how do you do? You are so talented. You are my idol... I am trying to learn from you.\"</p><br/><p>Unprecedented passion shone in his eyes. He knew the young man was formidable, but he couldn\u2019t tell why. If my director considers him formidable, then he must be.</p><br/><p>\"Just call me Brother Qin or Qin Guan. No need to call me Brother Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why?\"</p><br/><p>Because you have a poor accent... If Qu heard it, I would never live this down...</p><br/><p>Wang was an honest man. Qin Guan was older than him by one year, but he admired Qin Guan a lot.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I will just call you Elder Brother. You are so handsome!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not comment on his taste.</p><br/><p>The three Chinese men began their short journey in Berlin, a strict city full of tall men. As a tough country, Germany was famous for its strictness and regulations. On the evening of the Berlin Film Festival though, the city looked lovely.</p><br/><p>The mascot of the festival, which was a bear, could be seen everywhere around the city in different poses. It looked both pretty and funny.</p><br/><p>Some stores had dressed the mascot in colorful traditional costumes, which added a sense of fun to the boring streets.</p><br/><p>The food in Germany was no better than the atmosphere. British food was rightfully considered the worst in Europe, but German food was the first runner-up.</p><br/><p>Even though Germany was a large nation, there were only a few dishes that could be enjoyed by foreigners. These included sausages, pig elbows, beef, and pig knuckles. If one also took beer into consideration, then Germany\u2019s reputation could be saved.</p><br/><p>Li Yang led them to a small household restaurant at a small corner of the city. The customers included idlers who spent their whole day drinking beer and kids who bought takeaway for school.</p><br/><p>Most of the customers were nearby residents who wanted to enjoy pig elbows.</p><br/><p>When the food was served, Qin Guan realized he had overestimated Li Yang\u2019s taste. In his opinion, brine pig elbows, which were a famous dish in Berlin, were just pig elbows boiled in salty water. He wondered why the other two guys were eating them with such relish, especially Wang, who was actually sucking on his fingers.</p><br/><p>\"Try the side dishes. I\u2019m not kidding! They are delicious!\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang stared at the broccoli and pickles on Qin Guan's plate with a hungry expression in his eyes. Qin Guan had to swallow a piece of broccoli and some mashed potatoes.</p><br/><p> They were a perfect combination! The salty pork was delicious and matched the broccoli and potatoes well. If one had it with cold beer, it seemed like the most supreme taste in the world.</p><br/><p>The three Chinese men finished two portions of food each and left, surprising the simple, honest restaurant owner.</p><br/><p>\"If only all the customers ate as much as them!\"</p><br/><p>\"If they did, we would run out of supplies and starve...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His popularity notwithstanding, he was the most handsome out of all the actors there.</p><br/><p>Hasty staff were shuttling around the hotel lobby. Qin Guan sat down on a couch, waiting for Wang Jingcao.</p><br/><p>Several black and blue business vehicles were parked before the gate. Wang got out of one and walked up to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>She patted Qin Guan's suit and told him happily, \"That last car is your throne. I found someone to accompany you on the red carpet. Here she is.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around and saw Li Bingbing walk over in a long red dress.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. \"Sister Bingbing! Why didn't you call me? Do you see me as an outsider?\"</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing laughed and stretched her arm out to Qin Guan. \"Ha! Today I\u2019ll be sharing your honor. I\u2019ve been begging Sister Wang to attend a red carpet for a long time. Am I not qualified to be your partner?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took her hand. \"It would be my honor!\"</p><br/><p>Li smiled at Qin Guan and asked, \"Shall we go now, Sister Wang?\"</p><br/><p>Wang was busy talking to Sister Xue and the other agents and assistants. \"Xiao Qin is a green hand. Share your experience with him,\" she said softly.</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing pulled Qin Guan into the car happily. \"Quick, let\u2019s go! I wonder if the company following us is China Entertainment. Their first pair will be superstars, so we have to be quick. Otherwise, those snobbish reporters will focus on them, and we\u2019ll look awkward.\"</p><br/><p>They got in the backseat of the car.</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! You have played very influential roles in TV shows, Sister Bingbing!\"</p><br/><p>Li lifted her long dress and replied sadly, \"But I still couldn't get a good script. I signed a contract with Sister Wang for a better chance.\"</p><br/><p>She heaved a great sigh, but cheered up again in a moment.</p><br/><p>She poked at Qin Guan's arm. \"What about you? Well done, boy! You are famous now! You\u2019ve made the headlines. Do you plan on signing a contract with Sister Wang? Then you\u2019ll have to call me Senior Sister!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grinned. \"No, Sister Wang just helped me a lot. I\u2019ll cooperate with W. Brothers in the future. I\u2019ll appreciate your help then.\"</p><br/><p>Li smirked and pulled at his cheek with her red nails.</p><br/><p>\"Don't smile at a girl like this, Qin Guan. It\u2019s dangerous. I\u2019m a tough woman, so I won't be enchanted, but you\u2019d be in danger if you met a more shrewd woman.\"</p><br/><p>\"That hurts, Sister.\"</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing reluctantly loosened her fingers and let Qin Guan go. How does he look after his skin?</p><br/><p>The cars slowed down. The leading cars parked into their reserved places right in front of the red carpet.</p><br/><p>The security staff had circled the area with ropes, and guards were standing around at a certain distance.</p><br/><p>The reporters were at their posts, pointing their cameras towards the carpet.</p><br/><p>Far back, there were some fans who wanted to applaud for their idols.</p><br/><p>At the other end of the carpet, there was a signature board and two hosts waiting on both its sides.</p><br/><p>It was time to enter.</p><br/><p>Following the directions, the first car parked at the end of the red carpet. Pu Cunxin got out and stepped onto the carpet. He was the first superstar to appear.</p><br/><p>Experienced actors set foot on the carpet according to priority. Flashlights twinkled like crazy and fans screamed loudly. It was a supreme honor for a star to be walking on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing looked at the next car and let out a breath of relief. \"Don't worry, it's just a small company who wants to be exposed to the public.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. He was ready for his first appearance on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>The door of the car opened and a long leg in black pants strode out.</p><br/><p>The onlookers held their breath, waiting to see its owner.</p><br/><p>Judging from his slender leg, it must be a handsome guy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got out of the car and stood still. The crowd suddenly fell silent. They felt the cold autumn become warmer.</p><br/><p>Everyone held their breath, afraid that they would scare the fairy away. Only the clicks of the shutters could be heard.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was used to that kind of show, walked through the crowd without feeling nervous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Some of them had come from auction houses around the world, while others from private collections.</p><br/><p>They all expressed the owner's love for Chinese antiques. Some guests with the same hobby took out their magnifying glasses to evaluate the collection.</p><br/><p>As they all got absorbed in the exhibition, Xie Guomin shot a look at his assistant. The door of the room was closed silently. All the security cameras around the mansion were operating.</p><br/><p>When everything was over, Xie walked up to the princess. The two of them whispered something to each other to get a confirmation.</p><br/><p>Then the princess said, \"According to my information, a military coup was attempted about an hour ago. The government is cornered. We have to wait for more details.\"</p><br/><p>Her words were short, but informative. The antique fans came back to their senses instantly. The crowd stirred as they drew a breath as one. It was like a water drop falling into a cauldron full of oil.</p><br/><p>\"What? This is an emergency. Why weren't we notified?\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder what the army is planning on doing.\"</p><br/><p>Although the guests were worried, they were not panic-stricken. Military coups happened every day in Thailand. Everyone was just calmly talking about the next steps, which shocked the Chinese people in the room.</p><br/><p>Hey! We are talking about a coup d'etat! Why are you all so relaxed? This would have been unheard of in China!</p><br/><p>Xie Hanren could see Qin Guan's confusion, so he tried to explain Thailand's tradition.</p><br/><p>Ever since the king had lost control of the troops, the military had been self-governing. The current king and princess might have seemed like media mascots, but they actually had strong connections to the army. The king always expressed his opinion about political parties and the government. It was hard to tell whether the domestic chaos had originated from the king or the troops anymore.</p><br/><p>The wise Chinese guests concluded that the army was the key to steady political power.</p><br/><p>That explained the calmness of the princess. People didn't care that much about the matter. Meanwhile, the TV could receive a signal from outside, so they found out what was going on.</p><br/><p>Information spread conveniently thanks to the smart reporters. Thailand was a renowned tourist destination, so there were many foreign reporters stationed there. Before the situation was even stable, they had already gone out looking for precious inside information.</p><br/><p>The existence of war correspondents showed a kind of noble sentiment, while the military was needed to comfort people. Thanks to the news broadcast, they found out that the smooth process of handing and taking over political power had only taken three hours.</p><br/><p>In combination with some technical procedures, the government change had taken about five hours. The harmony that followed pleased everyone. Soon, the security guards informed them that the emergency was over. All the guests could now leave safely.</p><br/><p>The next morning, they would see a new prime minister on TV. Thailand was so efficient!</p><br/><p>The security measures around the mansion were still in place, in case some people took advantage of the situation to try something in the area.</p><br/><p>After those exciting events, Qin Guan and his team returned to their rooms tiredly. They needed to have a good night's sleep in order to relax.</p><br/><p>The first thing Qin Guan did was take a bath. The water drops fell on his body, making him feel refreshed.</p><br/><p>Bang, bang! There was somebody knocking on the door.</p><br/><p>\"Who's there? It's really late!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's me! Wang Liying.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait a moment. I'm taking a bath!\"</p><br/><p>\"No. Just check your email, Brother Qin!\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>The girl left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

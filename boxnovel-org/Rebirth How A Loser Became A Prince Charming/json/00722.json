Suddenly, Bu stopped him, taking out and handing him a pair of large sunglasses.</p><br/><p>\"Are you kidding? It's night!\"</p><br/><p>\"Listen to me! Hurry! They are coming!\" Bu whispered urgently. Qin Guan opened his eyes wide behind the glasses. You are so clever! I like it!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to the room, feeling his way in by touching the walls. He could see nothing with those glasses on.</p><br/><p>He found a chair behind a square table and sat down. Then his guests came in, surrounded by some other people. The two men were wearing black shirts, black pants and gray ties. They looked really strange in the hot summer.</p><br/><p>Their leader, who was very brave, looked up in shock to meet the true face of the master. His tongue was tied as his eyes focused on the man sitting in the middle.</p><br/><p>There were three men before them. The two men on the sides were wearing white shirts and black pants, and tattoos of tigers and dragons were visible under their collars. Their black leather shoes were shining under the dim light as they sat in their chairs in an imposing manner, gazing at the guests with great interest.</p><br/><p>The man in the middle looked extraordinary. His face was as white as jade, and he was sitting there as straight as a pine and as calm as a mountain. He was not moving, but his lingering charm attracted everyone in the room.</p><br/><p>As he'd entered, he had noticed the mysterious man's steps. Some people walked like rigid wood, while others moved like willows in the breeze. That man was different though. His posture was neither delicate nor rough, but he radiated an unspeakable appeal.</p><br/><p> He could attract everyone's attention just by sitting there. His charm was undeniable. He was calm, quiet and extremely elegant.</p><br/><p>When he looked down though, he was confused. The man in the middle looked like royalty from the neck up, but he was wearing an ordinary tank top and a pair of shorts below.</p><br/><p>Of course, elite men were also allowed to wear shorts, but not during a formal meeting. When he looked farther down, he noticed a pair of flip flops.</p><br/><p>The intruder relaxed, straightening his back and fixing his tie as he waved at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Let's talk calmly, dude. Whoever you are, you must have been invited here by the residents.\"</p><br/><p>The man smiled and spat out the dust and sand in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\"I actually think I know you guys. What's your territory in the capital? Does the boss of the Dongcheng District know about you? You must be in charge of another area, or you wouldn't have intervened...\"</p><br/><p>Bu grinned at him, but Wang Hailiang stood up impatiently and kicked the man hard on the butt.</p><br/><p>\"You are so annoying! Are you aware of the situation?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\" The man, who was quite smart, rolled on the ground and changed his attitude immediately.</p><br/><p>\"Grandpa! You are the grandpa!\"</p><br/><p>Wang was really annoyed by the man. Before he could give him a second kick though, Qin Guan coughed.</p><br/><p>\"We are law-abiding citizens, Brother Wang. Wait for his answer. If it does not satisfy us...\"</p><br/><p>\"Then we can beat them to death!\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly!\"</p><br/><p>The second man in black shivered at their ruthless words, but the man in the middle said calmly, \"Answer my question. Who are you?\"</p><br/><p>The leader stood up and dusted off his clothes. Before he could say anything, his subordinate answered for him eagerly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

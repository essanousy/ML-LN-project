Even a studio on Grace Building was enough for them.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's status as a student protected him well. He was not interested in looking for an agent there.</p><br/><p> Many Chinese models had agents, while others worked independently.</p><br/><p> They got a little tired when they attended auditions, but they were able to avoid lots of trouble. It was a good choice for Qin Guan at the time.</p><br/><p> Besides, there was no model union in New York, like the actor union on Broadway or Hollywood. There was only one in the UK.</p><br/><p> The brave Asian boy jumped into the melting pot.</p><br/><p> It was Xu Xiaoxiao, and not his girlfriend, who was interested in the auditions the most.</p><br/><p> Clinging to the notion that Qin Guan didn\u2019t have a car, he offered to be his temporary driver while Qin Guan was looking for a part-time job.</p><br/><p>\"It will take you a long time to get from Chelsea Street to Times Square. If you take the bus, you will be able to make two auditions at best.\"</p><br/><p> \"It's a waste of time! I\u2019m not helping you for free. Let me copy your homework, and I\u2019ll be your driver till you buy a car.\"</p><br/><p> What a cunning guy!</p><br/><p> \"Okay! Thank you for your help. See you tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p> \"See you!\"</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao parked his Ford under the dormitory. When Qin Guan knocked on the window the next day, Xu realized that his classmate had changed clothes.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was in a black short-sleeved shirt with round delicate buttons that looked like pearls. When he sat down in the passenger seat, his pants didn't have any wrinkles.</p><br/><p> When he got out with his LV handbag a while later, Xu was still staring at his back.</p><br/><p> He tried his best to fix his eyes on the steering wheel, afraid that he would get dizzy and cause an accident on the busy street.</p><br/><p> After a long time, Xu came back to his senses. He bought a cup of iced coffee to calm himself down.</p><br/><p> He didn\u2019t believe in the Chinese proverb that \"one could become quite a different person\". In his opinion, it was an exaggeration. On that day though, he experienced the accurate, profound wisdom of the Chinese. Qin Guan was the realization of that proverb.</p><br/><p> Xu was feeling confident about Qin Guan's audition, as he had seen four girls on the street look surprised by Qin Guan's appearance. Everyone knew that New Yorkers didn\u2019t care about strangers. As a result, Xu was very confident about Qin Guan\u2019s interview.</p><br/><p> Times Square, where the top 10 brands from all over the world gathered, was Qin Guan\u2019s first destination. The studios and agencies were in the building behind the mansion.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan followed the crowd into the elevator, looking carefully at the map of the studios John had given him. He would make good use of his time.</p><br/><p> Armani was his first destination. Their traditional formal wear style fit Qin Guan\u2019s personality.</p><br/><p> Unfortunately, this was also a battlefield for models. It was even a first choice for supermodels, let alone agencies.</p><br/><p> Armani chose very few new models every year, and 99.999% of them were recommended by companies. Qin Guan would have to fight for a 0.001% chance.</p><br/><p> He decided to deliver his resume personally.</p><br/><p> Some experienced models couldn't bear the strict terms companies and agents set or yield to their dirty deals and latent rules. They were familiar with the circle and they tried to introduce themselves to the designers and branding businesses by delivering their resumes personally.</p><br/><p> They knew the locations of the designers\u2019 studios and the brand companies, as well as the time of brand launching events and shows.</p><br/><p> They worked harder for themselves, waiting eagerly for a chance. They were usually welcomed by independent designers, as the designers could find suitable models for their concepts that way.</p><br/><p> Besides, models could be discovered in small shows by famous brands and then soar up to the sky.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan didn't think much about that. As a foreigner in the city, this was the best way for him to proceed.</p><br/><p> The Armani offices were simple and plain, like any other office in the universe. There was nothing on the white walls except the designer\u2019s logo.</p><br/><p> The lobby was as quiet as a fantasy world.</p><br/><p> The girl in black at the reception looked busy. She was arranging files. After they were sorted, they would be sent to different departments.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, she turned around and saw the visitor. She knew what he wanted right away.</p><br/><p> Pointing to the elegant boxes beside the entrance, she said, \"Put your resume in the corresponding box. Thank you.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

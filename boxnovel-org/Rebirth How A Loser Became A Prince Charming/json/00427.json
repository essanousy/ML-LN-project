Her face was nearly paralysed from smiling.</p><br/><p>\"No, thanks,\" the hero said politely. The director turned to camera No. 2 reluctantly.</p><br/><p>The warm-hearted policeman spoke again, \"Are you Vaughan? I know your family...\"</p><br/><p>The director didn\u2019t zoom in on him immediately though. Instead, he switched to camera No. 3. Qin Guan was smiling friendly in the driver\u2019s seat. His eyes were fixed on his partner.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Look at his face!\" The assistant director was speechless. This is not a romance film. Why are you so excited?</p><br/><p>\"Switch to that camera.\" The assistant director couldn\u2019t help but obey the director. Finally, the poor policeman got his close-up.</p><br/><p>\"Skow, come out. Say hello to the brave soldier!\"</p><br/><p>The assistant director saw the joy in the director\u2019s eyes. He was actually pouting. It\u2019s a misfortune to have a director like him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got out of the car and uttered his first line in the film. \"Welcome back, soldier.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good! Such a pleasant voice...\"</p><br/><p>F*ck! How can you tell from one line? The other guy has said so much, yet he hasn\u2019t earned any praise.</p><br/><p>The policemen drove the hero back home. The first scene was finished.</p><br/><p>\"Good! Cut!\" Qin Guan drove the car back to the cameras.</p><br/><p>\"Good work! It's a good day today. We can get more work done. Five-minute break!\"</p><br/><p>The director ran to his backpack and took out his wallet. There was a newspaper clipping in it with an impressive picture of Qin Guan\u2019s face. It was the advertisement of the Armani perfume.</p><br/><p>Trembling, the tough man with the curly black hair walked up to Qin Guan with the picture.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, could you please sign this for me?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was surprised to see the director call the figurant by his name. She was enlightened at the sight of the picture though. He had to be a fan of Qin Guan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\"No problem. One minute.\" Sitting down on a brick, Qin Guan smiled at the director. He pointed to another brick across from him. \"Sit down, please. What would you like me to write?\"</p><br/><p>The man looked excited. He sat down and rubbed his hands together, moving his brick closer to Qin Guan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\"To my truest fan, Kelvin Brey. A heart would also be appreciated.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan signed the back of the picture according to his request. When he looked up, he nearly fell down from fright.</p><br/><p>The director was so close to him that he was nearly sitting on his legs. Their noses were almost touching.</p><br/><p>The assistant director couldn\u2019t put up with this. He walked over and pulled Kelvin up from the collar.</p><br/><p>\"Okay. Get ready for the next scene, everyone!\"</p><br/><p>\"My picture... My picture...\" Before Kelvin could burst into tears, Sister Xue ran over and stuffed the picture into his hands. He couldn't help but smile through his tears. \"I can die happy now...\"</p><br/><p>What an unworthy life.</p><br/><p>The following scene went smooth. In 10 minutes, Qin Guan's part was finished. Sister Xue let out a long breath of relief.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s get your payment and go! Tomorrow you\u2019ll be on the red carpet of the Oscars.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan followed Sister Xue back to the hotel with a contented smile. It was a dreamless, happy night.</p><br/><p>The next day, Sister Xue carefully took out the Armani Haute Couture from the closet. Qin Guan was speechless.</p><br/><p>\"You are so dramatic. Does your hand hurt?\"</p><br/><p>\"Put it on, you idiot. Careful! Don't wrinkle it!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put on the outfit piece by piece. The extraordinary couture gradually revealed itself.</p><br/><p>It was definitely worth its price of three million dollars. The fabric was extremely expensive. Every thread had been weaved according to the designer\u2019s inspiration.</p><br/><p>Plus, it had been custom-made for Qin Guan\u2019s figure. The simple black suit, the bow made of the same fabric, and the gem buttons on the cuffs were a perfect combination.</p><br/><p>\"I can't tell the difference between an ordinary suit and this. The design is almost the same, and no one would be able to judge the fabric or the techniques.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wasn\u2019t terrified at the idea of wearing an expensive outfit. He knew nothing about its uncommon features until he arrived at the site.</p><br/><p>Comparison helped. All the other outfits seemed to be missing something.</p><br/><p>The Oscars red carpet was different from the one in China. It was divided into two parts, one for stars and one for guests.</p><br/><p>Different attendants were treated differently. Most of the attendants were directors, producers and superstars unwilling to show off. They preferred to chat with each other in the guest area and take this chance to form new relationships.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

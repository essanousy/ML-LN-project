The club is arranged in good order. Troublemakers will be dealt with by the guards. The managers in charge of different floors will handle any guests who refuse to pay. The disputes among girls will be settled by Wenwen. What does she have to tell me? I\u2019m too afraid to get into trouble.\"</p><br/><p>The shining screen attracted their attention. There was food, drinks and a soccer match. They didn't care about other people\u2019s affairs.</p><br/><p>They were concentrated on the fierce match, when the door was suddenly pushed open again. Mou Xiaoliu waved at Qin Guan, who was holding a green soy bean in his mouth. \"Hurry, Senior Qin!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised his eyebrows and left the room. His roommates glanced at him before turning back to the match.</p><br/><p>Before he could ask Mou what was going on, the girl pulled his arm and headed for the elevator. Qin Guan staggered alongside her.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, take it easy! I\u2019ll come with you. Just tell me what's the matter.\"</p><br/><p>Mou Xiaoliu stuck Qin Guan inside the elevator. She pressed the button for the sixth floor and let out a long breath.</p><br/><p>\"Boss Wang is beating a guy to death. Boss Bu is not in today. You\u2019re the only one in the club who can talk to him.\"</p><br/><p>The door to the sixth floor opened slowly. Qin Guan walked to the office at the end of the corridor and asked Mou, \"What is Da Niu doing? Just get him!\"</p><br/><p>Mou wasn\u2019t quite clear on the exact situation. She just shook her head. Qin Guan sped up towards the office.</p><br/><p>It was silent inside the room. Wang Hailiang was sitting in his chair with Da Niu and another strong man standing behind him.</p><br/><p>A man was lying on his stomach on the floor. Alive or dead, nobody knew. Lily was in a white dress, squatting down beside him and sobbing. She looked like a pear blossom bathed in the rain.</p><br/><p>Wenwen was wearing red clothes, an infinite flirtatious expression on her face. She was standing nearby and watching the scene with pleasure.</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang was panting heavily as he stared at his favorite girl. Ever since Lily had come for an interview, he had fallen in love with her.</p><br/><p>She had been assigned to the sixth floor right from the beginning. She didn\u2019t have a tough time, nor did she have to drink wine with other guests, and she got paid just as much as a gaffer. She would also get gifts from Wang frequently.</p><br/><p>In his mind, he had treated her quite well, yet she had dared betray him with another man. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>People thought he was a tiger without teeth and paws ever since he had started a formal business.</p><br/><p>Lily kept crying, covering her face. Her slender shoulders were trembling. She tried to explain in a weak, helpless voice, \"Trust me, Brother Liang. I didn't betray you.\"</p><br/><p>Wang kicked a shelf right in front of her in a rush. \"B*tch! I\u2019m not blind anymore! If I was, it was only because of your butt and your talent in the shack!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw the clouds of misfortune gather above his head. Mou Xiaoliu is so stupid! Why did she ask me to come here? This is below me!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan noticed that the man lying on the floor was breathing. Nobody died. I can still run.</p><br/><p>Somebody wanted him to stay though. The sharp-eyed Wenwen had seen his attempt right away. She smiled and said, \"It's not my fault, Lily. Why did you do it? For money? Boss Wang is rich, and he\u2019s a passionate lover. I\u2019m really jealous of your luck.\"</p><br/><p>\"Was it for looks? That Adonis is nothing compared to Brother Qin. You should at least find a guy like Brother Qin if you\u2019re going to betray our boss.\" Thanks to Wenwen, Wang Hailiang noticed Qin Guan, who was about to run. He waved at him before turning to Lily. \"She\u2019s right! Look at my brother! That's a real Adonis! Now look at the idiot on the floor! This is insulting!\"</p><br/><p>His guards smirked. Boss, we rely on you to make a living. To tell you the truth though, that handsome guy could get any girl. Why would he take a fancy to your Lily?</p><br/><p>Wang\u2019s words inspired Lily, who wiped her tears away and looked at Wang with the most innocent expression. With quivering lips, she murmured, \"Why don\u2019t you trust me, Brother Wang? I have been with you for such a long time. You should know how moral I am by now...\"</p><br/><p>Wang felt an electric current shock his forehead.</p><br/><p>\"As you said, Brother Qin is way better. Whenever he was in your office though, I would leave right away. I have never said anything to him on my own initiative like Wenwen and the other girls. Never! That's a testament to my loyalty.\"</p><br/><p>Considering his limited cranial capacity and the electric current going through his head, Wang was muddled. He was thinking over the matter again. Did I treat her unjustly?</p><br/><p>Wenwen was calm. She had been spying on Lily for a long time ever since she\u2019d found out about the affair. She was well-prepared.</p><br/><p>Slowly, she said, \"Then how do you explain the scene just now? All the sisters in the club saw it.\"</p><br/><p>Lily's brain was functioning like crazy. Half-blushing and half-grumbling in a flirtish manner, she cast a glance at Wang and said sadly, \"I thought he was Brother Wang. He always liked role-playing. It was so dark in the room. Besides... Brother Wang, say something!\"</p><br/><p>Wang had calmed down. He was recalling all the role-playing games he liked best. She\u2019s right. It was so dark in that room that one wouldn\u2019t have been able to see their own hand. If the man didn\u2019t speak, Lily couldn\u2019t have known it was someone pretending to be me.</p><br/><p>He waved at his subordinates and said something in a low voice. The man on the floor was carried out.</p><br/><p>Lily glanced at the man fast without saying anything. Silence prevailed.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at Wenwen in confusion. She must have been the one who had orchestrated that drama. How had she caught Lily's lover though?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

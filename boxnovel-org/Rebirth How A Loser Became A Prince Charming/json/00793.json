He was not fond of greasy food.</p><br/><p>The child actor was looking at the chicken leg enviously. At his age, the small chicken leg was not enough to even fill the slits between his teeth.</p><br/><p>Du Chun malevolently thought that Qin Guan only ate with them because of the extra food. Actually, he was the person closest to the truth besides Wang Liying.</p><br/><p>Yes, to Qin Guan all the food portions were too small, so in a flash of inspiration, he had figured something out. A full stomach contributed to a better performance after all.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wiped his mouth and headed back to the set. In the next scene, Emperor Han Jing would dispatch some troops in an effort to crush the rebellion. Army provisions were necessary before an army set off though. Wars really cost a lot.</p><br/><p>If this were a war against the Huns, rich businessmen would have wanted to contribute. The emperor would pay them back afterwards after all. Unfortunately, this was an internal conflict, so if Emperor Han Jing lost the war, they would suffer a big loss.</p><br/><p>No one wanted to lend him any money, except for Tian Fen, who had to because he was a relative of the emperor. If the emperor was defeated, he would die miserably. He was a poor man without any money though, so he decided to steal something from his sister.</p><br/><p>He stole the priceless' jade bracelets and sold them, and then borrowed money from some businessmen. He bet everything he had on the emperor.</p><br/><p>People started gathering on the set, most of them attracted by the young award-winning actor. Du Chun and his agent were among them.</p><br/><p>\"Watch carefully. It's starting.\"</p><br/><p>As soon as the camera started filming, Qin Guan leaned against the back of a soft bed not far from his sister, stretching an evil hand out towards her jewellery box.</p><br/><p>\"Tian Fen!\"</p><br/><p>The sudden reproach scared him, making him pull his hand back immediately. He shot a surreptitious look at his sister, as if he was the survivor of a disaster. In an effort to cover up his guilt, he poured a cup of wine for himself.</p><br/><p>\"You are a man now! An adult! You can't just idle around the city. What are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Cheers!\" Qin Guan stuffed the bracelets into his pocket and lifted his cup. Concubine Wang couldn't help but ask him to leave.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan brought the character to life through his expressive eyes. His nervousness, secret satisfaction and indifference at being dismissed were expressed perfectly during the short scene. Tian Fen was a real person, not a cool symbol.</p><br/><p>The scene was finished in one take, so everyone left to prepare for the next scene. Du Chun was standing there alone, completely shocked.</p><br/><p>Is this his true ability? Is he even the same age as me? He is an experienced actor with his own performing style.</p><br/><p>Du Chun now saw the difference between them. He had been born to be an actor, so given a proper chance, he would reach the top of the world one day.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the young man began to rethink all his life and career choices.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that he had influenced another person in such a way. Without meaning to, his words had represented him and attracted the attention of all the prop masters of the circle.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his successful investment, Tian Fen became rich. He not only paid his debt back, but he also became one of the richest merchants in the city.</p><br/><p>When he did, he sent a case of foreign jewellery to Concubine Wang as a gift. Back then, foreign jewellery was rare in the palace. Any jewellery worn in court had to be brilliant.</p><br/><p>When the prop team used some fake jewellery that looked really bad on camera. Qin Guan couldn't help but comment, \"We could find a sponsor to lend us some jewellery. We would return it afterwards.\"</p><br/><p>\"But the jewellery is supposed to be from the Han Dynasty.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Wait a moment.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan certainly deserved the title of the best model in the domestic fashion circle. In half an hour, his firm had contacted several brands that sold antique jewellery. Diamond, which was one of them, had cooperated with Qin Guan at the jewellery fair.</p><br/><p>They also happened to have sent some antique designs to a foreign jewellery fair. Three sets of jewellery inspired by patterns of the Han Dynasty.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan called the director of Diamond and got the jewellery. In exchange, their logo would be added to the end credits and Qin Guan would become their ambassador.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

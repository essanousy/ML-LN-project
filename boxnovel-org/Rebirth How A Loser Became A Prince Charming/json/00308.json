For fear of being discovered, she stirred them with her chopsticks.</p><br/><p>Xuzhu returned disappointed and resumed eating his noodles. Chen Hao was observing his expression secretly from beside him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's eating manners made the crew hungry.</p><br/><p>\"Were his noodles cooked by our staff? They look delicious! We could have a good lunch here.\" Actually, Qin Guan felt like crying out when he tasted his noodles. They were terrible. As a picky foodie, noodles boiled in pure water were a disaster for him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was praying silently. I have to finish the scene in one take, or I\u2019ll have to eat two bowls of noodles.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was careful with his acting. Suddenly, he felt something strange in his mouth. He fixed his eyes on the food and saw that it was a piece of meat!</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" It felt like the sky had collapsed on his head.</p><br/><p>Chen Hao burst into laughter. \"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Director Zhang looked at her helplessly. They had not succeeded for lack of a final effort.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, everyone.\" Chen Hao didn\u2019t really feel ashamed. Laughing, she pointed at Qin Guan. \"I can\u2019t help it.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone around, including the actors who were in the scene, burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was lost in a daze. What's going on? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. A monk should be heart-stricken if they break a religious principle. I have to express that feeling before the audience.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, get some rest. We\u2019ll start over from this point later.\"</p><br/><p>His heart filled with sorrow, Qin Guan went out of the set with a grimace. I have to have one more bowl of noodles. I hope she won't laugh again.</p><br/><p>Somebody patted him on the back. Qin Guan turned around and saw Chen Hao. Curiosity and admiration were evident on her face as she asked him, \"Are you Qin Guan? The hot man online?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I am,\" Qin Guan answered honestly.</p><br/><p>Chen Hao softened her expression when she realized that the handsome guy had an even temper.</p><br/><p>Young men would disrespect their seniors when they became famous, and the girl automatically considered herself a senior.</p><br/><p>\"Well done!\" She patted him on the back again and left.</p><br/><p>It's you who got me into trouble! This is why Cong Nianwei always tells me not to try to reason with a woman.</p><br/><p>After getting some rest, Qin Guan felt like there was more space in his stomach.</p><br/><p>To avoid the same mistake, Zhang shifted the camera directly from the meat to Ding Cunqiu.</p><br/><p>After that adjustment, Xuzhu didn\u2019t come off as bold when the villain caught A Zi. Instead, he started trembling and hid inside the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang asked everyone to stop. That morning\u2019s work was finished. It was lunch time.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Qin Guan could rest in his room. He could walk around the base in his spare time.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Huang Bo was busy. He would be one of the members of the Constellation School.</p><br/><p>The special effect team was busy in the afternoon. The actors were fighting with each other, but the two main actors were free.</p><br/><p>Hu Jun and Lin Zhiying were wandering around the city with a small tail behind them. Liu Tao, the actor who portrayed A Zhu, was following Hu Jun everywhere like an assistant. Qin Guan was reminded of the gossip circulating among the crew. He cast a glance at Lin Zhiying. He is only helping the two of them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan whispered to Lin, \"Why do you stay with them?\"</p><br/><p>Lin spread his hands. \"I have to. Wang Jingcao and my agent are old friends. She asked me to take care of them and not leave them alone.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hu Jun is quite a straightforward man. He doesn\u2019t bother with insignificant things. Liu Tao is a green hand though. Even if you like somebody, you should never tell a reporter!\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder if the girl said it on purpose, or if she is just naive. She said that she loved Qiao Feng, and Hu Jun looks a lot like Qiao Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\"Plus, Wang Jingcao is familiar with Hu Jun\u2019s wife. You should understand Sister Wang's point of view.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

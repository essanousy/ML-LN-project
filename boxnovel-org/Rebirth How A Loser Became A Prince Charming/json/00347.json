The audience was laughing and applauding.</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao and Qin Guan went off the stage together. Everyone was making jokes about him.</p><br/><p> \"Grandpa, this is my friend from college, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took a bow. \"May your life be as long as pines and cranes!\"</p><br/><p> \"Thank you, boy,\" the old man said with a smile.</p><br/><p> \"Grandpa, this is a present from Qin Guan. It\u2019s really beautiful!\" Xu took out the small bottle proudly, as if it was his own present.</p><br/><p> Grandpa Xu looked at the small item carefully. It was not expensive, but it reminded him of times past.</p><br/><p> \"I like it. It's much better than the scratcher you got me.\"</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s a massage chair! You\u2019re biased!\"</p><br/><p> His father kicked him on the butt. \"What are you talking about? Go! You kids go play by yourselves!\"</p><br/><p> Xu made a face as he pulled Qin Guan away.</p><br/><p> \"My dad is always like this. I have nothing in common with those old men. Let's go hang out with people our age.\"</p><br/><p> Xu led Qin Guan to the wing hall, where all young boys and girls had gathered. It was much more fun there.</p><br/><p> \"Sir, the guests are all on the roof garden...\" the steward whispered to Xu Xiaoxiao.</p><br/><p> \"Let's go up to the roof. We\u2019ll have a drink in the New York night!\"</p><br/><p> The young men followed them up.</p><br/><p> The roof was American in style, as well as all the guests. There were white and black faces everywhere around them, unlike the yellow faces down in the hall.</p><br/><p> \"They are our business partners and friends. Of course, there are also several adventurers here...\"</p><br/><p> Xu winked at several hot girls like a womanizer. Qin Guan cast a supercilious look at him. \"Where is the food? Do you know what time it is?\"</p><br/><p> Xu struggled under Qin Guan's grip.</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s right there\u2026 Let me go!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan saw an acquittance by the table. He was in no mood to greet the guy though. He let Xu Xiaoxiao go and headed for the barbecue instead.</p><br/><p> Jones was surprised to see Qin Guan at the party. He had tried his best to get an invitation to the birthday banquet. He had even used his reputation as a top photographer.</p><br/><p> To be frank, he was just working there, taking nice pictures for the guests. He was hoping to expand his interpersonal connections that way.</p><br/><p> Xu\u2019s family was the largest Chinese family in New York, and they were very rich and powerful in Chinatown. How had a little-known Asian model qualified for an invitation to the banquet? Jones shuddered.</p><br/><p> Thank god I didn\u2019t play any dirty tricks on him, or I would have ended up in a garbage bag in the river the next day.</p><br/><p> The Xu Family were Chinese Freemasons [1], the largest branch of the Hip Sing Association. Although they had been whitewashed many years ago, they still maintained a relationship with the Chinese reactionary gang.</p><br/><p> The boy is really close to the third generation of the family!</p><br/><p> Jones drank a glass of champagne in one go to get over the shock.</p><br/><p> The atmosphere was perfectly harmonious on the roof. Grandpa Xu walked up the stairs slowly. On the small podium on the roof, the Mayor of New York was about to extend his own wishes for his birthday.</p><br/><p> After his speech, all the guests clustered around the old man, expressing their respect for the Asian big shot.</p><br/><p> He left after several routine greetings. Then the party began.</p><br/><p> Holding a hot girl, Xu Xiaoxiao walked up to Qin Guan, who was buried in food in the corner. \"Hey, dude. Don't focus only on the food. Look at Lily's friends over there! What do you prefer? Black, white or Asian?\"</p><br/><p> \"F*ck off! Cong Nianwei would kill me. You can have them all if you want...\"</p><br/><p> Meanwhile, a burly chap was heading upstairs, the wooden floor creaking under his feet.</p><br/><p>1.

It aimed to overturn the Manchu Sovereign and restore the Han Dynasty.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m a mass destruction weapon for animals. No wonder those two attacked me.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his work and got on a travelling bus with Cong Nianwei under the anxious gazes of their tutors.</p><br/><p>It was better to call their trip an adventure rather than an academic exchange. Talented students from different universities would get to know each other during the trip.</p><br/><p>The relationship between schoolmates was better than an ordinary friendship. With proper handling, it would help one a lot in the future. Besides, talented students from different industries would communicate with each other easier.</p><br/><p>Among all the celebrities from Columbia, it was Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei that attracted the most attention.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p> \"He always skips classes, yet he is still ranked at No. 1!\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s his girlfriend, Cong Nianwei!\"</p><br/><p>\"The female Asian Kong Kim who can pull off a whole design project by herself?\"</p><br/><p>\"She is different from the monster in the legend. She\u2019s a pretty girl!\"</p><br/><p> All the straight-A students on the bus were introverts. One could imagine how hard it was for them to recognize someone.</p><br/><p>On the back of the bus, led by Rongzhi, the students of the IT Department were staring at Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei like drooling idiots. They admired Cong Nianwei just as much as the boys at Tsinghua University.</p><br/><p>A female straight-A student, as pretty as a beauty in a cartoon\u2026 The trip would be perfect.</p><br/><p>Pink bubbles filled the bus. This was the first time Qin Guan was ignored like that. The tutor began to count everyone like a babysitter, when suddenly somebody started shouting outside.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I\u2019m coming!\"</p><br/><p>\"Come on! Let\u2019s go all over America!\"</p><br/><p>Sitting in his seat, Qin Guan recognized the guys without even looking at them. It was Lan Jin and Xu Xiaoxiao. The two bored guys were jealous of their summer camp trip. In order to enjoy a free vacation, they had decided to participate at their own expense.</p><br/><p>Columbia was one of the best universities after all. They kept shouting, but the tutor didn\u2019t even look at them. He finished counting the students and then shouted to the driver, \"Let\u2019s go!\"</p><br/><p>The bus had a lion print on it, which was the symbol of Columbia University. The vehicle roared as it headed to their first destination. Qin Guan noticed the car tailing after the bus. It was a large hummer with two girls and two boys inside. Xu must have called them.</p><br/><p>Before he could discuss it with Cong Nianwei, the tutor began talking.</p><br/><p> \"Our first stop will be Massachusetts. Do you understand?\"</p><br/><p>Understand what? As a foreigner, Qin Guan tried his best to recall the history of the state. Didn\u2019t American colonists slaughter nearly all the Indians? Doesn\u2019t Massachusetts have the finest spinning and weaving industry in America?</p><br/><p>Rongzhi craned his neck over, reminding them, \"It\u2019s an education-oriented state. Even its elementary school education is No. 1.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were enlightened. It sounded just like the Shandong, Hubei and Jiansu provinces in China. There was great pressure there.</p><br/><p>The tutor continued his speech.</p><br/><p>\"Our first stop is Harvard and the next one is MIT. They are in the same state.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan recalled his mischief with Harvard. The league game had been long ago, so he hoped that nobody remembered him.</p><br/><p>After three hours, they reached their destination. A Harvard professor with a foxy smile was waiting for them by the entrance.</p><br/><p>The two professors hugged each other warmly like old friends. Their greetings sounded strange though.</p><br/><p> \"Wow! The pig at the entrance always reminds me of the animals bred inside.\"</p><br/><p>\"According to an old Chinese saying, pigs can eat tigers. I think lions are the same as tigers.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan cast a look at the sculpture by the entrance. It was a pig\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\"Good news for you. We can teach all students well, even if they are pigs.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Do you mean that the world's richest and most intelligent men have been expelled by Harvard?\"</p><br/><p>The students followed them silently, entering the famous campus.</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoxiao and Lan Jin looked around them and asked Vivian and Liu Tianxia shyly, \"Shall we do it?\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s a disgrace. Besides, this is not Columbia.\"</p><br/><p>Vivian cast a supercilious look at him. \"That\u2019s why I want to do it. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have made such a long trip. I\u2019m busy during vacation.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

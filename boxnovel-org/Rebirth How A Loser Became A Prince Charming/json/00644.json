I'm a student from China. I would like to put on a performance for you by using the most ancient musical instrument. This will be the best example of Chinese music. I'll play some children's songs for you. I hope you'll like them.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a bow. A thunderous applause came from the audience. Everyone was really curious about the small, egg-shaped thing he was holding. It looked like a bun. Was it really some kind of musical instrument?</p><br/><p>Before the cameraman could capture all its details with his camera, Qin Guan put the instrument against his lips. The mysterious ancient instrument produced a clear tune.</p><br/><p>\"Oh! jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way... Oh, what fun it is to ride, in a one-horse open sleigh. Hey!\"</p><br/><p>The Americans were familiar with the first song, but they were surprised by the melodious tune. Qin Guan took a breath and shifted to the next song by pressing on different wind holes.</p><br/><p>\"There were three bears living together, Father Bear, Mother Bear and Baby Bear...\" It was a South Korean song. Although the audience was not familiar with the foreign lullaby, they could feel its joy.</p><br/><p>Children's songs were the best way to provoke playfulness in someone. Suddenly, Qin Guan switched to another tune.</p><br/><p>The Xun was the perfect instrument for expressing sadness.</p><br/><p>\"A little girl named Cabbage, lost her mother at a young age...\" [1]</p><br/><p>Qu and Lan were left speechless by the tune, while the Americans were lost in it.</p><br/><p>\"It sounds so sad... Is it talking about starving children?\"</p><br/><p>\"How moving! Qin Guan has prepared so well for the event!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's fabulous! I didn't expect such a small thing to play such beautiful music.\"</p><br/><p>\"I want to learn!\"</p><br/><p>\"Me too!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's performance unintentionally increased the sales of Chinese musical instruments. At the audience's request, Lan organized a music class in an effort to make even more money.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan finished his performance, he realized the audience was crying.</p><br/><p>\"That was so moving! It was beautiful!\" Americans liked to express their feelings openly.</p><br/><p>The host announced the end of the bazaar with tears in his eyes. The director wiped his own tears from his face and shouted at Qin Guan, \"Let's call it a day! Everyone has worked really hard!\"</p><br/><p>A staff member took a package of crushed cookies out of his pocket and shared it with Qin Guan's team. Everyone snatched the cookies up. They left one whole cookie for Qin Guan as a symbol of their love and appreciation.</p><br/><p>Thank you for your hard work, your understanding and approval...</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan visited the office of TIME Magazine with Qu Xuemei. The two of them waited for Linn.</p><br/><p>The door of the office opened and closed frequently as women of all ages walked by curiously. They were not there for Qin Guan. The influential magazine welcomed famous stars and VIPs from the political, economic and military circle every day.</p><br/><p>They just wanted to take a look at the guy Linn had invited. Linn was an icon admired among the photography circle after all.</p><br/><p>The chief editor was annoyed by the noisy environment. He was angry with his good-for-nothing staff. It was only an Asian star after all. They had taken pictures of many Asian stars in 2003.</p><br/><p>When the film \"Heroes\" had been in theaters in North America, they had put the four main actors, Zhang Ziyi, Liang Chaowei, Zhang Manyu and Li Lianjie, on the cover. At the time, people had had no idea who Qin Guan was. He had been a nobody who had only appeared in a film for a few minutes.</p><br/><p>The magazine had also hosted Jay Chou, who had caused a musical craze in Asia. His one-word comment on the cover had been \"Cool\"!</p><br/><p>\"Get back to work!\" the chief editor roared at the women.</p><br/><p>Linn heard his roar and walked over, leading his team directly to the chief editor's office.</p><br/><p>\"Is the studio ready?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! William, show him to the studio and let Qin Guan know that he can head to the dressing room!\"</p><br/><p>[1] A famous sad children\u2019s song in China.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

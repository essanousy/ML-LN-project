The noise from the sea and the sound of the seagulls had both disappeared.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's wicked friends were watching them from the counter in the distance. \"F*ck! They're holding hands!\" Zhou Jing said.</p><br/><p>\"Where are they? Where are they? Oh, I can see them!\" Li Jian shouted.</p><br/><p>\"They are so shameless, I can\u2019t\u2019 bear it! He put her hands on his chest!\" Zhou Jing again.</p><br/><p>\"Definitely a bad move!\" Li Jian said angrily.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's brain was operating at high speed as they looked at each other in deep affection. \"This feels excellent! Shall I take it to the next level? To do it or not to do it? I'll do it! There's nothing to be afraid of!\"</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of the harmonious scene and ambiguous atmosphere, Qin Guan lowered his head slowly, staring at Cong Nianwei with deep emotion.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! He lowered his head. Get out of the way! Will you move your big head? You're almost blocking them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop that rubbish. They're about to kiss! Don't disturb me, I don't talk to uncultivated people.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei\u2019s heads were moving closer and closer. The tall boy lowered his head gradually so their foreheads would touch. The exciting moment was finally there. Zhou Jing and Li Jian held each other's hands tightly, the veins on the backs of their hands popping out.</p><br/><p>They were getting closer. They were touching... Qin Guan's head suddenly moved away with a bang. His approaching cheek had been hit pitilessly by Cong Nianwei's head.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could hear the sound of his heart breaking. He would need a band-aid for both his jaw and heart. Cong Nianwei burst into laughter at the sight of the silly boy leaning back.</p><br/><p>Her heart was beating really hard as she touched her scalding cheeks with her hand. Her skin was still hot, and her heartbeat was violent. She hadn't meant to refuse. She had just been afraid that her heart would jump out of her mouth or her chest would be smashed by the heat as Qin Guan kept getting closer.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was terrified. She had never experienced such an uncontrollable impulse. What a simple girl! Time would teach her that this was what love tasted like.</p><br/><p>\"What happened? Ha, ha, ha...\"</p><br/><p>\"He was head-butted! Ha, ha!\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing and Li Jian, who had watched the whole scene, were laughing from behind the counter.</p><br/><p>\"I can't bear it! Qin Guan is so unlucky! Shall we tell this story to the commissary in charge of studies in our class?\"</p><br/><p>\"Better do it together!\" the two friends chimed in.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would have known what they planned on doing from their conversation. It was a pity that he was still lost in Cong Nianwei\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>Had he been hit hard? The blue sky, white clouds, wide sea and white waves composed the perfect background. What made the atmosphere ambiguous was their heartbreak and finger-crossed hands.</p><br/><p>Why did everything suddenly change just when I was about to make a move? Let\u2019s forgive Qin Guan. He was too careless to understand girls\u2019 thoughts. He couldn't do anything but look at Cong Nianwei blankly.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was a little embarrassed. Despite her nervousness, she pulled at the corner of Qin Guan's clothes with guilt.</p><br/><p>\"Are you hurt? I\u2019m sorry!\" Could you be any more sincere, girl?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came to his senses when he felt her pull at him. He massaged his jaw unconsciously as he replied, \"I\u2019m not hurt, I'm confused.\"</p><br/><p>\"Confused about what?\" Cong Nianwei looked at him nervously.</p><br/><p>\"You know, just now... Do you understand?\" Qin Guan was embarrassed. What shall I say? Chick, Master Qin wants to kiss you. Pucker up!</p><br/><p>If he'd said that, his life would have ended on that beach.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was a little embarrassed as well. She swung both her hands, which were still in Qin Guan's hands. \"I don't understand. Shall we keep walking?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed all depressing thoughts out of his head and gently pressed on her soft hand before he answered, \"Yes, let's go on.\"</p><br/><p>They idled along the beach again. The tide was surging in the morning, bringing plenty of seaweed, small fish and shrimp to the shallow waters. The sand underwater was softer. Their feet would sink into it, leaving a set of deep footprints. Occasionally, some small crabs brought by the water would get trapped in the pits of their footprints.</p><br/><p>As he watched the scene, Qin Guan's embarrassment was replaced by joy. He smiled at Cong Nianwei. \"You are a gifted student of the Department of Architecture. Come on, let's try to make a masterpiece! This is what they call painting with the sky and earth!\" (You are so uncultivated. Why did the author make you so calm?)</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was interested in Qin Guan's suggestion. She picked up a cobblestone from the sand and began to paint on the parts of the beach not flooded by the waves.</p><br/><p>Well done! The line is perfectly straight and the trapezoid is standard. This definitely explains why she's studying architecture. She's so skilful! Five minutes had passed, then ten, but Cong Nianwei wasn't done drawing yet.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was staring at her masterpiece in a daze, his arms crossed over his chest. It looks like a structured architectural design. So what if my girlfriend is a straight-A student? So what if she's drawing a design plan on our date? I\u2019ll wait for her.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was anxious, and Zhou Jing and Li Jian were quite worried. They followed the couple, hiding behind a small sand hill and burying their bodies into the sand to watch.</p><br/><p>Li Jian asked Zhou Jing curiously, \"You are closer to them. What is she drawing?\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing answered impatiently, \"She's drawing on the flat sand. I can't see!\" How slow those two are! The sun is rising high, and the visitors are getting more and more. Soon we\u2019ll be too busy to peep at them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't bear it anymore. He poked at Cong Nianwei from behind. \"It\u2019s not a masterpiece in my opinion.\" He wanted to take the cobblestone and set an example for her.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei, who was drawing sincerely, was annoyed. \"I'm almost finished, you troublemaker!\" she answered sullenly.</p><br/><p>\"Fine.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stopped at once and stood beside her patiently, waiting for her last stroke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They just narrowed their eyes and raised their eyebrows at the men.</p><br/><p>Who are they?</p><br/><p>The F4 and their agent didn't say anything.</p><br/><p>\"Let's be quick. It must be an official fan club organized by the government to welcome sports stars back to the country. Listen to me, these are all fake fans. They just do their job with no feeling... Why else would they be this orderly?\"</p><br/><p>The agent comforted the four boys, who nodded again and again. Suddenly, one of them looked back.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Sister, there must be another star behind us!\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiaotian, who was the most honest one among them, saw Pei Yongjun's team not far from them.</p><br/><p> They immediately slowed down and shot angry looks at the culprit.</p><br/><p>\"This is disgusting. South Koreans always act like they are royalty! Ha!\"</p><br/><p>Pei's group was cheered up by the crowd. They held their heads high with an arrogant, silly expression on their faces.</p><br/><p>\"Get out of my way!\"</p><br/><p>What are you doing? You are walking in a row in a broad hallway!</p><br/><p>\"Stop taking photos! Our Pei wants to have an ordinary life!\"</p><br/><p>Excuse me, but I don't see anybody taking pictures of you!</p><br/><p>Everyone was afraid, so they unconsciously pushed some girls close to the railing.</p><br/><p>Their actions were really provoking.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, bastard! Why did you push them?\" a bad-tempered young man exploded when he saw the girls getting bullied. Those guys were tentatively bullying the weak.</p><br/><p>The students took out their weapons, which included a wooden board and some flag poles.</p><br/><p>\"Who do you think you are, you son of a b*tch? How dare you challenge us here in Beijing! You have been spoiled by your silly fans, but we are not your f*cking fans! Piss off!\"</p><br/><p>\"Put down that trolley, Mou Xiaoliu! You've gone too far!\"</p><br/><p>Pei had never met such a group of people. He had originally planned on stopping his men when the fans started crying in disappointment. Then he would go over and give them an autograph or take a picture with them. That would set a good example for other South Korean stars.</p><br/><p>What the hell was happening though? There was a big number of weapons flying at them. Mom! This is terrible! I have to protect my face! I just got a nosejob a few days ago!</p><br/><p>His team realized that they had kicked a hornet's nest. Those bandits were not fans, they were enemies. The manager was the first one to be attacked. Covering his head, he pushed forward against them.</p><br/><p>\"Go! Go! Go! It's too dangerous!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>The four boys were laughing loudly. Their agent didn't stop them. Instead, she started cursing joyfully.</p><br/><p>\"You deserved that! You f*cking Koreans seized so many fans from us!\"</p><br/><p>The Koreans escaped down the hallway and saw the security guards standing silently behind those devils, as if nothing had happened. </p><br/><p>They felt insulted. The short manager reacted fast in an effort to save Pei's dignity.</p><br/><p>\"You bastards! We'll complain to your director! This is nonfeasance! We are foreigners. We should be under extra protection!\"</p><br/><p>If you knew you were foreigners, why would you behave so atrociously in someone else's domain? Unscrupulous laughter came from the students. They had to stay there for Qin Guan. Otherwise, they would have chased them and greeted them with the warmth of Chinese people.</p><br/><p>It felt good to see that someone was more miserable than they were. As the F4 were taking pleasure in the Koreans' misfortune, the students started shouting.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome home, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"We love you, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Who is Qin Guan?\" The name sounded familiar. The two parties looked around the hallway again.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei moved slowly with forced smiles. The students raised their flags and started shouting slogans, welcoming them home.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Their taste buds bloomed when they tried the hot, spicy soup. That dish was truly a food for powerful men.</p><br/><p>When one finished their dinner, they could shout at the happy owner again, point at the bamboo sticks mounted on the table and say, \"Count the sticks!\" This was a wonderful feeling. All the cells in one's body were clamouring, \"I'm a rich man!\" The owner knew that the guests had had a lot of food, but he was okay with that.</p><br/><p>Out of all Chinese cities, Chengdu attracted the most idlers. The pace of life there was so slow that it felt like a different world compared to other parts of China. The city was also a cradle of beauties, which matched its delicious food perfectly.</p><br/><p>I love the vast territory and abundant resources of China. I love the various races of Chinese people. I love my country!</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan boarded his return flight, the taste of chilli was still lingering in his mouth. Wang Liying, who was a very devoted girl, finished the handover.</p><br/><p>Unlike his busy team, Qin Guan was able to appreciate the row of fair legs before him. All the designers that had won the Chinese Costume Design Contest were sitting beside him. They had actually been sent by New Silk Road.</p><br/><p>After a friendly negotiation with the Paris Fashion Week, which was the most tolerant fashion event and the one that enjoyed the highest status and most global attention, the organizing committee had finally approved of Qin Guan's team.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew exactly what he had to do. The Paris Fashion Week was the best international fashion week. Milan and London favored native designers and were not that interested in foreign patterns, and New York was too commerce-oriented. Only Paris welcomed talented designers from all over the world.</p><br/><p>Designers from Japan and Taiwan had exhibited their designs on the stage in the past. That year, it was China's turn though. Qin Guan wanted to be the pioneer that would introduce traditional Chinese art to the world.</p><br/><p>The models had been selected from all over the country. All Chinese top model agencies and performing art companies had set aside their prejudices and private conflicts and sent their best models to the Paris Fashion Week.</p><br/><p>They had all been sent to the capital at the same time as Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>All the young men were looking at Qin Guan eagerly. The world-known top model, who was sitting on a couch under the stage leisurely, would be the one who would decide their destiny.</p><br/><p>Lv Yan and Du Juan, who had finished their work in New York and returned to China, were now sitting on either side of Qin Guan like loyal guardians. Because of the nature of the job, members of the Foreign Trade Department and the Textile Association, as well as representatives from the Designers' Association and other design institutes had also attended the meeting.</p><br/><p>The team, which was practically official, had united to help promote the Chinese fashion industry.</p><br/><p>As expected, Ye Dong had taken advantage of the situation to return to China. He had been appointed as the official spokesman and representative who would cooperate with Qin Guan. The man, who was aware of his own limits, pushed the burden on his old classmate as soon as he met him.</p><br/><p>\"I'm only your subordinate. At your service!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hit him on the chest. \"That's nonsense! What's your objective?\"</p><br/><p>Ye smiled meaningfully at him and adjusted his collar.</p><br/><p>\"I have to try to increase the popularity of Chinese textile exhibitors in Frankfurt. There will be an International Home Textile Trade Fair there, so I have to show the merchants the power of our government and get more orders for them. Our goal is to get international orders. You know that!\"</p><br/><p>F*ck! I didn't know, but the deal sounds pretty good! </p><br/><p>All the members of the Textile Association were delighted. The models on the stage looked as if a pie had fallen from Heaven and they all expressed their happiness over doing the job for free.</p><br/><p>Their sincere words came from their hearts. The journey to the fashion capital would be a great joy for both the models and the designers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

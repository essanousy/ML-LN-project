Then other countries had to pay five to six times the original price to buy the rights back. That was how strong Hollywood's industry and monopoly was.</p><br/><p>This particular film had borrowed material from a Croatian illustration created by famous artist Milan Trenc. The original had been an illustrated book for children. Hollywood businessmen had the unerring ability to spot a good opportunity, but this would also bring good luck to the book, to some extent.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had decided to interpret the story as a classic work of art and create the best fantasyland for children.</p><br/><p>The shooting site was like a small UN conference. People of different skin colors and ethnicities worked there. An assistant led Qin Guan to the director. The young man with the curly hair shook Qin Guan's hand excitedly.</p><br/><p>\"Nice to meet you. I thought you would be arriving later.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are so kind. I am never late, unless there is an emergency.\"</p><br/><p>\"Just head to the fitting room. We could film a simple shot so you can get a feel of the film.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, see you later.\"</p><br/><p>As he looked at the protagonist, Director Shawn Levy felt a little worried about Qin Guan's looks. He was afraid that he might distract the audience from the film.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan walked out of the fitting room though, the Canadian director gasped. The actor was wearing jeans and a T-shirt, the favorite outfit of the average American. His black jacket made him look decadent. He looked like a total loser.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, everyone!\" Shawn nodded at the old actress who would be participating in the scene. \"Get into position! Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would be portraying a father who had failed both at his personal life and work. His wife had divorced him, so he was living with his 10-year-old son. The pressure of life had forced him to give up his dreams. He had to find a steady job in order to keep custody of his son.</p><br/><p>Thus, he had appealed to the government for help. The bureau provided work opportunities for unemployed individuals. There, one could find information and job recommendations according to their work experience and educational background.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was looking for a job with a steady income.</p><br/><p>He was not humble by any means though. He was a talented high-tech developer after all. Although his search hadn't been successful, he still held on to his dream.</p><br/><p>He shared his dream with an employee who was as old as his grandmother.</p><br/><p>\"Debby? May I call you Debby?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stared at her with a charming, affectionate smile.</p><br/><p>\"The first time I saw you, I felt really nice. I thought you had felt the same way.\"</p><br/><p>Silence.</p><br/><p>\"Nope.\"</p><br/><p>This was the first time a heartbreaker like Qin Guan was getting rejected in a film. Plus, the woman was almost 60 years old.</p><br/><p>\"I really need to work. If I don't find the right job, I don't know what I'll do...\"</p><br/><p>A woman's maternal instinct usually increased along with her age. Qin Guan got an offer. Every person Debby had recommended for that job so far had failed to get it. She just asked Qin Guan to try his luck.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much.\"</p><br/><p>The short scene ended.</p><br/><p>\"Cut! Good!\"</p><br/><p>Shawn gave Qin Guan a thumbs-up.</p><br/><p>\"Take a break. The next scene will take place in the museum.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around and stretched his elbow towards Debby.</p><br/><p>\"May I lead the way for you, my lady?\"</p><br/><p>\"It would be my honor.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After Lu Chuan walked into the office, he closed the door considerately. I can achieve something else while I'm here. The director is a wordy man.</p><br/><p>Lu Chuan sat down comfortably on the familiar couch. The Wang Brothers greeted him.</p><br/><p>\"Did you hear the news? That's why you're here, right? We have already sent your film out.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Chuan bounced up from the couch.</p><br/><p>\"Which awards has my film been nominated for?\"</p><br/><p>\"The Tokyo Film Festival Award and the Taiwan Golden Horse.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? No Venice or Cannes?\"</p><br/><p>The Brothers wanted to hit him. Considering its special subject matter, Lu Chuan had originally limited his film to Asia and hadn't tried to promote it any further. Suddenly, he had seen the protagonist win an award in America though. He was really regretful about that, but it was too little too late. </p><br/><p>\"Listen to me! If you want an international award, you need to start preparing six months in advance. It's too late for you to cut in line now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't be so greedy. If you cut in line and gained nothing, everyone would be ashamed of you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Chuan was still unreconciled with the outcome, when the Brothers suddenly gave him the final blow.</p><br/><p>\"May I suggest you zip your pants up before starting an argument with us?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>It was a sad story, but c'est la vie. Every coin had two sides.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Director Chen Kexin was sitting at an ordinary cafe on Kowloon Street, laughing at a newspaper. The producer sitting across from him shared his feelings.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Qin Guan, Chen had gotten the chance to screen his film \"If, Love\" at the end of the Venice Film Festival. He had also received an invitation to the Queens Film Festival in New York.</p><br/><p>Before the Oscars, there had always been some inclusive American film festivals for actors, critics, producers and film distributors. Those festivals were able to judge the results of the Oscars in advance.</p><br/><p>Queens was not familiar with Asian people, but film insiders considered it one of the five festivals that decided the Oscar winners.</p><br/><p>The benevolent saw benevolence, and the wise saw wisdom.</p><br/><p>All filmmakers wanted to experience such an honor, so the award had a significant meaning. After Qin Guan's harvest, Chen Kexin looked forward to winning his own award. If my work was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar\u2026</p><br/><p>He wiped the saliva running down his mouth and shook his head, trying his best to come back to his senses.</p><br/><p>\"What did you say just now? I want to go to America. Qin Guan is there too, isn't he?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, his team told me that he would be staying in Los Angeles until the Oscars are over.\"</p><br/><p>Chen nodded and took a sip of his milk tea in disappointment.</p><br/><p>\"What's wrong with him? Other people are trying their best to stay in Hollywood, but he left for China. They actually gave him an award! Are there even any good scripts in China? An immature industry could ruin a good actor!\"</p><br/><p>The producer grimaced furtively. I know what you want to do.</p><br/><p>\"Should I persuade him to move his firm to Hong Kong?\"</p><br/><p>The producer tried to stop him immediately. \"You'd better not. It's said that he didn't return to China just for his film career. He is a certified public accountant in America with a doctorate from Columbia. As far as I know, his property in America and China can rival that of any rich man in Hong Kong. China's economic status is much better than Hong Kong's, except when it comes to the entertainment circle.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Li Jian had gotten a small shelf like that from a wholesale merchant and hung the packages on it.</p><br/><p>The customers turned their eyes to the swimsuits. \"These swimsuits look so nice.\" A young girl walked to the shelf to feel the material of the suits. \"Ah, it\u2019s seersucker. It\u2019s the most popular style this year. I haven't bought it in time.\" Then she asked them surprisingly, \"Are there any other styles?\" Qin Guan pouted at Zhou Jing, \"Serve the lady.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing hastened to take out all the swimsuits from the bag as he began to talk about them, \"Look at this one, isn't it bright?\" Meanwhile, Li Jian was selling soda water. \"Hey, young man, are you thirsty? Have a bottle of water. Thanks, it's one yuan per bottle. Take it.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan introduced the swimming rings to the swimmers, \"No matter the size, they all cost 5 yuan per hour. The deposit is 20 yuan. All the rings are made of rubber, and they 're absolutely safe.\"</p><br/><p>When the wave of visitors had finally left, Li Jian had sold five bottles of soda water, earning a profit of 2.5 yuan, Qin Guan had rented two circles and an umbrella, earning a 60 yuan deposit, and Zhou Jing had sold a swimsuit and a pair of three-corner pants, earning a 42 yuan profit. It was a good beginning.</p><br/><p>It was a busy day with many small deals. They sold soda water and frozen suckers now and then. Y city hadn't been developed at the time. There was no massive flow of customers like there would be in the future, when the people on the crowded beach would look like dumplings in boiling water. The whole day, they had sold four swimsuits for ladies, which had been their best sale, four suits for kids and two pairs of swimming trunks for men.</p><br/><p>They had made a 198 yuan profit from the swimsuits, 130 yuan from renting the rings, and 38.4 yuan from the soda water and frozen suckers. All the soda water had been sold out. It seemed that the frozen suckers, which were the most popular among the tourists, made the least profit. They were still the key to attracting customers though. It was better than nothing, wasn't it? Their total profit for the day was 366.4 yuan, which made Zhou Jing and Li Jian quite happy.</p><br/><p>They deposited the freezer, swimming rings and umbrellas in the ticket booth before leaving and gave the woman 10 suckers as a gift for her kid.</p><br/><p>They returned home happily. Even though they lacked experience, the soda water had been sold out by noon. They'd have to buy more for next time.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Zhou Jing would make the replenishments and give the money to his aunt. They needed more half-length suits. Both the half-length suits selected by Qin Guan had been sold out.</p><br/><p>It was just the beginning of July. Peak time for touring would be in middle July. Many tourists within the province liked to enjoy a leisurely holiday on the beach of Y city, so it would be the best time for sales.</p><br/><p>The rings were enough for now. They would double them by the middle of July though. It was worth reusing them at the price of 10 yuan each.</p><br/><p>They also had to get three deck chairs the next day. They could rent them to anyone who was interested or lie on them themselves. After a whole day of standing, Qin Guan's legs felt stiff, and so did his friends'. Delighted by that day's harvest, they rode the tricycle to the urban area under the moonlight. They hadn't eaten the whole day. Dinner was of great importance.</p><br/><p>They planned to have a good meal at the Mother Wang Wonton Pancake Restaurant.</p><br/><p>People said that the stomach was just like a pocket and the mouth was like a hometown. All the flavors tasted during one's childhood, sour, sweet, bitter and spicy, were the original elements of their life. Like their genes, they would accompany them till the end of their life. Both in Qin Guan's past and present life, wonton and pancake would always remind him of the fragrance between his teeth and cheeks.</p><br/><p>The Mother Wang Wonton Pancake Restaurant was a small restaurant in a hutong of the residential area. Under the small shop sign, there were the characters for \"pancakes\" and \"wonton\" on the door and windows. The cooking counter was outside the restaurant. There were only three tables in the room, which could sit more than ten customers. The owners were a mother and son, who were both kind and polite to customers. Despite the simple conditions, the prices were quite reasonable, so the place was popular among students and workers in the area.</p><br/><p>When they arrived, they said hello to the boss, parked their tricycle, and entered the room. They asked for one bowl of wonton and two pieces of pancakes each, plus a dish of cucumber in sauce.</p><br/><p>The dishes were served fast. Soon, two bowls of hot wonton were on the table. The bowls were made of high-end, blue-white porcelain. With their extremely thin skin and little pork, the wontons looked like crystal. There was a layer of bright yellow egg, as well as chopped green onion and caraway floating on the surface of the soup. The boss had scattered several drips of sesame oil and pepper powder on the soup before serving it to increase the customer's appetite.</p><br/><p>The word \"pancake\" referred to different things in different places. Pancakes in Y city were fried in a pan with peanut oil and chopped green onion. The most important thing about a pancake was how many layers it had. The more and softer they were, the better.</p><br/><p>The pancakes of that restaurant were authentic. Both sides were yellow and crispy. When they hung softly from one's chopsticks, they became loose. The boys ate pancakes and cucumber to their heart's content, sweating heavily in the hot summer as they returned home happily. They had paid 5 yuan each.</p><br/><p>With gold in their pockets, they felt no panic. Qin Guan had no idea about his wicked friends\u2019 dreams that night. He had a good dream himself. The next morning, he could still feel the aftertaste of the meal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Is that why the chief editor knows you and asked you for help?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to weep, but was unable to produce any tears. Huang Jiajia, you are so clever and to the point! Why don't you use that IQ during your lessons? Looking at her shining eyes, Qin Guan decided to tell her.</p><br/><p>Opening her new textbook at random, he answered calmly, \"I signed a contract with New Silk Road, and my agent sent me to a competition to have a try. I won accidentally.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt that was a complete answer, and so did Huang Jiajia. I know more about him now. What shall I do? He looks even more attractive to me.</p><br/><p> It took Qin Guan more than 10 minutes to comfort her. Then he organized his thoughts and tapped the textbook with his pen. \"So much for chatting. Let\u2019s start our lesson. We'll begin with Math.\" The first class of the new semester was relatively simple. Qin Guan helped Huang Jiajia with the new knowledge points of the book and asked her to practice.</p><br/><p>Then he looked at his watch and realized that half the time had passed. While she exercised, he read his own textbook and relaxed.</p><br/><p> Ever since he had returned to college, Qin Guan had been really busy. He was slightly ashamed for boasting to his student before he had even showed off to his roommates.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sleepy. My eyes are closing. Despite his tough mind, Qin Guan fell asleep while he read his book.</p><br/><p>When Huang Jiajia finished her exercises and looked up, she found him leaning against her bed in a reading posture, using the teddy bear under his body as a pillow.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia smiled before standing up carefully and sneaking up to the bed. Qin Guan\u2019s mouth was open, and saliva was dripping out. His hair covered his face softly, shaking with his breath.</p><br/><p> Huang Jiajia touched him with a barrette, which shook slightly as it scratched his face. Qin Guan frowned, but didn't wake up. Huang Jiajia stepped forward and sat on the bed, craning her neck toward Qin Guan's face.</p><br/><p>It was a perfect face, with smooth skin, dashing eyebrows, a high nose, and thin lips. His beautiful eyes were shut beneath his long eyelashes. That handsome face must have charmed numerous girls! At the thought that she was one of them, Huang Jiajia felt wronged.</p><br/><p> I know that he has a girlfriend, but I can't get him out of my mind. If I don't have something that belongs to him, I\u2019ll be devastated. In her imagination, she was the heroine in a tragedy and a dissatisfied girl in a boudoir. Stop, you drama queen!</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia smiled as her lips approached Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Both their faces were red, his from sleep and hers from nervousness. Her lips were getting closer and closer, like a pink rose in early puberty. Right before touching his skin, the rose suddenly bloomed open. \"Qin Guan! Get up!\" Huang Jiajia shouted by his ear.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan got up dizzily, his ears ringing and his saliva finally falling off. \"Eh, that's disgusting!\" Huang Jiajia took out her handkerchief to wipe his mouth.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was still dizzy. Who the hell would wake up their teacher in such a way? I shouldn't treat the naughty child kindly!</p><br/><p> He massaged his swelling head and felt his ear go back to normal. It\u2019s late, let's call it a day. Then he stood up and knocked on Huang Jiajia's head. \"Call me sir. That's it for today. Remember to review the course. I\u2019ll check your exercises when I return next week.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia ground her teeth as she covered her head. That's twice you've hurt me today. I\u2019ll pay you back.</p><br/><p> Then she saw Qin Guan off. Before he left, Huang Jiajia said in front of her mother, \"Teacher Qin, take me to Carrefour when you come back.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stopped as Huang showed off before her mother. \"Mum, Teacher Qin will treat me. Tell me if there's something you want us to get for you.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was the best choice for Qin Guan, who always carried a pile of scripts everywhere.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the other two scripts in the bag, which he always ignored. After a pause, he picked one of them up.</p><br/><p>Before he turned the cover over, he heard of a familiar voice. \"Qin Guan? What are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>The man behind the bar counter was supporting his jaw with his hands, appreciating the beautiful scenery by the window. Three beauties of different styles were looking at the most handsome customer he had ever served.</p><br/><p>Yin Yan spoke first. She was meeting Qu Xuemei and Liu Yan there to hear their news. Little did they know that they\u2019d meet their favorite model there.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? What a coincidence!\"</p><br/><p>Confused, Qin Guan greeted them. They are rivals. Why are they meeting here?</p><br/><p>Wary of the potential trouble, he decided to escape. \"I just finished work. Don't bother treating me. I\u2019m leaving.\"</p><br/><p>\"Take your time. In fact, the matter at hand has something to do with modelling. You\u2019d better get a general idea.\"</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei blocked his way.</p><br/><p>The other two nodded. \"Yes, it'd be good for you.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't do anything but pull out chairs for the three girls. The bar owner served them instead of the waiter. It was his pleasure to see such beauties up close.</p><br/><p>They took their seats. The steam rising from the cups added warmth to the deep autumn.</p><br/><p>\"There is a scandal within the industry. The chief director of \u2018Fashion\u2019 will take the blame and resign after the Spring Festival.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nearly fell off his chair upon hearing the news.</p><br/><p>He had cooperated with \"Fashion\" for an inside spread. Several months earlier, the editor had contacted Sister Xue, but she had sensed something strange and made up an excuse for Qin Guan to turn down the offer.</p><br/><p>The three women all had their poker faces on as they talked about the editor\u2019s tragic fate.</p><br/><p>\"She chose that path herself. She's only a scapegoat anyway.\"</p><br/><p>\"She already had an important role in the domestic fashion industry. What was she really after?\"</p><br/><p>\"She was implicated with that female star. The one with the military flag, right?\"</p><br/><p>They paused there and drank their coffee.</p><br/><p>Qu put her cup down and looked at Qin Guan, \"You should deny any offers from them for the next six months. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. He was clear about his priorities. He had heard from Wang Jingcao that CCTV and the government would also force the female star out. According to inside information, it would be a long time for her.</p><br/><p>The three queens asked Qin Guan to leave so they could discuss their official responses.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan scampered off like a frightened rat. Noting the jealous expression in the bar owner\u2019s eyes, he paid for the three queens\u2019 drinks.</p><br/><p>When he got to the parking lot, he called Sister Xue. 2001 was an eventful year for the entertainment and fashion circle, but it was a productive year for Qin Guan. He was President Qin.</p><br/><p>President Qin was currently cleaning his house like a poor servant. Cong Nianwei had sent him home, because she had discovered that the room was covered in dust.</p><br/><p>He was fighting with the dust on the floor when Sister Xue called him back. It was time for him to get down to business.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hurried to the Citizen Public Relations Department. At the time, Citizen had begun to promote Qin Guan's autographed copy of the album to fans in Asian countries.</p><br/><p>The buyers of the album would find an elegant postcard inside the package, as well as instructions on how to apply for the signed copy.</p><br/><p>They could send the card back to Citizen to apply. If they were selected, the organizer would send them the instructions and charge them.</p><br/><p>Only few Asian countries would get the chance to get a copy. Citizen would cover all the expenditures.</p><br/><p>Fans would not just be able to see their idols, but also visit a new country. It would be a wonderful chance for them.</p><br/><p>Admissions were rare though. There were only 20 in some Asian countries, so some fans paid a high price in order to qualify.</p><br/><p>Some girls who shared an album fought with each other when sending the postcard.</p><br/><p>Their friendship came to an end thanks to the magazine.</p><br/><p>\"Let me go!\"</p><br/><p>\"You let me go! You are shameless! You sent the card out secretly with your own name!\"</p><br/><p>\"I paid more than you. The album is mine!\"</p><br/><p>\"The collection belongs to both of us! You are so cunning!\"</p><br/><p>The two of them wrestled. They were lucky in the end, as they both got the chance to participate in the activity.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

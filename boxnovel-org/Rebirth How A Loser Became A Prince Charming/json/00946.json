You are still a novice compared to me.</p><br/><p>Unsurprisingly, when the new development in the conflict between Chou and Chen was published, it attracted a lot of attention. Everything changed for Chou in America, just like Qin Guan had predicted. Strange news started sprouting like mushrooms after the rain.</p><br/><p>The old gossip about Chou and Jolin was revisited.</p><br/><p>\"Is Jay Chou still in love with Jolin Tsai?\"</p><br/><p>\"Jay was bitter about his ex-girlfriend's success.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The fans were distracted. Chen was certainly capable at marketing and fabricating news. News emerged endlessly in the entertainment circle, so it was impossible to change the unspoken rules of the music circle by drawing attention to and investigating ordinary people.</p><br/><p>Music awards, album sales and chart lists had nothing to do with the everyday lives of common people, as those people focused on their livelihood instead of on such scandals.</p><br/><p>Actually, Chinese people were tolerant when it came to incidents like that. If this had happened in America, the singer would have been abandoned by their fans and boycotted by companies. Their album sales would also have decreased dramatically, forcing them out of every channel and TV station.</p><br/><p>This was the attitude of every music insider, as well as a way to preserve justice and maintain a fair atmosphere.</p><br/><p>To Chinese people, music was nothing but entertainment. In Europe and America though, it was a painstaking collective achievement, an inspiration outlet for composers and the dream of every singer. It was the soul of personal and artistic expression, and as such, it could not be faked or insulted. </p><br/><p>Naturally, everyone was soon overwhelmed by other gossip. Jay Chou fell silent. He had imagined so many possible endings, both successful and unsuccessful ones. He had even been prepared to defend himself long-term.</p><br/><p>However, the whole incident came to a silent, unexpected end. Nobody paid any more attention to it. Indifference was the biggest, deepest sorrow.</p><br/><p>Chou didn't resign himself to this outcome though. Instead, he made another try. He published a long letter on his blog, appealing to everyone to pay attention to and regulate such improper behavior.</p><br/><p>He had even thought about taking legal action, but he failed to find a specific law that applied in Taiwan.</p><br/><p>His efforts showed his good faith, so he was able to convince more and more people that he had not acted out of personal emotion or benefit.</p><br/><p>In a few days, he received thousands of responses to his letter.</p><br/><p>\"We are on your side!\"</p><br/><p>\"We need such thought-provoking opinions.\"</p><br/><p>\"This can't go on!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Zeshan threw the newspaper onto his desk angrily.</p><br/><p>\"I have to figure out a way to make the media and the public forget about this completely. I need some striking news... Bingo!\"</p><br/><p>Another conspiracy would soon be revealed.</p><br/><p>All Qin Guan could do was express his support for Chou through his blog. NBC's talent show \"Project Runway\" was waiting for him.</p><br/><p>The program's authenticity and extreme cruelty captivated the viewers' hearts immediately.</p><br/><p>Although most people knew nothing about fashion or design, anyone with good taste could get obsessed with the show. Each viewer selected their favorite contestant and got excited about their work like a loyal fan.</p><br/><p>The audience would become the first group of customers after the designers started their own careers.</p><br/><p>Every step of the competition was planned carefully.</p><br/><p>For example, the competition was held at the Parsons School of Design in New York, which was famous for its professional studios, sophisticated concepts and impeccable tailoring equipment. It was the best school in the fashion circle.</p><br/><p>In addition, the contestants stayed at the Atlas Department right next to the school, which showed how dedicated they were to winning.</p><br/><p>Those perfect conditions and considerate arrangements helped create the successful show.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

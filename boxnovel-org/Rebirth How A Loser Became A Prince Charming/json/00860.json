Fan Pingping walked closer to him. \"What's this? You're reading it so carefully.\"</p><br/><p>\"Director Li An sent it to me. It's quite controversial. I'm still hesitant about it.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is it? Let me take a look.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan handed the script over. The title on it was \"Lust Caution\".</p><br/><p>Unlike all the characters he had portrayed before, this one was a traitor, the ultimate villain. Qin Guan was hesitant because he was afraid the SARFT might get upset.</p><br/><p>Fan changed his mind though.</p><br/><p>\"An actor like you can do anything without regrets. A good script comes to you by luck, not by searching for it. You can pick and choose from many though! You can try all kinds of roles. I'm going to go mad!\"</p><br/><p>She is right. I have never portrayed such a villain. One should be open to challenges. If I get in trouble for this film, I could find work in America and wait for the storm to subside. That's what I'll do!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt determined. After escorting Fan out, who was still feeling reluctant about her own script, he told Wang to arrange his upcoming work schedule. He would talk about the details with Director Li An before the Ornamental Column Awards. If he rejected such a chance again, the director might not give him another one in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan contacted Qu and asked her to get more foreign scripts, just in case.</p><br/><p>As award ceremonies were coming up one after the other, Qin Guan calmed down from his previous excitement. A possible award might please him, considering that he had not been very passionate lately.</p><br/><p>Attending ceremonies became a routine for him. A train rarely experienced any surprises when it followed the tracks. There was an obscure feeling at the bottom of his heart reminding him of his own ambition and long-term goals.</p><br/><p>He would not rest until he won an Oscar. Thus, Qin Guan decided to try to realize his dream. Feature films were still popular at the Oscars after all.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stomped confidently on the red carpet of the Ornamental Column Awards in his most solemn suit.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Golden Chicken and Hundred Flowers Awards, the Ornamental Column Awards were very serious. Their original name had been \"Excellent Government Film Awards\". Such an award was an honor bestowed by the government, so all the films selected for the next round focused on ideology and art, instead of on succeeding at the box office, selling DVD copies and making their money back.</p><br/><p>The award was a miniature of the real ornamental column on Tienanmen Square, which indicated its political significance.</p><br/><p>That award was a certificate of quality.</p><br/><p>Although it was the most popular one among ordinary people, it was definitely the most important award for the Chinese cultural industry. As a result, all the nominated actors attended the ceremony. No one dared to be absent, for fear that the directors of the Ministry of Culture would attend the event and get a bad impression of them.</p><br/><p>Yin Changtao had designed a custom traditional Chinese suit for Qin Guan, which was even better than an Armani suit. Giorgio Armani had showed great interest in the outfit, as this was the first time Qin Guan had declined to wear Armani at a formal event.</p><br/><p>It was a Chinese tunic suit with an open collar and fitting pant legs that revealed Qin Guan's perfect figure. He looked extraordinary amid the crowd on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>There were also some international stars coming from far away, including Zhou Xun, Zhang Ziyi, Jet Li and Leon Lai, who had to remind the officials of their existence.</p><br/><p>They attracted the attention of the media, upstaging older hard-working actors.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could take a seat, he saw Feng Gong grin at him. He shared a bitter hatred with him over a common enemy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

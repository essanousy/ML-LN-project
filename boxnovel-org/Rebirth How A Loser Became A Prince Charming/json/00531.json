He could only choose between jeans and T-shirts. This was neither the Armani backstage area, nor the Fashion Week fitting rooms.</p><br/><p>After pondering it for a long while, the stylist picked out a light blue shirt for Qin Guan. The rest of the crew were casting supercilious looks at him.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan put the clothes on though, they all held their breath.</p><br/><p>The director began filming nervously, complaining to the stylist for dressing Qin Guan so nicely. It was hard enough for the heroine to control herself already.</p><br/><p>As soon as the camera started rolling, Qin Guan became soft and gentle.</p><br/><p>\"Will you come to the party tonight?\" he asked Katie with a tentative smile. He seemed uncertain about inviting her. His long arms were lying on the desk between them.</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" the girl answered happily.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked down. Then he looked up again with determination. \"Don\u2019t bring any other boys.\"</p><br/><p>What would you think of that?</p><br/><p>The most popular boy in school had given a love letter to his favorite girl. What could she do but rush up to him?</p><br/><p>This was how Lindsay felt. She was so absorbed in his smile that she didn\u2019t hear the director or notice Qin Guan leaving. She kept giggling in the empty classroom.</p><br/><p>The other actresses couldn't stand her anymore.</p><br/><p>They were the same age and just as beautiful as Lindsay was, but she was the heroine and they had to play the scheming b*tches. It was unfair!</p><br/><p>They were jealous that she was Qin Guan\u2019s partner! This was a dream shared by all young girls. As a result, they isolated Lindsay.</p><br/><p>\"Please! You are an actress! Act like a professional!\"</p><br/><p>\"You are at work! Stop drooling!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't scold her. Maybe she really wants to interact with Qin Guan. Daydreaming is not a crime after all.\"</p><br/><p>The three blonde girls glanced at Lindsay with a scornful expression in their eyes and then left laughing.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, she came back to her senses. \"Huh? Did I hear someone laughing just now? I have no idea what happened. I\u2019m hungry...\"</p><br/><p>The girls\u2019 efforts had been in vain.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a strange scene was taking place at the school cafeteria, where the crew was dining. There was a big empty space around Qin Guan. No one except Qu dared sit by him. The principal made an attempt, but retreated when he saw the angry looks the girls were giving him.</p><br/><p>As a latecomer, Lindsay was fearless. Not paying attention to the girls around her, she sat down across from Qin Guan, took her hamburger in her hands and fixed her eyes on him.</p><br/><p>The beautiful guy, who was a feast for the eyes, made the unsavoury food seem delicious. Qin Guan was speechless. He felt uncomfortable to be thought of as a snack.</p><br/><p>The three girls rescued him by gesturing silently at him, hinting that he could leave. Then they came and sat down across from Lindsay.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, look at me! Finish your hamburger before you leave. Don\u2019t I make your food taste good too?\" Karen whispered to Lindsay ferociously.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t lose face, girl! Keep eating...\"</p><br/><p>Karen nodded at Venus, who picked up a fork and ground it against the table.</p><br/><p>The sound was terrible. The whole scene was like a real-life \"Mean Girls\".</p><br/><p>Stupefied, Lindsay nodded like a robot. Satisfied at her victory, the female janitor appeared behind them.</p><br/><p>She stretched a large palm out to them and said loudly, \"The president is right! Actors are always breaking the law. You like destroying everything! Wait till I catch you! Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>\"You have to pay 20 dollars. You damaged the table!\" The woman was actually a spy.</p><br/><p>Their agent took out some bills. You are losing money before even making it, princesses!</p><br/><p>The school reminded everyone of their own student life as they expressed themselves, showing their true colors.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

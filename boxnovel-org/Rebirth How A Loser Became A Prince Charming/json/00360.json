He pulled Qin Guan over and threatened him. \"Can you dance? Tell me! If you say no, I\u2019ll kill you!\"</p><br/><p>So I basically have to say yes? Qin Guan gave in to his threat. \"I know what you mean. I can! I can!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pulled his tie off and pushed it at Xu Xiaoxiao. Then he unfastened three buttons on his shirt.</p><br/><p>He bowed before Cong Nianwei and extended his hand. \"Would you please dance with me, my beautiful princess?\"</p><br/><p>It would be their first dance with a real meaning. He had to make it perfect for the sake of their new life together.</p><br/><p>Other Chinese students applauded. They liked that boy, even though he did everything in a showy way.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei smiled and gave Qin Guan her hand. Suddenly, he threw his suit jacket high in the air. The blue Ports jacket landed in Xu's hand after a handsome parabola.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin whistled excitedly. The Chinese students applauded loudly.</p><br/><p>The competitors on site saw the commotion. Before they could come back to their senses, the boy in the white BOSS shirt and his female partner walked to the dancing floor. Qin Guan looked like a returning King.</p><br/><p>They naturally left the center of the stage to the contestants. Most of the dancers stopped and walked away. They chose to watch the competition from afar.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin and the other guys were confident about Qin Guan. What they were worried about actually was Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>Bright music started playing. Cong Nianwei\u2019s beautiful crystal high-heels were shining. She moved in a handsome twirl, the two of them beginning their performance.</p><br/><p>They were dancing cha-cha, which was the best choice for lovers who wanted to show off. Following Cong Nianwei's rhythm, Qin Guan swayed his hips in a sexy manner. He looked perfect in his tight pants.</p><br/><p>\"Oh my! I can\u2019t even breathe!\"</p><br/><p>Cheers from foreign girls were heard all around them. Qin Guan was like a flame lighting up the whole hall.</p><br/><p>Love and romance were the pride of youth. They looked at each other, exchanging hot, emotional looks.</p><br/><p>They provoked each other, their breaths full of hidden sexual passion.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's fair legs were locked around Qin Guan\u2019s. They tangled and parted, expressing their love.</p><br/><p>They fixed their eyes on each other, stars shining in their pupils. They only saw their own reflection in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The music gradually slowed down, perfectly matching their steps.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's serious expression suddenly changed. A warm, honest smile formed on his face.</p><br/><p>Hand in hand, they waved to the audience and bowed amid the applause. The other dancers were totally ignored.</p><br/><p>It was the first time John, Wendy and Susanna, their striking fellow students, experienced what being a fly on the wall was like. </p><br/><p>When they noticed the dispirited expression on their rivals\u2019 faces though, they were relieved. At least our rivals also failed to win the title.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin applauded so much that his palms turned red. He didn\u2019t forget to share his pride with Xu Xiaoxiao, who was also crazy about the dance competition.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan realized that he and Cong Nianwei had become popular after their dance. After the party, students would come up to them to greet or talk to them.</p><br/><p>The harmonious atmosphere reached its peak during the award ceremony. The lights became dim, leaving only two projectors shining dazzlingly down at the center of the stage.</p><br/><p>The host mounted the small stage and shouted the names of the prince and princess of the ball.</p><br/><p>\"The princess is a Chinese student from the Department of Civil Engineering, Cong Nianwei...\"</p><br/><p>\"And our extraordinary prince is...\"</p><br/><p>As he was about to say the name, all the Chinese students in the hall shouted loudly, \"Qin Guan! Qin Guan! Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Bingo! He is also a Chinese student from the Finance Department, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>The lights were suddenly cast in their direction, their shadows getting tangled up and forming a beautiful halo. Hand in hand, they walked forward slowly in a graceful manner.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

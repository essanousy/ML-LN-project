Fortunately, there were few tourists in Basel. If this had been in China...</p><br/><p>Some European tourists even slept on the grass in the daylight as the Chinese couple was searching for food. Following their sense of smell, the two foodies reached their first destination.</p><br/><p>Good wine needed no referrals. There was a big piece of candy wrapped in paper by the entrance with the Swiss national flag printed on it. The scent was coming from a common shop. People could watch the bustling scene through the large windows.</p><br/><p>The small shop sold handmade candy. People always thought of chocolate and forgot about candy. In fact, chocolate was only one category of candy.</p><br/><p>The fat boss had typical Swiss blonde hair and blue eyes and was wearing a white chef uniform and gloves. He took a large iron tray from the air-drying shelf and put it down on the table with a bang.</p><br/><p>Outside the window, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei exchanged a glance and then pushed in. The doorbell jingled happily.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome... Pick what you like...\" the boss told them in his poor English. Then he got absorbed in the candy that came fresh out of the oven.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks. We\u2019re just taking a look,\" Qin Guan said in standard German. I love you, Joseph.</p><br/><p>The man looked up in surprise. They are Asians, yet they can speak German.</p><br/><p>\"What's the problem? If my memory serves me right, German is an official language of Switzerland...\" Qin Guan murmured before switching to Italian.</p><br/><p>The boss rushed to explain. \"It's okay, I was just surprised. Asian visitors usually speak English. I didn\u2019t expect you to speak German.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei smiled at each other. The boss made a cut with his knife.</p><br/><p>They were an elegant Chinese couple. The girl was delicate and pretty, her eyes as clear as a brook in the suburbs. As for the boy... His poor education made it hard for him to express his feelings, but the boy reminded him of the powdered sugar his father used to give him as a present when he had been a child. He used to dip his little finger into it to taste it.</p><br/><p>When he came back to his senses, he didn\u2019t regret the cut. After some consideration, he managed to cut the soft candy into two thumb-sized figures.</p><br/><p>\"A sample for you.\"</p><br/><p>The man stared at Qin Guan\u2019s face with an unprecedented flattering smile, holding a tray in his fair hands.</p><br/><p>\"This figure is you. It's pretty, isn\u2019t? That one is your girlfriend. I\u2019m don\u2019t want to boast, but my products are the best in Switzerland.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei looked speechlessly at the two lovely candy figures. Should we eat them or not? Is it okay to eat yourself?</p><br/><p>As two foodies, they couldn't resist the temptation. They stuffed them into their mouths.</p><br/><p>The elastic candy was easy to bite into. It tasted like plum, yellow peach and butter. The soft candy was made in the oven and dried in the air of the Rhine. Its unique sugar made it a delicious food of the mortal world.</p><br/><p>It tasted sour, sweet, salty\u2026 The candy was like a human life.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei swallowed it with sparkling eyes. Then they began shopping like crazy.</p><br/><p>The boss was shocked. They seemed to pick up all the products from the shelves. The passersby couldn't resist at the sight of their crazy shopping. Candy was a good medicine for unhappiness. European people were very fond of it. Suddenly, the shop was crowded with customers.</p><br/><p>\"One kilo of liqueur chocolate, please!\" There was only a hollowed-out piece of paper left in the small basket.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Hard cocoa candy is sold out!\"</p><br/><p>\"Boss...\"</p><br/><p>\"Boss...\"</p><br/><p>A tourist guide was talking about the town, when his group of tourists suddenly poured into the shop. The fat boss was both exasperated and happy. He was stirring syrup in a large bucket with effort. He called his wife and son to come and help him immediately. </p><br/><p>The culprits had left with a big package of candy, the musical sound of the cash register ringing around the shop.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

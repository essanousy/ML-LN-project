Wang Baoqiang arrived a little later. He was so happy that he could barely close his mouth.</p><br/><p> The next morning, all the actors followed Qin Guan and the others who would be acting that day knowingly. Nobody wanted to leave first. They just wanted to watch the legendary man's first scene.</p><br/><p> A superstar like Qin Guan had actually joined an ordinary TV show! This was really strange for them, but they decided to take advantage of this to see what the difference between them was. Thus, everyone followed Director Kang Honglei and waited for the shooting to start.</p><br/><p> \"Where are they? The stylist is too slow.\"</p><br/><p> \"Take it easy. They are coming.\"</p><br/><p> \"I don't mean Wang Baoqiang and Chen Sicheng. I'm talking about the two black guys! Where is Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p> Xu Sanduo, who was a new recruit, trembled in fear as he pushed the door of his dormitory open. His new roommates welcomed him.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was a young squadron leader with high academic education.</p><br/><p> Sunshine filled the dormitory as the tall, handsome man stood up and smiled at the newcomer. His shoulder badges were dazzling.</p><br/><p> He was a general with unparalleled charm that made everyone get lost in his smile.</p><br/><p> Fortunately, Wang, who had been Qin Guan's previous partner, was immune to his smile. However, his poor Mandarin shocked the audience.</p><br/><p> As a straight-A student, Qin Guan didn't need to act. He could just be himself. Acting was that deeply rooted in his blood.</p><br/><p> In the next scene, Qin Guan would have to perform military push-ups as a way of punishment.</p><br/><p> It would be a wonderful show.</p><br/><p> All the male onlookers looked at the drill instructor as they took pleasure in Qin Guan's misfortune. The drill instructor would show Qin Guan the standard push-ups and correct his mistakes.</p><br/><p>\"Keep your body straight and your legs apart! Your shoulder and arm must be on the same level!\"</p><br/><p> His words were as simple and strict as possible.</p><br/><p> \"Like this!\" The soldier stood up and showed Qin Guan. \"Try it!\"</p><br/><p>What? </p><br/><p>All the onlookers were speechless. Duan Yihong was suppressing his laughter so hard that his face looked twisted.</p><br/><p> \"No problem!\"</p><br/><p> When Qin Guan lay down on his stomach and tried it, he shocked everyone.</p><br/><p> It was the exact same thing the instructor had shown. Qin Guan had copied him as flawlessly as a trained soldier.</p><br/><p> \"Has he been in the army?\"</p><br/><p> \"Impossible. He studied abroad!\"</p><br/><p> \"But this is exactly the same thing... Is there some kind of special training for actors?\"</p><br/><p> The director wondered whether Qin Guan was a veteran.</p><br/><p> More than 10 push-ups later, the director finally stopped QIn Guan.</p><br/><p> \"Stop!\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stood up without hesitation.</p><br/><p> \"Well done!\" The director didn't hide his appreciation.</p><br/><p> \"Thank you!\" Qin Guan saluted him like a soldier.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Tang aroused the suspicions of Qin Guan, who intended to find out all about her. As a result, he was very cruel with the beautiful spy.</p><br/><p>Her legs were suddenly exposed and her underwear landed on the floor.</p><br/><p>She was unarmed.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not satisfied though. She was still his enemy. There was no excuse to let her go.</p><br/><p>Tang Wei was pressed against the bed naked. Qin Guan hugged her without hesitation. The two of them had rough, emotionless sex. Tang Wei looked back at Qin Guan with a bitter smile. Her clear, crystal-like eyes revealed the heart of a simple girl.</p><br/><p>There were many women lingering around Mr. Yi, but he rarely came across such a stupid one. Her plain gaze attracted him, so he bent down and kissed her lips roughly.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Tang had gotten this close to her target, under such violent circumstances.</p><br/><p>A man without consciousness was never stopped by desire. He threw a wind coat over Tang's body and left in a hurry. The female assassin hadn't brought any weapons with her. The date had been unexpected, which had actually saved her life.</p><br/><p>Ang Lee didn't stop the cameras until Qin Guan had left. The director asked the actors to live the part, not act it out.</p><br/><p>His intention should not be misunderstood. The violent fighting had been real, but the sex had not. This was a serious movie after all. It was not a porn film. Desire and acting served only as a background for the actors' emotions.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that the film's title was \"Lust, Caution\", the director didn't use lust as a weapon. Instead, he focused on the complicated emotional entanglements between humanity, which was exactly what he wanted to express.</p><br/><p>During the short break, Qin Guan read silently the lines of the next scene. They were a little... too romantic.</p><br/><p>The author of the original work, Zhang Ailing, was a woman who focused on love. Despite the various backgrounds and different characters, her novels were always romantic.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried his best to hold his laughter back during the next scene.</p><br/><p>Tang Wei: I hate you!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan: I know! I know!</p><br/><p>Tang Wei (hysterically): No! You have no idea!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan (sadly): It's not you! You were different three years ago! I only believe our words! It's been a long time since I believed in anyone! You are the only one I trust!</p><br/><p>Tang Wei: You must be lonely then.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan almost collapsed on the floor from laughter. Ang Lee shouted at him angrily, \"What are you doing? You will ruin the scene! Be serious!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was still tittering as he left to take off his clothes. He and Tang would have to be naked in the next scene.</p><br/><p>They both had perfect figures. It was easy for a woman to pretend to climax, but it was just as easy for Qin Guan. He just thought of Cong Nianwei as he performed.</p><br/><p>After the scene, Director Lee called Qin Guan over and patted his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\"We are all men here. I can understand. But as your senior, I would advise you not to watch too much porn. We are all outsiders, but I know how you feel.\"</p><br/><p>As he looked at Tang's disdainful expression, Qin Guan suddenly felt insulted. Before he could explain, Ang Lee sighed and left.</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean, sir? What are you talking about? I have never watched such a movie. I watch serious documentaries at home every day!\"</p><br/><p>Leehom Wang walked over and patted his shoulder, giving him a thumbs-up. Qin Guan fell silent again.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere remained like that until the end of the film, when Tang actually fell in love with Qin Guan. The emotion had nothing to do with her task or the organization. It was a true love between a man and a woman.</p><br/><p>She gave up just before the assassination.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

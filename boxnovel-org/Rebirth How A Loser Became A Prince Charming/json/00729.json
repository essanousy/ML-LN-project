What did this mean?</p><br/><p>It meant that they were burning their bridges. As soon as their conflict with Wang had broken out, they had started drawing influential actors to their side at any cost. The Brothers were afraid of Wang's abilities. She had attracted many actors and won a lot of stars' hearts with her kindness after all.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knocked on the table with his fingers before he asked Sister Xue a seemingly insignificant question.</p><br/><p>\"Has any powerful firm or individual, either foreign or domestic, entered the circle lately?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Why didn't I think of that?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue patted the table. She remembered now! The whole firm was a lot like Qin Guan. It paid no attention to irrelevant people or matters.</p><br/><p>People thought that Qin Guan considered money dirt, but he was actually just waiting to get the highest offer.</p><br/><p>This was not the right time to give lessons to the sixth-generation directors. Sister Xue made several calls. In two minutes, she had collected some valuable information from a reliable source. The reporter she had spoken to, who was Qin Guan's loyal fan, was also the chief editor of the entertainment section of the Wangnan website.</p><br/><p>Some of the news attracted Sister Xue and Qin Guan's attention.</p><br/><p>A mainlander who had been born and raised in Japan had recently moved his Japanese firm to Shanghai. The successful businessman had paid a lot to bring Tetsuya Komuro together.</p><br/><p>The company he had founded in Shanghai was a comprehensive entertainment firm very different from his music firm in Japan. The man was definitely qualified to hire Wang after she left Huayi.</p><br/><p>According to Qin Guan's understanding of Wang, she was not capable enough to establish a company of her own. Even though she knew a lot of actors, she didn't have the money or resources one needed in the circle.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qin Guan exchanged a meaningful glance. They knew that it was this new firm that was trying to challenge the biggest entertainment company in China.</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\" Sister Xue hung up. \"We could wait a few months until they are done fighting. Just to be safe.\"</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her words, Qin Guan shook his head. \"No, I'll get in touch with one of the parties. This is our chance.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up suddenly. \"Huanyi! Sister Xue, contact the Brothers and tell them I'm back! I'm available now. Any job will do.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? You want to join them? The fight has not even begun yet.\"</p><br/><p>\"I've thought it through. I won't intervene in the fight. I just want to use their resources.\"</p><br/><p>\"You mean...\"</p><br/><p>\"Both sides will suffer during the next few days. If Huayi succeeds, my investment on insider equity will be the best support. I will become their partner and enjoy a priority on the best scripts of the company.\"</p><br/><p>\"But what if they fail?\"</p><br/><p>\"That will make things even simpler. A lean camel is still bigger than a horse. I'll have an entertainment firm, a group of famous directors and actors, as well as a good film and TV resource on my hands. Do you think the Brothers would fail at all these things?\"</p><br/><p> Reassured by Qin Guan's confidence, Sister Xue rushed to her desk. \"I'll call them as soon as possible!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Call Chen Kang first. That guy is good at trapping people.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan opened his China Club certification. The club offered only 500 spots for permanent members, but Chen Kang had finished the entire procedure in under half an hour and managed to get Qin Guan some special treatment.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had had to pay only 100 dollars for the membership fee, which was a really low price. Such a talented young man certainly deserved more work.</p><br/><p>Kindness was always paid back. Qin Guan changed clothes at home. That night, he met the Wang Brothers in the same yard where he had met Wang Jianlin.</p><br/><p>Although they had the same surname, they were not related to each other.</p><br/><p>As a new member, Qin Guan had his own yard where he could meet guests. His yard was as big as a country.</p><br/><p>Vines were winding along the fence and wildflowers were blooming silently all around. A few cups of tea would help everyone calm down in the scorching heat.</p><br/><p>The Brothers relaxed and forgot all about the pressure they felt. They wanted to talk about a potential cooperation.</p><br/><p> Back in ancient times, rich men did not forget their poor friends. In modern society though, people were always fighting for profit. The Brothers had worked hard to develop their company. Qin Guan didn't want to fight with them in the future. They were the decision-makers after all. He was only a partner.</p><br/><p> An open, sincere meeting was necessary before their cooperation. That was why he had invited them to the small yard. After enjoying some tea, everyone was in the mood to share their ideas.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

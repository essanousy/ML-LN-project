Yang\u2019s eyes were red and full of tears.</p><br/><p>\"Let me help you...\" Ye Dong murmured.</p><br/><p>Then they felt silent. The train roared as the conductor shouted to the passengers still standing on the platform.</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>When they had begun to talk about their futures, Yang had foreseen this departure.</p><br/><p>After Ye Dong had registered to take the civil servant exams, she had given up all hope. In fact, she had always been struggling to decide between leaving and staying.</p><br/><p>Her decisive boyfriend had informed her about his choice not long after, in the garden they frequently visited.</p><br/><p>\"If you trust me, you will stay with me, Yang Jing. I\u2019m a man, so I can take the responsibility. Maybe at the beginning we won\u2019t live that luxuriously, but that will change.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sorry, Ye Dong. My parents are getting old back home. We are all the backbones of our families. I\u2019m not as resolute as you are. I\u2019ve always loved the countryside. I miss the smell of rice flowers and the song of the harvest flies in this cold metropolis...\"</p><br/><p>\"Maybe I could stay with you for love, but reality will teach us a lesson through this departure. Maybe I\u2019ll marry someone from a small town and watch my parents get old, but my youth, love and first heartbeat will always belong to you, my love.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Jing smiled. Her face looked vague in Ye's eyes. Men only shed tears when they were heartbroken.</p><br/><p>\"Take care of yourself...\"</p><br/><p>Without any words or tears, Yang Jing picked up her luggage. Farewell, my love.</p><br/><p>The strong man started sobbing like a child. The whistle took his love away. Ye Dong covered his eyes, trying to stop the running tears.</p><br/><p>May no other people in love experience that kind of pain.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei returned home together. They would stay with their parents during their last summer in China.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's aged grandparents went to see their talented grandson. They wanted to bid Qin Guan farewell before he left for an unknown country.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's mother was so worried about her son that she began purchasing all kinds of things for Qin Guan, including but not limited to, medicine, tools, cleaning supplies, clothes, cooking utensils and local products.</p><br/><p>She also suggested taking Qin Guan to the capital, so she wouldn\u2019t worry about him.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's father nearly resigned and went to the US with her, but Cong Nianwei\u2019s mother didn\u2019t let him.</p><br/><p>\"Dad, Qin Guan will be with me. What are you so worried about?\"</p><br/><p>That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m worried about. You might return to China in two years with my one-year-old grandson.</p><br/><p>Both families went to Beijing and stayed in Qin Guan's apartment. On the day of their departure, they checked their luggage and passports again and got ready to go.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, put on all your clothes. If your luggage is overweight, you\u2019ll have to pay a fine.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mum, three pairs of pants in August? Are you kidding?\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder if the dormitories in the US have central heating. What if you catch a cold?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan scampered off like a frightened rat. Liu Xiaoyang, who was their driver, gave him a forced smile.</p><br/><p>His large business car was enough for the two families.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you! What a nice guy!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei\u2019s father looked at Liu with a satisfied smile. That young man is pretty nice. He is thin and good-tempered. At least my daughter would beat him in a fight.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei didn\u2019t care about her father\u2019s feelings. If she could read his mind, she would have sneered at him.</p><br/><p>Their families were reluctant to part with them at the security check. An unknown future was waiting for them on the other side of the door. Qin Guan felt sad, despite the fact that he was a tough man.</p><br/><p>To his surprise, Liu Xiaoyang, his best friend from his dormitory, was really calm compared to when he had seen Mu Lejiang off.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was relieved. He had grown up after all. He seemed to have gotten used to departures, which was a must for growing up.</p><br/><p>\"Come on, hug me! I\u2019m leaving. Take care of yourself!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spread his arms out towards him with a warm smile.</p><br/><p>\"You are all gone. You are leaving me alone!\" Liu Xiaoyang turned his face up and burst into laughter. He didn\u2019t care about the onlookers casting astonished glances at him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her eyes were wide open. She announced the good news to the girls in an exaggerated tone, giving them a splendid smile.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, darlings. I have some good news for you. First, I would like to introduce this beautiful lady, who is the chief editor of VOGUE. She came here with some news for our judge Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>The girls held their breaths at the sound of VOGUE. Soon though, they became depressed again.</p><br/><p>\"But...\" Banks opened her wide mouth. \"Everyone on the stage will have the chance to participate in the L\u2019Oreal advertisement! With Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"You won\u2019t just get fashion stills. You\u2019ll be on TV, magazines, posters, printed material\u2026 Anything you can think of!\"</p><br/><p>Before her voice could fade away, the girls hugged each other, laughing and shouting.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan cast a confused look at Qu. I knew nothing about this. Why didn't you inform me in advance?</p><br/><p>Qu looked at him with a poker face while the photographer hastened to turn the camera away.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan opened his eyes wide and sighed through his nose. Fine. You win!</p><br/><p>Once again, Qu had acted first and reported afterwards. Qin Guan decided not to protest. The camera had recorded everything after all. He would have to work with the cameras for both the advertisement and the show anyway.</p><br/><p>The girls ran off the stage like happy birds, heading for L\u2019Oreal in a bus.</p><br/><p>The receptionist was shocked by the scene.</p><br/><p>A handsome Asian man was leading the crowd. He was wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt and a pair of jeans. His perfect figure made those ordinary clothes look really fashionable. Several beautiful girls followed him closely. He was the most attractive one among them.</p><br/><p>A reliable-looking lady stood up and pulled her stunned colleagues to the side. \"Are you Mr. Qin Guan? Follow me, please. The studio is on the third floor.\"</p><br/><p>The young girl came back to her senses, recalling the activity she had been informed about by the assistant of the PR department in the morning. I\u2019m so silly!</p><br/><p>When they got into the elevator, the receptionist took out a small mirror. All those beauties pale in comparison to him, and I\u2019m only a small sparrow compared to them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about her broken heart as he entered the studio with the girls.</p><br/><p>First, he had to put on makeup. The girls would also undergo a total transformation. Qu was taking advantage of L\u2019Oreal.</p><br/><p>The hairdressers, makeup artists and designers got to work. The girls were screaming as they were transformed, Qin Guan was well-prepared though.</p><br/><p>\"Clothes!\"</p><br/><p>The wardrobes in the simple, elegant fitting rooms were opened one by one. The boy in charge of the clothes asked his supervisor, \"Which advertisement is first?\"</p><br/><p>\"Marcin Twardowski!\"</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\" The boy picked out a colorful leisure suit, a pair of shorts and some soft leather shoes. By then, Qin Guan had put on a colorful wig that made him look like rainbow candy.</p><br/><p>When he came out of the fitting room, even Jay was shocked. It was an unwritten dressing rule to never combine more than three colors.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan looked like a crazy paint store. One could find any color on his body. He was wearing a bright pink coat, baby blue shorts, bright yellow shoes... All those bright colors were perfect for baby clothes.</p><br/><p>As the chief editor of a fashion magazine, Qu couldn\u2019t help but ask the creative director of L\u2019Oreal a question.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s a lot of bright colors! Won\u2019t they influence the outcome?\"</p><br/><p>The director pointed to the female models heading for the fitting rooms with a mysterious smile.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019ll see soon enough.\"</p><br/><p>Banks and Jay were nervous to see the result. This was their first episode! As they began to discuss the possibility of causing some disputes among the girls to captivate the audience, the girls went out.</p><br/><p>They were like a rainbow!</p><br/><p>Each girl had been assigned a color that matched Qin Guan's costume.</p><br/><p>Banks was excited about the creative idea, but Qu Xuemei was frowning. L\u2019Oreal's concept went pretty well with the show. They would make the advertisement for free by taking advantage of this. This was a trial for Qin Guan though. The seven colors represented seven different styles. As the main representative, he had to have control over everything. Even the smallest mistake could seem gigantic.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

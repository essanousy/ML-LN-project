She was chopping a green onion into small pieces. \"Of course not. I counted the days and left food for you before you returned. I didn't stay here. I\u2019d just drop in every evening to eat the food. I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste!\"</p><br/><p>My silly girl, I\u2019m not concerned about the food, but about the fact that you cared enough for me to make it.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had originally thought that their position in the relationship was not equal. He had been obsessed with Cong Nianwei for two lives and he just wouldn't let her go.</p><br/><p>He was the weak one who kept chasing her. As a straight-A student at the Architecture Department, Cong Nianwei was always calm and reasonable. Girls like her were serious even when they were in love. Qin Guan was still swayed by the pros and cons of their relationship though.</p><br/><p>It was only on that day that he felt loved during their everyday life.</p><br/><p>His girlfriend didn't ask him to act gracefully. She didn't look down on him because he was poor. She didn't show off to others about his achievements or feel inferior because of his rising social status.</p><br/><p>She was splendid on stage and good at cooking. She had a mighty heart, but she also cared about him. F*ck! I want to cry!</p><br/><p>Just do it! Qin Guan threw the potatoes back into the basin and hugged Cong Nianwei from behind. He lowered his head and buried his face in her hair, murmuring softly, \"Weiwei, I love you.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was so startled, she nearly cut her finger with the kitchen knife.</p><br/><p>As she felt his broad chest and heard his low, charming voice though, she felt slightly intoxicated.</p><br/><p>Opening her lips, she replied, \"I love you too.\"</p><br/><p>Her sweet-smelling hair and honest reply made Qin Guan's blood flow south.</p><br/><p>\"What's this? What\u2019s so hard?\" Cong Nianwei was a little confused. Qin Guan lifted his butt to move that essential part of his away from her. A shorter boy would have failed, but he pulled it off thanks to his height. He still hated to part with his girlfriend though.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei seemed to realize what was going on. Her face suddenly turned as red as an apple. She plunged the knife into the cutting board with a bang and shouted, \"Qin Guan!\" The excited part of him was frightened into shrinking.</p><br/><p>After giving the situation some thought, Qin Guan decided to wash the vegetables instead.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was still speechless by the time she was done cooking. Qin Guan lit several aromatic candles, which were usually used for bubble baths, and turned off the lights. There were various aromas, including lily and rose lavender. It was really romantic, but no one could have had dinner with that thick smell in the air.</p><br/><p>Having such a silly boyfriend was terrible!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned on the lights resentfully and blew out the candles.</p><br/><p>TV had cheated him again! Where was his candlelit dinner?</p><br/><p>Even though they ate the dinner Cong Nianwei had cooked with love, Qin Guan was still aching for something. Leaning against the door frame, he took his most handsome pose and asked her in a low, deep voice, \"Darling, will you stay tonight?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei looked at him as if he was an idiot. She put the clean tableware away and answered, \"None of my stuff is here. I have to return to my dormitory.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan leant against the other side of the frame and said tenderly, \"There\u2019s a supermarket downstairs. We can buy some stuff for you. We have enough time. Besides, I\u2019m worried about you. You live in that dormitory alone. It\u2019s said that there\u2019s a ghost on QH campus. It's too dangerous.\"</p><br/><p>It's more dangerous to stay with a fool like you.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had been living in that dormitory for several days. There were lots of students who spent their holidays at college. There was nothing to be worried about.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had just returned that day though, and she really wanted to stay with him. \"Maybe tomorrow,\" she answered hesitantly. \"I didn\u2019t come prepared today.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan snapped and stepped forward to lift her. He wanted to swirl her around to express his happiness.</p><br/><p>Bang! Qin Guan had forgotten how tall he was. Cong Nianwei's forehead hit the door frame hard.</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at each other silently. Qin Guan put Cong Nianwei down and stood there respectfully, waiting for her reproach.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei burst into laughter. She kicked Qin Guan's leg and said, \"It's late, take me back home!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan relaxed and decided to try to get more out of the situation. He looked at Cong Nianwei with a pitiful, flirting expression. \"I\u2019m afraid of the dark. There aren't many people living on this block. I don't want to be alone. Stay and keep me company. I\u2019ll sleep on the floor. I swear!\"</p><br/><p>Liar! A bold man like you afraid of dark? Qin Guan ignored Cong's disdainful look and brazenly dragged her down to the supermarket.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei followed him, getting everything she needed to spend the night there.</p><br/><p>Satisfied, Qin Guan spread the large Ikea carpet on the living room floor (he\u2019d been driven out of the bedroom). He looked at the sleeping Cong Nianwei in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>The lights were out, and the dim moonlight slid through the curtains and fell on her shoulders. The thin covers set off her soft lines. She looked gentle in the quiet night.</p><br/><p>Standing by the door, Qin Guan stared at her silently for a while. He didn't leave until her breathing slowed down and she fell into a deep sleep.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

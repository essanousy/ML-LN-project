Lions were basically large cats, so it would only take them a couple of leaps to reach him.</p><br/><p>Although Qin Guan had a weapon in his hand, he didn't take any action. A small head emerged between the grown lions. Qin Guan's heart softened under the setting sun.</p><br/><p>He took a look at his watch and the family of three and sighed. He yielded his prey to them.</p><br/><p>Life was hard for both animals and humans. Plus, when the night fell, a new species would wander around the city. A species that used to be human, but was not anymore.</p><br/><p>That was the reason the city was dead. Humans had been infected by a new virus and lost their very nature. They had become strong, cruel, and thirsty for blood. They couldn't live in the sunshine anymore though.</p><br/><p>They were like a mixture of zombies and vampires. The sunshine could kill them, so they could only hunt at night. Deer and lions were delicious meals for the monsters, who lived on fresh, warm blood. Without human wisdom, they had become a completely new species.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the only survivor in the city, so he had to return to his shelter before dark. He roared away without hesitation. When the red car disappeared from the frame, the director stopped the crew.</p><br/><p>\"Perfect!\"</p><br/><p>His assistant handed him a cigarette.</p><br/><p>\"Yes. No NG is needed for such a long shot.\"</p><br/><p>\"We can shoot some more on the last day. It will be a perfect scene.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Asian actor was the right choice. It's crucial that the audience can step in his shoes during the monologue.\"</p><br/><p>\"They are witnessing his lonely life from God's viewpoint. The actor has to express himself through his face and body. Not everyone can do that.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know, that's why I selected Qin Guan for the part. He remains hopeful in hopeless situations.\"</p><br/><p>\"Not everyone loves post-apocalyptic films after all. We have to give people hope.\"</p><br/><p>Lawrence was really satisfied with Qin Guan's performance. </p><br/><p>\"We have two hours left before the next scene. You can walk around, but please don't leave the site.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spent those two hours persuading his fans to leave. They couldn't see well enough at night after all. Qin Guan gave them autographs, so they left satisfied.</p><br/><p>Eventually, he found Xu. Qin Guan grasped his friend's collar and got back all the money he had spent on his stay in the US.</p><br/><p>Then he let him go. It was time to get back to work. He would make more profit out of Xu later.</p><br/><p>It was evening, so the setting sun turned the maple leaves gold. Qin Guan and the cute dog, whose name was Sam, returned to their shelter in New York.</p><br/><p>Hunting hadn't gone well, so Qin Guan had to prepare some food for them.</p><br/><p>Rice and beans were not a good choice of food for a foodie, but Qin Guan didn't complain. The dog was more miserable than him after all. It had to eat rice and chopped vegetables.</p><br/><p>Unsurprisingly, Sam didn't give him any positive feedback. Everyone could see his disgust in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Sam had always been fed normal food, so he had never tasted vegetables with ketchup. Every time the assistant pushed the small basin over, Sam just sniffed it and walked away...</p><br/><p>When the last beam of sunlight vanished, a harsh bell was heard. It was the night warning. Qin Guan pulled down his thick iron door-sheets to block everything out. All the entrances were equipped with thick bolts.</p><br/><p>The human and the dog curled up in a narrow tub. They needed to feel safe in that horrible world. This was the only way they were able to fall asleep.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He always followed his gut.</p><br/><p>\"Brokeback Mountain\" wouldn't be accepted by most Chinese people and some conservative towns and states in America. A script with such a deep analysis of human nature would never be turned down by a director, but Qin Guan turned it down for himself and his Chinese fans.</p><br/><p>Destroying his career over one film would be irresponsible. Li An clinked his glass against Qin Guan's in disappointment and changed the topic.</p><br/><p>They actually had a lot in common. Li An was sad about Qin Guan's decision, but he also knew that customs did not accept certain violations. In the future, he would be more careful when it came to China.</p><br/><p>That matter was only a trifle for the Dubai Film Festival though. The beautiful city had completed its first trial for an international film event.</p><br/><p>Abdul, who was a good, considerate friend, was quite content with Qin Guan's help.</p><br/><p>To show his gratitude, he organized a trip to a famous restaurant in Dubai. The couple visited the Almahara restaurant, which was built on the seabed and had a direct connection to their hotel.</p><br/><p>The restaurant featured golden domes, which helped the structure withstand the huge pressure of the sea water. The building was a product of smart design and a landmark of the city.</p><br/><p>The luxurious restaurant used smooth marble for the interior decorations and was renowned for its crystal cabinets, velvet tapestries and Spanish handmade tableware, which shocked both Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>Its most astonishing feature though was the sea water around the seats. The customers were only separated from the ocean by a thick layer of glass. One could see corals and swaying seaweed just behind the glass and countless beautiful tropical fish shuttling around, looking for food.</p><br/><p>No fish approached Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei's table though. The ocean outside seemed as silent as the Dead Sea. Only tiny plankton and creeping molluscs came close, because Qin Guan didn't affect them as much. The absence of any of their natural enemies allowed them to come out and breathe freely.</p><br/><p>Every time the waiter approached their table, he felt curious about the two mysterious Asians.</p><br/><p>Why did that shark take a sudden pause there? Why did that stingray pull a face at them? Abdul reserved this table because it was the best, but it seems so quiet today.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei buried her face into a menu to hide her laughter.</p><br/><p>Forget it. I'm an easy-going man after all.</p><br/><p>The patrons always tried the seafood, as the cook there was second to none in the city.</p><br/><p>The restaurant's structure was like an oyster shell, so oyster dishes composed a big part of the menu. Oyster meat was served with rose honey there. Even that natural dressing couldn't compete with the wonderful taste of the oyster though. One could swallow it down without even chewing it and it would just slide down their throat to their stomach.</p><br/><p>The other characteristic of the restaurant was its unreasonable luxury. One could have the best food in the world there, as long as they were rich enough. For example, Alaskan king crab, wagyu beef essence and French foie gras were all included in the menu.</p><br/><p>Abdul was paying though, so Qin Guan decided not to go overboard.</p><br/><p>\"A king crab, foie gras dumplings, beef and potatoes, and fresh sea bass. One kilo will do. Oh, and a flaky pastry with brown sugar for takeaway!\"</p><br/><p>The waiter was impressed by the order. The young man seemed to have really good taste. He had to be a tycoon like Mr. Abdul.</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan spent most of his energy on food. A fine restaurant cart was pushed towards their table. That dinner for two was three times more expensive than usual.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's favorite was the dessert. The cream mousse felt like roses seducing her into their soft embrace.</p><br/><p>It felt good to take a walk on the beach after eating a meal. Then the two of them took a nap on the folded beds on the beach, which were there for the hotel residents' convenience. The warm ocean breeze blew a smell of salt over to them, allowing them to experience the typical charm of the Middle East.</p><br/><p>When the time was right, the beach staff served them a glass of juice by the folded chairs. The sound of the waves fascinated everyone.</p><br/><p>The couple was talking leisurely on the quiet beach.</p><br/><p>\"Would you be interested in the city construction program? They will be accepting bids from all over the world.\"</p><br/><p>\"I think any architect would be interested.\"</p><br/><p>\"Meaning?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's a seabed hotel. Like Atlantis.\"</p><br/><p>My wife is so brave. That symbolic hotel will be a large construction.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, my firm is not big enough for such a project. I think the early work would be okay for me though. I'm not qualified for anything bigger. I still need to gain more experience.\" Cong Nianwei sighed. \"You win awards so easily. It's so much harder for me.\"</p><br/><p>She put her hands on Qin Guan's stomach.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch! Stop it! Don't press it!\"</p><br/><p>Their laughter echoed in the beautiful night. That was how Qin Guan's first trip to the Middle East ended. It was only a trial for the new festival, but a large opportunity for the participants.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

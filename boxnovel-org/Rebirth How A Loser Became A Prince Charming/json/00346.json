It would be beneficial for you.\"</p><br/><p> Douglas\u2019 indication was clear to the chief designer. The brand had to find a new direction the following year. His promotion of Qin Guan had attracted attention from the senior executives of the company.</p><br/><p> Meanwhile, Qin Guan's phone was packed with messages. Most of them were from old Columbia professors, assigning more homework to him.</p><br/><p> However, among them was also a strange text from Xu Xiaoxiao: \"Call me back\".</p><br/><p> Qin Guan called him immediately.</p><br/><p> \"Qin Guan, my grandpa\u2019s birthday banquet is tomorrow. Come watch my performance!\"</p><br/><p> \"No problem. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. What should I wear? Should I bring a present?\"</p><br/><p> \"Us young guys will have a cocktail party after the banquet. Formal attire is mandatory. And you are the best present for my grandpa!\"</p><br/><p> What a silly boy! No one can go to a birthday party without a present.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was not worried about that though. He was good at dealing with old people.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei had been invited by Wendy to join an architecture club at Columbia, so she couldn't attend the banquet with him.</p><br/><p> Standing before an ancient style mansion, Qin Guan fixed his black bow tie and called Xu.</p><br/><p> \"Let him in! He is my friend!\" The honest gatekeeper saw Xu shouting from the second-floor balcony and let Qin Guan in without a word.</p><br/><p> A shrine with joss-sticks was placed before the Guan Emperor [1], looking striking in the broad, elegant hall.</p><br/><p> It was surprising to see such a traditional idol in a modern house.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan followed Xu to a small hall on the second floor. There was a stage inside set up for a small-scale martial arts play.</p><br/><p> \"Look at me!\" Xu pulled Qin Guan to the backstage area to show off.</p><br/><p> Can I tell you the truth? You look like Pigsy [2] when you\u2019re playing the Monkey King. </p><br/><p> Qin Guan noticed that Xu Xiaoxiao had a lingering charm thanks to his makeup and costume. He just reminded him, \"Stand still on the stage and watch your posture.\"</p><br/><p> It was better for Xu to stand still while he was singing.</p><br/><p> \"Okay!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took his present out. \"According to your description of him, I think your grandpa will like this.\"</p><br/><p> It was a delicate snuff bottle, half a finger tall. It was made of transparent glaze, and the bottle cap was red coral. Red fancy carps were painted on the bottle.</p><br/><p> It was an elegant bottle with an auspicious implied meaning.</p><br/><p> \"Good snuff is hard to find in China. I took only a little abroad for fear of the custom check.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took out a small antique case. It was snuff from a store at Tianhuizhai, which could be dated back to the Qin Dynasty.</p><br/><p> Cigarettes had replaced snuff for the time being. White people of the last generation preferred to play with the bottles.</p><br/><p> As a banana boy [3], Xu had never seen such a unique thing. He fondled the two items admiringly.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019ll deliver them for you.\"</p><br/><p> By that time, people were already heading upstairs one after the other.</p><br/><p> The guests were all polite. They found their seats by looking at the numbers on their cards. Qin Guan peered out from the gap between the curtains. He felt a solemn vide in the room.</p><br/><p> There were similar Asian faces all around. Everyone was talking to each other happily. Qin Guan got a faint idea of what Xu's family was like.</p><br/><p> A thin old man in a Tang suit sat down at the seat of honor. He seemed hale and hearty. Xu's father announced the beginning of the banquet.</p><br/><p> \"Where is Xiaoxiao?\" Strict Grandpa Xu liked his eldest grandson the most.</p><br/><p> Xu's father knew about his plan. He smiled awkwardly. \"Dad, everyone is here. We should just begin. Xiaoxiao will get here soon.\"</p><br/><p> Grandpa Xu looked around and waved his hands at random. \"Okay.\"</p><br/><p> The opera troupe began its performance. Since this was a birthday banquet, the opera \"Ma Gu Offers Birthday Felicitations\" was a must.</p><br/><p> The curtain rose and a plump lady walked on the stage. She sang along to the rhythm.</p><br/><p> The chatting audience was shocked.</p><br/><p> At the beginning, they didn't recognize Xu Xiaoxiao because of the thick makeup on his face, but his voice betrayed him.</p><br/><p> \"Ha ha ha...\"</p><br/><p> \"Good!\"</p><br/><p> Grandpa Xu spit his water out. Xu's father grinned at him awkwardly. \"Slow down, grampa.\"</p><br/><p>[1] Guan Yu, a character from \u201cRomance Across Three Kingdoms\u201d, the most popular god of Chinese people overseas, especially gangsters.</p><br/><p>[2] The Monkey King\u2019s younger brother in \u201cJourney to the West\", who was originally a pig.</p><br/><p>[3] A nickname for Chinese-Americans (ABC).

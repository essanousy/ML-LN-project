If the director finds out, he'll kill me. God bless! Everything has to go well. Money is on the line!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to his senses when he heard the roar of the GT500. The dog was already sitting on the passenger seat silently. Qin Guan fastened his seat belt and looked at the director.</p><br/><p>\"First scene, hunting deer in the city. Three, two, cameras!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stomped on the accelerator to start the car. The helicopter in the air got to work.</p><br/><p>One of his hands was on the steering wheel, while the other was holding a rifle. The dog was a good partner. It turned around to cast a look at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>It seemed to Qin Guan like it was saying, \"I want to feel the wind, master.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan opened the window. The dog craned its neck outside to enjoy the breeze.</p><br/><p>Actually, it was a beautiful misunderstanding. In the dog's mind, he was the alpha.</p><br/><p>The bravest, fiercest dog in the world glanced at its servant. \"Hey, you. Your boss wants to get some fresh air. This car is too small.\"</p><br/><p>The servant opened the window obediently.</p><br/><p>He seems like a good servant.</p><br/><p>Thus, both the human and the animal were satisfied. The director gestured at his assistant to release the deer. The leader of the pack rushed up to Qin Guan's car.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The deer dispersed in all directions. Unfortunately, a young deer had hit the car.</p><br/><p>\"They are coming!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was really excited to see his prey. He made a sharp turn without hesitation and went after the running deer.</p><br/><p>Up until that moment, silence had prevailed on the set. The only thing people had been able to hear had been the roar of the engine and the sound of the deer's steps.</p><br/><p>Now people saw abandoned buses, broken-down military tanks and collapsed buildings through the camera. Everything was covered by high weeds.</p><br/><p>A terrible disaster must have struck the flourishing city, which looked completely isolated and uninhabited.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was smiling at the camera as he went after his prey. The deer looked really energetic under the sunshine as they ran around the empty city.</p><br/><p>Anyone would feel helpless and desolate in such a setting. This was a lonely life after all. No living things interacted with Qin Guan. He had to be strong to stand the lonely life of that dead city.</p><br/><p>The director, the crew and the fans remained silent. They all felt depressed and desperate. Their emotions were like rocks resting on their hearts.</p><br/><p>Xu was the first to come back to his senses. He broke the silence by whispering to the people around him, \"I have no idea how the movie will turn out, but this scene showed me that it will be a meaningful film. I'm already tired of shallow American blockbusters. This drama has inspired me.\"</p><br/><p>The girls from Columbia shot appreciative looks at him. He had convinced them that he was a sophisticated guy. If a couple of blonde girls asked him out, that would be a good enough compensation for the trip to Lausanne.</p><br/><p>It was funny. The last time Xu had returned to New York, he had been very contented. He had spent a large amount of money though. Wang Liying had calculated and added the cost of Qin Guan's trip.</p><br/><p>The poor guy had been told off by his grandpa for the extra expenses.</p><br/><p>As Xu was busy talking to the girls, the scene went on. When the deer stopped, Qin Guan hit a buck with his rifle. As he went to collect his prey, he saw several giant beasts. Those were lions!</p><br/><p>Of course, the lions were not real. They would be added later with the use of special effects. Qin Guan just acted like he was frightened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

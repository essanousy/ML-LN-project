Everyone burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Alice retreated silently, leaving the school without looking back. Jonathan Bennett was surprised to see his agent lost in thought. She didn\u2019t complain about the director\u2019s favoritism or raise her voice to get the attention of the media.</p><br/><p>She just sat there quietly for a minute and then sighed. \"Let's go to the next audition...\"</p><br/><p> \"What happened, Alice? Who got the part?\" Jonathan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>\"That explains it...\"</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed again as the car roared to life.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan repeated the simple scene. He had no idea why he had gotten the part so easily. He was definitely right for the role, but according to the producer, his biggest advantage was his commercial value.</p><br/><p>He might never have starred in a commercial film before, but he was loved by three celebrities. All their fans would pay to watch a film with him.</p><br/><p> It was difficult for a distracted actor to reach the summit of their career. Only those who concentrated could reach the other shore. That was why the director kept complaining about Lindsay\u2019s absent-mindedness.</p><br/><p>It took them three takes to finish the scene. None of the figurants objected. They had gotten to enjoy Qin Guan\u2019s smile three times! That was definitely worth all that work!</p><br/><p>The only one who was disappointed was Mark. After the scene, he shouted at everyone to get changed.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan massaged his sore cheeks and was about to change clothes, when suddenly Lindsay grabbed his sleeve.</p><br/><p>\"Qin\u2026 Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p> \"Hello. I\u2026 I\u2019m Lindsay\u2026 I like you...\"</p><br/><p>What a direct confession!</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026 I have seen your poster and\u2026 advertisement. I\u2026 I\u2019m also a model...\"</p><br/><p>Lindsay was getting more and more nervous by the minute. Qin Guan nodded. \"I know. POPO chips, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that was me. I\u2026 I like you so much...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan found the stammering girl both funny and annoying. You were a child star. Don't turn into a lovesick fool for me!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't know that actors had their own idols. He changed clothes and sat in a convertible with some other female actors.</p><br/><p>As they drove to the playground. Qin Guan shouted at the heroine, \"Hi!\"</p><br/><p>The sun was shining behind him, the green grass serving as his background. The boy was smiling softly, saying hello with his beautiful voice and trying to get acquainted with a stranger as he went through campus.</p><br/><p>The heroine didn\u2019t take advantage of this chance though. The beautiful girl used to be his girlfriend.</p><br/><p>The girl with the red hair left with her new friend without looking back. She didn\u2019t know how sad the boy felt.</p><br/><p>The fat school janitor watched the filming for a long time. When the heroine left without hesitation, the righteous woman cursed, \"That f*cking b*tch!\"</p><br/><p>The heroine really made her blood boil.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was only one scene like that in the film. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have been called \"Mean Girls\", but \"How the Fans Killed the Heroine\".</p><br/><p>The scene was finished without trouble and Qin Guan returned to the fitting room.</p><br/><p>The production stylist had worked as an assistant for the shows of some famous brands. It was his honor to meet a top model like Qin Guan. It took him a long time to decide about Qin Guan\u2019s outfit. The next scene was the first long interaction between Qin Guan and Katie, so he had to be dressed perfectly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Any ordinary, untrained person would have suffered a concussion in his place.</p><br/><p>From then on, Qin Guan would be more rational when it came to action scenes. This was different than martial arts. This was fatal action!</p><br/><p>Just as everyone thought they could call it a night, Director Lawrence shouted at them, \"Once again! The car is not in the right place. I saw the stuntman's face though the camera. Once again! Lower your body. Don't show your face!\"</p><br/><p>The man nodded calmly. Suddenly, Qin Guan realized how ridiculous his job was compared to the stuntman's.</p><br/><p>One had to give credit to any actor that was willing to risk their life for a film. Those brave men had silently contributed to every outstanding action movie in existence.</p><br/><p>When the tired crew members finished their job for the night, they saw some food trucks approaching with their lights on.</p><br/><p>The delicious food was steaming hot.</p><br/><p>\"My treat!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan paid any food truck he could find around the square. The thrifty guy had finally learned how to be generous.</p><br/><p>The square became an ocean of joy. Everyone enjoyed the free dinner happily, including Sam, who came back to life after eating some beef and pork. </p><br/><p>After the celebration, they all had a good night's sleep.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was busy working, Sister Xue received an invitation from the Madame Tussauds Wax Work Museum. They were asking Qin Guan if he wanted to have his own wax sculpture there. Madame Tussauds had just opened its sixth branch in Shanghai and wanted to create the sculptures of a group of Chinese stars.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would have to fly to the headquarters of the Madame Tussauds Museum in the UK. The shooting had nearly come to an end, so Qin Guan was soon able to travel to Baker Street and meet the artist.</p><br/><p>After their meeting, Qin Guan was told that his sculpture had been approved to be in the main Madame Tussauds Museum. This meant that his wax work would travel around the world if necessary, along with other classic works, such as the death mask that had been produced during the French Revolution and the guillotine that had cut off the head of Queen Mary of Scots.</p><br/><p>It was a rare opportunity, so Sister Xue made the decision for him.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was arguing with the director about a temporary change that had messed up his plan. It was not professional to change a script halfway through production, so the good-tempered Asian revealed another side of his personality. </p><br/><p>To avoid any conflict, Director Lawrence decided to explain everything to him.</p><br/><p>\"I can't accept the ending of the original script. Those creatures are not living dead in my eyes. They are a new species. It's selfish for a human to decide their fate based only on the knowledge he currently has.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's why I want to change the ending. You will leave the vaccine to a female survivor and her child and perish along with the monster. This will leave hope for the future.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by his view. Lawrence considered those horrible creatures equal to humans. According to him, the new species didn't need to be saved by the vaccine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Thank you, Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan changed into his own clothes and opened the door.</p><br/><p>\"You are talking like a sentimental girl, Ye Dong! Have you finally surrendered to my charm? Ouch! What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>Ye hugged him around the shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"What am I doing? I want to take a picture with you! I should take advantage of this before you take off your robe!\"</p><br/><p>\"Three, two, one\u2026 Cheese!\"</p><br/><p>They stood side by side, looking happily at the camera. The man with the square face was making the victory sign.</p><br/><p>They were both smiling heartily, happy about their reunion and their bright future.</p><br/><p>They would make great progress after the Fashion Week.</p><br/><p>As expected, when the news about the outstanding show spread online and through traditional media, Yin Changtao became the new favorite of the fashion magazines.</p><br/><p>Milan Fashion: Yin Changtao is a pioneering newcomer with a high-end design concept. His brand has been welcomed with open arms by the market!</p><br/><p>The London Times: It was a perfect show of traditional Chinese art. The oriental Heaven we have been dreaming of since the Middle Ages is finally here. Now we know why silk was considered a luxury product by nobles during past centuries.</p><br/><p>French Media: This is the origin of beauty. I think every reporter that attended the show will always remember that fairy. He might be Asian, but he belongs to the whole world. One year ago, Giorgio Armani ignored all objections and pushed this young man to the front stage. I think many people had been waiting for him to fail, myself included. Some people even speculated that he was the illegitimate child of the old man.</p><br/><p>The Asian boy refused to give any interviews. Instead, he kept studying at college. I think we knew even less about him than we did about Cindy Crawford's dog.</p><br/><p>The quiet model shocked the world at the Fashion Week though. Oh, no. He did not shock us. He just did his job. Words couldn't express my feelings about Chinese style. I can only surrender to Qin Guan's unprecedented elegance and talent.</p><br/><p>Reporters and fashion critics glorified the show, the designer and Qin Guan with their kind words. Du Juan and Lv Yan were outshadowed by Qin Guan's popularity, but they knew his story very well. They were also fans of his.</p><br/><p>As professional models, they thought of Qin Guan as their idol and the No.1 model in the Chinese fashion circle. American people were more subtle though.</p><br/><p>They used to sneer at the European economic depression and weakness, but they actually admired European art and culture. The reports in the American media the next day were shameless.</p><br/><p>The New York Times: America is witnessing the rise of Qin Guan. Nobody can deny that Qin Guan is a Chinese student. Nobody could deny that America is his favorite country. The top five American fashion magazines have contributed to his success, and so have American high-end products. The Chinese young man is also studying at Columbia and has collaborated with Miramax and Paramount Pictures.</p><br/><p>Thus, we could say that New York created Qin Guan, and Qin Guan has contributed to New York's popularity.</p><br/><p>It was a shameless, but undeniable point of view.</p><br/><p>In one day, Columbia had received more than 10 donations, the fans on Qin Guan's official blog had reached 180,000, and all the products he had advertised were selling like crazy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Britney Spears and Madonna's record company was the happiest though. Their single had reached the third place on the charts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

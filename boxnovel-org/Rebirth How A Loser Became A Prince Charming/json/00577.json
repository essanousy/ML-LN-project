She hadn't told Qin Guan, but she had an American Express Platinum, so when her total credit reached the necessary standard, the airline company would present her with two free first-class tickets.</p><br/><p>One could use those tickets any time they wished.</p><br/><p>The ignorant guy felt moved as he got ready to enjoy the high-end flight service. He had always abided by diligent, thrifty principles, which was why Barris had said that the Chinese were just like the Jewish.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Qin Guan, who was a frequent business class passenger, was travelling first-class.</p><br/><p>There was a large seat occupying the space of a single bed and a folded desk right next to it. They were both simple, yet luxurious.</p><br/><p>The cabinet could only hold eight passengers, but there were two air hostesses leading the way for him. Despite being an experienced and sophisticated guy, Qin Guan was shocked.</p><br/><p>When he took his seat, the air hostess opened a small cabinet in front of him considerately, indicating that he could store his backpack inside. When everything was ready, she took a bow and left.</p><br/><p>In one minute, she returned with a wet towel and a glass of champagne. She opened a package carefully and put a pair of disposable slippers before Qin Guan's feet.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt awkward. I feel like a master ordering about a maid.</p><br/><p>The girl was wearing a short skirt and her hair was tied back in a tight bun. She looked really happy. Her name was Matta and she was a famous United Airlines beauty. She had seen Qin Guan at the check-in counter earlier and had taken advantage of her post to serve him herself.</p><br/><p>\"Dear passenger, it will take us eight hours to reach New York. Would you like to change into your slippers?\"</p><br/><p>Hey! If there had been another passenger sitting nearby, they would have complained. Since when did United Airlines offer such luxurious services?</p><br/><p>It was a pity that there was no one else in the cabinet. Matta looked up gracefully.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, the plane shook slightly and Matta fell towards Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p> Bang!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Qin Guan was capable of dealing with such girls. Before Matta could fall into his arms, he reacted smartly.</p><br/><p>He stretched one of his legs towards her for support, so that she wouldn't smash her face against the floor.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, while he did so, a second passenger was being led in by another stewardess.</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\" </p><br/><p>\"Hush...\"</p><br/><p>They saw Matta throw herself at Qin Guan and bury her face between his legs without hesitation.</p><br/><p>It was just a misunderstanding caused by a different point of view.</p><br/><p>The other stewardess covered her mouth with her hands. She was actually eager to spread the gossip. Meanwhile, the passenger whistled happily in an effort to stir up trouble.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a disdainful look at Matta, who was holding his knee tightly, and looked back at the whistle.</p><br/><p>When the passenger saw Qin Guan clearly, his smile got even bigger. He gave Qin Guan a thumbs-up before he burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed helplessly. \"Long time no see, Chris Angel!\"</p><br/><p>The man was an American magician who had just finished a show in Europe and was on his way back to New York.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! Qin Guan! Serves you right! Aren't you a knight in an ivory tower! I thought you were as pure as an angel! What are you doing right there? You are like a candle in the dark. Silly women rush up to you like moths.\"</p><br/><p>He sat down in the seat across Qin Guan, rolling around and covering his stomach. Matta took advantage of this to get up.</p><br/><p>\"What can I do for you?\" She tried to cover up her embarrassment by offering her services.</p><br/><p>Chris stopped laughing and sized her up from head to toe. Then he asked both the air hostesses to leave.</p><br/><p>Lilian was so angry that she nearly exploded. You took advantage of your post to serve Qin Guan and now you seized this passenger from me too! What are you after?</p><br/><p> They had both been flying for a whole year, and their unstable schedule made it difficult for them to find a boyfriend. Their only choices were male colleagues and single passengers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

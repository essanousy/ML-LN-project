When they were free, Li Jian touched the fat on his stomach, turned suddenly toward Qin Guan and asked, \u201cJust now I was thinking about something. The three of us, \u201d he pointed at Zhou Jian and Qin Guan, \u201ccan be considered top students, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing nodded in agreement. Li Jian went on, \u201cThen why are we doing jobs that are for junior high students?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at Li Jian speechlessly, \u201cAs a poor man with only 200 yuan to invest and an undergraduate without a diploma, what job can you do except sell something on the market? Do you hope that some big boss suffering from a mental disorder will come begging you to save his business with tears in his eyes? Or are you perhaps waiting for an investment predator to present you with a share of stocks as a gift for your outstanding scores?\u201d</p><br/><p>The flesh on Li Jian\u2019s cheek was shaking while the old woman selling underwear pulled Qin Guan with effort and said, \u201cHey, stop talking. There comes the urban management officer. \u201d</p><br/><p>With a particularly scared expression on their faces, the three of them looked at the other end of the long street. A young man, not much older than them, was checking the stands idly. He was wearing an urban management officer uniform, which looked appalling.</p><br/><p>They stopped chatting and swept up the unsold scrolls and pictures, piling them in the tricycle as they prepared to run away.</p><br/><p>However, the noise had attracted the officer\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Zhao Fengzhu was feeling quite gloomy that day. He was a formidable graduate with a criminal investigation specialty in the Detective Training School who hadn\u2019t been assigned to the police force. Instead, he had unfairly been stuck into the urban management squad, because his father had been too worried about his safety.</p><br/><p>As an aspiring young man, he was too impatient to socialize with the old women who run the stands there.</p><br/><p>Zhao Fengzhu was feeling quite depressed when he discovered the three thieves. \u201cStop! You dare run an illegal stand in a formal market? You were acting in utter disregard of the law!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Zhao Fengzhu\u2019s first day at work, so he decided to catch the three scoundrels himself.</p><br/><p>They saw the officer rolling his sleeves up and rushing over. Qin Guan shouted loudly, \u201cRun! Quick! Run!\u201d</p><br/><p>They ran quickly towards the exit of the market. Qin Guan was riding on the tricycle, pedaling non-stop like a deer.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing ran and hid among the stands like a clever monkey up a tree.</p><br/><p>Li Jian felt like he\u2019d never run this fast before. Wind blew under his feet while the thrilling northern wind roared in his ears.</p><br/><p>The flesh on his face had flattened to both sides and shook slightly while he ran.</p><br/><p>He was satisfied with his burst of energy, and felt like time had stood still as he sprinted. Oh, fine. He had been caught.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had already gotten far away when he heard Li Jian cry from somewhere behind him, \u201cHelp! Qin Guan! Zhou Jin! Help me! I\u2019ve been caught!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stopped pedaling, let out a sigh and turned around.</p><br/><p>He found the proud young officer twisting Li Jian and Zhou Jing jumping up and down beside them without knowing how to help.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could do nothing but take advantage of the push power momentum of the tricycle to leap high from his seat. He kicked the young officer down to the ground, pulled Li Jian onto the seat of the tricycle and shouted loudly, \u201cPedal like your life depends on it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any word, Li Jian burst into infinite power in an instant. His short legs pedaled up and down as they rode far away.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made a gesture to Zhou Jian, \u201cYou go first. I\u2019ll meet you at your place.\u201d With an anxious glance at Qin Guan, Zhou Jing followed Li Jian swiftly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Fengzhu whisked the dirt off his clothes and said, \u201cWell done. You must be really loyal to your friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was straightforward, \u201cCut the crap. Let\u2019s have a one-on-one contest. If you catch me, I\u2019ll follow you wherever you want. I\u2019ll be at your disposition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Qin Guan\u2019s words, Zhao Fengzhu felt admiration for him. Besides, he had graduated from a detective training school. His fighting skills were surely better than Qin Guan\u2019s, who looked like a college student.</p><br/><p>Thus, Zhao Fengzhu told Qin Gun generously, \u201cFine, one-on-one, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pointing at the square off Binjiang Road, Qin Guan said, \u201cThere\u2019s an open space over there. Let\u2019s not fight here, or we\u2019ll destroy the stands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Fengzhu fixed his hat. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said and walked directly to the square.</p><br/><p>When he turned his head away, Qin Guan grinned. He sneaked around to a small nearby alley and ran away.</p><br/><p>Zhao Fengzhu was still thinking about which tricks he could use to beat Qin Guan when he stood on the square and turned around. He found nothing behind him except garbage flying around in the chilly winter wind.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s when he realized he had been tricked by Qin Guan. Grinding his teeth, he thought, \u201cYou wait and see, boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them escaped successfully and met up at Zhou Jin\u2019s house. They calculated their income that day and went to buy supplies again.</p><br/><p>Why they didn\u2019t give up when they\u2019d just been chased by an urban management officer? They had made money! They had sold hundreds of pictures and scrolls in only one morning! The cost-income ratio had been so high, it had exceeded their expectations.</p><br/><p>They muttered and reached the conclusion that, according to the checking rules, the officers were not expected to go around the morning market very early in the morning. They decided to rush into danger and ran a stand again the next morning.</p><br/><p>The following two days went basically like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, sir! Look at this Spring Festival picture! Look at the bright colors!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many pieces do you want, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Until a cry came from Zhou Jing, \u201cAh! Here comes the young officer again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the three of them ran away wildly.</p><br/><p>This time, Li Jian pedaled on the tricycle while the other two ran on foot. Zhou Jian tripped over a bamboo pole and let out a dramatic cry, \u201cHelp me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jian pedaled ahead hard. He wouldn\u2019t be brought down by the others. Qin Guan took hold of the other end of the pole, and eyed Zhou Jing, asking him to run at the chance. Zhou Jing rolled to climb up. He turned his head to run away.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan held the end of the pole tightly, swept away in some direction. Zhao Fengzhu was pulled over by inertia.</p><br/><p>The middle of the pole hit a lamp pole with a loud sound. Qin Guan let go of the pole in time and turned to run. Zhao Fengzhu was taken by surprise. The bamboo pole shook desperately because of Qin Guan. Zhao Fenzhu couldn\u2019t seem to get loose. He just shook together with the pole like going through an electricity shock.</p><br/><p>The pole gradually stopped moving, just when Zhao Fengzhu thought his bones were about to break into pieces.</p><br/><p>The young officer was extremely irritated. \u201cYou wait for me. I\u2019ll fight to my last breath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and others met up and calculated their income once more. It was good. The young officer hadn\u2019t arrived too early. They could still make some money. They looked at each other and asked, \u201cOne more day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne more day!\u201d It was settled.</p><br/><p>The same scene took place the next morning. They escaped successfully once again. Zhao Fengzhu\u2019s wide-edge cap hung on his crotch, swaying in wind as he sniffled and climbed off the tree he had ended up on.</p><br/><p>Looking at the dusty cap, Zhao Fengzhu whisked the dust off and murmured to himself, \u201cThis is bullying! I\u2019m not coming here tomorrow, okay? I\u2019ll go to the Sanzhan Morning Market.\u201d He returned to his squad like nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the three boys were discussing together. \u201cOur business is not bad these days, but the sales in the morning market will reach their limit soon. All potential customers will have made a purchase. We\u2019ll have to change our venue. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing and Li Jian replied, \u201cWhat about the Sanzhan Morning Market? It\u2019s far away from here.\u201d The decision was made.</p><br/><p>The next morning, the three of them run into Zhao Fengzhu again in the Sanzhan Morning Market. The two parties looked each other speechlessly. The young officer stared at them bitterly and turned his face away, pretending he hadn\u2019t seen them.</p><br/><p>They breathed a big sigh of relief. The alarm was over. They cleared their stock smoothly. After counting all the change and deducting the invested capital, they found that they had earned 530 yuan each.</p><br/><p>They patted Qin Guan on the shoulder encouragingly, \u201cSee you on the next vacation, comrade.\u201d They left fully satisfied as they counted the bills in their hands.</p><br/><p>Looking at the change piled on the table, Qin Guan sighed slightly. The two of them were sure depending on him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned home in the evening. He gave his mother 600 yuan, including the amount he had earned during the vacation. At the touched expression in her eyes, Qin Guan said shyly, \u201cMom, I know it hasn\u2019t been easy raising me. This is for your hard work. You can spend it on anything you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s mother didn\u2019t look so touched anymore. Grabbing him by the ear, she shouted, \u201cI raised you to such a tall young man! Is that all it\u2019s worth? You little bastard!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

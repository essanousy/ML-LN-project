He had to choose the right company first. Large-scale private enterprises and foreign companies were out of the question, as they wouldn\u2019t choose a college student as a part-time accountant, even if he didn't ask for payment. They were too afraid to open their doors to stranger.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Qin Guan excluded those companies and picked a machinery agency as his first choice.</p><br/><p>This had been his profession in his past life, so he knew it well and could manage it easily. He had just switched from a technical advisor post to an accountant post, which would grant him more advantages.</p><br/><p>He made an excited speech to the girl at the reception, making sure to mention machinery development history, the concepts of upper agencies, the perspectives of bidding, and the national focus in the future.</p><br/><p>The girl was really attracted to his looks and talent. She called her boss excitedly and described Qin Guan as a genius on Earth.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhenqian was sleeping in his office, his face buried in a book. The call had woken him up. He was curious about the talented young man introduced by his assistant. Where is this god from? Why would he drop in my small temple? My assistant will think I\u2019m a blind villain if I don\u2019t hire him. I\u2019m free, so I might as well see him!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had succeeded in passing though the third passpoint.</p><br/><p>The girls of the company hurried to serve him. They carried chairs in and took water to the office. Finally, the strongest girl led Qin Guan into the boss\u2019 office.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was chilled by her sweet voice as she said, \"Follow me.\" The two of them entered the office.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, she didn't forget to cast a soft glance at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He tried to calm down before he knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\"Come in, please.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed in when he heard the voice.</p><br/><p>\"It's you? Zhang Zhenqian?\" Qin Guan was really surprised.</p><br/><p>\"You know me? Impossible!\" Zhang Zhenqian had no recollection of Qin Guan. If he\u2019d met such a handsome guy, he would have remembered him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked to see him. Time stood still in that moment. Zhang was younger than the man he had met in his past life by ten years. He hadn't gone through the hardships of life yet.</p><br/><p>In Qin Guan's past life, they had felt like old friends when they\u2019d first met during a business bidding conference. From then on, they had worked in collusion with each other to cheat Qin Guan's company. Whenever Qin Guan had gotten a secret order, he had taken products from Zhang and taken advantage of his position to share small parts of a big program with him.</p><br/><p>Thanks to their mutual exchange, they had led a happy life. Once, after getting drunk, Zhang had told Qin Guan about his arduous history of entrepreneurship.</p><br/><p>It was wonderful to see his old friend look so good.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to his senses and realized Zhang was still waiting for an answer. He smiled happily. \"Do you know Bu Qinglu?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang nodded. \"Yes, do you know him? Did he recommend me? Impossible! I\u2019m here only for a few days. I didn\u2019t tell anyone.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, he told me about you in a conversation. He said you were famous in the Chaoyang District. He described your golden chains, tiger tattoo, bare head, and the scar on the corner of your eye. You are exactly as Brother Bu told me. That\u2019s why your name escaped my lips.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang looked down at the golden chains hanging over the tiger tattoo on his chest. He touched his bare head and smiled proudly. \"Ha, I\u2019m famous. Bu is really loyal to me.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan covered up his mistake, smiling to himself. Zhang is the same careless man. He still believes everyone.</p><br/><p>\"Tell me, what can I do for you? Bu's friends are my friends too.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m looking for a job.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made a detailed introduction of his status. The bald man turned out to be quite shrewd in business.</p><br/><p>\"If you need my help, no problem. I\u2019ll do my best to help you. If you want to work in my company though, it might be awkward. To tell you the truth, one accountant is enough for a small company. I only founded my company three months ago, and I have no business yet. Do you want to learn here? Personally, I think you should ask Bu first. He must be crazy, as he started a business with Wang Hailiang. According to my understanding, the two of them won\u2019t employ an accountant. You could ask them yourself though. If they refuse, you can always return here. You\u2019re welcome to come chat with me again.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw hope in his future. He shook hands with Zhang and said goodbye. \"I\u2019ll go find Bu. Would you like to have a drink someday?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why not? Leave me your number.\" Zhang was fond of straightforward guys. Just like that, they became friends again.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left the Motorola Building and headed for the Lama Temple without stopping. He found Bu and Wang in a shop by the street, smoking and playing cards.</p><br/><p>The three of them looked at each other for a minute. Then Wang ran up to Qin Guan with open arms.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t seen each other since the battle on Gui Street, but they had kept in touch through the phone. Qin Guan had been too busy with work and had always refused their gratitude.</p><br/><p>Wang was excited to see him again though. Words cannot express my gratitude. You saved my life, brother.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan made his purpose for meeting them clear, Wang agreed without any hesitation. Patting his chest, Bu nodded repeatedly. He suggested taking Qin Guan to the office so he could get familiar with it. He also wanted to introduce him to the rest of the staff.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan followed them to a one-storey building in Hutong with a serious expression. He saw a big handmade sign on the roof, supported by a tripod.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

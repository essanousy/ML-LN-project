It's beautiful. Is it on sale?\"</p><br/><p> He used that excuse to talk more with the woman.</p><br/><p> \"No, no matter the price.\"</p><br/><p> The woman stood up with the bottle. She was about to get off the train. Qin Guan stood opposite her. He was actually talking to the air.</p><br/><p> \"I really love it. Could you please...\"</p><br/><p> He was shameless. Director Zhang Zhou couldn\u2019t express his feelings. The young man looked like a completely different person.</p><br/><p> By that time, the heroine would throw the elegant bottle directly onto the floor to get rid of him. The bottle would break into pieces and shock the honest man. Her furious, rebellious ways attracted him to her.</p><br/><p> Zhang Qiang was an ordinary, realistic name, and so was the man himself. Luckily, he could understand why the girl was crazy, as well as that she would never fall in love with him.</p><br/><p> With enough patience and perseverance though, he would pull her back to reality and help her take control of her own life.</p><br/><p> It was a pity that his efforts wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand Zhou Yu's ardently love for Chen Qing. \"The heart is the final container of love,\" Zhang Qiang told Zhou Yu.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan finished the first scene without any trouble or excitement. Director Zhang Zhou was both surprised and annoyed. Young man, your face is your shortcoming. If you were a little uglier, I could convince the producer. You cannot even convince me though!</p><br/><p> By then, Liang Jiahui was older than 40, Gong Li was about 30 and Qin Guan was 20. A crazy romance like that couldn\u2019t happen to the three of them. If this was another story, Zhang might have made a small change to the script. That script was adapted from a novel with a fixed plot though.</p><br/><p> Sun Honglei doesn\u2019t have much experience on screen, but he has an honest face. He will be right for the role.</p><br/><p> Director Zhang stood up and patted Qin Guan on the shoulder. \"I\u2019m sorry, Qin Guan, but the role is not for you. You have a big problem, which might change after a film. You are not capable of hiding your feelings, you\u2019re only good at showing them. If you combine that with your appearance...\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan felt sad, but enlightened. Hiding and showing feelings? I\u2019ll keep that in mind. I remember Sun Honglei. That lucky dog!</p><br/><p> Speak of the devil, and he\u2019s sure to appear. Sun, who had just finished the film \"Conquering\", brushed past them in the corridor. He had short hair and an honest smile.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan looked at him with envy. He couldn't do anything but comfort himself.</p><br/><p> His failure to get the role drove the artistic film down an original path. Sun would fall in love with Gong Li and crash his head.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei, I need to be comforted!</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei was surprised to see that her boyfriend had lost his usual humor. He was lying down on his desk like a withered flower. Influenced by him, she stopped working. I\u2019m almost done anyway. I can call it a day and relax.</p><br/><p> She lay down on the desk face to face with Qin Guan. \"Are you feeling unhappy? Shall we go out on a date?\" she asked and kissed his face.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Qin Guan felt refreshed. He was full of energy again.</p><br/><p> I love you, Cong Nianwei. Go to hell, Zhou Yu!</p><br/><p> Qin Guan pushed all his negative thoughts away. He stood up with sparkling eyes and said, \"Date! Date!\"</p><br/><p> They disappeared amid a storm of chairs and desks.</p><br/><p> \"Where are we going? Movie? Dinner?\"</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei smiled mysteriously. \"Chao Yang Park.\"</p><br/><p> In a daze, Qin Guan turned right on the fourth ring.</p><br/><p> As an entertainment park, Chao Yang Park was famous for all kinds of festivals and carnivals, such as tourist exhibitions, lantern festivals and beach sports. There were no activities during that period though.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei bought two tickets for sports and pulled Qin Guan into the park.</p><br/><p> I\u2019ll freeze in the winter. Qin Guan had underestimated Cong Nianwei. When they reached their destination, he had the impulse to kneel down. </p><br/><p> Bungee jumping? It\u2019s more than 70 metres high! Are you kidding?</p><br/><p> Qin Guan tried to escape, but failed. Trying to save his dignity, he mounted the tower, despite the fact that he was trembling.</p><br/><p> The elevator went up higher and higher. Swallowing saliva, Qin Guan sat in the middle of the elevator, hugging his knees. His girlfriend was really brave. The height caused him terror that was impossible for him to conquer.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei put on her helmet and smiled brightly at him. The occasional brave act made one appreciate their peaceful life even more.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Did he want to express his admiration for the chef's cooking skills? Maybe... French cuisine was the best work of any Michelin cook and the favorite of food critics after all.</p><br/><p>Maybe he had been shocked by the artistic design of the dishes and did not have the heart to even touch the painting-like gourmet plates. They were too beautiful to eat!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Qin Guan did not say what they expected.</p><br/><p>\"Fifteen grams of konjac flour and three grams of P\u00e9rigord truffle. These materials cost a lot, but the truffle is pickled. It can't cost much more than three dollars. The tomato smoothie weighs 20 grams, so it must cost 0.58 dollars.\"</p><br/><p>\"The other three dishes must cost 9.33 dollars in total. I spent 110 dollars on this meal, plus the 1.88% tax collected by the City Hall... What do you think of your prices?\"</p><br/><p>Stupefied, the waitress lowered her head until it reached her breasts. Suddenly, the other patrons decided that the food was not that tasty.</p><br/><p>They looked at their dishes pitifully. Even the chef's top cooking skills couldn't arouse their appetite. Although French cuisine focused on high-end taste and style, its cost was just too high.</p><br/><p>\"Don't tell me that the ducks were fed dew and organic corn. All the ingredients were ordinary. My tongue can tell the difference.\"</p><br/><p>The boss walked over personally, wiping beads of sweat away. The situation was about to get out of control. If the guy protested openly, all the patrons would refuse to pay their checks.</p><br/><p>The man apologized carefully in an effort to prevent an uprising.</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry, each meal includes five dishes, but we'll serve you four more as a bonus. There are actually nine dishes in total.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded generously at his explanation. \"The loss in quantity could be compensated that way. Well done! It's a good idea to maintain a variety of dishes.\"</p><br/><p>He gave the boss a thumbs-up with a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>The cook cried out in the kitchen. How can I make four more dishes from scratch?</p><br/><p>He had no choice though. All the other patrons applauded. Some people who had already finished their dinner stayed for the bonus dishes.</p><br/><p>The waiters hurried to serve all the patrons cakes, liqueur chocolate, fresh fruit with light cream, and Tangyuan served with rose petals and caviar...</p><br/><p>The cook also had to make bacon and fried eggs. It was not an easy life for anyone.</p><br/><p>People all over the world loved bonuses and gifts. The patrons raised their cups and made toasts to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei left the fine restaurant satiated. From that day on, the menu was changed. The five authentic French dishes still remained on the menu, but when the patrons started eating their dinner, other dishes would be served for free one after the other.</p><br/><p>That considerate gesture satisfied everyone. As a result, the restaurant was booked up for the following year. Taking advantage of this, the boss opened another restaurant in New York, thus starting a competitive business franchise.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were sitting in a long luxurious car that looked more expensive than the one the godfather from Sicily had owned. There was a blank expression on their faces as Chris sat across from them, waving his arms and stamping his feet in joy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had been tricked into cooperating with Chris back on the airplane. Then Sister Xue had given in to the high payment and said yes to the trip to Las Vegas. She still drew some lines when it came to magician shows though.</p><br/><p>She would turn down all the bloody ones, but accept the safest ones, such as \"Floating\", which was suitable for a large stage. Thus, Qin Guan had agreed to the plan.</p><br/><p>Another important reason for agreeing was Cong Nianwei, who had decided to participate in a construction competition with a big award along with Rongzhi.</p><br/><p>The award was called \"Open Design\", a prize related to internet business. The competition was being organized by some young internet tycoons who wanted to promote the internet and show their overall plan to the whole community.</p><br/><p>In order to avoid affecting the everyday lives of the residents, the IT geeks had thought of a plan. They were hoping that both the authorities and the general population would approve the development of a cable and optical network.</p><br/><p>As uprising stars, they were much more active than old-fashioned financiers.</p><br/><p>Their program attracted new designers of avant-garde style. The tycoons marked out an area in a small town and paid for the reconstruction rights.</p><br/><p>Dear everyone, here is the new book of Kiki, my lovely editors.

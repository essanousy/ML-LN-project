Ouyang knew he was innocent. It's not my fault. Ouyang turned to Qin Guan with a hostile expression. Qin Guan shrugged. It's not my fault either.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan handed the featured outfit to Shao Xiaobing. Shao's assistant stepped forward and took the clothes before following Shao into the fitting room. (Having an assistant was the difference between a C+ level and an A- level model.)</p><br/><p>When Shao changed into the outfit and went out, everyone turned their eyes to him except the designer. The legs were a little longer, but that was not a big problem. The shoulders were loose though, as Qin Guan's body was a little stranger than Shao\u2019s slender figure. What could they do about that?</p><br/><p>Traditional western-style clothes had thick sponge pads on the shoulders, which had been the leading fashion trend at the time. The most serious problem of the suit was that the mats were drooping on Shao\u2019s body. Qin Guan's shoulders were broad and thick, while Shao\u2019s were quite narrow. The towering mats were hanging from his shoulders as if they were unnecessary. He looked like he\u2019d been hit. His drooping shoulders and shrank neck made him look like a doormat.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen tried to suppress his laughter. He was putting so much effort into it that his nostrils had gone wide. Qin Guan didn't find Shao interesting, but he thought Ouyang Fen looked funny. \"Hey, be careful! I can see the hair in your nostrils!\"</p><br/><p>He is definitely my arch enemy. And to think I was just thinking of comforting the guy! I should never show mercy to someone like him!</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing stood still backstage. Fang Yangyu was too busy working to adjust his outfit. The shirt show had already begun, so he only had about half an hour to finish the details.</p><br/><p>Among the busy crowd, Shao Xiaobing\u2019s assistant noticed that Shao's fists were clenched in his sleeves and his lips were closed into a tight smile. The assistant retreated in fear, a chill going down his body.</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu exhaled in relief after the final stitch. Everything else was up to Shao. His boss was confident about him, so he should also rely on him. The T shirt show had ended by then, but the host left time for the dealers to think about their orders.</p><br/><p>All the information about the outfits was in their hands. They could make their decisions according to the statistics and the samples in the show. The order quantity would be decided by various elements, such as the local popularity of the style. At the end of their files, there were considerate options of the estimated amounts.</p><br/><p>By then, the dealers who were familiar with each other had already started talking. Once they made a decision, they could just tick one of the options.</p><br/><p>\"SS Group has changed a lot this year.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"I don't know whether those changes are beneficial to me. My distributors prefer traditional clothes.\"</p><br/><p>\"So do mine, but times are changing. Innovation prevails. Without creativity, SS Group will lose its current position.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry about the future, just consider the status quo. We are all long-term dealers. We can give it a chance by ordering a small amount.\"</p><br/><p>\"Right. We have a steady market share, and a small amount will be swallowed up in a few days.\"</p><br/><p>In other words, they had reached a conclusion.</p><br/><p>When they looked up again, the host had announced enthusiastically the opening of the formal wear show. Music started playing. Qin Guan encouraged Ouyang Fen, who was following him, \"I\u2019ll be up on the stage. Don't freeze up when you get on after me.\"</p><br/><p>You took the words right out of my mouth! Ouyang Fen almost choked as he gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan arranged his outfit one last time and murmured, \"The legs are too short.\" Then he got on the T stage.</p><br/><p>The bright white lights hit his grey suit, making it shine like silver. His puritan outfit turned seriousness and inflexibility into suppressed sensual passion. It was a bold move by the designer, who was aiming at a younger target group.</p><br/><p>With a vertical sense and a tight fit, the traditional western-style clothes looked casual. The opening show model attracted the audience's attention. When Qin Guan reached the first half of the stage, Ouyang Fen stepped onto the stage as well.</p><br/><p>The grey and black contrast was particularly clear on the white T stage. The audience was still fixed on Qin Guan as the rest of the models got on the stage one by one. At the most significant part of the T stage, Qin Guan struck a pose, supporting his legs and promoting the atmosphere to the fullest. Inside the dim hall, people's eyes looked like shining bulbs.</p><br/><p>Heated discussions broke out as Qin Guan returned backstage. \"What handsome outfits! I\u2019ll place an order!\" the dealers commented with feeling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It's Indecent!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lan Editor: Efydatia</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan finished his lunch box on his last day on set, Li Shaohong stopped her work and came and patted him on the shoulder in encouragement.</p><br/><p>\"According to our rules, any actor who dies in the play gets a bonus.\"</p><br/><p>With a chicken leg in his mouth, Qin Guan smiled. His eyes had narrowed into tiny slits. Li Shaohong didn\u2019t say much to him. The boy is very intelligent, but he\u2019s silly in everyday life. He made friends with everyone in the crew. Maybe I will give him more chances in the future.</p><br/><p>After bidding farewell to the crew, who had taken care of him every day, Sister Xue received a bonus of 200 yuan.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan started his Cherokee, he opened the window and told Sister Xue, \"Add all possible terms concerning income to the contract. Films, animation, advertisements. Otherwise, you\u2019ll suffer losses. The share can be the same as on model jobs. Don\u2019t look down on it!\"</p><br/><p>Although she had an annoyed expression, Sister Xue felt warm in her heart. She handed the bonus back to Qin Guan and patted his car. \"Don't worry about it. The play is finished, so you can just relax. I won\u2019t accept any new jobs for you. You have exams, right?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled proudly as he showed off. \"I\u2019m the No.1 student at my college. I\u2019m well-prepared.\" Before Sister Xue could tell him about the payment for the TV play, he drove away. He was afraid that she would ask for a share of the bonus. That would be 60 yuan!</p><br/><p>When the whole play was finished, Qin Guan would receive his final payment. According to green hand co-star rates, he would get 2,000 yuan for each episode. That would be 16,000 yuan in total, which was pretty good.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not bragging. The four accountants he had met last time had passed their exams with his help, and they all took the exam for the junior technical post together.</p><br/><p>The two subjects, Primary Accounting Practices and Basic Economic Laws would be over before noon. They were all at the same skill level, so they finished their papers without any trouble.</p><br/><p>They had been planning on treating Qin Guan afterwards, but he had already left. They still had his phone number though, so they decided to help him in the future if he needed anything.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had won their friendship. (Of course, the author is not encouraging cheating here.) If one helps others, others will help them in return.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's schedule was tight that day. He had to go to Huang Jiajia\u2019s house for a quiz. He had been too busy to finish her papers.</p><br/><p>Besides, it was one of their few lessons before the College Entrance Examination, and he wanted to complete their over one-year long courses.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Qin Guan spread the papers in front of Huang Jiajia, proud of his own work.</p><br/><p>Chinese: 123</p><br/><p>Math: 99</p><br/><p>English: 118</p><br/><p>Physics: 100</p><br/><p>Chemistry: 105</p><br/><p>It was 545 in total, which was three points below the minimum passing score for college admission.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was excited. The first time he had met Huang Jiajia, she hadn\u2019t even been able to score 300 points. Judging by her current achievement, the rebellious girl had made great progress.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia remained calm as she stared at the papers. Actually, she was one of the best students at her school, and she had high hopes of getting into a pretty good college.</p><br/><p>However, her goal was the Capital University of Finance and Economics, which required 670 points even for students in the capital. Tears started falling on the papers without any warning as she began to sob.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was flustered. What the hell does the princess want? Her score is pretty good, and there is more than a month left to go. With some more effort, she will be able to enrol at a good university!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had a low EQ, so he had no idea what Huang Jiajia was thinking about. He considered her tears a sign of anxiety over her score.</p><br/><p>He tried to smile kindly as he comforted her. Huang Jiajia embraced Qin Guan and buried her face in his chest. Qin Guan couldn't help but scream.</p><br/><p>The girl cried out as tears and snot ran down her face. After the entrance examination, she would have no excuse to stay close to Qin Guan. Her first love would have brushed past her.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked and annoyed by the young girl\u2019s feelings. She had a soft body and a sweet-smelling breath. He had the impulse to retreat. Even an idiot would have known what was going on. He touched his forehead and said in his gentlest voice, \"Huang Jiajia, let me go, okay? Let's have a talk.\"</p><br/><p>(Is this what you call a gentle warning?)</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia cried even louder. Her love was one-sided. My single-minded, silly teacher won\u2019t reciprocate my emotions.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't know where to put his hands. He dared not touch Huang Jiajia. As he hesitated, Huang Jiajia's mother came in to see why her daughter was crying. She entered the room and saw Qin Guan hugging Huang Jiajia.</p><br/><p>They looked at each other for a second before she left quietly.</p><br/><p>Her mother is different. Why doesn\u2019t this naughty girl take after her?</p><br/><p>After less than a minute, Huang Jiajia's mother entered again with a stick. She pulled Huang Jiajia away with one hand, and then waved the stick towards Qin Guan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

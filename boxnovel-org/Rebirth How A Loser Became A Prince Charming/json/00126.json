He raised his eyebrows slightly and asked the photographer to take a photo of him and Qin Guan first.</p><br/><p>Actually, he had no reason to be angry. Qin Guan would only have two photos in the inner pages, while he was an exclusive Rayli model.</p><br/><p>He was attractive to female readers, and people called him a male ladybro. His gentle-neutral face was his trademark.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan chuckled to himself at the news. He rushed to the fitting room, while Shao stayed in the studio silently, waiting for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan came back wearing jeans, Shao smiled to himself.</p><br/><p>I win! Models of similar style usually took photos in outfits of the same collection. Shao was in a pure white shirt and casual pants, which made a sharp contrast with Qin Guan's clothes.</p><br/><p>Shao knew that the theme of this photoshoot was the countryside. Qin Guan\u2019s tough-man style was Rayli's first experiment. It was a brave change, as most of the readers were shy girls.</p><br/><p>The two of them stood in the frame surrounded by grass and wild flowers. With a smile, Shao Xiaobing leaned towards the centre, leaving little space for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could only lean to the side, turning his profile to the camera. Before the confused photographer could say anything, Qin Guan picked up his cowboy hat from the grass, leaned towards Shao, and put the hat on his head.</p><br/><p>They were back to back, leaning against each other to create a tough-soft contrast. The tassels hanging down from Qin Guan's hat swayed around his face.</p><br/><p>The boy seemed more cool and resolute, setting off Shao's delicate, charming nature.</p><br/><p>It was a perfect photo.</p><br/><p>The photographer made an \"okay\" sign to them. Shao turned his head around and stared at Qin Guan coldly.</p><br/><p>\"Is it uncomfortable for you? I\u2019m actually a tall, strong guy myself.\"</p><br/><p>His bluntness alerted Qin Guan, who realized that the seemingly nice guy was actually hostile. Qin Guan didn't care about the reason. I\u2019ll stay here until the very end!</p><br/><p>(Where did his confidence come from?)</p><br/><p>Then he stabbed another knife into Shao's heart, \"Thank you for supporting a younger model's work. You know, I actually have another job today. Help me finish this one earlier,\" he said, bowing before Shao happily.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your support!\" Qin Guan shouted loudly with all his might, making sure that everyone around them heard him clearly. They all made favorable comments about his behavior.</p><br/><p>\"Such a polite young man is rare to find these days.\"</p><br/><p>\"True. He seems like a nice boy.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan received unexpected praise.</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing could do nothing but smile reluctantly. He watched Qin Guan go into the fitting room in a carefree manner.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wouldn't stop laughing in Sister Xue's car. He analyzed the whole situation with Sister Xue and realized Shao had only been nice when he had replaced him as the main show model.</p><br/><p>As the victim, Qin Guan felt unreasonable enmity towards him. It was unfair. Sister Xue thought it was normal. There was always drama at a workplace. The cake was not big enough for every model to have a piece. Suppression meant power.</p><br/><p>The best way to fight back was by growing beyond the opponent's reach. Wasting time on meaningless fights was foolish.</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing felt like an idiot. His seemingly smart brain had fallen into a muddle. His agent had accepted all domestic annunciates with a certain publicity. He was expanding his popularity crazily, aiming for him to reach a level where he could work for brands.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, he would be taking Qin Guan's jobs. It was like killing two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>Frowning, his agent said nothing, hoping that Shao would lighten up his heavy workload.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was completely relaxed. He was dressed like a top model, the white curtains of the French windows serving as foil for the brightly-colored wine glass in his hand.</p><br/><p>ELLE photoshoots were famous for their luxurious and elegant style. It took the photographer more than ten minutes just to fix Qin Guan's shirt cuff, let alone all the other details.</p><br/><p>The curtain was blowing too high against the wind. Again! The lights did not give off a mysterious enough vibe! Again! Qin Guan's foot was 0.5 centimeters off. Again!</p><br/><p>By the time they had finished one photo, Qin Guan\u2019s forehead was covered in sweat. Yi Yan, who was free and had come to watch, proudly told Sister Xue about her idea. Nobility and good taste would be dominant in the pictures. Their photoshoot would be different from Rayli's, who engaged in cheap concepts. They served only the top of the top.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue could only nod. The two photos took Qin Guan one hour. She was speechless.</p><br/><p>Against the setting sun, Qin Guan got in Sister Xue's car, holding a pancake roll. His eyes were filled with tears from starvation.</p><br/><p>The pancake was steaming, so he had to pass it from hand to hand. \"Hot! Really hot!\"</p><br/><p>Inside the roll were soft, shredded potatoes and fresh bean sprouts, as well as carrots. He was surprised to discover chicken tenders in the middle. Sister Xue had ordered that especially for him.</p><br/><p>In the cool autumn, nothing could be compared to the fragrance of meat. Licking the sauce left on his fingers, Qin Guan burped in satisfaction. The two-yuan roll had been the best choice to fill his stomach.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

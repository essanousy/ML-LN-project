He is so handsome! That's why he won over the heart of the goddess. We should just admit defeat.</p><br/><p>His taste is pretty good too. Where did he buy that shirt? It\u2019s amazing!</p><br/><p>Hey, guys! What the hell kind of taste do you have?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned in the direction Cong Nianwei was pointing at. When he saw Chi Hailin, he smiled.</p><br/><p>When Chi was closer, Qin Guan asked Cong Nianwei, \"Do you have a tissue?\" Cong Nianwei took a tissue out unconsciously and handed it to Qin Guan. Qin Guan blew his nose with it and folded it into a small ball, waving it at Chi. Before Chi could explode, Qin Guan threw the ball into a dustbin nearby and looked at him innocently.</p><br/><p>The girls had no idea about what had happened before. What they saw was only a deep malevolence between Chi and Qin Guan. Their evaluation of Chi suddenly changed for the worse. Yes, you have pursued Cong Nianwei with perseverance, but she already has a boyfriend. You\u2019ve been too vicious to her official boyfriend. You\u2019re quite an unreasonable guy!</p><br/><p>Chi's face changed numerous colours in a moment. His best friend did not have good vision, as he was the one to provoke Qin Guan first.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, you! That\u2019s right, you! Are you Cong Nianwei's boyfriend?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. This is a rash fellow with some poor provoking skills. Qin Guan kept silent, waiting for his next words.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re so...\" He looked at Qin Guan's face. \"So\u2026 so handsome.\" Then he scanned Qin Guan's figure and continued unconsciously, \"Your figure is excellent, and your taste is unique.\"</p><br/><p>Cold sweat ran down his forehead. He had originally wanted to sneer at Qin Guan and make him shrink back, but he couldn\u2019t find any shortcomings on him. He is perfect.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he realized his biggest advantage. \"But your studies...\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei knew what he was about to say. \"He studies at the Capital University of Finance and Economics,\" she said, pointing at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The boy changed his attitude at once. \"And your studies are pretty good. You are the perfect man. Could you show Chi some mercy and give up Cong Nianwei?\"</p><br/><p>Some of the girls spit out their water, while others started coughing. They were all left speechless by his words.</p><br/><p>That boy is amusing. The boy felt sorry for his incoherent speech and pulled Chi close to apologize before retreating.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin was sad too. As he stood in front of their table, he realized he had nothing to say. He had no argument to provoke Qin Guan with. He was unwilling to give up though, so he asked Cong Nianwei directly, \"Cong Nianwei, today is my birthday. Are you free this evening? I\u2019d like to treat you to dinner.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei looked at Qin Guan reassuringly before she answered calmly, \"Sorry, I\u2019ll be spending this evening with my boyfriend.\"</p><br/><p>After such a clear rejection, Chi returned to his table despondently, without any appetite for his birthday banquet. His best friend tried to cheer him up, \"Don't get discouraged. When her boyfriend leaves, she may have time to have dinner with you.\"</p><br/><p>The others couldn't stand him anymore. His EQ had to be below 500.</p><br/><p>\"In fact, you never confessed your love to Cong Nianwei. She may have no idea that you love her. You have waited for more than a year, and now she has a boyfriend. You could try to make a formal confession. If you get rejected, you can put a formal sentence on your love. At least your emotions will be worthwhile.\"</p><br/><p>His encouragement made Chi Hailin resolute. I\u2019ll confess my love to Cong Nianwei this evening! Qin Guan had no idea about his plan. If he had the ability to predict the future, he would snuff out that fire while it was still a flame.</p><br/><p>During lunch, the girls asked Qin Guan some basic questions.</p><br/><p>They were itching to know more. How did this boy fall from Heaven and unexpectedly win Cong Nianwei's heart? Where is he from?</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, are you the same age as us? How old are you?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put a meatball in his mouth. \"I\u2019m a sophomore too. I\u2019m 19 years old.\"</p><br/><p>\"How did you meet Cong Nianwei?\" All the girls were listening carefully.</p><br/><p>\"We were classmates in senior high school for three years. We were in the same science class.\" Qin Guan swallowed another mouthful of food.</p><br/><p>\"How did you win her heart?\"</p><br/><p>\"I was really charming. At our first meeting, Cong Nianwei was so shocked by my charm that she bowed before me\u2026 Ouch! That hurts! Don\u2019t pinch me! My bad!\" Cong Nianwei had pinched his thigh as punishment for his exaggeration.</p><br/><p>\"Actually, I was pursuing her shamelessly. Then she took mercy on me and promised to be my girlfriend...\" Qin Guan held Cong's hand under the table.</p><br/><p>All the girls were laughing. Cong Nianwei\u2019s boyfriend was so cute. Then they reached the most critical point. \"Which stage are you two at?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked unconsciously at Cong Nianwei, who was drinking sweet corn soup calmly. I have to be careful. Anything I say may get me in trouble. I feel like a soldier on a minefield. Qin Guan answered carefully, \"I hold her hand.\" Then he pretended to be shy, implying that he was still a pure boy.</p><br/><p>(You old dog! Don\u2019t act like a green hand. Actually, you are pretty old.)</p><br/><p>The girls found this funny. \"So you are that innocent! Just holding hands? You are not in kindergarten! You have to be positive, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"His face is red. What a shy boy!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

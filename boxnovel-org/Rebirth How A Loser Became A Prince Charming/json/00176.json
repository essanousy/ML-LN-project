I have a rich experience on printed media, runway shows and TV advertisements. I have been a model for J clothing, Two Sung, and LEE. I have also been on the inner pages of the Chinese ELLE, and I have played roles in two popular TV shows. Besides...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made a pause there. If Sister Xue, who was quite familiar with him, had been there, she would have known that he was about to surprise everyone.</p><br/><p>\"There is an old Chinese saying that says that seeing is believing. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll show you my abilities,\" Qin Guan concluded. He stood up in front of everyone and took off all the clothes on his upper body, exposing his bare chest.</p><br/><p>All the ladies screamed.</p><br/><p>The waiting models were surprised. How could he audition like that? What a brave man!</p><br/><p>The experienced director was not surprised by Qin Guan's sudden action. He supported his jaw on both hands and scanned Qin Guan from head to toe.</p><br/><p>Fair-shaped muscles without the stiffness of European and American models. He looks pretty good. Beautiful V-line abs. Pity that he\u2019s still wearing pants... Smooth skin without pores, perfect Asian characteristics, light hair, drops that fall down his body...</p><br/><p>He rubbed his jaw. Before he spoke, Qin Guan opened his mouth again and said, \"You should see the expression of the girls at my college when they see me. Just look at these ladies.\"</p><br/><p>\"If your company hires me, they might be willing to buy that body wash not just for their boyfriends, but also for themselves. It will smell like me after all!\"</p><br/><p>The director cast a glance at his assistant.</p><br/><p>The girl was a classic workaholic. She was pretending to read the documents in her hand though, but her eyes were actually fixed on Qin Guan's bare chest.</p><br/><p>The director made a decision immediately. \"Great! Young man, you\u2019re hired! You convinced me!\"</p><br/><p>The representative secretly gave Qin Guan a thumbs-up. Thank goodness! I don't need to spend another day serving an unreasonable client.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put on his clothes again. The Adidas assistant licked her lips unconsciously as she saw the beautiful outline of his back and waist.</p><br/><p>The director thought it was time to leave, before his excellent assistant turned into an indecent woman.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, on the other side, went to see the representative for the medicine advertisement.</p><br/><p>The second advertisement was quite simple. There was always the same line in patulin ads: \"If you catch a cold, get a runny nose, or spike a fever, please take XXX cold medication.\"</p><br/><p>He just had to play a weak patient. It was a piece of cake for Qin Guan, who used to pretend to be sick to skip classes in his past life.</p><br/><p>His partner was the mother of the representative from the medicine plant, which saved them a larger investment.</p><br/><p>The old woman looked like a gracious lady until she saw Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>As a housewife crazy for TV shows, she was familiar with all hit shows and the advertisements broadcasted between every episode.</p><br/><p>She was a fan of Qin Guan, and she thought of him as a boy from her neighborhood.</p><br/><p>She had originally agreed just to do her son a favor, but now she got serious about the job. I won't encumber the boy! What's his name though? I wasn't able to find it in such a long list of cast members!</p><br/><p>The woman asked Qin Guan straightforwardly, and he told her his name considerately, making an even better impression on her.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was lying on the couch feebly with a red nose. There were used tissues all around him. The woman ran in at full speed and bent over him, shouting anxiously, \"What's the matter, son?\"</p><br/><p>\"Cut! What are you doing, sister? Your son has just caught a cold, he\u2019s not dying! Don't look so nervous. Just slightly worried is okay. You went too far with your performance.\"</p><br/><p>Her son looked around awkwardly. He thought his mother was doing this intentionally, just to have more contact with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>No one was that strict with a green hand though, so they began once more. The old woman did better next time. She read her lines precisely with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Then she and Qin Guan held the medicine box up and shouted towards the camera like idiots, \"Good curative effect for colds! XXX is the best!\"</p><br/><p>The advertisement was finished, and the woman was pulled away by her son, waving farewell at Qin Guan with his autograph.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw her off before rushing to his next interview.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, he turned his head around unintentionally and saw the rearranged set. There was a giant queen-sized bed there.</p><br/><p>The A. M. staff noticed Qin Guan\u2019s curiosity and told him, \"It\u2019s also for a kind of medicine. Are you interested?\"</p><br/><p>\"What medicine?\" Qin Guan asked without thinking.</p><br/><p>\"Huiren afrodyn. They pay high for models, about twenty percent more than others.\"</p><br/><p>\"Forget it, let's go.\" Qin Guan was afraid that he would fail to resist the lure and take the job.</p><br/><p>He went to another audition instead, which was even more exaggerated.</p><br/><p>Adidas limited their candidates to models, but that biscuit ad was more loose on the selection.</p><br/><p>There was a hodgepodge of printed media models, advertisement models, actors, and green hands from talent agencies.</p><br/><p>Their method was also strange. They focused on one\u2019s ability rather than their resume.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

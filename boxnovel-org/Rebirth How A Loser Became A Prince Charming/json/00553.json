Cong Nianwei was thinking that she was an architect, not a painter.</p><br/><p>Hilton went on, \"As far as I know, the painter didn\u2019t hand her own card to you. She found me, because she saw a picture of us together. Her agent thought we were close and was hoping that I could extend an invitation to you.\"</p><br/><p>\"She is a charming woman and the most famous illustrator in America. Her name is Tasha Tudor and she is an old lady worth our respect. We have become friends and collaborators, so I was hoping that you could act as her model, as a friend. Please!\"</p><br/><p>Hilton became more and more serious as she talked. Qin Guan felt strange.</p><br/><p>\"Why? Is there any compelling reason that she wants me in particular?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. She is 79 years old, but still working. After watching your film, she saw something in you that matched her new series of countryside illustrations. She wants you to model for her latest work. Will you do this favor for an old woman?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan's schedule is very tight...\" Cong Nianwei, who had a favorable impression of artists, reminded them.</p><br/><p>Hilton was full of energy though. \"She said that she prefers to live and work in leisure. He can go to her studio anytime he likes.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei exchanged a look. \"Okay! Give me her contact information.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Great!\"</p><br/><p>Hilton gave Qin Guan a piece of paper as he stood up. \"We have reached two agreements. Is there any time left to negotiate about the Hilton Hotel?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. Our finance department and legal team are ready to proceed. Shall we go?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, we\u2019ll be just in time. Our gallery is quite close to your hotel.\"</p><br/><p>As he sat in the meeting room of the Hilton Hotel, Qin Guan noticed the doubtful expression on the manager\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>What the hell is Paris doing? She can fall in love with this Adonis, but she can\u2019t invite him into the family business. Besides, who the hell is this QC accounting firm? It\u2019s a small firm with an income of a mere couple hundred thousand dollars. How dare he try to take over our business! Are they kidding me?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan remained calm. Paris was on his side after all.</p><br/><p>They introduced themselves to each other with their tongues in their cheeks. Then the manager began his attack.</p><br/><p>\"Ms. Hilton, the Hilton International Hotel Group is a branch of the Hilton Group. Our business functions independently. We have 403 hotels all over the world. According to our sources, Mr. Qin Guan\u2019s firm is not qualified to work with us in terms of scale or manpower. You may be Mr. Hilton\u2019s heir, but we cannot meet your unreasonable demands.\"</p><br/><p>He tried to make the princess shrink back, but the girl gestured impatiently, interrupting his long speech.</p><br/><p>\"Who told you that I want to trust Mr. Qin Guan with our whole business? I thought I made myself clear. I just said that I would put his firm in charge of the hotel on Times Square. Understand? Only that one! Do you think that a small firm wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it? What would the staff of all the firms on Wall Street think if they heard you?\"</p><br/><p>\"As far as I know, half of our business is being run by those small firms. Or does this mean that some firms are bribing you? I\u2019m just talking about one of our 403 hotels! Don\u2019t blow everything out of proportion!\"</p><br/><p> Now that Qin Guan\u2019s influence on her had worn off, Paris restored her reputation as a capable heir. Sweat had formed on the face of the manager.</p><br/><p>\"If you have gotten the approval of the senior executives, I would like to see the relative documents. I\u2019m responsible for this and I think a larger firm would be a safer choice.\"</p><br/><p>Hilton realized that the rigid manager was about to surrender. She was no longer intimidated by him. \"Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get the relative documents in a couple of days. Our chain of hotels might seem like a shark, but it has grown up from a small fish. Even KPMG started small.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

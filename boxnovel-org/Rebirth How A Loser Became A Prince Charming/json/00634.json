The number on the contract had surprised her.</p><br/><p>\"Lao Liu, this is beyond our budget. Even the smallest house in this area would cost us more than a million! You are working at a bank. We could borrow some money from it, or maybe take a look at some other property...\"</p><br/><p>Lao Liu signed his name on the contract without looking up.</p><br/><p>\"I make money for my wife and kids. This house is close to the school and my bank. I will save money on transportation and food. Besides, it's also close to your parents...\"</p><br/><p>\"But...\"</p><br/><p>Liu was a man of his word. As he followed the salesman to go on with the purchase, his wife finally stopped complaining. She knew her husband was a considerate man deep down.</p><br/><p>There were so many paths on a person's life that one could lose their way. One day though, something or somebody would remind them of what really mattered.</p><br/><p>A moment like that was worth cherishing.</p><br/><p>The manager saw the two families off respectfully. When she turned around, she met the sparkling eyes of several girls.</p><br/><p>\"Tell us, Elder Sister!\"</p><br/><p>\"Tell you what?\"</p><br/><p>\"About Qin Guan! That was Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>They all twittered happily, leaving the manager speechless.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Zhang, get me a glass of water.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\" Xiao Zhang rushed to the water dispenser as fast as she could.</p><br/><p>\"I'm getting old. My back is always sore after work.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll massage it for you!\" another girl offered.</p><br/><p>\"That's enough! We've had many powerful people buy a house from us before!\"</p><br/><p>\"But they were old people working on Financial Street! Qin Guan is much more handsome!\"</p><br/><p>\"Tell us, please!\"</p><br/><p>The manager was satisfied with the effect.</p><br/><p>\"What do you want to know?\" Suddenly, they all began quacking like ducks.</p><br/><p>\"Was that girl his girlfriend? Are they going to get married? I saw their parents with them!\"</p><br/><p>\"You are right...\"</p><br/><p>They all sighed in disappointment.</p><br/><p>\"They're going to get married? But he is so young!\"</p><br/><p>\"I know!\"</p><br/><p>The manager shot them a supercilious look.</p><br/><p>\"He is only 22 according to his ID, but there's no need to be anxious. I think they are a perfect match. Besides, even if he didn't marry her, it would be impossible for him to marry any of you.\"</p><br/><p>\"That hurt!\"</p><br/><p>The manager took a sip of water before she stood up.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, break is over. Qin Guan is not that famous anyway. He is just a handsome advertisement model. Is he famous for his work? No! Has he won a national prize or something? No!\"</p><br/><p>She had made a big mistake.</p><br/><p>\"He has won two Best Actor Awards in Europe!\" the girls shouted.</p><br/><p>The manager was straightforward. \"But he's won nothing in China. Now stop talking and go sell some more houses!\"</p><br/><p>The girls scattered like frightened birds. The manager let out a long sigh of disappointment.</p><br/><p>\"Young girls are always like this. Celebrities are useless!\"</p><br/><p>In late September 2003, SARS was put under control in China, people lost an important star of the Chinese film industry, and a new singer rose to fame in Taiwan and became popular all over Asia.</p><br/><p>In 2003, both the Chinese film and music industry eventually emerged from underwater. In the fall of 2003, Qin Guan had to see the two people he loved the most off again.</p><br/><p>His parents left some new cotton padded quilts and local snacks for them. No matter where Qin Guan was, he could always feel their love.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei received a call and hurried out, leaving two large suitcases in their room. The call was from the real estate agent who rented the compounds on the Second East Ring.</p><br/><p>The alley Qin Guan had bought was about to be evaluated for the first time. The couple rushed to the agency to meet the young employee.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

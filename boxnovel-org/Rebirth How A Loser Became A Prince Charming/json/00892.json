He was already above the standards of an award-winning actor. Only an Outstanding Contribution Award could match his talent.</p><br/><p>Even if he didn't get the award now, he would eventually win it after a few decades. The organizing committee had decided to add brilliance to his present splendor by awarding him with this international honor.</p><br/><p>A hero was nothing but a product of his time. The Japanese always admired heroes, so all the judges had reached the consensus to give Qin Guan the award.</p><br/><p>As a result, Qin Guan's speech was now irrelevant.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, everyone was too distracted to pay any attention to what he said on the stage. Both the audience and the reporters were considering the consequences of this award in the future, as well as how to profit from this event.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his speech by expressing his gratitude and waving the golden award with the symbol of Sakura. Everyone stood up to cheer for him. There was no doubt that he deserved this.</p><br/><p>Yamaguchi Tsutomu pressed the remote control to turn off the TV. She could finally relax again after being nervous for so long.</p><br/><p>\"They still have some good taste left...\"</p><br/><p>Her sigh faded away along with the image on the screen.</p><br/><p>On their way back, Qin Guan and Wang Liying didn't say anything. They were still shocked by the recent events. The fukubukuro from Yamaguchi Tsutomu was still in Wang's hand. Does it even work?</p><br/><p>The amazing news had gone viral right away. The next morning, they took the earliest flight back to Beijing to deal with the impending media storm.</p><br/><p>As soon as they arrived in Beijing, Wang hurried back to the office. Everything was in order. Wang had just pulled her luggage into the office, when she saw Sister Xue sitting behind her desk calmly.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Sister Xue. Did you release the news about Tokyo?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Was there any negative feedback?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was happy to see the worry on Wang's face. The girl was really dedicated to her job. She could trust Wang completely now and retire to the backstage.</p><br/><p>She asked Wang to sit down and showed her Qin Guan's secrets, including his fan club, Yamaguchi Tsutomu and their story in New York.</p><br/><p>Even after reading the main reports and latest news online, Wang was still shocked by that final secret.</p><br/><p>Now she understood why those controversial news hadn't caused them any trouble in Japan. All the Japanese media, both right wing and left wing, had praised the film festival's decision. Qin Guan had the support of an entire nation.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, some Asian countries such as South Korea were complaining about the award and debating over the real meaning of an Outstanding Contribution Award. Should it be based on seniority, contribution, or something else entirely?</p><br/><p>The Chinese media remained calm. Qin Guan had won the award after all. No matter what everyone said, China would never return the award.</p><br/><p>Those contemptible scoundrels returned without accomplishing anything. The organizing committee of the Busan Film Festival, which had ended one week before the Tokyo Film Festival, felt frustrated.</p><br/><p>Their entertainment industry had made great progress during the past few years. They had even accumulated fans from Europe and America!</p><br/><p>The Busan Film Festival was trying its best to expand its influence and compete against the Tokyo Film Festival. In their opinion, the Tokyo Film Festival just copied material from others and presented it as its own. It was the last 9A-level film festival of the year after all.</p><br/><p>The Koreans laughed at the deteriorating Japanese entertainment circle. Japan's prime time was gone with the wind. They also looked down upon Japanese taste, arrogance and everything else they could think of. They expected that one day the Busan Film Festival would become the best festival in the Asian film circle.</p><br/><p>These news were a huge blow for them. All their effort was gone with the wind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Of course, that's only what it felt like to the onlookers. She actually only looked at him for one second.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, let's go!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's charm could persuade anyone. He could certainly earn a woman's blind love. Even if the woman in question was lying in a grave, she would still stand up if Qin Guan ordered her to. He had managed to bring to life the playboy of the original work.</p><br/><p>Xu went home with Qin Guan, leaving Huang Jue at the ball. Qin Guan still hadn't recognized her. The next morning, he gave her the same excuse he had years ago.</p><br/><p>\"I'll be back after my business trip.\"</p><br/><p>Xu was not as broken-hearted now as she had been when she was younger. She put on her fur coat, pinned a white rose to her hair and left with her handbag.</p><br/><p>He had never recognized her, which had made her feel hurt all over again.</p><br/><p>The romantic story and the plain music only irritated Wang. \"Damn!\" she said angrily. What a scumbag!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a lot like a relentless web novel protagonist. Wang, who was a loyal web novel reader, lost interest in her favorite stories after the shooting.</p><br/><p>She was lucky enough to understand the situation though and become one of the most prophetic readers. Much later, she would write articles like \"The Fall Of The Stone Horse\" and \"Defeating Stone Horses\", which would become a strange beam of light amid the web novel community. Her loyal fans would also soon become Qin Guan's fans.</p><br/><p>Of course, this would happen much later. At the moment, Qin Guan was still performing.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the woman's letters, he knew that he had a son he had never met with a woman who was deeply in love with him. His sorrow was so strong that it penetrated his bones.</p><br/><p>Thick clouds covered the moon as everyone gathered behind the camera nervously. \"Camera!\" said Xu, who was sitting calmly among them.</p><br/><p>The camera zoomed in on Qin Guan with a mechanical arm. Qin Guan was wearing a blue robe and a Chinese jacket and holding a thick stack of papers in his hand. He was standing in the dark, far away from the lamp.</p><br/><p>As he clenched his fists tighter and tighter, the flat papers twisted and wrinkled like a helpless lover. Qin Guan's sorrow began to flood his entire body.</p><br/><p>No! It's not true! It's impossible!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan bounced up from the couch and walked to the meeting hall. From the corner of his study, he could see the small house across the street clearly. It was that woman's house. That was where she had fallen in love with him.</p><br/><p>As her vague figure suddenly became clear in his mind, his heart started hurting and a bitter roar struggled out of his throat. His roar eventually turned into a peaceful sigh. That was how the story ended.</p><br/><p>By the time the long scene, which lasted about three minutes, was completed, the women on the set were sobbing silently.</p><br/><p>\"What a sad story. Only when the heroine died did the hero realize she had been his true love. He will have to live a miserable life from now on...\"</p><br/><p>\"Pure love goes beyond life. If Qin Guan were to fall in love with me, I'd lay down my life for him...\"</p><br/><p>Wang pointed out their mistake, aiming straight at the heart of the matter.</p><br/><p>\"Why would you fall in love with such a man? He wouldn't even remember you!\"</p><br/><p>Her words brought everyone back to reality. She is right.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a surprised look at the girl. He liked her clear mind and ability to impress his fans. Besides, she had a keen insight into such matters. She would certainly become a good assistant someday.</p><br/><p>When everyone finished packing, Wang led them to a restaurant not far away, where they could have a celebratory dinner party. She had negotiated with the cunning owner and reserved the entire restaurant for two hours so they could experience the real charm of Sichuan Cuisine.</p><br/><p>She had chosen that restaurant mainly for its delicious pickled Chuan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

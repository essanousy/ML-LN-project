She applied several drops of massage oil to his face to soothe it.</p><br/><p>In a few minutes, everyone had calmed down. Qu sized Qin Guan up to confirm that he was well. Then she told the director to go on.</p><br/><p>The models were more careful the second time around. When the bottle was pasted to Qin Guan's face, the director stopped the shooting.</p><br/><p>After that emergency, the girl could finally cheer up. She was admired by everyone. A good psychological state was a necessary quality for an outstanding model. She was worthy of public attention.</p><br/><p>Qu still insisted on her conspiracy theory though. After sending Qin Guan home, she focused on all the details of that day. There must be something strange going on.</p><br/><p>Everything had to be taken into consideration. It was difficult for her to discover the truth by herself though. She wanted to entrust the case to a professional.</p><br/><p>Detective agencies, also known as research firms, were illegal in China. In some foreign countries though, they could formally register with the government.</p><br/><p>Most of them employed retired policemen, professional lawyers and veterans. Resourceful people from all walks of life. With enough money, one could get the result they wanted. Sometimes, they were even more capable than the police.</p><br/><p>As the street king, Xu Xiaoxiao accepted the case without hesitation. Qu asked him to clarify the situation. Was there anybody after Qin Guan? Was that accident a coincidence or not?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't keep the accident in his memory. He returned home and got into bed right away. In his past life, he had worked with machines, concrete and steel bars at construction sites. Wounds were like medals for men. Qin Guan showed the mark off to Cong Nianwei and got some unexpected feedback.</p><br/><p>\"A medal? You are not a soldier. You are not defending the nation or protecting public property. Do you know what your wound is?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan winked. \"What?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei put her heavy bag down on the desk. \"A disfigurement.\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Qin Guan fell on the bed again. When he shot a secret look at her, he noticed something strange.</p><br/><p>\"Show me those leaflets.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei handed them to him. He was so busy with work that she could only see him in some important classes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan read the leaflets and realized he was out of date. They were about an academic trip during summer vacation. He had known that he was included in the list. </p><br/><p>\"What does this mean? My tutor said that I was shortlisted.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was busy with her design, but she still had time to answer his questions,</p><br/><p>\"It's organized by several American colleges. They choose some outstanding students to travel to all the colleges during vacation. That way, students have the chance to see different environments. The activity promotes academic research and science. You could think of it as a club for talented students.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sensed the joy in her tone. \"So you\u2019re also going?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Cong Nianwei nodded. \"I like it. I would get to travel to different campuses and enjoy the beautiful view and food of different places in America. Plus, I will be meeting very famous professors. Good students always have a lot in common. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt sad. He had been planning on spending vacation in his apartment, drinking beer and watching TV. He wanted to sleep for a whole week. It seemed like he had to go with Cong Nianwei though.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a pity that my girlfriend is a straight-A student.</p><br/><p>\"This is strange. Why am I included? I\u2019m not talented.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan cheered up. I\u2019m just an accountant.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei stopped drawing and cast a supercilious look at him. \"What's the icon of Disney World?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mickey Mouse.\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right. Top colleges like to compete with each other over sponsors, talented students, awards and sports. You are the representative of Columbia. I heard that you would be the leader and emcee. Did you read the letter carefully?\"</p><br/><p>So, I\u2019m like the grandpa with the white beard on the KFC logo? Columbia is proud of me because I\u2019m a handsome award-winning actor?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt deep sympathy for the childish college administrators. After their long conversation, Cong Nianwei concentrated on her design again. Qin Guan wanted to tease her.</p><br/><p>He craned his neck toward the desk.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing, Wei? Your handsome boyfriend is here. Why are you still looking at that paper? My heart is bleeding! I need first aid!\"</p><br/><p>He tried to pull the paper away, which usually worked, but failed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

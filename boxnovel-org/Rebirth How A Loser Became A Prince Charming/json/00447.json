Girls of senior and middle school were fighting over NYLON copies. Qin Guan\u2019s fans were searching for film tickets at high prices. If they knew what he was doing at the same time, they would have died.</p><br/><p>What was Qin Guan doing? He was digging in his toes with a finger in the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had prepared beer and cold dishes and turned on the TV for the evening CBO show.</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up, Qin Guan. Your series will be on soon!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wei, come and rub my back. I can find no bathhouse or feet trimming experts in New York. What if I opened a bathhouse?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei cast him a supercilious look in the misty bathroom. \"Bad idea. American people would never go there. Besides, where would you open it? In Chinatown? It would be meaningless!\"</p><br/><p>\"Han Zhujiu could take care of the security... Stand still!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Awesome! I feel lighter now. On the right... Yes\u2026 Lower...\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei\u2019s cheeks were as red as cherries.</p><br/><p>They sat together amid the steam, with a bath towel covering their bodies. Qin Guan\u2019s first TV series had just started.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>On the screen, Qin Guan and Samantha were fighting like monsters, while on the couch before the TV, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were...</p><br/><p>Bending over his bare chest, Cong Nianwei let her long black hair hang down on her fair shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"We missed the show.\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s just the boring love life of an American woman.\"</p><br/><p>\"But I wanted to watch your erotic scene...\"</p><br/><p>\"It was clumsy. There\u2019s nothing to see. It's true. Just go to sleep...\"</p><br/><p> Feeling guilty, Qin Guan stretched his arm out under her head to make her more comfortable.</p><br/><p>He had done that on purpose. A jealous woman was the most terrible thing in life. As he thought of that, Qin Guan felt extreme pain on his thigh.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were the only ones who had missed the episode. The target audience of \"Sex and City\" were mainly housewives and white-collar workers, who sat before their TV early at home. Even if they were at work, they didn\u2019t forget to turn on the TV.</p><br/><p>Samantha was their favorite character. She was the brightest point of the show. They wondered which man would be her next prey.</p><br/><p>The sixth season would be the final one. The first episode didn't disappoint the fans. A fresh face appeared on the screen.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! He\u2019s so handsome!\"</p><br/><p>\"Picky Samantha is good at choosing a man.\"</p><br/><p>Countless young men and women, who were deeply in love but unable to fulfil their desires, admired Samantha\u2019s love hunting skills. Some female OMG users thought that the stockbroker looked familiar. They paused the show and looked at Qin Guan carefully. Finally, they recognized him.</p><br/><p>The VOGUE on the couch had Qin Guan\u2019s photos on the back cover. On the shelf was a picture of Qin Guan from the Oscars on the cover of NYLON.</p><br/><p>OMG was full of posts about Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Did anybody watch \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 tonight? Were you satisfied with it?\"</p><br/><p>\"The only highlight of the first episode was Samantha\u2019s new boyfriend. Can anyone tell me his name?\"</p><br/><p>\"I read through two fashion magazines and found an Easter egg.\"</p><br/><p>\"I want to know the connection between \u2018Elephant\u2019 and \u2018Sex and the City.\u2019\"</p><br/><p>The last post shocked all the users. Yes, they were indeed the same person.</p><br/><p>The indie actor had guest starred in a popular TV series! More striking news followed.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, Chinese. Actor of \u2018Heroes\u2019, which was nominated for Best Foreign Film. I saw him on the Oscars red carpet.\"</p><br/><p>There was a riot. What? The Oscars?</p><br/><p>The 75th Oscar award ceremony had had the lowest audience ratings.</p><br/><p>\"\u2018Heroes\u2019 will be on in July all over USA. I read the news on IMDb...\"</p><br/><p>American internet users were searching everywhere for information. Now that they had found a mysterious treasure, they couldn\u2019t help but explore even deeper.</p><br/><p>There were stars shining in Vivian\u2019s green eyes as she sat before her computer. Worship me, you worldlings! You will never know the true world of my idol!</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is a talented Columbia student. He came to the US six months ago and got his AICPA. He has his own independent accounting firm. He is really winning at life.\"</p><br/><p>It was like a bomb thrown into a small, shallow pool. The fish, shrimp and mud at the bottom were destroyed by the explosion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

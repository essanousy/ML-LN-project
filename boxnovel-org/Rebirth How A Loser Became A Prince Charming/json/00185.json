After a long time, there was a pot of soup left. The restaurant\u2019s business was flourishing because of it.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was among a group of men who were eating and sweating. Nothing could compare to a delicious meal after a busy day.</p><br/><p>Actually, there was something. A good salary!</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan returned to the studio for his last scene. He would get paid soon.</p><br/><p>Finally, Cai Jing was defeated in a political struggle. He was degraded and exiled to the borders. He died on his way there due to the hardships he went through.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was lying in a torn carriage with dry lips. He was seriously ill. Looking in the direction of the imperial city, he closed his eyes reluctantly.</p><br/><p>The script assistant nearby was sobbing. Her eyes had nearly swelled.</p><br/><p>Why do those evil guys kill all the characters? The hero's fiancee and parents all died for the heroine. Why don't you die instead? Leave Master Cai alone!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished the scene without any trouble. \"So much for Cai Jing! Let\u2019s applaud him!\" the director suggested. He was happy, as Qin Guan had added glamour to the funny show.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got an extra bonus. This was one of the advantages of a generous production.</p><br/><p>There was also an advantage to being a supporting actor. If the crew got to know you, you would have a steady flow of jobs.</p><br/><p>Fang Pingping walked up to Qin Guan as he was packing his things. She touched his bag on the ground with her tiptoe. \"Why don't you stay longer? You could at least attend the celebration.\"</p><br/><p>\"I have another show to shoot. And another one after this. I\u2019m really busy these days.\"</p><br/><p>Fang looked at him in surprise. \"You work harder than me! Do you want to make a living in the entertainment circle?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, I\u2019m a college student. I only act in my spare time. Besides, if I wanted to join the circle, I\u2019d have to attend all the social activities.\"</p><br/><p>Fang felt insulted. \"I\u2019m a nobody in the circle. Ever since \u2018Prince Pearl\u2019 [1], I have gotten lots of main roles, but I couldn\u2019t impress the audience. \u2018Prince Pearl\u2019 has limited my choices.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled to himself and comforted her, \"In two years, you\u2019ll be a superstar! I have faith in you.\"</p><br/><p>With the development of the internet, you will define the beauty standards of a whole generation. You will make the pointed face popular.</p><br/><p>The girl seemed happy with Qin Guan\u2019s flattery. \"It's unrealistic to have such a handsome guy praise me. I have to fight for success. I have to become more famous so I can help you. We are schoolmates after all!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan opened his arms, and they hugged each other farewell.</p><br/><p>\"It was nice to meet such a considerate boy while I was feeling so low. Stop! Stop! This is not goodbye forever. I have your number, young man. I will call you and invite you to social gatherings! Oh, I wanted to ask you a question on behalf of my female schoolmates. Do you have a girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes,\" Qin Guan answered unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Fang Pingping smiled. She patted Qin Guan on the back and winked at him. \"Me too.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was stunned. \"You have a girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p>Before Fang could raise her fist, Qin Guan walked away, looking back and waving his arms at her. Fang waved back at him with a smile.</p><br/><p>I have to work hard today. Shall I see him after work?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at another studio there was a different show, way more interesting than \"Grace Princess\". The assistant director was interviewing actors. It was said that the play was just a way for the producer to promote his lover.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan passed the audition and checked out the crude props. The set was simple, and the actors were horrible. It was really bad.</p><br/><p>The salary for each episode was 1,000 yuan higher than other shows though, so Qin Guan decided to stay.</p><br/><p>The title of the show was \"Female Servants of the Red Mansion\". Just as it implied, it was a play about women. The scriptwriter kept changing the plot all the time.</p><br/><p>Normally, female servants like Yuanyang and Pingr would be beauties of different styles, so Qin Guan had expected to see beautiful girls there. Alas, there were none.</p><br/><p>Wang Xifeng was standing in the middle of the set with Pingr, who would have a romantic relationship with him. Wang looked like a middle-aged woman. They were both looking at Qin Guan with open nostrils, as if they were nymphomaniacs.</p><br/><p>The other servants, Ningr, Huar and Duor, looked even worse. Qin Guan couldn't even bear to look at them.</p><br/><p>He began to defend Jia Lian, his character, against that injustice. His character was supposed to be more beautiful than any girl in the show.</p><br/><p>He didn't say anything when he got his costume. As a childe of the Duke Mansion, he had to dress like a junkman.</p><br/><p>Even at \"Romance Across Time and Space\", Gao Fuming\u2019s costume had been top quality. When Qin Guan saw one of the other actors though, he suppressed his annoyance. At least he would suffer alongside a future superstar.</p><br/><p>This was not Hang\u2019s lucky day. He was a drifter in Beijing, playing tiny roles in every production, and an acquaintance had introduced him to this studio to play a manservant.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! He would be playing Qin Guan\u2019s manservant, who was mentioned once or twice in the original work. To Hang's pleasure, he would have some lines. More than one actually!</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] A popular TV series in the early 2000s.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

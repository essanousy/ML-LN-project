All the cameras from different directions turned to Qin Guan. Qin Guan was stunned, but he maintained a poker face. Actually, he had thought he was just a guest at the ceremony. He was completely taken aback by the news...</p><br/><p>Sister Xue looked even worse. Snot was silently running down her nose. There\u2019s so many cameras! I can\u2019t lose face before Qin Guan and all the Chinese people here...</p><br/><p>Everything Professor Li and Teacher Rong had taught her finally took effect.</p><br/><p>Teacher Rong always said that everything could be solved with a smile. Qin Guan smiled and stood up in an elegant manner. He hugged Gus, who had stood up to congratulate him.</p><br/><p>He didn't forget to shake the hand of the Turkish nominee in respect.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left his seat and walked to the stage. All the flashes and the cameras were following him.</p><br/><p>The host gave him a cup symbolizing the highest honor of an actor.</p><br/><p>The Cannes Festival cup was the prettiest among the top 10 international film awards. It had a crystal foundation and it was decorated with beautiful golden palm leaves. The organizing committee had considerately placed the cup in a box, which made it more convenient to carry.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan took it, a nameless emotion surged in his heart. He held the cup tightly.</p><br/><p>Actually, he was concerned about his career as an actor. It had only been an experiment for him before, but now he was worried about the critics\u2019 comments on his work. Actually, he was always waiting for recognition from others, even if it was just an insignificant praise. Deep in his heart, he was expecting to get something back. The cup was an acknowledgement of his effort.</p><br/><p>He turned back with the cup, facing the audience under the stage. They were all people who had devoted themselves to indie films. And they were all cheering for him.</p><br/><p>He felt pure happiness. He took a bow before them and pulled the microphone up a little. He stood as straight as a pine in the snow.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, everyone. I know I\u2019m a stranger to most of you. I\u2019m Qin Guan. I\u2019m from China and I\u2019m an actor.\"</p><br/><p>The man looked elegant and handsome, like a traditional Chinese painting. He had been a misfit all his life, but he exuded a strange sense of comfort.</p><br/><p>He sp\u03bfke neither too fast nor too slow. His voice was clean and deep. Everyone could feel his excitement.</p><br/><p>\"I think I\u2019m daydreaming. All the faces of the talented people in the audience seem like a dream to me. I pinched my own thigh to make sure. It still hurts!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>The serious atmosphere became merry. What a funny, lovely guy!</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019d like to thank my director, Gus Van Sant, who picked me among a lot of actors and helped me through the whole process.\"</p><br/><p>Gus was about to cry again. As a director, any award for his film was a recognition for him.</p><br/><p>\"I also want to thank the crew, who worked really hard for my career behind the scenes. They always trusted me.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue covered her face with a handkerchief. The camera turned away from her, respecting her privacy.</p><br/><p>\"I want to thank all the nameless heroes behind me. Without your silent support, I would never have made it this far.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was watching the live broadcast online. She felt like laughing instead of crying. Xu Xiaoxiao, Lan Jin and He Ming, who were watching the ceremony on TV, were really happy. Yes, we did help him a lot.</p><br/><p>Rongzhi was the most shameless though . Bro, I\u2019ll always be your silent supporter.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about their blessings. He was just expressing his sincere feelings.</p><br/><p>\"Some of my old friends, who were really talented directors, tried to change my mind. They told me that my face was not for indie films.\" Suddenly, Qin Guan smiled.</p><br/><p>The talented audience, which included directors, stars, producers and French ministers, saw him smile clearly on the large screen. His smile was like a feast in Heaven, like every flower blooming at the same time.</p><br/><p>\"See?\" Qin Guan continued. \"My face is too handsome for indie films.\"</p><br/><p>\"I never realized the power of my face until now, when I\u2019m standing on the stage of the Cannes Festival, accepting an award. It is right only for the best films, as well as the best actor... Ha ha...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

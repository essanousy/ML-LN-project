When they were all gone, Sister Xue fell back against her chair and began beating her chest and stamping her feet.</p><br/><p>She was really jealous of the contracts, which provided favorable enough terms for a second level star. I\u2019m treating you fairly, Master Qin. I could have sold you at a high price just now, but I didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>The bosses were calm when they received the reports, but they suspended several actors. Good luck to them. They had to depend on their own skills now.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s refusal was a symbol of pureness in the entertainment circle. Some actors, who were frustrated with their talent, finally saw the light.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was chatting with Huang Bo, who was about to get a bonus that day. His character would commit suicide soon.</p><br/><p>As an NPC, Huang Bo was sitting by the road, watching the final scene between Qin Guan and the protagonist.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing a black gown and shining golden armor and sitting in a cave where treasure was buried. Huang wanted to ask if Qin Guan was a close relative of the prop master. His costume was the best one in the whole play.</p><br/><p>Holding the order flag with both hands, Qin Guan sat up before Chen Youliang\u2019s [1] deadee.</p><br/><p>The director zoomed in on his sad face. The cameraman was speechless. This is discrimination.</p><br/><p>The director had his own reasons. The audience ratings would be raised by 0.01. That was the truth. The biscuits advertisement, where Qin Guan's face had occupied the whole screen, had seemed like a makeup advertisement.</p><br/><p>\"Camera!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan read his lines in a heart-breaking tone. \"My lady, the young lord has betrayed you. I have the order flag, but I\u2019m powerless.\" He closed his eyes in grief and indignation.</p><br/><p>Disregarding his sorrow, Consort Shu criticized Gao loudly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stared at her in disappointment.</p><br/><p>\"I had originally planned on killing Zhu Di, but he died. I can drop the idea of becoming queen forever now!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan closed his eyes, tears falling down.</p><br/><p>Huang Bo was shocked. What a wonderful actor! He cries so naturally. Qin Guan continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\"Gao Fuming, return with me and admit your guilt,\" the heroine tried to convince him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan laughed crazily. Huang was learning from him.</p><br/><p>Everyone had a good opinion of Qin Guan. Gao was a loyal man, but he had a really stupid master.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan laughed miserably before he said loudly, \"I am a patriot, and I\u2019m loyal to the throne. You should be feeling guilty. You are the one who betrayed our country!\"</p><br/><p>By then, the assistants and script girls watching Gao Fuming had tears in their eyes. They could feel the extreme despair of failing to dedicate oneself to one\u2019s country.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan cried before the deadee, \"My Lord, I\u2019m coming! I\u2019ll die with everlasting regret!\"</p><br/><p>He threw the order flag up to the sky, took out his sword, and touched his neck with the sharp blade.</p><br/><p>All the shots were close-ups, without exception.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan supported his body with the sword as he kneeled before the deadee. His eyes were wild, and his armor was shining. This was the last glory of his miserable life.</p><br/><p>As one girl stopped crying, another one started. The director waited for a long time before he shouted, \"Okay!\" The cameraman cast another supercilious look at him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up on his aching knees. Huang Bo walked up to him.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, bro. Wonderful acting! You started crying just in time!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked around and whispered to Huang, \"I\u2019ll tell you my secret. You can have tears in your eyes in ten seconds.\"</p><br/><p>\"Just close your mouth and take a deep breath through your nostrils. Just like a yawn. Don't open your mouth though.\"</p><br/><p>Huang did as Qin Guan told him.</p><br/><p>\"Hold up and blow out slowly through your nostrils, just like holding in a yawn. Your nose feels sour, right? Tears must be on the corners of your eyes now!\"</p><br/><p>\"If you want the tears to start flowing, just repeat the process.\" Huang listened carefully. It\u2019s so simple! It\u2019s much easier than triggering my emotions!</p><br/><p>Sister Xue smirked in disdain. Lazy guys like Qin Guan used their high IQ to come up with tricks. He must have thought really hard about this one.</p><br/><p>After sharing his secret with Huang, Qin Guan tried to take off his armor. \"What are you doing?\" the assistant director asked him.</p><br/><p>\"My part is over. I have to go to another filming studio.\" The female servants were all waiting for him.</p><br/><p>\"You have to play the corpse!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put on his helmet again speechlessly. Who added that part? Why not something better? I know your plan! You just want to shoot my face! I don't care as long as you pay me!</p><br/><p>Huang wanted to laugh again, but he held his laughter back. He had to ask Qin Guan for a lift to the next studio.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] Chen Youliang (1320-1363) was one of the leaders of the peasant uprising at the end of the Yuan Dynasty.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

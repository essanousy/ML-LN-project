Meanwhile, his fans were discussing the film happily on his blog and on OMG. He pointed to the computer. </p><br/><p>\"Never believe the gossip you read online.\"</p><br/><p>There were many posts about the details of the film. People analysed the film carefully, especially its sex scenes. Some fans even asked Qin Guan what he had thought of Julia\u2019s big mouth. They were jealous of him, which made Cong Nianwei even angrier.</p><br/><p>\"Why do you always go for these wild indie films? Not every indie film needs to include a sex scene! You have many choices. There are family films, war films... Be careful with your choices in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay!\" You are the boss! Your punishment is like honey for me!</p><br/><p>People made fun of henpecked men, but they loved their women very much. There was a wide gap between men and women when it came to strength. They were not afraid of their women. They just respected and loved them a lot.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At Miramax\u2019s invitation, Qin Guan attended the 53rd Berlin International Film Festival. His film had been nominated for an award.</p><br/><p>The festival had started in the early 1950s and made an international impact by the late 1980s.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s film proved once again to people all over the world that it didn't need any intervention from external forces, be that a nation, politician or public figure.</p><br/><p>A good film was enough to be liked by people all over the world.</p><br/><p>The Berlin Film Festival was one of the top film festivals in Europe. Compared to Cannes and Venice, it was much younger and more energetic.</p><br/><p>The award season was always changing so it could compete with the other two festivals, but this didn\u2019t influence the passion of the participants.</p><br/><p>Frustrated by his loss at the Oscars, Zhang Yimou had placed his hopes on the Berlin Festival.</p><br/><p>As expected, his film was on the list of nominees. However, he had failed to invite Qin Guan to the festival. This was because another film that featured Qin Guan as the main actor had also been shortlisted.</p><br/><p>As a result, he had to walk on the red carpet alone. He had also seen the name of another Chinese director on the list, one that he was not familiar with.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't recognize the name either. The guy, whose name was Li Yang, was smiling at him. His hair reached his shoulders as he hugged Qin Guan around the neck.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I hear that you are the most popular Chinese indie actor overseas. Would you be interested in cooperating with me?\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang was an easy-going man. No one, inside or outside China, had heard his name before though.</p><br/><p>\"Are you the director of \u2018Blind Shaft\u2019?\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! You must have recognized me at first sight.\"</p><br/><p>He was actually a very handsome man. Qin Guan nodded.</p><br/><p>Li Yang laughed shamelessly. \"Good! Even Qin Guan thinks I\u2019m handsome. I must show off on your blog about this!\"</p><br/><p>\"Blog?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! The forum on your official blog. I have been studying in Europe lately, so I noticed you when you won the Best Actor Award in Cannes.\"</p><br/><p>\"You have made your own way in the field of artistic independent films through hard personal effort.\"</p><br/><p>\"People in the circle think that all geese are swans. They don\u2019t like to be exposed to the media, but you are famous here...\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang pointed at the crowd. Qin Guan looked in that direction. Everyone, regardless of whether he knew them or not, were waving at him.</p><br/><p>\"Hi, Qin Guan. I watched your film. It was excellent!\"</p><br/><p>\"Indie films for the win!\"</p><br/><p>I\u2019m so popular in Berlin? My dream has finally been realized!</p><br/><p>Before he could tear up, Li Yang interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\"Shall we go out for dinner? My treat!\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\" Qin Guan answered happily, looking at Li Yang in confusion. \"Do you know your way around here, director?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha! Are you looking down on me? I came to Germany in the late 1980s to study. First, I studied in Berlin, and then I attended the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. My major was Drama. Several years ago, I got my Master\u2019s Degree on directing in Cologne.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do I know my way around here? Just follow me!\"</p><br/><p>He actually knew everything about the European film culture. That explained why Qin Guan hadn\u2019t recognized his name. The film \"Blind Shaft\" was surprisingly his first film.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What was Qin Guan\u2019s style? Didn\u2019t a model have to have their own style and favorite brands?</p><br/><p>For example, Ouyang Fen liked formal wear for masculine men, and models from the Plaster Flag Nation preferred novelty and ethnic brands with original designs.</p><br/><p>As for the Pickle Nation, their models liked to audition for elegant, gorgeous brands.</p><br/><p>The guy had to be crazy. He had chosen everything, from formal wear to casual wear, leaving nothing for others. If they asked him why, Qin Guan would tell them that he was attracted by the high pay. His roles on TV hadn\u2019t earned him international popularity, so the designers would pay him according to his level.</p><br/><p>He would still get 40,000 yuan for nine shows in only nine days though!</p><br/><p>No sooner said than done! When the designers opened their offices, the models took action.</p><br/><p>Models from the Pickle Nation started whispering to each other, expressing their disbelief over Qin Guan's over-confident strategy.</p><br/><p>The models from the Plaster Flag Nation were also looking at Qin Guan, who they had considered their opponent. A model without a clear identity couldn't be taken seriously as a rival.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was in no hurry. He even invited Ouyang Fen to join him for the fast interviews, but Ouyang refused impolitely.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that all the models at the square saw him as a common enemy. It was not just Asian models. Several European and American models also wanted to beat him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan confronted all the other models. He picked the brand Te-Tiger, which would be the hitting the show on the first day, as his first choice.</p><br/><p>The brand had started by doing fur design. After 20 years of accumulation and development though, it had become a top luxury brand. It had issued a collection of evening dresses, Chinese wedding dresses, and bridal veils.</p><br/><p>As a domestic brand, it would present on the first day of the Fashion Week. Different groups of models chose it without prior consultation.</p><br/><p>The small interviewing room was soon filled by models who wanted to rob their most dangerous rival of this opportunity.</p><br/><p>The interview was very fast. The top designer was a strong man. People could hardly believe that such elegant, splendid designs had come from him.</p><br/><p>The models from the Plaster Flag Nation began to audition. With a strange smile on his face, the designer said only two words when they finished, \"Short legs!\"</p><br/><p>It was like a sword through their chests. Such a strong personality! After the models from the Pickle Nation finished their show confidently, the man once again said only two words, \"Small eyes!\"</p><br/><p>He dismissed the models angrily. Those two countries are shameless! Qin Guan read through the material, looking for the subject of the opening show. It was cheongsams and Han costumes, the background of the brand founder. Suddenly, he understood.</p><br/><p>The founder had been born in Northeastern China. The concept of the show was to honor the memory of traditional Chinese culture. Models who were unclear on those boundaries and history did not qualify for the show. The designer seemed to be a young nationalist.</p><br/><p>European and American models were cleverer. They skipped that brand automatically.</p><br/><p>It was time for the domestic models to compete on individual abilities. Qin Guan felt strange, as he was the last one to get an interview notice. Actually, he had arrived just in time.</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing was observing the situation from the corner of the fitting room. This had been his trick. There were lots of models, but once the designer selected the right model, the others would have to leave without auditioning.</p><br/><p>The whole domestic modeling circle would be participating in the event. There would be 36 male models and 36 female models in the opening show. It was the traditional Chinese concept of six multiplied by six, which was supposed to maintain harmony. More and more models got an offer after the interview. Qin Guan\u2019s chances were getting smaller.</p><br/><p>The designer was tired. He counted the models that were left. There were still three vacancies, but the models waiting outside were more than ten. Compared to the female models, the domestic male models were a lot less, and their figures differed a lot.</p><br/><p>The designer didn't want to waste any time on inferior models. He asked his assistant to move all the sundries out of the hall and invite all the waiting models inside.</p><br/><p>After all the candidates had formed a line, he said concisely, \"Anyone shorter than one hundred and eighty-six centimeters, out!\"</p><br/><p>Several annoyed models left.</p><br/><p>The designer pointed at two guys in the line. \"You and you, wrong height. Out!\"</p><br/><p>Good sight! One of them had been 185 centimeters and the other one had been wearing a pair of padded shoes.</p><br/><p>Than he glanced at the models\u2019 legs. \"You, you and you, out!\" No reason. He just didn't want models with short legs.</p><br/><p>\"You and you, out!\"</p><br/><p>Five more models had been weeded out. There were only four models left in the studio.</p><br/><p>The designer massaged his eyes as he examined them. He pointed at Qin Guan and said, \"Leave your resume and get the timetable from there.\"</p><br/><p>Is that all? Did he get an offer just like that? Shao Xiaobing frowned. It took me about 20 minutes to pass the interview, and I used my connections to get on the show. How could Qin Guan pass so easily? Does the designer think he\u2019s picking Chinese cabbages in a street market? He didn\u2019t even ask him to perform!</p><br/><p>Actually, the designer hadn't skipped the performance. He\u2019d fixed his eyes on Qin Guan as soon as he\u2019d entered the room.</p><br/><p>The model had an elegant walk, an attractive figure, a sophisticated style, and a handsome face. He would be the prince in the yellow gown! An interview would be unnecessary. The designer was adamant.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was glad. He had won his first battle.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was enjoying a cup of iced coffee at the outdoor coffee stand. Qin Guan handed her the first notice under the admiring gazes of the other agents.</p><br/><p>Then he went to audition for his second brand. It was a brand from Singapore, and a group of models from the Plaster Flag Nation and the Pickle Nation had already filled all the vacancies.</p><br/><p>The designer felt deeply sorry for missing out on such a good model. Qin Guan got a business card from him before he left gloomily.</p><br/><p>When he got back to the square, Piao and Xiaoquan\u2019s models smiled at him subtly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Chinese and American trainers exhausted them. Taking advantage of his relations, Qin Guan invited Alexander to China. He was the best runway trainer after all.</p><br/><p>It was unwise to stand still and refuse to make any progress in the fashion circle. A communication and cooperation between the two countries had now begun.</p><br/><p>Their effort was soon rewarded. Two more designers selected by Qin Guan were accepted by the Paris Fashion Week. Their dream would begin from a small-scale press conference.</p><br/><p>They were now ready for Paris.</p><br/><p>Paris was the capital of France and the second largest city in Europe, but the whole world still thought of it as the city of romance. The city was full of tasteful ancient buildings, noisy crowds and abundant narcissism.</p><br/><p>Nothing affected its beauty though. Paris was like a gorgeous, shy aristocratic maiden. It was a proud peacock in the daytime and a dissolute creature at night.</p><br/><p>Artists mixed art with conservative culture, unified welfare with extreme individualism, and bright realism with vigorous romanticism. Those strange combinations had withstood the test of time. It was a wonderful experience to live in a land full of miracles.</p><br/><p>It was only in Paris that people were brave enough to use famous historical buildings like the Louvre and the Jardin des Tuileries as fashion event locations. Only the French had dared to build a floating bridge on the bank of the Seine for a fashion show.</p><br/><p>As night fell, Qin Guan's team did not have much time left. Thanks to Qin Guan, eight Chinese reporters would be following them around during the fashion week. This had been unthinkable before, although ELLE, VOGUE and Marie Claire were branches of international magazines.</p><br/><p>This was because of the method the organizing committee used to send out the invitations. They sent 30% of the invitations to celebrities and VIPs of the fashion circle, 30% to influential media moguls, 30% to top buyers, purchasing agents and rich businessmen interested in fashion, and 10% to various others.</p><br/><p>The unknown stars that did not qualify for an invitation could get one by using their connections or money.</p><br/><p>The event was really exclusive, but the first row of seats were the most important. All the guests would stare at the people sitting beside them.</p><br/><p>There were always uninvited guests though. When Qin Guan arrived in Paris, he turned off his phone, for fear that some Chinese agencies might ask him for help.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't avoid Fan Pingping, who was waiting for him outside his hotel room.</p><br/><p>Fan Pingping was not as young anymore, but she was still a charming mature woman. She stretched a hand out towards the surprised man, as if they were old friends.</p><br/><p>\"A gentleman would kiss my hand in Paris. Won't you?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to his senses and took a few steps back. Then he dialled a number on his phone.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Xue, send Wang Liying over. Yes, I have a female guest. It would be indecent for me to be alone with her.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue sounded alert at the other end of the line. Her voice came through the receiver.</p><br/><p>\"Wang is coming. Keep the door open. Who is there?\"</p><br/><p>\"Fan Pingping.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wang, quick!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue hung up. Fan was shocked.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing, Qin Guan? You've changed so much!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't feel ashamed. When he saw Wang rushing over to them, he invited Fan in.</p><br/><p>\"Come in, please. You must have an assistant or agent with you. If this is official business, you can just let them in.\"</p><br/><p>Fan seemed to struggle, but Wang was on guard for any possible danger. She smiled guiltily as she walked into Qin Guan's luxury suite.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Qin Guan! Well done! We haven't seen each other for a few years! You can afford a presidential suite now! How much money have you made?\"</p><br/><p>Fan looked jealously around the room as she sat down on the couch. In two years, the dispensable man she had known had ascended so high that she had to look up at him now.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she made up her mind. Clenching her fists, she explained her purpose for visiting her old schoolmate. She thought they were on the same side after all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

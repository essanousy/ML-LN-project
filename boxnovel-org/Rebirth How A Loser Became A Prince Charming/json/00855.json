The logo \"Li Ning\" made it pretty clear.</p><br/><p>\"Nice to meet you, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Nice to meet you...\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm Zhang, the director of the track team of the Chinese General Sports Administration. I'm not a businessman or a celebrity, so I won't beat about the bush. You've come here especially for Liu Xiang?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Qin Guan nodded in confusion.</p><br/><p>\"Do you think everyone should pay close attention to and support outstanding athletes? Liu has just made a breakthrough for Asians and broken an international record after all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right! Such a sports star needs understanding and help from all fields. As you know, it is hard for athletes to sign contracts with agencies or businessmen. It's said that you have connections both in China and internationally. I was wondering if...\"</p><br/><p>He was actually afraid of being cheated by businessmen, but this was nothing for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>As a patriot, Qin Guan agreed without hesitation. \"I'll give you my phone number. You can ask your staff to contact my assistant. I know everything about most fashion brands. If you choose one, I could contact them for you for free!\"</p><br/><p>\"Great! Thanks a lot.\" Director Zhang was satisfied with the result. Before Qin Guan could say goodbye to him, a Chinese reporter ran over to them happily.</p><br/><p>The reporter shot an excited look at Qin Guan and whispered something to Director Zhang. Zhang nodded repeatedly. Then Qin Guan was presented with an even more exciting proposal.</p><br/><p>\"As you know, Liu Xiang has just broken the world record. There is still some time left before the official press conference. Would you like to take a group photo with our athletes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\" Xu Xiaoxiao replied before Qin Guan could. His lifelong dream would finally be realized.</p><br/><p>Thus, everyone entered the backstage lounge, where Liu Xiang was excitedly waiting for the press conference to start.</p><br/><p>\"Come here, Liu Xiang. Let me introduce you two. This is Qin Guan, he is a fan of yours. He came to Lausanne especially for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"And who is this gentleman?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm Xu Xiaoxiao, an American-Chinese loyal fan of yours. You are the pride of Chinese people all over the world!\" Xu rushed over to shake Liu's hands.</p><br/><p>Liu grinned at them. Who is Qin Guan? Is he a celebrity? I am too busy training every day. Some girls from the women's team mention him from time to time though. He is an award-winning actor! It's great to have such a big star as a fan...</p><br/><p>The reporters from the Xinhua News Agency and CCTV frowned at Xu, who was standing in the middle.</p><br/><p>\"When shall we take the photo, sir? And how?\"</p><br/><p>\"Now! Like this! Make sure we look handsome!\"</p><br/><p>Xu felt like he was on a cloud as he stood between Qin Guan and Liu Xiang, hugging their shoulders. He looked like a small apple between two tall bananas.</p><br/><p>Miserable, yet memorable.</p><br/><p>The reporters pressed the shutters as fast as they could and tried to ignore the short guy in the middle. When they were done, they shook hands with Qin Guan and Liu Xiang.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your cooperation.\"</p><br/><p>\"Was that okay?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, you can get back to your work.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pulled Xu out of the lounge so he wouldn't follow Liu Xiang to the press conference.</p><br/><p>Then he returned to his hotel and sent the photos to his firm. To his surprise, the news about Liu Xiang went viral online. By the time he boarded the plane for Spain, the pictures had spread all over the country.</p><br/><p>\"The No.1 Asian at track races! Liu Xiang breaks the world record with 12.88 seconds and pushes the human limits!\"</p><br/><p>\"Lausanne! Liu Xiang's lucky place!\"</p><br/><p>\"The award-winning actor personally beats the drum for Chinese athletes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Liu Xiang and Qin Guan's friendly photos! The two of them seem to know each other well!\"</p><br/><p>The strange photos had sneaked into the sports section.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

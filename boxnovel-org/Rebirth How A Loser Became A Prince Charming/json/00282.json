The film was still rotating in the camera, making the producer a little nervous. The whole crew was surprised. There had been no mistake. Why had the director stopped them?</p><br/><p>Zhang Yimou asked Zhang Weiping to watch the playback with him.</p><br/><p>Zhen Zidan looked full of momentum in his yellow gown. The black and white pieces on the board left a profound, lasting impression. The rain created a gloomy atmosphere in the camera. When the camera turned to Qin Guan though, they burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>On the large screen, any small detail would be clear to the audience.</p><br/><p>Li Lianjie\u2019s face, which was full of bumps and holes, and Chen Daoming's wrinkled face had a historical value to them. With Qin Guan as a contrast though, Zhen Zidan, the second lead of the film, suddenly looked like a nobody. That was reasonable. Zhen was famous for his martial art abilities, while Qin Guan was a model relying on his looks.</p><br/><p>However, that made it seem like Changkong, the top assassin, was a peasant in the fields and the leader of the seven swordsmen was the important man.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's face was too attractive. It made him stand out among martial artists.</p><br/><p>Zhang Weiping was interested in his looks though. \"Wow! He would be great for commercial films. All the girls would pay to see his face. I\u2019ll find a script for him.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yimou didn\u2019t answer. His original intention had been for Qin Guan to act in this film.</p><br/><p>\"Give him a moustache!\" he shouted to the makeup team. \"Apply some dark powder, too!\"</p><br/><p>He had to reduce Qin Guan's presence to match the whole film.</p><br/><p>The dresser got to work reluctantly. As he applied dark powder on Qin Guan's face, he complained about the director\u2019s taste.</p><br/><p>\"Alas! All beauties have fair skin. You look like a peasant with that make-up on.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to bear with his kind chatter.</p><br/><p>\"Okay! See for yourself.\" The dresser sighed and pasted a fake beard above Qin Guan's lips with a frown.</p><br/><p>You are destroying a beauty, director.</p><br/><p>When they were done, Sister Xue saw Qin Guan change into a less handsome guy. He was still above average though.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to the set and stood next to Zhen Zidan again. Everyone unconsciously compared the two actors. It was the first time they saw a supporting actor that was too handsome to play with the second lead.</p><br/><p>Zhen wanted to cry out. It\u2019s not my fault I look common. I\u2019m a martial arts star! I\u2019m not relying on my appearance!</p><br/><p>The scene started over. The background was dark and the building was made of grey bricks. Qin Guan matched them harmoniously. Director Zhang felt pity for the boy. He had promised to direct a publicity film for the National Tourism Administration, which would be broadcasted in foreign countries. Maybe I could give him a chance in that film. He is a Chinese beauty after all.</p><br/><p>Soon he came back to his senses. \"Camera!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tightened the black headband around his forehead. The camera was getting farther and farther away to reveal his whole body. He was sitting straight on his heels opposite Changkong with both hands on his thighs. It was the prelude of their duel.</p><br/><p>The crew gestured to the extras, who ran and got into position. There was one camera following them while the camera fixed on Zhen was still filming.</p><br/><p>With his long hair covering his face, Changkong said coldly, \"The seven superiors of Qin...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his sentence, \"...have been following you for days. We\u2019ll bring you to justice.\"</p><br/><p>His voice echoed inside the hut.</p><br/><p>\"Show your spear to confirm your identity!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked ahead of the other six actors.</p><br/><p>The action director had spent a lot of time on selecting actors of similar height. Qin Guan was still the tallest one among them though.</p><br/><p>Zhang Weiping fell in deep thought again as Zhang observed Qin Guan through the camera.</p><br/><p>He was standing straight. The long bronze sword and thick grey gown didn't influence his posture. It was an advantage he had as a professional model.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed the sword at Changkong, the criminal they were after. His body was as straight as a rod. Director Zhang pointed the camera at Zhen for a second and then moved it back again, avoiding the contrast with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>They were at a stalemate for ten whole seconds before Zhang Yimou stopped the camera. The crew was watching the playback while Qin Guan went out, wiping raindrops off his face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

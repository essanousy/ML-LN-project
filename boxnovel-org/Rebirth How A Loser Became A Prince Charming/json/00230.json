Luckily, her body was light, so he fixed his posture quickly. The photographer was waiting patiently for the female star.</p><br/><p>The naughty girl pushed her soft body against his again. Qin Guan dared not move, even though he felt two soft balls touch his back. Her thin silk dress couldn't hide her boobs.</p><br/><p>Kyoko Fukada saw Qin Guan\u2019s neck tighten and his blue veins pulse. She smiled to herself and embraced his waist with her arm, placing her other hand on his back.</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" she said in Japanese.</p><br/><p>She caressed his back gently, murmuring again in Japanese, \"His back is so broad!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s hair stood on end. She thinks I can't understand Japanese. She is teasing me in her language. I know what she\u2019s saying though!</p><br/><p>The photo had a strange emotion to it thanks to her behavior.</p><br/><p>When he saw the pictures, Qin Guan let out a long breath. Thank god my face is not visible. Sister Xue would have been amused by my twisted expression! F*ck! This girl is even worse than Fang Meiya. At least she only used her charm and words to seduce me. This one goes straight to action!</p><br/><p>What was worse, her assistants seemed indifferent to the matter. They saw Qin Guan as another stamp in Kyoko Fukada\u2019s collection.</p><br/><p>It was too dangerous. According to Qin Guan\u2019s small experience with women, with so many foreign and domestic journalists there, the news would spread fast.</p><br/><p>During the break, Qin Guan expressed his worry to Sister Xue. She smiled. \"Are you afraid of your popularity decreasing if girls know you have a girlfriend? Are you afraid you\u2019ll have less female fans?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head hesitantly. \"That has nothing to do with me. I live my own life. This is just a job I took by chance.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue clapped her hands. \"That's it! Just ask your girlfriend\u2026 What\u2019s her name... Cong Nianwei! Ask her to come visit you now if she\u2019s free. She will give enough material to the media.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly understood. He called his girlfriend, who he was anxiously longing for.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei sounded confused. The day before, Qin Guan had told her about the job, so she had been taking notes during their classes for him. Why is he calling me now?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speaking hesitantly. He couldn\u2019t explain to her.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was impatient though. She bowed to the waiting photographer apologetically and grabbed the phone.</p><br/><p>In a few words, she gave Cong Nianwei an idea about the situation. \"Kyoko Fukada and Qin Guan?\" Cong Nianwei asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin, who was sitting nearby, tried to eavesdrop. \"What? Kyoko Fukada? Oh my god! Where is she? Where is she? She\u2019s my dream woman!\"</p><br/><p>He stared at Cong Nianwei like a puppy.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was speechless. \"Is that okay with you?\" she asked Sister Xue. \"Really? Okay...\" She hung up and nodded at Lan Jin helplessly. \"Three rules: keep a distance, keep silent, and be invisible. If you can do that, you can take me there.\"</p><br/><p>Lan Jin nodded energetically, afraid that Cong Nianwei would change her mind. As soon as the tutor dismissed them, he helped her put away her books.</p><br/><p>As they went out of the building though, they saw two students following them.</p><br/><p>\"He Ming? Guan Jian?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei glanced at Guan, who straightened his strong body and coughed. \"Do you need a bodyguard, Cong Nianwei?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei sized the two guys up disdainfully. They seemed gentle under normal circumstances. That\u2019s men\u2019s nature though.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin was excited to see them. \"Keep a distance, keep silent, and be invisible. Can you do that?\"</p><br/><p>The two young guys, who were used to being the center of attention, nodded unconsciously.</p><br/><p>What could Cong Nianwei do? I\u2019ll just take them there. They are Qin Guan's friends anyway.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei nodded and Lan Jin took the lead, running to the parking lot. \"Hurry up! Time is wasting!\"</p><br/><p>When Cong Nianwei got in the Ferrari, which was the same color as Lan Jin's hair, she felt deeply regretful.</p><br/><p>The three cars reached the Citizen offices as quick as a flash.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei entered the building in her casual clothes, followed by the three striking boys. The receptionist led them upstairs with a smile.</p><br/><p>Our boss sure has good insight. The ambassador he chose has such a striking girlfriend. He must be a great man!</p><br/><p>He led them to the shooting studio, just as Qin Guan was coming out of the fitting room.</p><br/><p>He was in an elegant white shirt. The buttons on his chest were all unfastened, revealing a wonderful view.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin whistled at him in appreciation before shrinking back when he saw Cong Nianwei's cold expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

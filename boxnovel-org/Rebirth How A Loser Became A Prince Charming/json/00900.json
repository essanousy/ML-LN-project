Cong Nianwei's father calmed down again. He had prepared to play the role of the mighty father. If the bastard said anything unfavorable about his daughter, he would throw that wrench at his face.</p><br/><p> It would be better for other girls if he disfigured him.</p><br/><p> As soon as Cong Nianwei's father took a seat, Qin Guan poured a cup of tea for him politely. Judging from the fragrance in the air, it had to be black tea, which was his favorite in the winter.</p><br/><p> Okay, Qin Guan was definitely smart.</p><br/><p> Although he enjoyed being served by him, Cong Nianwei's father still wanted to talk about business. He took a sip of tea and got straight to the point.</p><br/><p> \"So why did you ask me to come here?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan rubbed his hands and moved closer to Cong Nianwei's father. It was a psychological trick that was meant to narrow the gap between two people.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei's father bent forward as well.</p><br/><p> \"It will be 2007 next year, right?\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p> \"I'll be 27 years old, which is very close to 30.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p> \"Cong Nianwei is the same age as me.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p> \"She should get married.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes\u2026 No, she doesn't have to rush. She can take it easy.\"</p><br/><p> \"Of course, it's not like she has to worry about marriage. Listen to me, uncle. We have a very good relationship. Like me or not, you have to admit this.\"</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei's father nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Plus, our families also get along well. We have known each other for years. We are a good match, aren't we?\"</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei's father nodded again.</p><br/><p> \"Just imagine, if we got married next year\u2026 Don't look at me like that. I'm just talking hypothetically. If we got married next year, we would have to register at the Civil Affairs Bureau, hold a banquet both in Y City and in America...\"</p><br/><p>\"If Cong Nianwei got pregnant as soon as we got married... Stop! Don't hit me!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan changed the topic immediately. \"What would it be like to have a baby call you grandfather?\"</p><br/><p> A cute baby suddenly popped into the man's mind. The baby was waving at him and calling him grandpa. He almost burst into laughter.</p><br/><p> \"Both of us would be really busy working, so the grandparents would have to take care of the baby. You will retire soon, and so will my parents. We have prepared two apartments for you in Beijing. They are right across from each other.\"</p><br/><p> \"You can raise the baby together.\"</p><br/><p> He is right. That's something worth looking forward to. Oh, no!</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei's father came back to reality. There was a serious expression on his face. \"You haven't even gotten married yet. Why are you talking about a baby? You are getting ahead of yourself.\"</p><br/><p> \"Exactly!\" Qin Guan looked really sad. \"I'm already 27 years old. Even if Cong Nianwei got pregnant right away, you'd have a grandson in one year at best.\"</p><br/><p> \"You are already over 50 years old, despite the fact that you look like 40. It would take 20 years for your grandson to grow up. Wouldn't you want to see him go to college and get a girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p> \"Of course!\" The man immediately corrected himself, \"Why not a granddaughter though? We would prefer a girl! You should never underestimate women!\"</p><br/><p>\"My bad! Wouldn't you want to meet your grandson-in-law?\"</p><br/><p> No. My daughter has been stolen away by a bastard. If my lovely granddaughter was stolen as well...</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei's father suddenly felt as though he had nothing left to live for.</p><br/><p> \"Besides, the optimum reproductive age for women is between 25 and 30 years old. If we waited too long, she would be too old and the whole process would be more dangerous for her. Plus, younger mothers recover faster.\"</p><br/><p> You are really reasonable, young man.</p><br/><p> This was the third time Cong Nianwei's father was nodding. He soon realized there was a reason to argue about though.</p><br/><p> \"Why don't you propose to her as soon as possible then? Are you planning on ditching her?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course not!\" Qin Guan said nervously. \"That's why I invited you here. Every time we've talked about this, she's asked me to wait until my award display was full. Do you know how many shelves that display has? Four! I'm a hard-working guy, but it would still take me two years to fill that display.\"</p><br/><p> \"Your daughter is really serious about these things! That's why I've come to you for help!\"</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei's father put the wrench away and sat up proudly.</p><br/><p>\"You should have gone to her mother. She likes you a lot and she is an easy-going woman.\"</p><br/><p>\"But I thought Cong Nianwei was closer to you...\"</p><br/><p>What a sweet-talker!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although the inside was not luxurious, it was warm. There was a lot of attention to detail, from the mat at the entrance to the soft carpet on the floor. The furniture showed the high standards of the couple's life.</p><br/><p> After waiting anxiously for two months though, William had no time to appreciate their perfect house. He was only concentrated on Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> \"When will you travel to America, Mr. Qin?\"</p><br/><p> \"America? Why? Did I promise you that I would go to America? Okay, let's talk about this. I must wait for my baby and wife to recover one month after the birth. Oh, no. I also have to attend the baby's 100-day celebration. As you know, that's a very important day for Chinese children.\"</p><br/><p> That would be in 2009. Is that right?</p><br/><p> William felt like crying, yet he couldn't produce any tears. The award-winning actor was shamelessly telling him that he would not go to America or shoot the film!</p><br/><p> Before Qin Guan could pull all his hair off, Cong Nianwei said gently, all the while caressing her underbelly, \"You can go to America, Qin Guan.\" What? Am I dreaming? Wow! Is that an angel I see? She must be an angel! Cong Nianwei pushed Qin Guan away. \"Wouldn't this be Qin Guan's first superhero film?\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes. It would be the first time Qin Guan would get a chance to act in a Hollywood blockbuster that uses special effects.\"</p><br/><p> \"I heard that many famous actors were interested in the role before you chose Qin Guan to play the Joker.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes, a lot of outstanding actors were interested in the part.\"</p><br/><p> \"Thank you for being kind to my husband. As his wife, I have to support his career. By the way, if the film is popular, will your company promote it for the Oscars?\"</p><br/><p> \"Of course!\"</p><br/><p> William raised his voice. He knew that this was a key point to solving the problem. Only this argument could convince the lady.</p><br/><p> Nothing was important for Qin Guan, but winning an Oscar was an obsession of his. If there wasn't an important award on the table, he wouldn't leave China.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei nodded. \"I agree. Qin Guan will join you immediately. If I am not wrong, your crew must have already gotten to work.\"</p><br/><p> She was right. That was why William had aged 10 years while looking for Qin Guan. The film had a budget of 100 million dollars. If \"I Am Legend\" could earn nearly 600 million dollars, then so could Batman. The film's box office would be really high!</p><br/><p> I have to stop salivating!</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was confused. Ten minutes earlier, he had been squeezing juice for Cong Nianwei, yet suddenly he had been kicked off to America!</p><br/><p> \"I can't leave you home alone, darling!\"</p><br/><p> \"Did you forget? Our parents will be coming to Beijing today!\"</p><br/><p> \"Weiwei, I'm here! We've brought you plenty of snacks!\" Cong Nianwei's father entered the house, holding packages with local specialties. Qin Guan's parents followed him in joyfully.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was caught off guard.</p><br/><p> \"Dad, mom! What are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p> \"Why are you asking?\" Cong Nanwei's father stared at him. \"I don't need your approval to see my own daughter. What are you doing here? Don't you need to work? A man should work hard to support his wife and kids. I heard that you suspended all your work, which I find completely unnecessary. Now that we are here, we can take care of Cong Nianwei. Go earn some money to buy your baby some milk powder!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

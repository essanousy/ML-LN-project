Qin Guan didn't pay attention to the others. He just stared at Zhuchuan. \"It's boring to talk about business on such a fine day, amid such beautiful scenery. I think you have achieved your aim.\"</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan fixed his eyes on him for a long while, losing himself in his memories. After a full ten minutes, he stood up and smiled. \"You are right.\"</p><br/><p>There was a 20-centimeter height difference between the old man and the young man, but their backs were in harmony as they walked out. It seemed like they were old friends.</p><br/><p>When the two enigmatic men left, Sister Xue and Shanchuan began to debate right away. After three pots of tea and five portions of Chinese dessert, they stopped, contented and aware that the real heroes were not back yet.</p><br/><p>They exchanged a doubtful glance and stood up together. Their rumpling stomachs betrayed their appetite. They changed the topic awkwardly. \"Where did they go?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's meaningless for the two of us to talk, Sister Xue. We\u2019d better find the two decision-makers.\" With a faint smile on his face, the steward led them around the greenhouse and into the master living room.</p><br/><p>They found the two men in the open hall.</p><br/><p>They were playing Go calmly. Qin Guan was using the black pieces and Zhuchuan the white ones. It was a stalemate.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Shanchuan didn\u2019t dare interrupt them. At Zhuchuan\u2019s indication, they approached and stood by their sides.</p><br/><p>\"Finished?\" Zhuchuan pressed a piece onto the chessboard. Shanchuan bowed reverently. \"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's time for chatting. I know the Chinese like to discuss business affairs during their leisure time. I know that. My mother is Chinese, so I\u2019m half-Chinese myself.\"</p><br/><p>Shanchuan was surprised. He hadn\u2019t known about that secret part of his life. He tried to concentrate and lower his voice. \"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>Nothing could bother Qin Guan though. He moved another piece.</p><br/><p>Staring at the board, Zhuchuan said, \"It's difficult to decide about the advertisement in Japan, but I can make a decision about the Asian branches.\"</p><br/><p>He picked up a white piece from the chess basket and threw it down again. Shanchuan wanted to speak, but on second thought he didn\u2019t. Then he said, \"I\u2019ll invite Qin Guan to our show. Let\u2019s take it easy. The ambassador should carry out his duties. I don't care about the headquarters in Japan. We are in charge of the Asian market, so it\u2019s better to have a long-term perspective.\"</p><br/><p>If we look at this from a long-term perspective, we should go with Jincheng Wu. He\u2019s half-Chinese, half-Japanese after all.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s my final decision. Tell me about your price level, my little friend.\" Zhuchuanlongfu saw that he was losing, so he threw the piece back with a smile.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at Sister Xue and sat up straight. \"Five million a year.\"</p><br/><p>Shanchuan nearly spat out blood. That's blackmail! Aflame with indignation, he said, \"Impossible! Our superstar Fantingyashi asked for two million RMB a year! That\u2019s too much!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at him as if he was an idiot. \"Five million Japanese Yen. I was talking in your currency.\"</p><br/><p>Shanchuan calculated quickly in his mind. That's only 300,000 yuan. Great!</p><br/><p>The Japanese were always polite. Shanchuan changed his attitude right away. He bowed before Qin Guan and said, \"I\u2019m really sorry for my impatience. I\u2019m clear about your price now.\"</p><br/><p>He glanced at Zhuchuan and saw his boss nod slightly, thankful for the prices of Chinese stars. They had the right to make their own prices according to the trends of the market-oriented economy.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t have signed a contract with a second-line Japanese star at such a low price. Jincheng Wu wouldn't agree to such a price, but it would be a surprise to hire Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>One year would be alright for him. A year later, he would go to the US and leave the Asian market. It was a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Sister Xue escorted them out and saw them drive away in the distance. Then they high-fived each other in celebration.</p><br/><p>Shanchuan sat beside Zhuchuan and inquired respectfully, \"If you made a decision, I\u2019ll report back to the headquarters and wait for their reply.\"</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan nodded and stared at the scenery outside, which was retreating slowly. \"You must be curious about why I\u2019m so interested in an unknown Chinese star.\"</p><br/><p>Shanchuan lowered his head and replied, \"I wouldn\u2019t dare question you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan reminded me of my mother. She was as beautiful as the young man in the pictures...\" He was lost in memory.</p><br/><p>Shanchuan dared not raise his head. He had to hide his expression from his boss. Liar! If your mother was as elegant as Mr. Qin, why are you so ugly? It\u2019s terrible to beautify memory so much!</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan rested his jaw gently on his hands. \"My mother was like Qin Guan. She was born in an ancient noble family. That's why she could bring me back to Japan.\"</p><br/><p>That\u2019s impossible, Mr. Zhuchuan! Judging by your surname, you have nothing to do with royalty. How could a rich young lady marry a peasant in Kanagawa?</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Shanchuan, Citizen is in danger. We had only one office in Hong Kong back in 1987, but the sales volume had reached one million that year. These days though? More than 10 years have passed, and our sales volume has dropped to no more than 100,000!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

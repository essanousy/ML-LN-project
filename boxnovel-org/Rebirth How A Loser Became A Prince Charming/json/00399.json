What would you do if you went on a date with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019d buy you flowers and take you home personally...\"</p><br/><p>The blonde girl seemed to be familiar with the show. She didn't say anything. She just moved on to the next contestant.</p><br/><p>\"What about you, No.3?\"</p><br/><p>\"Uh, nothing. You would just experience my power...\" No.3 made a sly gesture at the audience. </p><br/><p>The audience burst into laughter. So did Qin Guan. The director cut that part though.</p><br/><p>\"Our show is not like those adultery shows. No dirty jokes allowed! Stop it, or leave.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no choice.</p><br/><p>The secret service man appeared again with a wonderful idea. In fact, it was part of his mission.</p><br/><p>\"You could arrange an exciting trip for the couple. Take them abroad...\"</p><br/><p>\"Where?\"</p><br/><p>\"To Moscow.\"</p><br/><p> Spare my life, brother!</p><br/><p>All the secret service men, including Qin Guan, were dispatched to Russia. To cover up his identity, Qin Guan had to bring the silly couple with him.</p><br/><p>It was a dangerous task during the Cold War.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was sitting in a cafe in Moscow, waiting for someone to get in touch with him. George was standing behind the camera. He was interested in the scene between the two strange partners.</p><br/><p>A beautiful woman pushed into the smoke-filled cafe. She was wearing a light grey squash hat. She was walking neither too fast nor too slow, looking like a fairy in the dark.</p><br/><p>She pulled off her black gloves slowly to reveal her slender fingers. According to the script, she had to stretch her legs as a hint to the American spy.</p><br/><p>A beautiful, elegant leg stretched beneath the table. The black net silk stocking and white heels betrayed the danger.</p><br/><p> Filled with joy and hope, Qin Guan sat down across from the woman.</p><br/><p>\"Is this seat taken?\" he inquired politely. The audience felt slightly drunk.</p><br/><p>His head was leaning close, his eyes shining. His curly hair was touching his cheek. The woman flushed. She drew her leg back and sat gracefully.</p><br/><p>\"No, it's for you.\"</p><br/><p>They looked at each other in admiration. Qin Guan delivered the secret message. \"Helsinki is charming this time of the year...\"</p><br/><p>The woman was stupefied. A rare opening for accosting someone...</p><br/><p>She smiled and nodded. \"Yes...\"</p><br/><p>Silence. I\u2019ve made a mistake.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan remained calm. They looked at each other for a full 20 seconds without saying a word. The camera was still rolling.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grinned and turned his head around. He saw a lonely leg leaning out of the last booth, swaying to attract attention.</p><br/><p>That's the right person...</p><br/><p> \"Sorry!\" Qin Guan said awkwardly. Giving up his graceful manners, he rushed to the last booth, standing there with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\"Helsinki is charming this time of the year...\"</p><br/><p>The heroine was revealed as the camera zoomed forward. Her face was covered by a veil. Her rosy lips were blooming in the cold winter. She looked like an Ice Queen.</p><br/><p>Julia Roberts, the beauty with the wide mouth, was portraying the heroine of the film.</p><br/><p>She delivered her lines calmly through her lips. \"Especially when it snows. People always feel lonely, even if they are in a bustling city.\"</p><br/><p>She did not seem moved by Qin Guan\u2019s looks.</p><br/><p>After confirming her identity, Qin Guan sat down across from her to reveal his own.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m Chuck. Who are you?\"</p><br/><p>She didn't reply. She just gave Qin Guan a thin paper bag that contained his next mission. Her indifference made Qin Guan turn serious.</p><br/><p>\"At least give me a nickname so I can call somebody if I\u2019m in danger.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

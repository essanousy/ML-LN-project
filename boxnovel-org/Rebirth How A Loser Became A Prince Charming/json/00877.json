The hidden dark tones of the film indicated his mysterious identity. Plus, Secretary Zhang's behavior betrayed his awkward status inside the government. Thus, he had to personally execute Tang Wei, who had previously saved his life.</p><br/><p>The woman, who loved him with all her heart, died with a smile on her face. The man who cherished her sat on the bed where she used to lay with a sorrowful expression. She had lived in that room. He looked back at the sheets before he left. Her trace was still on them. The wrinkles were still clear.</p><br/><p>There was no real good or evil in the film. Zhang Ailing was not a righteous woman, so she never wrote about high morals. The story was just about the soft love of a woman.</p><br/><p>Ang Lee was more emotional than most directors. This was rare and valuable in the circle, where people were familiar with endings.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had the chance to experience the moving scene with the entire crew. Everyone got on the stage in the style of the Republic of China and sang the ending song composed especially for the film. Ang Lee came over to check the site for the last time.</p><br/><p>The song's exciting lyrics and tune made it perfect for a choir.</p><br/><p>An ending is the freedom of dreams. An ending means the end of the film.</p><br/><p>We are grateful for Ang Lee, who has created another outstanding film.</p><br/><p>Thank you for your guidance and support.</p><br/><p>At the time, the Taiwanese old man was no longer a Chinese director with a good reputation in Hollywood, but a simple man who felt sad.</p><br/><p>Ang Lee got on the stage slowly and glanced at everyone's faces one by one. He was trying his best to memorize them. Maybe when they met again, he would recognize them with joy.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you!\"</p><br/><p>\"No, I should be thanking you!\" Ang Lee murmured, hugging Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was grateful for Ang Lee's support of Chinese actors and the chances he had given him. They were only parting to meet again.</p><br/><p>Later, Qin Guan placed a strange call to Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>\"Wei, I might shift my focus back to America after the Spring Festival. Do you want to return to our villa in Long Island and clean it?\"</p><br/><p>\"I have no spare time. You heard what our lead architect said. A long vacation would be out of the question.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are not an official employee...\"</p><br/><p>\"I can't embarrass my professor. I'm the only graduate from Tsinghua University. Everyone else is from Tianjin University.\"</p><br/><p>Okay. I can understand your pride for your alma mater.</p><br/><p>\"Why do you want to return to America? Do you want to go back to school or the firm on Wall Street?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a sigh and told Cong Nianwei about his worry.</p><br/><p>\"You know me so well. We are childhood sweethearts through and through...\"</p><br/><p>\"Just get to the point!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. I shot a controversial film. Don't worry about it. I didn't reveal any important parts of my body. Plus, it will be edited before it hits theaters in China. The audience may prefer the unedited edition though. The internet is so developed nowadays. Somebody may use their imagination...\"</p><br/><p>\"I can foresee the trouble back at home. I will be criticized by the SARFT, but Tang Wei, who portrays the heroine, may have a harder time. Don't believe any rumors that might surface. We are innocent! I swear on both our mothers! All the erotic scenes were shot with the use of special effects.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his words in one breath. The long silence at the other end of the line made him nervous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

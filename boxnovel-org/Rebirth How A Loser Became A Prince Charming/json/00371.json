I just saw two top magazines come after this model.</p><br/><p> She was very aware of their own competitiveness.</p><br/><p> \"No problem, text me a time and place. I\u2019m finishing my work for the fashion week tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan didn't arrogantly turn down the small magazine. In his opinion, the magazine was pretty good. It just needed time to develop.</p><br/><p> Accurate orientation matched the demands of all fashion brands.</p><br/><p> \"Really?\" The young girl with the freckles looked at Qin Guan with shining eyes. Her features seemed softer under the lamplight.</p><br/><p> \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p> She ran away, looking back at the corner and waving at Qin Guan with effort.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled at her. That moment, it seemed like the ice and snow were melting and flowers were blooming under the starry sky.</p><br/><p> Bang! The girl had hit her forehead against a pole. \"Ouch!\"</p><br/><p> She was an interesting girl.</p><br/><p> Generally speaking, if a person faced some kind of shortcoming, they would always have an extraordinary advantage to balance it out. The young girl was a good example of that.</p><br/><p> Her keen eye for beauty had helped the new magazine find its place in New York in only two years.</p><br/><p> The New York Fashion Week went on, leaving both the audience and the media shocked. Qin Guan entered the Armani headquarters once again. This was the beginning of his dream in New York.</p><br/><p> He had been invited there this time, not gone on his own initiative. Giorgio Armani\u2019s assistant had given him a notice during the fashion week.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan met Chad at the entrance. Chad was fashion sensitive, so he was impressed by the Asian model, who was being compared to him in media articles. Those exaggerating critics considered the greenhand to be on par with him.</p><br/><p> Another passerby here at Armani! Chad put on his sunglasses to disguise himself. This was an inconvenience of being a famous model.</p><br/><p> His agent was not very optimistic. He had considered Qin Guan a threat ever since he had seen him backstage.</p><br/><p> \"Did that Asian model come here for a contract?\" he asked Chad worriedly.</p><br/><p> Chad was impatient with his meaningless concern.</p><br/><p> \"You are thinking too much. Armani is one of the top luxury brands in the world. Those old men would never pick an Asian! Let\u2019s go, we have an appointment with Citizen.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was led to a spare, white-walled studio, where Mr. Armani was sitting silently.</p><br/><p> He didn't say anything. He just smiled at Qin Guan and pointed to the center of the room before gesturing to his assistant.</p><br/><p> The assistant ran up to the white wall and pulled a door open. A tall woman walked in.</p><br/><p> She was wearing a long black dress that floated slowly against the floor. The transparent nail polish on her toes was shining with a cold light.</p><br/><p> Her smooth back was exposed thanks to the V-shaped cut of the dress. She was an elegant blonde who looked gentle, yet proud.</p><br/><p> \"Raquel Zimmermann and Qin Guan. Stand next to each other shoulder to shoulder, please...\"</p><br/><p> The harmony between their heights made them a perfect match.</p><br/><p> \"Good! I think Raquel knows about the requirements of a brand representative. Do you know about them, Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p> Is he just talking about the details with me? How does he know that I will take the job?</p><br/><p> The Italian old man saw his doubt and waved to his assistant again.</p><br/><p> \"I know you are a New Silk Road model. I read your resume and contacted your original agent. I got a reply on the third day of the fashion week.\"</p><br/><p> \"Your agent, Sister Xue, has accepted this job for you. There is a time difference though, so you will probably get her notice this evening.\"</p><br/><p> \"According to the contract, if your interview goes well and you match our taste, the contract will come into effect automatically.\"</p><br/><p> \"So congratulations, Mr. Qin Guan. You are getting a one-year representative contract on a single Armani product. We\u2019ll send you notices at regular intervals. Please arrange your schedule for our optimal cooperation.\"</p><br/><p> \"What will that product be?\" Qin Guan asked in Italian. According to his understanding of Armani, the old man could only speak Italian. He relied on his assistant for all negotiations with English speakers.</p><br/><p> You might be Armani, but I have my own principles. If you are selling condoms, I won't accept the job. I will still be deeply grateful though.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This is all because of your terrible taste. Everyone will point out your mistake.</p><br/><p>Too bad that she was wrong.</p><br/><p>Even though she\u2019d had limited training, the girl was as tough as weed. She anxiously showed all her advantages to the audience, presenting a perfect mix of beauty and camera sense. She was smiling generously, with her mouth wide open, her height and figure making the robe look fierce.</p><br/><p>Her steps were steady, and her attitude on the stage was aggressive. She was from an ancient water town by the Yangtze River, yet she looked like a sandstorm in the desert.</p><br/><p>She strode over to the judges and took a quiet but vigorous pose.</p><br/><p>The audience went crazy.</p><br/><p>The strange taste of foreign people was quite different from theirs. In their imagination, Chinese beauties had narrow, phoenix-like eyes, thick lips and dark skin, and were tall and flat as a board.</p><br/><p>That was a Chinese Aphrodite in their minds.</p><br/><p>When they saw a girl that fit their taste, they were really surprised.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! What did I just see?\"</p><br/><p>\"She was born for the top. Do you know why I\u2019m smiling now? Because those arrogant French will lower their proud heads before this Asian beauty.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sure that the Europeans will spend a lot of money on her...\"</p><br/><p>\"Keep?\"</p><br/><p>\"Definitely!\"</p><br/><p>Their voices got louder and louder with excitement. Lv walked out of the door, trying to cover the tears running down her face.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was as still as a statue. She couldn\u2019t understand those crazy Americans.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan burst into laughter. Patting her shoulder, he whispered, \"You should treat me to dinner. I found a huge treasure for you. She\u2019s both a cleaner and a top model!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue came back to her senses immediately. I\u2019m such a lucky dog!</p><br/><p>She turned around to the principals, expecting to get good news.</p><br/><p>After all, the girls had been selected very carefully. Any large agency would consider them only a drop in the ocean. They could hire them all. It would be easy to reach an agreement on the salary.</p><br/><p>The only exceptions were Du Juan and Lv Yan, who were hired separately by IMG and ELITE. Their contracts were of the highest value. In the next three years, their whole schedules would be arranged by the two agencies. When their contracts expired, the companies would re-evaluate them according to their own needs and development.</p><br/><p>This meant that the two young birds would fly up to a broader sky with a thin Chinese thread fastened to their feet. They would have the chance to choose now.</p><br/><p>The meeting ended in harmony. The models and the agents were talking happily to each other. Before leaving, every principal hugged Qin Guan goodbye.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m so sorry about your decision, Qin Guan. You have been born for fashion. You should dedicate yourself to the God of Beauty.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alas! The world of beauty is filled with disappointment. That\u2019s the meaning of its existence.\"</p><br/><p>Those weirdos were lovely when they talked about art and beauty. Qin Guan could only smile in reply.</p><br/><p>He was still the best among all the surrounding Asian beauties.</p><br/><p>He retired from the meeting room, followed by Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>Somebody sighed behind him. \"I wish I were a firefly lighting up a flame for him...\"</p><br/><p>\"If you were a firefly, there would be no lamp on your bottom...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by the Chinese girls. \"Chinese people can be really great. Those proud Westerners admire him so much!\"</p><br/><p>Soon, Qin Guan became a good example for all Chinese models striving abroad. He acted as the leader of all Asian models.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue believed he could organize an army and set on a small-scale expedition in Europe if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was no commander though. He left Sister Xue with the blog team cruelly and went home to get some sleep.</p><br/><p>Spring nights were always too short. Qin Guan had been working really hard during summer vacation.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was a mighty tiger though. Qin Guan\u2019s promotion reached its peak with her participation as the team discussed the functions of the blog.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

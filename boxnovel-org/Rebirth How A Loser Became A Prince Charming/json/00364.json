He looked like those high school playboys that girls liked. Most girls fell in love with them. They always visited them in their dreams and made them wake up sobbing.</p><br/><p>Guo Nuoyan almost burst into tears. He remembered the girl he loved secretly, who was just as splendid as Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>With a last press of the shutter, their work was done.</p><br/><p>Helen looked at the films. She was in no mood to hand them over to the philistine Asian merchant yet. At the thought of the photoshoot she would arrange though, she felt happy again.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the shooting at Chelsea Fair, the shop owners got a general idea of their clothes. They were all professional designers, who knew all about beauty and fashion. They showed great interest in their casual clothes, which were different from the typical American style.</p><br/><p>After the shooting, customers crowded into the store. In several days, J Clothing had become the uniform of the designers around the venue. Almost everybody had at least one piece of their clothes.</p><br/><p>Thanks to significant aspects such as toughness, endurance, breathability and strong absorbability, they were welcomed as artists. Besides, the most important advantage was their low prices. No one would feel sorry about a stain of paint or wine on their clothes.</p><br/><p>As a result, a small circle was formed. The customers and shop owners influenced each other, and J Clothing became a symbolic uniform of New York designers.</p><br/><p>It was just like black clothes, brass buttons on police uniforms, loose pipe fitter jeans or the white overall protection suits of quarantine inspectors. J Clothing had become the new symbol of New York designers. Without their clothes, a designer would be considered an outsider of the circle.</p><br/><p>It was a surprise for J Clothing.</p><br/><p>Of course, this would happen in the future. Qin Guan was currently explaining his thoughts about the company to his girlfriend. He had to keep investing capital in the developing store.</p><br/><p>Where would that capital come from? New York Fashion Week! That was the top event of the fashion circle in the US. In late October, New York would be full of visitors.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had received a notice from LEE before the CK show, so he was not worried about getting an invitation. Besides, he could meet up with John, who was in Kansas those days.</p><br/><p>Top fashion countries like France, Italy and the UK had their own places in the fashion week, while its casual style attracted countless Asian designers.</p><br/><p>The most susceptible and the first to be affected, were Japanese designers, of course, with South Koreans right on their heels. They had great power in Asia, so they were not to be ignored during the top four fashion weeks.</p><br/><p>The group of Asian designers was led by Yohji Yamamoto, as there was no Chinese designer among them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was surprised by the weak brand awareness of Chinese people, as well as the shortcomings of Chinese designers. However, at the same time, he was happy to see another power related to China.</p><br/><p>It was a special group of foreign designers of Chinese origin. They had graduated from top design colleges from all over the world and studied Chinese culture. This made their place among designers decisive.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan silently memorized their names. I wish they could make their own way in New York Fashion Week this year!</p><br/><p>New York had been lively lately. Even Wall Street elites saw countless foreign beauties when cruising at night.</p><br/><p>The most bustling metropolis in the world was filled with fashion insiders from all directions, adding an exotic atmosphere to the noisy city.</p><br/><p>Unlike the unified management of Beijing Fashion Week, designers there had to find a place for themselves.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not worried about that though. With notices from three top brands, he could be considered a lucky boy in the fashion event.</p><br/><p>The main meeting place was Chelsea Hotel. People were idling around it in hopes of getting an invitation at the last moment.</p><br/><p>On the first day of the fashion week, the Armani autumn and winter collection opened the show, followed by CK's formal apparel. Qin Guan was relieved about the schedule.</p><br/><p>He still cherished a hope about the resumes he had submitted to top luxury brands, but after waiting for a long time, he still hadn\u2019t gotten a call or notice about an interview.</p><br/><p>Only then did he realize the hardships independent models faced in New York. The best opportunities did not always go to good models. Various factors were involved.</p><br/><p>Abandoning hope, he changed into his outfit and waited silently backstage for the Armani models to finish.</p><br/><p>Looking modest during the fashion week was difficult. John, who had to appear long after, presented himself at the entrance leisurely, with Qin Guan's outfits in hand.</p><br/><p>He seemed not to know what the word \"modest\" meant. A group of people were following him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The beautiful landscape alone could provide the media with enough pictures, not even counting the stars on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would be attending the ceremony to satisfy the reporters.</p><br/><p>Thus, he became the protagonist of the entire ceremony. All the reporters gathered around the miraculous Asian man. The local government welcomed the international award-winning actor, as his presence would elevate the influence of the festival.</p><br/><p>The festival was actually only famous in Europe. Besides filmmakers, not that many people in the world knew about it. The local media had already drafted the next day's headlines.</p><br/><p>\"Ten years later, a Chinese actor shows his extraordinary talent and wins the Best Actor Award again!\"</p><br/><p>\"A touching film and a delicate oriental perspective...\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan wins another European award after Cannes and Berlin!\"</p><br/><p>According to their confident predictions, Qin Guan would be the winner. They knew that, just like other European film festivals, this one also favored Asian films. Plus, Qin Guan enjoyed international fame, so it would only be natural for him to win.</p><br/><p>As expected, \"Letter From An Unknown Woman\" was the big winner of the night. Xu won her first international directing award, and the film also won the Best Screenplay and Best Actor Award.</p><br/><p>The Silver Shell was handed out to the entire crew. This was a big honor for the Chinese woman.</p><br/><p>From then on, Xu would focus on her work as a director instead of an actress. It was very seldom that an actress retired from the public eye to engage in hard directing work, but the experience was like a clear stream that had refreshed her.</p><br/><p>Xu had been one of the top four actresses in China, so her retirement from acting affected the structure of the entire film circle.</p><br/><p>After years of work, Fan Pingping and Li Bingbing had finally reached the top of the circle. All flowers bloomed together on the mainland.</p><br/><p>However, Fan was suffering from a lack of popular films. Li Bingbing, who was an older actress, had already acted in some popular films that had impressed the audience. \"The Knot\" had been praised by critics and topped the box office by beating other mainstream films.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fan was just famous for her affairs. She was anxiously seeking for resources with her agent, but it was in vain. All the feedback was negative.</p><br/><p>She had actually been labelled a \"brainless beauty\". Although she had become a beauty standard of the era, she had also suffered because of it.</p><br/><p>She parked outside Qin Guan's office slowly, took off her sunglasses and got out of the car.</p><br/><p>As soon as she went out, she saw a figure and felt a very strong sense of deja vu. A slender woman was opening the door of a black Land Rover. The big car created a strong contrast against the pretty woman, but Fang thought that her imposing manner matched the car well.</p><br/><p>Who is she?</p><br/><p>With a flash of inspiration, Fan recalled her name. She called Qin Guan right away.</p><br/><p>\"Fan Pingping? Are you downstairs?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, how did you know? I just saw Cong Nianwei.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Your memory is really good! Did you know her back in high school?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was really proud of his girlfriend's popularity. Fan suddenly pulled him back to reality.</p><br/><p>\"No, I just recognized her from the photos published by the media. I don't remember any boys from school, let alone any girls. Anyway, I'm at the entrance. Send your assistant down to open the door for me!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

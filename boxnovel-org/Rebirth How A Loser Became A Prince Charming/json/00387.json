Perfect! Pass!\"</p><br/><p> The voice put an end to the shot, as well as the romance.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan opened his eyes and looked at the 17 year-old boy. He looked flushed and lost in tender feelings.</p><br/><p> The Asian boy had attracted his attention without any effort. His expression and body were an undeniable invitation for Alex.</p><br/><p> \"He\u2026 Hello. Do you have any spare time tonight?\" The popular high school boy was asking that for the first time in his life.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was stunned. He pushed the door open and went out, exposing himself to the onlookers.</p><br/><p> \"Wow! Excellent, dude!\"</p><br/><p> Everyone applauded Qin Guan\u2019s figure. American people always appreciated the beauty of the human body.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan turned his head around with the warmest, brightest smile in the world. He put his hand on Alex\u2019s hair and smoothed it down.</p><br/><p> \"Thank you for the invitation, but I am busy tonight...\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan pointed out of the window. A simple Ford was parked out on the yard. Alex saw a comely Asian girl sitting in the passenger seat.</p><br/><p> He grimaced and tried to say something. but it was in vain. His wet blonde hair was pasted on his forehead.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan patted his head gently again, put on his clothes and left.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei was waiting for him, and the driver was undoubtedly Xu Xiaoxiao. They had decided to buy a car after the shooting.</p><br/><p> Most car dealing companies were in the suburbs, where there was enough space for cars of different brands.</p><br/><p> Unlike the single-brand 4S companies in China, in the US every dealer could sell different brands. In the event of an economic depression, they could even sell private second-hand cars.</p><br/><p> In late 2002, there was no online platform for trading second-hand cars. Acquaintances always sold and bought cars from each other. Xu himself was also a greenhand in that field. All his family\u2019s cars had been purchased by his father, but he still wanted to buy a car for himself.</p><br/><p> Lan Jin had recommended a company to Qin Guan, but at the sight of the price list, Qin Guan had rejected his suggestion immediately.</p><br/><p> Prices between 60,000 and 80,000 dollars were reasonable for the Chinese, but unnecessary for New Yorkers.</p><br/><p> In 10 minutes, they had driven to the biggest dealership in the suburbs. Flocks of cars of different colors and shapes were parked outside the company building.</p><br/><p> In the US, the average person had only two choices when purchasing a car: Japanese or American. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were facing the same dilemma.</p><br/><p> The salesman was a short but smart guy, who gave his practised speech before them.</p><br/><p> \"American cars are safer. The steel is thick, and the frame is quite large. The accelerator and brakes are steady...\"</p><br/><p> \"People say that American cars are heavy and suffer from high fuel consumption, but we can deal with that. Ford and Chevy are much better than A.\"</p><br/><p> \"Look at this one. It\u2019s got plenty of space inside. It's very safe and comfortable.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei smiled politely. Actually, they were planning on buying a Ford for their first car, but the details were also important.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan showed his ability of collecting data once again. He was no longer the weak boy in that film, but a confident man.</p><br/><p> \"As far as I know, the Japanese are leading in MGP [1]. Most of their cars can reach 25-30 MGP. This one though...\" He patted the blue Ford, creating an echo.</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s a household car, so it can only reach 18-22 MGP. The international price for raw petroleum went up again. Considering the current economic situation...\"</p><br/><p> The salesman grimaced slightly. That Asian boy is so cunning. He will not buy a Japanese car, but he keeps talking about the advantages of Japanese brands. He is waiting for me to lower the price.</p><br/><p> \"This is my final offer. You can see the labels on all the new cars. Of course, if you are interested in a second-hand car, I have some cars for only 2,000 dollars... No, a 200-dollar gas-filling card is the most I can offer you...\"</p><br/><p> When they were done negotiating, Qin Guan bought the blue Ford with a temporary licence plate.</p><br/><p> In two weeks, the dealership would finish all the necessary procedures, including getting him a formal plate.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei drove off in the blue car, waving farewell at the salesman, whose heart was hurting as if it had been stomped over by a thousand fat horses.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] The distance a car can reach with one gallon of fuel.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

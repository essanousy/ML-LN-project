The historical city was pretty, but typical in style.</p><br/><p>The policemen patrolling the roads were wearing high round hats that looked like the Saint Paul's Cathedral sitting on their heads. This took people back to 1900s. They looked handsome in their black traditional uniforms, the hats fastened loosely around their jaws.</p><br/><p>If this was Chicago, the city would have been filled with criminals, and any idiot wearing such a hat would have been the first to be shot.</p><br/><p>The two sites were quite close to each other. Before Qin Guan could appreciate the policemen\u2019s uniforms, they had arrived at the largest aquarium in the city.</p><br/><p>The aquarium was a part of many free tours, as it was the favorite place of many primary schools. The director had easily gotten permission to shoot a few scenes there.</p><br/><p>There was a strict rule though, that dictated that no random passerby could be filmed by the cameras. According to the relative regulations, one had no right to film someone else without informing them first.</p><br/><p>The cameraman was very careful during the shooting. There were two portable cameras filming the same scene. One was focused on Qin Guan, and the other on the aquarium, which would be used as a background.</p><br/><p>It was dim in the hall, and there were lots of kids running around Qin Guan. An adult was a rare sight there, so it was easy for Qin Guan to spot Julia. The woman was sitting in the hall, lost in her thoughts.</p><br/><p>She was a photographer, so she liked visiting the aquarium to snap pictures of the visitors. Her name was also Anna, and she was a blonde woman with fair skin and a big sexy mouth. Qin Guan mistook Anna for DDW, who was supposed to meet him there. If Jude Law had known that he had unconsciously introduced his lover to an idiot, he would have cursed out loud.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved at the girl, as if they were acquaintances.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Anna. Look at my robe! Nice to meet you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan lifted his arms up to show off his doctor\u2019s robe to the sexy woman. A dolphin in the pool smirked and swam away.</p><br/><p>Both Julia Roberts and director Nichols burst into laughter. The expression on the dolphin\u2019s face was very human-like.</p><br/><p>This was the perfect effect, as well as proof of Qin Guan's unbearable confidence. Even animals couldn\u2019t stand him anymore.</p><br/><p>It was both funny and absurd.</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone paused and laughed. They had to repeat the scene, yet no one complained about the naughty dolphin. Qin Guan was sad, while the other two felt guilty for laughing at him.</p><br/><p>The camera started filming again. The cameraman was unhappy, because the fleet he had been shooting was now swimming desperately towards the other side of the glass pool, as if it were trying to escape from a monster. It was only Qin Guan and Julia sitting there.</p><br/><p>\"What the hell are they doing? There is no shark around!\"</p><br/><p>The administrator looked at them calmly. \"Maybe a typhoon is coming to London. My babies are very clever.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Julia were unaffected by this. The two actors worked perfectly together thanks to their previous experience.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat down next to Julia happily. \"Wow, Anna... I\u2019m so lucky. I thought you\u2019d be an old ugly woman, but you are a true beauty.\"</p><br/><p>Julia looked confused as Qin Guan smiled. He was very confident and aggressive. There was a flame in his eyes that symbolized his power. This woman must become mine!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he said, \"You want to get a room with me? It\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t right now. I have a surgery scheduled at three o\u2019clock.\"</p><br/><p>Julia looked even more confused. She was not sure who he was. \"You are having surgery?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, I perform surgery on others. I told you that I\u2019m a doctor.\"</p><br/><p>A doctor? A doctor who talks to a stranger about getting a room to have sex?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The man standing next to her was smiling at her like silly. Their locked fingers showed their deep feelings, and the subtle expression on their faces revealed their love. Love was an emotion one couldn't disguise or fake.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei leaned against Qin Guan slightly with a faint smile, expressing her emotions for him shyly. The couple was very much in love with each other. Nothing was more precious than that.</p><br/><p>Congratulatory messages flooded Qin Guan's blog from all directions.</p><br/><p>\"Our idol got married!\"</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations from Beijing!\"</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations from Shanghai!\"</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations from... \"</p><br/><p>The happy fans didn't forget to question the gossip online, which ceased immediately. There were still evil people and individuals that liked making their presence known though.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is using his marriage as a shield.\"</p><br/><p>\"So many actors have love affairs these days...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's fans didn't hesitate to talk back.</p><br/><p>\"It must be nice to hide behind your keyboard.\"</p><br/><p>\"Only mean people always think the worst of others.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly. You must be a sleazy person.\"</p><br/><p>When some volunteers tried to tack the user's ID, Chi Hailin turned off his computer with a shiver.</p><br/><p>This seemed to be his final failure. The girl I love got married, and the groom was not me.</p><br/><p>She had married the right person. Chi lowered his head before the harsh reality.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the SARFT had misunderstood Qin Guan's reasons for releasing the news. They thought this was his response to their call. In their opinion, he was setting a really good example for the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>Thus, Qin Guan's name was omitted from the prohibiting order of the SARFT, who shifted its focus to Tang Wei instead.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's actions inspired other stars, who saw that he had become even more popular now. As a result, everyone started revealing their relationships with ordinary girls, young men and assistants. It was like a funny theater play. Everyone took advantage of the situation to show their sincerity.</p><br/><p>In the end, Tang Wei turned from an unknown actress to a popular topic of conversation. As far as Qin Guan knew, she had received offers from at least four international brands. That film had turned a sparrow into a phoenix.</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed and cried. As Ang Lee became popular and shocked the entire continent, Director Jiang Wen suffered a devastating failure. Both the film's box office and reviews were awful.</p><br/><p>There was nothing left to say. Even Qin Guan's erotic scenes outshadowed the other film.</p><br/><p>His film was open and vivid, while the other one was restrained. The audience did not have a hard time choosing between the two. Plus, Jiang's work was quite obscure. Most of the audience walked out of the cinema confused.</p><br/><p>Everyone was interested in seeing Qin Guan's butt though. Everyone also took great delight in talking about it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They were always fickle with their affection. That was why the most crucial task of a film company was to understand the pulse of the market and keep up with the times and the competition.</p><br/><p>Those greenhands currently had a low value, so they were deeply grateful for this chance. They knew that this talent show was nothing but a beginning. Even if they won, they would still have to compete with other young actors.</p><br/><p>Job opportunities were better than money.</p><br/><p>That was why Dragon Television had given a seat to Wang Zhonglei from Huayi. In exchange, Huayi had promised to sign a contract with a couple of actors.</p><br/><p>The boys on the stage were nervous. They tried their best to show Wang their talent in order to join the biggest film company in China.</p><br/><p>The boys were right. Qin Guan and Wang Zhonglei had already ticked some names. They didn't pay any attention to the votes of the viewers at home. All insiders knew that text-message voting was unreliable after all.</p><br/><p>Judging by the program's popularity and the support of the agency, the winner had already been decided internally.</p><br/><p>Jing Boran, who looked like he was Korean, was a cute boy that was popular among the audience. After the talent show, he would be promoted and turned into a steady source of money.</p><br/><p>The boys at the second and third place didn't impress Qin Guan or Wang, but Li Yifeng, who was at the fourth place, was a handsome guy. If he had a small plastic surgery on his face, he would definitely become a prince charming 10 years later.</p><br/><p>Why 10 years? Because Qin Guan had no plans to retire anytime soon. All those boys could do was pray that he would age sooner.</p><br/><p>The next performances entertained Qin Guan. The boss of J Clothing had gone out of control again. He had designed a full outfit for the winner, including a cloak, a shoulder sash, a pair of boots and a helmet. The outfit looked like the costume of an ancient Mongolian general.</p><br/><p>When it was revealed to the audience, Qin Guan almost burst into laughter. He wanted to increase J Clothing's popularity in China.</p><br/><p>Lao Liang was calm as he put on the cloak. \"This is the outfit of our winner! It's a gift sponsored by J Clothing.\"</p><br/><p>If I was one of those three, I would lose the competition to avoid wearing that thing.</p><br/><p>It was a long battle that lasted more than two hours. Suddenly, Qin Guan realized why they had hired him at such a high cost.</p><br/><p>He had suffered a great loss. He was a successful businessman who could earn thousands of dollars per minute. This was a waste of his time. As he watched the other annoyed stars, Qin Guan calmed down.</p><br/><p>The show was finally coming to an end. When they awarded the winner, his job would be finished.</p><br/><p>\"Let's welcome Mr. Qin Guan, our guest judge who will award our winner!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Hey! The audience had to hail the winner, not Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>However, no one objected, including the winner. Jing Boran was still in that ridiculous outfit as he took the award from Qin Guan's hands excitedly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

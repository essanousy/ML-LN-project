Like real fans, the students organized the activity in perfect order. They were reasonably talented, and a long queue was automatically formed.</p><br/><p>A crazy girl pulled her coat open, lifted up her sweater and showed Qin Guan her white fleece, shouting, \"Sign here! Sign here!\"</p><br/><p>Bracing himself, Qin Guan scrawled his name. The crowd fell silent immediately.</p><br/><p>His handwriting looked like the traces of a creeping crab. Qin Guan almost cried. Is it my fault that I don\u2019t have a specific design? I hate my terrible handwriting myself!</p><br/><p>Looking at the first lucky girl who had gotten an autograph, the other girls said, \"Shall we ask for a signature after Qin Guan finishes practising?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that signature does not look good. Nobody would believe us. It looks like it was written by some random person. Even my handwriting is better than that!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Qin Guan, we\u2019ve come to an agreement. We\u2019re your schoolmates, so don\u2019t forget about us when you finish practising your signature!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's all for today. Let's go!\"</p><br/><p>The crowd was dismissed in a moment. Why are you being so practical? Don't tell me that you want to sell my signature! Or are you going to wait for it to increase in value, and meanwhile hoard it as a rare commodity?</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan had a point. They were planning on saving the signature to show off in the future.</p><br/><p>To add insult to injury, Qin Guan was laughed at by his roommates in his dormitory. The sad boy called Cong Nianwei to talk to her about his misery.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei\u2019s curiosity was aroused by the laughter she heard through the phone. She had nearly finished her homework, so she decided to check on Qin Guan at his college and have a romantic candlelit dinner with him. (Actually, the first reason was the most important one.)</p><br/><p>Qin Guan leapt up in excitement. He hung up and asked for leave from Huang Jiajia\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia had spent more than half an hour getting dressed, so she was angry that Qin Guan had cancelled. I\u2019m so bored at home. What's Mou Xiaoliu doing right now?</p><br/><p>...\u2026</p><br/><p>She called Mou and found out that she would go work at Sanlitun. She headed to campus happily to meet her good friend.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was also getting dressed. He looked smug in his white cotton jacket, jeans, high boots and baseball cap.</p><br/><p>When he and his girlfriend walked through the campus entrance hand in hand, they heard someone shout in anger. \"Aha! You didn\u2019t come to my house for our lesson so you could fool around!\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia was angry that Qin Guan had met another girl at college. She considered him kind of a spoony.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei turned around in bewilderment. Huang Jiajia was embarrassed when she saw that the girl was actually Qin Guan\u2019s girlfriend. Qin Guan walked up to her, rolled his sleeves up, and began lecturing her, \"What are you doing here? Why didn\u2019t you stay at home and study? When I\u2019m not there, you idle away!\"</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan stepped forward, Huang Jiajia retreated. Suddenly, there was another roar from behind them, \"What are you doing? How dare you bully that young girl! Don't worry, I\u2019m coming, Huang Jiajia!\"</p><br/><p>\"Bang!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was beaten, a bump forming fast on his head.</p><br/><p>Covering his head, Qin Guan squatted down in pain. Mou Xiaoliu was dumbfounded. Huh? I thought he was a bully, but he\u2019s actually my prince!</p><br/><p>She put the robber bat behind her back unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up, massaging the bump on his forehead as he began lecturing Mou, \"What are you doing here, my sister? What are you wearing? A mini skirt, silk stockings and high boots in winter? Huang Jiajia must be influencing you! How do you two even know each other?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was confused by the scene. There were too many things to see. It was just like a film. Suddenly, a third excited voice was heard from behind them, this one speaking English.</p><br/><p>\"Aha! I finally found you, Qin Guan! You are my angel! There are so many beauties chasing after you, but I still like you!\"</p><br/><p>After they had finished work, John had managed to get Qin Guan's information.</p><br/><p>All he had known was that Qin Guan was a college student. He\u2019d thought it would be hard to find him at college, but he\u2019d unexpectedly spotted Qin Guan at the campus entrance, being chased by three girls. Shall I join in?</p><br/><p>John, the bold and unconstrained American model, had gone there without any disguise. Qin Guan was surprised to see his partner there. He had only cooperated with him once after all. \"Why are you here, John?\" he asked.</p><br/><p>Holding Cong Nianwei's hand, he introduced her to him, \"This is my girlfriend.\" Pointing at the two other girls, who were listening in, he said, \"This is my schoolmate and my student.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no, no! Don\u2019t lie to me, Qin Guan! According to my rich experience in romance, all three girls love you. Maybe a bit, maybe very much, but they all do!\"</p><br/><p>\"Love is the most troublesome thing. You should choose me! We\u2019ll make love to your heart\u2019s content!\"</p><br/><p>When he finished his speech, Qin Guan and the girls were left speechless.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia was the first to break the silence. \"I don\u2019t speak English that well. Could you please translate for me, Mou Xiaoliu?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Qin Guan was astonished.</p><br/><p>Cong Niaiwei explained, \"He said that he wants to f*ck you!\"</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you way too calm considering you\u2019re his girlfriend?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

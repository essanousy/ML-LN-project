While they were drawing straws to get divided into groups, several girls were so nervous that they had tears in their eyes. They were praying to have relatively weak opponents in their group.</p><br/><p>They were divided into different groups backstage. People from the same competition area were gathered together, and people who had a better relationship stood closer. The models from the capital looked strange. Ouyang Fen stared at Qin Guan with wide eyes, while the others were far away, leaving the two of them alone in the middle of an empty space. Contestants from other areas seemed sympathetic about the situation. Better keep a distance from them. The angry guy is outstanding, and Qin Guan is a charming angel.</p><br/><p>When they began to draw straws, they prayed that they would not be in the same group with those two. Let them kill each other. Amen! It's said that China is not influenced by foreign gods. Fine! The Jade Emperor and Buddha then...</p><br/><p>When the organizing committee pasted the list of the groups on the white board backstage, some models were happy and others were worried. Ouyang Fen was glad to see that his number was before Qin Guan's. Excellent! Then he saw that he knew nobody in his group. Okay, I\u2019m safe now.</p><br/><p>A slender model in the same group as Qin Guan stared at the list for a long time. His assistant pulled at his clothes apprehensively and tried to comfort him, \"Don't worry. You just need to pass to the quarter-final. Thirty models will be selected out of 190. You still stand a good chance.\" The model couldn\u2019t do anything but smile at the assistant.</p><br/><p>They had to show their number tags to get the gowns from the organizing committee. All the gowns were provided by a sponsor of the competition, Menglianna Clothing Co. Ltd. It was an exaggeration to call them gowns. The brand was overrated.</p><br/><p>The company engaged in white-collar, urban clothing. At the beginning of the year, a designer had made an ambitious suggestion to the company. The quality of life was getting better and better, and as a result, annual meetings, evening receptions and wine parties were common events for companies. They had to follow the trend to create new ideas. After making several samples, they had collaborated with the organizing committee. They were planning to take advantage of this competition to test their new collection in the fashion circle.</p><br/><p>They had made the gowns with cheaper materials, feeling that this was a casual clothing show, and not an evening gown show. Before anyone could complain about the outfits, the host announced on the stage, \"The first group of female models can present themselves. This includes XXX, XXX... They are wearing the new autumn collection of Menglianna...\"</p><br/><p>The five models walked down the runway, surprising the judges. Is this an evening gown show or not? Aren't those casual dresses? With those dresses on, the individual ability of the models would be more important. Who would be able to make their dress look like a gown?</p><br/><p>The models walked in groups. The eight judges had to give the basic points of their feedback in only two minutes. They were tired and dizzy. When the results of the female group were announced, they took a 15-minute break before the male group came on the stage.</p><br/><p>If their performance was not outstanding, the tired judges would not give them a high score. Sister Xue patted Qin Guan on the back to encourage him. He was ready to go.</p><br/><p>\"Now the 16 male groups will come on the stage. It's Qin Guan from the capital... \"</p><br/><p>Music started playing. Qin Guan was wearing a business suit with light grey stripes and a tie of the same color. Someone with slightly darker skin than Qin Guan would have looked like a rat in that suit. Not a lab mouse, but a sewer rat.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s shining white skin took the suit to a whole new level though. When the other models came on the stage, the assistant of the organizing committee couldn\u2019t bear to look at them. They all looked like grey rats.</p><br/><p>They were wearing grey suits with grey stripes, dots, slanting stripes, and crossings... They looked like a whole family of rats. The judges were shocked, and the whole room had fallen silent. Only the background music could be heard. Everyone was suddenly reminded of the famous animation series \"Black Cat Sergeant\".</p><br/><p>What could one do with such an awful suit? Keep reading and you'll find out. The judges watched them carefully, looking for something different. The contestant on the left side, who was wearing a suit with vertical stripes, was not acting like he was wearing a hospital gown. With further observation, one would notice that the suit was actually of good quality. It hung smoothly and gave off a sense of elegant nobility. Good! The judges then turned to the four models on the right, who looked respectively like a prisoner, a grey Mickey Mouse, and so on...</p><br/><p>Okay, let's focus on the one on the left. The judges looked at his application. He is the one that got a high evaluation in the preliminary contest. It makes sense that he is this talented, considering that he won the capital local competition.</p><br/><p>The judges finished reading Qin Guan's application and wrote down his score before the models returned backstage. Before Qin Guan and the other models in his group could change out of those suits, Ouyang Fen jumped in front of them.</p><br/><p>\"Ha, ha, ha, what are you wearing, Qin Guan? It would be breaking news if a local winner was disqualified in the quarter-final. Ha, ha, ha! How can you compete with me?\" Ouyang Fen was so happy that he lost any desire to laugh at Qin Guan when he saw the so-called gown. Whatever, my enemy is doomed to fail. I will not degrade myself so much as to talk to him.</p><br/><p>The models wearing the same grey suit glowered at Ouyang Fen, who was really talented at irritating others. Qin Guan paid no attention to him though. He just changed into his casual clothes in the fitting room. There would be a swimsuit round later.</p><br/><p>Qin Gan enjoyed his lunch backstage as usual. The swimsuit competition would begin in the afternoon. Ouyang Fen suddenly realized that the swimsuits would compliment Qin Guan, who made a living on both his figure and face. F*ck! I still have to keep an eye on this guy.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen finished his swimsuit show confidently and was planning on mocking Qin Guan again. However, he was left speechless when he saw his enemy in a swimsuit. He stared angrily at him as Qin Guan shined brightly on the stage. He has slender legs and V-line abs! It's unfair! Why would god create such a man?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't help laughing at Ouyang Fen behind the curtain. Are you kidding me? Ouyang Fen has surpassed Liu Xiaoyang and earned himself the annual award of the most childish person I know!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

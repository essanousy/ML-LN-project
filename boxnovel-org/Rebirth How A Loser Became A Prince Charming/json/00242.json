If I knew how often you came here, I\u2019d give you another VIP card.\"</p><br/><p>They all went out of the room. Guan Jian put his arm around Liu's neck and warned him in a low voice, \"Have a sense of propriety! Stay away from Li Jie.\"</p><br/><p>Panting, Liu Xiaoyang answered, \"We\u2019ll have the same tutor next year and we\u2019re still roommates. He might be a playboy, but he has no other bad habits.\"</p><br/><p>Guan grinned and loosened his grip on him. \"I had to advise you. They have no idea about your background, right?\"</p><br/><p>Liu whispered proudly, \"I\u2019m not an idiot. I wouldn't show off about my family to my roommates. Besides, those are my parent\u2019s achievements, not mine. I will show off about my own achievements someday.\"</p><br/><p>Guan was relieved. The little boy has grown up.</p><br/><p>They all went to the fourth floor together. This was the first time Qin Guan went there. He showed the golden card to the receptionist proudly.</p><br/><p>\"You have room 4004, Mr. Qin. Follow me, please.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan told everyone, \"I\u2019ll go have a talk with Brother Bu. Just enjoy yourselves. I\u2019ll come find you later.\"</p><br/><p>Then he handed his wallet to Cong Nianwei. \"Take it. Spend any money you need to.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei glanced at Qin Guan and pushed the wallet away without hesitation. She had gotten a large bonus from the program. This kind of money was nothing for her.</p><br/><p>She gestured at Qin Guan to reassure him and followed his unreliable friends into the room.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan watched her go happily. She spends her own money for me! She\u2019s amazing!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hadn\u2019t noticed the new bed sheets and the groceries in the fridge and the kitchen cabinets. It was Cong Nianwei who had bought them in secret.</p><br/><p>Besides, she also washed his towels and socks.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered Bu Qinglu and Wang Hailiang\u2019s office and saw Zhang Zhenqian sitting on the couch. Surprised, he greeted everyone and took a seat.</p><br/><p>Bu spoke first, \"Qin Guan, you must know Zhang Zhenqian. We are old friends. Of course, I didn\u2019t invite you here to talk about friendship. Zhang wants to share an opportunity with us. You are our partner, so we must discuss this together. This is his proposal. I\u2019d like to hear your advice.\"</p><br/><p>He handed Qin Guan a thick pile of auction invitations.</p><br/><p>On the front page, there were the qualifications, requirements, types of machines and standard models.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan read through the material and got a general idea. Then he returned the documents to Zhang. \"Brother Zhang, how many projects are you after?\"</p><br/><p>\"My company just began doing business. I deal in electric generators, battering rams and road rollers.\"</p><br/><p>\"So why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang coughed awkwardly. \"You know, Qin Guan. This is my first business since I founded the company. I used all my contacts to get this chance. It's my first and final fight.\"</p><br/><p>He looked around him pathetically. \"The company is burning my capital. It\u2019s hard for me to take on three bids.\"</p><br/><p>He had gone there for help. He knew his two old friends were running a club.</p><br/><p>Zhang's words transferred Qin Guan back to his past life. He had met Zhang at a party, but then he had only been a green hand, while Zhang had already had a large company.</p><br/><p>Zhang liked to talk about himself over everything else. He had told the other guests a story about his struggles.</p><br/><p>During his roughest time, he hadn\u2019t gotten a single job in one year.</p><br/><p>He had started to doubt whether he was suitable for the industry or doomed to lose everything. He didn\u2019t want to give up his relations in the industry though. They had cost him a lot of energy and material resources after all.</p><br/><p>Just as his chain in the capital was about to collapse, he had come across a big chance.</p><br/><p>His relations had given him a chance to take a bid. He had borrowed money from all his friends and relatives and gathered all the capital he needed. In the end, he had won the bid and survived.</p><br/><p>The story was much more interesting in this life though. Now he had three bids, which meant that the other two were beyond his means. Every link in the bidding process required an investment, and the government wouldn\u2019t prepay such a large-scale construction project.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

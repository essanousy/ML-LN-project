If people were more considerate and tolerant, they would feel the silent love of their family.</p><br/><p>The bells rang at midnight as the new year greeted everyone.</p><br/><p>The noise of the fireworks slowly came to an end, but people kept a light on overnight. This way, the people returning late at night could find their destination easily.</p><br/><p>At the end of the gala, all the actors got on the stage for the curtain call. It was already about 1:00 a.m. As \"A Memorable Night\", which was a very familiar song for Chinese people, started playing, Qin Guan finished his New Year's Eve with his temporary colleagues.</p><br/><p>A warm call soothed his exhaustion. It was Cong Nianwei, who had returned to Y city instead of him.</p><br/><p>\"Happy Spring Festival!\"</p><br/><p>\"Happy Spring Festival! Are our parents okay? Come back soon. I miss you!\"</p><br/><p>Your smell has faded from the sheets. I can't sleep well without you.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had to stay with her parents though, so she didn't return to the capital until the CCTV drama began. Qin Guan had already started his new job by that time.</p><br/><p>As soon as the Spring Festival was over, he began preparing for \"Crazy Stone\". This was his first investment in a film as both an actor and a producer, so there was a lot that he had to do personally.</p><br/><p>For example, he had to organize a group of photographers and employ experienced prop masters and other professionals. Some of these jobs could be entrusted to an assistant, but others had to be done by Qin Guan himself.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Hao had no outstanding work in China and Qin Guan was a greenhand at being a producer.</p><br/><p>As a result, making progress took a long time. Fortunately, before they could get desperate, something amazing happened.</p><br/><p>The film \"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\", which was in theaters in America, had been nominated by the Golden Globes and the Oscars committee, just as \"Closer\" had one year ago. Both films had famous directors, good actors and lots of fans.</p><br/><p>However, this producer was more ambitious than the one who had invested in \"Closer\". He had broken into the adult world with a children's movie.</p><br/><p>Good news and bad news always came in pairs though. Qin Guan had been nominated for a Golden Globe, but not for an Oscar.</p><br/><p>Things were much worse this time. He hadn't even been short-listed for an Oscar. The movie had only been nominated for its cinematography, music and directing.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not optimistic about winning the Golden Globe either. Using the CCTV party as an excuse, he turned down the invitation of the organizing committee.</p><br/><p>The director and producer didn't attach any importance to the invitation either. They didn't care about promoting the main actor of a children's movie. If the past winner returned with empty hands, it would be a huge embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Thus, neither the crew nor Qin Guan attended the award ceremony. Instead, Qin Guan asked Qu Xuemei to attend it on his behalf.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, Qin Guan happened to win the award.</p><br/><p>When the host announced the result, both Qin Guan's competitors and the members of the crew were shocked.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei got on the stage with Qin Guan's name tag and made an unprecedentedly short speech.</p><br/><p>\"I would like to express Qin Guan's gratitude to all of you on his behalf,\" she said before bowing in front of the audience and leaving.</p><br/><p>Everyone remained stupefied until the end of the ceremony. The reporters were practically beating their own chests.</p><br/><p>The f*cking organizing committee hadn't leaked any information earlier, so they had not been prepared to record the few seconds Qu had spent on the stage. They had let these striking news slip between their fingers.</p><br/><p>The Chinese reporters stationed abroad were caught off guard as well. They had thought that they would only be watching the ceremony. No one had expected Qin Guan to be such a powerful actor.</p><br/><p>These news, as well as CCTV's big drama show, made Qin Guan suddenly very popular.</p><br/><p>\"Emperor Han Wu\" swept the country. The audience ratings took the lead not just at CCTV, but at other provincial stations as well. This prevented the Mango Station from rising rapidly. CCTV had won the race!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and the new TV series completed each other.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

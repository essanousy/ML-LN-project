Only they could enjoy their breakfast like that.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan walked out of the bar with a bag in his arms. To prevent the cream from getting dry, the barista had considerately wrapped the bread with thin tinfoil.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei walked into campus, enjoying the traditional breakfast of another country. They smiled at each other when they parted. Thank you for coming to New York with me.</p><br/><p> With you by my side, I will not miss the moon back home or look for tofu pudding early in the morning. Even this sweet American bread cannot stop our love.</p><br/><p> The couple was the best example of tough Chinese people. If everyone on Earth died, the last humans to survive would definitely be Chinese.</p><br/><p> The two young students were already living a comfortable life in New York.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan entered the classroom quietly before the bell rang. Xu Xiaoxiao, who was sitting in the first row, patted the chair next to him.</p><br/><p> \"Qin Guan, sit here. It's easier to communicate with the professor.\"</p><br/><p> \"Where is your friend? What about him? Won\u2019t he mind if I sit here?\"</p><br/><p> Xu didn't know what to say. Qin Guan noticed a knowing, wicked expression on his face. It must be my imagination.</p><br/><p> \"Never mind him. I think Kuhn will be busy in the following days. Plus, the seats are enough for all of us.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan thought that Xu must have been oppressed by Kuhn for a long time.</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao had been lively in Chinatown, but he had been studying at Columbia for several years. He had to understand Kuhn\u2019s family well.</p><br/><p> \"Okay, I\u2019ll take the seat.\"</p><br/><p> The view was really good from the first row. Qin Guan sat next to Xu happily.</p><br/><p> When the bell rang, Prof. Martin entered the classroom. He frowned slightly when he saw that his favorite student was absent.</p><br/><p> \"Does anyone know why Kuhn is absent?\"</p><br/><p> His voice had hardly faded away, when Kuhn rushed in with messy hair.</p><br/><p> \"Sorry, professor. I had a private affair to attend to...\"</p><br/><p> It was a big event for his family that day. His father\u2019s secretary and assistants hadn't gone home, and his mother, who was only good at acting and shopping, couldn't do anything but dial his father's number again and again and cry in his room.</p><br/><p> Annoyed, Kuhn hadn't finished his homework, let alone the work the professor had given them at midnight.</p><br/><p> Actually, he should have asked for permission to skip the class that morning considering the situation, but he was an ambitious boy, so he had managed to get to the class.</p><br/><p> Anything he did could make the news. He could never leave any room for humiliation from the political opponents of his father. Kuhn immediately noticed that Qin Guan was in his seat. He blinked.</p><br/><p> Xu was surprised by his presence there, but his eyes were shining bravely behind his thick glasses. So what? Things have changed.</p><br/><p> The day before, Xu had returned home and talked about Qin Guan with his father. His terrible father had broken in and said, \"From now on, you should keep a distance from that Kuhn. Stop paying attention to him. Henchmen are only necessary when it\u2019s profitable.\"</p><br/><p> He was right. Although Manhattan was in the lead in the financial circles, they had to pay attention to another important circle: politics.</p><br/><p> Lott, Kuhn\u2019s father and the leader of the majority party in the US Senate, had unexpectedly delivered a speech at Thurmond's 100th birthday party, causing great trouble to himself.</p><br/><p> Lott had made a big effort to praise Thurmond, who was a retiring senator. \"If you had been elected president in 1948, all the current problems of the US would never have existed, including 9/11.\"</p><br/><p> Wow! Did that mean that Lott would say anything to impress people now that he was about to become the leader of the Democratic Party?</p><br/><p> Grinding his teeth, Xu Xiaoxiao smiled. \"Sorry, Kuhn. I didn\u2019t think you were coming. I thought you\u2019d be absent for a few days. After all, who would go to class after such an event? Or is this your true nature? Is it your cold blood driving you or are you actually making an effort?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was stunned by Xu's sharp words. Although he was not good at arguing with others, he was not an idiot.</p><br/><p> Why would Xu fight with Kuhn in such a blatant way? There had to be a story there. I\u2019m a newcomer though, so I\u2019d better remain silent.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan pulled at Xu's T-shirt, pointing to Prof. Martin, who was about to explode at his students.</p><br/><p> You all look down on me! If I was 10 years younger, I would have beaten you to the ground!</p><br/><p> You are funny, Prof. Martin. As an academic geek, you always envied the leader of the school team!</p><br/><p> Kuhn cast a meaningful glance at Xu. Before Prof. Martin could shout at him, he walked to the back of the classroom with his books.</p><br/><p> The class began, diverting everyone\u2019s attention. Xu sighed and pushed up his glasses.</p><br/><p> That year, as a candidate supporting racial segregation, Thurmond had declared, \"Considering all the laws and bayonet of the Washington army, the government shouldn't let negroes into our homeland, schools, churches and entertainment venues!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I asked the staff to lead me to your room. I\u2019m here for you. Help me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat still. \"Who are you? I\u2019m confident about my memory. Forgive me, but I have never met you before. What can I do for you?\"</p><br/><p>The woman finished her wine and placed the cup on the floor. Her skirt was hanging down again.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Qinqin. Don\u2019t be so nervous. This is not funny. You\u2019re wondering who I am?\" She showed her shining ring to him. \"What brand is this?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan glanced at it before replying, \"Cartier.\"</p><br/><p>\"Bingo! Good eyesight! I\u2019m Fang Meiya, the general director of Cartier in Asia. I\u2019m lonely. Could you keep me company tonight?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's eyes widened in astonishment. He had heard every word she\u2019d said, but failed to understand them.</p><br/><p>Before he could come back to his senses, Fang had come closer. Her flying red skirt was like a dangerous poppy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gestured for her to stop and tried to persuade her, \"You must be drunk. This is a tea room. Let me make you a cup of tea to sober you up.\"</p><br/><p>Fang Meiya was lost in the serious expression in his eyes. She smiled again. \"You deserve your status in the modelling circle. Such good taste! Is this foreplay? I\u2019m looking forward to the real pleasure.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wasn\u2019t moved by her words. He picked up a bucket of green tea from the shelf and got down to business.</p><br/><p>Fang Meiya watched the handsome young man with misty eyes. He looked like he had walked out of an ancient scroll. He was making a cup of hot tea for her, a stranger in that metropolis.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she was reminded of another elegant person who used to make her tea when she returned home exhausted.</p><br/><p>Using his slender fingers, Qin Guan held the green cup up and served Fang. \"It\u2019s hot. Be careful!\"</p><br/><p>Fang scanned her prey for the night from head to hoe. Qin Guan smiled calmly. \"I think you got drunk and mistook me for your lover. You remind me of my girlfriend too.\"</p><br/><p>Fang chuckled. She took a sip of tea and said, \"Don't worry, I prefer my man to be willing so we can both experience pleasure. If there\u2019s a man willing to give up a forest for a single tree, no one will force him.\"</p><br/><p>Then she put down her cup and said, \"Will you accept an offer from Cartier Asia?\"</p><br/><p>Without thinking, Qin Guan answered, \"Never!\"</p><br/><p>The invitation was as plain as water to him.</p><br/><p>Fang\u2019s eyes sparkled. She looked at Qin Guan as if he was a newly-released jewel of her brand. Her smile was splendid. \"You make good tea, Qinqin.\"</p><br/><p>She handed him the cup, her eyes twinkling. Qin Guan accepted the cup with a smile, ignoring her fingers scratching his palm.</p><br/><p>Fang sighed regretfully. Then she put on her high heels and blew Qin Guan a kiss. \"Your agent has my business card. Call me if you want.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled bitterly as he watched her walk away.</p><br/><p>What the hell was that? I\u2019d better return to the hall. The party is coming to an end.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't care about the incident. Not long after going out though, Fang found another smiling model waiting for her around the corner.</p><br/><p>\"What about me? Am I qualified to spend a wonderful night with a lustful lady?\"</p><br/><p>Shao was leaning against the wall, looking at Fang with obvious desire.</p><br/><p>Fang stopped pretending to be drunk. She walked up to Shao in a powerful, arrogant manner.</p><br/><p>Their 20-centimeter height difference set off her petite, sweet figure. The dazzling lady was full of ambition. She raised her hand and took Shao\u2019s jaw between her fingers. Shao lowered his head.</p><br/><p>They kissed without love or emotion, filled with authentic desire.</p><br/><p>They parted their lips, both of them out of breath.</p><br/><p>Fang Meiya closed her lips to spread her remaining lipstick evenly. She threw her key to Shao. \"Pick me up after the party is over. The plate number is 6668. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing wiped the red lipstick from his lips with his thumb and smiled charmingly. The key was swaying in his hand. They had a date.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that someone else was dying for what he had rejected. He was leaving the feast with Sister Xue and the others. His mission there was done.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the back seat of the Cherokee, Qin Guan watched Sister Xue smoke before she started the car. They reported their achievements to each other as usual.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know how many advertisements I got? Do you know how many big brands...\" Sister Xue talked non stop. Qin Guan suddenly broke in, \"Sister Xue, did you lead Fang Meiya to my room?\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Who is Fang Meiya?\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop pretending! You don\u2019t know Cartier\u2019s agent in Asia?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even without much acting experience, she gave a perfect interpretation of that graceful beauty.</p><br/><p> Even the prince of Dali, who had seen countless beauties in his life, mistook her for an immortal. Among all domestic actresses, only Liu Yifei had that special temperament.</p><br/><p> As he thought of that, Qin Guan felt proud of himself. Thanks to his acting experience and training courses, he could control his own temperament.</p><br/><p> The shooting went on. The vicious Constellation Immortal had the leader of the four villains possessed by the devil. As a kind-hearted monk, Xuzhu couldn't bear to watch. He maximized his Buddhist nature by cultivating it through Buddhist ancient books and records.</p><br/><p> Of course, he was no Heavenly Guardian or arhat, but the smiling Sakyamuni. It was better for him to have some blooming flowers in his hands.</p><br/><p> He was sincerely worried about the villain, who was about to commit suicide. \"Beware of the devil in your heart. What kind of composition is this? It\u2019s really wicked!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan noticed that the director hadn't stopped shooting, which meant that he could go on without a break.</p><br/><p> Basing his performance on the script, he made his own interpretation. Actually, an actor could perform according to their own feelings. Provided that they didn't stray from the script, no director would judge their performance.</p><br/><p> A limitation was set on the actors only in the two following scenarios. One, if the director had a very clear aim and the actor had to perform according to that, such as when the script was actually written by the director, when the director wanted to win a prize, or if the director was writing about himself and his perennial feelings or wishes.</p><br/><p> The other scenario was when the actor couldn't read the script and the lines were as simple as possible.</p><br/><p> Those kind of directors usually shot indie films, and their train of thought would change all the time.</p><br/><p> Fortunately, Qin Guan\u2019s crew and director were normal.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took a white chess piece and set it on the board at random. He didn't know that, thanks to all sorts of accidental mishaps, he had broken the eternal composition.</p><br/><p> \"You silly monk!\" The villain hit him on his bare head. Qin Guan nodded like a chicken pecking away at rice.</p><br/><p> Before he could explain, he was kicked off. After being sent flying about three meters, he fell on the ground.</p><br/><p> This required the special effect team. Up until that point, Director Zhang had told them to have a break.</p><br/><p> After being beaten the whole day, Qin Guan was sneered at by Huang. Lin Zhiying, who was sitting right beside them, interrupted their conversation.</p><br/><p> Lin, who was from Taiwan, was curious about Qin Guan. He had heard that he was an exclusive actor of Zhang Jizhong. The crew had said that he was the most handsome guy in the world.</p><br/><p> Even some figurants from the Zhejiang Province had confirmed that statement.</p><br/><p> By then, the actor who played Murong Fu had gotten really scared. His role was the most suitable for Qin Guan, who frequently portrayed handsome villains.</p><br/><p> He was relieved when he noticed that only the actor who would play Xuzhu was absent.</p><br/><p> Although the famous actor was not worried about losing his job, he was still curious about that famous guy. He was also renowned for his looks himself.</p><br/><p> He wanted to get some insight into Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> \"Good day today, isn\u2019t it?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled. \"The air is clean on the mountain.\"</p><br/><p> \"Do you like the scenery here?\"</p><br/><p> They were both gentlemen, so they quickly became good friends.</p><br/><p> Huang Bo looked gloomy beside them. Qin Guan always fought with him, both physically and verbally. When he saw the two men being nice to each other, he felt goosebumps on his skin.</p><br/><p> More and more people joined the conversation. Men always liked to talk about women, cars and wine.</p><br/><p> The only girl on set was sitting there alone. She was a reserved lady. I better finish work soon. My mother is waiting for me at the hotel.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, she saw a familiar figure on the steep mountain road. \"Mum?\"</p><br/><p> Her mother had been worried about her daughter, so she had followed the crew.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

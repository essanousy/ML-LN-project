He didn't think she was as pretty anymore. He lifted his little finger. \"That\u2019s you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why? With your looks, you could have any woman you want. A charming mature lady or a Lolita at the first awakening of love. Women would be lining up from Long Island to Wall Street.\"</p><br/><p>\"The industries you engage in are full of beauties, and Wall Street is full of talented women. Those office ladies\u2026 Lying on the desk...\"</p><br/><p>\"Yet you hang yourself from a single tree, turning a blind eye to other girls... Your girlfriend must be a female tiger! There are no faithful lovers these days!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nearly burst into laughter, while Cong Nianwei raised her eyebrows. Before she could teach that funny guy a lesson, a girl ran out of the office.</p><br/><p>\"Darling, what are you doing here? It\u2019s boring inside!\" The Korean girl looked around, her voice suddenly changing.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! Qin Guan! I like you...\" She was about to rush over to him shamelessly.</p><br/><p>Qian felt more confident in his analysis. \"That\u2019s exactly my point! Look at those butterflies! A man like that should lead the same life I do.\"</p><br/><p>It was a pity that his speech was interrupted. Qin Guan wasn\u2019t paying attention to his enlightening remarks. He just walked off with Cong Nianwei. The Korean girl nearly fell down on the ground.</p><br/><p>Qu cast a contemptuous look at him. She slowly turned around on her high heels and disappeared. There were some voices coming from afar.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Do I stop you from seeing other girls?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course not. Those studs and bad boys shouldn\u2019t be mentioned in the same breath as me!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll beat up your admirer in the afternoon.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem. May I help you? I\u2019d be sad if you got hurt.\"</p><br/><p>After lunch, the Korean girl bought another handbag. When he returned to the office, Qian felt the deep resentment of his peers.</p><br/><p>All the glass-wearing men shot hateful looks at him. They were more and more terrible to him during the following process.</p><br/><p>Actually, most of the designers were also constructors. Qian was the one with the most financial strength. Ordinary companies would not take on such a project. Thanks to the influence of Woodbury though, the project would bring extraordinary profits and great fame to the construction company. That was Qian's aim.</p><br/><p>When the bidding conference began though, he realized that money couldn't solve all problems.</p><br/><p>His design director took the blueprint out. Before he could introduce the concept, protests broke out.</p><br/><p>\"Such a plan would increase the cost by 20%!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's necessary to use the latest materials.\"</p><br/><p>\"That conservative concept doesn\u2019t fit the style of Woodbury.\"</p><br/><p> His idea was universally condemned. When Cong Nianwei's team and a famous builder bid together, Qian finally came back to his senses. He was going up against her.</p><br/><p>The Woodbury contractor was quite happy. After that intense competition, the final price was much lower than he had expected.</p><br/><p>Sitting in a chair, Qian was looking at the development in shock. His plan was rejected right from the beginning. He had not qualified for the competition.</p><br/><p>Despite all the gold in his pocket, he could do nothing but surrender this chance to others. He had realized the power of girls. This was a silent counter-attack to his theory about flowers.</p><br/><p>He was doomed. Construction was a professional industry he had no idea about. All the technicians and constructors had connections with the School of Design and Construction.</p><br/><p>Most of them had graduated from Columbia, becoming a terrible force generation after generation.</p><br/><p>How dare an arrogant guy like you bully our schoolmate? Keep dreaming!</p><br/><p>Smiling, Cong Nianwei went out of the office with the relative documents, given to her by the staff of Woodbury. She found Qian squatting by the road.</p><br/><p>\"Sister, I was wrong. Forgive me. I didn't realize your might...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who had gone there to pick up Cong Nianwei, was surprised.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s wrong with him? He had looked so proud at noon.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei looked at Qian and sighed. \"We are both Chinese, so I\u2019ll let it slide. Just this once. Your company will not win the bid after all. Just focus on your company. Be careful when hiring new recruits.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

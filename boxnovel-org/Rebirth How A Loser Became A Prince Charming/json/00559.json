You are the only girl in my life. I hope you and I can be together forever. I want to hold your hands like this every day.\"</p><br/><p>\"You want us to come to the same play every day?\"</p><br/><p>Thanks for the chat, it was very productive...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to Cong Nianwei helplessly. His restraint was gone with the wind as he saw her bright smile.</p><br/><p>That's my girl...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan craned his neck towards her, their faces getting closer and closer. They could feel each other\u2019s eyelashes flatter against their noses.</p><br/><p>Their breaths felt hot on their faces as their hearts beat faster.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei\u2019s lips were pink, and her breath smelled like orchids. Qin Guan closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The big lamps on the ceiling lit up suddenly, making Cong Nianwei shrink back like a scared doe.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\" Qin Guan cried out.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan covered his mouth with tears in his eyes, shaking his head helplessly.</p><br/><p> \"Let me have a look. Why did you cry out?\"</p><br/><p>\"What a shame! I bit my lip...\"</p><br/><p>It really was a shame! He had tried to steal a chicken only to end up losing his rice.</p><br/><p>\"Show me your lips. No one will pay attention to you. Everyone is leaving.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan put his hands down, revealing his bunny-like mouth.</p><br/><p> Ha ha! That mouth would definitely attract attention the following day on campus.</p><br/><p>The next morning was the beginning of the new term.</p><br/><p> Cars were heading to campus from all directions. The entrance was jammed, and the quiet college was now bustling with noise. It felt like the opening day of the stock exchange on Wall Street.</p><br/><p>Cars of unique styles came from different cities, carrying whole families to New York and the famous University of Columbia.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei avoided the groups of freshmen and spotted Xu Xiaoxiao, who was pushing a heavy wagon towards his dormitory building, wearing a green volunteer uniform.</p><br/><p>A family was following him, composed of the grandparents, parents, kids and a tall, thin boy, who had to be the freshman.</p><br/><p>There were several household appliances on the wagon, including a microwave oven, an electric fan and a television. They had moved almost their entire household there.</p><br/><p>It was rare to see three generations of an American family at once.</p><br/><p>They all had bags in their hands. Even the little boy was carrying a small Disney box, trying to contribute to his elder brother\u2019s move.</p><br/><p>\"Shall we help them?\" Cong Nianwei took her backpack from Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Of course! Helping others is one of our virtues!\" Qin Guan walked up to Xu Xiaoxiao, waving his hands at him.</p><br/><p> \"Hey, do you need a hand?\" he asked, grabbing the handle of the wagon.</p><br/><p>Xu turned around in surprise. \"Qin Guan! What are you doing here? I thought you would enrol on the last day.\"</p><br/><p>\"I wanted to suck up to our professor.\"</p><br/><p> They chatted happily as the family behind them talked in confused tones.</p><br/><p>\"I think he is the handsome guy from \u2018Sex and the City\u2019!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's a women\u2019s show. I\u2019ve never watched it. He looks like an indie film actor though. Old Carter and I watched this movie he was in. You know, the one based on Chuck's life... He won an award for his performance!\"</p><br/><p>\"But this boy is a student! He\u2019s not an actor! Am I right, Linda?\"</p><br/><p>The mother of the freshman recognized Qin Guan immediately.</p><br/><p> \"Wow! Our Timmy is right! He is that advertisement actor! He really is a student at Columbia!\"</p><br/><p>\"Honey, come and see! He is the man from the newspaper!\"</p><br/><p> The housewife was blonde. All her kids had inherited her hair color. According to popular stereotypes, blondes had a lower IQ than people with other hair colors.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

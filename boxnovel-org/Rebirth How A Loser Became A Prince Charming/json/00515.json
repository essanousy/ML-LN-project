Cong Nianwei got permission from him to enter the set.</p><br/><p> She was getting close to Qin Guan and Madonna, when suddenly Qin Guan pressed Madonna's head to his shoulder. The monkey turned into a koala tightly attached to a tree. Before Cong Nianwei could explode, Qin Guan craned his neck towards her and kissed her on the lips.</p><br/><p>He was embracing Madonna, but kissing Cong Nianwei. Asian people were really smart.</p><br/><p> \"Wow!\"</p><br/><p>Britney pressed a hand against her chest, completely out of breath. What a meaningful scene! It could be titled as \"betrayal\" or \"choice\".</p><br/><p>The door was shaking in the wind, the light beams going on and off as the young lovers kissed each other sweetly. The woman in the boy's embrace was enjoying the moment.</p><br/><p>Wow! His chest felt really sexy. His shoulders were so broad, and his back was so strong...</p><br/><p>Madonna wasn't aware that she had become the most miserable heroine of the video. Suddenly, a noise woke everyone up. It was Paris Hilton, one of the three women in love with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> The music video had nothing to do with her. Her best friend Britney had actually refused to tell her about Qin Guan's schedule.</p><br/><p>She is afraid of me! Our friendship is really weak...</p><br/><p>She was no stranger to Los Angeles though. She had easily discovered the location from someone else.</p><br/><p>She had rushed to the studio with some entertainment newspapers in her hand, planning to use them as an excuse.</p><br/><p>As soon as she entered the studio though, she came across that exciting scene. I should be the one he kisses!</p><br/><p>Angry, she threw the newspapers and her handbag on the floor. The noise broke the silence. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei\u2019s lips parted reluctantly.</p><br/><p>Madonna looked up from Qin Guan's embrace, turning in Hilton\u2019s direction in confusion. So did Britney, who was actually crying.</p><br/><p>The reporters following Hilton wouldn't let such striking news go. Wow! Everyone involved in the affair is shooting a music video here. Wow! Madonna is hanging from Qin Guan's body. The video was totally worth the wait!</p><br/><p>This would sell like crazy.</p><br/><p>Some of the keener reporters were lucky enough to take some pictures of the kiss. They were all thinking of countless possibilities in their minds.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan told Madonna gently, \"Shall we finish this part?\"</p><br/><p>Please get off my body. </p><br/><p>The media\u2019s presence made Madonna change her attitude at once. She jumped off of Qin Guan, acting like nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>That was an advantage of being fit.</p><br/><p>Finally free, Qin Guan took Cong Nianwei's hands and whispered to her, \"I\u2019m so tired. This is more difficult than sports. Can you give me a massage?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei cast a supercilious look at him as the director waved at everyone. \"Ten-minute break!\"</p><br/><p>What a brave man!</p><br/><p>Nobody saw the mini DV in his hand, which had kept working during the whole process.</p><br/><p>The security guards pushed the reporters outside. Hilton and Britney walked over to Qu Xuemei and Qin Guan, who were sitting by the set.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter?\" Qu looked very annoyed by their presence.</p><br/><p>\"I just wanted to show you this. Please don't sue us. We are all victims here.\"</p><br/><p>Hilton spread the newspapers. There were countless photos and headlines about Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Words and phrases such as \"it is said\", \"it is speculated\", \"mystery\" and \"maybe\" filled the pages. Qu and Cong Nianwei read through the reports in surprise. Suddenly, they realized something.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is famous?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, he is famous for his handsome looks. He\u2019s the most popular type of man all over America.\"</p><br/><p>If these news had been published in China, Qin Guan would have gotten punished for his bad behavior, which would have naturally reflected on his morality.</p><br/><p>In America though, entertainment was different. A man pursued by beauties was popular among film companies. They didn't care about the reason. They just wanted to attract an audience and make money.</p><br/><p>Qu was not worried about Qin Guan now though, like the time when Qin Guan and Li Bingbing had been gossiped about. Chinese people were more tolerant when it came to foreign beauties.</p><br/><p>Only Qin Guan was annoyed by the news, because this meant that his ordinary life was over. He had become a celebrity now. Wherever he went, people would stare at him. This was terrible!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

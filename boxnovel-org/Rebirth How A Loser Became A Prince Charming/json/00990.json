He didn't need to do anything but act as background. It was difficult to row a boat with naked shoulders on the sea surface before sunset.</p><br/><p>The four men were crouching in a small boat. Qin Guan was the labor worker, while Chen Sicheng and Wang Baoqiang were lying on the floor. Duan was also rowing.</p><br/><p>Director Kang pointed the camera at Qin Guan's naked back silently. He finished the scene as if there was no one else present. Then, he waved at the four guys.</p><br/><p>The show was officially over.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not attend the celebrating party. He chose to go home instead. He also turned down all late publicity events and other activities.</p><br/><p>He had to prepare for his own wedding ceremony.</p><br/><p>The rings, which had stayed in the safe for a long time, could finally be revealed to the bride. Crushed diamonds clustered around a 20-carat diamond to form the shape of a heart. The design symbolized the hearts of the couple.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan got down on one knee at the firm before Cong Nianwei, who was still working on a draft, all the staff members were shocked.</p><br/><p>This should have been private, boss. You should have kept it just between you two. What are you doing?</p><br/><p>Actually, this was all Cong Nianwei's fault. She had accepted an offer from the Asian Construction Association to design a foreign vacation resort. The association aimed to promote the construction's location by hiring outstanding Asian designers.</p><br/><p>As a result, Cong Nianwei had neglected the wedding ceremony. When Qin Guan returned home, he found a mess waiting for him. Wedding agencies were making calls like crazy, while the bride was buried under a mountainous pile of architectural drafts.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan realized that if he didn't take action in time, their wedding ceremony would be postponed. Thus, he asked Chen Kang to send over the diamond from Switzerland as soon as possible so he could propose.</p><br/><p>Although they had gotten a wedding registration, there was still a long, complicated process ahead. Back in ancient times, there had been six steps leading up to a feudal marriage. The question \"Will you marry me?\" couldn't fully express that sincerity in modern society.</p><br/><p>The pink diamond looked dazzling in Qin Guan's hand.</p><br/><p>\"Better late than never. Cong Nianwei, I would like to ask you a question with all the courage and sincerity in my heart. Will you marry me?\"</p><br/><p>The staff members around them covered their mouths to hold back their screams. Cong Nianwei looked around at the familiar office and the documents on her desk. Then, she let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\"I will, Qin Guan. I'll stay with you forever, through rich and poor.\"</p><br/><p>\"Great!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan bounced up from the floor and presented her eagerly with the ring.</p><br/><p>\"Let me finish. You don't need to be so nervous. I'm here. I won't run away.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know. So, do you accept my proposal?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, try it on.\"</p><br/><p>The scene didn't satisfy the onlookers. The romantic proposal was ruined by the couple's casual attitude.</p><br/><p>Where were the passionate, loving words? Where were the tears? Where was the moving memory they were supposed to create?</p><br/><p>The reality was as simple as a breeze between the clouds.</p><br/><p>It was an awkward proposal...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

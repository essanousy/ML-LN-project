They need a solid foundation to control the event! They can't keep a whale in a swimming pool! What a mess! An award-winning actor doesn't need their acknowledgement! This is so pointless...\"</p><br/><p>Then he suddenly stopped sneering.</p><br/><p>\"Now I will yield the floor to Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I love you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Cheers!\"</p><br/><p>The lights went on as banners started flying in the air. Qin Guan's fans were roaring, but the other half of the audience was scared.</p><br/><p>\"Look over here! Qin Guan, look over here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh my! I can see him! He is on the stage!\"</p><br/><p> \"We are in the same room!\"</p><br/><p>Some sensitive fans started crying out like mental patients. Paris Hilton handed Qin Guan the microphone. A princess like her had never been treated like this.</p><br/><p>Your turn, popular boy!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the microphone in shock. I thought the hostess would introduce me first. What is she doing?</p><br/><p>Paris Hilton took a few steps back. She wouldn't dare talk during Qin Guan's time on the stage. The fans in the front row were watching her with red eyes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not nervous. He had never experienced anything like this before, but he was good at handling such situations. He just waved at the audience warmly.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, everyone. I'm Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>His voice sounded like a battle horn. His fans began to roar at his order.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>The guys in the LED hats stood up together. Everyone suddenly saw Qin Guan's Chinese name sparkling in the dark. It seemed like they had planned this in advance. It was certainly a big surprise.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's heart softened as he acknowledged their effort.</p><br/><p>\"My friends under the stage, how are you? I really like your gift. What about you?\"</p><br/><p>\"So do we!\"</p><br/><p>Inspired by this grand gesture, Qin Guan's other fans forgot about their grievances. Wow! Fan events should always be like this! This is so cool!</p><br/><p>If Chinese teenagers knew what they were thinking, they would have sneered at them. One was influenced by what they saw and heard since their early childhood. Chinese people were good at organizing formal events with strict regulations.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about this. He just wanted to share his feelings with his fans. Realizing that the crazy audience was now under control, Paris took out the award with trembling hands.</p><br/><p>It was a mini surfboard.</p><br/><p>The award was pocked-sized, but it was a perfect replica of a real surfboard. All its parts were identical, and if one threw it into the sea, it could work like a real one. However, its 182-centimeter length made it too big for a trophy.</p><br/><p>As Paris Hilton carried it over to him, Qin Guan realized he was barely taller than the award.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nearly fell down with his unique prize.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

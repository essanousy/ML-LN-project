As he filled the glasses one by one, the director of the advertising department rushed in, looking wild with joy.</p><br/><p>The program had originally gotten the cold shoulder from other countries, but Mexico and Canada, their friendly neighboring countries, had purchased it. Other foreign clients hadn\u2019t thought much of the program. Only when the audience went crazy about it did they finally notice how unique it was.</p><br/><p>Why was it so attractive? Was it because of the bizarre and diverse modelling circle? The splendor of luxury brands? Its study of human nature? Or maybe the charm of the judges?</p><br/><p>All the above elements made the program successful.</p><br/><p>The phones at the advertising department kept ringing one after another. People from the UK, France, Italy and Germany were eager to buy the rights to the show. All those countries were leading forces in the international fashion circle.</p><br/><p>Japan and South Korea were also in line to buy it, and so were Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p><br/><p>In one day, they had received calls from 150 countries, 20 of them asking to buy the adaptation rights of the whole program.</p><br/><p>The word \"fashion\" was being uttered all over North America.</p><br/><p> Tyra Banks suddenly recalled something and called the people who had participated in the show one by one. Qin Guan's phone was busy.</p><br/><p> His participation had caused some changes to the program. In his past life, the program had demonstrated its power during its third and fourth episode and then started attracting a bigger audience, eventually reaching 8 million viewers.</p><br/><p>By participating, Qin Guan had played an important role during the first episode, thus creating a shortcut for the outstanding program.</p><br/><p>CW appreciated Qin Guan\u2019s contribution. Meanwhile, Qin Guan was sitting in a theater on Broadway, watching the play \"Closer\".</p><br/><p>There was not a big audience in the hall, which made his viewing experience even better.</p><br/><p>As an actor who had participated in an outdoor play, Qin Guan knew all about the difficulties of plays that did not include music.</p><br/><p> During his audition, Director Nichols had insisted that Qin Guan watch the play first. This meant that it had to be worth his attention. That was why Qin Guan had gone to the theater, which Chinese people did very seldom.</p><br/><p> The curtains opened slowly. The background was simple and the costumes were ordinary, but the play was excellent.</p><br/><p>It was a classic Broadway play. After three years on stage, the actors were able to perform very efficiently.</p><br/><p>The conflict at the very beginning attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Daniel, the hero, was an exquisite man of rich emotions. Anna was dull and overbearing. As for Alice, she was sometimes wise and sometimes superficial, but she always seemed mysterious.</p><br/><p>The other characters were minor details for Qin Guan though, who only focused on Lari, the character he would be playing in the film.</p><br/><p>He was a rude man who always sneered at everyone. He was very proud and hard to get along with.</p><br/><p>There was constant conflict between the four characters. The play narrated a complicated love story through different scenes, dialogues and monologues.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei frowned at the performances. That explained why most of the audience members were single or homosexual. This play was not right for lovers.</p><br/><p>It was a lovely depiction of people who had lost the ability to love. It was actually a very sad story.</p><br/><p>The four characters fell in love and betrayed their lovers without fail, showing their hidden bitterness.</p><br/><p>They needed love. Desire couldn't help people understand themselves. There were so many different standards set for love, but love was actually blind.</p><br/><p>A girl who loved money would never know if she truly loved her man or not.</p><br/><p>In an effort to improve the play, the scriptwriter and the director had replaced money with desire in the film.</p><br/><p>They wanted to show that they were men of high taste who expressed their inner thoughts through their work.</p><br/><p>It would be a commercial film with an artistic vibe. Paramount Pictures attached the same importance as Miramax to the film.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who had decided to dedicate himself to art, finally finished watching the play with Cong Nianwei. He was really annoyed. As the curtains fell slowly, he let out a long breath of relief.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

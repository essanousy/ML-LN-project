Make some room for me, or I\u2019ll calculate our share on the original investment. F*ck! You have no idea what that even means!\"</p><br/><p>They were eavesdropping on the drama inside happily. It should have been called \"Beauty and the Beast\".</p><br/><p>Life was dramatic. The right person in one\u2019s heart might not be truly the right one. A real soulmate might have been by one\u2019s side all along.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the one waiting for you in the darkness, during your loneliest time. The one who is always there when you\u2019re tired or covered in dust.</p><br/><p>On his way back, Qin Guan sighed with emotion. Life kept playing jokes on them, and one of them was on him.</p><br/><p>It had only been a few days since the semester had begun, but Qin Guan's roommates were already behind on everything. They were not in the right mood to appreciate the freshman girls. Graduation day was drawing near, leaving them with little time to spare.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei informed Qin Guan about their training class, which was the first step for studying abroad.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to take time off to attend an evening party. Actually, he was rather disgusted by such activities, so he tried his best not to go. Unfortunately, his popularity was much higher than before, and his presence or absence would be noticed.</p><br/><p>That was a drawback of being a rising model.</p><br/><p>If Qin Guan wanted to stay in the circle, there was one kind of party that he had to attend, the public relations parties of his 4A advertising company. That company brought him the most profits anyway.</p><br/><p>It was not one 4A company, but 10 4A companies all over the capital who were holding that party together.</p><br/><p>If a model like Qin Guan dared to turn down the invitation, he would be kicked out of the advertising industry.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put up with Sister Xue's chattering as he changed into his first customized suit in a famous tailor shop in Wangfujing.</p><br/><p>It was a black traditional two-piece European-style suit with a French shirt and a black bowtie. Combined with the right silver Hermes sleeve buttons, he looked like a British nobleman.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan got in his precious Cherokee, Sister Xue smacked her lips in disappointment. Qin Guan\u2019s car did not match his outfit.</p><br/><p>He looked like a gentleman who intended to ride a four-horse European carriage to an extravagant evening ball, but had hijacked a Chicago gang ride instead.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the parking lot of the club, that feeling only increased.</p><br/><p>The parking lot was as bright as day with shining lights. It was time for it to wake up.</p><br/><p>Luxurious Benz and Audi cars parked together were common. Occasionally, there would be a petit Mini Cooper as soft and gentle as its female owner.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue silently parked the Cherokee on the edge of the lot. Its style and taste didn\u2019t match the party well.</p><br/><p>She entered the club according to the instructions on the invitation. Miss Etiquette showed her around, giving her some general information about the private club.</p><br/><p>The club definitely deserved to be the venue of that evening party, as the arrangement and taste there complimented the style of people engaging in the fashion industry.</p><br/><p>There was an elegant, dazzling dance hall and an exquisite self-service buffet. The most intimate element though was the cabinets especially designed for couples.</p><br/><p>Talented businessmen could have red wine and experience the tea ceremony, as well as a private model performance and a relaxing spa. No one could doubt the place\u2019s charm.</p><br/><p>As soon as they entered the hall, Qin Guan and Sister Xue walked up to the director of A.M. It was a sensible move, as this was Qin Guan's clique. As their new exclusive model, he had to register with them first.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue presented her powerful communicative model. Qin Guan just needed to talk about his professional attainments and give them his most charming smile.</p><br/><p>The director of A.M was smiling so hard that his face looked as wrinkled as a chrysanthemum. After all, the companies had similarities in their abilities and clients, which prevented them from being compared to each other.</p><br/><p>They could only show off about their performance and resources. As part of the human resources of A.M, Qin Guan was the best asset they could display.</p><br/><p>Right before Qin Guan had arrived, the director had watched the boss of Long Teng show off to their common clients about his capable model, Shao Xiaobing. Now his best model was there too. Let's compare!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was pushed into the crowd. He and Shao looked at each other silently for a long time. People engaging in the ad industry and brand businessmen were surrounding them, looking as if they were picking Chinese cabbages in the morning market.</p><br/><p>There was no pursuit of beauty in the eyes of businessmen, only value and profit.</p><br/><p>Beijing was no romantic Paris, avant-garde Milan, or competitive New York. The capital was burgeoning, brisk and ready to start a great career. It rushed into the surging international financial world, leaving the original mysterious sense of beauty behind it.</p><br/><p>Cups were raised as light and shadow interweaved. The guests got gradually intoxicated during the charming feast and forgot about their original topics.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed in relief. He was standing by a giant glass wall, looking at the busy streets of the East Third Ring under the cloud-kissed mansion.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a naughty kid ran fast by him. In a trance, Qin Guan recalled a time one year ago, when a concert of cicadas and crickets could still be heard at night in the capital. Now there was only a chorus of trumpets and big crowds.</p><br/><p>People were anxious, seeking quick success and instant rewards.</p><br/><p>This new exploration of fashion, film and TV would be smashed by Hollywood.</p><br/><p>Only the generation of directors in that old warehouse, who stuck by their dreams, would light up a porch light in the dark night.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

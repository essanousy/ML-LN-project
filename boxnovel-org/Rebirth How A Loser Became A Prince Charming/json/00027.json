Squinting at her soft, sweet-smelling little hand, he said tensely, \u201cCong Nianwei, I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei looked down their intertwined hands and answered calmly, \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan continued in a nervous, shaking voice, \u201cSo, will you be my girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei smiled gently. A wicked small voice inside her heart said, \u201cHow could I become his girlfriend when we\u2019ve never even had a fight? Things can\u2019t be this smooth.\u201d</p><br/><p>She opened her mouth and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d At her answer, Qin Guan looked up at her blankly. \u201cWhy?\u201d he repeated dumbly. \u201cWe were childhood sweethearts and friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were just classmates in senior high. We didn't even exchange a word during the first two and a half years,\u201d Cong Nianwei answered calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we were well-acquainted with each other and had mutual friends.\u201d Qin Guan's eyebrows fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you for half a year, and all I know about you is that you\u2019re a silly foodie. You don\u2019t know all that much about me either,\u201d Cong Nianwei said neutrally.</p><br/><p>\u201cI... I am handsome, and studious\u2026 and I make a lot of money,\u201d Qin Guan said incoherently.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei couldn't help but laugh contentedly, \u201cI\u2019m also attractive, and more studious than you. And when it comes to money, who can make predict what the future holds?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to die. What the hell am I even saying? This is so embarrassing! Before he could get disheartened, he heard words of hope come out of Cong Nianwei's mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we need to get to know each other more. We could get along eventually.\u201d Cong Nianwei gripped his hand, which had been holding hers for a while.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pinched himself dumbly before he asked carefully, \u201cGet along eventually?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei nodded, \u201cThat's what I said. We could get along gradually.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Qing Guan threw the plastic bags down to the ground and let her hand go. He ran a few steps forward with his long legs and then turned around.</p><br/><p>He squatted in front of her and gestured to his back while he said, \u201cAre you tired? Get on my back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was amused by his silly actions and covered her mouth with her hand as she laughed. She patted Qin Guan, \u201cOkay. No more window-shopping. Let's take everything and go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saluted in the manner of the Qing Dynasty, \u201cYes, Miss Cong. At your service.\u201d Then he picked up the bags and guided Cong Nianwei to a taxi happily. On the way back, Qin Guan's mouth was wide open. He took Cong Nianwei back to campus with a silly smile on his face, holding her hands reluctantly as they reached her dormitory building.</p><br/><p>Seeing that there were people around, Cong Nianwei stepped hard on Qin Guan\u2019s foot, making him drop his wandering hands. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up the day we return home,\u201d Qin Guan said. Her mouth twitched at his words. She took her bags and ran upstairs.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not feel tired anymore. He saw Cong Nianwei off and then swung the plastic bags in his hands and started humming a terrible song, \u201cOur ordinary people today are happy and okay.\u201d He bounced on the Tsinghua University campus until at last he left.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin happened to be riding by at the time. Qin Guan was really hard to miss.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin saw him from a distance, bouncing around like an idiot. He felt sick at the sight.</p><br/><p>One sentence kept repeating into his mind, \u201cCong Nianwei prefers this idiot to me. Cong Nianwei prefers this idiot to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He rode beside Qin Guan in hatred. He was angry with Qin Guan's actions, which were getting more and more silly by the minute. He couldn\u2019t bear to turn his head and watch him act like an idiot.</p><br/><p>He was too focused on Qin Guan and forgot to watch where he was going when he reached a T-junction. He could only go left or right, straight ahead was a dead end.</p><br/><p>One second Chi Hailin was watching Qin Guan's silly actions, and the next he was crashing into the boscage.</p><br/><p>His bike clanked. One of the wheels flew high into the sky and landed on top of a bush while the other was caught into the earth below.</p><br/><p>His books and papers scattered all around. Chi Hailing himself was wedged between two trees. He had several bloody scratches on his face, and he seemed to be in a difficult position.</p><br/><p>Realizing what had just happened, he suddenly lost his heart. I laughed at him for being an idiot. What am I then? A super idiot?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea what had just happened because of him. He just took a taxi back to his dormitory and began to pack his luggage. He was quite pleased with himself.</p><br/><p>Their room was a mess. They had all got return tickets from the college office and were packing their luggage. All except just one, who was just sitting aside looking downhearted.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang looked hurt. All his roommates would go back home for the Spring Festival. Of course, he also would return home, but he somehow always felt abandoned and alone there.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang was the kind of person who had never had any childhood friends. Nobody wanted to play with a boy like him. Child wonders always made others feel inferior in comparison.</p><br/><p>What's more, Liu Xiaoyang's arrogance and spoiled attitude scared others away. He had been arrogant since a very young age.</p><br/><p>In some sense, his five roommates were his first real friends.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan packed the last tea can into his suitcase, clapped his hands, and stood up. Then he walked to Liu Xiaoyan, messed his hair with his hands and said, \u201cThis time things will be different. The boys in your neighborhood will be different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Confused, Liu Xiaoyang fixed his hair again and asked, \u201cHow is that possible? I know these boys very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan explained nothing. Actions speak louder than words. Liu Xiaoyang would feel the changes once he returned home.</p><br/><p>Everyone put away their luggage and messed up Liu\u2019s hair. The next day, they would return home separately to visit their families.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

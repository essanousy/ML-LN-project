Qin Guan has been invited to the gala!\"</p><br/><p>\"What road will he take in the future? Will he choose being an actor or a CEO?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't want to see Qin Guan turn into a middle-aged man with a bald head and a large stomach. He should remain handsome forever.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! He should focus on the entertainment and fashion circle.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Qin Guan is ours!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's presence at the gala seemed to be a big stimulant for his fans, who weren't worried at all about the Forbes list.</p><br/><p>In America, Qin Guan's fans paid a visit to the nearest Chinatown to watch the gala on TV and have fun with other Chinese fans.</p><br/><p>Some clever American fans even planned on infiltrating Chinese groups to get first-hand information. In Southeastern Asian countries, people rejected the galas of their own countries to watch Qin Guan. Some TV stations even had to transmit the CCTV gala.</p><br/><p>As a result, invitations to the gala became really popular. Younger people were eager to get one so they could see their idols. The stars from Hong Kong and Taiwan also had a large fan club on the Chinese mainland.</p><br/><p>This caused the price of the invitations to skyrocket. Some people sold theirs online for as much as 10,000 yuan!</p><br/><p>\"I need an invitation! I'll pay any price!\"</p><br/><p>\"I just want to enter the hall! Please call 137689797234...\"</p><br/><p>\"I thought you lived in the Guandong Province...\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll stay in the capital overnight!\"</p><br/><p>People gave up the chance to stay with their families for the hope to see their idols in person.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, very few of them could realize their dream. Anyone who had an invitation hid it, as if it was treasure.</p><br/><p>On New Year's Eve, fireworks started exploding as dumplings were being boiled in pots at every home. Soon, all Chinese people began to enjoy a feast.</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly as everyone ate and drank. When it was eight o' clock, the Spring Festival Gala of 2006 opened in a grand way.</p><br/><p>The ceremony did not include any traditional settings or props. Everything was shown on LED screens. This was an initiative of the organizing committee, who wanted the traditional gala to catch up with the pace of the times.</p><br/><p>The content was still traditional though. The audience could guess the sequence of the performaces, which made them a little disappointed.</p><br/><p>\"The first performace always involves singing and dancing. It's so boring!\"</p><br/><p>\"Take it easy. Qin Guan's act is coming up!\"</p><br/><p>People were refreshing the message board online. Most young people were stuck before their computers, as they were way more convenient to use than TV.</p><br/><p>Li Yong and Zhu Jun, who were the two hosts, went off the stage. Qin Guan's fans backstage, including the twins, were shouting, \"Cheers, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got on the stage. When he glanced at the crowd, he calmed down. His initial nervousness dispersed like smoke. The bigger the audience, the more excited he got.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took the lead among the three men. After they sang two sentences each, they would reach the chorus. They had rehearsed too much to make any mistakes.</p><br/><p>The audience was shocked though. What the hell is this?</p><br/><p>The three fashionable men were totally absorbed in the song. There was a solemn expression on their faces as they performed.</p><br/><p>What's that woman doing there? Is she trying to kill one of them?</p><br/><p>The young fans were speechless, but their parents and grandparents were really interested in the performance.</p><br/><p>\"Is this a folk song or a pop song?\"</p><br/><p>\"A pop one, probably. I like it!\" They were really impressed by the performance.</p><br/><p>\"It's so warm and sweet... We are all the same big family. I'm looking forward to Taiwan's return!\"</p><br/><p>The young fans were used to the comments of the previous generation.</p><br/><p>\"The one in the middle is the most handsome...\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Yes! That's my idol, grandma. His name is Qin Guan. Listen...\"</p><br/><p>Older and younger people took advantage of the situation to discuss the same topic. The generation gap narrowed a little this way.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

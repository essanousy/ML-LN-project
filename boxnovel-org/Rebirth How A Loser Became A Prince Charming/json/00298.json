That day was the routine end-of-the-month gala. There were customers whose needs weren\u2019t met, and people from both sides tried their best to attract their attention.</p><br/><p>At the end of the month, they would choose a small hall for their top cowboys to compete. The winner would not just win an award, but also a special bonus. According to the rules, amid the crowd of grabbing guests, the cowboys would yield to the champion of the other side. If, and only if, the champion was absent, one could fill that vacancy.</p><br/><p>That day, Renr was full of confidence. He used to be a top-level cowboy. Because of his boss\u2019 behavior though, he had left that club and opened a small club of his own in a gorgeous building in Roppongi, on which he had invested all his savings.</p><br/><p>By doing that, he had taken most of the customers of the original club with him. As a result, his former boss had sent him a letter to challenge him. After getting fully prepared, he had come to the fighting field with his best man.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s happening? Who is this man? If my former boss had such a man, I\u2019d get defeated. I\u2019d have no chance of taking customers from him.</p><br/><p>\"Can you hear me?\" Qin Guan shouted loudly to the group of dwarfs in annoyment.</p><br/><p>He finally succeeded in attracting their attention.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Meizi, look at that boy! Who is he? I almost fainted!\"</p><br/><p>Two middle-aged ladies with Chanel bags and diamond rings were looking at Qin Guan in a daze.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw his chance to continue. \"I\u2019m only a tourist here, I\u2019m not interested in your affairs. A tourist! Understand? Let me go!\"</p><br/><p>The soldiers from both sides let out a breath of relief. The two guys got out of their way.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, dear sir?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Qin Guan answered with a hostile expression.</p><br/><p>\"Would you be interested in working at our club? We could take care of your visa. We can talk about the details.\"</p><br/><p>Details? Are you kidding? </p><br/><p>\"At our club, middle-class workers can easily earn 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 yen a month. The No.1 earns at least 10,000,000.\"</p><br/><p>What? That\u2019s a really high salary! Qin Guan turned that number into Chinese yuan in an instant. My dream of earning 1,000,000 a month would come true.</p><br/><p>Itching for that fortune, Qin Guan left with Sister Xue, and the order on the street was restored.</p><br/><p>A black cat belted out suddenly from a narrow hutong.</p><br/><p>\"The man left the district. Missy told us to take care of him.\" A strong young man went out of the Hutong with a thin silk handkerchief in his hand. There was a photo of Qin Guan on it. It looked like an arrest warrant from a government office in feudal China.</p><br/><p>He shrank back and told the fat man opposite him, \"I have never seen such a f*cking handsome man. No wonder our lady is paying attention to him!\"</p><br/><p>The fat man remained silent. The strong man murmured, \"We have just taken over a new domain. So many things to do. We were sent to keep an eye on that man though! I wonder if the organization attaches too much importance to us, or if our Missy wants that man... Just look at the photo...\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the fat man stretched out his large hand to grab his neck.</p><br/><p>\"Never insult Missy in front of me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you crazy? Let me go!\" The fat man lifted him slowly, leaving him no chance of resisting.</p><br/><p>\"My bad...\" The strong man squeezed the words out of his throat. When cold air poured into his lungs, he came back to his senses.</p><br/><p>He would really kill me if I didn\u2019t apologize.</p><br/><p>\"Give me!\"</p><br/><p>He put the handkerchief tamely on the man\u2019s hand, the very hand that had almost killed him a moment ago. The fat man didn\u2019t say anything. He just stuffed it in his pocket, and then turned back to walk into the depths of the hutong.</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s crazy... Another guy falling in love with Missy...\" The strong man ran to catch up with him, his long shadow swaying on the ground.</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan and Sister Xue, who had experienced so many strange things that night, had finally calmed down. They just wanted to return to their hotel.</p><br/><p>On the crossing point of three streets, they saw several colorful flags flying in the wind. It was the bar street, the most normal street in Shinjuku.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Sister Xue were eager to escape from there though, as the flags were a symbol of homosexuality. That would be awkward for them. China was the most comprehensive country in the world. There were countless stands selling rainbow paper umbrellas, fans and hats in scenic spots.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

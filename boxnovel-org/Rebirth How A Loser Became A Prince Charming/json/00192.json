Ye Dong, you are a wise man. You will only take an exam for the capital registered permanent residence!</p><br/><p>Ye Dong paused there. \"Yang Jing would rather return home. After four years, she still doesn\u2019t feel like she belongs here. She loves her small hometown.\"</p><br/><p>They all got silent, the atmosphere suddenly becoming heavy. Mu Lejiang and Qin Guan felt lucky about their girlfriends compared to Ye Dong.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s girlfriend would go anywhere with him, and Mu Lejiang\u2019s was his childhood sweetheart. They wouldn't suffer the pain of parting or the melancholy of forgetting each other in the desolated world.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang sniffled. It was too sad. He and Li Jie were close to tears whenever they thought about parting in one year.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was more sensitive towards other people\u2019s emotions after working in film-making. He changed the topic as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, guys. The preliminary matches for the World Cup will begin soon, right? Japan and South Korea are the hosts. We\u2019ll get a ticket without a doubt!\"</p><br/><p>Their attention was diverted from their sorrow. \"Yes, you\u2019re right. The World Cup taking place in Asian countries is the best solution for our team.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's true. We won't have to compete against Japan and South Korea this time, but Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Thailand might be a threat!\"</p><br/><p>Seriously? Is it right to sneer at one\u2019s own team?</p><br/><p>The next morning, the boys entered the examination room with big yawns and black circles under their eyes. They were still thinking about the soccer match.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t return home for the summer holidays. What was the most important thing during the last summer holidays? Being with one\u2019s brothers, of course! Okay, actually, soccer matches, beer and freedom were also important.</p><br/><p>They gathered after the exams and looked at each other knowingly. They knew that most crazy holidays were coming!</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang returned home to check in with his parents. The others picked up their luggage and started for Qin Guan's home.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was the last one to hear the news. When she did, she sneered and hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Blinded by his excitement, Qin Guan ignored her sneering. He was anxiously waiting for the carnival.</p><br/><p>Before that though, he would have to finish filming his last scenes. His roommates, who wanted to stir up trouble, said that they would be his temporary assistants.</p><br/><p>\"It's our first time on set ever! Aren\u2019t you a loyal friend?\"</p><br/><p>\"We can be your assistants or fans! They say fans can visit their idols on set.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was hesitant. \"It's not my fault. The first two shows would have been better for you. This one is a little strange though. It's a show for ladies. There are tens of actresses around. If you add the female extras, there must be about 100 girls working on set. The show itself is inexplicable. They overturn props and pay no attention to audience ratings. I think some fat cat is just spending money on promoting his girlfriend!\"</p><br/><p>His roommates looked even happier. \"We\u2019re even more interested now! Maybe some girl will fall in love with us. We are handsome ourselves after all.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Lei looked at Li Jie with a disdainful expression. He pointed at Qin Guan's face and said, \"Stop dreaming! Try again when you are older.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was annoyed, but he called Sister Xue and got her approval. Then they started for the studio together.</p><br/><p>The girls were shocked when they saw the young men getting out of Qin Guan's car.</p><br/><p>The boys began talking heatedly as soon as they saw the actresses.</p><br/><p>\"Who is the heroine? Are all of them heroines? They\u2019re really ugly!\"</p><br/><p>\"Right! My Ayimina is better than them. I was an idiot to squeeze into that crowded car and drive all this way!\"</p><br/><p>Actually, the young men had very good taste. As prospective social elites, business moguls and government leaders, they preferred Qin Guan's face to those girls\u2019.</p><br/><p>The actresses misunderstood the looks they were giving Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! They are really Qin Guan\u2019s fans. Look at their expressions!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alas! We have to compete with both female and male fans!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue hid herself silently.</p><br/><p>By that time, Huang Bo had come out of the dressing room and spotted Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>They greeted each other, and Qin Guan secretly introduced his roommates to him, which only fueled the actresses\u2019 discussion.</p><br/><p>\"Hang is so intimate with Qin Guan. He even greeted his fans. Do you think...\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! Huang has a girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p>\"That wouldn't influence his love for another man...\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! Qin Guan is so charming...\"</p><br/><p>\"You didn't have a scene him! Right, Wang Xifeng and Pingr? Don't forget the producer of the show. If his girlfriend fell in love with Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>The girls kept chattering. Sister Xue brought several stools for them.</p><br/><p>When Second Master Lian came out of the dressing room, the guys made sounds of admiration. He was the only good-looking character in the show.</p><br/><p>When the setting was finished, Qin Guan's temporary partner, Xiao Hong, arrived.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s you!\" they said at the same time.</p><br/><p>It was an acquaintance. Xiao Hong used to play Zhang Chuchu\u2019s servant in \"Romance Across Time and Space\".</p><br/><p>The girl was quite interesting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

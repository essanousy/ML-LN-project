Qin Guan couldn't figure out what was inside, so he opened the bag and poured its contents onto the table.</p><br/><p>Wow! So many things of different kinds... </p><br/><p>Qin Guan picked up a small booklet first. The word \"certificate\" was printed on its red cover. He opened it and saw that it was a true, if not strange, certificate. A branch of the Ministry of Culture had issued it to Qin Guan as a consolation prize.</p><br/><p>His documentary \"Chinese Stamp\" had rocked the world during the closing ceremony of the Athens Olympics, so the government had sent it to the 22nd International Sports Film Festival to compete over the Fiat Prize.</p><br/><p>Zhang's work defeated competitors from France, Germany and other countries and won the contest. The shooting of the film had been organized by the government, so there had been a lot of people involved. Each person who had contributed had gotten an award.</p><br/><p>A certificate representing their contribution and merit was enough for them. Although Qin Guan was one of those contributors, he had not been invited to the festival.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei took the certificate from her silent boyfriend and smiled as she read it. \"To Qin Guan, who has contributed to the promotion of national sports...\"</p><br/><p>It was written in a formal style.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei got curious about the other contents of the bag. As she had expected, Qin Guan burst into laughter when he read the certificate and pushed it back towards her.</p><br/><p>\"Put it away for me. Another achievement. It's not big, but it was my largest one while you were away.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei opened the blue file. There were two contracts inside. One of them was the Huayi stock rights. Qin Guan had purchased 10% for only 10 million yuan, which was unheard of for an unlisted family business. The price was reasonable, so Wang must have put great pressure on the brothers.</p><br/><p>The second contract was related to the sale of Qin Guan's property in Dongzhimen. An Zhijie had taken care of that on Qin Guan's behalf. After struggling for about six months, Qin Guan and his neighbors had eventually been offered 2.5 times more than the original prices.</p><br/><p>The two contracts were Qin Guan's engagement presents.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei closed the file and put the certificate on top of it. Meanwhile, Qin Guan read the final document carefully. It looked like an invitation. Qin Guan gave it to Cong Nianwei blankly.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei opened it curiously. It was a late invitation to a movie premiere. A piece of paper inside let her know about the status quo.</p><br/><p>It was an invitation to the film \"Closer\". The premiere had been held at a Los Angeles theater, and the production company had applied for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar and Golden Globe Award in 2005. The film had been shortlisted for both awards.</p><br/><p>That explained why Qin Guan had gotten distracted by the invitation. Although these were only supporting actor awards, they were still an Oscar and a Golden Globe! Everyone knew that the Golden Globes were an Oscars rehearsal, so Qin Guan would be excited to win either award.</p><br/><p>Everyone needed an outlet for their emotions. The best way to vent was by working. Filled with emotion, Qin Guan carried Cong Nianwei on his shoulders and rushed downstairs with his car keys, leaving Chen Kang's carefully-drafted contracts flying around the room.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei took the red helmet Qin Guan handed her and watched him put on his black one. Then she pointed down at Qin Guan's bottom. \"Why are we taking this? Where is our car?\"</p><br/><p>Sidecar motorcycles had been the favorite vehicle of the Japanese army, as their balance was better than that of ordinary vehicles.</p><br/><p>As early winter approached, the couple was about to experience the miserable lives people had led 50 years ago.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

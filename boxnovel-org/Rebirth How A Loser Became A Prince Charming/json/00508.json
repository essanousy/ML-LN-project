There was another heated discussion waiting for Qin Guan at the next stop.</p><br/><p> \"MIT pranks are the best! Qin Guan got scared. It was so cute!\"</p><br/><p>Even the local Boston media published the story about the three universities, and so did Connecticut, which was even closer to New York.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the news spreading online, there were girls waiting for Qin Guan\u2019s bus on the way, holding flowers and applauding warmly, offering their spontaneous support in exchange for an autograph.</p><br/><p>The number of posts about Qin Guan on OMG were increasing, spreading around campuses like a rolling snowball.</p><br/><p>The route of the bus was calculated by the netizens. They crossed many states and counties from the East Coast, heading to their last destination in California. The students away from their route followed their bus in their cars.</p><br/><p>Some were waiting for them by the road to greet them and show their support. The bus kept moving, leaving the girls and their admiration behind.</p><br/><p>As they visited the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Duke University, there were more and more cars tailing them. Blonde girls waved flags under the blue sky as they drove at high speed. This was the first trip joined by so many beauties from top universities.</p><br/><p>In Chicago, Illinois, a group of bikers was driving at full speed on the highway, followed by police cruisers. The capable policemen had been waiting for them by the road for three days.</p><br/><p>\"Please slow down at once. Pull to the curb and wait to be checked...\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! Those idiots!\"</p><br/><p>The motorbikes began a game of chasing, when the bikers suddenly saw something strange up ahead.</p><br/><p>Happy country music and laughter could be heard from a distance. Girls with black, brown, red and blonde hair were standing by the roundabout, waving flags and dancing to the music. It looked like a parade.</p><br/><p> The bikers slowed down, trying to figure out what was happening.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! That\u2019s the daughter of the head of a Chicago gang!\"</p><br/><p>\"Where is she?\"</p><br/><p>\"Look! The blonde girl. She is Old Sam\u2019s daughter. It's said that she is studying at Chicago University.\"</p><br/><p>He was right. The Columbia group had just left Chicago University. There were about 100 bored people following them. Their number increased as they passed by states and counties, attracting the drivers\u2019 attention on the way.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! There is a truck up front!\"</p><br/><p>The policemen were drawing near. The bikers had lost the game at the most familiar section of the road.</p><br/><p>The trucks had been attracted by Qin Guan's team. To the drivers, those beautiful girls were the most wonderful view on their long journey, better even than the view along the road.</p><br/><p>By the time the smoke dispersed, the bikers were crying in the police cruisers. </p><br/><p>Qin Guan enjoyed the sea breeze, the beach and the delicious food. After a long journey across both the East and the West coast, they finally reached their destination in California.</p><br/><p>They visited the California Institute of Technology and Stanford University. Qin Guan was already familiar with the holy land of film production that was Los Angeles.</p><br/><p>Sea breeze. Beach. Beautiful women. Deck chairs. Bikinis. Perfect barbecue!</p><br/><p> His friends and fans were holding a party on the beach. Qin Guan was the center of the attention.</p><br/><p>Beautiful girls were wearing the same blue bikini and fake tattoo on their backs, lying on deck chairs under the umbrellas. The tattooed letters on their tan skin expressed their feelings.</p><br/><p>I love you, Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Vivian took a picture of them. When Qin Guan appeared on the beach, the girls jumped up from their chairs screaming. They pinned large, red kapok flowers on their hair and gathered around Qin Guan. They left fast, leaving the flowers on Qin Guan\u2019s head. Qu Xuemei was looking at him with a strange expression in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Well done! Your girlfriend is studying, while you are enjoying the sunshine and the beautiful girls here. I envy your life!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan scratched his head proudly. Then he pulled a long face in reaction to Qu\u2019s words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

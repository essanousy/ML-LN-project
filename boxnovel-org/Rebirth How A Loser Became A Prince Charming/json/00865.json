The group scene would take place on that terrace, so cameras had been placed at its corners.</p><br/><p>At the director's signal, Chow Yun-Fat began performing. He was the king who reigned over the kingdom and all the people in it.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter with you?\"</p><br/><p>Chow shot a disdainful look at Qin Guan. Although Qin Guan was his successor, he was still the worst among the three princes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan unconsciously lowered his head and shoulders. He felt great pressure under the mighty emperor's gaze.</p><br/><p>He muttered his proposal under his breath, \"I want to guard Qinzhou City. Can Your Majesty promise me that, Father?\"</p><br/><p>Ho ho! Guard Qinzhou City? You want to take all my military power out of my hands? Not while I'm still alive!</p><br/><p>Actually, Chow was reading too much into this. Qin Guan was a coward, so that was not his intention at all. He just wanted to escape from his aggressive stepmother. Unfortunately, his father would never allow that.</p><br/><p>When his suggestion was rejected, Qin Guan grimaced awkwardly and went back to his seat silently. His two brothers were not surprised. Their useless eldest brother held no power within the family.</p><br/><p>The short scene implied that there was an ongoing secret war within the royal family. Everyone on the terrace felt sad. The family dinner went on in silence.</p><br/><p>\"Good!\"</p><br/><p>The scene ended with a close-up of Gong Lee drinking medicine. Director Zhang shouted at them from under the terrace.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone take a break except Qin Guan and Li Man! Change costumes quickly. We'll finish all your short scenes today!\"</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was used to such high speed, so he accepted it naturally. The assistant director asked Li Man, who was an 18-year-old girl, \"Are you tired? Do you need a 10-minute break?\"</p><br/><p>The girl shook her head. \"No, thanks. I'm okay.\"</p><br/><p>I'm going to cooperate with Qin Guan! I will be his lover! Nothing can stop me!</p><br/><p>She would be playing the daughter of Ni Dahong, who took care of the empress' drugs every day. Behind closed doors though, she was the prince's lover. They had fallen in love with each other behind the empress' back.</p><br/><p>The girl had started her career as a dancer before she had enrolled at the Central Drama Academy in Beijing. She was only a freshman when she had been selected by Director Zhang to participate in the film. She was really lucky, as this was actually her first job. She would also be meeting her idol there, so she decided to grab this opportunity.</p><br/><p>She got ready as fast as she could and sneaked into Qin Guan's palace. When Qin Guan pushed the door open, she lifted her chest tentatively.</p><br/><p>She gazed at her lover with a fascinated smile, expressing her love and tenderness through her eyes. Qin Guan, who was a playboy, rushed over to her and caught the ribbons around her waist, pulling Li Man into his embrace.</p><br/><p>The whole movement was remarkably smooth. No woman would resist such a romantic gesture.</p><br/><p>Everyone was talking about Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Take a good look at him, Jay. If you learn from him, you could win any woman's heart.\"</p><br/><p>Chou was left speechless by Chow's comments. I'm so annoyed with Jolin Tsai right now. I'll go mad if I hear anything else!</p><br/><p>Before he could say anything, Chow suddenly got excited.</p><br/><p>\"Look! They lay down! Look!\"</p><br/><p>All the girls around them went crazy and started fighting over the best vantage point to watch the erotic scene. There were about 30 to 40 girls gathered at the entrance.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was lying in bed with Li Man in his arms. One of his hands was caressing the girl's soft shoulder, while the other one was on her lips.</p><br/><p>Li opened her mouth gently and caught his finger between her teeth. The maiden's tender lips looked really sexy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Suddenly, he transformed from a soft spring breeze into a sharp sword.</p><br/><p>\"You need long-term training on protocol. As greenhands, you have a lot to learn. Pay attention to my demonstration, I hope you will be able to learn something from it. Remember, try to take full advantage of your abilities. Attention!\"</p><br/><p>The professional model began to walk while Jay played a rhythm for him with his pointer. Everyone fixed their eyes on his perfect figure.</p><br/><p>His legs were neither too tall nor too short, and his steps were neither too fast nor too slow. He was like the clouds and the sky, like an old story tirelessly retold.</p><br/><p>His legs looked slender as his bottom swayed gently. His back and shoulders were straight. As he walked, he cast looks everywhere around him. He seemed to notice everyone and make them feel like the center of his attention.</p><br/><p>The shirt and jeans on his body were common and cheap, yet they seemed to sparkle. Walking along to the rhythm, he got to the front end of the stage. Then he showed every article of clothing on his body by taking the perfect pose. Even his leather shoes looked royal.</p><br/><p>Before the eight girls could come back to their senses, Qin Guan smiled.</p><br/><p>As everyone started fainting, he put his poker face back on. Turning around, he left like he was walking on clouds amid the sound of running water.</p><br/><p>Everyone woke up from their dream and saw the fairy return to Heaven. Loud applause broke out as Qin Guan disappeared backstage. The whole process had been recorded by the cameras. Even the cameraman cheered for Qin Guan. The top model\u2019s performance had shocked them. They would remember it all their lives.</p><br/><p>Jay fell into deep thought though. Qin Guan was too outstanding for the girls. The sharp contrast between them was completely unexpected. Fortunately, this was a show for female models. If Qin Guan had participated in a show for male models...</p><br/><p>As he thought about it, Jay shouted, \"Did everyone see that? Go! Go, you silly greenhands!\"</p><br/><p>The cameras started rolling again as the girls began to practice. The cameraman tried to save the best shots for Qin Guan. Suddenly, the door opened.</p><br/><p>Tyra Banks and Qu Xuemei entered the room leisurely. The former was wearing an enchanting makeup look, and the latter was dressed in black. A camera followed them instantly.</p><br/><p>Everyone turned their heads in their direction. The curious girls did not dare stop. When one of them hesitated. Jay\u2019s pointer hit her on the shoes. She nearly fell down.</p><br/><p>According to the plan, Banks would surprise them. After the first round, the selected girls would get to participate in a formal advertisement as a reward.</p><br/><p>That was a grand prize for the girls. As a cunning woman, Qu had taken advantage of the game rules and tried to combine Qin Guan's work with the show. As the producer, Banks had accepted her suggestion gladly.</p><br/><p>Do you know why?</p><br/><p>Banks had originally only been able to publish the girls\u2019 photos in the inner pages of Stuff Magazine. Qu had provided her with a better choice though: NYLON Magazine.</p><br/><p>It was a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had just agreed to do an advertisement for L'Oreal, who was generously sponsoring the show.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the winners of the first round could sign a 150,000-dollar contract with L\u2019 Oreal, instead of the original 100,000-dollar contract with Maybelline. This was quite a surprise for the production team. The proposal exceeded the previous one on both the value and fame of the brand.</p><br/><p>Besides, this meant that untrained models would be accepted by the fashion circle. The winner of the competition would have an easier path ahead of her in the future.</p><br/><p>Satisfied with the hard-working girls, Tyra Banks began doing her job as the hostess. Qin Guan observed her performance with curiosity. Compared to films and TV series, TV programs, especially entertainment-oriented ones, were very dramatic.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

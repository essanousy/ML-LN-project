Legal issues are beyond my expertise.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know. If NBC was planning on giving up on the show, then I wouldn't be here today. It's a novel, beneficial program, but we don't want to spend any more on it. It's not about money, it's about manners. If all companies behaved like this, no one would ever be able to work in peace. A contract is not a game. We'd never give in to this kind of blackmail. We won't pay them a single extra penny!\"</p><br/><p>\"So?\"</p><br/><p>\"So, we would like to ask you to appear in the last season as a guest judge. The audience ratings will increase greatly, and we will show them that we contribute just as much to the show. Then the producer will have no excuse to ask for more.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you participate in the fourth season, we will remain their first choice and we'll make a reasonable offer.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked. \"I know nothing about the initial contract or the extra money they want to get. Are you aware of my value and the appearance fee I charge?\"</p><br/><p>\"Have you heard of the popular show 'America's Next Top Model'? I only guest starred during its first season for this very reason. I was too expensive for the producer's budget and NBC refused to pay any extra money. Would you hire me despite the cost?\"</p><br/><p>Fu Shen nodded. \"Of course! I am aware of your value.\"</p><br/><p>\"But...\"</p><br/><p>\"We are not worried about money. You will make us a fortune.\"</p><br/><p>That explained why Fu had decided to work for that network.</p><br/><p>There were countless private TV stations in America, all of them living by the law of the jungle. No one dared slack off. Qin Guan's participation would be a big stimulus for NBC.</p><br/><p>\"I plan my schedule at the beginning of each year, so it's already fixed. I can only take a couple of short-term jobs.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know. I have talked with your agent. Our show can be filmed in your spare time. The shooting will only take a few days and it will take place in New York, which is your base.\"</p><br/><p>I have nothing else to add then.</p><br/><p>\"Okay. I'll let you know if anything changes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>As he looked at his old friend, Qin Guan realized that everyone went through a lot of hardships in life...</p><br/><p>He watched Fu Shen leave with mixed feelings.</p><br/><p>The next half of the film was the core of the absurd story and its inner conflict. The costumes and the setting remained the same, but a big number of figurants were supposed to depict famous figures, including Roosevelt, Galileo, Attila and the army of the Roman Empire.</p><br/><p>All Qin Guan had to do was run around the large hall. Some exhibits, such as the dinosaur fossils and the stone statues, would be added during the editing process. That was what their million-dollar budget was going to be spent on.</p><br/><p>Special effects were the key to success.</p><br/><p>Of course, as the protagonist, Qin Guan had his own task to carry out. When the sun rose, it would be his time to shine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

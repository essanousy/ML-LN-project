What about the years you lived without him? The fact that he left without a message? Shouldn\u2019t there be some hatred?\"</p><br/><p>\"Humans are complicated. No single emotion can express their feelings. You were pretty good in the scene, but that emotion was not enough. The audience will only feel warm. That's not enough. You must combine a lot of emotions together.\"</p><br/><p>\"The key lies in the slightest expression. You should make the audience remember you with even a move of your lips.\"</p><br/><p>\"That way, you\u2019ll live up to your Best Actor Award. You don't want the audience to come to the theater and pay only for your face. If you do, I shouldn\u2019t have placed great expectations on you. In that case, there is no need for you to shoot indie films. If you just take care of your face, commercial film directors will welcome you with open arms.\"</p><br/><p>Luchant\u2019s words opened the gate to a mysterious country, where actors didn't rely on the muscles on their faces to act.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smoothed his costume and took a deep bow before the noble directors. Thank you for your trust and support, your guidance and experience, as well as your reminder. Another light tower in my career has been lit up.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his chair, recalling his own father. His father had always been strict with him at home, but he\u2019d always protected him outside. If he had never been in my life, my hatred for him would have been greater than my love.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gestured to the directors to start over. He could feel the true emotions of the character now.</p><br/><p>Luchant was surprised, yet pleased. The young man seemed softer than before. Qin Guan was not acting now. He was the real Jewish boy.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of this, Luchant turned the camera on.</p><br/><p>\"Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>The camera started filming. Qin Guan was sitting in his chair, hopeful and afraid, as if his father had never left him. The noise from the television broke up his reverie, bringing him back to reality and the days he had lived without his father.</p><br/><p>The boy was suddenly depressed. His shaking lips and furrowed eyebrows betrayed his sorrow and grief. His clear eyes were misty, but the tears in them seemed reluctant to fall.</p><br/><p>Everyone remained silent. They were all absorbed in the scene. After two minutes, the director said, \"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone started moving, as if a \"play\" button had been pressed. They were trying to hide their feelings. They didn\u2019t want to cry alongside Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Their tears were like crystals. Floating in the air, covered in dust...</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan stood up and left. Standing by the side of the street with his backpack, he made a call.</p><br/><p>After a while, a familiar voice was heard on the other end of the line.</p><br/><p>\"Hello? Son? It's late at night. What's the matter? Is something wrong? Did you lose money? Get up! Our son is on the phone!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan realized it was late at night in China. His call had woken his parents up.</p><br/><p>\"Son? What happened? America is not a good country indeed! If you are not happy, you can just come home...\"</p><br/><p>No questions asked, just a heart that loved unconditionally.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan started crying again. \"I miss you, dad...\"</p><br/><p>After a long silence, his father\u2019s voice started shaking. \"Why are you being so corny? Hey, he said he misses me, not you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan burst into laughter at his delighted voice. Suddenly, his sorrow faded away.</p><br/><p>\"Goodnight, dad. Wait for me at home...\"</p><br/><p>His father was still laughing on the phone. Qin Guan hang up with a smile. Suddenly, the Batiste brothers appeared behind him.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! What are you doing here? You scared me!\"</p><br/><p>The twins exchanged a glance before the elder one spoke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

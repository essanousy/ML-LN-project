Qin Guan saw his compatriot Fu Sheng lost in thought. By that time, a group of monsters and freaks had come over. There was chaos everywhere. Those monsters looked like they\u2019d broken out of Hell.</p><br/><p>\"We are from the Union of Crazy Monsters. Please come to our party...\" Do monsters approve of your union?</p><br/><p>\"We are from the astrophysics research group...\" So, there\u2019s also \"trick or treat\" in space?</p><br/><p>\"Hi, we are...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s jacket was quite thick, but he suddenly felt like it was being torn.</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoxiao realized that the situation was getting out of control and roared loudly, \"I\u2019m Qin Guan's agent. Come here!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he was surrounded by everyone. Qin Guan finally made his way through the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much, Xu Xiaoxiao! I\u2019ll call you later!\" Qin Guan ran over to Cong Nianwei, who was sitting by the library stairs.</p><br/><p>It was time to enjoy the best holiday in the US with people from all over the country!</p><br/><p>Actually, the Chinese called it \"Wan Sheng Jie\", which literally meant that the night of October 31st was called \"Wang Sheng Night\".</p><br/><p>It was a traditional Western civilization festival that had been considered the beginning of the new year during ancient times. That day, the soul of a deceased person would return to its former residence and try to find a living spirit. Then the two of them would fight fiercely. This was the only hope the dead had of being reborn.</p><br/><p>That was why it was said that every human on Earth shared one common ancestor. This was similar to the Chinese theory of possession.</p><br/><p>Of course, one could consider it as passing through different times and spaces, or just being reborn.</p><br/><p> Living people were afraid of ghosts though, so that day, everyone put out the stove fire and their candles to hide from the ghosts. They also dressed up as monsters to scare the ghosts away.</p><br/><p>During ancient times, people would get together in a church to spend that solemn, horrific day together. By then, it had become a monster parade though.</p><br/><p>American people liked the day\u2019s novelty and egocentrism. They repressed evil thoughts in their ordinary lives, but they let them show that day.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were changing into their costumes in their apartment. After long consideration, Cong Nianwei had decided to dress as a conservative Chinese girl.</p><br/><p>She would never dress up like a bunny, or wear a hairy tail on her bottom. She had found her costume at a general store around the corner. It was cheerful, but not that exaggerated.</p><br/><p>All uniform addicts liked doctor\u2019s overalls and nurse uniforms, but this was not sexy like that.</p><br/><p>There was blood on the robe, which reminded her of Jack The Ripper.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put on his overalls. In the pocket on his chest there was a disgusting echo meter with human brains on it.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's nurse uniform was much better than Qin Guan\u2019s. Ladies\u2019 clothes were always more elegant than men's.</p><br/><p>On her beautiful nurse cap there was a big scarlet cross that looked like it had been written in fresh blood. Her uniform had a Second World War vibe, so her dress also looked wet.</p><br/><p>The most interesting thing was the tripus with the bottle of intravenous drip hanging from it. Cong Nianwei was pushing it happily all over the floor.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, here is your make-up.\" A soft hand wiped Qin Guan's face.</p><br/><p>Several bloody fingerprints appeared on his forehead. Blood drops were running down his cheeks, leaving beautiful traces on his jaw.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Corn syrup. The best filling for cakes.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei put some on her own face. There was a sweet fruity smell in the air. There was still some left on her fingers, so she put them in her mouth to taste the honey.</p><br/><p>Her glittering fair fingers looked like white jade. They matched her pink lips well.</p><br/><p>\"I want some...\" Qin Guan rushed up to her, looking at her face seriously.</p><br/><p>\"Here you are.\" Cong Nianwei handed the small bucket to him, but Qin Guan caught her hand instead. The bucket with the syrup fell to the floor.</p><br/><p>Their fingers were crossed, covered in red syrup. The syrup looked like a river of lust.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put her fingers in his mouth. The thick sweetness of the grapes filled his mouth.</p><br/><p>\"So sweet...\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>Before she could finish, his cool lips were on her face. First on her cheeks, then on the corner of her mouth, and then on her lips. He was tasting the best thing in the world, going neither too fast nor too slow.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei\u2019s eyelashes were trembling slightly. Her rosy cheeks were the traditional carmine color of ancient Chinese girls.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s cool lips parted against her face. \"Hey, Weizi. Open your eyes. It's not the time for sleeping. We\u2019ll be very busy tonight. So many parties are waiting for us...\" What an annoying boyfriend!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Finally, just before she turned 30, Sister Xue's bald boyfriend gave her a bouquet of red roses and a ring.</p><br/><p>The two of them silently started preparing for their wedding ceremony.</p><br/><p>Xue Wanyi had originally planned on postponing the ceremony and going to Los Angeles with Qin Guan, but Qin Guan declined. </p><br/><p>\"You should concentrate on your own affairs, Sister Xue. A wedding is a really important milestone for a woman. This is the only chance you will get to do it right.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'd rather go with you. It's the Oscars and the Golden Globes after all!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm only nominated for a supporting actor award. There are two months left before your wedding. You have to find a dress, choose a location, take wedding pictures, invite all your friends and relatives...\"</p><br/><p>\"That's what you need to do right now. I'll be relying on you again in the future. You can use your experience to help me plan my own wedding.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had a point. Sister Xue was a hot mess those days. Her unkempt hair and loose pants betrayed her anxiety.</p><br/><p>An independent wedding ceremony was beyond her means.</p><br/><p>Wang came just in time with the schedule for their LA trip, including all the press conferences and promotional events. The girl had gotten her agent certificate, so she could take care of everything by herself.</p><br/><p>Thinking of Qu Xuemei back in America, Sister Xue finally nodded heavily at the girl. She would be her successor after all.</p><br/><p>The shy girl spent all her time working and never asked for any credit. She and Qin Guan would be going to the Oscars together.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei wasn't sad about their long separation. She also had a lot of work to do and she couldn't focus on anything else. She was competing against outstanding architects from all over the world over who would design the 2008 Olympics stadium.</p><br/><p>As soon as she had returned to China, she had gotten in touch with her tutor and schoolmates at Tsinghua. The project was really important for the government, so all Chinese people were working hard towards that goal.</p><br/><p>However, Cong NIanwei was not qualified to be the chief architect of any construction project. Although the government would accept bids from all over the world, if she wanted to participate and gain more experience, she would have to join a national organisation.</p><br/><p>She knew the unwritten rules. All national programs relied on a national organization. In this case, it was the Chinese Institute of Architectural Design, the holy place of all Chinese architects, where the most talented students from every Chinese university gathered.</p><br/><p>As a Tsinghua graduate, Cong Nianwei was the youngest member of the team. She would be lucky enough to witness the whole building process of the great stadium.</p><br/><p>The serious architect had no time to pay attention to things like the Oscars or the Golden Globes, even if her boyfriend was a nominee.</p><br/><p>She left Qin Guan at the airport without looking back and he flew to California with Wang Liying.</p><br/><p>The moist, warm wind of South California replaced the dry, chilly wind of the Chinese capital. The green sea, blue sky and beautiful girls on the beach completed the picture.</p><br/><p>There was a silent battle taking place in the city. All the actors, directors, film companies and producers were fighting fiercely. Despite their professionalism and the reserved atmosphere of the Golden Globes, the secret battle kept raging.</p><br/><p>The \"Closer\" production company had spent a lot on promoting the main actors of the film, so Qin Guan had to attend some very important press conferences.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

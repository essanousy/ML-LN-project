He opened and closed his mouth to hold the stem between his lips. The flower was gently inclined against his cheek. His fair skin, sexy chin and the bright flower looked amazing...</p><br/><p>\"Quick! Support me, I\u2019m fainting! Is the sun gone from the sky?\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! He\u2019s a real Apollo! I want his number...\"</p><br/><p>Do your husbands know about this?</p><br/><p>Chad turned back with a confident smile. Suddenly, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had changed into Cupid, casting romantic glances at the girls. The old-fashioned model had turned into a romantic guy, the favorite type of guy of every Manhattan girl. No girl could say no to money and fun.</p><br/><p>A sweet melody played as the cynical prince slowly walked towards them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was walking along the path, in perfect harmony with the music, the fragrance and the gentle breeze. He opened his eyes softly and gave everyone a strange smile. His lips were wide open, his smile warming up the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Chad was surprised by his smile. The man seemed to be saying hello to the whole world, although there was nobody in front of him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his starting point. When he reached the assistant again, he felt the pain in his teeth. That f*cking rose had thorns! My tongue is bleeding! That was the reason behind his final smile. It had been a painful one.</p><br/><p>The blood in his saliva was the cost of showing off. The audience couldn't see what was happening, but Chad knew the truth. He couldn't help but burst into laughter. Ha, ha!</p><br/><p>The photographer was adjusting his camera. The underwear show would be starting soon.</p><br/><p>Soldiers were eager to die, and professional models were eager to take their clothes off.</p><br/><p>They got a piece of CK underwear each. They could do anything they liked with it. What should they do? Take the underwear off? No, no, no. That would be a striptease, not a fashion show. There were other kinds of tricks for an underwear show.</p><br/><p>Female models could wear feathers, jewellery, paillettes or crystal high heels to impress the audience. Male models would usually choose a tie or a pair of leisure fabric shoes to create a sense of comfort or sexual attraction.</p><br/><p>There were not many props available to them though. After searching through the fitting room for a while, Chad gave up on his plan. He decided to take advantage of his sexy figure again instead of diverting attention from it with unnecessary accessories.</p><br/><p>The muscles of occidental people caused a direct visual shock. Chad got on the stage for the final show. Numerous cameras with long lenses were twinkling in the dark. Chad would pause three times along the path so they could take pictures.</p><br/><p>At the first flash, he deliberately shook his chest muscles several times. He was successful.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! I\u2019m dizzy...\" A blond lady seemed to be suffering some blood loss.</p><br/><p>Chad looked back, turned around and smiled. His tight bottom was wrapped in the most comfortable fabric in the world. Its beautiful shape was clear on the camera. Compared to strict ready-to-wear apparel, Chad looked free in the underwear, like a beast breaking out of its cage.</p><br/><p>The CK delegate fell into deep thought. We have to sign a contract with him before he is seized by another underwear brand.</p><br/><p>Chad\u2019s agent felt relaxed as he watched his performance. He was happy to see Chad live up to his reputation. He silently wiped cold sweat from his forehead. The Asian model he had been worried about had outshined Chad though. It was terrible. Chad did not seem to be affected though. He had been born to be a model.</p><br/><p>Sadly, his joy didn\u2019t last long. Qin Guan came out again and surprised the audience. He had found a large piece of knitting yarn in the fitting room. He knew about Chad\u2019s advantage, but he could also expose his own muscles. In Qin Guan's opinion though, it would be really boring to show one\u2019s bottom, chest and legs in that occasion.</p><br/><p>He wanted to teach Americans a lesson about underwear.</p><br/><p>He wrapped himself in the white knitting yarn. In the dark, he looked like a fairy walking on a cloud. The audience wanted to see his true face, but they hesitated at that ethereal feeling.</p><br/><p>If the music had been played by a traditional woodwind orchestra, Qin Guan's performance would have been even better.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

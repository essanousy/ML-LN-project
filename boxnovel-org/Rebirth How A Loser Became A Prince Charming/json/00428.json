According to the request of the organizing committee, Director Zhang would walk on the stars carpet with his actor. Then they would be led to the guest area.</p><br/><p>It was a helpless solution. The guest area was crowded, while the reporters were gathered around the stars area. If they didn\u2019t get any worthwhile material, they would break the fence and hunt down the guests.</p><br/><p>The staff of the organizing committee strolled around the guest area time and again, trying to pull some lazy VIPs to the stars carpet. The VIPs had to go for a walk and then get permission to return.</p><br/><p>If the stars in China knew about this situation, they would have been jealous. I should be walking on the red carpet! Not you!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Director Zhang stood on the edge of the carpet, waiting for the people in front of them to walk a little farther away. Several second and third level American celebrities were waiting behind the ropes. They would get the chance to walk on the carpet after all the stars on the list had finished their presentation.</p><br/><p>Haute Couture was showing its real power. Affected by the war in Iraq, most stars had chosen to wear black, grey and white outfits to the ceremony. It was the details that were the most important.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked like Triton among minnows. Most people around him were members of the entertainment and fashion circle. The envious expression in their eyes was clear. They talked to each other secretly, speculating about Qin Guan's identity.</p><br/><p>Then a helpless voice was heard.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay! I\u2019ll go! You are capable enough to catch me!\" It was Catherine Zeta-Jones, who was complaining to the staff as she arranged her long dress. The beautiful woman was one of the most likely actors to win an Oscar. She shrugged as she stood behind Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Are you Chinese?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt someone poking him in the back.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" He looked back and gave her a friendly smile.</p><br/><p>\"Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are out.\" Zeta-Jones was straightforward. \"The award committee was informed five days ago. Besides, I didn't see your movie at the publicity conference a few months ago.\"</p><br/><p>The woman was really rude. Qin Guan cast a glance at Director Zhang, but saw him look calm at the news.</p><br/><p>Both \"Chicago\" and \"Gangs of New York\" were powerful competitors for the Oscar. The two films had been produced by Miramax Films. Miramax hadn't invested as much in \"Heroes\" though, because it was a foreign film.</p><br/><p>At the indication of an assistant, Qin Guan and Zhang Yimou stepped on the carpet.</p><br/><p>The host made an introduction, \"The nominee for Best Foreign Film... \u2018Heroes\u2019 from China... Director Zhang Yimou and actor Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Qin Guan got the chance to hear his full name. He was grateful for the honor.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue nearly cried her eyes out as she watched Qin Guan set a foot on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked his absolute best. He was a completely different guy during working hours. Some people said that Zhang Yimou was the only Chinese director who looked handsome in a western style suit. If they saw the red carpet Oscar show though, they would admit that Qin Guan was the most handsome Chinese man in a western style suit.</p><br/><p>Among all the foreign reporters stood a lonely figure. He had been sent by the Xinlang website and had gone to the ceremony by paying for his own expenses. As the only Chinese media representative there, he focused on \"Heroes\".</p><br/><p>Because of his limited budget, he could only take some photos. He had no video camera. His only chance to take pictures was when they were on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>\"Director Zhang is coming! Get ready!\"</p><br/><p>Unlike the excited Chinese reporter, the other foreign reporters put down their heavy cameras to take a break after taking pictures of the Dutch star before Qin Guan and Director Zhang. The competitors for Best Foreign Film were not as important to them.</p><br/><p>When they saw the two Asian men though, they hastened to lift their cameras up again.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s outfit looked as fitting and natural as his own skin. Everyone took in his perfect figure. Inlaid, handcrafted embroidery was blossoming on his chest. As he moved, it reflected silver light like pure sand on a beach.</p><br/><p>Even the outfit couldn't surpass the elegance of the Asian actor himself though. As he walked through the media area, he leaned naturally to the right.</p><br/><p>He waved his right hand at the crowd. On the camera, he looked like an angel fallen from Heaven. His smile was like the blazing sun, casting light at everyone around him.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Director Zhang and Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Finally, the Chinese reporter caught sight of the only Chinese faces on the red carpet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They would know everything soon enough in class.</p><br/><p>After passing several buildings, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei finally reached their favorite place: the library. The building was of a solemn, ancient style, unlike the rest of New York, which was very fancy. Human knowledge was stored there.</p><br/><p>The library of the University of Columbia had the fifth largest collection of books in America. There were thousands of ancient books there. The floor and the chairs were made of brown wood, and there were also private, independent chambers. Students there had many choices.</p><br/><p>Their class was a vocation course, yet half the seats were already taken. They made a quick visit to the library and then left.</p><br/><p>\"The library is open 23 hours a day. The staff arranges the returned books during that one hour. You can study here anytime.\"</p><br/><p>\"The bad news is, although the library can hold hundreds of students, it\u2019s usually impossible to find a spare seat on weekdays.\"</p><br/><p>\"This university is very academic. You\u2019ll see when you get to your first class.\"</p><br/><p>Words couldn\u2019t do justice to the reality of the situation. Most Chinese students, who were the most diligent guys in Asia, would not listen to the seniors\u2019 stories. As a result, they would cry later in class.</p><br/><p> At the end of their tour, they saw a strange iron gate.</p><br/><p>It was black with European characteristics, so it stood out in the university. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei looked at John curiously, waiting for his explanation.</p><br/><p>John shrugged helplessly. \"It\u2019s Barnard College.\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s an independent girls-only college inside our university. The girls can apply for a degree from Columbia University after their graduation. We do not recognize their diplomas though. All their professors and staff are independent from our university. We call their college a younger sister. If you are not clever enough, you could apply to this college.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he looked up proudly. I\u2019m a proud student of Columbia University!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw some freshmen going out. They were wearing purple summer uniforms with a bear symbol on them. Interesting. It was different from the lion of Columbia University.</p><br/><p>It was just like a small college in Peking University. The students shared all the resources on campus, including the library and the gym.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, John told Qin Guan in secret, \"The girls there all engage in art. They are the most beautiful girls in the US, and they like to date students from our university. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>I understand nothing. My girlfriend is here, and I don't want to die.</p><br/><p>They walked out of the gate with their shoulders touching, fighting playfully. Outside was Broadway Street.</p><br/><p>The setting sun cast an orange light on the street, which was quiet during peak time.</p><br/><p> They unconsciously headed west. Unlike most universities in the US, Columbia University had fences. That was because there was a river by the side gate.</p><br/><p>Purple flowers decorated the bank. On the other side of the river was the noisy urban area.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for showing us around. See you in class!\"</p><br/><p>They said goodbye on the path along the river. This was the splendid paradise they would be striving in in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei decided to walk along the river towards Broadway Street before concluding their trip.</p><br/><p>There were simple restaurants all along the street. Cheap fast food, like hamburgers and fries, was popular among the students. Breakfast there cost only 1.99 dollars.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The next morning was just as beautiful. Taking their student cards with them, they walked in different directions, starting off the new semester.</p><br/><p>Following his timetable, Qin Guan went to his first classroom. He saw a Chinese cup, a clean handkerchief and a vintage cigar case on the professor\u2019s desk.</p><br/><p>What kind of person is our professor? He sure has a strange style!</p><br/><p>When most students had taken their seats, Professor Martin entered the classroom leisurely. Those things on the desk must have been arranged by Kuhn. Martin cast a favorable glance at the first row, where a young man with blonde hair and blue eyes was sitting. He was grinning at Martin.</p><br/><p>Martin sighed at him helplessly. Then he saw a boy with thick glasses. Xu Xiaoxiao, Kuhn\u2019s friend, also passed the postgraduate exams. Good boy!</p><br/><p>Where is my Chinese boy? Is he late for his first class?</p><br/><p>Martin couldn\u2019t find Qin Guan. Forget it. I\u2019ll call names first.</p><br/><p>\"Kuhn?\"</p><br/><p>\"Here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Here!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The two of them seemed to be suffering amid the beautiful landscape.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked with difficulty down the trembling bamboo bridge as butterflies and singing birds flew around him. The scene was dark, yet also funny.</p><br/><p>At the end of the scene, Qin Guan was faced with a great difficulty.</p><br/><p>I'm fine with swimming in the clean river, but why do I have to pee? Although only his naked back would be visible, Qin Guan still felt terrible.</p><br/><p>\"You will be making a sacrifice for art!\"</p><br/><p>\"No! This is not art!\"</p><br/><p>\"This is an outlet for a simple young man living in nature!\"</p><br/><p>\"Peeing is an outlet?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll give you three kilos of Hani veal for your wife!\"</p><br/><p>\"10!\"</p><br/><p>\"Deal!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sold himself out for food.</p><br/><p>Jiang cleared away all the idlers, leaving only the cameraman on set.</p><br/><p>The clear, cool river was waiting for Qin Guan's esteemed presence amid the sunny day.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt and a pair of black pants. He leaned in and fell into the river. His wet clothes stuck to his body, drawing the outline of his muscles.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan started backstroking in the river, creating a beautiful picture of a young man in nature.</p><br/><p>Then he returned to the bank and took off all his clothes. Every inch of his skin was crying for warmth under the sunshine.</p><br/><p>\"Quick! Do it!\" Jiang and the cameraman were looking at him eagerly.</p><br/><p>It had taken him too long to take off his clothes. Let's get straight to the point!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was under great pressure. Everyone knew that it was impossible to carry out even an everyday task when one had four eager eyes fixed on their back.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a real genius though. He was a professional actor, so he eventually managed to force some urine out.</p><br/><p>Director Jiang was really satisfied with the result.</p><br/><p>One should never try to discuss the meaning of a scene with an indie film director. Was this scene meaningless nonsense? Or was Jiang just sacrificing Qin Guan for the box office? Qin Guan had no idea.</p><br/><p>Some crazy fans would go to the cinema just to watch that though.</p><br/><p>The short story ended when Qin Guan's mother saw reason. While she had been pregnant, her husband had cheated on her and fallen in love with a Russian woman in the army. Thus, he had died in shame instead of dying a martyr. Zhou Yun had returned to his hometown with his ashes and raised his child.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she came back to her senses, got rid of her love for her husband and son, and threw herself into the river.</p><br/><p>A pair of red embroidered shoes floated in the river as the old Russian song \"Katyusha\" played. Its hidden meaning was really profound.</p><br/><p>If it wasn't for Jiang's explanation, Zhou Yun and Qin Guan would never have understood its subtle connotation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

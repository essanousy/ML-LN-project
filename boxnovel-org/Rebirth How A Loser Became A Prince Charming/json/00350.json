Yamaguchi Tsutomu\u2019s trip to New York was a test.</p><br/><p> In the US, the domains of different gangs were intertwined with each other. Nearly all top 10 gangs had a branch in New York.</p><br/><p> There were not just Chinese gangs in Chinatown. Russians had also come to the harbor with tankers, and the Scottish, who engaged in construction, were just as difficult to deal with.</p><br/><p> The fate of a Japanese gang without any foundation that wanted a share of the cake would depend on the local gangs\u2019 decision. A powerful dragon could not crush a snake after all.</p><br/><p> Yamaguchi Tsutomu was not a reasonable girl though.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m sorry, Ms. Yamaguchi. I have no idea why you visited us. The Xu Family is only a branch. We have been far from the center of power for a long time. Besides, we do not engage in the business you are proposing.\"</p><br/><p> \"To be frank, Chinatown is not what it used to be like 10 years ago. That business disappeared during the general repression five years ago.\"</p><br/><p> \"We are all honest businessmen. We have no idea about the business you deal in. Maybe you can find someone else.\"</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao was no longer the retinue following Qin Guan around. Sitting by a round table of dalbergia odorifera calmly, he shook his head, blowing at the non-existent tea leaves in his cup.</p><br/><p> Yamaguchi Tsutomu sat across the table with a poker face. Wild rivers and seas were occupying her mind. This was her first stop in New York. They are showing no interest in our high profits!</p><br/><p> Actually, she had found the wrong person. The Xu Family had been whitewashed up to the third generation. Their successors were all engaging in business and politics.</p><br/><p> The Chinese race was the keenest on politics. They had realized pretty early that the US government would not tolerate the expansion of gangs, so they had gone ashore as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p> You are a greenhand with no idea about the situation. You dare come bother law-abiding citizens like us! We are kind enough not to report you to the New York police!</p><br/><p> Yamaguchi Tsutomu felt defeated by the stubborn boy. Without saying anything else, she patted the table and stood up.</p><br/><p> \"Okay, we are leaving. Let\u2019s not delay each other anymore. Time is precious after all.\"</p><br/><p> \"That's it!\" Shocked, Xu nearly dropped his cover.</p><br/><p> The representative of Yamaguchi-gumi left the hall, where there were only odds and ends of the banquet. Xu took an enjoyable sip of his tea.</p><br/><p> \"Has grandpa left?\"</p><br/><p> His guard craned his neck at him. \"He got home safely...\"</p><br/><p> \"Ha!\" Xu put his cup down on the table. \"A strong wind is coming... My soldiers are ready to fight...\" [1]</p><br/><p> The Peking Opera echoed in the empty hall.</p><br/><p> They will play a role in Chinatown. There is another group waiting on the streets, who loves our motherland even more than Chinese Freemasons. They are former Chinese soldiers. They are loyal, well-armed and ready to risk their lives to protect Chinatown.</p><br/><p> \"Release the news to Han Zhujiu and his guys,\" Xu instructed his guard. \"Yamaguchi-gumi will move a large quantity of white powder [2] to the Lower East Side. They will give those Japanese a lesson.\"</p><br/><p>Yamaguchi Tsutomu has a long way ahead of her. Italian and Mexican businessmen won't let her in the drug business. They will detain the Japanese visitors in New York. It will be interesting!</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll kill them all...\" [3]</p><br/><p> It was a beautiful morning in New York. Qin Guan was admiring the location of the CK fall collection launching event. It would be held at a cafe on the Upper East Side.</p><br/><p> He didn't know New York well, but when he was led to the hall, he realized it was a unique place.</p><br/><p> The Russian tearoom, which was decorated like an ordinary Manhattan cafe, had a hidden beautiful inner world.</p><br/><p> Every restaurant and building on the Upper East Side was full of intricate details.</p><br/><p> The Russian tearoom had been founded by the Russian Royal Ballet Group, which had wanted to provide a gathering place for Russians in New York. It had become a club for film stars and politicians by then though.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan handed his backpack to the waiter. Madonna used to be a waitress there.</p><br/><p> The hall was decorated with red and gold ornaments of a traditional Russian style. There were crystal ceiling lamps and countless oil paintings in the room. The whole restaurant was as beautiful and luxurious as a royal palace.</p><br/><p> Thanks to its Baroque style, the hall was like the resplendent, magnificent Russian palace. Only the first floor was open to the public though.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan didn't look around. As a guy of fine taste, the luxurious hall hadn\u2019t shocked him.</p><br/><p> The CK launch event would take place on the second private floor. The VIP meeting room was only open to large-scale gatherings. Qin Guan went in, showing no interest in the transparent crystal floor or the glaze-colored ceiling. What impressed him was the 15-feet bear ice sculpture standing in the lounge.</p><br/><p> It was only mid-October. It must have taken a lot of work to make it stand there.</p><br/><p> Then he realized his ignorance. The gorgeous light was not coming from the ceiling lamps.</p><br/><p>[1] Peking Opera</p><br/><p>[2] Drugs</p><br/><p>[3] Peking Opera</p><br/>\n</div>"}

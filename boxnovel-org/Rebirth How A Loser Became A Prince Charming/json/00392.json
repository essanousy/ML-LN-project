The young man ran as fast as he could against the chilling wind. Even the string on his white hoodie was flying in the wind.</p><br/><p>The black iron defence couldn\u2019t block his desire of life. His chasers automatically split into two groups.</p><br/><p> \"Go, Qin Guan, go!\"</p><br/><p> The Columbia students didn't know what had happened. They just cheered for the popular boy, making the chasers hesitate.</p><br/><p> What will we do with the boy if we catch him? Could this cause us trouble?</p><br/><p> People with high IQ tended to think too much. They sped up their steps. Their prey had long legs, so he was getting further and further away.</p><br/><p> The chasers stopped, completely out of breath. They could do nothing but return to watch the match in anger.</p><br/><p> According to an old saying, extreme joy begot sorrow. By then, John, who had escaped successfully thanks to his familiarity with the campus and the protection of his fellow students, had changed his clothes and returned to the court arrogantly. He wanted to enjoy his girlfriend\u2019s performance and show off his achievement to everyone.</p><br/><p> It was not his style to walk at night wearing expensive clothes. Suddenly, he was discovered.</p><br/><p> \"Hey! He was the mastermind! Catch him!\"</p><br/><p> Everyone ran towards John. He doesn\u2019t seem like an influential guy.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan misled me! John ran up to the Columbia spectator stands. Fights were breaking out both inside and outside the court.</p><br/><p> The friendliest match between the two universities had ended.</p><br/><p> Columbia had undoubtedly lost the game, but they were the clear winner. After going around the campus, Qin Guan eventually returned to the court and saw Joseph smiling at him with a bloody nose and a swollen face.</p><br/><p> The main scorer was waving at him firmly.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei and Qin Guan exchanged a glance. When most of the people had left, they were finally able to go greet Guan Jian.</p><br/><p>Joseph cast a glance at Guan. \"Don't panic. Call me if you need me.\"</p><br/><p>\"He is my friend, Guan Jian.\" Qin Guan patted Joseph on the shoulder with a forced smile. Relieved, Joseph left the court with his uniform on his shoulder.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan turned to Guan Jian. \"I rarely come to New York. We can have dinner with He Ming and Lan Jin and take a look at their club.\"</p><br/><p> \"Okay, no problem.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei saw the refitted luxury cars at the entrance. Lan Jin's VOLVO was a good example. Only one broken part would take two months to repair. This was supposed to be a low-key luxury, but whole family fortunes were being spent on it.</p><br/><p> The three of them arrived at the club. There were freight tankers and private wharfs at the New York harbor. A medium-sized yacht served as their meeting place on the water.</p><br/><p> Acquaintances had no need for courtesy.</p><br/><p> The New York harbor was pure and clean. There were no tall buildings around, so the place was very open.</p><br/><p> Stepping on the cracking wooden floor, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei reached the private dock.</p><br/><p> Owners of yachts were not poor men, but not everyone was a rich guy. About 4% to 5% of American families owned a yacht. One didn't need a license to drive it.</p><br/><p> After the sunset, the lights lit up around the dock. There were colorful lights hanging on the larger yachts, shining down on the sea surface at night.</p><br/><p> They had bought a middle-sized tanker, about 15 meters long. It was enough for the five of them to stand on. Besides, the deck was large enough to satisfy their needs.</p><br/><p> A cool tow truck designed especially for the tanker was parked beside it. Qin Guan pointed to the truck.</p><br/><p> \"Lan Jin bought it, I guess.\"</p><br/><p> Lan looked excited. \"How do you know that? Are you a fan of mine?\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes, such a silly thing could only belong to you...\"</p><br/><p> The cars were for the families living far from the riverside or the seaside, who parked their yachts in the harbor. In New York though, where the yachts were always in the water, the cars were of no use.</p><br/><p> The hair on Lan Jin's head hung down limply. He was humiliated by his idol once again.</p><br/><p> \"Did Lan Jin buy this?\" Qin Guan asked again.</p><br/><p> Everyone looked at the small tuna-like yacht on the right.</p><br/><p> \"Yes...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

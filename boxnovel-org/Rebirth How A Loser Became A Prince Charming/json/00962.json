Then, Sister Xue pulled Qin Guan away to fill in a form.</p><br/><p>It was an application for the Chinese Television and Acting Association.</p><br/><p>In the past, actors had been employed by the government. These days though, they all followed the international standards and worked as freelancers. Thus, regulating their behavior, clarifying their direction when it came to work and life, and setting goals for the media had become the government's job.</p><br/><p>Due to the lack of standards, some actors who became famous overnight had a very negative influence on the public. They engaged in fights, drove under the influence, took drugs and generally embarrassed the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>The association, which had been an initiative of actors from the Chinese mainland, had been founded in collaboration with other influential Chinese actors living abroad. It was actually an independent society approved by the government and the SARFT.</p><br/><p>As a famous actor, Qin Guan had to support the association at its new beginning.</p><br/><p>When he filled in the paperwork, Qin Guan was informed about the general guidelines of the association. The guidelines seemed like an official document, which made him feel suspicious.</p><br/><p>This seemingly spontaneous society was actually a national association of actors controlled by the government. All its members had to be careful what they said and did in public.</p><br/><p>The admission criteria and fees confirmed Qin Guan's suspicions.</p><br/><p>People like him, who had won awards both domestically and internationally, could become members directly without paying any fees, but even ordinary actors only had to pay 10-20 yuan annually.</p><br/><p>Such a fee was not enough to pay for a tea party, let alone a grand gala.</p><br/><p>Is there perhaps a selfless sponsor involved? God knows!</p><br/><p>Before he could come back to his senses, Sister Xue handed Qin Guan two certificates.</p><br/><p>\"What are these?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your professional qualification certificates.\"</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck...\"</p><br/><p>The two red certificates were his Acting Certification and his Membership Card.</p><br/><p>The second one was easy to understand, but the first one... Qin Guan had never taken any acting exams.</p><br/><p>\"It's a reward. The chairman of the association said that you can get it without taking an exam. It would be ridiculous for you to sit such an exam. It's a reward. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>He was getting the special treatment for winning every acting award in existence.</p><br/><p>I should express my appreciation to the organization and the directors.</p><br/><p>\"Who is the chairman this year?\"</p><br/><p>\"Tang Guoqiang.\"</p><br/><p>He's not an acquaintance of mine. I'll do this later.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that he would meet those nationally-exclusive actors later.</p><br/><p>As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, he received a document from the association. They were notifying him about the importance of the right direction of TV and entertainment news, as well as the severe punishment of spreading fake news.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused by the notice, but the staff of \"Cheers! Good Boys!\" explained everything to him.</p><br/><p>\"You must ignore the media, sir. There have been a lot of fabricated news lately. Reporters are very inventive when it comes to making up news about social affairs. Fake news have been published in magazines and newspapers. Some were even broadcast on TV. They have been causing chaos everywhere. This is a very big deal.\"</p><br/><p>What was going on? Qin Guan was curious.</p><br/><p>Wang let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\"Forget it. Just finish your job first. As soon as you are done, I'll send you all the relative material at the hotel.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. Just don't forget.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

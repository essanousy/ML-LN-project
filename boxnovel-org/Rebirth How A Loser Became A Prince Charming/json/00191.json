When he went out of the dressing room, several crew members silently put snacks in his hand.</p><br/><p>What a considerate crew! Qin Guan said goodbye to Xu Zheng, Zhang Ting and the other actors on the set and left officially.</p><br/><p>Exhuasted, he returned to his dormitory. Only when he lay down on his bed did he realize that the semester was coming to an end and exam season was approaching. Tomorrow he would be taking his first exam!</p><br/><p>He jumped out of bed and took out a dust-covered flashlight from a tool box under his bed. I\u2019m a rich man now, but I still need that scholarship to show my academic achievements.</p><br/><p>Besides, he also had to keep Bu and Wang\u2019s books. He really had to work hard.</p><br/><p>What was happening? Why were his roommates getting up one by one?</p><br/><p>\"You dressed up like a miner and tied a flashlight to your head! We are not deaf! We heard you ask Wang Lei about what the tutor said about the exam!</p><br/><p>They couldn't sleep thanks to Qin Guan's activities, so they decided to study all night long.</p><br/><p>They lit up candles, which made the whole room look like a mourning hall. It was not a good idea to study under the light of the lamps in the corridor. There were too many mosquitoes outside!</p><br/><p>Not long after, they began to chat. The topic was switched naturally to their plans for the future.</p><br/><p>\"What are your plans after graduation? Everyone knows Qin Guan will go to the US. He won\u2019t be competing for a postgraduate recommendation with us, or hunting for a job at the talent fair.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang scratched his head as he replied, \"My credits are enough for four years. Our tutor informed me that he will be my personal tutor next year, so I\u2019ll get my postgraduate degree at our college.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Li Jie was stunned by the news. I had originally planned on studying hard during my senior year to get a postgraduate degree, but Liu will already be a postgraduate student next year! He skipped a grade again!</p><br/><p>His roommates were amused by his thunderstruck expression as another dagger was stabbed in his heart. \"It seems that two guys from our dormitory will be postgraduate students in the future. One has already succeeded.\"</p><br/><p>Li Jie felt like crying, but he could not produce any tears.</p><br/><p>Wang Lei said leisurely, \"I\u2019ll get my diploma next year and choose a suitable job at the recruiting fair. After two years, I\u2019ll try to take the exam and become a Certified Public Accountant. Then a promotion and a salary increase will follow.\"</p><br/><p>It was a solid career plan from a sensible guy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hugged Wang and tried to tempt him, \"In two years, when you get your CPA certificate, I\u2019ll be returning to China. We could set up a business together then!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Lei narrowed his eyes and stared at Qin Guan intensely. \"In the US, accountants, actuaries and auditors are completely different from their peers in China. You can't bring back what you\u2019ll learn there, and you won't be able to get a part-time job as an accountant in the US, as your Chinese diploma will mean nothing there. Besides, your postgraduate schedule will be too tight for you to get a job at a large company.\"</p><br/><p>\"Judging by your pride, you won\u2019t ask financial support from your family. Your girlfriend will go to either MIT, Harvard, or Columbia. I think you will choose a university in New York, as there\u2019s a top fashion industry there.\"</p><br/><p>\"After you graduate, you will return to China to look after your parents. Then you can have a talk with me. I\u2019ll already be an elite CFO at a national enterprise or a state-run bank.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's my guess. You go now!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless. What the f*ck shall I say now?</p><br/><p>Thoroughly rejected, Qin Guan lay down on the desk next to Li Jie.</p><br/><p>Mu Lejiang massaged his nose shyly. \"I\u2019m planning on marrying my girlfriend as soon as I graduate. Then we\u2019ll return to my hometown, and I\u2019ll find a job in the provincial capital, which is thirsty for talented young men like me. I\u2019ll get promoted soon. My girlfriend is a dancer, so she can be a teacher or open her own studio. I\u2019ll support her.\"</p><br/><p>The serious academic plan was suddenly replaced by a warm family future. Everyone admired the couple\u2019s future happiness and wished them their best.</p><br/><p>\"Send us an invitation to your wedding!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! You will be my groomsmen!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah!\"</p><br/><p>They all rushed up to him happily and embraced him.</p><br/><p>Then they returned to their seats and picked up their books again.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ye Dong seemed to recall something. He turned to Mu and said, \"You two are the perfect couple. You care about each other and make compromises. Yang Jing and I are exhausted though. Our future looks dim.\"</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed as Ye Dong talked about his problems, \"My father and I have decided that I\u2019ll stay in the capital after graduation. I\u2019ll go fetch my parents as soon as I have some financial security in the city. Maybe I\u2019ll take the exam and become a civil servant. Our tutor asked me to stay and work here at college, but I refused. It's a good chance, but it\u2019s not enough for me. I\u2019ll probably get a recommendation and work for the Ministry of Finance and Economics. I\u2019ll work hard and climb up the hierarchy if I get hired. Gold always shines in the end.\"</p><br/><p>Before Liu Xiaoyang could say anything, Ye Dong stopped him with a gesture. \"I know what you want to say. I\u2019m not a native, but except for the staff at the bottom of the hierarchy, there are few natives at the top. I\u2019m patient. They say the salary at the Ministry is not bad anyway, so I won't starve to death.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

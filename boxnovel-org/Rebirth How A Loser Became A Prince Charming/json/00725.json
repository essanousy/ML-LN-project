Throwing his glasses at Bu Qinglu, he turned back to Chen Kang with a hand over his heart.</p><br/><p>\"If the news were published on my blog, Chinese fans would be very interested. New York and Beijing will get very friendly soon, and I'll be their ambassador. What would the international consequences be? I have one million foreign fans. If they found out about this, what do you think they would do?\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is the mastermind behind this? It must be Mr. Wang Jianlin, whom you think I'm not qualified to meet.\"</p><br/><p>By the time Qin Guan finished his performance, Chen Kang had started sweating. Son of a b*tch! He is so crafty! I can't take responsibility for this decision. I have to stay away from this affair.</p><br/><p>The man made a decision immediately, \"The sooner you meet him, the better. I'll contact him as soon as possible. Just give me a minute!\"</p><br/><p>Talent was in great demand in the 21st century.</p><br/><p>Chen Kang asked for his phone back and dialled a number quickly. As everyone watched, he described the whole matter in the concise words of a lawyer.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, this is Chen Kang.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you are calling me at this point, you must have good news. Did you buy another house?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, listen to me. I was caught by the residents while I was on the job. They couldn't do anything to me, so they just let me go. There is a troublesome owner we didn't take into consideration though. The real estate agency has been withholding information from us. The strange man who purchased all those houses is sitting right in front of me. His name is Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, the Qin Guan! The international award-winning actor! The favorite man of all domestic portal websites. All those houses are his property. He wants to meet Mr. Wang. If you want to take care of this fast, tell Mr. Wang as soon as possible. I think Mr. Qin would agree to a private settlement.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I'll be waiting for your response.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Kang hung up and smiled in a flattering way. \"If everything goes well, they'll contact Mr. Wang tomorrow. Can I have your number?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone knows the number of my firm. As a group company making investments in so many fields, Wanda will surely know my official number. You are a smart man though. You want my number for yourself, don't you? It's my private number you want, isn't it?\"</p><br/><p>Hey, award-winning actors are supposed to be good at acting, not reasoning!</p><br/><p>Chen Kang wasn't ashamed. This caused no substantial damage to him after all. Qin Guan turned to Bu Qinglu. \"I think our company could change its law firm, Brother Bu. Chen here would be a good choice.\"</p><br/><p>\"I agree.\"</p><br/><p>\"My number is 138010XXXXX. Call me back. I need a chamber counselor. The payment is reasonable, but it's not a high-paying position. You could do it pro bono.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Kang typed the number into his phone fast, murmuring, \"The palest ink is better than the best memory. I consider myself pretty good, but I'm a little expensive.\"</p><br/><p>Satisfied with his shamelessness, Qin Guan stood up and smiled at his neighbors.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone will be able to sleep at night from now on. Nothing will happen here, at least not before I reach an agreement with Mr. Wang.\"</p><br/><p>\"I think the problem will be solved soon, but I don't want anyone to get greedy. Honest men don't behave like that.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded. They had seen what Qin Guan had done for them. The young man had fought for them and taken all the responsibility on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>As a result, everyone saw him off warmly when he left. They were all concerned about him living alone in the city, and they expressed their kindness in a direct way.</p><br/><p>They presented him with some salted duck eggs and frozen dumplings. It seemed that they were afraid that Qin Guan would starve to death at home.</p><br/><p>As a foodie, Qin Guan would never turn away food. As he left in Bu's jeep, he noticed the surprised expression in Chen's eyes. When he got home, he put the food in the empty fridge. Then he finally had some time to clear his mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The tutor said from behind Lan, \"Please sit back down. We\u2019ll begin our class now.\"</p><br/><p>Lan gestured at Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei before stealing a glance at the two guys behind them. \"See you after class.\"</p><br/><p>Before his voice could fade away, He Ming spoke out, \"Boy Lan, sit there.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" The three of them were taken back. Guan Jian laughed. \"Good Boy Lan. You, the redhead! Sit there. Never change seat.\"</p><br/><p>All kinds of feelings welled up in his heart. Lan Jin had no idea what was going on. Shall I thank Qin Guan for this or my mother?</p><br/><p>After such a long training course, he was finally accepted by that mysterious group.</p><br/><p>He snorted and glanced at his previous seat proudly. The surrounding students were looking at him with a slightly confused, jealous expression.</p><br/><p>Lan laughed and pulled out the chair on the other side of Qin Guan, holding his head high. He sat down as if he was about to die a martyr\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>Cui Jun didn't attend the class that day. Maybe the coward wouldn't be back anytime soon. If he did, he would beat his chest and stamp his feet in anger.</p><br/><p>Lan finished the class in a daydream. He fit in with that group naturally with his funny behavior.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was living a happy life while Sister Xue was having great trouble. She had been left at the reception hall of the Citizen offices in Beijing for over an hour. Their meeting time was postponed again and again.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue looked at her watch impatiently and walked up to the reception desk. \"May I know when they\u2019ll receive me? I\u2019ve been waiting for a long time. I\u2019m also busy myself.\"</p><br/><p>Actually, Sister Xue was lying. Huang Bo had joined a new show one week ago. She was completely free. So what though? It was impolite to be late for a meeting.</p><br/><p>The girl behind the reception desk was in a pickle, when suddenly a smiling assistant walked over and took a 90-degree bow before Sister Xue. \"Sorry for the delay. My director had another meeting. It's finished now. Follow me, please.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue held her temper in check. She was not accustomed to such courtesy. She followed the assistant along a long corridor and pushed the door of the director's office open.</p><br/><p>There were two serious men sitting in the office. One of them was old with grey hair. He was sitting on a guest seat, while the owner of the office was standing beside him, listening to his words and nodding repeatedly.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and the assistant waited outside until they finished their conversation. Then they walked in at the director\u2019s indication.</p><br/><p>Shanchuanyour was afraid, as the board of directors of the Citizen group had just divided the 56 branches into two parts. The general manager of East Asia, old Mr. Zhuchuanlongfu, had suddenly arrived in China that day.</p><br/><p>Shanchuan was a little nervous. He was wondering if Mr. Zhuchuan would be satisfied with his business arrangement in China.</p><br/><p>He felt sorry for unlucky Sister Xue. He asked Mr. Zhuchuan silently out of consideration, and the old gentleman gestured to him in invitation, indicating that Shanchuan could go on with his work.</p><br/><p>Shanchuan nodded at his assistant, who led Sister Xue to another couch and gently closed the door.</p><br/><p>They didn't beat around the bush. They made their intentions clear right away and got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was promoting Qin Guan, saliva splashing out of her mouth. The two Japanese men couldn't control themselves. They smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Ms. Xue, aren\u2019t you exaggerating a little? This is just a routine meeting before the audition. Aren\u2019t you afraid the boy will disappoint us later?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue sneered and apologized right away, \"I\u2019m not sneering at you, but at the way you\u2019re thinking. You don\u2019t believe me. There is an old Chinese saying that says that seeing is believing though, so let me show you my best model.\"</p><br/><p>She handed Qin Guan's zed cards to them.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had played a little word trick here. She had only one model, so Qin Guan was of course the best one.</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan and Shanchuan took the cards with a smile. They had met plenty of old ladies in Japan who liked to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p><br/><p>They fell silent right away. Sister Xue looked at them with contempt. Do you believe me now?</p><br/><p>Mr. Zhuchuan didn't say anything, but he kept caressing the VOGUE cover photo for a long, long time.</p><br/><p>Shanchuan had to speak. Coughing, he said, \"I apologize for my attitude. It's true that facts speak louder than words. I\u2019m shocked by your model. I originally thought Japanese stars such as Fushan, Fanding and Jincheng Wu, who are half-Japanese, have god-sent beauty. I can\u2019t believe we found someone better than them.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue raised her eyebrows proudly. Living in such a tiny area has limited your vision. You didn't trust me, but now you\u2019ve been rendered speechless, huh?</p><br/><p>Shanchuan coughed softly and put Qin Guan's cards on the table. \"Mr. Qin has some practical drawbacks though. Take Mr. Jincheng for example. He has plenty of fans for his films in Hong Kong and the mainland. The other Japanese stars also have a great reputation in Asian entertainment circles. Mr. Qin is too far behind to catch up with them.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

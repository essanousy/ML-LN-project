He simply sent the orders and the DV of the show directly to the boss.</p><br/><p>In less than five minutes, all the relative material was on the boss\u2019 desk.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew if the boss would be satisfied with the result.</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing's agent received a call from the boss of the SS Group as he was heading back into town in his business car.</p><br/><p>When he hung up, the expression on his face did not promise any good news.</p><br/><p>\"Who was that?\" Shao Xiaobing raised his head from the backseat, but kept his eyes closed.</p><br/><p>Thinking it over, his agent replied carefully, \"The boss of the SS Group.\"</p><br/><p>Shao sat up slightly and asked calmly, \"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>His agent made an ambiguous statement, \"He was not very satisfied with the first group of orders. He said that we played him, and without our promise of payment reduction and sharing part of our promoting resources, he wouldn't have changed the main show model at such short notice. That unworthy...\" He lowered his voice, as he was aware that Shao had grown extremely quiet.</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the car as the assistant held tight to the steering wheel with trembling hands.</p><br/><p>\"Bang! Bang!\"</p><br/><p>The assistant\u2019s seat was hit vigorously. The wheel shook from the sudden attack as the car nearly jumped out of the road.</p><br/><p>When the assistant took control of the car again, still suffering from the shock, he heard Shao\u2019s gentle voice, \"You are so careless! My agent will decide your punishment. One more time, and you\u2019ll get fired.\"</p><br/><p>Depressed and confused, the assistant continued to drive without a word. Who kicked my seat from behind? It was lucky we were in the suburbs. If we had been on the highway, we would have all died! Now I know that you\u2019re not just an insidious, two-faced person, but also a mad man! I can\u2019t stand you anymore!</p><br/><p>(Not long after, the assistant handed in his resignation.)</p><br/><p>Watching the scenery retreat at high speed outside the car window, Shao told his agent, \"As far as I remember, the original main show model was a green hand. Was his name Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>His agent swallowed his saliva. \"Yes, Qin Guan. A newcomer from New Silk Road. He has won the national New Face Model Competition.\"</p><br/><p>Shao smiled as he murmured, \"I like to make friends with winners. Check what publicity he has had recently.\"</p><br/><p>His agent nodded unconsciously and let out a relieved breath. Not too bad. He just asked about his publicity. Nothing important.</p><br/><p>Soon, he found the information from an old friend. \"He\u2019s done an inside spread for a magazine and he has an ad background.\"</p><br/><p>Shao closed his eyes and leaned back against the seat again, whispering, \"A green hand with minimal publicity...\" The colorful neon lights left spots as they flickered across his face and disappeared in the dark.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was feeling very happy. Sister Xue had arranged a big surprise. Xie Feng had attended the show as a new prominent designer.</p><br/><p>He had watched the whole show as a special guest and wanted to contact the winner he had picked himself.</p><br/><p>He was going to hold a solo exhibition in Milan for the first time. Surely, with his simple qualifications and experience, Qin Guan couldn't convince him that he was suitable for an international level T stage.</p><br/><p>However, Xie would also hold a small-scale show in China before that, and he wanted to invite Qin Guan. According to his observation, Qin Guan was qualified enough for the show.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was extremely excited about the news. Qin Guan had won the trust of a top domestic designer. With his help, a little-known model could become popular easily.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen was jealous of his opportunity, which confused Qin Guan. Ouyang prayed to the gods every day. How come I\u2019m the one the gods favor?</p><br/><p>Extreme joy could beget sorrow though. Several days later, Sister Xue was hit again by more news.</p><br/><p>Ni Dalei called her and said, \"I\u2019m sorry, Xue. The editor of the magazine just called me to say that the interview would be cancelled. The chief editor found a more influential model for the inner pages.\"</p><br/><p>\"But they had several models make that poster together! Why did they cancel so suddenly? And it's not a famous magazine! How can they invite an influential model?\"</p><br/><p>Ni Dalei was also sorry about the temporary cancellation, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. After chatting with her for a while, he hung up.</p><br/><p>Soon, his phone rang again. \"This is New Silk Road. Yes, are you the new director? I know you. Do you want background on a model? Yes, he can interview this weekend. What? You have found the right model among the background models? Well, that won't influence the interview. You still want a background model, right? What? You have enough background models? What a pity!\" Ni sighed and hung up again.</p><br/><p>What was happening? Cancellation calls came one after the other. The reason was not the model himself, but various inexplicable excuses. Qin Guan was passed up without even a chance to interview. What an unlucky guy!</p><br/><p>In the meantime, Shao Xiaobing's agent was also answering phone calls.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much, editor! Of course, Shao will arrive on time. It's you who\u2019s giving us an opportunity! It's nothing. We can enjoy a mutual promotion and step forward together.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Money would not be a problem. There were lots of sponsors that supported Qin Guan, including Armani and Columbia Pictures.</p><br/><p>Generous rich men were rare, let alone men who were interested in an Asian star, so the Hollywood History Trust wouldn't let that chance go so easily. Plus, most of the members of the Chamber of Commerce were collaborating with Qin Guan's QC firm. The hard-working Asian personnel had impressed them.</p><br/><p>Thus, Qin Guan got approved without any delay.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was standing right by the spot where his star would be molded, wearing Armani Haute Couture. Reporters were lingering all around him. There was a long table covered by red velvet. Empty cups were mounted on it like a tower.</p><br/><p>The cups would be filled with a champagne that cost 10,000 dollars per bottle. Right across from the cups was a small message board with Qin Guan's picture.</p><br/><p>The organizer attached great importance to the ceremony. Most of the actors, producers and directors who had cooperated with Qin Guan had been invited.</p><br/><p>The organizer wanted to advertise the ceremony as both a celebration of the entertainment circle and a chance to promote tourism.</p><br/><p>Chinese tourists had been pouring into America lately, so pleasing them would bring the US bigger profits.</p><br/><p>More and more tourists gathered behind the warning line. Asians were given the best vantage points. Even Sister Xue felt anxious when she saw the crowd.</p><br/><p>Most of Qin Guan's friends had gone to witness this milestone in his career, including Qu Xuemei and Zhang Yimou. Even Julia Roberts and Drew Barrymore were waving at him from the crowd.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was really excited. All he could do was say thank you!</p><br/><p>\"Brother Qin, I'm over here!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around at the sound of the voice and saw Jay Chou. Before he could respond, the host walked over to warn him that the ceremony was about to begin.</p><br/><p>\"Wait for me after the ceremony!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fixed his bow and walked to the edge of the red carpet, which led to the long table. It looked gorgeous against the background of the black, marble-paved avenue.</p><br/><p>\"Let's welcome Qin Guan, the owner of the 98th main street star and 1998th Hollywood star! He is the youngest Golden Globe winner in existence. Despite his young age, he has already won awards both in Cannes and Berlin. He is a Chinese ambassador in America who has contributed a lot to the exchange between occidental and oriental culture...\"</p><br/><p>\"Thus, the judges reached the unanimous decision that Qin Guan should have his own star on the Walk of Fame, the Holy Land of filmmaking!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone applauded loudly.</p><br/><p>\"Now, I'll surrender the floor to the lucky man...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's friends and the reporters applauded again as screams were heard from behind the warning line.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hello once more!\"</p><br/><p>\"Come on, baby!\"</p><br/><p>The truck hit their car again. Qin Guan tried to keep a distance from those crazy guys.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck!\" one of the girls shouted angrily. She showed the men her middle finger and opened her backpack. She took a white plastic bottle out and shouted at the driver, \"Steady there!\"</p><br/><p>The driver was a good partner. The car was moving steadily.</p><br/><p>The bold girl opened the cap and sprayed the liquid onto the truck. It sprinkled on the front window and the man's body.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smelled a familiar flavor as aromatic as Erguotou.</p><br/><p>Hard alcohol.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei exchanged another glance and sped up desperately. The men were also clear on what it was.</p><br/><p>\"F*cking b*tch! it's alcohol!\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop!\"</p><br/><p>Horrified, they noticed the lighter in the girl\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>The truck was driven away from the road. Spare our lives, please!</p><br/><p>A strange phenomenon took place on the road. All the cars kept a distance from the girls\u2019 car, leaving a spare space around it. After their crazy actions, they followed Qin Guan's car closely. Qin Guan\u2019s driving got smoother as all the drivers yielded kindly.</p><br/><p>Thanks to those crazy girls, Qin Guan reached his destination a few minutes earlier than the original schedule.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know why the outlet needed reconstruction until they arrived at the square. The original commercial district couldn't house that many brands. The small shopping mall was filled with about 300 brands.</p><br/><p>The expansion and reconstruction had been delayed though.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sent Cong Nianwei to the reception of the administration, where a group of strangers was gathered. They were all her competitors in the bidding. All of them seemed capable and cunning.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was worried about her. He sent her to the Columbia group, murmuring, \"Take care of yourself. Call me if there is any trouble. I will be on the deserted construction site over there.\"</p><br/><p>He pointed to a large construction site. When Cong Nianwei nodded, he left the reception reluctantly.</p><br/><p>Several small tails were following him.</p><br/><p>\"What will he do?\"</p><br/><p> \"We know his destination. We can go shopping first.\"</p><br/><p>The desire for shopping exceeded their admiration for their idol. Qin Guan felt relieved. Ignorance was the most powerful weapon.</p><br/><p>He arrived at the site soon and found the staff already there. They had settled into a town near Woodbury, so they were not affected by the traffic jam.</p><br/><p>\"Morning, Qin Guan!\" the other judges greeted their Asian partner.</p><br/><p>\"Shall we begin?\"</p><br/><p>\"Where are the girls?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a commotion at the entrance of the warehouse.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! Let go of my hair!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you following Mr. Qin so sneakily? Crazy fans, huh?\"</p><br/><p>Some models were fighting with the girls.</p><br/><p>The cameraman dashed out. I like it! The audience will like it! It\u2019s a wonderful fight! Go!</p><br/><p>When they were separated, the models\u2019 hair was messy. The girls had escaped without the slightest damage. Whey they saw the cameraman and the familiar faces, they realized that their idol was at work.</p><br/><p>Sorry! See you around!</p><br/><p>They escaped as fast as possible, shouting loudly, \"We love you, Qin Guan! Cheers!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan cast a helpless look at the camera. My face will be seen all over the country.</p><br/><p>His partners and the crew burst into laughter, making fun of the ashamed models and Qin Guan, who pretended to be invisible.</p><br/><p>\"The scene was pretty good. Thank you, Qin Guan, for providing the material!\"</p><br/><p>They went back to work quickly. Qu arrived at noon in her Mini Cooper.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had finished his work by then. Standing in a corner, they talked about the results of the investigation.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know anyone who has been after you recently?\" Qu strengthened her back.</p><br/><p>\"After me?\" Qin Guan was at a loss. \"When? I have no idea...\"</p><br/><p>Qu was disappointed. What a careless guy! </p><br/><p>She buried her face into her hands weakly. \"Don't focus on the details.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

A man was busy working at one corner of the small room.</p><br/><p>\"Something is glowing...\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue narrowed her eyes. Before her voice could fade away, the man looked up. A big bare head was shining under the lamp.</p><br/><p>\"Come take a look. Tell me if you see anything you like...\"</p><br/><p>The man didn't stand up to greet them. Instead, he buried his head back in his work.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qin Guan entered the shop, looking carefully at the finished and semi-finished costumes on the models. After browsing through all the outfits in the shop, Sister Xue let out a long sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>The man was a gifted designer. His work had even qualified for an independent small-scale fashion show. He was a gem hiding in a small corner.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue always appreciated talent, so she concealed her excitement and tried to talk to the man.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me. All the costumes in here are your work, right?\"</p><br/><p>The bald man was really happy that his customers had not been scared away by the prices of his work. </p><br/><p>Looking up from the sewing machine, he answered, \"Yes, I made them all with my own hands. Look at this one! It's traditional Chinese satin with an embedded pattern made of feathers and paillettes.\"</p><br/><p>He stood up to show them the costume. When he saw his customers clearly though, he was shocked.</p><br/><p>\"You are Qin Guan! The Asian top model!\"</p><br/><p>As an insider of the fashion circle, he was able to recognize Qin Guan at first sight.</p><br/><p>\"Hello! Nice to meet you, Andre Gn.\" Qin Guan stretched a hand out to him with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"How do you know my name?\"</p><br/><p>\"Did I make a mistake? I saw the name of your store and thought that it must be your name.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue looked back and saw the sparkling letters embroidered on the silk threads of the curtain. They spelled out the name Qin Guan had mentioned.</p><br/><p>It was too difficult for costumers to read though.</p><br/><p>The bald man flushed with excitement and rubbed his wet hands before taking Qin Guan's hand.</p><br/><p>\"Nice to meet you, too! Don't call me Andrew Gn. You can just call me by my Chinese name. I\u2019m Yin Changtao!\"</p><br/><p>\"I have read about your story in magazines and newspapers. Although you began your career in America, you are still a favorite of European fashion magazines.\"</p><br/><p>\"I can't believe I am finally seeing you in person! You are much more handsome than you look in your photos. I\u2019m so excited! You are a source of inspiration for designers. So many thoughts are running through my head right now! You are exquisite!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was speechless. The strong man seemed fierce, but he acted like a tame dog.</p><br/><p>After some time, Yin Changtao finally calmed down. Then the three of them began to talk about a possible collaboration.</p><br/><p>When Sister Xue introduced her proposal, she saw the man's eyes turn red. Tears started running down his face, but he cleaned them with his sleeve.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you... I would like to be a part of your team!\"</p><br/><p>He was so straightforward that Sister Xue didn't have the heart to mess with him.</p><br/><p>\"Come to New York with your work. Please read the contract carefully though. You are an independent designer after all. You have to study the terms carefully.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much!\" the man cried out at her considerate words. If Sister Xue and Qin Guan had not shown up that day, he would have had to find labor work at a construction site.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had graduated from the Central Saint Martin\u2019s College in 1996, he had been leading a poor life. The few customers he had didn't make a difference for him and his store.</p><br/><p>Yin had nearly given up his career. He thought his style might not be accepted by the mainstream fashion circle, so he had been about to abandon the dream he had been cherishing ever since he was a child.</p><br/><p>It felt like Qin Guan had descended from Heaven that day and showed him the way to the top of the fashion circle. He had finally found the key to the international fashion week.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s forgive the Chinese-Singaporean, who had only read one classic in his life. By the way, it was \"A Dream in a Red Mansion\".</p><br/><p>Only the following idiom could express his feelings: Only spring can pay back the mercy of the dripping water.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't need to worry about the details. While Sister Xue and Yin Changtao were talking about the contract, he found a toyshop at the corner of the street.</p><br/><p>The store had a light green glass window and an ancient wooden door. Behind the glass were several cute dolls.</p><br/><p>After staring at them for a long time, Qin Guan felt like a child. He finally pushed the door open and entered the shop.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome!\"</p><br/><p>An old man with golden-framed glasses was standing behind a tall counter. He greeted Qin Guan without looking up from the tin soldier in his hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

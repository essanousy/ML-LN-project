Cong Nianwei thought he gave off a countryside vibe, but she had gotten used to his god-like presence on the stage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing a short robe, a pair of pants, and a square hat with bobbles. He opened his mouth and let out a clear, deep voice.</p><br/><p>\"I strode over to the Lantern Hall...\"</p><br/><p>His words were simple, and he spoke with an original Shandong Province dialect. He delivered his lines clearly, making it easy for everyone to understand.</p><br/><p>\"The cabbage lantern has curved leaves. The Chinese parsley lantern is a mess. The celery lantern looks like a steel saw. The spinach lantern looks like a bunch of swords.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was busy gesturing. There were too many things to show everyone.</p><br/><p>This was the first time most of the young audience members were watching Lv Opera, but they could all hear the lines clearly. Qin Guan's funny performance amused them. His act was a folk tale that was very close to life. Everyone's hearts warmed up as they heard his song.</p><br/><p>\"Garlic plants have thick roots and they are as thin as bolts. Spring onions are as straight as spears.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed in the air. \"Chilli peppers are really pointed...\"</p><br/><p>Peking Opera and Kun Opera did not feature such lines, but Lv Opera was famous for its simple words and unique Shandong accent. The two masters forgot their conflict and shook their heads along with Qin Guan's movements.</p><br/><p>The director was both happy and annoyed. He was happy with Qin Guan's performance. The award-winning actor was devoted to the opera. The director's mouth was wide open, and his eyes looked like crescent moons. Everyone felt like smiling.</p><br/><p>The makeup annoyed him though. F*ck! Everyone looked the same with makeup on. The audience would not recognize Qin Guan. They would have to use subtitles, or the TV audience would have no idea who the guy with the authentic Shandong accent was. He had won two acting awards in Europe after all!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished the classic scene in five minutes, singing, speaking, acting and performing acrobatics at a high speed. He hardly even took a breath. The audience had to struggle to keep up with him. In the end, he raised his voice and took a solemn, respectful pose, ending the scene smoothly.</p><br/><p>\"We enjoyed a good harvest in the Shandong Province. Let peace reign over the land...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan held his arms up and kept that pose for a while. The two old men were the first to come back to their senses. Tears were running down their cheeks. Qin Guan was certainly qualified to perform Lv Opera on CCTV.</p><br/><p>Everyone applauded with all their strength, reminding the stunned director that Qin Guan was finished.</p><br/><p>A thunderous applause filled the hall. Although Wang Xiaoya knew nothing about opera, she mimicked her uncle and applauded for handsome Uncle Qin.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan retired to the backstage area. Even a few minutes on the stage required a decade of training. The opera was gradually fading away from young people's memories. The inheritance of Chinese operas shouldered a heavy responsibility.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't express his mixed feelings. A copy of his performance was kept by the TV station.</p><br/><p>The gala was broadcast during the Lantern Festival. After enjoying the real lantern assembly, the audience tuned in to watch the local gala.</p><br/><p>The host and the participants remained the same, but they had heard that their favorite award-winning actor would perform during the gala.</p><br/><p>As a result, the people who visited the lanterns were less than usual. This indicated the importance they attached to the gala. After a long introduction from the host, the audience finally saw the performer they were so obsessed with.</p><br/><p>\"What the hell is that?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked by the opera. Their first response was to watch Qin Guan's character sing. They all found some interesting points in the opera.</p><br/><p>The lines were simple, interesting and easy to understand. The audience was so happy about this that they started talking about the performance online. Even though this was a family moment, a thread silently appeared on the Haijiao forum. Soon, it reached the top of the page.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is performing at the Lantern gala of Y city. As a local resident, I feel really happy.\"</p><br/><p>The post was like a drop of water in boiling oil.</p><br/><p>\"Liar! He can't be in China!\"</p><br/><p>\"He returned to China in October.\"</p><br/><p>\"Show me a picture. I won't believe you, unless you have proof!\"</p><br/><p>When similar queries starting coming from all directions, the author of the post responded again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

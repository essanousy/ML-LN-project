Sister Xue\u2019s Chinese models were also competing for a chance to participate in the event.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn\u2019t respond to Sister Xue's plan. Instead, he frowned slightly and asked a question about something he and Ye Dong had discussed the previous night.</p><br/><p>It was about the neglected potential of Asian designers.</p><br/><p>Although they only composed a small part of top brands, their classic style and perfect interpretation of oriental and occidental culture were quite different from those of European and American designers. </p><br/><p>As a result, their work was adored in Italy, France and the UK. They were also beloved among fashion critics. Maybe Chinese models could take advantage of this to open another gate.</p><br/><p>\"As far as I know, only a few Asian designers have their own independent brands, so why not create our own designer group? We could have control over our work and promote our own design studio\u2026\" Qin Guan suggested.</p><br/><p>\"We could play the roles of both the supplier and the buyer. That way, we would be more confident during our negotiations.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was nearly convinced, yet her brows were still furrowed. \"But where will I find such outstanding designers? Most design school graduates follow the standard procedure. They join a company and start out working as assistants to famous designers. A few years later, they leave and open their own shops. Their talent and confidence are lost in the process. Most of them become average designers. Besides, I can't steal assistants from high-end studios. They would unite and come after us.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled mysteriously and pointed to the bustling street outside the window.</p><br/><p>\"I have a tight schedule today. You have nothing to do on set, so maybe you could take a walk around. Maybe you\u2019ll find something!\"</p><br/><p>Before Sister Xue could make any further inquiries, the driver pulled over to the side of the road.</p><br/><p>\"We have arrived at your destination, Mr. Qin Guan. Have a nice day!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got out of the car slowly, winked at Sister Xue and turned around to greet director Nichols.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue stomped on the sidewalk before greeting the director with a warm smile.</p><br/><p>\"My boy! I\u2019m glad to see you look withered today. You must have thought about the role overnight. You are so dedicated to your art. I\u2019m looking forward to your perfect performance today!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue almost burst into laughter. He was just talking with a friend all night long!</p><br/><p>She had to protect Qin Guan\u2019s dignity though. Smiling, she pushed Qin Guan into the makeup room, where the stylist was waiting for him with some grey powder.</p><br/><p>In the next scene, Julia would betray Qin Guan. This would be the first time the ever-victorious doctor would experience failure.</p><br/><p>Larry happened to walk into his favorite club, which had changed into a gorgeous strip club.</p><br/><p>The depressed man found Natalie there. The hot girl had become a member of the adult club.</p><br/><p>The crew had spent a lot of money and energy on the scene. They couldn\u2019t film during the working hours of the club, so they had to work early in the morning.</p><br/><p>All the staff of the strip club, including the strippers, were paid extras.</p><br/><p>They were paid 10 dollars an hour, which was very low for Great Britain. Actors who thought of themselves as artists had more principles than those Americans living the American dream.</p><br/><p>An effortless cooperation between the actors would naturally speed up the process.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, you should look aroused in the scene. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't understand until he saw Natalie walk out of the fitting room. She was wearing a revealing stripper outfit.</p><br/><p>A T-string, a small bra and some swaying tassels were the only clothes on her body.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue fell into deep thought. At least he doesn\u2019t need to take off his clothes in this film. Only his partner has to show her body. Has he been cursed by someone?</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I won\u2019t leave until you finish the scene.\"</p><br/><p>Thank you.</p><br/><p>Natalie was a serious girl and a dedicated actress. She began warming up right next to Qin Guan. Soon, Sister Xue realized why.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

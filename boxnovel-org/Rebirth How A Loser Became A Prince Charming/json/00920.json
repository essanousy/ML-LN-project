Of course, they were all focused on the Venice Festival and wondering if the handsome man would win his final major European award.</p><br/><p>People were even betting on it, with odds of about 1.08. This meant that most people expected Qin Guan to succeed. They believed that he would definitely win an award at the Venice Film Festival.</p><br/><p>The Daily Express would be glad to get any news from him. The short interview took place in a quiet hall on the ground floor.</p><br/><p>\"Hi, Mr. Qin Guan. I'm Tom from the Daily Express. Thank you for your cooperation. I know you are really busy these days. Don't worry, I won't take up too much of your time. I only have a short list of questions.\"</p><br/><p>\"No worries, I still have some time left.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, thank you. First, I would like to ask the question that your English fans are most concerned about. I understand that both of your films have been shortlisted by the Venice Film Festival. What do you think about that? Will you make a grand slam this time?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shrugged with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"You are asking the wrong person. I think you should ask the judges and the audience instead. I hope the Venetian gods will give me their blessing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! You are really funny, Qin Guan. If you failed to win an award, would you question the organizing committee's criteria?\"</p><br/><p>\"Never!\" Qin Guan shook his head firmly. \"There are all kinds of factors in play. Plus, failing once doesn't mean anything. I'm new at the festival after all. I wll get another chance in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"I will win the award one day. I expect that I will win the Lifetime Achievement Award in a couple of decades...\"</p><br/><p>The young man's confidence helped the interview flow smoothly. Tom, who was curious about the Asian star's last words, decided to test him with an acute question.</p><br/><p>Thus, he skipped two questions and asked the very last one.</p><br/><p>\"The next question is...\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that the third one?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes...\"</p><br/><p>Tom cast a confused look at Qin Guan. Is something wrong?</p><br/><p>\"Everyone knows that Madame Tussauds is a way to keep in touch with people, just like our newspaper is. Thanks to its history and professionalism, the museum has managed to have a collection of sculptures with big historical significance or entertainment value. Today, your sculpture will be in the same place as Stalin's, Churchill's and Thatcher's. Do you think you deserve this? Can your fame and contribution even be compared to theirs?\"</p><br/><p>Tom had pulled a trick on him. As an entertainment star, Qin Guan belonged in a completely different field than those political figures.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at him.</p><br/><p>\"You are the funniest guy I have ever met, Tom. If I had passed the national examination for civil servants and worked for the Chinese government for 20 years, I would have been able to give you a better answer.\"</p><br/><p>\"As it is, I just want to say that every field has talented people. Maybe 100 years from now, my work will be considered a milestone in the history of the entertainment circle. You'll have to live longer to find out the answer.\"</p><br/><p>Tom was shocked. Qin Guan patted his shoulder and whispered, \"That was three questions.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, thank you for your time. It was nice to meet you.\"</p><br/><p>Tom shook Qin Guan's hand. Was that my line?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and his team left the museum, leaving Tom and the principal behind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

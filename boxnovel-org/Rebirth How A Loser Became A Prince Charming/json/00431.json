The juice ran down along his slender fingers as Qin Guan licked it.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue almost dropped the onion rings in her mouth.</p><br/><p>What will I do with this boy? He becomes a different person when he eats\u2026 It\u2019s so embarrassing!</p><br/><p>Before she could warn Qin Guan not to lose face in a foreign country, the Americans around them started talking.</p><br/><p>\"High-class restaurants are too far from the theater. We\u2019ll be too hungry by the time we get there. Shall we get a corn cake now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, just a snack.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, John! We can eat here instead of at the hotel!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's group was driven away by the sudden influx of customers.</p><br/><p>The Californian man was confused. His small van, which usually sold snacks to tourists, welcomed a group of film circle VIPs.</p><br/><p>\"Seafood corn cakes, takeaway...\"</p><br/><p>\"Traditional ones, eat in. And two cups of coffee...\"</p><br/><p>The reporters and onlookers silently took out their cameras and cell phones to take pictures of the handsome men and beautiful ladies as they passed by.</p><br/><p>The owner of the canteen got excited when he saw Jones, one of the top gourmet critics in the US. Wearing his signature black-framed glasses, he stood in front of the small van.</p><br/><p>\"A traditional cake, please.\"</p><br/><p>The owner tried to calm down. Delighted, he made the most perfect Mexican corn cake he had made in his life.</p><br/><p>Before he could come back to his senses, his lucky star, Qin Guan, had left with his friends.</p><br/><p>Another beautiful day dawned. It was the beginning of a new life.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw his friends off at the airport and returned to his everyday life again.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, this is Qu Xuemei. Come to my office. Now!\"</p><br/><p>She hung up without hesitation. This was just like her. You should wait for my answer next time. I have to finish my homework. I\u2019ve been away from campus for three days.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan decided to ignore the call, but his phone shook on the desk again. It was a message from Qu. Don\u2019t mess with me, or I\u2019ll come to your college.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan sighed. It seems like she really needs me.</p><br/><p>He put away his books and ran to the campus entrance with his car key. Chief Director Qu returns to VOGUE. My golden time is about to begin. My financial future will be taken care of soon.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't think Qu's call was a trick, even though she had sent him NYLON's address. Profit was more powerful than enemies. Maybe VOGUE and NYLON would be cooperating in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was in an optimistic mood when he reached the roof garden of the NYLON building.</p><br/><p>There was a large glass greenhouse there for planting flowers. The flowers were divided into four neat areas with clean paths between them.</p><br/><p>Outside the greenhouse were some strange facilities that looked like the buttons of an ancient typewriter. It was a combination of an iron frame and a round iron plate.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried to sit on it. It was firm, and the round plate could rotate along with his body.</p><br/><p>\"Your roof is very modern, Raynana. You could use it as a temporary grandstand. It's big enough for a small party. I like its modern style.\"</p><br/><p>Raynana smiled to herself. Qin Guan made a good point. He still knew nothing about their plans though.</p><br/><p>To ensure a fair play between the two models and the selection of the exclusive model of VOGUE, neither Chad nor Qin Guan had gotten a notice in advance. Qin Guan was assigned to an independent fitting room. The cabinet beside it was his dressing room.</p><br/><p>There was another fitting room next to it, which made Qin Guan realize that he had a partner. He went out of the dressing room in an Armani suit and saw his partner, Chad, talking nervously with Richard.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Come here!\" He looked back and saw Qu Xuemei.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Qu?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your task today is to crush Chad! Use all your power! Understand?\"</p><br/><p>\"But we have to cooperate with each other during the photoshoot...\" Qin Guan was confused by her demand. As the chief editor, she should be focusing on the effect of the photos. Why is she asking me to do the exact opposite?</p><br/><p>\"Stop that rubbish! Think of Chad as an ordinary model from China and do your best to crush him. Use all your skills during the photoshoot! Do not be considerate towards your partner. If he fails, it\u2019s his fault!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

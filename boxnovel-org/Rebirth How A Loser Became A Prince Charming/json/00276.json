He told the assistant director, \"It\u2019s only a supporting role with one line. Did he meet with the action director? Elegant movements are necessary. I just need the effect.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue smiled to herself. That\u2019s it! My boy has never failed a test like that.</p><br/><p>The producers were busy with work, so Qin Guan followed the assistant director to the studio.</p><br/><p>It was noisy inside. The crew shuttled among different places to shoot an outdoor scene. The scene, which took only 10 minutes, cost a lot.</p><br/><p>Knowing why they were there, the action director sized Qin Guan up from head to toe.</p><br/><p>Are you kidding? 90% of the film involves martial arts. This part, which took only five minutes to shoot, was not easy for anybody.</p><br/><p>The director fell into deep thought. He didn't want to insult the assistant director. I could just make things difficult for the actor.</p><br/><p>His attitude betrayed his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\"Have you acted in a martial arts film before?\" His nose was nearly pointing to the sky.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I have been on a wire.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\" He lowered his nose a little. He is not a green hand.</p><br/><p>\"So you\u2019re a Kung Fu expert?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, my master belonged to the ninth generation of Xingyi Fist.\"</p><br/><p>He was talking about Mou Xiaoliu. The girl had taught him a lot.</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\" The director looked at the slender, graceful young man. One should never judge others by their appearance.</p><br/><p>\"Show me.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! That\u2019s pretty good! What about weapons?\" The director looked intrigued as he handed Qin Guan a sword.</p><br/><p>Looking at the sword, Qin Guan murmured to himself, \"I can\u2019t do that.\"</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say that though. The blockbuster starred Kung Fu stars, including Li Lianjie and Zhen Zidan. Even the other actors, who were comparatively inferior, like Liang Chaowei and Zhang Manyu, were familiar with martial arts.</p><br/><p>The weakest one was Zhang Ziyi, who played a servant in the film. After the movie \"Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon\" though, she had grown up.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the only actor who would have to both perform martial art movements and deliver lines, so he was the weakest link. If he said the truth, he would be immediately replaced by another experienced actor.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gave his symbolic smile again, and Sister Xue realized he would be relying on his face again.</p><br/><p>He took the sword gently. It was a heavy one. He pressed two fingers against the blade and slowly wiped it till the end. The bronze black blade looked good against his fair, slender fingers.</p><br/><p>He tapped on the blade with his middle finger, making a handsome movement, and then returned it to the director.</p><br/><p>With a smile, he told the director, \"I have read the script. All the martial art movements were choreographed by your team. My shabby skills would be no match for them.\"</p><br/><p>\"I would like to act out your choreography. I think it must be perfect. May I have the honor of following your directions?\"</p><br/><p>The director felt flattered by his words. The audience only paid attention to actors and forgot about the crew working behind the scenes. They were the foundation of any success.</p><br/><p>Closing his eyes, he tried to recall the movements designed by his team. They were in his blood.</p><br/><p>Dust flew as the sword sparkled. The heavy sword looked splendid in his hand. Every detail was clear. Every movement was extraordinary.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed. He is the right man for the role.</p><br/><p>The director was done after a few minutes. He had enjoyed himself to the fullest. He handed the sword back to Qin Guan. \"Want to have a try? It seems simple, but you\u2019ll find it difficult when you practise. Your foundation is no-\"</p><br/><p>The words were choked in his throat.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had started dancing with the sword. He had taken off his coat and started performing the same movements the director had performed. Different people gave them a different vibe though.</p><br/><p> The director was as powerful as a general, while Qin Guan was as graceful and gentle as a scholar. It was the perfect combination of martial arts and dance. </p><br/><p>Shocked, the director stood still.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue smoothed her hair down proudly. My boy is inferior to nobody when it comes to learning!</p><br/><p>The crew had also noticed them. They had thought that the young man would embarrass himself before the director. Only when Qin Guan got on the stage did they realize what the word \"amazing\" truly meant. The sword was flying in the air in an ancient, poetic style.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She was too young to fool the three veterans.</p><br/><p>In the scene being shot, the man and the girl fell in love with each other. They were in the same cold metal city filled with armored concrete. The red wine, candles and flowers reflected their tender feelings though.</p><br/><p>Lifting their glasses, they looked at each other and toasted. It was a very romantic moment.</p><br/><p>Keeping up her sweetest smile, Kyoko looked like a lovesick girl, caught in Qin Guan's net of emotion and desire.</p><br/><p>She cast a glance in the direction of Cong Nianwei and then turned around. Suddenly, she leaned against Qin Guan's chest.</p><br/><p>They had already been close to each other, but now she threw herself in his embrace.</p><br/><p>\"Careful!\" Everyone reminded Qin Guan to support her. Only his friends folded their arms across their chests and snorted.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was about to hug Kyoko, when he saw the evil girl smile cunningly at him and try to hit him directly on the chest.</p><br/><p>It would be awkward if Qin Guan held her, as he would have to touch her somewhere. If he got out of the way though, he would be criticized. What should I do?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s brain worked fast and made a decision. The arrow on the string had to be fired.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch! I\u2019m falling!\"</p><br/><p>His dramatic acting convinced everyone. He fell down before Kyoko could hit him.</p><br/><p>Using the strong muscles on his waist, he leaned by more than 30 degrees. His arms moved to keep his balance as he shouted, \"Ah! Someone help me!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei burst into laughter, and Sister Xue covered her face helplessly. Kyoko was in trouble. She couldn\u2019t control her body like Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan disappeared, she couldn\u2019t hold her body back anymore and she fell forward.</p><br/><p>\"Bang!\" The cup in her hand flew in the air, and she fell on the floor face first.</p><br/><p>After some wobbling, Qin Guan straightened up again. With a horror-struck expression, he told his girlfriend, \"I got so scared!\"</p><br/><p>Liar! Before his friends and Sister Xue could cast disdainful glances at him, Yumiko rushed onto the set in a dramatic manner typical for Japanese people. She looked like she had just lost her mother in an accident.</p><br/><p>Kyoko was in a daze, not from her fall, but from Qin Guan\u2019s behavior.</p><br/><p>As a beautiful girl, she was used to being treated like a queen by men and boys. Qin Guan\u2019s behavior was a heavy blow for her. It hurt even more than her face.</p><br/><p>Yumiko pulled her up and supported her out of the set. She sat in the resting area and slowly arranged her thoughts.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei gave her the nearest table and sat with Lan Jin.</p><br/><p>Kyoko Fukada was supported to the table while Qin Guan listened to Sister Xue's rebuke. Kyoko looked at Qin Guan with a confused expression before she turned her eyes to the cup on the table.</p><br/><p>The water in the cup had cooled down, and a light pink lip print was visible on the cup.</p><br/><p>Grinding her teeth, Kyoko murmured to herself, \"I have never been this humiliated before. I just wanted to play a joke on the boy, because he already has a girlfriend. I should have been more serious though.\"</p><br/><p>Not long after, she apologized to everyone with a sweet smile, expressing her wish to continue the shooting. All the crew members let out a long breath.</p><br/><p>A crunched-up paper cup was lying silently in a trash can. On the rim of the cup, there was an indistinct trace of a pink lip gloss.</p><br/><p>To everyone's surprise, the rest of the work was finished smoothly. Kyoko Fukada worked extremely hard and the shooting ended early.</p><br/><p>The other photos were individual photos of Qin Guan. Kyoko's first job in China had come to an official end.</p><br/><p>In the following days, she would participate in a series of advertising activities in China to make the best of her exposure to Chinese media.</p><br/><p>Both Sister Xue and Qin Guan let out a long breath of relief. The princess is gone at last. Nobody can stand her.</p><br/><p>Kyoko Fukada bowed happily before the crew in farewell. Then she walked up to Qin Guan and his friends.</p><br/><p>\"I appreciate your help, Mr. Qin. Although you nearly fell down, you still tried to catch me. You are so kind!\"</p><br/><p>Are you messing with me, girl? I\u2019m not an idiot.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grimaced awkwardly, and Kyoko left satisfied. His three classmates sized her up from head to toe and reminded Qin Guan kindheartedly, \"This is not just any woman. She must be planning something.\"</p><br/><p>Guan Jian was a tough man though. He made fun of He Ming, \"You see plots everywhere. You saw two hens at your house once and you didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d be cooked for dinner!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone burst into laughter. They walked out of the Citizen building, fighting childishly. Suddenly, several men rushed out and stopped them.</p><br/><p>The boys clustered around Cong Nianwei unconsciously. She was the only girl among them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

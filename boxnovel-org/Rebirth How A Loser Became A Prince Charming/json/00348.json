She was Asian and she was wearing a black gauzy skirt that looked like an umbrella.</p><br/><p> \"Yamaguchi Tsutomu?\"</p><br/><p> \"Yamaguchi Tsutomu?\"</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao and Qin Guan called her name out together in one voice.</p><br/><p> \"How do you know her?\"</p><br/><p> Xu looked at Qin Guan in surprise. Unconsciously, he said, \"\u00a3$^%*^*&amp;^&amp;?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan swallowed a shrimp. \"What are you talking about? Can you speak like a normal human being? Or were you rendered speechless by that beautiful girl? Beauties of her kind are rare in the US.\"</p><br/><p> Xu let out a breath at Qin Guan's ignorance on argot. Then he patted Qin Guan on the shoulder. \"Just enjoy your food. You can leave any time you like. Just tell me in advance.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan nodded in confusion. Xu let the hot girl go and walked up to Yamaguchi Tsutomu.</p><br/><p> Yamaguchi Tsutomu had been looking around blankly until Xu approached her. Then she noticed Qin Guan behind him.</p><br/><p> She had been looking for him for a long time. Looking back, she saw Qin Guan sitting there eating meat...</p><br/><p> She bowed in his direction. The big man next to her, who was her loyal servant, had also met Qin Guan in Shinjuku. The honest man bowed before Qin Guan silently.</p><br/><p> \"My distinguished guest, shall we talk downstairs?\"</p><br/><p> Xu didn't want to attract other people\u2019s attention. He gestured to Yamaguchi Tsutomu and they headed downstairs.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was nearly full. He set his plate down on the table and turned around to leave. I\u2019ve met so many acquaintances at this party! I better go home now.</p><br/><p> He sent a message to Xu and left the noisy party unhurriedly.</p><br/><p> He idled on the quiet road in his Burberry formal wear, humming a song. His house was close by, just a couple of blocks away, but he hesitated on the crossroads. The road on the left led to a black neighborhood.</p><br/><p> The road on the right would take him an extra 10 minutes.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was a brave man, so he wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. The black neighborhood is no hell. I\u2019ll take the road on the right though.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan chose the longer way without hesitation. It was a wise choice.</p><br/><p> Experienced robbers were the most difficult to deal with. Those smart guys waited there to find more victims.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's wise choice didn't help him though. He was surrounded in no time, with no way to escape.</p><br/><p> There were three unarmed criminals around him. Qin Guan thought of all the skills he had been gifted with and chose one in hopes of shocking them.</p><br/><p> He shouted like Bruce Lee in his fine black clothes, and then he span around and performed a side kick.</p><br/><p> He followed up with a handspring, a handspring front tuck and a somersault. Finally, he took a stage pose and ended his performance.</p><br/><p> He beckoned arrogantly at the black men. \"All men are brothers. Gentlemen fight fair! One on one, come on!\"</p><br/><p> His floor exercises had landed him out of their ring of encirclement. The three robbers were right across from him. </p><br/><p> \"Bro, he seems fierce. Who should go first?\"</p><br/><p> The leader knocked the other man on the head. \"You idiot! We are robbers, not martial artists! Don't listen to him. We all attack together!\"</p><br/><p> They all approached Qin Guan. The closer they got to him, the more surprised they looked.</p><br/><p> That Asian boy seems like a real martial artist!</p><br/><p> To be on the safe side and ensure their success, their leader murmured, \"Weapons...\"</p><br/><p> He seemed cautious, which was wise of him. Qin Guan\u2019s outfit could be sold for thousands of dollars at a second-hand designer shop. He was also wearing a diamond watch and sapphire sleeve buttons.</p><br/><p> In fact, Qin Guan looked like a real nouveau riche. It was a pity that he hadn\u2019t taken his wallet with him.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan realized that his pose was useless. He was still trying to think of a plan when the three guys took their knives out.</p><br/><p> They were flick knives, as long as a grown man\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p> According to Qin Guan's estimation, they could make a big hole in his body. He was not frightened though. When facing beasts, one had to be brave.</p><br/><p> \"Come on!\" he shouted loudly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Amid the sound of the Fate Symphony, he turned the steering wheel in a restrained way.</p><br/><p>It was just the first turn, but the people in the car seemed to be flying up in the sky. Qin Guan moved his shoulders slightly, his arms stretching and relaxing.</p><br/><p>The cameraman dared not cry out, but he was weeping silently. Qin Guan opened his mouth wider and wider, until he was laughing happily.</p><br/><p>He sped up on the rugged road. Not long afterwards, the road started gradually becoming even. Qin Guan\u2019s view was broader now, indicating that they had left behind the most dangerous part of the road.</p><br/><p>The beach was flat, the setting sun drooping over it. Its orange light brought the sea and the sky together as the waves sparkled.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stomped on the brakes and turned the steering wheel to take a last leap. After a beautiful turn, the silver car used the force of friction to stop on the beach. Qin Guan looked out front and took a perfect pose.</p><br/><p>As soon as the car stopped, the cameraman unfastened his seatbelt and got out. After taking a few steps, he threw up, shocking the crew.</p><br/><p>\"What about you? Are you okay?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shut the door and ran up to the gentle young man, feeling a little guilty.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s check the playback. Quick!\"</p><br/><p>The director waved at his crew. Before leaving, he patted Qin Guan on the back. \"Good job!\"</p><br/><p>He walked dizzily back to the car, praying silently. Please! The shooting must go on! Please! I\u2019ll never drive with that angelic-looking monster again!</p><br/><p>Everyone gathered to watch the playback on a laptop. The exterior of the car looked perfect. Even the tire tracks on the road were clear. The interior of the car looked just as good. The texture of the leather seats made it look like an oil painting.</p><br/><p>The lips, eyes, beautiful wrist watch, elegant movements and splendid smile of the model were perfect, and so was his last pose. Every shot was like a picture telling the story of a talented young man.</p><br/><p>\"Perfect!\" Everyone started cheering after watching the film. Few advertisement actors could do this in one shot, let alone give such a wonderful performance.</p><br/><p>The director of Cadillac was shaking hands warmly with Qin Guan, who was about to leave. Qin Guan had saved them a lot of money.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was waiting for him under the sunset, wearing a big straw hat. Qu cast a supercilious look at Qin Guan behind her sunglasses. After working hard, Qin Guan needed some food to reward himself.</p><br/><p>Qu became the shameless third wheel, grinding her teeth as she followed the lovers. Looking at the map, they found their next destination: HOUSTON.</p><br/><p>HOUSTON was a chain restaurant famous for its various American dishes. Its delicious food made it popular among the locals in California.</p><br/><p>A waiter led them to their reserved seats. The open kitchen was just across from them. There were no partitions, so every customer could see the chefs at work.</p><br/><p>They seated themselves and realized none of the patrons were focused on their food. None, but a blonde lady at a table on the left side of the restaurant. She had thick lips and a straight nose. Her mysterious deep blue eyes were her most charming feature.</p><br/><p>As insiders of the fashion circle, Qin Guan and Qu recognized the girl at once. It was Paris Whitney Hilton, one of the heirs of the Hilton family. She was a frequent guest at Hollywood fashion events, but she was more famous for her romantic affairs than her work.</p><br/><p>Well-behaved actors considered her a troublemaker.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a look at the window and saw some reporters outside, taking pictures of the controversial star and trying to guess why she was in the restaurant.</p><br/><p>\"Look at all those reporters, Qin Guan! Will there be any trouble?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry. They will behave. They won\u2019t dare enter the restaurant.\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s not what I meant. If they saw you, wouldn\u2019t they fabricate more stories?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan paused before smiling again. \"Impossible! They have no time to look at me. Paris Hilton is over there!\"</p><br/><p>The waiter served them their steaks.</p><br/><p>There was a whole rare ribeye on each plate. Juices were dripping out, mixed with a little blood. The meat was so tender, it melted in their mouths. The salty mashed potato and parsley dressing increased their appetite even more.</p><br/><p>There was also a unique sauce and pepper powder produced by the restaurant.</p><br/><p>The feast was a big surprise for everyone. The prices were also reasonable, which was why the place was so popular. The average was about 40 dollars each.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

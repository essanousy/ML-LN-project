When they had the material they wanted, they let Qin Guan go. The next celebrity of the fashion circle was just entering the hall.</p><br/><p>It was Fang Meiya and her new sweetheart, Chang Jin, the current Mr. Singapore. Gossip for media was just like a carrion for flies. All the cameras turned around.</p><br/><p>Beautiful ladies and handsome men were always the centre of the conversation, even more so a beautiful woman famous for her love life.</p><br/><p>As he waited outside, Shao Xiaobing\u2019s agent nearly pulled all his hair off. How did the organizer arrange that order of appearance?</p><br/><p>As the winner, Qin Guan was naturally the first to enter. Because of her status and name, Fang was a good choice to enter second.</p><br/><p>You should have put some guests between Fang and Shao to avoid any awkwardness! What were you thinking? Are you using my model to arouse gossip and attract public attention? This is an insult to us! Shao is considered a first-level model in Asia.</p><br/><p>Shao stopped his agent and calmly arranged his suit. He looked slender in his Issey Miyake.</p><br/><p>\"This is a most welcome opportunity for me. This way, everyone can compare Chang to me. I\u2019m the better one for Fang Meiya.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you still miss her?\" his agent asked him worriedly.</p><br/><p>Shao\u2019s face stiffened, but didn't betray his emotions. \"Impossible! No one can fall in love with a brick wall.\"</p><br/><p>His agent was not as optimistic. Shao had not been in a good mood ever since they had broken up. His agent remained silent though, respecting Shao's privacy.</p><br/><p>I hope he can forget her. She does not deserve his love.</p><br/><p>By then, Fang and Chang were standing before the board hand in hand. All the cameras were around them, wasting film like crazy. They smiled brightly in their matching outfits.</p><br/><p>Then they saw the third guest walk up to them slowly.</p><br/><p>He was half a minute earlier than the arranged time. The two lovers were still standing on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>The reporters cheered up at the hope of big gossip.</p><br/><p>Shao was wearing a white formal outfit and smiling gently, creating a sharp contrast against Chang Jin\u2019s dark skin and orange outfit.</p><br/><p>Stunned, Fang and Chang pasted smiles on their faces again. They followed the staff and left. Before entering the hall, Chang looked back at Shao with a meaningful expression.</p><br/><p>He is good at getting publicity, but he\u2019s still a loser.</p><br/><p>Fang didn't care about the episode. She was not that interested in public attention.</p><br/><p>Before the dull award ceremony, all the sponsors, including many famous designers and brands from Asia, would present their spring collections to the audience. Taking that chance, the insiders of the fashion circle and the media would get a general idea about the latest trends.</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing was an exception. Thanks to Fang Meiya\u2019s affinity and his second place in the competition, he had gotten a chance to walk on the red carpet. The other candidates were not as lucky as him.</p><br/><p>As the last one to arrive, he attracted a lot of attention. Among all the losers, he was the only one to have that honor, which made the others unhappy.</p><br/><p>The crowded backstage fell silent when he entered, which was a similar situation to the one Qin Guan had experienced several years earlier.</p><br/><p>In his personal dressing room, Qin Guan changed into his outfit for the opening show.</p><br/><p>It was a loose gown made of wool and cotton, something popular in Asia at the time. Matched with pants of the same material, it looked like a cassock for ordinary people.</p><br/><p>Those outfits were only for show, not for sale. Qin Guan had qualified for one thanks to his figure and status.</p><br/><p> He went out of the dressing room and noticed the awkward atmosphere backstage. Shao had already left to change clothes. Qin Guan saw that the models with different dressing styles were in different groups.</p><br/><p>As top models in their own countries, they were all professionals. The models in avant-garde costumes of famous designers were standing in sequence behind Qin Guan. There was a designer logo on their bare skin, looking gorgeous on their arms or foreheads.</p><br/><p>The other group would be exhibiting garments. They were the exclusive models of different brands, except Issey Miyake, which Qin Guan would be wearing last. They would be showing the rest of the spring collections to the audience.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

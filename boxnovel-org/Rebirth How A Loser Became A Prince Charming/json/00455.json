Offices in this area are very popular, but only old firms can afford such large offices. You are still young. You should rethink that high price.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by the kind-hearted real estate agent. Men like him were rare in such a materialistic society.</p><br/><p>\"It's not expensive, I can afford it. I thought the rent was 110,000 dollars a month, which would mean that I\u2019d have to expand my business really fast. But 110,000 a year is a great price. My firm can afford it. Thank you for your advice though.\"</p><br/><p>Smith was shocked. \"How old are you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Twenty two. No, actually twenty one. My birthday is soon.\"</p><br/><p> \"Are you a graduate student?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, I\u2019m still in college.\"</p><br/><p>As the best salesman of his previous agency, Smith always accepted a challenge. Actually, if he had been a senior manager in New York, he would not have been impressed by the young man. Talented boys were common on Wall Street.</p><br/><p>A rising index could make people millionaires, and a change of policy could turn tycoons into beggars. Smith had just arrived in New York from Texas though, so he still felt like a peasant in the bustling metropolis.</p><br/><p>The QC firm offices had been decided.</p><br/><p>WeWork would take care of the following procedures. Qin Guan had trusted Cong Nianwei with the decoration. Cong Nianwei had made great achievements in the design and construction of small houses, as well as their gallery and designing studio. Couples were always good at doing business together.</p><br/><p>Lately, Qin Guan had deliberately prevented Cong Nianwei from going out though. She had a lot of work to do, so she would stay at college or at home for several weeks. This was because of all the panic that had spread all over the US after May.</p><br/><p>War had broken out in Iraq in March. Originally, everyone had thought that it was only a verbal battle between politicians. It was supposed to be a united action of UN, but most soldiers sent to the battlefield were Americans.</p><br/><p>Even during the Oscar ceremony, there had been many speeches filled with anger made by people who were involved in relative industries.</p><br/><p>Anti-war marches were taking place all over the country. The upcoming Memorial Day was also reminding people of the sorrow caused by war.</p><br/><p>Several people were standing at a window for veteran benefits in the City Hall, while a crowd also gathered outside. Some anti-war groups were standing there with posters and banners with phrases like \"No War\" and \"Stop That Foolish War\".</p><br/><p>The semi-finished floats made for Memorial Day passed by them slowly, adding a sarcastic vibe to the scene. Franklin went out of the City Hall with a blank expression. He was wearing camouflage clothing, which indicated his identity as a soldier. If it wasn\u2019t for his empty sleeve, he would have been considered a handsome man .</p><br/><p>War was cruel though. Franklin went out with his pension in his backpack. The money was not enough to last him for the rest of his life. The crowd reminded him of something as he squeezed out through it.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>It was another uneventful evening in New York. As usual, Qin Guan was looking at the backyard from the kitchen. No uninvited neighbors yet. The evening was perfect.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the sound of glass breaking was heard on the quiet street. Joseph looked out of the window and shouted, \"F*ck!\"</p><br/><p>The window of the grocery store at the corner of the street had been smashed. Some black men had broken in, searching for anything valuable.</p><br/><p>\"Are they crazy? How dare they commit a robbery here! The police will come immediately!\"</p><br/><p>They rushed to the window, watching the process and talking about it.</p><br/><p>\"Shall we call the police?\"</p><br/><p>Beep... Before his voice could fade away, the alarm started ringing. Suddenly, they saw the owner rushing out of his house with a gun.</p><br/><p> \"You bastards!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The black men escaped with the cash register money. The fat owner ran after them. After a few meters, he gave up.</p><br/><p>\"My store!\" he cried out at the entrance. \"That f*cking police! I\u2019ll file a complaint! Honest taxpayers are paying those f*cking shits!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt strange as he watched the owner cry.</p><br/><p>\"Under normal circumstances, a car alarm would have attracted patrol cruisers in three minutes. Why has nobody come by now?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

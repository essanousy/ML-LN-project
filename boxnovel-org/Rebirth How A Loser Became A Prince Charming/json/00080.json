As he joked around with them, Qin Guan was surprised to find out that the troublesome Ouyang Fen was only 16 years old.</p><br/><p>He was three years younger than him. As he thought of his resolute, serious face, his 184 centimeters and his broad chest, Qin Guan couldn't help but laugh loudly. That's what we called contrast-cute in my past life!</p><br/><p>The others didn't understand what Qin Guan was laughing about. Doesn't he look ridiculous for his age? Ouyang Fen's blank expression made him look like a war hero.</p><br/><p>The organizing committee handed out notices to the group leaders of every area, who would be in charge of informing the contestants about the results. (Actually, they had to avoid being beaten by the contestants. The task of informing was often offensive.)</p><br/><p>The person in charge of the capital looked at the notices. 30 persons would be selected from 190 contestants, so there would be an average of two finalists from every area.</p><br/><p>That's pretty good. There are two contestants selected from my area. As expected, it's the winner and the runner-up. He handed the notices to them first.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue waved the notice proudly at Ou Qiang. Her IQ had dropped from hanging out with those silly guys for so long.</p><br/><p>The final of the New Face Model Competition would take place on August 28. Qin Guan let out a long breath. That would be the final kick at the goal line. This arduous competition has cost me more than half a year!</p><br/><p>Sister Xue smiled to herself as she saw Qin Guan off. Finally, I've gotten the child on board. This is actually a short competition. There will be more time-consuming activities in the future. I\u2019ll force him to go at knife-point if I have to.</p><br/><p>What a ferocious woman!</p><br/><p>The autumn sky was clear, and the air was crisp. It was still dry and hot in the capital, and that's how it was like in the waiting area of the national final site as well. After an assembled training by the organizing committee, most of the contestants had mastered the basic process of the competition.</p><br/><p>The first round of the national final was a group performance. The boys and the girls would be standing at two different places, and they would get on the stage together to demonstrate the theme of the final: Autumn.</p><br/><p>The lights dimmed, and the colorful lamps on the stage were lit one after the other. The digital video started playing as the host stomped on the white smoke created by dry ice and walked to the front of the stage to announce the start of the national final.</p><br/><p>The curtain rose, and 30 beautiful models filed out, walking on the stage one after the other. They were wearing new autumn outfits designed by Xie Feng, who was one of the judges.</p><br/><p>Pairs of legs along with wheat ears, chilli and garlic (how did they get that in?) praised the pregnant autumn. Xie Feng nodded again and again off stage. The new models this year are of a much higher level compared to previous years. It seems like the Chinese fashion industry is being embraced throughout the country.</p><br/><p>The models went around and formed a line again. They took a pose, pressing on their waists, holding their abs and exposing their legs. The advantage of the pose was that it showed everyone the size of their waists and the length of their legs. The difference was clear at first sight.</p><br/><p>The girls got off the stage. While the male models got ready, the host introduced the concept of the autumn collection to create the right atmosphere and allow time for the judges to grade the female models.</p><br/><p>When the male models got on the stage, everyone was shocked by the advanced designs of the rising designer. The colors of the outfits were in sharp contrast, and the wheat around the bottom of the pant legs reminded the audience of nature.</p><br/><p>Special oil had been applied to the models' muscles to make their skin look like copper and their lines seem smoother. It was time to judge their bodies. The judges examined their figures and grade them silently before the models retreated backstage.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue pulled Qin Guan over and pushed him toward the bathroom, urging him, \"Quick, take a shower! Clean yourself all over. Understand?\" Then she handed him a professional oil brush. \"Ou Qiang is holding up two sprayers for you and Ouyang Fen. Be fast, or you\u2019ll be late!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went inside, looking at the brush as he took off his clothes. \"Shall I use it to brush someone else's back? But whose? Surely not Ou Qiang's? Obviously, it's for him!\"</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan entered the simple bathroom, he found Ouyang Fen taking an uncomfortable shower under a sprayer. A small pink brush was in his hand, the same brush as the blue one in Qin Guan's hand. When Ou Qiang saw Qin Guan, he shouted at him happily, \"Hey, this sprayer is for you! I\u2019ll go find my baby Xue. You two have a nice shower...\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>The two of them faced each other in silence, washing the oil off their bodies. More and more people started entering the bathroom, which made them feel better. They didn\u2019t know how to talk with someone hostile. Ouyang Fen seemed lost in thought as he stared at the pink brush in his hand.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan decided to be magnanimous. He was older than Ouyang Fen by three years after all. Waving the blue brush, he said, \"You don\u2019t like the pink one? I can brush your back with the blue one if you want.\"</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen nodded unconsciously and turned around. I\u2019ll be late for the next show.</p><br/><p>Using the skills he had learned from his father, Qin Guan brushed Ouyang Fen's back quickly and turned his own back to him. Ouyang Fen seemed to be admiring him.</p><br/><p>He felt the first brush. \"F*ck, that hurts!\" Qin Guan shouted, jumping away. Is he taking advantage of this to get back at me? I shouldn\u2019t have been kind to him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Qin Guan and Xu overheard their words. As a polite Chinese guy, Qin Guan turned around and greeted them with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\"</p><br/><p>His smile shocked them. They had originally thought that models on TV were made to look better through makeup, costumes and photoshop, but the ordinary boy standing in front of them was much prettier than the one they had seen on screen.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around to push the wagon, when a pair of arms suddenly locked around his legs.</p><br/><p>\"Are you the prince from \u2018Snow White\u2019? I want to see the dragon!\"</p><br/><p>Dear, you have mixed up two different tales. There is no dragon in \"Snow White\"! If there was, the princess would have died along with the prince.</p><br/><p>The blond kid with the sparkling blue eyes seemed really happy to meet a prince in real life. Before his elder brother could greet Qin Guan, he was already there.</p><br/><p> I want to hug his legs too!</p><br/><p>The whole family gathered around them.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? Are you the hero from \u2018Confessions of a Dangerous Mind?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Great! The trip here was definitely worth it. Come take a picture with us! We could show this to our neighbors!\"</p><br/><p>\"Good idea! They will be really jealous!\"</p><br/><p>They all acted fast. The kid climbed up Qin Guan's legs till it reached his chest. He would certainly grow into a good rock-climber in the future.</p><br/><p>Everyone smiled wide at the camera as they stood around Qin Guan. Poor Xu Xiaoxiao had failed to get in the picture. He had stayed by the wagon to take care of their luggage.</p><br/><p>The strange family attracted public attention. Why aren\u2019t they taking pictures of the campus, the sculptures, or the athletes on the field? Who is that student?</p><br/><p>Everyone fixed their eyes on the young man surrounded by the family.</p><br/><p>\"Darling, doesn\u2019t that boy look familiar?\"</p><br/><p>\"There must be something wrong with my eyes. He looks like that model from the Armani advertisement!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh my! Is there a celebrity studying at Columbia?\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall we take a look?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\"</p><br/><p>People started gathering around them. In one minute, Qin Guan was surrounded by curious freshmen and their parents, who thought he was some kind of campus landmark. Everybody wanted to take a picture with him.</p><br/><p>Timmy and his family squeezed out of the crowd and left with Xu, who was pulling the wagon alone with all his might.</p><br/><p>The college authorities took advantage of the event. No one knew when it happened, but suddenly an emergency medicine distribution post, a guidepost and several maps had been placed next to Qin Guan. He was treated as a temporary landmark of the university.</p><br/><p>Vivian set up a flag of his fan club in the ground behind him.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was laughing at him. If somebody put a small tin can by his feet, people would think he was a monkey in a zoo. People were usually charged for taking pictures with animals.</p><br/><p>When it was time for lunch, everyone started leaving. Cong Nianwei stood up from the grass and patted Qin Guan on the shoulder. He looked almost stupefied.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go to your professor\u2019s office and say hi. There is no one around. Don't forget, you need to ask for leave at the beginning of the new semester.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to his senses and turned around like a robot.</p><br/><p>\"Help me, Wei. I can\u2019t move!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone had tried their best to hug Qin Guan while they had been taking pictures. Some girls had even taken advantage of him. Qin Guan felt as tired as if he had just finished 10 Fashion Week runway shows.</p><br/><p>\"Can you massage my back? It hurts...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

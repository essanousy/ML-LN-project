Of course, the more admissions the better, but that was easier said than done. It was difficult to organize an international activity. If the participants didn\u2019t control themselves, they would be too busy to finish the job.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was nervous as he listened to the director\u2019s instructions. Every step of the process required the cooperation of all parties. They had to rehearse in advance.</p><br/><p>Soon, Qin Guan had a general idea about the autographed copy sale. Citizen basically wanted to promote the opening ceremony of its largest store in Asia.</p><br/><p>First, they would cut the ribbon, and then the copy sale would be held. Finally, a small-scale meeting would be held in the back hall to greet fans from different countries.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would interact with fans for 10 to 20 minutes. To avoid an emergency, the participants would be limited to 100, half of whom would be Chinese.</p><br/><p>Foreigners were complaining that the Chinese fans took up too many admission spots, but they had no idea how many domestic fans Qin Guan had.</p><br/><p>His first fan was a girl named Huang Jiajia.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia had still not given up hope. She followed Qin Guan everywhere on campus, peeping at him tearfully. Her pride prevented her from moving closer to him, but it still couldn't stop her lingering affection.</p><br/><p>Naturally, she had bought plenty of the albums, so she was one of the 50 lucky fans.</p><br/><p>Excited, Huang Jiajia had uploaded the card on the college forum to show off to the other girls. She had underestimated the power of internet and gossip though. The picture was quickly uploaded on the Haijiao Forum, the headquarters of Qin Guan's fans.</p><br/><p>A stone could stir a thousand waves.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who had never been involved in entertainment programs, specials or news, or had an affair with another actress, would have an autographed copy sale?</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t believe it. This would be their only chance to see the real Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a post about the album was made on the Haijiao Forum. All the details, including the distribution number, issuing country, participation conditions, signing process, and fan ratio were clearly stated.</p><br/><p>It seemed like a report from Citizen and the magazine staff.</p><br/><p>Countless fans regretted not buying the album. They expressed their feelings in articles on the internet.</p><br/><p>\"His album had only been two stands away from me, but I hesitated. It\u2019s too late now.\"</p><br/><p>Someone replied to the post with an even sadder story.</p><br/><p>\"At least you saw the album. I didn't even cast a glance at it. The newsstand owner had covered it with a VOGUE! Later, I found out that he had been saving it for some fans who had paid him 70 yuan for it.\"</p><br/><p>Readers began sharing their sad stories with each other. The saddest story was about a girl who had bought the album, but forgotten to send the card!</p><br/><p>Of course, the unlucky fans who hadn\u2019t been selected in the lottery were the gloomiest.</p><br/><p>The outcome couldn't be changed though, so rich fans put their wits to work. There was a black market, where some fans sold their albums and admissions spots.</p><br/><p>As the date was drawing near, the Citizen director realized that the fan list had changed. The number was the same though, so everything else was mere details.</p><br/><p>It was the first day of December, and people\u2019s breaths were fogging the air. A group of people were waiting by the entrance of the Hengji Plaza early in the morning.</p><br/><p>The security guard was left speechless by the girls, who were wearing very few clothes in the cold winter. He tried to talk to them kindly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

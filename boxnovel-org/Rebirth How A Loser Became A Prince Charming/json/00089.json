With the help of their temporary riding tutors, the four models pulled their horses to the track slowly.</p><br/><p>Calling it a track was an exaggeration. It was basically an unsurfaced road created by local riders.</p><br/><p>In 1999, horsemanship was still foreign to the Chinese. It was only a luxury for rich men. The horsemanship competition was actually an attempt by the Bashang Grassland to promote its tourism. Domestic horses, Chinese scenery, local riders and international rules constituted the international horsemanship endurance competition.</p><br/><p>As a noble, natural, amusing sport, horsemanship was a combination of competitive sports, outdoor tourism, high-end social communication, pet feeding and stimulating decompression. Therefore, it didn't seem likely to fail to become popular.</p><br/><p>The committee of the competition had invited most of the local riders, eager to hold the grand event. The riders had all grown up on horseback, so the competition level had improved greatly. Baiyin and Buhe were among the best riders and contestants.</p><br/><p>Baiyin patted his horse on its back and asked it to stand still before he began the lesson.</p><br/><p>\"Check the horses\u2019 harnesses before mounting them, in case the saddle moves around. Then put the pedals down and adjust them to the right length. Make the saddle wings even.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t touch the horse\u2019s body when you put down the pedals. Just loosen your grip gently and let them hang down beside its ribs.\"</p><br/><p>Baiyin gently pulled his pedals down. His students followed his movements with their eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Stand near your horse\u2019s forelegs and make sure both reins have the same length. The inner side of the reins should be pasted to the horse\u2019s neck, and the stiff bit should touch the corner of its mouth gently. Hold the reins with your left hand and insert your index finger between them to grasp the horse\u2019s hair and the whip.\"</p><br/><p>\"Turn your pedals clockwise with your right hand until the outside faces you. Then push on the pedal inwards to mount the horse.\" He lifted his left leg to push on one pedal.</p><br/><p>\"Be careful! The next step is essential! Don\u2019t touch the horse\u2019s body. Instead, hold the right side of the saddle bridge with your right hand. Your left tiptoe should be under the belly band. Push against the ground with your right foot and jump up gently,\" he said as he jumped up to mount the horse\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>His students were listening to him carefully. Baiyin got on the horse easily, comforting the nervous young men.</p><br/><p>\"It seems simple.\" They all let out a relieved breath. Qin Guan memorized what Baiyin had said carefully with both his brain and muscles.</p><br/><p>As he rode on the horse, Baiyin taught them how to maintain a sitting posture while running. When he saw everyone nod in understanding, he asked them to have a try themselves with his and Buhe's help.</p><br/><p>The girls went first. Sister Xue just watched, secretly handing Qin Guan a green apple.</p><br/><p>\"I heard that one has to have good relationship with his horse. You have to wash them, clean their barn, or feed them. The first two will not do for you, so I brought their favorite food.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked down at the withered apple speechlessly. Are you kidding? My horse seems like a good boy. It doesn't need to be bribed.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue warned him, \"Look, it's showing the whites of its eyes to you!\" Qin Guan turned to his horse, who was staring at him with a disparaging expression as it moved its thick lips.</p><br/><p>You silly newbie. You want to ride on my head? I\u2019ll teach you a lesson!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan decided to compromise and take the apple. \"Fine, I\u2019ll have a try.\" When he presented the apple to the horse, the animal looked down at it. Oh, an apple? I like those.</p><br/><p>He swallowed the apple, leaving a handful of saliva on Qin Guan's hand.</p><br/><p>You cheated me! Is this what you call an apple? You dare try to manipulate me?</p><br/><p>Broken pieces of apple landed on Qin Guan's head as he was wiping the saliva on his pants. The apple had worsened their bilateral relationship.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could do anything, Buhe shouted, \"Young men, get on your horses!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and the second runner-up of the competition got on their horses at his command. Buhe frowned at the second runner-up, who was not paying attention to detail.</p><br/><p>Then he turned to Qin Guan. Well done! His posture is standard. Before he could praise Qin Guan though, Buhe realized something was wrong. Who assigned these horses to them? Who brought out the Troublemaker? As rookies, they should be riding tame old horses.</p><br/><p>The person in charge was innocent. He had seen a noble, handsome young man and unconsciously given him the most handsome horse. The Troublemaker was the most handsome horse in the barn. He had smooth black hair and strong muscles, and he was very elegant.</p><br/><p>However, he was a naughty horse. His favorite activity was making fun of strangers. There was no time for Buhe to warn Qin Guan. The Troublemaker was already moving.</p><br/><p>Holding his proud head high and shaking its beautiful mane, he let out a long happy sound that could be interpreted as, \"Ha ha, you are on my back! Come play with me now!\"</p><br/><p>The Troublemaker rushed to the track, leaving everyone screaming behind him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

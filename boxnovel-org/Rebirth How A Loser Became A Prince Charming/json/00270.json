Taking a deep breath, he said in a deep voice, \"There is a long road before you. Treat your feelings carefully.\"</p><br/><p>Only Huang Jiajia understood. Smiling, she said, \"My love for you is my business.\"</p><br/><p>Guo interpreted her words into various languages.</p><br/><p>Although confused, the rest of the fans shouted together, \"We\u2019ll love you forever, Qin Guan! Until the end of the world!\"</p><br/><p>The meeting ended in harmony.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left the hall and headed immediately for the J Clothing store, where patient fans had been waiting for him for one hour.</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan's official schedule was over. According to tradition, he could just leave the plaza without paying attention to the others.</p><br/><p>He felt it was necessary to meet them though, as Sister Xue had promised them he would.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan showed up at the entrance of the store, the fans shopping in the plaza rushed back in at once.</p><br/><p>They had just tried their luck by going there. Little had they known that there would be a surprise.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue spoke first.</p><br/><p>\"We are shocked to see fans come from such remote places for Qin Guan, a green hand in the circle. However, we do not want to see you trouble others by chasing after your idol. Think of the outcome. Who will take the pressure of public opinion? Qin Guan! Your favorite idol. Do you want to let him take the blame?\"</p><br/><p>Despite their young age, Qin Guan\u2019s fans were all reasonable girls. They reconsidered their behavior and felt sorry for it. They had actually forced Qin Guan and Citizen\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue continued her speech, \"It\u2019s our fault. Qin Guan seldom organizes events for fans, even ordinary publicity events. From now on, we\u2019ll make up for that. We\u2019ll set up a fan club! Thanks to your persistence, you will be the first group of members!\"</p><br/><p>The crowd was over the moon! The fans who had gotten official invitations rushed over.</p><br/><p>\"We were the first group of fans! We\u2019ll join the club!\"</p><br/><p>\"We founded a fan club in Japan the day after the album was released.\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the noisy girls, Qin Guan felt warm in the early winter.</p><br/><p>The manager of J Clothing led the fans to the square for a group photo as the boss listened to the report from the Hengji Plaza store.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, the sales volume this morning was as much as the whole week\u2019s. I handed the catalogues out and they bought Qin Guan\u2019s clothes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Most of them were girls. What about the women\u2019s clothes sales?\"</p><br/><p>\"They were pretty good. Besides, some media invited by Citizen took photos of our store. We\u2019ll be famous!\"</p><br/><p>The boss shook his head. \"I knew Qin Guan was my lucky star.\"</p><br/><p>He was quite right. Taking advantage of LEE, J Clothing had added women\u2019s clothes to its collection. By taking advantage of Citizen, the boss set his eyes on the Capital Fashion Week.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about his ambitions, but the boss would become his most faithful supporter in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was standing on the Hengji Plaza square. More than 100 fans had clustered around him to take the group photo.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was smiling in the centre. Huang Jiajia and Mou were on either side of him, acting like his bodyguards. Before the photographer pressed the button, Huang Jiajia grabbed Qin Guan\u2019s arm and Mou retreated.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s body was stiff when she released his arm.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia murmured, \"You\u2019re still so shy after two years. I have grown up. I like you. Deal with it!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't look back. Following the Citizen staff, he left the plaza.</p><br/><p>The senior committee of his fan club was officially formed. It was a well-organized group that behaved themselves. All the fans waved goodbye at Qin Guan warmly.</p><br/><p>They didn't forget to leave gifts to Qin Guan's agent and assistant.</p><br/><p>That day, Qin Guan\u2019s fan club was born. It would soon spread to different countries. There were capable fans everywhere. Soon after Qin Guan left, some fans began to collect basic materials.</p><br/><p>On their way to the company, Sister Xue waved her phone at Qin Guan proudly. \"See? I have all their numbers. When you have an event again, it will be a good resource for publicity.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She spotted Qin Guan right away.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan!\" she screamed and rushed up to him with her backpack.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, may I have your autograph?\" She took a pen out of her backpack. Qin Guan had been through this before. He just smiled and took the pen.</p><br/><p>\"Where?\"</p><br/><p>\"Here!\"</p><br/><p>The girl pointed to her chest. \"On my shirt, so that your signature will lie against my beating heart.\"</p><br/><p>She was really obsessed with Qin Guan. After she got the signature, she stuffed her thumb into her mouth and started biting her nails. What should I do now? Should I let him go or kiss him?</p><br/><p>As she was absorbed into her happy thoughts, a horrible urgent voice was suddenly heard from the building. \"Rosalie, what are you doing there? Come here! Come home with me!\"</p><br/><p>It was actually the old policeman. He fixed his eyes on Qin Guan's back with the thought of shooting him.</p><br/><p>That Asian magician has made my daughter fall in love with him! There are posters of him everywhere at home! She even organized her classmates so they could steal posters from stores and shopping malls!</p><br/><p>As a policeman, all he could do was help his daughter.</p><br/><p>The girl waved at her father and then rushed over to Qin Guan and kissed him on the jaw. She had aimed higher, but he was a lot taller than her.</p><br/><p>The roar of the policeman echoed through the whole parking lot. Feeling guilty, Qin Guan and the other bystanders ran to their cars as soon as possible and left the crime scene fast. The upset man felt the desire to shoot them. Curses were heard from afar.</p><br/><p>\"Wait for me, you f*cking bastard!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\" Xu Xiaoxiao was the first to burst into laughter. That explained why the policeman hated Qin Guan. Never underestimate a father's rage. They would hurt anyone who tried to get close to their little girl.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's adventure at the police station was only a tiny interlude in his life though. Meanwhile, his team was getting ready for the trip to the Milan Fashion Week. Unlike their previous trips, Qin Guan didn't have to fight alone for a part-time job at this event.</p><br/><p>He had received an official invitation from the organizing committee. He was going to be the representative of all the Chinese models at the event, which was the pride of Milan. Milan Fashion Week was among the top four international fashion weeks, and all the brands that were invited or had qualified to attend it were top brands in their own countries.</p><br/><p>Rising stars would also get a chance to shine on the last day. If they had a powerful enough background and an outstanding concept, they would get to participate in the event. Milan Fashion Week was considered a weatherglass for the sales of top brands. It certainly deserved that title.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Qin Guan had not accepted any offers for little money, like he had at the Beijing Fashion Week, or rejected any offers from unfamiliar parties, like he had in New York.</p><br/><p>He would go to Milan as an ambassador of both Armani and China.</p><br/><p>A group of people went out of the terminal in Milan. Several business cars were waiting for them at the exit. Even though this was the capital of fashion, they still stood out.</p><br/><p>The group was led by two Asian women. The first one was cool and decisive, and the second one was very capable at dealing with men. The man following them was exquisite. Although he was surrounded by others, he was still under the spotlight.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a traditional Chinese garment made of black silk, a pair of loose pants and a pair of cloth shoes. His outstanding demeanor resembled that of an immortal.</p><br/><p>To the people of Milan, the man seemed like a gift from Heaven.</p><br/><p>There were 20 people following him, including Yin's group and his exclusive stylist. They got into their cars quickly, leaving the bystanders to stare at their backs.</p><br/><p>Milan was one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the world. Its important economic status had nothing to do with the Fashion Week though. One needed to pay attention to its art and culture.</p><br/><p>Four percent of the most treasured art in the world was in Milan, and all top fashion brands had independent agencies there. More than half of the top-brand headquarters were located in the city, which was a holy place for international designers.</p><br/><p>The Duomo di Milano reached the sky like white flames, showing the might of the fashion capital. The great Leonardo da Vinci had left his best paintings there, and the La Scala Theater Orchestra was the most popular international opera.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

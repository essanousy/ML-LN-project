All they could do was rely on themselves.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan reached the parking lot and started pulling the doors of luxury cars open one after the other. They were not safe yet. It was actually easier to get caught in the empty parking lot.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan opened a Rolls Royce. He had no time to look at the people inside. He just turned around and pushed Armani in the car.</p><br/><p>\"Stay here, sir. I have to save the others!\"</p><br/><p>Then he rushed back to Sister Xue and Yin Changtao without looking back.</p><br/><p>Armani didn't come back to his senses until he sat back against the soft leather seat. I'm safe! He straightened his suit and sized up the owner of the car, who was sitting next to him in the backseat.</p><br/><p>\"Armani, how are you?\" A big hand with a black-gem ring was stretched out towards him.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know me?\"</p><br/><p>\"You are the pride of Italy and the godfather of fashion. As a godfather from Sicily, I have been looking forward to meeting you for a long time.\"</p><br/><p>Salvador shook hands with Armani, giving him a classic coquettish smile. By then, Qin Guan had returned to the square and found it in utter disorder.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Xue! Yin Changtao! I'm here! Run!\"</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of his height, Qin Guan found Sister Xue and Yin stumbling in the crowd. The bikini fighters were chasing the flustered crowd like zombies. Thanks to Yin's colorful outfit, Qin Guan was able to spot them easily.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan! He's back!\"</p><br/><p>\"Come on, fighters!\"</p><br/><p>The girls were followed by some angry security guards and cunning reporters.</p><br/><p>I'm their target again. Am I the BOSS in a game or something?</p><br/><p>Speechless, Qin Guan squeezed into the crowd and rushed over to Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? Run!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Yin run up to him in surprise. A girl was chasing them closely.</p><br/><p>\"Watch out!\" Qin Guan had no time to warn them. He just took action immediately.</p><br/><p>He lifted both of them on his shoulders with a roar.</p><br/><p>\"Hold on to me!\"</p><br/><p>The two of them had to cooperate with Qin Guan to maintain their balance. Actually, Yin's feet were still on the ground, but Qin Guan was not paying attention to details. All he knew was that the people he wanted to save were both in his arms.</p><br/><p>You should lose some weight, Sister Xue!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan ran again, shocking their pursuers. His rescue mission looked a lot like a hijacking.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Another wonderful picture! Take a snap! What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>Soon, the absurd trio reached the parking lot, followed by a group of excited spectators. Some slower girls were caught by the security guards, but some others followed Qin Guan to the parking lot.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan slowed down as soon as he reached his destination. Smiling in relief, he got ready to put the two guys down.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, don't stop! Run!\" Armani roared from the open door of the Rolls Royce.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tightened his arms again with a shiver. Yin was speechless. Dude, I can run myself. Let me go! Please!</p><br/><p>Words were pointless. All that mattered was running!</p><br/><p>\"Faster... faster...\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan threw his friends into the car and climbed inside himself.</p><br/><p>Crack! The owner of the car closed the door calmly.</p><br/><p>The redhead paused before the black Rolls Royce, sobering up enough to put down her small bucket and board.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

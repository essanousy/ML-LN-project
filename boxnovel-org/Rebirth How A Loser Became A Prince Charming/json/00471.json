He was the perfect man! If only he had been single...</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations, Qin Guan. I saw your film!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, dude, will you sue the newspapers? Can I attend the hearing?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took no notice of this. As long as his girlfriend was not suspicious of him, he was afraid of nothing.</p><br/><p>He was carefully listening to the tutor. All professors loved a meticulous student.</p><br/><p>Xu was thinking about sharing a wonderful idea with Qin Guan after class. Both he and Han Zhujiu were intrigued by it.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the largest radio station in America was broadcasting Ryan\u2019s press conference. Ryan resigned from The New York Times. Looking grieved, he handed the microphone to Joseph Lelyveld, who had been chosen to replace him by the board.</p><br/><p>Facing the media, Lelyveld made a wonderful, profound speech not just about his newspaper, but also about the media circle in America. He also confirmed all the reasonable deficiency claims caused by the fake news.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Blair welcomed another group of policemen at his home, even though he had been bailed out.</p><br/><p>\"You have been accused of fraud...\"</p><br/><p>Feeling pain all over his body, Blair was forced to get into a police cruiser for a second time. All he could do was withdraw all his money to get a good lawyer and reduce the compensation as much as possible.</p><br/><p>Three days later, the brilliant news were still on the media. Ordinary American people attached great importance to their right to be informed. In their opinion, Ryan's resignation made sense.</p><br/><p>The media stocks in NASDAQ were also influenced, which caused public anger.</p><br/><p>Lu Ruiheng, a reporter stationed in the US, who was working for the Xinhua News Agency, was gloating about the scandal. He was interested in the Chinese actor involved in the matter.</p><br/><p>The news of the scandal were spreading around the world.</p><br/><p>The Chinese media showed sensitivity though. \"China Daily\" published some articles about the truth, so Qin Guan appeared on the media again after a few days. He was not in the entertainment section this time though. He had made the headlines of several newspapers.</p><br/><p>\"Reflecting on...\"</p><br/><p>\"The truth about...\u2019</p><br/><p>The titles were getting more and more serious.</p><br/><p>All the reports attributed everything to Qin Guan\u2019s influence in the US. As a result, Qin Guan became the hero who had defended the people's right to know the truth.</p><br/><p>More and more young cynics became his fans. Some keyboard men [1] let go of their prejudice against handsome men and joined his fan club. They considered him a pioneer of the resistance against imperialism.</p><br/><p>Thanks a lot.</p><br/><p>The situation in both China and America was favorable. As an honest Chinese boy, Qin Guan didn't ask for millions of dollars as compensation. Listening to Cui Ming's suggestion, he and his team of gangsters sued only for a reasonable amount. </p><br/><p>The intelligent boy won the hearts of the staff of The New York Times, who thought that he had only intended to solve a problem, not loot a burning house. He had never sold any information to other publishers, and they appreciated his kindness.</p><br/><p>In the end, the two parties settled out of court. Lelyveld cashed the compensation out to Qin Guan's lawyer. Then he dedicated a whole section to a written apology to pay him back.</p><br/><p>Blair was not as lucky though. Cui Ming sued him for an extremely big amount of money. He wouldn't be able to escape from that case as long as he lived. That was why lawyers were often called \"vampires\" in the US.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Guan felt that Blair\u2019s life was hopeless.</p><br/><p>\"Isn\u2019t it cruel to make him go bankrupt?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry. There are government grants for people who go bankrupt.\"</p><br/><p>\"We need him to apologize.\"</p><br/><p>Well, good luck to you.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fixed his eyes on the form in his hands again. It was a registration form for professional actors. He slowly filled in his first achievement in the blank space. It was his first acting award: the Best Actor Award of the Cannes Festival.</p><br/><p>He clicked on the mouse to send the form out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why didn't they tell us earlier?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Wang Lei were sad to see the men go.</p><br/><p> ...</p><br/><p> Mou Xiaoliu was also feeling sad. She had completely lost her way. The passengers moving to-and-fro watched the petite girl carrying two large bags as she shuttled down the hall, the corridors and the bus stops.</p><br/><p> The two bags she was carrying on her shoulders were almost as tall as she was. Her face wasn't red, and she was not breathing heavily, but the sweat on her forehead showed that she was a little hot from running. When she reached the square again, she finally saw the poster of the Capital University of Finance and Economics.</p><br/><p> Reassured, she calmed down. After moving the bags further up on her shoulders, she carefully sped up. As she walked, she was thinking about the pickles her mother had made, wondering if they had spilled when she had been walking fast.</p><br/><p> The girl reached the reception and looked at the savior standing behind the table with shinning eyes. Thank god they put such a large poster on the square, or I\u2019d be searching for a long time! Oh my! My savior is so good-looking! He's 100 times more handsome than the language teacher in Taohua Town. Mou Xiaoliu considered this her lucky day. She had finally arrived at the capital after a long trip and numerous trials, enrolled at the university of her dreams, and met a handsome upperclassman. For Mou Xiaoliu, life couldn't get any better.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan looked up and saw a small girl with red, round cheeks. She was just standing in front of the table with shinning eyes, watching him silently in a silly, yet cute way.</p><br/><p> He smiled at the girl. \"Are you a fellow student? Are you a freshman at our university?\"</p><br/><p> The little girl nodded silently with a silly smile. Qin Guan smiled back and asked, \"Did you bring your admission letter? I can help you register.\"</p><br/><p> The girl came back to her senses and nodded hard. She put the large bags down carefully and took her admission letter out of a pocket on her chest.</p><br/><p> Checking the letter, Qin Guan wrote her name down on the freshmen list. As he handed the letter back to her, he warned her, \"Keep it safe.\"</p><br/><p> Mou Xiaoliu nodded again. She put the letter back in her pocket and tried to pick up the two bags.</p><br/><p> The bags were too big for a little girl, so Qin Guan stood up, said something to Wang Lei, and told Mou Xiaoliu that he would carry one of them to the shuttle bus for her.</p><br/><p> Mou Xiaoliu was happy that he offered, but she waved her hands in an effort to stop him. \"I don't need help, I can manage myself. My luggage is quite heavy.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled with confidence. Are you kidding? If a little girl like you can carry two bags, a strong young man like me can carry one without breaking a sweat. Qin Guan picked up the larger bag with one hand and tried to lift it. The bag remained completely still. It seems like I underestimated the enemy. He exerted all his strength again, but the bag didn't move.</p><br/><p> Wang Lei buried his face behind the table. I'm sorry, dude, but I can't bear to watch. Embarrassed, Qin Guan stole a glance at Mou Xiaoliu, who was still looking at him in admiration. Alas, the upperclassman might not be stronger than Da Niu in my village, but he is indeed handsome.</p><br/><p>My girl, good looks do not equal strength.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan secretly let out a relieved breath when he saw that the girl wasn't showing disdain at his weakness. No man could bear to be called useless. Grinding his back teeth, he suddenly used all his strength, lifting the bag up to his shoulder.</p><br/><p> Ignoring his wicked friend Wang Lei, who was laughing loudly on the side, Qin Guan told Mou Xiaoliu proudly, \"Follow me to the shuttle.\" Mou Xiaoliu lifted the other bag with one hand and carried it on her shoulder with ease, following Qin Guan happily.</p><br/><p> As she walked with him, she was still wondering why the other upperclassman had been laughing so much. Little girl, there's an old saying that says, 'In the eye of the lover, his beloved is always a beauty'. You are completely ignoring his weak, faltering steps, because you're focused on his butt.</p><br/><p> Breathing heavily, Qin Guan managed to keep moving forward. On the way, he told Mou Xiaoliu, \"Follow the tutor to the reception after you get off the bus. Hand in the education and dormitory fees first.\"</p><br/><p> Mou Xiaoliu nodded tactfully.</p><br/><p> After taking another breath, Qin Guan went on, \"Put away your receipt and train ticket to the capital. You can get a refund for them.\"</p><br/><p> \"Read carefully all the materials, including the \u2018College Student Tutorial\u2019, \u2018Life Guidance for College Students\u2019, and the special freshmen issues in our university magazine.\"</p><br/><p> Mou Xiaoliu nodded again. I can get a refund for my ticket. That's great!</p><br/><p> Qin Guan helped her lift her luggage to the compartment above her head as he advised her kind-heartedly, \"Ask the upperclassman on this bus for help when you get off. You're such a petite girl. Be careful so you don't drop them.\"</p><br/><p> Before she could express her appreciation, Qin Guan added, \"Leave your telephone number to your tutor and the teacher in charge of your class. It will be useful in the future. This year, our university will grant student loans to all students who qualify. You can consult with the teacher in charge when you pay the fees.\"</p><br/><p> Mou Xiaoliu was close to tears. He is so kind. I\u2019ll be the happiest girl in my village! She took a bow before Qin Guan and said loudly, \"Thank you so much! I\u2019ll do my best!\" Then she looked up at him with her shinning eyes.</p><br/><p> Looking around, Qin Guan felt a little embarrassed by her sincere appreciation. He waved the silly little girl off. \"Don't mention it, it's my duty. The bus is nearly full. Take care of yourself. I\u2019ll off!\" He greeted his fellow students and tutors on the bus shyly before running away as fast as he could.</p><br/><p> When he got back to the reception, Wang Lei was busy with registrations. Qin Guan rushed to help him relieve the pressure. When the wave of students got on the bus, Wang Lei turned to Qin Guan and started to laugh again, remembering the previous scene.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan tried to explain awkwardly, \"The bag was really heavy. It might have been 50 kilos. I wonder what she'd put inside.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Lei shook his head and touched his glasses, pretending to be serious as he asked gloatingly, \"My fellow student, this is the first time you fail to look cool in a really long time. What's your opinion on this?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

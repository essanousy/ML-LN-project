They clearly knew about their upcoming misfortune, but they had no idea how to restrain the actors, as their contracts were about to expire. They would be free to leave soon.</p><br/><p>The only thing they could do was try their best to keep the actors that were on Huayi's side. They considered their previous partner Qin Guan one of them.</p><br/><p>They didn't want to lose such a powerful actor after all. They had to compete for every available resource.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had unexpectedly returned to China and agreed to have a meeting with them. He also wanted to purchase some original shares of the company. All senior staff members and directors of the company had the same right.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xun though, who was an ex-partner of theirs, had turned down a similar offer. They didn't force anyone, they simply tried to promote a sense of union between the actors and the company during these turbulent times.</p><br/><p>This was just like the internal pre-sale of Baidu and the employee benefits of all emerging technology companies. Qin Guan is interested in the shares! He will have to pay in cash, won't he? Does this mean that...</p><br/><p>The Brothers did not enjoy their tea. They stood up right away and took Qin Guan's hands.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin\u2026 No, Brother Qin\u2026 Do you really mean that?</p><br/><p>\"Yes. My lawyer will get in touch with you to discuss all the details. The amount will be decided by the price. We can discuss this further later. Is that okay?\"</p><br/><p>The Brothers said that it was. Qin Guan trusted them with the press conference and other similar matters. They had experience on such things after all. They were both shareholders and performers.</p><br/><p>They left the private yard late at night, while the candles and lanterns were still burning silently. The professional servers didn't complain about the hard work. Their high salary guaranteed their efficiency and discretion.</p><br/><p> They still liked to gossip though. In the silent night, the girls took off their cheongsams and cleaned the yard in their household clothes. The supervisor pinned a VIP label on the gate of the yard to indicate that it had been reserved. </p><br/><p>A girl carrying a tray with cups whispered to her, \"Sister Li, the member's name was Qin Guan. I saw his application form! I dared not look up at him while I served the tea, but I noticed his age and physique more or less. Was he the famous actor?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Li, who was an experienced staff member, didn't seem to care.</p><br/><p>\"He will return one day. You can take a look then. Whoever he is, don't forget our work regulations!\"</p><br/><p>Frustrated, the girl walked to the operation room helplessly. I can have no private contact with any member of the club... I need the money. Goodbye, my idol...</p><br/><p>The investment process was very simple. It was actually harder to find a proper chance to reveal Qin Guan's return to the media.</p><br/><p>They couldn't delay it too much, or the reporters would eventually spot him. As the Brothers were thinking about that, Director Feng Xiaogang reminded them of something.</p><br/><p>Feng had gone to them to get resources for his film. \"See? Zhang Yimou went to the Athens Closing Ceremony to shoot his own sports documentary. What are you saving all that money for? Just give it to me! I won't destroy your reputation!\"</p><br/><p>The Brothers suddenly felt inspired. We forgot about this completely. The \"Chinese Stamp\" documentary will be aired during the Closing Ceremony of the Olympics! Qin Guan will appear before a worldwide audience! This is a big event for humanity!</p><br/><p>Nothing could top that. All Chinese people would be shocked by the power of their motherland and feel proud of being Chinese.</p><br/><p>When the day came, the highly anticipated film was played on a giant screen in the crowded stadium. The screen, which was hundreds of meters long and tens of meters high, lit up slowly in the dark.</p><br/><p>The bright colors and melodious background music revealed the mystery of China to the entire world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Naturally, Qin Guan was assigned a task as soon as he arrived.</p><br/><p>The assistant director, who was in charge of the figurants and the main actors, walked over to Qin Guan with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"How are you doing, Qin Guan? Are you tired after your long journey? Your scene is next. Could you give the others a lesson in your spare time?\"</p><br/><p>He dared not shout at a Best Actor Award winner, like Director Zhang did. Although the young man had shot no famous films in China, he was a two-time Best Actor Award winner. Very seldom did a Chinese actor win such an award abroad, so all the winners were worshipped in the domestic film circle.</p><br/><p>Even though he hadn't been tested in China, Qin Guan was still a gift from god in the eyes of the investors.</p><br/><p>The assistant director was kind and careful as he talked to him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was an easy-going man, agreed right away. All the people around him were big shots in their own industries.</p><br/><p>It's a pity that I did not bring Cong Nianwei. The director of the Sculpting Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts is also here.</p><br/><p>The Chinese stamp at the beginning of the film was his work.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's team got to work. Sister Xue gathered the dancers to teach them some basic shooting skills, while Qin Guan was responsible for the main actors during the scene.</p><br/><p>\"Grandpa Qian, you don't need to walk in during the scene. Just look up while you're carving the jade, so the cameraman can film the side of your face. Don't pay attention to the camera under the glass. It will be recording automatically.\"</p><br/><p>\"The dancers' job is a lot easier. Lin Juanjuan, do you see that white circle on the ground? That's your position. You can do anything you like within it.\"</p><br/><p>The three dancers were looking at him with sparkling eyes. They were all leading figures within their own industry, but Qin Guan would be their teacher while they shot the film.</p><br/><p> Zhang Yimou smiled until wrinkles formed on his face. I didn't think Qin Guan would like teaching others.</p><br/><p>\"Are you ready? We can watch the other actors perform now. Don't be nervous. Your parts are short. Plus, they showcase your abilities. Just follow my instructions.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded in unison. Zhang Yimou suddenly remembered something and pointed to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"You go first. Show them what you can do!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan walked out boldly.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a loose linen outfit. His cyan pants were hanging down over his black cloth shoes as he walked to the site leisurely. He sneezed three times on his way there.</p><br/><p>His thin clothes and the shooting location were to blame.</p><br/><p>The bamboo house was located next to a lake, and white mist was lingering around the area. The place was not inhabitable by any means.</p><br/><p>Cold air rose up from the silver waves as an autumn breeze blew above the lake and over to the bamboo house. Qin Guan was sitting in the center of the hall, facing the green mountains and the blue lake. The thin bamboo-paved road led to the wharf on the bank.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea how ancient people had been able to behave so elegantly in such an environment, but he knew why those talented people had died at a young age. They must have frozen to death.</p><br/><p>Nobody showed any mercy on him. Everyone was completely absorbed in the beautiful scenery.</p><br/><p>\"Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan began performing.</p><br/><p>He sat cross-legged on the ground before a traditional Chinese table with a pile of bamboo slips on it.</p><br/><p>Both his back and neck were straight. He seemed to be talking with ancient people across a one-thousand-year timeline.</p><br/><p>His clothes were blowing in the wind as he held an elegant brush in his hand.</p><br/><p>The brush, which was soaked in dense ink, was dancing on the bamboo slips, leaving characters behind it. The script was of a regular but old style that only used characters.</p><br/><p>The camera shifted from his back and the elegant handwriting to his face. What an exquisite young man!</p><br/><p>There was an ancient poem that started with the phrase \"A jade-like person walking on the field...\" That phrase could describe the scene aptly.</p><br/><p>Grandpa Qian, who had been a representative of painters, calligraphers and sculptors in the 1930s, was completely lost in the scene.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Performing was in Qin Guan's nature. Just follow me and watch the overall process.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan: \"Really? Am I already a nobleman? Hurry up! I don't need a medicinal bath, I need food! I want a three-day feast!\" The lines seemed tailored for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wenxue: \"What's your hurry? The Queen granted you a bath for spirit compensation.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan (looking around): \"Really? Okay, I\u2019ll stay for a while then.\" It was so harmonious with Qin Guan\u2019s true qualities.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was speechless with Qin Guan's luck. Zhang Changzong was just as funny a guy as he was.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was ignorant about the next part though. Zhao Weixue was trying to brainwash him. \"The most important reign is manipulating someone else's love. It\u2019s a more splendid achievement than controlling a territory. It has real-life significance!\" There were smooth ancient lyrics playing as background music. They sounded deep and arousing.</p><br/><p>Director, this is way too literal for a conversation between toy boys.</p><br/><p>After that speech, Zhao Wenxun took off his clothes and entered the bathing pool. The two of them enjoyed some quiet time together. The artistic picture of bathing beauties was mesmerizing.</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" the director said. Qin Guan's work for that day finally ended.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wenxue helped a wet Qin Guan out of the pool and patted his shoulder in encouragement. \"Well done! Cheers!\"</p><br/><p>Then he left, showing Qin Guan his handsome back view. Fortunately, the guy is feeble from hunger, otherwise he might steal the show from me.</p><br/><p>It would be embarrassing if he was reading lines and the audience kept watching Qin Guan in the pool.</p><br/><p>In the following days, Qin Guan rode a flying crane, blew a bamboo flute, hunted deer, argued with ministers, and experienced a palace revolution.</p><br/><p>Finally, it was time for his and Shangguan Wanr\u2019s [1] cuddling scene.</p><br/><p>By that time, Qin Guan had become friends with the whole crew. Li Bingbing, the actress who played the other princess, made jokes with him.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, is this your first time doing a cuddling scene?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded conscientiously. \"It's my first time acting and doing a cuddling scene.\"</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing smiled. \"That's good. Don't forget to tell me when you shoot it. I\u2019d be happy to watch.\"</p><br/><p>You\u2019re here to make fun of me? I thought you were here to offer guidance!</p><br/><p>Everyone around was smiling, taking pleasure in his misfortune. Nobody was kind enough to help him. Qin Guan gritted his teeth, \"Hey! You jerks! There\u2019s nothing to cuddling. Just wait for my performance!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Shangguan Wanr were looking at each other silently in their white pajamas, expressing tenderness and love through their eyes. The burning candles cracked in the quiet night. \"Camera!\" the director said.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shed silent tears for Shangguan. \"I don't know what I want my life to be like. My brother chose this life for me when I was a child.\"</p><br/><p>Taking pity on him, Shangguan caressed his cheeks and embraced him. She leaned her head on Qin Guan's shoulder. The actress was very capricious. His broad chest and thick shoulders are so sexy in my arms!</p><br/><p>Her mind drifted away as Qin Guan recited his lines. \"Nobody in the world loves me. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what love is.\"</p><br/><p>Then it was time for Shangguan to speak. Li Shaohong waited by the camera, but nothing happened.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? If you forgot your lines, you\u2019d better tell us!\"</p><br/><p>The actress tried her best to get herself together and apologized to the crew. The scene began again from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>She was at a loss for words during her conversation with Qin Guan. They stopped for a second time.</p><br/><p>They exchanged heated words as the actress stammered. They had to stop for a third time.</p><br/><p>The director was speechless, but she yelled at them to stop again.</p><br/><p>As a green hand in a TV play, Qin Guan didn't think that anything was wrong. He just listened to the director.</p><br/><p>Unbelievable! Li Bingbing pulled the actress aside and said in a low voice, \"That's enough! I know what you\u2019re thinking about, but this is too many takes! Enough!\"</p><br/><p>The girl glanced at Li disapprovingly. \"You\u2019re such a hypocrite! Even the figurants want to be intimate with Qin Guan! I can\u2019t pass up such a good opportunity. Are you jealous? Too bad your character loves Zhang Yizhe. Ah! Stop! I\u2019ll behave myself next time!\"</p><br/><p>Before Li could smack her on the forehead, Shangguan started begging for mercy. Then she shared Qin Guan's secret with Li.</p><br/><p>\"Believe me, you didn't hug him...\" The two beautiful girls started talking lasciviously.</p><br/><p>Their subject wasn\u2019t romance, but pedication.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s scenes were over when Zhang Changzong died during the revolution. By then, Zhao Wenxun, his partner for most of the play, had almost become Qin Guan's older brother.</p><br/><p>The boy looks elegant and perfect, but he\u2019s silly in nature. He is sincere with others and hard-working. He never complaints about anything.</p><br/><p>As a green hand in TV plays, Qin Guan couldn't control the position of the camera and the interpretation of his role at the beginning. The director always shouted at him, but he just smiled like silly, touching his head and letting things go.</p><br/><p>After the shooting, he would consult with the older actors and the director as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>His most valuable virtue was his intelligence. The clever boy had been gifted with an extraordinary retentive memory, which was highly praised by all the staff.</p><br/><p>He had to be some kind of genius. He was not arrogant either, although talented people usually were.</p><br/><p>They all got to like the young man in the process and grew very close with him.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] Queen Wu Zetian\u2019s maid and officer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

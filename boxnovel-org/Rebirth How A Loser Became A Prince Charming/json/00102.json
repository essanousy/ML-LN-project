In his battle for love, he had been utterly defeated. As he\u2019d thought about this, Chi had looked around and seen the onlookers pointing at him and talking.</p><br/><p>\"See, he was rejected.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's terrible. He held that girl with such force!\"</p><br/><p>\"He also shouted at her.\"</p><br/><p>\"He's scary. I wouldn\u2019t want to have such a pursuer.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly.\"</p><br/><p>Congratulations, Chi! You became famous around the area. Chi had felt hopeless.</p><br/><p>Carrying the bouquet, he had walked to his dormitory slowly, getting sadder and sadder by the minute.</p><br/><p>His failure had taken place in public, so he\u2019d felt that he had nothing left to live for. Pushing open the door of his dormitory, he had thrown the deliberately chosen bouquet into the dustbin without hesitation. Falling on his bed, he had tried recall the details of his relationship with Cong Nianwei. (My dear boy, it was all in your imagination. Can time spent in the same class be considered a relationship?)</p><br/><p>His thoughts had been really sad. The earlier scene and the words of the onlookers had resurfaced in his mind again and again. I\u2019ll be renowned all over the university. (You overestimate yourself. QH is a large university. You are just a nobody there.) Finally, his thoughts had turned to death.</p><br/><p>He had slowly gotten up, opened the drawer, and taken something out. Then he had called Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>\"Goodbye, Cong Nianwei. I\u2019ll end my life at the place where we met for the first time. I\u2019ll be cherishing your smile in my heart.\"</p><br/><p>Before she could say something, he had hung up. What a romantic farewell!</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, Chi had called all his good friends before he\u2019d left, so all his classmates had found out that he no longer wished to live after that unsuccessful confession. What a drama queen! Cong Nianwei hadn\u2019t cared about the call. However, not long after, some classmates who were close to Chi had run to Cong Nianwei one after the other for help. They couldn't find Chi Hailin anymore.</p><br/><p>Thus, Cong Nianwei had realized that the matter was serious. Chi had said that he would take his own life at the place where they\u2019d met for the first time. The problem was that she had no recollection of that place. She couldn't remember the first time she had met Chi at all!</p><br/><p>All the girls were anxious. Unconsciously, Cong Nianwei had thought of Qin Guan. Under ordinary circumstances, he was a playful guy, but for her, he was unexplainably reliable. A boyfriend was the one a girl could rely on in such a situation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had flied over at Cong Nianwei\u2019s call and met her at the entrance of QH. By that time, Chi\u2019s classmates had scattered around the campus, looking for traces of him. Zhao Tianyi, Chi's best friend and silly partner, followed Cong Nianwei around, acting like an animal with acute intuition. In his opinion, that was the best way to find Chi Hailin.</p><br/><p>Actually, he was overthinking this. Cong Nianwei had no idea what was going on, that's why she had called her boyfriend for help.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianyi saw three students getting off a taxi. One of them was Qin Guan, Cong Nianwei\u2019s boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianyi jumped at Qin Guan, cursing, \"You dare come here to chat with your girlfriend? You killed Chi!\" Qin Guan nearly laughed out loud. I came all this way for Chi, because my girlfriend is scared. Whose fault is this? You are blaming your anger on others! Do you consider yourself a role model?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't bear to leave with Cong Nianwei. Chi's death had nothing to do with her after, but she was a tender person.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a long breath and pushed Zhao\u2019s hand aside. Taking Cong Nianwei\u2019s hand, he told her, \"I have thought about this on the way here. It's not our fault. Chi was taking advantage of your kindness to force you to give in. If he really wanted to commit suicide, why didn't he find a quiet place? Why did he inform so many people? He is just striving for other people\u2019s sympathy. It\u2019s disgusting that a QH student would use their IQ in this way.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianyi wanted to object, but he didn't know what to say. Nobody was that silly. They all understood gradually when they calmed down. The students slowed down their steps. Qin Guan was comforting his girlfriend, trying to get her to remember, \"Which way did you go when you registered at QH?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei, who had calmed down by then, tried to recall, \"I went through the main entrance and walked this way like most people.\" They had walked that way until they had reached the dormitory building. Cong Nianwei finally pulled at Qin Guan. \"I remember! After I unpacked my luggage, my parents and I went through the trees to the lake to do some sightseeing.\"</p><br/><p>They all ran to the lake. On the way there, they saw Chi's roommate. The boy ran up to them breathlessly. His eyes lit up when he saw Cong Nianwei. He asked them excitedly, \"Did you find him?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan asked him to calm down. \"We are looking for him. What\u2019s the matter?\"</p><br/><p>The boy got even more anxious. He shouted at Cong Nianwei hysterically, \"Why are you still here? He took pills!\"</p><br/><p>\"How do you know that?\" Qin Guan asked him calmly. \"What kind of pills? How many did he take?\"</p><br/><p>Are you kidding? Whenever Chi caught a cold, he\u2019d take two packs of Herba Thesii!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

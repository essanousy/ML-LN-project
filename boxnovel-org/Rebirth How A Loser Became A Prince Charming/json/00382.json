We\u2019ll take him to my restaurant. It must be closed now.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoxiao and Qin Guan spread the gown on the ground and carried Han on the temporary stretcher. They pulled him in the direction of the car. \"Will you go home or stay with me?\" Qin Guan asked Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was worried about him. \"Let\u2019s stay together. I\u2019ll just keep silent.\" The two boys nodded.</p><br/><p>The quality of the gown was really bad. It had not been made in China. As a result, it got torn under the tension, and Han fell down with a bang.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he had fainted. Taking advantage of this, Xu just pulled him up and stuffed him into the car.</p><br/><p>After making several calls, Xu closed his eyes to relax. The driver chose to go around the block, where Qin Guan had encountered the three black men.</p><br/><p>There were parties and balls held everywhere in the area, but that block was silent. It seemed ghostly thanks to the horrific Halloween decorations.</p><br/><p>The luxurious car would be prey for evil men there. However, they saw nobody on the streets. This was actually the domain of black gangs, who could do anything to such a car.</p><br/><p>Xu looked at the quiet street with a serious expression. According to his knowledge of New York, even if there were no robbers around, there would be at least some gangsters to show them their middle fingers.</p><br/><p>Yet there was no one there...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked out of the window. He saw some men hiding at the corner of a house. He could only see part of their clothes and feet.</p><br/><p>He remained silent. This was not China after all.</p><br/><p>They reached their destination in a few minutes. The back door of the restaurant was open. In the hall, two long dining tables had been arranged.</p><br/><p>There were white disposable medical sheets, a medicine cabinet and small bottles on the table. It all looked very professional.</p><br/><p>\"Your daddy never called me.\"</p><br/><p>A young Asian man was sitting in a large wooden chair of a traditional Chinese style. He had curly hair, and a mask was hanging from one of his ears. According to Xu, he was the best private doctor there was.</p><br/><p>\"Save him...\" Xu didn't say much. His driver and staff carried Han to the table.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Let me have a look. Then we\u2019ll talk about money.\" He smartly cut Han\u2019s clothes off.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, there is a lady present. You don't need to take off his underwear...\" Qin Guan stood in front of Cong Nianwei for fear that she would get frightened.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jingtao frowned. Although most of his face was hidden under the mask, his impatient eyes expressed his dissatisfaction. When he glanced back at Qin Guan though, his eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>Distracted, he said in a trembling voice, \"Oh, my beautiful girl! It would be a sin to let you see such dirty things. Hurry up and pull the curtain.\"</p><br/><p>He scanned Cong Nianwei from head to toe carefully, making her feel uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my! My beautiful Asian girl... Your foot is hurt badly!\"</p><br/><p>He walked up to Cong Nianwei, taking off his mask in the process. \"No, the lady deserves help more than that guy.\"</p><br/><p>Are you kidding? You forgot the oath of Hippocrates?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Han opened his eyes and seized Zhou Jingtao. \"If you don't help me, I\u2019ll break your neck!\"</p><br/><p>There was a savage Buddha tattoo on his chest and a fierce tiger on his arm. Han looked even more vigorous that moment.</p><br/><p>As an experienced underground doctor though, Zhou wasn\u2019t afraid of threats.</p><br/><p>\"I could send you to Hell with one cut! Where does it hurt, bro? Bullet or knife? I\u2019ll get you fixed up immediately. I\u2019m a kind-hearted man. I like saving lives!\"</p><br/><p>At the sight of a small tattoo on Han\u2019s body, Zhou had changed his attitude at once.</p><br/><p>He is a member of the Black Star Union. He\u2019s actually their leader! The shining black Big Dipper tattoo on his chest indicates his identity. He is in the fiercest Chinese gang in New York. Not one of the fiercest, but the fiercest!</p><br/><p>The Black Star Union had originally been a friendly Chinese group of special troops and veterans from the Chinese mainland. In two years though, they had taken the place of the Chinese Freemasons and built a solid foundation in Chinatown.</p><br/><p>They eliminated entire families over small disputes. They had experienced many cruel battles, and no offenders ever made it out of them alive. That was why Zhou Jingtao was frightened. </p><br/><p>One couldn't reason with crazy men.</p><br/><p>The treating process went very well. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei sat in two chairs and watched Zhou perform surgery through the transparent plastic curtain.</p><br/><p>Any professional would have been surprised by his speed and accuracy. He made a perfect knot at the end of the line and finished his job.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Han\u2019s vessels had not been seriously wounded, or he would have spent all his fortune on emergency blood packages from the black market.</p><br/><p>Xu showed up confidently after the surgery, holding a thick package in his hand.</p><br/><p>\"How much?\"</p><br/><p>\"Old rules. 50,000 dollars in cash.\"</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cker! Isn't your usual fee 5,000 dollars?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Cong Nianwei would rush over to him, all flushed and happy.</p><br/><p>He parked the car in the parking lot and smiled like stupid as he got out.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\" a man called his name from behind him.</p><br/><p>He turned around and saw a thin old man with brown glasses. The old man was Cong Nianwei's university professor, the very one who had suggested that she go study abroad.</p><br/><p>The professor was Cong Nianwei's career guide and a very kind educator. He was familiar with Qin Guan, as he was his student's boyfriend.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's me. How are you, professor? I'm looking for Cong Nianwei.\"</p><br/><p>\"Didn't she tell you that her team would be on a construction site?\"</p><br/><p>\"What? I just returned from Zhejiang. She didn't tell me anything about that.\"</p><br/><p>The professor shot a curious glance into the car and saw the bouquet.</p><br/><p>Is this a romantic surprise? Tough luck! She is not here!</p><br/><p>The professor, who was a considerate man, told Qin Guan where to find his girlfriend.</p><br/><p>\"The Olympic Park will be built on the North 4th Ring Road. You should go look for her over there.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone likes me! But I already knew that!</p><br/><p>Pleased, Qin Guan picked out a flower from the bouquet and handed it to the professor.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much! We'll drop by your home and visit someday. I'm too busy to buy you a gift today. I got something for Shanshan in Zhejiang.\"</p><br/><p>Shanshan was the professor's youngest daughter. She was only 17 years old and she was a fan of Qin Guan's.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his car and waved at the professor, who was looking at the flower blankly. Then he got in the car and drove away.</p><br/><p>\"Young man...\" The old man shook his head. This was the first flower he had received in his life.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was driving at full speed on the North 4th Ring Road. The real estate prices along the way had been sky-rocketing ever since the Olympic stadium had been built.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan unconsciously slowed down.</p><br/><p>Wow! This area is pretty good. Deluxe high-rise apartments... 20,000 Yuan... Large houses... Still under construction...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was completely distracted.</p><br/><p>Soon, he reached his destination. There was a simple blue-and-white wall around the construction site. Qin Guan drove directly into the site through the only entrance.</p><br/><p>It was a scene he had been really familiar with in his previous life. He pulled his car up to the temporary parking area smoothly. Thanks to his acute intuition, Qin Guan found Cong Nianwei easily.</p><br/><p>Her team was talking about the blueprint with the survey crew and the general engineer. Everyone was wearing yellow helmets and gray uniforms. Qin Guan, who was wearing haute couture, looked completely out of place there.</p><br/><p>Yes, he had dressed up for the occasion to impress Cong Nianwei. His white shirt, tailored British trousers, black leather shoes and shining wristwatch looked extraordinary. His clothes, in combination with the bouquet and his splendid smile, made him look like a royal.</p><br/><p>This was the wrong setting though. If it had been a landscape full of lakes and hills, or a bustling street, he would have looked beautiful. This was a construction site though, so he just looked stupid.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

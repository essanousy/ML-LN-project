Despite his tough demeanor and strong body, he felt like crying.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much\u2026 I'm so excited...\" Yin burst into tears on the stage.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan\u2026 Thank you so much...\"</p><br/><p>He was about to rush up to Qin Guan and stain his clothes with his tears and mucus.</p><br/><p>\"This outfit took 10 people and one month to make! It's made of fine materials and intricate embroidery. Unless you want to destroy it, don't cry in my arms!\"</p><br/><p>Yin stopped and wiped his tears away on his sleeves.</p><br/><p>Save your tears, young man. There is even more applause waiting for you.</p><br/><p>The audience let out a sigh of admiration for the designer.</p><br/><p>\"You are wonderful! I love your designs! You are an outstanding man!\"</p><br/><p>\"Darling, look up! Over here!\"</p><br/><p>They were getting closer to the stage, while buyers and brand businessmen blocked Sister Xue's way under the stage.</p><br/><p>\"I would like to be Andrew Gn's agent. Where do I apply for the job? Does he sell his designs to high-end flagship stores or shops in shopping malls?\"</p><br/><p>\"Would you have the ability to deal with the growing sales?\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder if the materials Andrew Gn uses could be sold to others.\"</p><br/><p>They expressed the desire to collaborate with the new brand, as they found boundless commercial opportunities and other possibilities in it.</p><br/><p>As the meritorious guy behind the curtain, Ye Dong felt overjoyed. He felt like he was walking on a cloud.</p><br/><p>Thank God I followed Qin Guan's advice and supplied those materials to the Chinese designer. The outcome was equal to Armani's.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had actually suggested the materials to Giorgio Armani. Ye Dong had gained a big contract.</p><br/><p>They didn't let the small fish go after catching the shark either. Even the smaller fish in Milan were international brands. J Clothing was just a baby compared to them.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>There seemed to be no end to the celebration. After a long time, the staff led the audience out. As all the models were changing clothes backstage, Ye Dong followed Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Well done, Qin Guan! In one year, your part-time job has taken you to the top of the world. Do you remember showing off to us after that gig at the car exhibition?\"</p><br/><p>Ye Dong was reminiscing with mixed feelings. Qin Guan was also feeling conflicted in the fitting room.</p><br/><p>Ye is right. Back then, I was satisfied with a few hundred yuan. Now I'm familiar with the stage, but I only use it as a tool to make more money.</p><br/><p>Ye was still babbling outside the fitting room. \"You are the pride of China. You should know that...\"</p><br/><p>He paused angrily, trying to squeeze the words out of his throat.</p><br/><p>\"I have been in Europe one month and met with plenty of associations, both official and not. I also visited some transnational family businesses. They are large-scale businesses with strict standards. Every link and detail is concrete in the clothing industry.\"</p><br/><p>\"Profit prevails. Everyone welcomes new producers and suppliers. Everyone is in need of cheaper materials after all. Where does dignity come in though? Is China doomed to be the supplier of the simplest and cheapest materials?\"</p><br/><p>\"Unprocessed silk, cotton, linen and wool are relying on cheap labor.\"</p><br/><p>Ye had gotten lost in his thoughts, but Qin Guan remained silent. All he could do now was listen.</p><br/><p>\"I'm not resigned to the current situation. That's why I met you in London. I wanted to give this a try. I brought high-end materials all the way from China just for you. I'm not familiar with the industry after all, so the official channels don't help me that much.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who would know that my roommate would be one of the top models in the Milan Fashion Week? You did this for me! I had spent so many days negotiating with everyone!\"</p><br/><p>Ye Dong was excited. He was a smoker, so he took a cigarette case out of his pocket unconsciously. Then he remembered that he was in the backstage area and put it back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Qu had succeeded in pushing Qin Guan into the last bus of a series that had one of the top 10 audience ratings on HBO.</p><br/><p>When he reached the shooting site, Qin Guan expressed his sincere respect for her powerful connections.</p><br/><p>\"Come here, Qin Guan. This is Essen, the director of the sixth season. Follow his instructions carefully.\"</p><br/><p>Essen, who was sitting on a folded chair, nodded at Qin Guan, who was slowly walking towards him. The crew usually announced the role requirements to the actor union and waited for actors to arrive. There were plenty of over-confident guys volunteering their services though, so Essen had chosen another way this time. He had accepted recommendations from other actors and crew members. Sister Xue\u2019s effort during the Oscars had earned Qin Guan a chance to audition for the part.</p><br/><p>The other candidate was a local handsome guy, who was very well-prepared. In order to portray the Wall Street elite, he had borrowed a special costume.</p><br/><p>Essen sized Qin Guan up from head to toe. Qin Guan was wearing a hoodie and a pair of jeans, which was typical student attire. Suddenly, he was enlightened.</p><br/><p>\"Try this scene.\" It was his first meeting with the heroine. He was an elite working on Wall Street, who parked his luxury car next to his new apartment.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was dressed like a decorator. Only when the crew drove the luxurious Hummer over did he feel the director\u2019s malice.</p><br/><p>He would need both acting skills and extreme beauty to cover up the disharmony between his costume and the props.</p><br/><p>The other actor was also harboring malicious intentions.</p><br/><p>\"Director, we could play the same scene for comparison\u2019s sake.\"</p><br/><p>If Qin Guan had had something sharp in his hand, he would have attacked him. The most horrible thing was the director\u2019s answer though. \"Okay, you go first.\"</p><br/><p>The American man had been looking for such a chance for a long time. If he could give a good performance in that famous series, he would be getting a lot more offers.</p><br/><p>He would bid goodbye to the turbulent times that he had to search everywhere for a role.</p><br/><p>Pitt took the car key confidently and fixed his black suit before pulling the car slowly to the side of the street.</p><br/><p>The hummer stopped and a tall, handsome man got out. He was wearing an upscale suit that went well with his luxurious car. He walked to the door of the apartment.</p><br/><p>His acting was quite satisfactory. Even the sexy Kim Cattrall, who was having a break on the set, couldn\u2019t help but shoot a look at Pitt. He\u2019s a handsome guy.</p><br/><p>Pitt stopped and smiled at the director. Then he told Qin Guan in a high voice. \"Your turn, my friend. Catch it!\"</p><br/><p>He suddenly threw him the key. The key fell in his hand with a beautiful curve. Kim Cattrall grimaced when she noticed Qin Guan's outfit. The boy will fail.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei was looking on as the crew was looking at Qin Guan in sympathy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled and looked up. Suddenly, Essen saw the Asian actor change completely.</p><br/><p>As a talented Columbia student and the boss of an accounting firm, Qin Guan could even play the role of the US Secretary of Treasury, let alone that of a Wall Street elite.</p><br/><p>With steady steps and a confident smile, Qin Guan got into the car and drove back to the starting point. The door was opened slowly and an intelligent, capable man got out with a smile. It seemed like he had just returned from a golf date. After dinner, he went home leisurely. Even his ordinary jeans looked expensive on his body. They had to be from the latest BOSS collection.</p><br/><p>The key was in his slender fingers. Kim nearly dropped her cup of water on her body.</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s so handsome. I want to date him...\"</p><br/><p>Compared to the previous serious man, this elegant, handsome one met the standards of a mature woman.</p><br/><p>\"Listen to me, director. I think this one is better.\"</p><br/><p>She pulled at Essen\u2019s sleeve excitedly. \"He looks like those rich men on Wall Street. He looks both handsome and rich!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nearly slipped at the entrance of the apartment. Are you praising me?</p><br/><p>Qu remained silent as Kim talked, raising her eyelids to have a look at the actress. She had won a Golden Globe in 2002, and she was one of the best actresses in the series. She played Samantha, a PR manager who was after love and sex.</p><br/><p>She seems to be a master of love in real life as well.</p><br/><p>After hearing her words, Essen made a final decision. Pitt left, looking depressed. Qin Guan got ready at once.</p><br/><p>\"Your first scene will be shot in the evening. Your part will not take much time. Just this evening and the next day. Is that okay for you?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Vivian took advantage of this to take a picture of them. Another perfect photo of my idol.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan rushed into Prof. Martin\u2019s office like a storm.</p><br/><p>\"What are you talking about? You want leave at the beginning of the new semester? Are you daydreaming?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled in a flattering manner. \"Just for a week, sir. One week...\"</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin shook his head. \"Impossible! Don't you want to keep your scholarship and get full marks?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve finished all my elective courses during the last semester.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? You finished all of them in the first semester? Are you kidding me?\"</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin began to type on his computer. Qin Guan was right. He had already passed all the elective courses for his postgraduate degree. He could make further choices on that solid foundation during the new semester.</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin looked at the Asian boy as if at a rare treasure.</p><br/><p>\"Would you be interested in getting a PhD in Finance? If you keep up these scores, I think you could do great in the field of Finance.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless as he heard the passionate old man. If he said no, he would never be able to ask for leave in the future. Besides, he couldn't arrange his schedule at will. Prof. Martin noticed his hesitation and poured oil on the fire.</p><br/><p>\"A PhD student doesn't need to do much homework. If you finish the necessary research and complete your thesis, you can graduate happily without having to show up on campus every day. Besides, you could get to meet government officials and talented people of a higher class from all academic fields.\"</p><br/><p>In an effort to impress Qin Guan, Prof. Martin used his final weapon. \"If you finish all your academic projects independently, you could get a sponsor. This would elevate your popularity, influence and social status.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, I nearly forgot! The green card! Our government would be happy to issue a green card to a talented young man like you!\"</p><br/><p>His voice faded away gradually as he saw Qin Guan shake his head. \"I\u2019m not interested in getting a green card. As far as I know, only big investors get green cards. Plus, when one\u2019s personal assets reach a certain standard, getting citizenship is a piece of cake. I\u2019m happy to be Chinese. My career in America is supported by my compatriots. I\u2019m only interested in having a looser schedule.\"</p><br/><p>\"I have to think about it and discuss the matter with my family.\"</p><br/><p>So there\u2019s still hope?</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin rolled his eyes. I have to look for any short-term profits, if there are not going to be any long-term ones.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, you can consider my proposal. Take it easy. Now let\u2019s get back to the problem at hand. The courses are not so intense during the first two weeks of the new semester, but we don't encourage students to ask for leave without a proper excuse.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grimaced. Who would ask for leave without a proper reason? There is so much homework! The time one spends on homework would be enough to take on a second major.</p><br/><p>He made the wise decision not to contradict his tutor though. Instead, he waited for him to speak.</p><br/><p>\"Considering that your previous short absence had no influence on your studies, I\u2019ll accept your application. But you have to compensate me in some way...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan remained calm. \"Bribery is prohibited at our college.\"</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin looked mad as he took a DV out of a drawer.</p><br/><p>\"Bribery? Rubbish! I just want a short video!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's all?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's all!\"</p><br/><p>\"Deal!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood by the old man consciously. \"What should I do?\"</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin combed his hair in front of a mirror and then cleared his throat. \"Just smile. Leave the rest to me...\"</p><br/><p>He turned on the DV and smiled at the camera solemnly.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, my old friend! It\u2019s Martin! Long time no see\u2026 A new semester has begun. How are things on the other side of the ocean? I\u2019m brilliant! The college assigned two more projects to me. Besides, I\u2019m pleased with my boy Qin Guan. Here he is! Isn\u2019t he your favorite too?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused, but he remained calm, his poker face still in place. Who will see this video? It seems like they know me too!</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin kept singing his own praises as cold sweat covered Qin Guan's forehead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

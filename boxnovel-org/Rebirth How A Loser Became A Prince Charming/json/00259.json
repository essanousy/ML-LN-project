By the time he went out refreshed, Sister Xue was waiting impatiently in the dining hall downstairs. Seldom was Qin Guan so late for dinner.</p><br/><p>When they met, she pulled him inside without a word.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came to a stop and saw his good friend Huang Bo burying his head in food.</p><br/><p>He rushed up to Huang with a smile. It was wonderful to meet a good friend there.</p><br/><p>He sat down next to Huang and asked, \"Hi, bro! How come you\u2019re here? Are you in a show?\"</p><br/><p>Huang looked up happily.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue sighed and pulled out a chair, giving Qin Guan a short explanation.</p><br/><p>\"I had originally found a long show for Huang. It would be finished by the end of the year, but since you were invited to the Silver Eagle Festival, I thought it would be a good chance to promote your popularity and enhance your relations, so I asked Huang to rearrange his schedule and come here. Plans can\u2019t always keep up with changes. After that ceremony, no one dares act rashly. So I decided not to promote him to Wang Jingcao after all.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue warned them seriously, \"This is the last day. Tomorrow we\u2019ll fly back to the capital. You two stay in your rooms. Don't wander around. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Huang had no idea what had happened at the ceremony. He was only focused on the food. Qin Guan had witnessed the farce, so he nodded.</p><br/><p>Then he ran to get food happily. Just when Sister Xue let out a long breath of relief, she saw Wang Jingcao walking up to her.</p><br/><p>Wang was still in professional attire. She greeted Sister Xue with her trademark warm smile. \"I\u2019ve been looking for you. Qin Guan left the hall quickly after the ceremony. I thought he would be in the dining hall.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was suspicious of her and anything she said. She pointed at Huang. \"My actor came to find us after shooting his show. We\u2019ll return to Beijing together tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>Wang didn't care about that. \"Where is Qin Guan? I want to introduce some friends to him.\"</p><br/><p>She pointed to the entrance of the dining hall. Sister Xue saw some actors there, including Li Bingbing.</p><br/><p>Li\u2019s eyes were following Wang around. When she saw Sister Xue, she gestured at her, making a cross with her fingers.</p><br/><p>Seeing the gesture, Sister Xue smiled at Wang. \"Qin Guan might be in the washroom. He\u2019s been having loose bowels today.\"</p><br/><p>Huang looked up in confusion. Sister, I\u2019m trying to eat here.</p><br/><p>Acquaintances always betrayed people. Meanwhile, Qin Guan returned to the table with several dishes piled as high as half a meter. \"Sister Xue, get some food quickly! The organizing committee is really generous. There are lobsters!\" he said enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue looked at him and Wang Jingcao, who had a faint smile on her face. She tried to cover up her lie, \"You should thank Qin Guan, Huang Bo. He\u2019s sick, but he still remembered to get food for you.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Bo looked at her pitifully. \"Thank you...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan realized something was going on and put the dishes in front of Huang. \"Here you are.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Jingcao smiled. If Qin Guan hates personal gain, I won\u2019t force him to do anything. In this circle, money is everything. I\u2019ll tolerate him for his perfect appearance.</p><br/><p>She stood up with a warm smile and patted Qin Guan on the shoulder. \"Have a good rest. I just wanted to introduce some friends to you. They are in the dining room over there. We can leave it for later though. Maybe once we\u2019re back in the capital?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. \"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>Satisfied, Wang led her actors around the corner and disappeared towards the corridor.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his senses and exchanged a glance with Sister Xue. He sat down and then caught sight of Huang Bo. \"Hey! That\u2019s my lobster!\"</p><br/><p>Huang was feasting on his lobsters.</p><br/><p>The next day, the weather was sunny. They flew back to the capital, leaving the city behind them. Did that mean that the influence of the Silver Eagle Festival was gone?</p><br/><p>Rest assured, the event had not benefited Qin Guan or anybody else, as all the media had remained silent about the festival.</p><br/><p>Only some brave websites had published the news. It seemed like everyone had suffered a collective memory loss.</p><br/><p>The hot news about Qin Guan and Liu Jia were also buried in the strange deep waters.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia had kept a photo in which Qin Guan was handing the jacket to her. It would be her most beautiful memory forever.</p><br/><p>Her agent covered her face with the newspaper, leaving Liu smiling to herself like silly. That was the latest newspaper. There was only one line with small characters at the corner of the entertainment section.</p><br/><p>\"The 19th Silver Eagle Festival Concluded Successfully.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

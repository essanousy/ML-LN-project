Attracted by their large poster, young people entered the store because of their admiration for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"This must be the outfit he was wearing in Milan!\"</p><br/><p>\"It looks lovely with those mysterious Chinese characters...\"</p><br/><p>\"It's both cheap and fashionable. My mom could fit into the larger size!\"</p><br/><p>J Clothing, which was famous for its first-rate quality and reasonable prices, began selling to foreigners, regardless of the purchasing group. During the following weekends, their stores in New York experienced a golden era.</p><br/><p>Sitting in the warehouse, Guo Nuoyan read through the sales reports excitedly, calculating the company's total capital flow in the future.</p><br/><p>Tomorrow I will have a discussion with Liu Tianxia and withdraw part of the capital to open two more stores in Los Angeles.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's career as a model was flourishing. Meanwhile, the news about Milan spread to China, causing some people to discover Ye Dong.</p><br/><p>Never underestimate the curiosity of Chinese people. To Qin Guan's loyal fans, anyone close to their idol was worth paying attention to.</p><br/><p>Some well-informed people posted material of Qin Guan during the Milan Fashion Week on Haijiao. As they looked at the pictures, they noticed the strong man with the square face.</p><br/><p>\"They seem friendly with each other.\"</p><br/><p>\"He is not a member of Qin Guan's team or a staff member of the organizing committee.\"</p><br/><p> \"He looks like a Chinese official...\"</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the forum, followed by denial.</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! He is too young to be an official. He must be Qin Guan's classmate abroad or something.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone jumped to that conclusion subconsciously. It was Ye Dong's demeanor that misled the girls.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang and Li Jie, who were always up to date with their roommates, were shocked by the photos.</p><br/><p>When did Ye Dong go abroad and get together with our influential man? Does his director know about this?</p><br/><p>Ye's immediate superior, who had been his senior at college, was speechless when he saw the photos. His capable man had been exposed to the public in Milan. It was him who had asked Ye to contact Qin Guan. Outstanding young men living in foreign countries could be used tentatively. Everybody was responsible for helping their motherland after all.</p><br/><p>Before he could come back to his senses, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, this is Yan Cheng\u2026 Oh, director. It's you!\"</p><br/><p>\"I saw the photos in Milan, Yan Cheng. That young man has impressed me. He's a very smart guy. I heard that you sent him to Europe one month ago? The guys from the China Textile Industry Association are waiting for our response.\"</p><br/><p>\"The enterprises could operate independently, but the government should grant them some conveniences. It is our duty after all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes!\" Yan Cheng sat up right unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\"I was planning on sending you a report, sir. Ye was laughing happily in the photo because he had good news. Ten minutes ago, he sent me an email to report his achievements in Europe...\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, orders. Large orders... According to my estimation, they will take up about 20% of the annual raw material production of high-end clothing in the country.\"</p><br/><p>His director remained calm on the other end of the line, but Yan's tone got higher.</p><br/><p>\"We'll keep making persistent efforts. You want him to station himself in Europe and start an agency in charge of the clothing industry? He just graduated from college one year ago\u2026 What do you think?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, you are right. We should bring in fresh blood and integrate with international parties. You are making a lot of sense.\"</p><br/><p>The director was delighted. \"Younger people can understand the fashion market well. We have just opened our door to international buyers. If we just work silently without publicizing things, it will be easy to tumble though,\" he warned his subordinate.</p><br/><p>\"Ye is a smart guy. He knows how things work abroad. He made the right decision in asking help from Qin Guan. He knows the high-end market really well. We could create a shortcut for Chinese producers this way.\"</p><br/><p>Yan Cheng nodded again and again at the man's words.</p><br/><p>Twenty minutes later, he hung up.</p><br/><p>\"You are getting promoted fast, bastard...\" he murmured as he looked at the photo on his screen.</p><br/><p>If Ye could organize the agency abroad, he would be in charge of all the work there. It didn't matter if he returned home or stayed abroad. Either way, Ye would have a smooth future ahead of him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She took her finger out of her mouth and pointed at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Mommy, the green fairy!\"</p><br/><p>The cashier cried out in alarm. \"I know who he is! He's the fairy from the book! It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>The woman looked both scared and confused. She pulled the little girl closer to her as the girl giggled.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan blew the little girl a kiss. She was the first one to recognize him after all. The kiss amused the little girl.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that his kindness was not reciprocated. The mother did not appreciate his gesture like a Chinese mother would have. She hid the girl behind her body.</p><br/><p>\"Stay away from my daughter!\"</p><br/><p>By that time, Qin Guan had been pulled out of the shop, the door blocking his view. It was the first time he had been treated with such hostility. He was completely dazed as Cong Nianwei sneered at him.</p><br/><p>\"This is America, not China. There are too many cases of child molestation and kidnapping every year. Any familiarity between adults and strange children is forbidden by the law, and the child's parents have the right to call the police.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shrank back in confusion. \"How come you're so familiar with American laws?\"</p><br/><p>\"You have been arrested once, remember? It's become a joke around campus, so some students from the Law Department started making plans so you could avoid a similar situation. It was hard for me to turn down a kind offer like that. When I visited their class, I found the topic very interesting, so I began to study law in my spare time.\"</p><br/><p>How fortunate I am! Other girlfriends go shopping in their free time, but my girlfriend studies instead.</p><br/><p>His lovely girlfriend was worth a dinner at the BOULEY restaurant. It was the only upscale restaurant in New York where customers didn't have to dress formally. Plus, it served French food.</p><br/><p>The French cook there was a huge fan of Kaiseki Ryori. Qin Guan booked a table for two through his firm.</p><br/><p>\"Come on, let's go out for dinner!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei smiled warmly in response.</p><br/><p>The old-fashioned restaurant insisted on a standard menu of five dishes, ignoring the fact that some Americans had a bigger appetite.</p><br/><p>The boss had figured out the perfect plan. He had placed a large wooden counter in the middle of the hall with dozens of French loaves.</p><br/><p>If the food didn't satisfy the patrons, they could just head there with their plates. There was a waiter standing there who would cut loaves into pieces till the patrons ate their fill.</p><br/><p>As a result, the restaurant was renowned for the sweet smell of its bread.</p><br/><p>A waiter led Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei to their reserved table. When they took their seats, the waiter handed them two menus.</p><br/><p>There were only two options, Meal A and Meal B. This was handy for people who had a hard time making up their minds.</p><br/><p>The customers were waiting eagerly to try the strange dishes.</p><br/><p>The first dish was really small. It was a crisp slice of konjac flour with a spoonful of truffle. If it wasn't for its sweet taste, Qin Guan would have complained about its price. Despite the lack of sugar, the dish brought out the original taste of the food. It was a perfect combination.</p><br/><p>The second dish looked like an ice-cream ball. Cong Nianwei nearly burst into laughter. Although Qin Guan had never tried such a smooth tomato paste, he still felt like crying. The small portion had left him unsatisfied. Even its good taste couldn't comfort a foodie like him.</p><br/><p>The experienced boss realized that the familiar patron was on the verge of exploding. The young man lifted his arm, clenching his fist firmly.</p><br/><p>\"Waiter!\"</p><br/><p>Before the boss could head over personally, a waitress who had been admiring Qin Guan for a long time rushed over, wearing a sultry white apron.</p><br/><p>\"What can I do for you, sir?\"</p><br/><p>Her black skirt, white apron and black leggings made her look like a maid.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't look up. He was very concentrated on the menu. His slender finger pointed to the dishes one after the other as he spoke clearly, attracting the other patrons' attention.</p><br/><p>Dear everyone, here is the new book of Kiki, my lovely editors.

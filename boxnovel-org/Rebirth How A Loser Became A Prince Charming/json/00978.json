The Chinese media were not as kind, though. They wanted to have a heated discussion.</p><br/><p> As a result, titles such as \"The ugliest wax figure at Madame Tussauds\" and \"The real and the fake one\" could be seen everywhere. Unfortunately, the figure itself couldn't withstand a careful survey. Qin Guan's fans got really angry.</p><br/><p> They posted articles everywhere online, arguing over the equal treatment of every star and blaming the poor ability of the sculpture on the craftsman. The Madame Tussauds staff felt offended. This was an excellent piece of their museum, but it was still a sculpture, and as such, it couldn't be compared to the real person.</p><br/><p> No sculpture could depict the charm of Qin Guan's actions. The museum still had to issue a statement to comfort the fans, though. This was the only real sculpture of Qin Guan in the world after all.</p><br/><p> The fans were reminded of that. They rarely had a chance to touch the real person, so this sculpture was a precious chance for them to take pictures with Qin Guan. Thus, all the Madame Tussauds Museums were flooded by visitors. Local fans went there almost every day, while tourists scheduled a visit during their trips. </p><br/><p> People took pictures with the figure one by one, turning it into a new attraction.</p><br/><p> There were some more striking news awaiting Qin Guan, though. As he left the UK and travelled to the US to attend the premiere of \"I Am Legend\", he found out that both \"I Am Legend and \"Night At The Museum\"\" had been nominated for a Saturn Award. The Teen Choice Awards and MTV Movie Awards also sang Qin Guan's praises.</p><br/><p> The dates of the ceremonies were quite close to each other, which annoyed Qin Guan, as there was still a lot of work waiting for him back at home.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan gradually slowed down after his grand slam and turned to his family and everyday life. He just wanted to enjoy life while he was still young, so he asked his agents to attend the ceremonies for him. He didn't care about the striking titles that would appear in the papers the next day.</p><br/><p> The first screening of \"I Am Legend\" received positive feedback, and the box office of the opening day reached 40 million dollars. In three days, the 40 million turned into 90 million.</p><br/><p> According to professional analysts, the movie's global box office would reach 500 million. With a little luck, it could even reach 600 million.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was in a good mood as he enjoyed his breakfast at the hotel and picked up the latest newspaper.</p><br/><p> \"The last survivor on Earth is played by the last real star in the world. Nothing interesting.\"</p><br/><p> This is not a famous newspaper. I should read another one.</p><br/><p> \"It's Qin Guan, not the film itself, that deserves your money...\"</p><br/><p> Detroit News?</p><br/><p> Qin Guan waved over the waiter.</p><br/><p> \"Excuse me? What other newspapers do you have?\"</p><br/><p> \"Chicago Reader, The Hollywood Reporter, Global Mail, Variety Show, News Daily, USA Today\u2026 If none of these satisfy you, we could get you any newspaper you like.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan nodded kindly. \"Thank you. I want them all!\"</p><br/><p> \"One minute, please.\"</p><br/><p> The waiter left and returned quickly with a pile of newspapers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

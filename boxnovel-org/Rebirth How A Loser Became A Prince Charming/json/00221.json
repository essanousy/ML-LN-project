Both of them recalled the scene in the parking lot after the party.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei sighed. \"Tell me, what happened? I promoted Qin Guan to Fang, so where did Shao come from? Tell me the truth! Don't tell me any rubbish about inferior capabilities.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? You recommended Qin Guan to Fang?\" Sister Xue was surprised.</p><br/><p>\"Do you think she would ask for the phone number of an agent otherwise? There are plenty of agents clustering around her.\"</p><br/><p>\"We were schoolmates at Harvard. I knew you would attend the party, so I called her to recommend Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qin Guan exchanged another glance. How can I explain that her schoolmate wanted to f*ck me? It's hard to say this out loud!</p><br/><p>Qu smiled and said, \"Xue, leave us alone.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was confused, but she obeyed. She went out and sat down on a couch to rest.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan's fan, Qu\u2019s secretary, gave her a cup of coffee, the shades of the chief editor's office suddenly went down.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat awkwardly on the couch, the glass wall just behind him. Qu was half-kneeling on the armrest, pulling the rope of the shades.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to shrink against the couch. Qu's full bosom was just in front of his eyes. Black lace was visible through her white shirt.</p><br/><p>Qu threw away the rope and opened her pink lips. \"I know her well. Did she act like this that day?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she pulled loose the prim bun on her head.</p><br/><p>Long black hair with natural curls poured down. Qin Guan could smell jasmine. A strand of naughty hair gently touched his face, making him move to the center of the couch in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Qu smoothed her hair down and took off her golden-framed glasses. She stared at Qin Guan with misty eyes. \"Did she act like this?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan realized her pupils were hazel, shining mysteriously like amber.</p><br/><p>Confused, he started shaking his head gently. What does she want?</p><br/><p>\"What did she do then? Tell me.\"</p><br/><p>Her voice gradually lowered, her trim fingernails reaching for the buttons on Qin Guan's shirt. The first one on his neckline was unfastened easily.</p><br/><p>\"Stop! Stop! Stop! I\u2019ll tell you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan told her everything, although she seemed like a completely different person. As he talked fast, his words were like bullets being shot from a machine gun.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s what happened. Your friend left after getting rejected. I don't know what happened afterwards, but I saw Shao driving Fang's car in the parking lot. They left together.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan dared not move. He could smell the Chanel on her body.</p><br/><p>\"Alas! So many years have passed, but she remains the same. She can lure any man to her bed.\" Satisfied with Qin Guan's story, Qu stood up and walked back to her desk leisurely, leaving a hint with her body, reminding Qin Guan that what had just happened had not been an illusion.</p><br/><p>She pulled her hair back and put on her glasses. She was a professional again. \"I misjudged you. You are such an honorable young man. It's hard to tell from your appearance.\"</p><br/><p>You underestimated me. Do I seem like some random person? Qin Guan thought to himself proudly.</p><br/><p>\"I thought no domestic model could resist an offer from her. But what do I see now? You\u2019re like a panda sitting in front of me. Are you an idiot, Qin Guan? Did you have to bribe someone to get your diploma?\" Qu\u2019s attitude suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>\"That offer could have helped you so much! You would have to struggle for a shorter time. Or were you just afraid that she would ask for something more in the future? You are turning 20 this year. Don\u2019t be so naive!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shrugged. Actually, I\u2019m already 56. You\u2019d be scared to death if I told you the truth. Staring at her with a sincere expression in his eyes, he switched to actor mode. \"I know you want me to advance in my career and gave me a chance to soar up into the sky, but I have principles. I would never betray my girlfriend. Besides, I can use my looks to get other things I want. I had to be responsible for both me and Ms. Fang.\"</p><br/><p>His young handsome face was shining with a devout, fervent light.</p><br/><p>Qu\u2019s eyes twinkled, as if she was holding something back. She took a pile of paperwork from a drawer and threw it to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, principled man! I\u2019ll give you a chance on your abilities alone. This brand is looking for an ambassador in Asia. Go to the audition!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

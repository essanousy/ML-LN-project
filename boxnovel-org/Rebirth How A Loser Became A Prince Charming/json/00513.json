Taking advantage of the riot, they all sneaked away.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, I wasn\u2019t finished! Don\u2019t be late tomorrow. What about you two? Can you return to the hotel?\"</p><br/><p>The three ladies left the restaurant as soon as possible, while Qin Guan, Cong Nianwei and Qu went to their hotel hurriedly.</p><br/><p>After taking a shower, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei lay down in bed, their shoulders touching. A soft light was reflected on the quilt.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't like those three. Neither the older one, nor the younger ones.\"</p><br/><p>\"Me neither.\"</p><br/><p>\"Can you turn down the job?\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem. Can I ask you a question though? I have cooperated with many actresses before. Why did you dislike them in particular?\"</p><br/><p>\"They laughed at my boobs...\"</p><br/><p>\"Good answer.\" Qin Guan got up to answer the phone, hiding his smile in the process. My girlfriend is so cute.</p><br/><p>Qu was shouting at him from the other end of the line. Qin Guan hung up and returned to bed.</p><br/><p>\"Qu said we can turn down the job if we are willing to pay the consequences. Plus, we would have two days to ourselves in Los Angeles!\"</p><br/><p>\"How much would you lose?\"</p><br/><p>\"200,000 dollars.\"</p><br/><p>\"You have to get up early tomorrow. You can\u2019t be late for the shooting. I\u2019ll come with you, just to be safe.\"</p><br/><p>He was so lucky to have such a reasonable girlfriend.</p><br/><p>The accident the previous day was nothing for them. They were living a simple life, so they had no idea about the influence of those three ladies in America.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, the newsboys were shuttling around the city. Unlike the residents of the bustling city, the people in the suburbs had just opened their eyes.</p><br/><p>The Los Angeles Times was the highest-selling newspaper in the city. It always published real-time news about celebrities, but this was the first time it featured a full-page headline.</p><br/><p> \"Three female stars competing over Best Actor Award Winner.\"</p><br/><p>On the picture under the headline, Madonna was wiping Qin Guan's mouth, while Britney Spears and Paris Hilton were sitting on either side of him. Cong Nianwei, his real girlfriend, was just a blurry figure in the photo. In the other photos, the readers could see the three of them clearly. By then, they had already left the site.</p><br/><p>As the king of gossip, \"The Sun\" had also published a report, although not a very detailed one. The photo of the three women leaving had been highlighted, and the titles went along the lines of \"Asian Best Actor Winner abandoning three American girls over his true love. Which is better: a pretty girl or a mature woman?\"</p><br/><p>The report was full of unreliable speculations.</p><br/><p>Sleeping in his hotel, Qin Guan had no idea about the news, which had reached thousands of households and shocked fans all over the country. In several hours, he had become the rumored boyfriend of the three famous stars.</p><br/><p>The shooting location had nothing to do with the affair. There were no newspapers, no beach, sea or coconut trees around. It was actually a studio. Unlike the large stages built for hot singers and dancers, the set looked like the office of a gangster.</p><br/><p>There was a big brown desk, a large crystal ashtray, some \"Godfather\" cabinets, and a black leather couch in the room.</p><br/><p>The dresser was carefully working on Qin Guan\u2019s face. The Asian model was welcomed warmly by the crew. His black hair was perfect for the role. After getting permed, it was sculpted into a vintage hairstyle.</p><br/><p>Qu opened Qin Guan\u2019s clothing case, shocking the prop master. It was full of Armani Haute Couture. The model had to be very successful.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went out of the fitting room, but the two singers took their time in coming out. Qin Guan presented himself in the most shocking manner.</p><br/><p>He arranged the sleeves of his white shirt, whispering to Cong Nianwei in his most gentle voice. He was wearing a vintage British black suit, the straight pants reaching his shoes elegantly.</p><br/><p>His short hair had been curled. His eyes were fixed on his girlfriend, full of love and affection. The corner of his mouth was raised in a smile. Qin Guan was in a good mood, despite the fact that it was about 30 degrees in the studio and he was wearing an autumn outfit.</p><br/><p>\"I like him...\" Britney murmured to herself, covering her heart, which had been shot by Cupid\u2019s arrows. Madonna was staring at Qin Guan's long legs. The expression in her eyes was very intense.</p><br/><p>The prop master moved a screen away to reveal the set.</p><br/><p>A music video was much more complicated than an advertisement. It required editing, background music, and many other things. Fortunately, Qin Guan was only an actor. He would just perform. That was simple enough for him, considering he was a professional actor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

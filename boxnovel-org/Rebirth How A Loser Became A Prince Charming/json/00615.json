Yan Cheng read through the thick pile of orders that had been sent through fax. And lucky...</p><br/><p>Actually, Ye had borrowed some luck from Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was panting as he ran after his girlfriend in the direction of the classroom. He was wearing a hoodie and a hat instead of formal attire.</p><br/><p> He would be taking the seasonal examinations that day. As a punctual girl, Cong Nianwei had only been delayed by her boyfriend.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan had returned to New York, he had realized he had become the mascot of the community. Warm neighbors gave him flowers and home-made pies, so he had to return home again and again.</p><br/><p>Paris Hilton had also contributed to that. Before leaving, she had pulled a prank on him. She had sent posters and T-shirts with his picture to all the families in the community as an apology for the inconvenience she had caused them.</p><br/><p>They had all had to bear with reporters and fans hiding in their property and moving trucks creating a traffic jam.</p><br/><p>She wanted to apologize for the inconvenience to her temporary neighbors. Only when she left did everyone find out that a celebrity had been living in that student apartment.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the vampire from the Armani advertisement, the playboy from \"Sex and the City\" and Chuck Barris, but he was also their neighbor.</p><br/><p>As soon as he returned to New York, people started greeting him everywhere.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei rushed to their separate classrooms. The seasonal examination was about to start.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan rushed into the classroom panting. He saw the cold face of the invigilator in front of him. As soon as the man saw Qin Guan clearly, he forced a smile.</p><br/><p>He had recognized him. The guy was the God of Wealth at Columbia. He was bringing in donations not just for the Finance Department, but for other departments as well.</p><br/><p>People had formed a group to comfort Prof. Martin and take pleasure in his sorrow.</p><br/><p>In Prof. Martin's opinion, Qin Guan was the laziest student at Columbia. If Qin Guan's grades declined, he would lead a miserable life in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took his seat. He had prepared well for the exam, as it would decide whether he would go on holiday in October.</p><br/><p>Columbia insisted on traditional answering sheets, so the students were familiar with the smell of ink.</p><br/><p>The sheet was full of questions. To a student without full attendance, that mark would play an important role in their final grade.</p><br/><p>\"Cheers!\" Qin Guan shouted to himself in his mind before he began his test.</p><br/><p>Basic theory, practical application, and comprehensive analysis\u2026 Everything was easy to answer. In one hour, he had finished a sheet that would take the others two hours to complete. His classmates had become inured to this peculiarity, as the same scene was repeated every time during their exams.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan handed in his sheets and left. He didn't forget to pay a visit to Prof. Martin's office. He set a keychain with the symbol of a Milan soccer team on his desk.</p><br/><p>Fake fans couldn't distinguish between International Milan and A.C. Milan, but he collected team memorabilia of national soccer teams.</p><br/><p>The old man was easy to flatter.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to suck up to him so he would return to China in October. He was doing it partly for Director Zhang Yimou and partly for the appeal.</p><br/><p>No one would dare turn down a promotional film for the Olympics. Qin Guan would be able to go home with Cong Nianwei. It was time for Liu Xiaoyang to help him clean up his apartment in Beijing.</p><br/><p>His plan went well. Even without the bonus of full attendance, he still ranked as the No.1 student of the department. The college administration approved his vacation for the donors' sakes.</p><br/><p>After a long journey, he had finally returned to China. He and Cong Nianwei were walking clumsily in the terminal building with their luggage. There was a crowd waiting for them ahead.</p><br/><p>This was all Li Jie's fault. He had been boasting to junior girls at a public gathering.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

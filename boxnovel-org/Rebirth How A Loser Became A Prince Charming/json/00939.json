I remember your smell! Never cross my path again, or I'll... run away.</p><br/><p>On the way back, Qin Guan kept laughing in the car, while Wang was wondering about something.</p><br/><p>He had a good cooperation with that dog in \"I Am Legend\". Why did he have to show his true colors again?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, no one could understand animals.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qin Guan reached Los Angeles, he headed to the Staples Sports Center, where the 2007 Grammy Awards would be held. CBS would broadcast the event live from 20:00 to 23:30.</p><br/><p>The success of the Grammys was largely owed to CBS's vigorous promotion. The network had turned an unknown music event into the Oscars of the music circle. The rest of its success lay in the prestige of the Grammys, which were awarded by the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.</p><br/><p>The judges had to go through a strict selection process. Each one had to be a singer, performer, songwriter, composer, conductor, photographer, author or music video producer with at least six published albums in order to qualify for an application.</p><br/><p>One also had to fit the event into their tight schedule. If needed, they had to show up to vote for as long as possible.</p><br/><p>Did that final recognition add something to one's resume?</p><br/><p>Absolutely not!</p><br/><p>In order to achieve fairness, the organizers chose 150 judges from different fields. The evaluation of some inferior awards was possibly connected to the selection.</p><br/><p>What would one be proud of then?</p><br/><p>There were many legendary musicians around, so newcomers had to be careful and humble with their votes.</p><br/><p>No one knew the results until the last minute. Even the judges did not know. The awards were counting on the public's trust.</p><br/><p>The ceremony was a celebration of music. Even a large stadium couldn't hold the crazy fans.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was sitting in the front rows, sandwiched between other stars so he could avoid exposure. Lang Lang was seated next to him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had taken advantage of the situation to get a couple of seats for the musicians working for his firm. After a fierce battle, Gao Xiaosong had won that precious chance.</p><br/><p>Gao had been smiling like an idiot when he got the invitation. This was a hard-won opportunity for him. Only musicians, celebrities, reporters and producers were invited to the Grammys.</p><br/><p>The organizing committee did not sell tickets to the public for security reasons. If someone did not attend the ceremony though, their invitation was sold through various channels.</p><br/><p>Two hours before the ceremony, people were still looking for tickets on Qin Guan's website. His fans had been informed that he would be attending the ceremony with a friend, so they were talking about the news excitedly.</p><br/><p>\"I'm in Los Angeles. I'll go to the stadium and see if I can get a ticket.\"</p><br/><p>\"It must be really expensive. Be reasonable.\"</p><br/><p>\"How much could it cost?\"</p><br/><p>\"Over 1,500 dollars. And that's an average price.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan does not belong to the music circle. He will be sitting with the celebrities. You won't be able to get close to him. Would it even be worth the money?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

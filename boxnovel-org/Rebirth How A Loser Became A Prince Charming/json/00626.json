During dinner, people expanded their connections and made new friends.</p><br/><p>After exchanging a few words, Qin Guan caught up with his old friends. They had prospered during the past couple of years. Their small company had succeeded not just in the development of the western regions, but also in entertaining the residents of the capital.</p><br/><p>They had established a chain KTV called Haoledi. Qin Guan's value had been rising in the process, but his total assets had reached a debt of tens of millions of yuan.</p><br/><p>This was because his previous investment had not succeeded yet and his next projects had to be expanded. In other words, everything was in place except for the capital. However, many banks were begging to give them a loan to benefit from their success.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a sip of tea and shouted in the direction of the door, \"Mou Xiaoliu! Come here!\"</p><br/><p>Mou ran over right away with a reluctant Huang Jiajia.</p><br/><p>\"What for?\" Her sparkling eyes had remained the same.</p><br/><p>\"Are you in the Credit Department? Is that guy your direct supervisor? I will help you avoid a retaliation. I have a share in that company, so I call the shots.\"</p><br/><p>The other guys did not object. They were used to hearing Qin Guan's opinion on financial problems. They all nodded in unison.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at the girl. \"Your director failed, but you succeeded in getting the loan. Tomorrow, these three guys will go to the bank for you.\"</p><br/><p>Mou smiled like silly. \"That's great!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to Huang Jiajia. \"What does that supercilious look on your face mean? Why aren't you greeting your former tutor?\"</p><br/><p>The girl burst into tears.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at Cong Nianwei nervously. \"I wasn't bullying her!\"</p><br/><p>\"I thought you would never be kind to me!\" Huang Jiajia cried out.</p><br/><p>A warm hand caressed her head, making her cry even louder. Mou felt jealous as the hand caressed her head with the same long-lost warmth and tolerance.</p><br/><p>I have to cheer up. Senior Qin is offering his support to me.</p><br/><p>The guests dispersed as the moonlight was reflected in the hall like water.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had some sips of wine, which was something he didn't do often. He didn't have to work the next day though, so he could afford to drink.</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei parted ways. One of them headed for Kekexili, while the other would be in charge of their parents' arrival on the weekend. Both were very difficult jobs.</p><br/><p>The two film crews started filming at the same time, which caused a lot of trouble for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Both \"Ke Ke Xi Li\" and \"A World Without Thieves\" were being produced by Huayi and included scenes that had to be filmed on the plateau. That was the main shooting site, so the train had to be driven down from a height of 4,700 meters above sea level. This would save everyone time, money and work.</p><br/><p>Feng had shamelessly stolen Qin Guan from Lu Chuan after all.</p><br/><p>The jeeps were climbing up the plateau one after the other. They had to carry up all the supplies, including the props, the costumes, some food and medicine.</p><br/><p>This was no fun and games. It was actually a battle with cruel nature.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would play a minor role in the film, but he still had to learn about the shooting methods of Chinese directors.</p><br/><p>Wang Baoqiang saw Qin Guan as a member of his family. He kept following Qin Guan around, his arm locked around his.</p><br/><p>\"When did you come home, Brother?\" Qin Guan was having some lunch during a rest stop.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know that I was selected by Director Feng himself? Do you think this film will make me famous?\" Qin Guan was sleeping at a small hotel.</p><br/><p>\"There are so many stars in this film, Brother! Liu Dehua, Ge You... I'm afraid of them. Yesterday, Liu Ruoying smiled at me...\" Qin Guan was in the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Why aren't you afraid of me? I'm a two-time Best Actor Award winner!</p><br/><p>One had to forgive the simple boy. In his opinion, only people who appeared frequently on television could be considered stars.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

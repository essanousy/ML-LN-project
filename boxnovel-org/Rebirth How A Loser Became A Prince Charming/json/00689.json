They are all from different countries, just like the UN, but they have an unerring ability to spot talent. After expressing their different opinions, they decided to offer me the lead. I want to thank them for their appreciation and love, as well as the trust they put in me. The audience knows that this was quite an unusual film compared to the films I have acted in before in terms of plot, characterization and shooting methods.\"</p><br/><p>\"It was definitely a challenging test for my acting skills. I would also like to express my appreciation to the senior actors that participated in the film, who have all dedicated their lives to indie films. We should make some space for them on the stage. They make all European film festivals better. They have been the wheels of progress on our journey. This award belongs to the US. I would like to share my profits with all the silent contributors.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, those contributors should be no more than five, and the amount can be up to 100,000 at the most. Otherwise, I'll be suffering a loss.\"</p><br/><p>The audience burst into laughter as Qin Guan put the award down and started counting on his fingers.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue buried her face in her hands, which were dressed in white gloves with pearls. She knew Qin Guan very well. He is not joking! He means it!</p><br/><p>\"I would also like to thank the producers and the distributing companies. Our film has not been officially in theaters yet, but this award can help you relax in advance!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised the Silver Bear again amid a round of applause and catcalls.</p><br/><p>\"I'm not trying to flatter the organizing committee, but I wouldn't complain if it worked. Our film will be a huge success thanks to this award.\"</p><br/><p>The buyers of the distributing rights were ecstatic under the stage. Good boy! Well done! The box office will be fantastic thanks to this award!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waited until the audience calmed down.</p><br/><p>\"My first visit to Berlin was last year for the same award ceremony. At the same time this year, I'm in the same theater and same position, holding the same award. Only the audience is different.\"</p><br/><p>\"I, Qin Guan...\" He took a sincere bow before the audience. \"... am grateful to the Berlin Film Festival for giving the same award to the same person for two consecutive years. I recognize its fairness and justice, and I can see why it is considered the strictest international film festival.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your approval of me and my performance. Thank you for relating to this story of a father's love. Your love for the film makes me happier than your approval of me!\"</p><br/><p>His speech drew tears from the directors.</p><br/><p>\"The boy is really kind.\"</p><br/><p>\"The bastard is so sensational...\"</p><br/><p>The four directors started crying their eyes out. The people around them looked at them with a touched expression in their eyes. This was an emotional catharsis for the indie filmmakers and the joy they found in their work.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan looked up to the main camera with a big smile.</p><br/><p>\"I want to thank all the members of my studio, Sister Xue and Sister Qu. You have always been taking care of me. As for the person waiting for me at home... See? This is the third one! We'll fill that shelf soon! Just wait for me!\"</p><br/><p>He jumped up in joy before the stunned audience. Then he diverted their attention with his conclusion.</p><br/><p>\"I will end my long speech here. Everyone must be anxious to find out who the winner of the Best Film Award is, so I'll surrender the stage to our dear host, Runco!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone shouted all at once, the earth-shaking sound echoing around the hall. The ceremony had originally been a bit dull due to the absence of most superstars, but Qin Guan had brightened things up.</p><br/><p>The director burst into excited tears backstage. He hugged everybody he came across and shouted, \"You can't sneer at us anymore! Look at the powerful Berlin Festival, you bastards! You'll be shocked by the ratings tomorrow!\"</p><br/><p>He was a director with dignity, ideals and ambitions, so the audience ratings of the grand ceremony would make him very popular. Qin Guan's award would be proof of his directing ability.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan got off the stage with the award, the audience cheered on. The next award had made everyone wild with joy.</p><br/><p>\"The Best Director Award goes to\u2026 Ki-Duk Kim and 'Samaria Girls'!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

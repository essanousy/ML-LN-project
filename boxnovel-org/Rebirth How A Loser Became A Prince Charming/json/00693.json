Both his success and failure would be attractive to the readers.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had succeeded, so the title was \"Best Actor Again\".</p><br/><p>He felt a little ashamed as he looked at his familiar face and the shameless title. Thanks to his strong mentality though, he was able to recover from the impact of the magazine.</p><br/><p>The newsstand owner was counting his stock in the small room, while Qin Guan was standing in a long gray windcoat outside. He opened the magazine leisurely.</p><br/><p>\"The award-winning actor from China started his career in America.\"</p><br/><p>The Americans were boasting about their own country again. If it wasn't for his films in America, the magazine wouldn't have dedicated two full pages on an Asian model.</p><br/><p>\"His acting skills are a perfect combination of oriental fineness and unrestrained occidental body language. His strong abilities and performance before the camera make him extremely charming.\"</p><br/><p>\"America may be the reason for his success though. If he had not come to America, he wouldn't have made a breakthrough in the film industry. In an effort to get to know the actor better, our editor had the honor of reviewing his films in China.\"</p><br/><p>\"Forgive me, but I laughed for an entire day. His acting skills at the time had been far from good. His lines were hard to understand, and he only portrayed supporting characters that suffered immediate death. If you are interested, you could buy some copies through your Chinese friends.\"</p><br/><p>The critic must have done extensive research on Qin Guan. His Chinese sucked though. For example, \"Maids In The Red Mansion\" had been translated as \"Maids Working In Luxurious Gardens\", and \"Legend Of The Swordsman\" had been summed up as \"A man abandoned by his first love becomes famous with the help of his noble wife\".</p><br/><p>Qin Guan burst into laughter. The author was smart enough to omit \"Demi-Gods and Demi-Demons\". Maybe the number of his roles had driven him mad.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's laughter startled the newsstand owner, who turned around in surprise. The man on the cover of the magazine was standing before him, holding that very magazine. The golden sunshine hit his shoulders. He was much more handsome than the guy in the picture.</p><br/><p>Now the man realized why that magazine issue had become a bestseller. He suddenly recalled the comments of the readers.</p><br/><p>It was true! The Asian star was really a student at Columbia. The students had not been boasting.</p><br/><p>He felt warmth in his heart as he looked at Qin Guan's poster on the wall of his newsstand. Actually, he was also a fan of his. As an inarticulate man though, he had decided to express his love for his idol in a typical way.</p><br/><p>His greatest advantage was his small stand. He started opening magazines and newspapers one by one to show Qin Guan every article there was about him.</p><br/><p>The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Post, VOGUE, Entertainment Weekly...</p><br/><p>Thanks to his latest award, Qin Guan still had a place in the entertainment section of every newspaper and magazine. Qin Guan stopped reading and took out his wallet. He thought that the man was implying that he had been reading without buying anything.</p><br/><p>The newsstand owner finally squeezed a few words between his teeth.</p><br/><p>\"Look! They are all praising you! No one is against you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at the man and kept reading the reports.</p><br/><p>They were not short or poorly written. The pictures and articles about him occupied entire pages.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

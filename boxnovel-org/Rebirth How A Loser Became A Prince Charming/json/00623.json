I want to shoot a film with a sixth-generation director.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Wouldn't that influence your status in the fashion circle?\"</p><br/><p>\"Never.\" Qin Guan raised an eyebrow. \"If you knew what I said at the Milan Fashion Week, you wouldn't be worried about that.\"</p><br/><p>Relieved, Lu Chuan pushed the script towards Qin Guan. \"Take it. The crew is ready. We can start filming anytime you like.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded as Sister Xue put the script away. They turned to the Wang brothers together. Before they could say anything though, Feng Xiaogang cut the ground from under their feet.</p><br/><p>\"I know why they are here. If you accept my offer, I'll tell you.\"</p><br/><p>Feng, who was famous for his big mouth, betrayed them right away.</p><br/><p>\"You must not be aware that they...\" Feng paused and pouted at the brothers, \"They have contacted Columbia Pictures to jointly produce a film with them so the investment risk is smaller. Actually, they just want to cheat the foreigners and release the film overseas.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Sister Xue nodded in unison. They were familiar with that method. Even a film with great potential could bomb at the box office. They preferred to share the risk.</p><br/><p>\"What's the deal with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"They want you for your influence, of course. The investors were hesitant about the indie film, but they changed their minds when they heard that you would be the lead. They have taken 50% of the investment already. They will be in charge of the overseas release.\"</p><br/><p>\"The two brothers promised them that you were planning on shooting some films in Huayi. They were happy about the news, so they decided to support you. They are looking to further increase your appeal.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are a money-making machine. As for me, as an experienced director with good taste, I have to explore new ways to shoot my new film. We have never cooperated before, so I wanted to talk with you as early as I could.\"</p><br/><p>\"If we succeed, my film will do great at the box office. If we don't, at least I will be able to say that I collaborated with an international Best Actor Award winner.\"</p><br/><p> Commercial filmmakers were as cunning as foxes.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qin Guan exchanged a meaningful glance.</p><br/><p> They had a pile of scripts to look at. A small role with a good salary would be the ideal option. The brothers felt at ease, but Zhang Wei Ning and Zhang Yimou frowned. Qin Guan had accepted Lu Chuan's offer, so he would reject the film \"House of Flying Daggers\".</p><br/><p>As leaders of the indie and commercial cinema, both Feng and Lu viewed Zhang's new film unfavorably.</p><br/><p>Due to its plain plot and wrong positioning, the film's only highlight was Zhang Ziyi, who was an actress with great commercial value. Their evaluation was actually very objective.</p><br/><p>When the negotiation was over, Qin Guan returned to the urban area. A group of people were waiting for him at the Jun Wang Fu Restaurant.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was waiting for him there. Everyone who had welcomed them at the airport had been invited. The manager was happy about the party, as it would take him less time and staff to prepare it.</p><br/><p>By the time Qin Guan got out of his car, the pavilion in the garden was already ablaze with lights. This had been done for the safety of the customers, as the restaurant was half a kilometer away from the street.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Xue, are you coming with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, thanks. I'd rather not join the youth.\"</p><br/><p>She left without hesitation, leaving Qin Guan idling before the entrance with his large backpack.</p><br/><p>The cold dishes had already been served. The young students were happy and noisy as the cook got to work. The host had to be an insider of the catering industry, for they had ordered the finest dishes with the most vibrant colors, amazing smells and exquisite flavors.</p><br/><p>Every cook enjoyed serving an experienced foodie.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

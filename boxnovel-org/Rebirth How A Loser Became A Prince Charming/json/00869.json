As the emperor and empress were fighting with hatred, Qin Guan felt a sword impale his body from the back.</p><br/><p>It was his youngest brother, Qin Junyi. The boy was only 14 years old, yet he had killed his eldest brother while he had been lying still in an armchair.</p><br/><p>Blood poured out of Qin Guan's mouth without a word or movement. The prince collapsed, turning his scared face towards the camera.</p><br/><p>What happened next had nothing to do with him. Gong Lee rushed over to Qin Guan with dishevelled hair, her face twisted in sorrow. This was the last hour of his life, so she hugged him with all her strength.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was looking at the ceiling blankly as he confessed to the woman, \"Sorry, it was all my fault.\"</p><br/><p>Then he died in peace.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a long sigh of relief. He thought he had finished his job successfully, when suddenly his head was thrown back, colliding hard against the ground. He had to remain still and elegant throughout everything.</p><br/><p>The shot lasted a full five seconds. When Gong Lee left, the corpse got up to leave with the other figurants.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang shouted at him angrily, \"Qin Guan! What the hell are you doing? Lie back down!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why? I finished my scene. I want to go get my bonus.\"</p><br/><p>\"Nonsense! The empress has grieved for you, but the emperor hasn't. Your corpse can still be of use.\"</p><br/><p>Will everyone take turns grieving for the martyr prince?</p><br/><p>\"See it through to the end!\"</p><br/><p>Thus, after a short break, Qin Guan resumed his strange pose and lay down on the ground again.</p><br/><p>\"Attention! This is Qin Guan's final scene. Let's do our best!\"</p><br/><p>Hey, everyone's gone except for Chow Yun-Fat!</p><br/><p>Chow was a considerate guy. Qin Guan finished his scene as fast as he could. When he received his big bonus, he smiled like a greedy man.</p><br/><p>After one month, the film he had invested so much in was finally finished. Just like with all his other movies, Qin Guan couldn't wait for the celebratory feast. He had been separated from Cong Nianwei for a long time, and Nicholas Tse, his good friend from Hong Kong, was going to get married soon.</p><br/><p>It seemed like his advice had not worked. All Qin Guan could do was send the couple his sincerest blessings. Thus, Qin Guan left the crew without feeling any guilt and got his butt kicked by Zhang Weiping.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't tell Cong Nianwei about his return because he wanted to surprise her. After taking a short break at home, he drove his Cadillac to Cong Nianwei's working place, the Chinese Academy of Design and Research.</p><br/><p>As a traditional institute, the academy had a dwelling district for the staff. Its lawns and trees made it look like a beautiful park.</p><br/><p>After checking in at the entrance, Qin Guan drove to the building where Cong Nianwei worked. There was a bouquet of lilies in the backseat of his car. The tender petals were trembling as the car moved.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had decided to give Cong Nianwei a romantic surprise. He was afraid that their love would fade with distance, which was pretty common in the entertainment and business circle. Qin Guan was too careful to make such a stupid mistake though. No woman could resist a flower bouquet and a handsome man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019d better go. They thought I was a performer, but someone else might think I\u2019m a beggar.</p><br/><p>At home, Qin Guan put the elegant gift in its small container on the dressing table. He always felt like he was forgetting something in the summer. Working the next day would drive that thought out of his mind though.</p><br/><p>In the evening, he replied to Bu Qinglu's email, typing with a single finger. It was something about accounts and statistics. In less than five minutes, Qin Guan had picked up two bugs and replied, drinking iced beer.</p><br/><p>He had made a good beginning, so the work was as simple as drinking water for him.</p><br/><p>Bu was sitting before his computer, lost in thought. He got Qin Guan's reply right away. All he had to do was pretend to be clever in front of the new accountant.</p><br/><p>It was not the first time he would be doing it. The accountant was admiring him more and more by the minute. His reputation as a wise man was rising among the company.</p><br/><p>He replied to Qin Guan\u2019s email with only one word, \"Awesome!\" Qin Guan was considering whether he could ask for a salary increase at an appropriate time.</p><br/><p>The scorching summer was the worst in 100 years, and Qin Guan's car was experiencing obvious problems.</p><br/><p>The air conditioner was in a bad condition, and the leakproofness of the carriage was not so good. Even if Qin Guan turned the air conditioner on to the maximum, he still couldn't feel cool in the car.</p><br/><p>After a full 30 minutes, when it was finally cold inside, Qin Guan had already reached his destination.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to change his car, but he was about to go abroad.</p><br/><p>He got out of the car leisurely and observed the familiar building.</p><br/><p>It was interesting to see VOGUE's headquarters just opposite the ELLE building.</p><br/><p>Great! Maybe COSMOPOLITAN will build a building on the other side.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was taking pleasure in Yin\u2019s misfortune. He put the car key in his pocket and entered the building, wearing his Halley sunglasses.</p><br/><p>The girl at the reception suppressed a scream. She called the chief editor right away.</p><br/><p>As an official fan, she knew everything about Qin Guan. She was different than his nymphomaniac fans in the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>She was also a queen of data, so she had gathered all information concerning Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Up to that point, Qin Guan had participated in 17 shows of different fashion brands, taken pictures for two magazines, and appeared in eight TV advertisements and five posters. He was also the ambassador of a brand.</p><br/><p>The ordinary girl kept all this information in her mind.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan sat in a chair and listened to the girl recite his job history, he began to suspect that even Sister Xue wouldn\u2019t be able to provide the exact dates of his activities that fast.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei, the chief editor of VOGUE, heard their dialogue by accident. She felt it was necessary for her to get a good look at ELLE\u2019s exclusive model and the clear-headed receptionist.</p><br/><p>At the sound of her high heels, the girl suddenly stopped talking. She looked like a snake was staring at her.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan watched the lady slowly walk up to him from behind the receptionist.</p><br/><p>She was a slender woman, 170 centimeters tall. Even though it was blazing summer, she was wearing a stern grey suit and high heels. The collar of her shirt was buttoned up, and her hair was pinned in a meticulous bun behind her head.</p><br/><p>The only accessory she was wearing was the golden chain hanging from her golden-framed glasses, swaying naturally next to her temples as she walked. The swaying chain made her look lively.</p><br/><p>The keen girl realized who was behind her immediately and made a grimace.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei stared at the model, who was wearing a tight white cotton T-shirt and dark blue jeans. His legs were slender. He was as pretty as a painting.</p><br/><p>She blushed and coughed to cover up her awkwardness. \"Qin Guan? My assistant will lead you to the dressing room in a bit and tell you about the do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s of the shoot. Zhang Yuan, follow me.\"</p><br/><p>Trembling in fear, the girl followed the chief editor. At the last moment, she turned around and cast a glance at her prince.</p><br/><p>Bad luck! As long as I get a final glance though, I\u2019ll die without any regrets.</p><br/><p>The door was closed. Qin Guan could do nothing but pray to the gods for the girl. He headed to the assistant\u2019s room instead.</p><br/><p>Interesting! Chief editors of fashion magazines are always experts on the fashion industry. They are hot, bold and unrestrained, filled with knowledge about art and advanced concepts.</p><br/><p>This chief editor had exceeded his imagination though. Judging by her clothes and manner, she seemed like a self-disciplined, strict German woman.</p><br/><p>She should be working on Wall Street.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m looking forward to this new magazine.</p><br/><p>Before he could think more deeply about the problem, he was led into the dressing room.</p><br/><p>There were three rows of mirrors inside. This must have cost a lot.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

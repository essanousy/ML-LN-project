The winners were mad with joy. Their representative was Ning Hao, a director of the sixth generation. Qin Guan was the one who had recommended him to the festival committee.</p><br/><p> At the time, other directors of the same generation had shot one or more famous films, but he had still been a pearl buried in the sand. When his successors had moved out of the 798 Warehouse, which had been like a shelter for the poor artists, he had stayed back.</p><br/><p>He was also eager to move, but he couldn't just yet.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Qin Guan, he had sent one of his early films to Dubai and won the Best Creativity Award along with 350,000 dollars.</p><br/><p>Now he had finally left poverty behind him.</p><br/><p>Life on the road was always interesting. As Qin Guan put on all his clothes at the capital airport, he received his first call in China. The call was from Ning Hao, who wanted to talk about his new beginning as a director.</p><br/><p>\"Hello?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's me! Ning Hao!\"</p><br/><p>\"I know. What's the matter? Did you get the bonus? Do you want to take me out and treat me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Are you free?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! Let's meet today at the usual place.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hung up and turned to Sister Xue and Cong Nianwei. \"I'm going to the 798 Warehouse. Do you want to come with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Is it about work?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, Ning Hao has become rich and wants to express his appreciation.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, thanks.\" The two women shook their heads together.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan led his team to the firm minibus. Before departing, he told Cong Nianwei, \"You can leave the luggage in the car. The driver will take it to the firm. It's too heavy for you to lift it up to the third floor.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I'll wait for you at home. Come back as soon as you can.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue couldn't stand to be around them. She just wanted to see her bald boyfriend already. Qin Guan took a cab to the 798 Warehouse, a place that was filled with memories.</p><br/><p>So many years had passed since the last time he had been there. The dirty path had turned into an asphalt road as the fast-developing capital had come to accept the charming artists. The residents had even built some postmodern sculptures, and the designers had saved them while they had been building the new facilities.</p><br/><p>The art center, which had always been dedicated to fine art and film, had finally attracted public attention. The directors of the sixth generation had preserved the shabby warehouse with the same passion that they had stuck to their dreams.</p><br/><p>Although most people had left the shelter, Ning Hao, who still held fast to the place, welcomed Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>When the big wooden gate was pushed open, Qin Guan was overwhelmed by the heat inside.</p><br/><p>The stove and the chimney had remained the same, but Ning Hao had installed a radiator to improve the living conditions. He was only wearing a pair of blue pajamas in the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered along with the cold winter wind, unfastened the scarf and buttons on his coat, and poured something out for himself from a kettle on the stove.</p><br/><p>\"Wonderful! Is it tea soup from Niu Street?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put the glass down on the greasy table and fixed his eyes on Ning Hao.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter? Tell me. This is not just dinner, is it?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Hao grinned at him. \"There's this script that I've had in my hands for a long time. If it wasn't for the Dubai Festival, I would never have told you about it.\"</p><br/><p>\"You know, I'm the only loser in this group. I stayed here and asked help from my friends. At first, I wanted to send this script to producers, film companies and other state-run studios... Maybe someone would appreciate it.\"</p><br/><p>He stopped Qin Guan, who was about to speak.</p><br/><p>\"I know what you are thinking. You have been really kind to us. Even though you are an award-winning actor, you still acted in indie films for free or for very little money. I couldn't ask you to act in this film though.\"</p><br/><p>\"Things are different now! I'm a millionaire! I'm so rich that I can produce my own film!\"</p><br/><p>\"My goal is clear, Qin Guan. This is not an indie film, it's a commercial one. I want to make money! I want to make profit from my film!\"</p><br/><p>\"The media said that you are filming indie films. Look at it, Qin Guan! Just look at it! I think it will sell lots of tickets!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the excited man and took the script with a smile. He already knew its title.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

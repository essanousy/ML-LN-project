She was busy and deeply troubled.</p><br/><p>She exchanged information with the president of the fan club and asked them to organize some activities. Then she talked with Qin Guan's referrer, Qu Xuemei, about their promotion plan for the future.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, there was another team engaging in similar affairs.</p><br/><p>In a mansion in Singapore, Fang Meiya was busy working, when her private telephone rang. It was her secretary. \"President Fang, Mr. Shao Xiaobing has come for a visit. He is in the lounge on the first floor.\"</p><br/><p>Fang Meiya massaged her forehead. On the screen before her was the webpage of the Asian Fashion Man competition.</p><br/><p>She hesitated for a while before she said, \"Not today. Tell him I\u2019ll contact him when I have time. I\u2019ll help him with the vote, but the outcome will depend on his own ability.\"</p><br/><p>The secretary hung up in surprise. It was the first time that frequent visitor got the door shut against his face. Her president had spent several months on him. All the staff had thought their romance would have a happy ending. It had been nothing but another fling though.</p><br/><p>What did that last sentence mean though? With enough ability, Shao will not lose?</p><br/><p>She was a professional secretary, so she conveyed Fang\u2019s words tactfully. Shao smiled and left the hall of the Media Building in sunglasses with his agent, who was looking at him worriedly.</p><br/><p>Fang Meiya, who was weak when it came to romance, would find a new lover. His representative contract would last for another half a year though.</p><br/><p>If he succeeded in the competition, he could negotiate with Fang about more favorable terms. If he didn\u2019t, he would descend from heaven. Half a year later, he would have to return to China and his gloomy life.</p><br/><p>Shao would not be able to bear that. He had climbed up from that circle. He couldn\u2019t fall in the dust again. He had no choice but to win the competition.</p><br/><p>\"I have to win. You must help me,\" he told his agent.</p><br/><p>His agent had been with him ever since his debut. \"Don\u2019t worry. I have contacted some major companies. We won\u2019t lose the competition.\"</p><br/><p>Fang was a little distracted by Shao\u2019s visit, but she was immediately absorbed in a dialogue box that jumped up on her MSN page.</p><br/><p>The head image in the box was that of a savage man, whose skin had become copper-colored from sunshine. He was lean and handsome, full of male hormones. Beside the image were Fang\u2019s notes: Chang Jin, male, Singapore Fashion Man, 22 years old, Taiwan.</p><br/><p>He had been voted Singapore Fashion Man that year. Naturally, he had become Fang\u2019s prey. He was also skilled when it came to romance. They were currently playing a hunting game.</p><br/><p>Shao was an ambitious man, and Fang had helped him with the representative of Cartier. It had been a fair exchange. If he was capable, he would rise higher thanks to that foundation. If there was someone better than him, Fang wouldn\u2019t keep being charitable.</p><br/><p>That guy... Qin Guan...</p><br/><p>Fang was distracted again. That warm smile and that cup of tea were still lingering in her mind.</p><br/><p>She shook her head to clear it off that nonsense. Putting on her cynical mask again, she began to fantasize about Chang. What will he do to me in bed with his wild style?</p><br/><p>The competition was still going on. Data was sent unceasingly to Shao\u2019s agent.</p><br/><p>The next morning, when Qin Guan woke up, he and Sister Xue looked at each other speechlessly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was 10th among the 20 candidates, while Shao was far ahead.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue shouted at Qin Guan angrily, \"All the other candidates are working hard! Help me, okay?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused. What can I do to help you? You can do anything yourself. </p><br/><p>There was only one thing in the world that Sister Xue couldn't deal with though, and that was the will of the people. Compared to models from other countries, Qin Guan had the greatest advantage: China\u2019s large population.</p><br/><p>His country had the largest population in the world, and Chinese people would be interested in only him and Shao.</p><br/><p>A person with no idea how the fashion circle worked might vote for Shao for his sophisticated resume. Shao had been the first to break the limits of the domestic fashion circle. Now he would rise to national glory thanks to ordinary Chinese people.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's fans, representative brands, advertising companies and magazines grew worried. A model out of the Chinese fashion circle has no direct relationship with us. Our representative will promote our business though.</p><br/><p>A.M. could hardly retain its composure. As its exclusive model, Qin Guan\u2019s popularity was closely tied to them. He had become their successful image during the promotion of other brands.</p><br/><p>If Qin Guan lost to other models, A.M. would not look professional. All the staff in their Public Relations Department took action. Their best skill was promotion after all!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

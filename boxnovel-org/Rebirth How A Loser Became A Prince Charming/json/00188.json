She threw the controller at the couch angrily. Tomorrow I\u2019ll buy it! Who said sports body wash is only for men? Who?</p><br/><p>Finally, Qin Guan had become famous. His advertisements were everywhere. Of course, the audience didn\u2019t remember his name, but it was familiar with his striking face.</p><br/><p>J clothing and LEE jeans were doing good on sales, and so was ELLE clothing, which had published a photo of Qin Guan on its back cover. The brands who had invited Qin Guan to their shows could also show off to their distribution partners.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's status in the modelling circle was upgraded to somewhere between B+ and A-. The director of the Marketing Department at New Silk Road was in a really good mood. A rising star would promote the image of the whole company.</p><br/><p>The offers for advertisements, runway shows and printed media came one by one. His phone nearly exploded from ringing 24/7. The audience had made its decision.</p><br/><p>Other big 4A advertising companies rushed over. Very seldom could a face be remembered by the audience like that, let alone a face that belonged to a male model.</p><br/><p>Film companies, who always observed the events in the entertainment circle, also took action.</p><br/><p>A guy that 30% to 40% of the audience was familiar with was extraordinary even for them. Qin Guan was more famous than their second level stars. They could never let such a talent slip away.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue\u2019s phone kept ringing from early morning till late night.</p><br/><p>They wanted to have an interview, take photos, invite Qin Guan to fashion shows, or sign a contract with him. Sister Xue was very annoyed.</p><br/><p>That was only one side of reality though. Meanwhile, a terrible rumor was spreading on the internet.</p><br/><p>\"The most handsome actor in period dramas was originally a model.\" That was the gossip going around.</p><br/><p>\"I have a catalogue of Qin Guan's photos!\" Fans had made a film using Qin Guan's videos and photos.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is a senior here!\" This was a post from a traitor from college. In a short time, the posts about Qin Guan reached the top of the Haijiao Forum.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Qin Guan felt annoyed by his fame. The students at his college knew him well, so he was under observation all the time.</p><br/><p>Putting on sunglasses and a cap, Qin Guan met the real estate agent in secret. He sighed in relief. It was a wise decision to buy a car in advance. Otherwise, I would not be able to escape from college. They keep gossiping about everything. They follow me everywhere and share their experience online with other fans.</p><br/><p>The attitude of the agent had changed completely. I have served a star. Although he was only an advertisement star, it was enough for him to show off to his other clients.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m Qin Guan\u2019s exclusive agent. He bought more than ten houses from me. That sounds really powerful and professional!</p><br/><p>He put a pile of paperwork on the desk. He had gone through every street and hutong, distributed leaflets, and fought with the neighborhood committees, all for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>In 10 days, he had found eight small houses of different structures in different areas. He had also gotten the phone numbers of the owners. That day, he would show Qin Guan everything.</p><br/><p>They walked around an area with one-storey houses. The houses there had grey walls and seemed very old.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered a small house. At first glance, he saw bed sheets, clothing and diapers hanging on a clothesline in the yard.</p><br/><p>The agent led Qin Guan through all the blocks. Finally, they reached the house furthest to the right. Before he took out the key, an old woman stopped him. She was cleaning vegetables right next door.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, young man. Where are you from? Why are you going into Zhang\u2019s house?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m an agent, madam. The owner has hired me to sell the house. This is a buyer.\"</p><br/><p>The old woman was surprised. She put down the vegetables and stood up. \"Aha! You\u2019re that boy from the advertisements! The medicine, the biscuits... I\u2019ve watched them all!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled.</p><br/><p>The old woman cheered up. He is more handsome than he looks in the advertisements. I should help him so he doesn\u2019t lose any money.</p><br/><p>She followed them into the house in high spirits. She was afraid that Qin Guan might be cheated by the agent.</p><br/><p>It was a small house with only one bedroom and a living room. In fact, it was just one room divided by a wall. The kitchen was in the yard, and the washing room was outside. There was nothing much to see.</p><br/><p>The room was facing east and west, and it was around 30 square metres. It would be a good residence for a single man.</p><br/><p>The old woman thought Qin Guan would leave in disappointment. The agent looked nervous as well.</p><br/><p>\"How much is it?\" Qin Guan asked.</p><br/><p>\"4,000 yuan per square meter. More than 120,000 in total.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, deal! Show me the next one!\" The other two were shocked. You\u2019re buying a house after only one glance? You should bargain, or try to look for shortcomings!</p><br/><p>By the time the old woman came back to her senses, they had already left.</p><br/><p>\"That boy is so generous. Lao Zhang is really lucky! He got rid of that shabby house!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The foundation dates of Chinese colleges were recorded very carefully. The day of the anniversary, college alumni visited from all directions and the school authorities invited capable and important students to attend the ceremony as guests of honor.</p><br/><p>In America, school anniversaries were so low-key that Ivy League students didn't even know about them.</p><br/><p>Columbia attached great importance to the event, but due to the fact that each department was independent, the schedule was unfortunately delayed.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was surprised by the paperwork the principal gave him. When he read through the program, he was stupefied. The event would last a whole year, starting from April. Was that really a school anniversary?</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoxiao, who was standing right next to him, remained calm. Columbia was a college that focused on the practical application of knowledge, so the school anniversary was actually a way to re-integrate resources from its students. It would take a long time for the school authorities to bring together the college's students from all over the world.</p><br/><p>They would have to look back to the past before they looked ahead to the future. College activities would help them find a sense of belonging and opportunity, so that all their powers could be woven into an unbreakable rope.</p><br/><p>As the news spread, the different departments began to plan events fast. Some older students had already showed up at some departments. Of course, the university itself wouldn't just stand by idly. They started planning activities that would suit both refined and mainstream tastes.</p><br/><p>The academic circle, which was in charge of the most serious part of the celebration, invited many scholars, including Nobel winners, to give lectures in public halls. There was a lecture by a top scholar of a different scientific field every week.</p><br/><p>The school authorities gave more thought to the entertaining part of the festivities. They united the nearest communities and organized cultural activities like festivals, carnivals, jazz concerts, health fairs, movie projections and dances.</p><br/><p>All of these events were a joint effort of students from different departments. As one of those students, Qin Guan played an important role in the ceremony.</p><br/><p>His award ceremony was closely connected to those events after all. Qin Quan felt like an alien among the serious graduates. He was the mascot of Columbia, a glittering, gleaming fortune cat that attracted donations.</p><br/><p>As a result, the school authorities asked him to attend at least one more activity besides the award ceremony.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan just chose a random colorful envelope from the principal's hand. To him, they were all the same.</p><br/><p>\"The white one seems simpler.\"</p><br/><p>He had to be good at answering multiple-choice questions.</p><br/><p>Xu was filled with hope. As Qin Guan took the paper out of the envelope slowly, he urged him enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>\"Dance! Dance!\" He had been longing to watch some beautiful dancers.</p><br/><p>His wish was not granted though. Qin Guan spread the paper out and read the black letters. It was a stand post at a health fair. It was actually number six, which the Chinese considered a lucky number.</p><br/><p>I like trading.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan confirmed the date and time with the principal before leaving happily. Xu had to sit down on a bench. His limbs felt suddenly very weak.</p><br/><p>He could almost see the dancers' miniskirts and long legs fade away in the distance. He would have to spend his day with annoying children, angry fathers and fat housewives.</p><br/><p>American families liked fairs, because they could buy all kinds of cheap things and snacks there. It was their favorite kind of party. To Qin Guan, it sounded a lot like a modern version of Chinese countryside fairs.</p><br/><p>He actually liked that option. \"You should be happy. This is much better than a children's carnival after all...\" he tried to comfort his sad friend.</p><br/><p>The thought of those crazy kids made Xu feel much better.</p><br/><p>Time flew by as they prepared for the fair. April arrived quietly.</p><br/><p>It was a sunny day, and the whole street beside Columbia University was filled with flowers and balloons. Posters of Qin Guan could be seen everywhere. He would be the day's hero.</p><br/><p>A group of policemen had showed up at the site early in the morning. Henry was standing among them in a formal uniform, his numerous medals decorating his chest. They were sparkling in the sunshine.</p><br/><p>The official spokesman of Columbia University and host of the award ceremony was a New York senator. That explained why the college authorities had asked him to host the event.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

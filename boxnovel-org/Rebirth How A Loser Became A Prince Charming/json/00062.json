I have signed a contract with a model agency as a C-level model, just to state that I engage in the profession. My tutor said that I could advance to B-level and win a prize. Then my salary would be much higher. That\u2019s why I want to participate in a competition.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing and Li Jian nodded together in understanding. Their reaction changed at once. They hugged Qin Guan from both sides and said, \"It's still early July. It's about a month and a half from the middle of August. We can make a good plan for making money.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was quite annoyed. He started arguing with them, \"I will go on dates with Cong Nianwei. I have neither seen a movie, nor gone shopping with her in a while. I have to reject your proposal.\"</p><br/><p>They all rolled together into a ball. Li Jian sat on Qin Guan, panting. \"You can make time for both dating and making money. I believe in you. You are the best money-grubber in Y city.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't breathe under his 100 kilos. He patted the floor hard and shouted, \"Get up, Li Jian! You\u2019ll break me!\"</p><br/><p>\"No! I won't get up unless you come up with an idea for making money!\"</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to choke, Qin Guan\u2019s brain started working at a very high speed. Suddenly, inspiration hit him.</p><br/><p>\"I've got it! Move your ass away from me!\" Zhou Jing jumped over immediately and pulled Li Jian up. Qin Guan was lying on the floor in distress like a limp noodle.</p><br/><p>They both asked urgently, \"What kind of business is it? Tell us!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up from the floor and lay down on the couch before saying, \"We can set up a stand on the beach.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing and Li Jian were surprised. \"Shall we sell shish kebab again? The beach is full of kebab stands. Big restaurants are fighting over a spare place. How could we compete with them?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head, \"We won't sell kebab. That was quite a tiring job. We\u2019d be busy the whole day. My plan is to get a counter on the first swimming beach.\"</p><br/><p>\"Zhou Jing, you have to buy a glass counter from the canteen of the Bureau of Retired Veteran Cadres. Then you will go find your second aunt. She's selling wholesale clothes in Sanzhan Market, isn't she? Ask her about the price of swimsuits this year.\"</p><br/><p>\"Li Jian, you go to the Changsheng Freezing Drink Factory and buy some frozen lollipops and sodas for wholesale. That's our current arrangement. If we come up with anything else, we'll meet and discuss it. By the way, Zhou Jing, on your way to Sanzhan Market, you should have a look at the stands selling swimming rings. When everything is ready, we'll meet at my house.\"</p><br/><p>Li Jian and Zhou Jing broke up in a hubbub, busy with their own affairs.</p><br/><p>In 1999, the city of Y had not made the list of the country\u2019s best cities based on living conditions, and the tourism industry had not been explored on a large scale.</p><br/><p>The sky there was clean blue and the ocean was pure green. Two small swimming beaches were enough for the residents of the city to enjoy a leisurely vacation.</p><br/><p>On his shabby bike, Qin Guan jangled through two alleys across his house to reach the beach, which was still quiet.</p><br/><p>The summer sunshine was warm against the sand, and the sea breeze was blowing against his face, smelling slightly of fish. A group of seagulls with white feathers and black wings were gathered together. They did not look completely sober. Their eyes were only half open.</p><br/><p>A small crab was running transversely on the white-yellow sand. The leisurely, beautiful scene made Qin Guan suddenly want to play a game. He pedalled hard twice and rushed into the sand with his bike.</p><br/><p>The bike was instantly trapped deep into the sand. Qin Guan took the opportunity to throw it away and lie down on the sand facing the sky. The startled seagulls woke up and spread their wings to fly away.</p><br/><p>One or two of them, who were in charge of alarming the rest, turned around to check the situation.</p><br/><p>They saw a strange human lying on the soft sand in a \"\"posture. Qin Guan smiled with his eyes closed. He felt quite comfortable in the sunshine.</p><br/><p>He lay down on the beach until the sun was high in the sky and the sand was a little hot. Then he stood up again.</p><br/><p>He shook the sand off his body, took off his shoes and walked to the reception of the first swimming beach barefoot.</p><br/><p>The reception in 1999 was quite simple. There was only a small window selling tickets and a simple oblong bathing place. There were two bathing rooms for ladies and gentlemen on both sides of the window.</p><br/><p>The swimmers in the sea had to be experienced as their bodies were rough in the sea water, and there was sand in their hair and bodies. If they walked home or back to their hotels in their wet swimsuits, they would be quite uncomfortable though.</p><br/><p>The simple bathing rooms of the first swimming beach provided the swimmers with hot water for showering. It only cost three yuan to take a shower there. Although there were only sprayers with big iron tubes, they were quite practical for swimmers.</p><br/><p>As a result, the ticket window was the most crowded place on the beach. Qin Guan went there to talk to the old woman selling the tickets.</p><br/><p>It was not a weekend, so she was not that busy. Sister Liu liked chatting with handsome young men. She agreed to Qin Guan's request without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>The bathing room was her private business, which had belonged to her husband.</p><br/><p>Part of her income was submitted to the government, but the 100 yuan Qin Guan would pay her as rent would be a bonus. He wouldn\u2019t occupy room in her ticket booth. He would only set up an outdoor counter beside the bathing rooms. That was okay with her.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan ended their discussion and walked out of the ticket booth, he remembered that he had forgotten to tell Zhou Jing something. He called Zhou Jing, who sounded a little annoyed. \"You're just in time, Qin Guan! There are so many types of swimsuits. I\u2019m really confused. Come here and help me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless. \"Give me the number of the stand. I\u2019ll take a bus there.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's in the third row, number 1133. Hurry!\" Zhou Jing hung up.</p><br/><p>The Sanzhan Wholesale Market was located on the most flourishing street in the centre of Y city. It was south of the North Road Bus Station and the Port Passenger Station, and north of the Master Station for Remote Shuttle Buses . It was also only 15 kilometres from the airport.</p><br/><p>The market engaged mainly in wholesale and retail of computers, household appliances, shoes and makeup. It was the most famous distributing centre in Y city.</p><br/><p>The wholesalers were working hard to promote famous brands, such as Sama leisure costumes, Diri T-shirts, Sister Han minority costumes, Wencheng Princess shoes, and others.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

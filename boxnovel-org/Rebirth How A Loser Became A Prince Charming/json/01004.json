Some people posted the video on the entertainment section, so the curious fans clicked on it.</p><br/><p> What the f*ck! That's a bazaar! Are you kidding me? F*ck! That's Qin Guan!</p><br/><p> \"Director! Come check out the audience ratings!\"</p><br/><p> The director frowned at his assistant, who was in his office at the Beijing TV Station.</p><br/><p> \"Calm down! What happened?\"</p><br/><p> \"Director, the audience ratings have increased by 9%!\"</p><br/><p> \"What? Am I dreaming? We're on the same level with the most popular programs around the nation!\"</p><br/><p> \"The clicking rate has also reached 80 million! It's still rising as we speak!\" The director fell back against his chair. He felt like he was having a heart attack.</p><br/><p> Shall I send someone to Xiaotangshan to wait for Qin Guan?</p><br/><p> He was too late. As soon as the news had leaked, Qin Guan's phones had started ringing one after another. Sister Xue was grinding her teeth. You went and exposed yourself!</p><br/><p> On the other side of the ocean, Qu let out a long sigh of relief. The guy from Warner Bros. had been visiting her office for about one month and crying his eyes out just in an effort to confirm Qin Guan's schedule. This was Qin Guan's fault. He had accepted the script and then disappeared, leaving Qu to clean up the mess for him. </p><br/><p> The representative of Warner Bros was scared to see Qu welcome him with a smile that day.</p><br/><p> \"Congratulations, William. If you want to see Qin Guan, here is your chance. He showed up again in Beijing.\"</p><br/><p> Qu turned the screen of her computer towards him.</p><br/><p> \"I think his studio will issue an official explanation for that video.\"</p><br/><p> \"Really? Thank you so much, Ms. Qu. I must have misunderstood before. You are not the monster everyone thinks you are!\"</p><br/><p> Great! Now, f*ck off!</p><br/><p> William left her office screaming, scratching and scrambling. Then, he headed straight to China. Qu was right. The next day, Qin Guan's website was updated with a series of dazzling news.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan had taken his wedding photos at the Palace Museum! They were so beautiful! The traditional Chinese costumes of the couple looked brilliant!</p><br/><p> Was Cong Nianwei pregnant? Qin Guan was going to be a father. The couple would soon be welcoming a baby. Would it look like its father or its mother?</p><br/><p> The excited fans sent the couple their best wishes.</p><br/><p> \"Congratulations to the new parents!\"</p><br/><p> Sister Qu received hundreds of calls from mother and infant care brands.</p><br/><p> \"What's your offer for Qin Guan? Which brand are you representing?\"</p><br/><p> \"Er Lu!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan hung up when he heard that name. In 10 days, that brand would go bankrupt.</p><br/><p> \"We produce diapers! All we need is one photo and we will provide you with diapers for your baby's entire life.\"</p><br/><p> \"Its entire life? Are you an idiot?\"</p><br/><p> ...</p><br/><p> Sister Xue had no idea that someone was following Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> William had paid some cab drivers to watch the area around Xiaotangshan. It was a stupid, but effective idea. In a few days, he spotted Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were in their small garden when they welcomed Sister Xue, who came to visit them on weekends. Before they could greet each other, a cab roared and pulled up to the entrance of the garden. A man rushed out of the cab.</p><br/><p> \"Qin Guan! I finally found you!\"</p><br/><p> When Sister Xue came back to her senses, she let out a long sigh of pity for the poor guy.</p><br/><p> \"He is a representative of Warner Bros. He wants to have a discussion with you about that Batman film.\"</p><br/><p> Oh! I forgot about that film. I agreed to it back in America...</p><br/><p> Qin Guan opened the door for him awkwardly. \"Come in, please.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

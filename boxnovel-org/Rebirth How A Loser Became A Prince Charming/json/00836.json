He unfastened two buttons and stomped on the middle of the rope. Using that as leverage, he climbed up to the roof beam like a panda.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a group of security guards rushed into the empty temple. Qin Guan had already disappeared through the ventilation system and reached the roof.</p><br/><p>The internationally renowned robber had lost the third round.</p><br/><p>Ning Hao, who was really satisfied, congratulated the actors one after the other happily. Everyone was busy preparing for the next scene, so they were ignoring Wang Liying.</p><br/><p>\"Director Ning, Liu Hua, Guo Tao... Can someone get Qin Guan free?\"</p><br/><p>She was right. Qin Guan was still hanging from the beam.</p><br/><p>Everyone left like the tide, leaving Qin Guan and the anxious girl behind. Before Wang could cry for help, everyone returned, laughing and making faces at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! Were you afraid of being abandoned?\"</p><br/><p>\"Were you scared?\"</p><br/><p>I don't like the childish way you are making fun of me.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's good temper made him a good mediator, so he helped the whole crew work harmoniously. When Qin Guan was helped down from the beam, he began chasing and hitting everyone. Loud laughter echoed in the air.</p><br/><p>The film was coming to an end. Liu Hua finished his scenes first. Qin Guan rewarded him with a large bonus. This was a common gesture in the circle. The actor, whose character died in the film, would receive a large sum to drive the bad luck away, despite the fact that it was only a fictional death.</p><br/><p>This was the charm of traditional Chinese culture. One couldn't expect this in America.</p><br/><p>Liu Hua received a bonus as well, but he stayed with the crew. He wanted to see the other characters' deaths. He was confident that they would die as well.</p><br/><p>Ning Hao didn't disappoint him. The fate of the other guys was much worse.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was standing among the crowd downtown with a dirty face, torn clothes and several wounds on his body. He looked really poor under the sunshine.</p><br/><p>He called Wang Xun confidently.</p><br/><p>\"There has been a small accident, but things are still under control.\"</p><br/><p>He was confident about his professional skills, despite the fact that Wang had given up and left.</p><br/><p>After his request was declined, Qin Guan stood on the bustling street, feeling lonely and miserable.</p><br/><p>Everyone was trying to suppress their laughter as Huang Bo opened the lid of the sewer slowly from the inside. He had been struggling the entire night, so he was exhausted.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan watched Huang silently. The man, who was equipped with his own tools, got out of the sewer torpidly, leaving him at a loss. It was such a funny sight.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had lost the fourth round.</p><br/><p>As a professional thief, he was dedicated to his career. The customer was his god. Although Wang Xun had quit, Qin Guan would still carry on!</p><br/><p>As Xu Zheng put the jewellery in his own safe, Qin Guan made his final plan.</p><br/><p>He would hang down from the tall building and break in through the window of Xu's office.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

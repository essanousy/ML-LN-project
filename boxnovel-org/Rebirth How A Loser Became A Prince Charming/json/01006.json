Your grandchild is not an elephant. It couldn't possibly have that much milk powder!</p><br/><p> F*ck off!</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's protest didn't work. Everyone worked together to get him to leave.</p><br/><p> He suddenly heard someone laughing.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stared at the man from Warner Bros. \"You must be satisfied now. Let's go to America! Go!\" As soon as Qin Guan's flight took off, his website was updated with an exciting headline: Qin Guan had left his nest!</p><br/><p> The whole world joined in the jubilation. This was a good beginning. His fans wouldn't be worried about his career anymore.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan, on the other hand, was not in a good mood. He had watched the original cartoon and checked out the material collected by the crew, but the city where he would be staying was not as beautiful as he had imagined.</p><br/><p> Chicago was a city where light and darkness intertwined. When the production added metal monsters and piles of rubbish, Gotham City came to life.</p><br/><p> This was the second film of the Batman franchise, but it was groundbreaking in terms of quality. It was the first time superheroes would be portrayed with a complicated human nature and actual feelings. All the characters seemed to come to life.</p><br/><p> The film was a simple blockbuster with outstanding visual effects and a simple plot. The dark side of human nature showed through its every scene.</p><br/><p> Wherever there were human beings, there was chaos. The troublemaker was the cunning Joker, who had no superpowers, but could scare people with his personality. The character was a big challenge for every actor, which was why so many superstars had been interested in it. </p><br/><p> However, Qin Guan had been approved by the creator of the cartoon, as well as the director and the production company. When they saw Qin Guan in person on the set, everyone tried to keep a distance from him. There was a distinct deserted area around Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> People were not shocked by his appearance, but by his gloomy mood. Everyone was afraid of being affected by his sorrow.</p><br/><p> Actually, Qin Guan was sad because his wife had forsaken him.</p><br/><p> He was right. Cong Nianwei couldn't stand having someone follow her around all day long, so she had taken advantage of this chance to push him to join the crew.</p><br/><p> This experience was not bad for his interpretation of the character, though. Qin Guan seemed to be possessed by the Joker. The actors and the director were captivated by his acting skills. The creator of the cartoon even burst into tears.</p><br/><p> A person who had never been addicted to a cartoon would never feel the same as they watched a fictional character come to life. The man thought that he could finally die happy.</p><br/><p> Darkness was very closely associated with light. Only when Batman faced his nemesis did he realize that the Joker's ultimate goal was not to ruin a specific superhero, but to destroy the hope of all humanity. That way, even if god himself walked down the altar, his pious believers would still not have the courage to keep living.</p><br/><p> In the end, Batman had to hide behind the curtain. He was no longer the Knight of Light, but the Knight of Darkness. An arrest warrant was issued both for him and the Joker.</p><br/><p> When the director stopped the crew, Batman let out a long sigh of relief. He was happy to part ways with Qin Guan. It was ridiculous to see such a handsome guy dressed up as the Joker. Plus, Qin Guan's gloomy vibe made everybody's mood worse.</p><br/><p> Everyone fixed their eyes on Qin Guan. Now that the film was finished, they could all return to reality.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan remained the same, though. He just kept pacing in circles on the floor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They had done a good job during the shooting after all, and Qin Guan wouldn't negotiate with them any further due to his tight schedule.</p><br/><p>The rich businessmen from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia were also fans of his and clients of his firm. It was okay to have dinner with them. As soon as Qin Guan agreed, Director Chen left to prepare. Actually, he couldn't stand Qin Guan's new house. There was no food or drinks in it, which made it hard for a man to be hospitable.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan reached the Cantonese cafe, he experienced for the first time the grand dinners Hong Kongers enjoyed. Everyone was sitting around two large round tables. Chen, who was sitting in the middle, waved at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, over here! I saved you a seat!\"</p><br/><p>Then he pointed to another table. \"Your bodyguard can sit over there. This is a dinner with friends, not a business banquet.\"</p><br/><p>Han Zhujiu shot a glance at Qin Guan before heading to the other table. This was traditional Chinese dinner etiquette.</p><br/><p>Americans preferred crazy parties, but Hong Kongers liked to chat leisurely during teatime and make decisions for their businesses. Some people even spent the whole day at tea cafes.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan took a seat, he was shocked by the number of the dishes. Guangdong cuisine was actually famous for its huge variety.</p><br/><p>Chen showed off proudly to his friend. \"Hong Kongers have a sharp nose. I just got to America yesterday and traced the smell all the way here. The cafe owner's family has been living in Guangdong for generations. His son is still studying in Hong Kong.\"</p><br/><p>As he talked, the waiter pushed a dining car towards their table.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, make yourself at home. I got hungry while I was waiting for you. Let's eat and chat!\"</p><br/><p>All the patrons were attracted by the smell. There were all kinds of desserts on the dining car, each one served in a different container.</p><br/><p>Cute tiny buns with different fillings were served in bamboo steamer baskets, cold dishes were served in small white porcelain cups, and soup was served in deep bowls.</p><br/><p>The small portions met the demands of the customers, who could taste more dishes that way. There were too many things for them to see and try.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nearly forgot about the people sitting around the table. He was too focused on the dining car right next to him. The Asian waiter addressed the young man sitting next to the host.</p><br/><p>\"What kind of tea would you prefer? Tieguanyin, incense, narcissus, chrysanthemum, jasmine?\"</p><br/><p>\"Jasmine. I would also like...\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked by his answer.</p><br/><p>\"A steamed vermicelli roll, sticky rice in a lotus leaf, a steamed bun stuffed with roast barbecue pork, steamed shrimp dumplings...\"</p><br/><p>Soon, more than 10 dishes were set on the table. Although they were small in size, their meat and heavy taste made them very filling. The entire meal was twice the size of an average meal in Southern China.</p><br/><p>Before Chen could stop him, Qin Guan began to help the waiter move the dishes from the car to the table. When everyone had made their choice, they saw a pile of dishes mounted before the young man.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't feel embarrassed. \"Let's start. We'll have a better talk with a full stomach!\" he said before stuffing three dumplings into his mouth.</p><br/><p>How can he do that? His mouth is not even that big!</p><br/><p>The steamed vermicelli roll turned out to be Qin Guan's favorite. It was made according to a traditional cooking method, so it was as smooth as jelly. Everyone could see the filling clearly through the transparent crust.</p><br/><p>The cook took advantage of the location to use local ingredients for the filling. He got rid of the fishbones first and then smashed the meat into a sauce. The shrimps were large North American shrimps, and the fish sauce and shrimp were stuffed into the pastry along with pork and steamed on the fire.</p><br/><p>The delicious roll felt so smooth that the customers could taste the ocean inside it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

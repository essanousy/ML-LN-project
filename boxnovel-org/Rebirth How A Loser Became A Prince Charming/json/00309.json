He had experienced the power of news. He wondered if the girl would cause them trouble.</p><br/><p> Filming was not over yet though. Director Zhang wouldn\u2019t let the affair influence audience ratings.</p><br/><p>Time flew fast. Words couldn't express Huang Bo\u2019s pleasure, although he had only a few lines in the show. For him, appearing in a show was his only wish.</p><br/><p>Night fell. In order to save on electricity, the lights around the base were turned off. Hu Jun, who liked to spend his time outside at night, called a group of friends to go out for fun.</p><br/><p>There was some distance from the bar street in Dali. They drove several shabby cars downhill.</p><br/><p>When they reached the bar street, they returned to urban life again. To meet the demands of literary youth, the bars had adapted to different styles.</p><br/><p>Hu Jun, who was familiar with that kind of environment, selected a seemingly lively bar and led them in.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Huang Bo looked back. Huh? The actresses are following us.</p><br/><p>Liu Tao and Chen Hao, as well as Jiang Xin (the actress who portrayed Mu Wanqing), were all there. The famous Consort Hua was still a young girl at the time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled and entered the bar with Huang Bo.</p><br/><p>It was crowded inside. There were wooden bar counters, long benches and simple tables. It was the most popular bar on the street, so there were also singers playing guitars. In that dark place, under the influence of alcohol, everyone was enjoying themselves.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Huang Bo were chatting, when Chen Hao and Jiang Xin walked over.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, you\u2019re just drinking here all alone? Why didn\u2019t you come and greet us?\" Chen Hao picked some snacks from their table and started chewing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the two guys in curiosity. Is this Beauty and the Beast?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Huang Bo couldn\u2019t read Jiang\u2019s mind. The four young guys sat together and chatted. The girls were easy to get along with.</p><br/><p>They talked and drank. The bar owner was smiling so hard that the wrinkles on his face were all messed up.</p><br/><p>Hu Jun was drinking cocktails one after the other. The man looked like a bandit.</p><br/><p>As a frequent patron there, beer couldn't satisfy him. Liu Tao was staring at him as if she was obsessed.</p><br/><p>Chen Hao watched them before she turned to Qin Guan. \"Hey! Do you always charm girls with your face? Tell me, tell me, tell me! Don\u2019t think it over!\"</p><br/><p>\"Never!\" Qin Guan answered unconsciously.</p><br/><p>The girls burst into laughter. The boy was just like the silly monk he was portraying.</p><br/><p>The assistant noticed that Hu Jun was really drunk. He kindly asked everybody to head home.</p><br/><p>Hu Jun stood up unsteadily. Holding his cup, he said angrily, \"Why? I have no work tomorrow. You leave. My treat. I want some more.\"</p><br/><p>The assistant supported Hu and walked up to the cashier.</p><br/><p>Hu was already drunk. He couldn't stand still, even by supporting himself against the table. Liu Tao, who was keeping an eye on him, rushed over to help him.</p><br/><p>Hu was too tall and too strong for her though. She crashed into his arms instead.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and the others, who had already left, let out a breath of relief. They pretended to see nothing. Unfortunately, Chen Hao happened to notice the scene.</p><br/><p>She turned her eyes away calmly and pulled Jiang Xin out.</p><br/><p>\"What are they doing? Qin Guan and Huang, I\u2019ll drive in the same car with you.\" Jiang Xin suddenly pulled at her coat.</p><br/><p>\"I want to stay with you, Sister Hao,\" she said in a low voice. \"I\u2019m afraid...\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, I\u2019m here. Hey Huang, save two seats for us!\"</p><br/><p>Huang was speechless. They only knew his surname.</p><br/><p>They squeezed into the same car and returned to the base. Nobody talked about the matter.</p><br/><p>On the way back, Jiang\u2019s face was pale. She was not as brave as she would be in the future.</p><br/><p>They left to get some sleep. Nothing happened over the night.</p><br/><p>When Hu Jun woke up the next morning, his room was filled with sunlight. Covering his eyes, he asked, \"Who\u2019s there? Close the curtain for me!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Jingcao was sitting in a chair not far away from his bed with a serious expression on her face. Hu's poor assistant was holding the curtain in her hands.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

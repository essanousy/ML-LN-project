Just find some trifle news for me.\"</p><br/><p>Before the reporter could say anything, he hung up.</p><br/><p>Confused, the reporter stared at the photos on his computer for a long while. Then he put everything in the \"Rejected\" folder.</p><br/><p>That night was doomed to be a combination of noise and silence. By then, Qin Guan and Li Bingbing had returned to the hotel.</p><br/><p>On their way back, Qin Guan had stared at Li curiously. Li sighed. The boy is really lucky. He didn\u2019t plan or prepare for anything to get where he is now.</p><br/><p>By then, his salary was equal to that of a second-line star. Li organized her thoughts and explained everything to him.</p><br/><p>\"To put it simply, the Silver Eagle Festival gives no financial rewards to the winners. It\u2019s inferior to the Flying and the Five \u2018One\u2019 Projects awards, but it\u2019s still respected in the entertainment circle. Actors can upgrade their professional status with it. Directors, producers and investors will pay more attention to the winners.\"</p><br/><p>\"For example, XXX\u2019s salary used to be 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per episode. If she had won the favorite actress award today, she would have gotten more than 10,000 per episode starting tomorrow. It\u2019s a pity that this season\u2019s awards surprised everyone. The awards will have to be re-evaluated, so people don\u2019t lose their investments.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised his eyebrows. He had heard too much from Sister Xue about black box operations in fashion competitions.</p><br/><p>Ever since the New Face Competition, Professor Li had advised him not to participate in any other national contests.</p><br/><p>In fact, if Qin Guan won another national prize, he could be promoted directly to an A-level model without hard work. It seemed that evil people were the same all over the world. Qin Guan leaned back against the leather seat. This has nothing to do with my life.</p><br/><p>Li admired Qin Guan\u2019s calmness. He remained indifferent to both praise and humiliation. She was also attracted by his figure.</p><br/><p>He had no belly, even when he was leaning back. The buttons on his suit vest were shining with suppressed sensual passion.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! How do you maintain that perfect figure?\" she asked.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly opened his eyes. \"I was born this way, Sister.\" Males and females should keep a distance from each other.</p><br/><p>As a 20 year-old virgin, Qin Guan was sensitive to her soft hand.</p><br/><p>He sat up to avoid it, as it had been about to touch his chest.</p><br/><p>Then the two of them got out of the car. Li Bingbing's dress was blooming like a flower. She sized Qin Guan up and asked half-jokingly, \"Do you know my room number?\" Then she gestured, making him cough loudly.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia, who was just entering the hall, looked at her angrily. Her agent poured another basin of cold water on her. \"What are you looking at? Your nostrils are as wide as a cow's. Shall I put a nose ring on you?\"</p><br/><p>She had been cursed with a mean agent.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was taking off his clothes in his room, he nearly burst into tears. I lost a suit jacket during the Citizen launch event and a Burberry jacket today! They both cost me a lot! This is not my year.</p><br/><p>He was unfastening the last button on his shirt, when someone knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>He thought it would be Sister Xue, so he pulled the door open without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m ready, Sister Xue. Is there anything special about this buffet dinner?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he stopped. Liu Jia was standing outside shyly with his suit jacket in her arms. A thin woman, who seemed like her agent, was behind her.</p><br/><p>\"Qin, Qin Gan, I...\" Liu Jia was tongue-tied at the sight of his naked chest.</p><br/><p>The woman beside her covered her face. Even his childhood friends hadn\u2019t had such fierce characteristics. She seemed like a vicious villain who bullied the delicate, kind heroine. Only her acquaintances knew what a silly, brainless sweetheart she was.</p><br/><p>As a fierce fighter, she helped Liu reject countless unreliable pursuers so she wouldn\u2019t get swallowed up by the darkness of the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>Wanting to break up the deadlock. Li Tong said, \"Hello, Qin Guan. This is Liu Jia. Thank you for saving her on the red carpet. We would like to express our appreciation and return your jacket. It\u2019s very expensive after all.\"</p><br/><p>She pulled the jacket from Liu\u2019s arms and handed it to Qin Guan. \"Wow! No wonder Liu Jia kept talking about you. You look like an evil spirit!\"</p><br/><p>She pulled Liu Jia away. \"Thank you so much! Keep in touch!\"</p><br/><p>Then she closed the door with a bang and went downstairs with Liu.</p><br/><p>It was an insincere thank you. You didn\u2019t leave your contact information! How shall we keep in contact? It was just courtesy, right?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at the door. Interesting!</p><br/><p>His jacket had been returned though, which was a happy surprise.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

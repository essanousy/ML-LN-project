The total area was about 500 square metres, and the unit prices ranged between 3,500 yuan to 4,200 yuan. Qin Guan actually bought them all!</p><br/><p>The total amount was two million, which was enough to buy three houses in the city.</p><br/><p>The agent was over the moon. After that last round, Qin Guan signed the contract in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>The agent was mad with joy. If he added his commission that month and Qin Guan's bonus, he had made a big fortune!</p><br/><p>Besides, Qin Guan had entrusted the leases of all eight houses to him. Houses in that area were popular in the house-renting market.</p><br/><p>Hiding behind his desk, the agent opened the envelope with his bonus excitedly. Judging by its thickness, there had to be at least 1,000 yuan in it. Good, new 10-yuan bills. That\u2019s why it was so thick...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was finally relieved. He didn\u2019t need to do anything anymore. He just had to wait till Wanda started its business in 2004. Then his money would be multiplied by six.</p><br/><p>My capital was limited. Otherwise, I would have invested more.</p><br/><p>In the summer, the sun was shining fiercely in the capital and in Sister Xue's heart, who was now addressed respectfully as \u2018Sister\u2019 in the modelling circle.</p><br/><p>In the past few years, there had been many female models springing up, but male models were as rare as pandas. The combination of an informal agent and an independent model had shocked everyone in the circle.</p><br/><p>Reviewing Qin Guan\u2019s past, they discovered that as a green hand, he had participated in top shows and received positive evaluations. Thanks to his fame in the entertainment circle, Qin Guan had also become popular in the domestic modelling circle.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was meeting with delegates from film companies in her private meeting room at New Silk Road.</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! You\u2019re really stingy about sharing profits! I won\u2019t sign a contract with you!\"</p><br/><p>One of the delegates knocked on the contract in dissatisfaction. \"Two of a trade can never agree. It's common sense. But you invited us here, you cunning woman! You have the perfect model, so you make all the calls!\"</p><br/><p>\"We should just put all the terms on the table. That way, you can choose the best option. As long as you\u2019re satisfied, we have nothing to complain about. You are Qin Guan\u2019s exclusive agent after all.\"</p><br/><p>\"But she\u2019s saying no to everything! Are you kidding?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue forced a smile and picked up her pack of cigarettes. \"Would you mind?\"</p><br/><p>The men also took out their cigarettes with a nervous expression. \"Not at all.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone started smoking together.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue blew some smoke out before sighing. \"I know your terms are as favorable as possible for us, but do you know what my share was at the beginning?\"</p><br/><p>\"80 percent?\"</p><br/><p>\"70 percent?\"</p><br/><p>\"60 percent? Couldn't have been lower than that.\"</p><br/><p>\"30 percent! 30 percent for me and 70 for him!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. The cigarettes nearly burnt their fingers. Impossible! They immediately felt sympathetic towards Sister Xue. They now shared the bitter hatred of a common enemy.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue started telling them about her woes, \"He took only part-time jobs in his spare time. He refused to sign a long-term contract. He didn't accept plays outside the capital for fear of them affecting his courses. He denied longer plays or roles for the same reason...\"</p><br/><p>The delegates were feeling more and more sorry for Sister Sue. Misfortune always narrowed the gap between people. Sharing one's miserable experiences with others brought people close and strengthened the friendship between them.</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the meeting room. No company could meet Qin Guan's demands.</p><br/><p>He had been born an independent guy, but this was like waiting for food to start falling from the sky.</p><br/><p>As a rising green hand, one could not set such strict terms on their contract. They had to compromise in order to become a superstar.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue saw the opportunity and grabbed it.</p><br/><p>\"I know why you are all so eager to sign a contract with Qin Guan. I know him very well. He is an amazing model, but you must be wary of him. I promise that, as long as he is my model, he will cooperate with you whenever you need him, provided that the schedule is okay. The pay will also be reasonable. Don't worry, we won\u2019t play any dirty tricks when competing for roles, or seize main roles in plays with larger investments. Now, there\u2019s some good news. Qin Guan is a great student at college. He will go abroad in two years. Don't be afraid. Actors can see a clear sky after a cloudy soon. Be tolerant!\"</p><br/><p>The delegates burst into tears. The one from H. Brothers was the most inconsolable.</p><br/><p>According to his boss, he had to sign a contract with Qin Guan at any cost.</p><br/><p>What will I do now? I achieved my goal without doing anything. I should stop wasting time here. I should go back and report everything to my boss!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It's only nine o\u2019clock. It\u2019s too early for entrance.\"</p><br/><p>The girls grimaced. They could read just fine! They just wanted to see their idol earlier!</p><br/><p>Besides, many of them were not even qualified to go in. They had to wait outside in advance to get a look at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The kind-hearted man had to return to his post. His colleague, an older man, smiled at him. \"Don't waste your words on those young girls. Today we\u2019ll be really busy. Look at the crowd around the square! The organizer told us there would be 100 fans, but the whole square is full of people. It\u2019s always us who get exhausted after such events.\"</p><br/><p>The young man laughed and answered, \"I feel good. I\u2019m happy to see so many beautiful girls in the morning.\"</p><br/><p>The older security guard sneered. \"Enjoy it then!\"</p><br/><p>The younger man fixed his eyes on the beautiful scene on the square.</p><br/><p>There were increasingly more people. The shopping mall in the second ring was about to open.</p><br/><p>The Citizen staff put the last chair down and wiped the sweat off their foreheads. Everything is ready.</p><br/><p>Disappointed, the fans on the square realized Qin Guan hadn't gone through the front of the square as they\u2019d imagined, but had headed directly for the underground parking lot in an ordinary black business car.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan followed the security guards into the elevator.</p><br/><p>Looking at the four bodyguards in black suits around him, he whispered to Sister Xue, \"They look so nervous! Is there an army waiting for us or something? There will be only 100 fans on that big square.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was also confused. \"The Japanese always act like this. They are strict and serious about everything.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. In fact, he was contented with the guards, because it meant Citizen was paying close attention to him. Suddenly, the door opened with a loud sound.</p><br/><p>Everyone inside was scared. It was really crowded, and there were ropes all along the path for fear that people would block the way.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan whispered to Sister Xue with pursed lips, \"Shall I go in before the fans? What\u2019s going on?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue whispered back, \"No idea. There must be more than 100 people inside. The hall is nearly full.\"</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t talk anymore. Qin Guan went out of the elevator with the guards.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Look at me!\"</p><br/><p>\"I love you!\"</p><br/><p>Flashlights blinked everywhere. Fans waved their hands passionately, eager to attract the attention of their idol.</p><br/><p>The director of the flagship store was wiping cold sweat off restlessly. He shouted angrily at his assistant, \"How did the fans know when Qin Guan would arrive?\" His assistant was also puzzled. What had gone wrong indeed?</p><br/><p>On the square, the security director was rebuking the young security guard. \"You! Motherf*cker! Idiot! You would even forget your own name before a beautiful girl! You talked about the time on the intercom before them! You just wanted to show off to them!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wonderful! All the women outside know the details of the event now! Look at what you did! Where\u2019s the woman accosting you? Did she give you a red package?\"</p><br/><p>Mou Xiaoliu patted her chest in the crowd, sharing that thrilling experience with Huang Jiajia.</p><br/><p>\"Huang Jiajia, you\u2019re great! How did you come up with such a good idea? We should have kept the secret to ourselves though. Why did you share it with the other girls?\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia sighed at the simple girl and pointed to the crazy women.</p><br/><p>\"Do you think we could have broken through the security line just with our own strength? We have to rely on them to succeed. Plus, the law does not punish multiple offenders.\"</p><br/><p>Mou nodded, convinced. The two girls had caused a lot of trouble to Citizen and Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Before the ribbon was cut, the fans surged in. The foreign fans were still in the bus outside. What could they do?</p><br/><p>It was the worst possible outcome. The fans with invitations would rebel when they realized it was impossible for them to enter the hall. Both the director and Sister Xue were in despair.</p><br/><p>It was time for foreign fans to enter the site, but they were scared of their Chinese friends. Sister Xue showed her resourcefulness during that emergency. She talked with the director and got a microphone.</p><br/><p>After testing it, she addressed the fans crowded by the entrance of the Citizen store, \"Attention, please!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

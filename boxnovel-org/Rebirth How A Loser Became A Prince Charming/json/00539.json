He's the reason behind the affair!\"</p><br/><p>\"I just want to lock him in my basement. I don\u2019t want to share him with anyone else.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's fans expressed their heartfelt wishes while fence-sitters rushed to Qin Guan's side after seeing his photos and advertisements.</p><br/><p>\"I was just a passerby, but now I\u2019ve become his fan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Anyway, I like his face...\"</p><br/><p>\"The administrator is really cool. I can use the downloaded photos directly on my desktop.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. I\u2019m using his underwear poster as my desktop background!\"</p><br/><p>The vigor of the two opposing sides was diminishing.</p><br/><p>\"So what? He is nothing but a man relying on his pretty face.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Madonna is the queen of pop music! And Britney is so hot...\"</p><br/><p>They didn't take Qin Guan's talent into consideration. When the two parties reached a deadlock, another force joined the battle.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is the most charming man I have ever seen! You American guys are unbelievable!\"</p><br/><p>\"Obar Qin Guan is so handsome!\"</p><br/><p>\"On behalf of his fans in Singapore...\"</p><br/><p>A group of Asian fans emerged, some of them fighting back in their own language for the sake of convenience.</p><br/><p>Rongzhi, who was extremely talented at his job, said that accommodating to the compatibility of different languages was a piece of cake for him.</p><br/><p>This function was discovered by other stars on Meterfilter later. Their teams complained to the website administrators, offending the Meterfilter CTO.</p><br/><p>The strange foreign words shocked the American fans, who didn't know what they meant, but knew that they were written in a different language.</p><br/><p>No one had expected a Chinese actor and model to have so many fans from so many different countries.</p><br/><p>The attackers\u2019 voices started fading away, but it was the Chinese fans who made them fall completely silent. Using all kinds of ladders, Qin Guan\u2019s Chinese supporters climbed over the Great Wall and reached the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Chinese girls finally had a chance to get in touch with their idol.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! It's Qin Guan\u2019s new advertisement! It\u2019s so beautiful!\"</p><br/><p>\"No! It\u2019s beyond beautiful!\"</p><br/><p>In seconds, his fans reached 100,000, scaring the American visitors.</p><br/><p>On the forum, posts were refreshed so rapidly that people barely had any time to read them. The American visitors were trembling in a corner. What's happening? Can someone tell us?</p><br/><p>They couldn't read those ancient, mysterious characters, but the other side could read and fight back in English, which annoyed them to no end.</p><br/><p>In 10 minutes, the attackers left in defeat. From then on, Qin Guan's fans became known for their vigor.</p><br/><p>That strange phenomenon became a tradition on the forum. As a result, American fans were inclined to use Chinese characters to express their feelings, and so did everyone who disliked Qin Guan. They borrowed Chinese textbooks from Columbia so they could understand their enemies.</p><br/><p>None of them were aware that the textbooks were written in the complex form of Chinese characters, which made it much more difficult to learn Chinese.</p><br/><p>These events didn't influence Qin Guan's team though. As soon as the Chinese fans got to the battlefield, the outcome was determined.</p><br/><p>The battle ended and a new link appeared on the blog. The fans got excited about the news.</p><br/><p>In August, \"Heroes\" and \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" will air in North America, the advertisements of L\u2019Oreal and Cadillac will be broadcasted all over the world, and Qin Guan will appear on \"America\u2019s Next Top Model\" as a guest judge and attend the 2003 Berlin Film Festival.</p><br/><p>The fans, who were divided into two different groups, felt like partying. Qin Guan\u2019s American fans were celebrating, while his Chinese fans were sobbing.</p><br/><p>The Chinese fans shamelessly spoiled the film \"Heroes\" for everyone.</p><br/><p>During the exchange, fans from different countries became a harmonious family. Their love for Qin Guan broke the borders of languages as they cheered for him together.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about this. He was just lying on the couch, drinking beer and watching TV. Cong Nianwei watched the whole process and sent the link of the blog to all her friends and relatives.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

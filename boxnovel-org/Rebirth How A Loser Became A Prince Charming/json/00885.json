As a moral agent, she kept a proper distance from the actor she worked for. Even the subtlest action was prohibited.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got out of the bathroom and dried his hair off with a towel, smiling at her tactfulness. When he put on his pajamas and opened his laptop, he saw what she had meant.</p><br/><p>The microblog had caused him trouble again! The blog was an instant, convenient method to show off, yet it also had its flaws.</p><br/><p>In his previous post, Qin Guan had been standing barefoot on the white beach, the green ocean and blue sky serving as his background. That day, he hadn't updated the microblog in time for the banquet, which caused his fans to go crazy.</p><br/><p>His close friends and relatives used all kinds of means to make sure he was safe and confirm his schedule, but his fans online were not as lucky.</p><br/><p>Losing contact with Qin Guan made them question everything and come up with strange theories.</p><br/><p>\"Striking news! A military coup just took place in Thailand!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's terrible! But what has it got to do with us?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is in Thailand visiting a friend. Didn't you know?\"</p><br/><p>\"I had no idea. I thought he was at home!\"</p><br/><p>\"Check his blog. He was at Pattaya Beach yesterday!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh my! Is he in danger? This sounds terrible!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course it is. Remember the riots in France last time?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. People said that Qin Guan's team had met the thugs and the Chinese embassy had offered them shelter.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is he being held prisoner in Thailand? Will he return to China in time for the premier of 'Curse Of The Golden Flower'?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. I'm really worried about him. He always attracts accidents.\"</p><br/><p>\"He should just stay at home.\"</p><br/><p>\"He should go to Japan. There will be a film festival in Tokyo at the end of the year.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good idea!\"</p><br/><p>\"Good idea!\"</p><br/><p>\"Two of his films have already been short-listed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you think the island will sink if he visits?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Speechless, Qin Guan called his firm immediately to put a stop to that strange discussion.</p><br/><p>Soon, the microblog was updated with his latest news.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you all for your concern about Qin Guan. He is safe and sound. Goodnight, everyone!\"</p><br/><p>His loyal fans logged off happily. It was already midnight, so it was time to go to bed. The warm responses made Qin Guan feel less lonely in a foreign country. The worry caused by the banquet was gone, so he was able to get a good night's sleep.</p><br/><p>Despite those breathtaking moments, the trip was perfect overall. Qin Guan returned home with many specialties from Xie Hanren. He also got a large order from the Chia Tai Group, which would help his firm develop a lot.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei allowed Qin Guan to walk through the front door and then swept him from head to toe with pomelo leaves.</p><br/><p>\"Are you kidding me? These are used for returning prisoners!\"</p><br/><p>\"I have to sweep the bad luck away.\"</p><br/><p>Honey, you have been influenced by internet users. I know your username online!</p><br/><p>Absence always made the heart grow fonder. The two of them lay in bed shoulder to shoulder. It was really cold in Beijing during late autumn.</p><br/><p>After sharing their work-related news, Cong Nianwei cheered her boyfriend up with the latest news about \"The Promise\".</p><br/><p>\"Now Director Zhang can sit back and relax. He will win the battle easily. As long as the audience understands the film, it will enjoy a successful box office.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why?\"</p><br/><p>\"Get the laptop for me.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan jumped out of bed, rushed to the living room and returned as fast as he could. He might even have been faster than Liu Xiang. Without the obstacle of shorts, a man could reach his full potential.</p><br/><p>\"What do you want to show me?\" His hands trembled as he handed over the laptop.</p><br/><p>\"The comments on 'The Promise'.\"</p><br/><p>There was not a single good comment about the film.</p><br/><p>A film couldn't please everyone, but if it drove 99% of the audience out of the cinema, it had to be atrocious.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

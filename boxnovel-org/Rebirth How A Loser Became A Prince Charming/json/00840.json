Meanwhile, Chen Kaige left the building with a smile and got into his car. Then he sighed before his wife, Chen Hong.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan said no.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alas! Young people are so proud nowadays. He just turned down your script face to face?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. Young people have been succeeding a lot lately. He's won international awards, invested in domestic films, engaged actively in the industry... Rich men prevail nowadays.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Hong was no longer a young lady, but her past charm was still lingering on her face. The woman tried to comfort her husband.</p><br/><p>\"Actually, Qin Guan is not that amazing. He is only a handsome guy with a lot of young fans. We could just offer the part to another actor like him.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's hard to find such a guy in China. Huang Xiaoming is too young. Chen Kun is not good at commercial films...\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't limit yourself, Chen. We can look for an actor abroad. The South Korean fad is all the rage in Southeast Asia and China. We could cast the most handsome, popular guy among them. We could cast Zhang Dongjian!\"</p><br/><p>\"But we'd have to work extra hard to get a foreign actor. Plus, Koreans ask for a lot of money. We would go over budget.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Hong smiled at her husband. The man was good at directing, but ignorant when it came to commercial films.</p><br/><p>\"You think too much. We wanted to hire Qin Guan because of his money and acting skills. His salary would have been considered an investment. If Qin Guan worked only as an actor, instead of a producer, how much would you pay him? His value in Hollywood is 1.2 billion!\"</p><br/><p>\"This way, we will be saving money. We must show the Tiancheng Entertainment Company our sincerity. We are supporting them by giving up our original plan and trying some foreign actors. We are being kind to the newly-founded, rising company.\"</p><br/><p>Chen nodded. He was not good at handling complicated issues.</p><br/><p>Chen Hong smiled again and asked the driver to start the car.</p><br/><p>Wang Liying was reading the four scripts carefully in Qin Guan's car. She was very confused by Qin Guan's choice.</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan had seen all four films during his past life, so he had just picked the two most successful ones.</p><br/><p>One of them had been selected by the Venice Film Festival, while the other one had made a box office record by grossing 100 million yuan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan mentally apologized to Feng and Chen, but he had to think about his own benefit.</p><br/><p>Actually, he had to apologize to a lot of people, including the crew of \"The Knot\" and Cong Nianwei. He had been busy preparing for the Hong Kong Awards, so he hadn't seen her in a long time.</p><br/><p>Although the Hong Kong film industry was declining, the award ceremony was still in its early stages. Thanks to the lingering power of gangster films and comedies, the event was still popular among viewers in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.</p><br/><p>Nicolas Tse was among the people who picked Qin Guan up at the airport. The two young men had become good friends, so the paparazzi had the chance to take a picture of the two of them together.</p><br/><p>The reporters, who had been limited to that small area, finally discovered something interesting.</p><br/><p>Wow! Qin Guan and Tse seem very close to each other. As far as we know, Tse is not the only actor who has cooperated with him. Nobody else has showed up though. Does this mean that Qin Guan does not get along with the older generation? Is Qin Guan a rebel?</p><br/><p>All kinds of rumors were published in the newspapers along with the photos. Qin Guan had unintentionally contributed a lot to the Hong Kong entertainment industry.</p><br/><p>The next day, he walked to a newsstand next to his hotel on the Tsim Sha Tsu Beach wearing sunglasses, a shirt and a pair of shorts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

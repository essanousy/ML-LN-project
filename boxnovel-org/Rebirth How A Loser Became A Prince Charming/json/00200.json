What are you talking about? This is Japanese! Not Chinese!</p><br/><p>Japan used to have the most advanced fashion industry among all Asian countries. Their fashion magazines held a great share in Asia.</p><br/><p>The strict chief editor was pursuing perfectness in all aspects. Qin Guan had the impulse to give her a thumbs-up.</p><br/><p>VOGUE had hired a male model for its first issue in China. It was a bold idea that ELLE dared not copy.</p><br/><p>To meet the demands of their readers, most of whom were women, the covers of fashion magazines were mainly occupied by female models or actresses. Through their elegant style, professional, matching clothes and aesthetic shooting methods, their readers could experience the effect of top fashion magazines.</p><br/><p>That was why clothing, bag and watch advertisements in magazines could promote sales. They were trend leaders, who could guide readers into pursuing a more fashionable style.</p><br/><p>Therefore, a cover with a male model did not match ELLE\u2019s conservatism.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew that he would have to take only one picture for the cover. After a series of fussy steps though, he was shocked.</p><br/><p>The lenses were good, but the frames were bad. The chief editor of VOGUE had to be the most insane person in the industry.</p><br/><p>This was not a man-oriented magazine, and the sales volume of the first issue would be enough to decide the fate of the chief editor and the whole continent.</p><br/><p>The photographer was an American who had been sent in advance to make arrangements with the chief editor, and the prop master was French and filled with romantic ideas.</p><br/><p>The cover would be a black-and-white picture, far different from the colorful covers of other magazines. Thus, the chief editor had set high standards for the photo, which had made the photographer and prop master quite nervous.</p><br/><p>Tens of magazines would appear in newsstands and bookstores during the same period.</p><br/><p>The magazines would be arranged in one line on the same shelf. The order was decided by the retailers according to their experience.</p><br/><p>The nearer to the readers though, the better it was.</p><br/><p>How could one publish the most striking magazine and attract readers at first glance? Extreme beauty was required!</p><br/><p>France was called the fashion capital of the world for a reason. Their keenness and pursuit of beauty was too far ahead from other nations.</p><br/><p>Qu's brave effort was not just about shooting a black-and-white cover, but also taking a close shot of Qin Guan's face.</p><br/><p>It was a testament to photography as well as the model itself.</p><br/><p>The prop master was prepared. He gave Qin Guan an elegant mask weaved with ancient mooring ropes. Lotuses were blooming on it, and there was a sense of harmonious conflict to it.</p><br/><p>The mask covered Qin Guan's cheekbones, but exposed his beautiful eyes. His eyelids flapped down naturally, his long eyelashes covering his clear black pupils. His eyes looked really mysterious.</p><br/><p>He lifted his jaw to expose his Adam's apple. His thin lips would tempt anyone to commit a crime.</p><br/><p>It was a photo of high taste, quite different from the superstars of famous brands. The audience would admire Qin Guan\u2019s god-like beauty.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan held the mask up for more than ten minutes, keeping his body still. After countless small adjustments, the final version came out.</p><br/><p>It had a literary, reminiscent style to it.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went to the dressing room with a stiff neck. The excited assistant put the photos on Qu's desk as soon as they were ready.</p><br/><p>The receptionist was sitting outside the chief editor's suite.</p><br/><p>Qu had assigned her to be her second secretary, so she was in charge of everything concerning Asian models.</p><br/><p>It was like a god-sent gift!!</p><br/><p>She was really glad, not just because of the salary and position, but also because this was the job of her dreams. From then on, she could file all the paperwork of famous models and hand in the final data. Her dream had come true.</p><br/><p>The chief editor looked at the pictures and finally pointed at one of them. \"Tell the publishing group that this will be the cover of our first issue.\"</p><br/><p>Her assistant nodded silently and sent out the picture. The brave decision had come to a temporary close. They could only wait for the day of the release now.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went out of the fitting room and was hugged by the crew. They had been working in the industry for many years, yet they\u2019d unexpectedly found a shining gem in a mysterious country.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

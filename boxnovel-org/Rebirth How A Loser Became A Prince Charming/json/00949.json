It had to be a big compliment.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the only fashion insider Tim could not embarrass. They entered the studio together with polite smiles.</p><br/><p>\"You've dressed well today, Qin Guan. At least, this is better than being naked.\"</p><br/><p>Tim's compliments were always strange. Qin Guan tried his best to keep smiling.</p><br/><p>Tim chuckled to himself and turned towards the camera. This was a strategy he was using so he wouldn't look inferior compared to Qin Guan when they were in the same frame.</p><br/><p>The host told the contestants in a loud, excited voice, \"Here are the mysterious guests and guides of the second round. Qin Guan and Tim!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" the contestants screamed excitedly. Some of them bounced up almost as high as the ceiling. Their reactions went unnoticed though, as all the cameras were fixed on Qin Guan and Tim.</p><br/><p>Nobody would have been able to remain calm in their presence.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the dream model of every designer!</p><br/><p>\"How are you, everyone? I'm Qin Guan and I'll be participating in the show's fourth season.\"</p><br/><p>\"I won't introduce myself. I think everyone here already knows me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, Tim. I heard that the second round would be about me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. The nine designers will design clothes for you. I heard that you used to be the ambassador of some Chinese brand. Was it called W? Or was it C?\"</p><br/><p>\"It was J Clothing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. Well, I think our designers will be much better than that.\"</p><br/><p>You have a point. We might not be as good as Armani, but J Clothing must be on our level.</p><br/><p>The contestants were eager to try.</p><br/><p>\"Don't get overexcited,\" Tim warned them kindly. \"Don't forget the rules! You have 200 dollars and 30 minutes!\"</p><br/><p>We know the rules. We are not excited about that.</p><br/><p>\"Tim, may I take Qin Guan's measurements now?\" a bald man called G asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>Their goal was to observe Qin Guan closely or even touch him, if possible. Then they would be able to show off to their peers about it.</p><br/><p>\"Stop dreaming!\" Tim woke them up. \"Qin Guan has standard measurements. The staff has written them down here. Stop playing games, guys. You have only 28 minutes left.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan maintained his perfect smile before the camera. He had the elegance of a vase.</p><br/><p>The designers rushed back to their desks.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the perfect eye candy! In his late 20s, he was no longer a greenhand. He had matured through time and experience.</p><br/><p>Mental aura was a mysterious thing. Not everyone had it, but if one did, it was the most useful weapon for stealing the spotlight.</p><br/><p>Although Qin Guan was standing next to Heidi Klum and Tim, everyone's eyes were fixed on him.</p><br/><p>That's why I didn't want to be in the same frame with him. Nobody likes him.</p><br/><p>Actually, nobody likes you, Tim.</p><br/><p>All the contestants had to finish their designs in half an hour. Then they would have some time to select and purchase fabrics. The rest of their time would be spent tailoring.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the last contestant finished his design and ran to the fabric market next to the school. Everyone was completely focused on their work.</p><br/><p>They had to create formal outfits!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

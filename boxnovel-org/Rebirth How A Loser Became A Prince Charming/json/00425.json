There was no pursuit of life. Trembling, he stretched his bloody hand out to Marsha and looked at her with a miserable expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Both the director and the actress were lost in his sorrowful eyes.</p><br/><p>Marsha was out of control. Ignoring their terrible surroundings, she rushed up to Qin Guan and took his shaking hand.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll help you! Stay awake, I\u2019ll make a call...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan seemed comforted. His slender fingers held her hand tightly with more energy. At the director's request, the camera zoomed in on their locked hands.</p><br/><p>The director was suddenly enlightened. He tried to express his feelings through different methods. Practice made perfect after all.</p><br/><p>Young man, you were lucky to have an indie film actor in your dracula movie.</p><br/><p>The director was busy changing the position of the camera while Qin Guan controlled the whole process. His slack pupils were gradually concentrating as he got warm. He could see the operating lamp before his eyes, his internal organs hanging on the ceiling, and the beeping machines beside him.</p><br/><p>He didn't move. Instead, he closed his eyes quietly. Long eyelashes covered his eyes like butterflies with broken wings.</p><br/><p>\"Please... I want to leave... Forever...\" he said through pale thin lips.</p><br/><p>He preferred death over life, but he could not explain it in words. The bloody, violent scene turned to art thanks to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The director patted his thighs heavily. Who said that American Dracula movies are all about horror? Humanity is everywhere!</p><br/><p>Marsha was encouraged by Qin Guan. In her opinion, that kind of life would be an insult for the handsome man. She gently pulled her hands back, for fear of disturbing him, and slowly turned off the machines.</p><br/><p>Beep...</p><br/><p>The electrocardiogram turned into a flat line, indicating that the tortured man had gone to Heaven. Qin Guan didn't stop acting though. The script was too brief. The writer hadn\u2019t taken the natural reaction of a human body into consideration.</p><br/><p>The oxygen tank couldn't support him anymore. Qin Guan trembled as if he was experiencing an electric shock. After jerking a couple of times, his eyes opened again. His pupils went slack until any hint of feeling disappeared. His wounds had exhausted him. He had no energy to make a final effort. His toes were stiff. He had finally left that ugly world.</p><br/><p>What would Marsha face later on?</p><br/><p>The camera was still rolling as she fixed her eyes on the corpse on the operating table. She looked slightly obsessed. The director was also lost in thought, so he forgot to stop the camera.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt terrible on the table. He was nearly blind under the bright lamp. Plus, the table was cold and the lamp was quite hot. His nose was about to start running.</p><br/><p>He was groaning silently, when Sister Xue walked up to the director to remind him. It was crucial to have a considerate agent.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, okay... Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Wow! I saw tears in your eyes. Is this your first movie? Sister Xue had a point. The green hand had been shocked by the quiet death.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan jumped up from the iron table, Sister Xue buried her face in her hands.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, cover yourself with the sheet!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why? I\u2019m not naked.\" Qin Guan looked down and saw that his shorts were pasted on his body. They were soaked in blood. He looked like a wet temptation.</p><br/><p>He wrapped himself with the sheet fast. Then he smiled at Marsha awkwardly and ran to the dressing room. How embarrassing! I hope she saw nothing!</p><br/><p>Marsha hadn\u2019t seen anything. She had been staring at his bottom. That subtle invitation was the best kind of temptation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a shower in the dressing room. The sugar paint dissolved easily in the water. He got out and Fred applied some special chemical agent to the flaying surface to take off the latex pieces.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan went out with clean wet hair, Sister Xue had already gotten his payment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

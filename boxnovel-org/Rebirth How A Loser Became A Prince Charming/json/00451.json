Everyone in the hall went crazy. Such beautiful jewellery at such good prices!</p><br/><p>Because of the economic crisis though, buyers from occidental countries were much more prudent than they used to be. They hesitantly realized that the situation was out of control.</p><br/><p>In the first row, countless paddles were going up and down around the woman who had just bought the raw gemstone.</p><br/><p>\"Where are they from? They look so bold!\"</p><br/><p>\"They are from China. It\u2019s the first time Baselworld invited buyers from the mainland...\"</p><br/><p>\"That explains it. We are tied up in the Iraq war while they silently develop.\"</p><br/><p>The hammer of the host fell down. Each of the Chinese ladies had gotten a bracelet. Only half of the Cartier bracelets were sold out and Chinese buyers had taken 80% of them.</p><br/><p>The director of Cartier was depressed. The amount they had put on sale was actually the annual sales volume they had counted on. They had only sold 10 at the auction, which could be considered a failure.</p><br/><p>Is the global economy really that bad?</p><br/><p>The whispers around them didn\u2019t influence the Chinese women, who were in a really good mood. After the introduction of the host, Qin Guan got on the stage again. The ladies started screaming.</p><br/><p>\"Am I dreaming? Is that an Asian model?\"</p><br/><p>\"When did Tiffany hire an Asian model for its final exhibition? We missed the press conference while we were at the watch exhibition!\"</p><br/><p>\"What a pity! I love Asian models!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t jump to conclusions.\" A short-haired woman cast a contemptuous look at the stage. \"Maybe he is from Japan or South Korea.\"</p><br/><p> The girl with the moon-shaped face was not angry. She just watched Qin Guan carefully.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Sister Zhang! I think he looks familiar... Wow! I know him! It\u2019s Qin Guan! He\u2019s Chinese!\" She attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\"Chinese?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure enough!\"</p><br/><p>After confirming his nationality, they all became excited. They wanted to support the compatriot they had come across in another country. Whatever Qin Guan exhibits, we will just buy.</p><br/><p>\"This is Tiffany\u2019s latest 2003 collection, which is unprecedented for men's jewellery... There are only 100 sets all over the world. After the purchase, Tiffany can carve the name of the buyer on them...\"</p><br/><p>That was so considerate.</p><br/><p>\"The price is 300,000 dollars... Anyone?\"</p><br/><p>Before his voice could fade away, the girl with the moon-shaped face raised her paddle high.</p><br/><p>\"10 sets! Special service included!\"</p><br/><p>Before the other buyers could see the details of the set clearly, the Chinese buyer had made a risky decision.</p><br/><p>The host was stunned. \"Congratulations! No. 58 got the limited edition of the Tiffany men\u2019s set!\"</p><br/><p>It had taken Qin Guan only two minutes. One and a half for the introduction and 30 seconds to sell it. He returned to the backstage area and saw Michael rubbing his hands excitedly. He cheered up at the sight of Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Wait a moment, Qin Guan. Hold this. You have to get on the stage again.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a tray with a set of gorgeous diamond ornaments on it. It was for ladies.</p><br/><p>He shot a look at his female peer. The girl was staring at him furiously, as if Qin Guan had killed her whole family.</p><br/><p>It was a spontaneous idea Michael had gotten from the Chinese ladies. He could do nothing but apologize to the female model, who had lost a chance to appear before the rich buyers.</p><br/><p>If 30 seconds were too short a time for Qin Guan, the male model could also exhibit jewellery for women! He mounted the stage again with the tray.</p><br/><p>\"This is the Tiffany collection for ladies. 108 gems, including sapphires, emeralds, rubies and diamonds, connected in a hollowed-out mosaic. The sets differ based on their varying quantities of gems.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan lifted the tray up slowly. The host was talking eloquently next to him.</p><br/><p>\"Splendid colors\u2026 Exquisite design\u2026 Exclusive luxury... You will never come across another set like this... 1.88 million each...\"</p><br/><p>The introduction reminded Qin Guan of the cable channels in China, which were always broadcasting news in an exaggerated way. He smiled in spite of himself. It felt like a breeze blowing over. Both the Chinese women and the reserved European ladies got lost in his smile.</p><br/><p>In a few seconds, the small paddles were held up like bamboo shoots after the rain. The sets on sale weren\u2019t enough to meet the customer demand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

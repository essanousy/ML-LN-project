They were hoping to have a private meeting with her about Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The two brothers met with the top agent, who had been working with them on concept and crew selection for a long time. Wang was no longer the woman rushing about for actors with passion.</p><br/><p>\"You want me to ask Qin Guan to do the film?\"</p><br/><p>The brothers nodded. The strong, determined woman shook her head without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\"Impossible!\" Before they could ask any questions, Wang explained, \"Among all the films we will be producing in 2003 and 2004, there are only a few that could attract his attention. Those are \u2018Mobile Phone\u2019, \u2018Kung Fu Hustle\u2019, \u2018Ke Ke Xi Li\u2019 and \u2018A World Without Thieves\u2019...\"</p><br/><p>\"The first one does not fit Qin Guan's schedule, and Stephen Chow will take everything into his own hands, including the casting, shooting and post-production process. Huayi has no rights on the film. So, this one won\u2019t do...\"</p><br/><p>\"The remaining ones are \u2018Ke Ke Xi Li\u2019 and \"A World without Thieves\u2019. According to my sources, you have already contacted his agent with discouraging results. Then you remembered me, someone who helped him in earlier times.\"</p><br/><p>The brothers nodded awkwardly as Wang grimaced helplessly. When did we lose our way? Was it at the first intransigence? Or over our differences over films and budget? I can't remember...</p><br/><p>She sighed before she went on, \"There is still hope. As far as I know, Director Lu Chuan has a good relationship with Qin Guan. Considering his love for independent films, I think we don't need to consider \u2018Ke Ke Xi Li\u2019...\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides\u2026\" she said with a bitter smile. \"Your aim is \"A World Without Thieves\u2019, right? You are afraid that an award-winning actor would turn down a supporting role, aren\u2019t you?\" Looking at the awkward expressions in their eyes, Wang sighed again. \"You do not know him at all...\"</p><br/><p>\"The guy is not as ambitious as you imagine. He doesn\u2019t care about his image or status. He would never turn down an outstanding role or an attractive script. Sometimes, I believe that even money is not his real goal...\"</p><br/><p>The brothers felt relieved at her words. Suddenly, they felt respect for the great man. He seemed like an elegant man with exceptional taste.</p><br/><p>They were confident about their films that year. Director Feng Xiaogang was one of the reasons why.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that a group of people were currently analysing him. He had just arrived in New York to face the troublemaker that was Paris Hilton.</p><br/><p>She was so obsessed over her agreement with Cong Nianwei that she couldn't sleep in Los Angeles. As soon as she\u2019d finished her business there, she had contacted Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>If my friends knew what I was doing for him, they would laugh at me...</p><br/><p>She was sitting in the gallery of the Hilton Art Fair, blushing to the tips of her ears. Lan Jin was sizing her up from head to toe. He was watching the gallery for Cong Nianwei that day.</p><br/><p>\"Are you here for Qin Guan or Cong Nianwei? Don't lie to me. I saw the news! Cong Nianwei would never invite you here! The woman is very hard to deal with! Remember that!\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is very hard to deal with?\"</p><br/><p>The door opened at his words, the clay wind chime jangling behind it. Cong Nianwei and Qin Guan were standing outside hand in hand against the sunshine. They were staring at Lan Jin with a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>The guy silently hid Hilton behind his back when he saw the visitors.</p><br/><p>\"Cong Nianwei, you have a visitor. Do you know her?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, I invited her here.\"</p><br/><p>Before her voice could fade away, Hilton pushed Lan Jin away, her eyes focusing on the people outside.</p><br/><p>My love, I thought my longing would fade with the distance, but I was wrong. The feeling is still fresh when I see you. My love is surging like a stream... Qin Guan, my prince!</p><br/><p>Hilton was lost in thought again. Lan Jin was at a loss. He felt pity for her. She must have some kind of mental disorder. He pointed to his own head as he looked at Cong Nianwei. Is she okay?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

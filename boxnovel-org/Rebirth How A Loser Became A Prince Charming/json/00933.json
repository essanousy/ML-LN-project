She locked her arm around Qin Guan's.</p><br/><p>The two of them walked out of the bustling site elegantly. Then they exchanged a meaningful glance.</p><br/><p>\"You are one of the most graceful women I have ever met, madame.\"</p><br/><p>\"I think I'm just one of many women who have been fascinated by you, sir.\"</p><br/><p>\"So my flirting worked?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. But I have to be serious during filming.\"</p><br/><p>She was an outstanding woman. Time had graced her with both wrinkles and charm. A little eye contact was enough for them to become friends, despite the generational gap between them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan patted his chest after he parted ways with Debby. His confidence had been restored.</p><br/><p>The easy-going protagonist had pleased the crew, who now turned its attention to another important supporting actor. He was the actor who would be portraying a figure in the museum.</p><br/><p>Yes, it was Robin McLaurin Williams, the actor who would be playing President Roosevelt. Williams had won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for \"Good Will Hunting\" in 1997. As a comedian, he was good at depicting supporting characters.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan met Robin Williams for the first time, he was in his President Roosevelt costume. He was wearing a brown military uniform and a pair of long boots and holding a sword in his hands.</p><br/><p>This was a comedy though, so there was also a golden beard glued to his face. It was a perfect parody of Roosevelt's magnificent beard.</p><br/><p>Robin Williams looked like a really funny president.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried his best to suppress his laughter, as Robin had to act like a still figure on a base.</p><br/><p>He had to climb up the two-meter base and the horse on it, which was really hard for the crew. Robin was overweight, so he needed help in order to climb up.</p><br/><p>Several strong young men worked together to support his belly and arms using a ladder and a frame. Maybe a small crane would have worked better.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Robin got into position. He shot a look at the camera carefully. As soon as the director gestured at him, he pointed his sword in the air like a general.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to find another corner, as he was choking from laughter by now. This would be a good chance for him to work with an experienced actor.</p><br/><p>Soon, Wang Liying got out of the lounge with Qin Guan's schedule.</p><br/><p>\"Go to the fitting room. You have an independent scene 10 minutes after Robin is done. You need to seize the day, or we'll spend the night at the museum for real.\"</p><br/><p>\"Take it easy. I have never failed while shooting a film.\"</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Qin Guan waved goodbye at Robin, who was still sitting on the horse. The other actor winked in response.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's costume was simple. It was only a black-and-gray security guard uniform. Of course, uniforms differed in different countries.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

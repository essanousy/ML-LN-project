He had more than 30 delivery boys working for him.</p><br/><p>As a successful businessman, he believed in a professional vision. It was said that there would be a new magazine released that day, but he hadn\u2019t paid attention to it. The distributing bureau assigned a basic magazine volume to him, so he had to trust them.</p><br/><p>He had the ability to swallow magazines up after all.</p><br/><p>Pipe stamped on his brakes and parked his car between his delivery boys.</p><br/><p>When he opened the trunk, his men gathered around to help him carry the magazines down.</p><br/><p>Pipe took out a cigarette, and Wang Xiaor lit it up.</p><br/><p>\"Be careful with the names. Don\u2019t mix them up. Today there\u2019s a new magazine coming out. Follow our old rules and distribute it to your own newsstands.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Boss, did you have a look at it yet? They have issued an excessive volume.\"</p><br/><p>\"They are just overconfident. The magazines will be returned to the periodical office after a week.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaor\u2019s hand trembled. He was still holding the lighter. My business expands to only two newsstands! What will this mean for me?</p><br/><p>With the cigarette in his mouth, Pipe shouted at his men, \"Shut up! I\u2019m a considerate man! When did I cheat you?\"</p><br/><p>They all sighed in relief. If the stands returned the magazines though, they would have to share the loss. Labor cost was also an expense after all.</p><br/><p>\"Stop with that rubbish! Ask your men to be diligent. It's six already. Hurry up! Carry them away!\"</p><br/><p>They all got to work. The magazines and newspapers were carried away in a short while.</p><br/><p>Countless tricycles left the archway, heading in all directions like tidewater.</p><br/><p>Pipe spat the bottom of his cigarette out and stamped on it with his shoe, preparing to return home.</p><br/><p>A copy of the new magazine was left in his truck. Pipe took it out and saw the gift in the package. It was a red lip gloss.</p><br/><p>Ha! I can give this to my wife as a gift. She\u2019s asking for expensive cosmetics all the time!</p><br/><p>He tore the elegant plastic package, and the lip gloss fell in his hand. He took a look at the cover.</p><br/><p>Those foreign publishers were wealthy and generous. An elegant magazine and a gift that cost 15 yuan.</p><br/><p>Pipe was attracted by VOGUE. The colorful box of the lips gloss was overshadowed by the beautiful model on the cover though.</p><br/><p>Pipe flipped through the pages and closed the magazine again with trembling hands. His eyes were fixed on the cover. That black-and-white photo gave him an unusual feeling.</p><br/><p>He felt like he was 18 again, and he and his wife were hiding in a haystack like they used to do in the summer. It was so romantic and passionate.</p><br/><p>I have to do something for the model on the cover. Pipe picked up his cell phone and dialed a familiar number.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Lao Li? Yes, it's me. The new magazine is out today, yes. VOGUE, the one with the black-and-white cover. I have ordered at least 20 copies for each stand, right? I want an extra 6,000 copies for more than 600 stands. No, no! Not reserved. I want the goods before they\u2019re sold out. There\u2019s enough stock? Great! I\u2019ll count on you!\"</p><br/><p>Pipe let out a long sigh of relief and hung up. He smiled like silly in the quiet and put the lip gloss on Qin Guan's lips before driving home to his wife.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Wang Xiaor was busy cycling. The first stand was really close.</p><br/><p>Lao Zhang, the boss, was throwing away the dam-boards from his stand when he got there. He greeted Wang right away, \"Unload! I\u2019m busy now!\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\" Wang Xiaor responded. He put the magazines and newspapers on a shelf outside the stand.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the first one done. If I hurry up, I could deliver everything before seven o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaor left. Lao Zhang untied the nylon rope and put the magazines and newspapers in order on the shelf according to their different categories.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the stand beside the subway station would experience its peak sale time.</p><br/><p>Hurried office workers would walk to the subway, carrying bags of breakfast.</p><br/><p>Most of them would stand by the newspaper stand to have a look and choose something to read on their long way to work.</p><br/><p>\"A Rayli, please!\" A fashionable young girl was looking at the magazines while taking out her purse.</p><br/><p>\"No, wait a moment.\" Her eyes had been attracted by a black-and-white cover among colorful ones.</p><br/><p>She picked up the magazine from the shelf to see the whole picture.</p><br/><p>Among all the female stars, Qin Guan's face was the most striking.</p><br/><p>With his light eyelashes, blank expression and slightly open lips, he was really a shocking beauty. He was still manly though. He had a slender neck and a beautiful Adam's apple.</p><br/><p>\"I want this one. Oh, there\u2019s a gift? I want two!\"</p><br/><p>I can give one to my friend in the office as a gift. She has the same taste as me. Besides, it\u2019s the first issue. I can't miss such an elegant magazine.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, 30 yuan.\"</p><br/><p>The girl took out three bills and grabbed another copy from the shelf.</p><br/><p>Lao Zhang touched his jaw, as if thinking of something. He looked at the vacancy on the shelf and carried all the VOGUEs outside. He put four more copies in a line on the shelf, making them more obvious. People would be able to see the black-and-white cover among the bright red and green ones from afar.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Qin Guan caressed Gong's smooth cheeks with trembling hands.</p><br/><p>Even though she was a woman in her 40s, she was still a charming actress. Her skin was fine and soft. Qin Guan's hands lingered on its tender land. Their lips were getting closer and closer. Suddenly, Qin Guan thought of his father and came back to his senses.</p><br/><p>This was his father's wife!</p><br/><p>He rolled away and crawled on the floor, leaving the lonely woman with the messy hair behind him.</p><br/><p>\"Good! Cut! How were they?\"</p><br/><p>When the assistants gestured back at him, Director Zhang made a decision.</p><br/><p>\"One more scene, okay?\"</p><br/><p>It was wonderful to work with good actors. They were always energetic because they did not have to repeat scenes. Both Qin Guan and Gong Lee answered positively.</p><br/><p>They would be shooting another scene in the empress' chamber, but Qin Guan had to change his costume before they did.</p><br/><p>Jay Chou took advantage of this to keep practising. He couldn't look inferior to Qin Junyi, who was only 14 years old.</p><br/><p>When the prop team was done, the prince rushed back to the chamber angrily with sweat covering his forehead.</p><br/><p>\"You want to rebel? When?\"</p><br/><p>\"During the banquet.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are killing me! No matter if I succeed or not, everyone will question my authority!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's face twisted in horror, anger and grievance, expressing his tender feelings for the woman. Any other man would have killed her right away, but the coward didn't know what to do. He burst into tears instead.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a professional actor, so his eyes were like a tap he could turn on whenever he wanted. Tears started running down his face, making him look pitiful.</p><br/><p>\"You want me to die...I'll die now then!\"</p><br/><p>He found a dagger in a sewing basket and stabbed his own chest with it without hesitation. At least he had the courage to commit suicide. The blood bag under Qin Guan's clothes broke and blood burst out of his chest as he collapsed on the floor.</p><br/><p>Everyone was satisfied with his performance. When the director shouted at them, Gong Lee helped Qin Guan up. There was blood on his face as the crew congratulated the actors on that day's work.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone is dismissed! Go get some rest at the hotel. Qin Guan, you have some spare time during the next two days.\"</p><br/><p>Actually, most of the actors died by the end of the film.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded and rushed back to the hotel. As for Wang Liying, the lawsuit against \"The Promise\" had already begun.</p><br/><p>The crew was still editing and promoting the film. Meanwhile, the news had gone viral online, outshining even \"Crazy Stone\".</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was worried about his first film. Would it survive a fierce battle against Hollywood blockbusters and the pressure back at home?</p><br/><p>Ning Hao was disappointed with the film's schedule. China Film Group hadn't helped much. Only a few cinemas in Shanghai would screen the film reluctantly in unpopular time slots.</p><br/><p>According to reliable sources, this had something to do with \"The Promise\". What Qin Guan had done had irritated the producer, who had consequently tripped \"Crazy Stone\" up.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that Qin Guan was one of the major shareholders of Huayi, and Tiancheng, which was Huayi's rival, had just set up its headquarters in Shanghai. What a coincidence!</p><br/><p>The two enemies had fixed their eyes on \"Crazy Stone\".</p><br/><p>It was difficult to get Qin Guan in trouble, but a film with a limited budget on the other hand...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went crazy when he heard about the first day's box office in Shanghai.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

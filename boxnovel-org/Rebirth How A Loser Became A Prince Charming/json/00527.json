That splendid moment was definitely worth recording. A South Korean girl recognized Qin Guan from the photos.</p><br/><p>Her roar was like thunder on the silent beach. \"He is Qin Guan Obar [1]! Qin Guan, look at me!\"</p><br/><p>The girl was too excited to control herself. South Koreans were fond of beautiful things, but they went too far. Their obsession over gorgeous designs and their perfection-oriented makeup skills had become a kind of disease.</p><br/><p>As a result, a naturally handsome guy was like a tower of light in the dark for Korean girls. The girl was one of Qin Guan\u2019s loyal fans, who had purchased his album. That was why she was able to recognize him in that strange costume.</p><br/><p>Few people in the audience spoke Korean, but everyone recognized his name.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? Is that his name?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? That sounds familiar.\"</p><br/><p>\"I remember! He was the Best Actor Award winner at Cannes! And remember the fake news scandal in New York?\"</p><br/><p>\"Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Madonna are fans of his...\"</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s a f*cking celebrity!\"</p><br/><p>\"What is he doing here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Just read the posts on OMG. Do you know what he does for a living?\"</p><br/><p>The screams had ignited a bomb. Some audience members began to move towards the stage. Qin Guan realized the situation was out of control. If he tried to escape, there would be a riot on the beach. The play would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>He was aware that escaping was not the best solution. For the sake of the other actors, as well as his career, he couldn't leave before the play was finished.</p><br/><p>The best solution was to tame the audience with an even better performance. Then they would realize that he was not Qin Guan, but Paris himself.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan shouted at the stunned Romeo angrily, \"Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague! Can vengeance be pursued farther than death? Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee: Obey, and go with me; for thou must die!\"</p><br/><p>His thunderous voice brought everyone back to reality.</p><br/><p>Romeo came back to his senses as well. He was familiar with the lines. He had repeated the same lines and actions every day, the passion and dreams of his youth gradually fading away. Suddenly, he found his feelings again.</p><br/><p>The young man was always serious about his performance. As an experienced actor, he felt stimulated by Qin Guan\u2019s sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>He finally felt better. As he recalled his best memories, he no longer felt suppressed by Qin Guan and was able to express his own enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>\"I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man. Fly hence, and leave me; think upon these gone. Let them affright thee, I beseech thee, youth! Put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury!\" he shouted back.</p><br/><p>The shocked audience teared up, and so did the director.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter that theater had a small audience. A shocking performance could always tug at people\u2019s heartstrings.</p><br/><p>Romeo looked a little hysterical. \"I beseech thee, youth! Put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury. O, be gone! By heaven, I love thee better than myself; for I come hither arm'd against myself. Stay not, be gone; live! And hereafter say, a madman's mercy bade thee run away!\"</p><br/><p>The prop master handed two swords to them. They each held one as they stood face to face.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saluted Romeo in a formal manner as they looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Romeo attacked and Qin Guan fought back.</p><br/><p>Violent sparkles flew. There were cruel flames in their eyes as they attacked each other ruthlessly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

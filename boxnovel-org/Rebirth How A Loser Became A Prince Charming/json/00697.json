They silently watched the speaker give a solemn introduction about Qin Guan's glory.</p><br/><p>Although it was not an important award, it was significant for the Asian students of the university, as it gave them a sense of belonging and identity in the city of New York.</p><br/><p>The man on the stage was their representative in their fight for justice.</p><br/><p>The host finished his speech, which was excellent in both intonation and emotion. This was nothing for an American politician. In that country, people had to speak so well that their speeches sounded as pleasant as songs.</p><br/><p>That year, there would be a presidential election. Gunpowder smoke had already appeared in all big cities. Henry and four other policemen stood up, holding an exquisite black box, and waited for Qin Guan on the stage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fixed his tie. As a member of the fashion circle, he had consulted his stylist before the event. He was wearing a gray spring suit that radiated with vigor.</p><br/><p>His tie, which was the exact same color, showed the importance he attached to the ceremony.</p><br/><p>In other words, he looked perfect. He definitely deserved the film the reporters were spending on him.</p><br/><p>\"The winner of the 2004 award is Qin Guan! Congratulations!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked to the center of the stage. Henry pinned the small star-like medal on his chest. The reporters rushed up to the stage like crazy.</p><br/><p>The two men on the stage shook hands.</p><br/><p>\"Well done, Qin Guan!\" shouted the Chinese students.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Look over here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Henry, Senator Lee, could you please get closer?\" the reporters shouted at them.</p><br/><p>The three men stood next to each other shoulder to shoulder to take a formal group photo. When Qin Guan got off the stage, he massaged his stiff face.</p><br/><p>What the hell are they doing? This short ceremony is more tiring than a runway show! It seems like I'm not cut out for politics. Life before cameras is really terrible!</p><br/><p>When he reached the backstage area, Qin Guan took off the medal carefully and put it back in its black case. Then he noticed the policemen leaving with Henry.</p><br/><p>Henry's black car took off first. The other four policemen approached their motorcycles, putting on their white helmets. Qin Guan's eyeballs nearly fell out of their sockets.</p><br/><p>He saw four different flags on the motorcycles, each one for a seperate martial arts club. They all had a different color and logo. When the motorcycles roared to life, the flags spread in the breeze attractively.</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoxiao was familiar with this, and so were the city residents.</p><br/><p>\"After your performance, martial artists received an invitation from police stations all over America,\" Xu explained to his friend patiently. \"People in power are good friends with Chinese masters.\"</p><br/><p>\"You know about the conflicts amid the traditional Chinese martial arts system. No school will ever surrender to another school. As a result, there are also different schools among American policemen. Martial arts fans consider their school their responsibility. They patrol the city with their logo to attract students for their school.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nearly burst into laughter. \"What about Master Guolin?\" he asked on second thought.</p><br/><p>Xu patted his thighs excitedly. \"The night he returned to the temple, he found a crowd gathered outside the gate. Americans had surrounded the temple. They kowtowed together before Master Guolin and elected a guy who spoke fluent Chinese to negotiate with him.\"</p><br/><p>\"It was so funny! Master Guolin likes to keep a low profile though. If he didn't, there would be Buddha bumper stickers on police cruisers all over the city.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shivered at the thought. If arhats filled the streets...</p><br/><p>He hit Xu over the head. \"Do you have enough free time to laugh at others? Just focus on your own task!\" </p><br/><p>Their task was arduous. The community fair was launched ceremoniously at the border between the campus and the community. The fair used Columbia's emblem as its symbol.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

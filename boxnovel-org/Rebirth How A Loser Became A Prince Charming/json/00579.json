First-class food could be compared to a gourmet restaurant menu.</p><br/><p>The delicious food and good wine filled Qin Guan's mouth and mind, making him forget about his annoying fellow traveller. He was completely absorbed in his food.</p><br/><p>When he swallowed the last bite of shrimp, he tried the fresh fish roes. Their taste exploded in his mouth as he narrowed his eyes in content.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Qin Guan. Has anybody told you that you look like a proud Persian cat when you narrow your eyes like that?\"</p><br/><p>It was terrible to have such an annoying companion during such a long journey.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan ignored Chris as Lilian walked out of the kitchen with a basket in her hand. In the basket were all kinds of different snacks.</p><br/><p>They were not the kind of snacks one could find at a supermarket though. There were pickled shrimps and vegetables among them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took several packages out of the basket curiously. When he noticed that Chris was twisting his nose disdainfully, he put some back in the basket.</p><br/><p>Then he opened the first package to reveal its contents. There was a shrimp, a piece of lotus root and two pieces of boiled cabbage inside.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't find anything strange about them as he chewed. He shot a questioning look at Chris.</p><br/><p>\"Only sheep eat cabbage!\"</p><br/><p>Hey, wild kid! You are 10 years older than me, yet you act like a spoiled child! Don't you know that Chinese people have the healthiest diet in the world? Most of their meals are composed of vegetables. Americans eat meat and potatoes every day! That's why there are so many obese people in your country!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't want to pay attention to him anymore. The meal was included in the ticket!</p><br/><p>There were two choices for the main course, Western cuisine and Japanese cuisine. Because of his love for boiled milled rice, Qin Guan chose the Japanese option. Chris chose the other one without hesitation.</p><br/><p>In the plain dishes were fruit, vinegar-boiled scallops, grated radish with fish spawns, sprout tofu and broiled river eel, all of which Chris had never seen before.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan's broccoli soup was served, Chris couldn't control himself anymore.</p><br/><p>He took a careful look at Qin Guan's fine face and then caressed his own tough skin, which was a result of cannabis and wild gay life. He let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\"Are vegetables the reason for your good skin?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\" Qin Guan lied. \"I eat half a kilo of different kinds of vegetables every day. The Chinese include more than eight food groups in their diet to maintain a healthy body.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan began to preach about the mystery of the Chinese diet. When Chris came across some chopped, cooked entrails, he realized it had been a mistake to share a meal with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He stood up to change seats, so that he wouldn't starve.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan accepted the small black bowl Lilian handed him with a smile. The simple girl shivered at his smile.</p><br/><p>That was why Matta had been frustrated. The celebrity was a beautiful monster that tempted people to jump into the void.</p><br/><p>Lilian didn't have contact with passengers during work, but Qin Guan's smile was a curious coincidence that made her happy.</p><br/><p>She placed the Japanese steamed egg and seafood on Qin Guan's table along with the main course before she escaped like a scared rabbit.</p><br/><p>The main course was rice and beef with a thick sauce and an orange boiled egg. It was the most delicious food in the world.</p><br/><p>When he tasted the cold mustard lobster and the conch, Qin Guan felt like an immortal.</p><br/><p>The dessert was just as impressive. Yoghurt with seasonal fruit was the best choice after such a feast.</p><br/><p>After dinner, all the tableware was cleared away. Qin Guan was about to fall into a satisfied sleep.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone broke the silence. Chris and Matta had gotten to know each other well during dinner.</p><br/><p>The two of them exchanged looks filled with fierce emotion. In an effort to get away from Qin Guan, they went into the first-class bathroom together and locked the door from the inside as they kissed.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was totally speechless. That was a small washroom with a thin door, so he could hear what was happening inside clearly.</p><br/><p>\"Come on... Oh!\"</p><br/><p>Timid Lilian closed the curtain as soon as she could to hide them from their curious colleagues, who were craning their necks around to see.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Qin Guan was quite nervous during that season, something his roommates were unable to understand.</p><br/><p>It was Friday, December 25th. A cloudy Christmas.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just a foreign custom, whose only social reflection is Christmas tree decorations in the mall. What the hell are you so excited for?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was brushing his teeth in front of the mirror, thinking to himself helplessly.</p><br/><p>For future reference, if you don\u2019t invite your girlfriend for dinner at Christmas, you might as well get ready to get dumped.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished rinsing his mouth and looked around. No one had taken notice of him. He cupped his hands over his face and blew on them. Well done! His breath was clear and smelled of mint. Everything was ready except Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>They had arranged a meeting time on the phone a long time ago. The plan was to visit a diner on Christmas night in the Modern Plaza on the North Third Ring Road.</p><br/><p>It was cloudy and dark outside at six o\u2019clock in the evening. However, nothing could influence Qin Guan\u2019s good mood. There was a shining, tall Christmas tree on the square in front of the plaza, creating a festive atmosphere.</p><br/><p>As the night fell, the square was lit up by colorful lights. People walked under the Christmas tree, stopping now and then to admire it.</p><br/><p>At the time, Christmas Day, was a fashionable festivity. The lower middle class would have dates or enjoy teatime, while working people kept going about their business.</p><br/><p>This Christmas was incomparably comfortable, lacking any wide advertisements and seasonal businesses.</p><br/><p>This is the scene that greeted Cong Nianwei when she arrived at the entrance of the Modern Plaza.</p><br/><p>A tall young boy, wearing a slim woolen coat, black straight pants and shining black leather shoes was looking around. He seemed lost in thought as he held a bouquet of beautiful roses in his hands. He attracted many a passerby\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Looking at Qin Guan dressed so handsomely, Cong Nianwei burst into laughter. He was reminding her of something.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was looking around the entrance when he saw Cong Nianwei walking towards him from a distance. He was so excited that he forgot the roses in his hands and raised his arms to wave at her.</p><br/><p>Petals fell down miserably. Qin Guan was taken aback. He put down the bouquet to check on them.</p><br/><p>By then, Cong Nianwei had reached him. Smiling and pointing to the roses in Qin Guan\u2019s hands, she asked, \u201cAre those for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe\u2026Yes.\u201d Absorbed in her smile, Qin Guan handed the roses to Cong Nianwei with a blank expression as he said in a low voice, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei took a deep sniff of the flowers and said, \u201cThank you, I appreciate it. So Comrade Qin, what shall we do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan beamed with joy and said, \u201cDinner, definitely. Delicious dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei followed Qin Guan, crossing the road diagonally and heading near the Beijing Institute of Technology.</p><br/><p>There was a T.G.I.Friday\u2019s located there, a renowned western style restaurant suitable for young people. The atmosphere inside was festive. They pushed the door loudly and gave their reservation number. Then Qin Guan led Cong Nianwei leisurely to their reserved table. When they were seated, the waiter appeared with two menus. He stood there waiting to take their order.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei read the menu but could not make a decision. She looked up and asked Qin Guan, \u201cAre you familiar with the restaurant? What are their specialties?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised his head from the menu and said, \u201cThey have some famous dishes. Would you like to try one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei agreed with a nod. Qin Guan snapped his fingers towards the waiter, who ran over. He was wearing more than 20 accessories from head to toe, and they all jangled as he squatted next to their table.</p><br/><p>Yes, you didn\u2019t misread. The squatting service was one of the restaurant\u2019s features. The servants played a leading role using their body language. They would actually squat by the customers or lean on the table to help them decide on their order. All this served to indicate that you didn\u2019t have to straighten your clothes or sit properly there.</p><br/><p>Qin guan was really straightforward. He gave the waiter a long list.</p><br/><p>Buffalo Wings, Baby Back Ribs, Fajitas [1], and a Chicken Caesar Salad.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would you prefer, soup or a soft drink, Cong Nianwei? Would you like that?\u201d Holding his menu, Qin Guan grinned at her enticingly. He pointed to the bar beside their table, where a bartender was performing fancy mixtures of drinks.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei glanced at the menu and said, \u201cLong Island Iced Tea, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw that there was alcohol in Iced Tea, and that made him smile to himself. He ordered two cups of Iced Tea and an extra serving of Baked Sweet Potato Skins.</p><br/><p>Slow American country music was playing as the bartender performed on the customers\u2019 request.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei pulled her chair closer to the table. She supported her jaw with both hands, enjoying the gentle music and having a good time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was extremely satisfied with his effort that day.</p><br/><p>She accepted my roses! She\u2019s having a meal with me!</p><br/><p>It was a good beginning for what would follow.</p><br/><p>Their meal was served quickly. They ate lazily. There wasn\u2019t as much courtesy there as in formal western restaurants. Customers could do anything they wished. You could even grab your ribs with your bare hands without feeling embarrassed.</p><br/><p>They dined and wined to satisfaction and enjoyed another song before they stood up to go.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei waited for Qing Guan to take care of the check with the cashier by the door. Then she asked, \u201cWhat next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stammered, \u201cEh, I\u2019m full. Shall we go for a walk?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished his sentence, he felt the impulse to slap himself in the face. Full? You dull homeboy!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei tittered. It\u2019s really great to be with Qin Guan. She nodded and waved the roses around. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk. I\u2019m full, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Cong Nianwei, Qin Guan boxed himself in the ear gently. His original plan had been to take Cong Nianwei to the plaza and buy a fluffy sheep for her. Once she was happy, it would be easy for him to make a confession.</p><br/><p>But then he\u2019d said that silly thing.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was walking in low spirits when he heard Cong Nianwei cry out in surprise. She had just pushed the door open. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hurried outside and saw the thick snow.</p><br/><p>It must have been snowing for quite a while. Large snowflakes covered the ground, creating a thick layer of snow. Qing Guan stepped forward and found his shoes stuck in the snow. It reached as high as his vamps.</p><br/><p>They lost the mood to take a leisurely walk. The snowfall seemed to get heavier.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan offered his hand to Cong Nianwei as he said, \u201cThe snow is thick. Follow my steps and hold my hand. Be careful not to slip.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was taken aback. She pursed her lips and smiled, \u201cOkay. Take my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan helped Cong Nianwei cross the road carefully. When they reached the bus stop, he realized something. I have held her hand.</p><br/><p>At the thought of this, his hand suddenly became sweaty. Thank God! Thank the God of Snow. I\u2019ll burn three incense sticks in your honor tomorrow!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn\u2019t care about anything else as he held her hand by the bus stop. He pretended to watch the buses. Cong Nianwei tried to pull her hand away gently, but failed. She glanced at Qin Guan and decided to let it be.</p><br/><p>[1] a kind of Mexican staple food. It is the mixture of guacamole, cheese, soft cheese, Mexican tomato and chili sauce and special Mexico corn-flour pancake.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then Qin Guan would share the chocolate with them. It was actually hard for squirrels to find food in spring.</p><br/><p>It was very easy. Qin Guan would just hand the chocolate to the squirrels when the assistant told him to. However, his troublesome nature took effect again, just like it had during the biscuit ad back in China. Back then, the docile golden retriever had refused to eat its dog food. This time, the squirrels rushed over to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The 46 troublemakers saw the human, the chocolate in his hands, and his cantankerous smile clearly. The trained creatures acted together.</p><br/><p>\"Go! Go! Go!\"</p><br/><p>They formed four lines and jumped onto Qin Guan's body. Caught off guard, Qin Guan fell down on the lawn. The chocolate was lost, but the squirrels settled on his stomach. Even his hair became a temporary squirrel nest.</p><br/><p>Everyone was scared by this turn of events, except for the experienced trainer. The fat man just rang the gong.</p><br/><p>His soldiers responded to their master by lining up immediately.</p><br/><p>They gathered in two orderly rows, their claws hanging down both sides of their bodies. Their tails were around their waists, which made them look like students during military training.</p><br/><p>The problem was that they were standing on Qin Guan's body. They were on his legs, along his hip bones, and on top of his chest.</p><br/><p>Amused by his pets' funny behavior, the trainer failed to deliver a third order with his whistle. Instead, he produced a fart-like sound.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha...\"</p><br/><p>The spectacle was so funny that the entire crew burst into laughter. The only sad people among them were Qin Guan and the trainer, whose long faces created a sharp contrast against everyone else's.</p><br/><p>The director finally stopped the camera and watched the playback happily with the manager.</p><br/><p>\"See? We could add some animation there. That would make the ad completely different!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! That's even better than the original script. What a surprise!\"</p><br/><p>\"The chocolate looks more attractive this way. We could also change the commentary to highlight the mouthful of hazelnuts inside the bar!\"</p><br/><p>\"Even squirrels couldn't turn it down...\"</p><br/><p>\"Would anyone feed squirrels chocolate?\"</p><br/><p>\"No way!\"</p><br/><p>They laughed proudly before they turned back to the set, only to see their award-winning actor lying on the lawn.</p><br/><p>Wow! He is certainly a professional actor. He won't move unless the director orders him to!</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan was not that dedicated. He was just horrified. \"Cut!\" shouted the satisfied director. Everyone watched as the handsome young man rolled away with his arms and legs up like Domino cards.</p><br/><p>The clever squirrels jumped off his body right before his first roll, for fear that they would get crushed under his body. They all rushed over to their master for protection.</p><br/><p>\"Help! That bad guy wants to crush us!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan climbed up leisurely, as if there was no one else present. Then he dusted off his clothes and asked Qu, \"Are we finished?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Are they satisfied?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"What are we waiting for then? Run!\"</p><br/><p>He disappeared as fast as he could, leaving behind him a legend. People now thought that Qin Guan had the magical power to change a script for the better.</p><br/><p>After those ads, Qin Guan enjoyed a happy period of just eating and sleeping. He didn't change his lifestyle until his film hit American theaters.</p><br/><p>Posters could be seen in all commercial cinemas and community billboards. As the news about \"Mean Girls\" started spreading online, Qin Guan's team worked with the distributor to promote the film.</p><br/><p>As a teen movie, it naturally attracted a lot of attention from students. Qin Guan was busy writing his thesis during summer vacation. Meanwhile, the promotion was in full swing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

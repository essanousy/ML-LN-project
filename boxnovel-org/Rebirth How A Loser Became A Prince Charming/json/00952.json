We can have more guests next season!\"</p><br/><p>\"Well done!\" Fu Shen nodded confidently. It seemed like he knew what he was doing.</p><br/><p>\"Now, it's Qin Guan's turn.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah-choo!\" Qin Guan sneezed in Armani's studio.</p><br/><p>\"Shall I turn down the air conditioner for you?\" the designer asked his exclusive model. \"It's only early summer. It's a little cold in the morning.\"</p><br/><p>\"Never mind.\" Qin Guan rubbed his nose with a smile. \"Maybe someone is missing me. It seems like my darling has been thinking of me.\"</p><br/><p>If Cong Nianwei, who was busy working at a construction site, had heard that, she would have burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>It was a sweet misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>The news that Qin Guan would go to Venice in the outfit of the winning designer had started spreading around. It was also said that the formal outfit would be donated by Project Runway. After it had served its purpose, it would be auctioned off for charity.</p><br/><p>As a result, the outfit had attracted a lot of attention from buyers.</p><br/><p>Unlike mall store buyers, high-fashion clothing buyers had their own brands or stores with a unique sense of aesthetic and local fame.</p><br/><p>Some of them sold only couture at their stores. Even international limited-edition products would appear there regularly. Some talented designers trusted those buyers to sell their creations, as they preferred quality to quantity.</p><br/><p>That was why the news caused a riot in the circle.</p><br/><p>Everyone invited will be an enemy of mine. I'll fight you with money!</p><br/><p>Thus, 50 more invitations were looted. Some people even trailed after postmen to steal the envelopes!</p><br/><p>At the end of the fashion week, Fu lazily sent the 50 last invitations to famous brands and companies.</p><br/><p>This was an opportunity for people to display their outstanding talent. Any smart businessman would jump at such a chance.</p><br/><p>The crowded site shocked the senior executives of NBC, who could see that Fu Shen was going to have a bright future ahead of him.</p><br/><p>Fu was receiving praise and encouragement from all directions. Meanwhile, Qin Guan was filled with despair backstage.</p><br/><p>He had received the \"Project Runway\" designs. The top three contestants had finished their job. Unfortunately, as a part of the competition, the three of them had been assigned the theme \"primal culture\".</p><br/><p>What had humans worn at the time?</p><br/><p>Everything!</p><br/><p>Prehistoric style was a modern fashion trend whose natural, rough style could inspire any designer.</p><br/><p>In accordance to the theme, all the models were wearing sunburn-resembling paint that made them look like they had gotten a tan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I'm actually impressed with myself. I was brave enough to invite Salvador over for tea...\"</p><br/><p>\"It doesn't matter, Sister Xue. He's a middle-aged man from Sicily. His grandson may be old enough to go to school...\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck off!\"</p><br/><p>The joke cheered everyone up.</p><br/><p>We'll be returning to New York after the fashion week after all. I'm only an ordinary passing traveller. Besides, Armani told me not to think too much.</p><br/><p>The big incident caused by the animal protection organization was spreading online. People were having fun trying to find something interesting in the pictures, especially the ones where everyone was running in a different direction.</p><br/><p>\"I liked this part of the Fashion Week!\" A naked man, protesters... The other fashion weeks were inferior to Milan on this aspect.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! I found Qin Guan in the crowd. He's next to Armani! Wise choice!\"</p><br/><p>People were talking happily about the news while some guys forwarded the official reports from the Italian media.</p><br/><p>\"Look at this! It's so funny!\" In the pictures, Qin Guan was carrying Armani and his assistants.</p><br/><p>The first photo reminded people of the true feeling of being in danger, while the second one was a good depiction of Qin Guan's curious nature.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! I want to know who that strong man is!\"</p><br/><p>\"The woman must be Qin Guan's agent. I've seen her in many pictures on newspapers.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is her stomach all right? Is she still alive?\"</p><br/><p>There was a sea of delight. A lonely user revealed the truth beneath some posts.</p><br/><p>Customer Service: The strong man is Yin Changtao, a Chinese designer. He was invited by the Milan Fashion Week as a promising, talented young man.</p><br/><p>Wow! When did Qin Guan's official blog start offering customer service? The fans swarmed the user like bees.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, boy! Tell us about Qin Guan's schedule!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is his underwear black or white? Tell us, so we know you're not a fraud!\"</p><br/><p>Customer Service: See you tomorrow...</p><br/><p>Rongzhi burst into laughter as he watched the discussion area get messy. This is so amusing!</p><br/><p>It was easy to amuse fans online, but it was very difficult to impress the judges and spectators during the Milan Fashion Week.</p><br/><p>During the day, eight new designers from different countries would be presented one after the other. They had to rely on their ability to attract the audience and the media, as all of them were strangers to the critics.</p><br/><p>They would make their debut on the dazzling stage without being tested in the market first. Would they soar up to the sky or fall down from Heaven? Nobody knew...</p><br/><p>The media and insiders of the fashion circle remained silent, which was a smart choice. Only fashion tycoons expressed their interest openly.</p><br/><p>As a result, the commercial-value-oriented show of those designers started differently than the shows of other brands.</p><br/><p>Those were the circumstances under which Andrew Gn set out for his adventure in Milan.</p><br/><p>All the staff on and off the site were busy working. They were experienced employees sent by the organizing committee, which made Yin, who was walking around nervously backstage, relax a little.</p><br/><p>As a representative of Chinese designers, he had a special collection to present to the audience. There was an one-way glass between the stage and the backstage area, through which he could observe the reaction of the audience.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had changed into his outfit and was standing next to Yin, talking about the audience members, who had already taken their seats.</p><br/><p>\"The media are in the C-1 area, so they can stand up and walk around without bothering anyone else.\"</p><br/><p>\"Most of them are from international fashion magazines and local newspapers. A few popular fashion websites are also in attendance.\"</p><br/><p>Yin calmed down gradually as Qin Guan explained.</p><br/><p>\"Clothing companies and brand representatives are in the A-1 and B-1 areas. They've come here with different goals. The former will be your competitors in the future, but you can also learn from them if you want to design mainstream, mass-consumption clothes.\"</p><br/><p>\"The latter will be your sustenance. They will decide whether your brand will be accepted by the fashion circle.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan saw a familiar figure walk by slowly. What is he doing here? This is like wasting pearls on a pig!</p><br/><p>It was Ye Dong. His ex-roommate took his seat in the B-1 area gracefully. Unlike other people in that area, he began naturally socializing with strangers. He greeted, chatted and flattered others. In five minutes, the people sitting around him began to shake hands with him as if they were old friends.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

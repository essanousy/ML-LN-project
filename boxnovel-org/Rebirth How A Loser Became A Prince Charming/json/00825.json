The studio was their holy land. That day, it had welcomed a very special person. He was an outsider of the music circle, but a f*cking award-winning indie actor.</p><br/><p>They all gathered in the studio curiously. Gao read the program of the gala. He went mad when he saw Qin Guan's song.</p><br/><p>\"You'll sing this song during the gala?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you kidding me? Is that 'Book of Family Names'?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. At least that's what they told me. If you don't understand, I have numbered the musical notes here.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is an insult! Even a nursery rhyme would be better. Neither has a beat, or any ups and downs. This is for stars from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan? What the hell...\"</p><br/><p>Underground musicians worshipped rock and folk music. The song in Gao's hands was really terrible, but the mainstream tune had been created especially for the Spring Festival Gala. The audience would be common people.</p><br/><p>I came here to learn from you, I'm not asking you to cover the song!</p><br/><p>Gao Xiaosong cursed his way out of the studio. Then he put on his earphones to listen to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Heaven, Earth, dignified and imposing Chinese hearts</p><br/><p>The state of China has a long history</p><br/><p>My family name is Li, and yours is Zhang</p><br/><p>Huanghe River and Yangtze River are flowing in our blood...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sang seriously inside as the audience outside laughed loudly. The solemn mainstream lyrics were like a square peg in a round hole there. They sounded really weird.</p><br/><p>Plenty of people rushed there to watch the funny recording, including Wang Feng, Pu Shu and other famous singers.</p><br/><p>Gao laughed so hard that he had to lie down on the couch. Wang Feng, who was a kinder man, tried to remain neutral.</p><br/><p>\"CCTV is good at selecting singers. None of us could sing this song well. It's only suitable for a handsome guy like him.\"</p><br/><p>Gao couldn't stand to watch the shameless man. He suddenly spat at Wang's feet. You! Save some dignity for us rockers!</p><br/><p>By the time they turned their attention to Qin Guan again, he had finished the song.</p><br/><p>\"You have to memorize the lyrics. Try not to be out of tune! Is it a live show?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Is your performance followed by a big dance performance?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded again.</p><br/><p>\"You just need to be more handsome than your partners. All the cameras will be on you. The song is not important.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried to picture the scene in his mind, so he had a general idea about the large-scale gala. The cameras would concentrate on the most famous person, which made him less nervous.</p><br/><p>His extraordinary memory would work well in that occasion. He just had to focus on the tune of the song. These professional singers didn't scold me. It seems that my singing is pretty good.</p><br/><p>He walked out of the studio and chatted a little with the singers. He was a rich man on the Forbes list, so those poor guys worshipped him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made vigorous efforts to talk about piracy, which was getting more and more rampant, but Gao was a smart guy, so he focused on singers instead of on companies.</p><br/><p>If one wanted to promote a singer, they could invest in them, release their records, organize concerts and so on. The sponsors could see the potential of the capital. Thanks to Qin Guan's help, more and more singers would avoid trouble and present better music to the masses.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to experience this win-win situation first hand. The musical department of his firm would welcome fresh blood.</p><br/><p>The small firm, which had started out with just Qin Guan and Huang Bo, now monopolised 67% of the domestic modelling resources. His decision that day would earn the firm the title \"Musician Scout\" in the future.</p><br/><p>Let's leave that part for later though. Qin Guan said goodbye to Gao Xiaosong and the other singers, unaware of their choked laughter, and headed to the grand hall of CCTV.</p><br/><p>At the time, it had still been located on Fuxingmen Street. The parking lot was really crowded due to the rehearsal.</p><br/><p>A group of beautiful girls got off a bus with the logo \"Central Nationalities Song and Dance Troupe\". The dancers looked like flowers in the winter. Qin Guan's car was stuck among them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

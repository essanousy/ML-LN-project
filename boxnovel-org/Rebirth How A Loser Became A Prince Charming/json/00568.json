The next scene was very important. It was the only scene where all four actors would appear together, so it was the most essential scene of the film.</p><br/><p>It was a clash among four talented actors, as well as a feast of excellent shooting skills.</p><br/><p>The role of Alice, which was the smallest part, was played by Natalie Portman, a famous former child star whose first role had been the female lead in \"Leon The Professional\". This was proof enough of her acting skills.</p><br/><p>The two groups met on the set. This would be the first and last time Qin Guan would see all the actors of the film in one place.</p><br/><p>Jude Law and Natalie Portman got out of a business car and waved at Nichols warmly.</p><br/><p>They all realized that this was an arena. They had to defend their honor with all their power.</p><br/><p>Nichols could sense the tense atmosphere between the four actors. He didn't care about it though. He just led them over to the set slowly.</p><br/><p>He had rented the exhibition hall at a very high price. Maybe the actors\u2019 competitiveness would save the crew some money.</p><br/><p>The exhibition hall was inside a famous gallery in London. The prop team had transformed it completely though.</p><br/><p>Large portraits were sparkling in the modern hall as the black-and-white photos told unique stories to the audience. The hall looked beautiful under the light of the LED screen.</p><br/><p>Satisfied with the prop team\u2019s work, Nichols asked the actors to get ready as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Their performances had better be worthy of the fine set.</p><br/><p>When they got out of the fitting room, the prop master felt distressed. All of them were dressed in expensive high-end attire. He just hoped that they deserved all these expenses.</p><br/><p>The director seemed to know what he was thinking, so he asked the crew to get into position and begin shooting.</p><br/><p>\"Get ready! Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>At his order, the four gifted actors immediately got into character.</p><br/><p>One of the cameras followed Qin Guan as he approached Natalie.</p><br/><p>The successful guy was wearing a black silk shirt and a grey suit. He had not felt like wearing a tie to a photography exhibition.</p><br/><p>The first two buttons of his shirt were unfastened, expressing his self-confidence.</p><br/><p>Holding a glass of champagne in his hand, he fixed his eyes on the beautiful girl with the black hair.</p><br/><p> Nice prey...</p><br/><p>He walked over to Natalie. The woman was wearing a black backless dress and vintage hair jewellery. Her sexy shoulders were exposed, and the cigarette in her hand was telling stories about her.</p><br/><p>The lonely couple expressed their own feelings before Julia\u2019s photos.</p><br/><p> \"What do you think of the man in the photo?\"</p><br/><p>The rebellious girl smiled. Her long earrings were swaying slightly, as if sneering at Qin Guan's words.</p><br/><p>She was a lively woman living at the bottom of society.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan got serious about his performance. That actress was like a gift from Heaven. She was a muse herself. Unlike other actresses, she had been born to perform.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to try his best to catch up with her.</p><br/><p>This was his second commercial film, but this supporting role required better acting skills than his leading role in \"Mean Girls\" had.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to make a big leap.</p><br/><p>Summoning all his powers, he tried to act like a confident, upper-class man.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he had met a lot of men like that in his line of work, so he just applied what he had learned to his performance.</p><br/><p>He watched the woman criticize the photos with a subtle smile and an aggressive desire to conquer her.</p><br/><p>\"The concept of this artwork is aiming at people like you. Liars! All liars! The strangers look beautiful in the photos. They are meant to satisfy those vulgar bastards who pretend to be art lovers. This is exactly what they like.\"</p><br/><p>The camera was shooting from Natalie\u2019s point of view, so the audience would only be able to see Qin Guan's back. Nichols found Qin Guan's expression both funny and annoying.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I know you were waiting for Wang Biyun in Taiwan, so I changed my name to Wang Biyun.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gripped Li's employee card with trembling hands before standing up excitedly. His heart was heavy with love, but the secret love he felt was hurting him deeply.</p><br/><p>\"Why did you change your name?\"</p><br/><p>Li cried out as tears started running down her cheeks. She looked ugly, unlike Xu, who had sobbed gently when she and Qin Guan had separated.</p><br/><p>Li was crying as unrestrainedly as a boy.</p><br/><p>\"What was I supposed to do? You only have Wang Biyun in your heart. It's hopeless! You'll wait for her until you die. I pity you!\"</p><br/><p>That was her heartfelt wish.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was about to stuff a cigarette in his mouth with trembling hands. He was helpless and confused, shocked by the woman in front of him.</p><br/><p>He was struggling mentally to make the most important decision of his life. This was much more serious than a battle.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan stood up, the cameraman stepped back to get the couple in the same frame. Their great love made them seem much taller than they really were.</p><br/><p>\"Don't wait for her!\" Li put a white scarf around Qin Guan's neck. She had weaved it especially for him.Then she suddenly put her hands on his chest.</p><br/><p>\"This waiting has made you suffer.\"</p><br/><p>Li hugged the man from behind. She was also suffering by waiting for him.</p><br/><p>She had turned from an 18-year-old rosebud to a mature woman in her 30s. She had waited for him alone, and so had he. He had been longing for his fiancee, but his cruel eyes had betrayed the softness in his heart.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's eyes closed slowly.</p><br/><p>\"Wang Jindi!\"</p><br/><p>\"Call me Wang Biyun!\" she said vigorously.</p><br/><p>Tears started running down his face too as he lost control.</p><br/><p>Wang Liying raised an eyebrow proudly at Li's agent. Do you see that? My boss can cry too!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to Li slowly, his tears covering his face like small streams. He looked at Li as if he was looking at another girl far away. Li hugged him again fiercely.</p><br/><p>\"I'll take good care of you. I'll spend my entire life caring for you in her stead!\"</p><br/><p>At her words, Qin Guan started kissing her lips like crazy.</p><br/><p>The camera moved around them, filming the kiss from different angles. Qin Guan started weeping as he kissed her with all his strength. This was no new love. He was just cherishing an old fading romance.</p><br/><p>Thus, Chen Qiushui and Wang Biyun formed a love triangle on the Tibetan Plateau.</p><br/><p>A boy that looked like Chen Qiushui became Wang Biyun's only consolation when she immigrated to the other side of the ocean.</p><br/><p>By that time, Gui Yalei had taken over the role. Qin Guan and Li Bingbing died in a snow avalanche on the Tibetan Plateau. Many years later, Qin Guan experienced another exciting on-screen death. The marvellous might of nature couldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as knives and swords.</p><br/><p>The two of them did not actually experience a real avalanche. That would have been suicide. They had just stood on the foot of a mountain and acted scared before the camera.</p><br/><p>They didn't give a good enough performance though. The expression on their faces was so strange that Director Yin had to use his trump card.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, please! The Tibetan restaurant is closing soon. If we don't finish as soon as possible, we'll have instant noodles for dinner!\"</p><br/><p>As excepted, Qin Guan and Li panicked.</p><br/><p>\"They told me we'd be having buns and Tibetan pork tonight!\"</p><br/><p>What the f*ck! The actors looked really frightened and remained like that for about 20 seconds.</p><br/><p>As soon as Director Yin turned off the camera, he realized that one of them had disappeared. Qin Guan had rolled down the snow slope to catch up with the returning car. Li Bingbing tried to stop him by pulling him down to the ground.</p><br/><p>Those buns were homemade and that pork was really rare.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

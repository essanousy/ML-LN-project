They didn't take pictures of you for a long time either?\"</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan had been the focus of the cameras, but he replied against his will, \"Yes, I was done with the red carpet fast. They didn't pay much attention to me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly!\" Feng Gong patted the arm of his chair. \"They only photographed a handsome man like me for 30 seconds and then told me to keep walking!\"</p><br/><p>You must have been blocking someone else.</p><br/><p>\"It looks like we are partners in misery...\"</p><br/><p>Thank you so much...</p><br/><p>The two of them talked happily. The first three rows of seats were filled fast. Officials from the Ministry of Culture and other film industries were sitting in the first row, and famous mainstream directors and producers occupied the next two rows. When they were all seated, silence slowly prevailed in the hall. No one wanted to make a bad impression on those guys.</p><br/><p>Thus, the main hall of the Beijing Exhibition Center was as silent as a grave.</p><br/><p>The nervous atmosphere was eased by the rising of the curtain. Qin Guan felt like he was not at an award ceremony, but a film circle auction. Everyone used this event as an opportunity to market themselves.</p><br/><p>Fan Pingping was the event's guest of honor. Director Chen Kexin was standing next to her.</p><br/><p>\"I like Director Chen's work. I hope he could give me a chance in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Kexin forced a smile at the meaningful expression in the audience's eyes and changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\"The Best Actress of the 12th award ceremony is... Li Bingbing!\"</p><br/><p>The honest girl had finally succeeded after so much effort. She had already left her opponent Xu Ruoxuan far behind.</p><br/><p>People had originally considered Fan the cleverest person at the ceremony, but a second guest of honor made them change their minds.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wei, who had used to be a big-shot on the Chinese mainland, was not as confident as Li Bingbing now. Her terrible line delivery and typecasting made her struggle in her career. As she was standing on the stage with kung fu superstar Jet Li, she wanted to struck a couple of poses. She wanted to show that she was also good at martial arts, even though she was wearing a formal dress.</p><br/><p>She just wanted to give him this information with the prospect of cooperating with him in the future.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Jet Li was not as polite as Chen Kexin. He only talked about One Foundation. While he was on the stage, he kept asking everyone to donate money to charity.</p><br/><p>He understood Zhao Wei's eagerness though. She just wanted to dip her feet in the river and take advantage of his influence in Hollywood.</p><br/><p>The straightforward man gave her a perfunctory response. \"I'm just an actor, I'm not a director or a producer. I do not cast actors for films.\"</p><br/><p>Only this confident man would dare say no to the popular actress.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, we'll talk about this later. Now let's focus on tonight's real heroes. The nominated actors of the 12th award ceremony are Wang Wufu, Feng Gong, Fu Dalong and Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"The lucky guys are Fu Dalong and Qin Guan! Let's give them a round of applause!\"</p><br/><p>Another double-yolked egg! Two out of the four candidates had won an award.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got on the stage. Unlike the previous winners, he expressed his sincere appreciation for everyone involved in the film. It seemed like he was clear about the situation. It was the government that had given him this chance. During previous ceremonies, he had mentioned his girlfriend repeatedly, but he remained silent about her this time.</p><br/><p>After his speech, he stepped back behind the host and the guests of honor and listened to the other actor's speech humbly.</p><br/><p>He stayed like this until he got off the stage. He remained shy and silent as he walked past the first three rows.</p><br/><p>What excellent acting skills! Qin Guan didn't need to flatter the directors. He had a shelf of scripts in his office. Plus, he was a producer himself! He could produce his own films if he wished.</p><br/><p>He also won awards for the film he had produced. \"Crazy Stone\" won the Best Film Award and Ning Hao won the Best New Director Award. For a film with a budget of only 4.5 million, this was no disappointment.</p><br/><p>Everyone used the Ornamental Column Awards to ensure future box office success.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

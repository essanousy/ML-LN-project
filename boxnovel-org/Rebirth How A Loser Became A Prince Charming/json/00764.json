The Best Supporting Actor is...\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone started shouting and applauding, showing their sincere appreciation for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>This final confirmation made Qin Guan relax. He stood up and fixed his bowtie elegantly. As he was about to walk to the stage, Jim held the award up.</p><br/><p>\"Quick! There are so many people staring at it... If you don't get here in three seconds, I'll give it to the guy behind you.\"</p><br/><p>Of course, his words didn't mean anything, but the audience kicked up a fuss. Some women even waved at Jim. \"Or you could give it to the Best Supporting Actress!\"</p><br/><p>Before their voices could fade away, Qin Guan rushed to the stage like the wind, counting backwards to himself, \"Three, two, one... I'm here. Give me the award!\"</p><br/><p>His long legs were a huge physical advantage.</p><br/><p>Everyone was looking at him in shock. When they came back to their senses, their laughter became even louder.</p><br/><p>According to tradition, the host had to surrender the floor to the winner so they could deliver a short speech.</p><br/><p>Jim Carrey didn't do that though. At first, he left the center of the stage, but then he sneaked up behind Qin Guan and the podium, his head peeking around it. Before Qin Guan could say anything, he murmured quickly, \"Jim Carrey is very forgetful. Because of his poor memory, he just missed some important cues. The nominated films include 'Kill Bill II', 'Sideways'...\"</p><br/><p>The unreliable man had forgotten the process of the ceremony.</p><br/><p>In a few seconds, he had finished his task like a robot and squatted down to polish Qin Guan's shoes.</p><br/><p>\"You are welcome. Here, I'll make it up to you.\"</p><br/><p>The audience started laughing even louder.</p><br/><p>Jim Carrey finished his performance and left the stage to Qin Guan, who was the real hero. He just couldn't help it. He'd had to clean his shoes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan deserved that. In a few seconds, all the talented people in the hall had concentrated on him. Everyone had completely forgotten about Jim's joke.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took advantage of this to begin his speech.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, everyone. I'm Qin Guan. I'm very happy to be here during the Chinese Spring Festival. I have now taken one step further towards my dream of winning every film award in existence. This award will help me along to my final destination.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know most of you. Some of you have even worked with me. Anyone who has met me knows that I'm a practical man. I concentrate on the value of the award, regardless of the nature of the role. If you are a director or producer and you are worried about the importance of a role, just come to me. If it's a good one, I'll do it.\"</p><br/><p>A director under the stage answered, as if they had rehearsed beforehand.</p><br/><p>\"You could pick any script you want. Everyone says that you are blessed. I would direct any script you liked.\"</p><br/><p>A producer interrupted him, \"No! I'd produce it. Just save your money to buy your kid some milk powder.\"</p><br/><p>The audience laughed again.</p><br/><p>\"We'll talk in private later,\" Qin Guan answered naturally. \"Now I have to thank some people.\"</p><br/><p>\"I would like to express my gratitude to all the members of the crew. It was your collective effort that helped me win this award. I also want to thank the director and Julia Roberts. You chose me out of countless actors, so I'll always give you and your films priority.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was really charismatic.</p><br/><p>The actor took a deep bow before the audience and ended his speech. Later, his film won two more awards for its cinematography and musical score. It was a pity that the leading actor and supporting actress failed to win an award.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

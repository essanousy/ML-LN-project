His presence added charm to the landscape and made the audience yearn for that wonderland and feel anxious to be in the same place with him.</p><br/><p>When the live Chinese dance, music, martial arts and folk art show came to an end, nearly all the fashion media in America published articles about Qin Guan's return to China. </p><br/><p>Although a press conference was about to take place in China, the arrogant, restrained American film critics were the first to feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>They had not expected this. The Chinese actor had planted roots in America, and the exclusive film circle had gradually accepted him. Why would he choose to return to China and abandon a bright future in the US? In their opinion, the Chinese film circle was practically primitive. What the hell had attracted Qin Guan to it?</p><br/><p>Conspiracy theories started spreading among the netizens, who always remained open-minded.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan has been secretly detained and is being escorted back to China!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is under high-tech brain control. He has lost his memory!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan broke up with his high school sweetheart and wants to escape from this city because it's full of memories...\"</p><br/><p>However, an announcement on his official blog attracted the fans' attention.</p><br/><p>\"There will be a press conference regarding Qin Guan's return home. The link of the live broadcast will be on his international website...\"</p><br/><p>It seems that Qin Guan has really gone back to China. That heartless guy didn't even give us a chance to send him off properly!</p><br/><p>\"If he doesn't give a valid reason for his return, I... I'll protest before the Chinese embassy!\"</p><br/><p>The post appeared immediately on the forum and received thousands of kudos. The staff of the Chinese embassy wiped beads of sweat off their foreheads as they sat before their computer screens.</p><br/><p>According to the statistics, fans from more than 30 states and cities, including remote Southern California, had decided to participate in the demonstration.</p><br/><p>Please, Brother Qin! Give them a valid reason during the press conference, or our embassy will suffer the consequences...</p><br/><p>Thanks to Rongzhi and his outstanding technological skills, the video was released to the fans. Suddenly, hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world poured into the blog. The server was nearly overwhelmed. The video did not load fast enough, but the fans were still satisfied. They were actually very easy to satisfy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a seat. The background behind him was covered with logos of shameless popular brands. Tiffany and Armani had fought over the best placement. The conference had even more sponsors than the European Champions League.</p><br/><p>This was actually completely unnecessary. The background was not the center of the attention. All the reporters pointed their cameras and microphones at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>His status in the circle, as well as Huayi's effort, had made both domestic and foreign reporters fight fiercely over the limited invitations of the small-scale conference. In the end, only 100 invitations had been sent out.</p><br/><p>All the reporters present were the best of the best, so they had prepared really well for the conference.</p><br/><p>The host spoke up first, making an official introduction before he retired to the backstage area.</p><br/><p>\"The conference will last 30 minutes. During the first 10 minutes, Qin Guan will be announcing his return and explaining the reason behind it. The rest of the time will be reserved for questions. Now, I'll leave the floor to Mr. Qin Guan, the real hero of this conference!\"</p><br/><p>A thunderous applause followed his short speech. All the reporters were shouting in their minds, \"Thank you so much! Now go away!\"</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan picked up the microphone, everyone fell silent.</p><br/><p> The Chinese reporters looked at the man on the stage. Long time no see...</p><br/><p>As he looked at the cameras and raised faces in the crowd, Qin Guan felt the deeper meaning of the words \"returning home\".</p><br/><p>He let out a long sigh and then began his sincere speech.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, everyone. I'm Qin Guan. I think you all know me, so I will skip the self-introduction.\"</p><br/><p>\"You came to this conference today to find out the real reason behind my return, so I will give you a sincere explanation.\"</p><br/><p>\"The official reason is that my studies in America have entered a new phase. I do not need to attend any lectures anymore, so I can spend more time on my career and family. My love for my motherland made me return to her embrace without hesitation.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm not such a great man after all. I have missed my home and my parents' cooking. I've missed the local accent and the traditional code of conduct...\"</p><br/><p>\"A man living far from his hometown becomes homesick. Some people may not understand this, but the Chinese believe that a successful man should return to his hometown. Otherwise, his victory will be as boring as a dull night parade.\"</p><br/><p>\"I just want to enjoy the attention of my compatriots!\"</p><br/><p>His confession immediately closed the gap between him and the media.</p><br/><p>The Chinese felt proud of the people that succeeded in foreign countries. Even though Qin Guan was a rising star in the Euromerican film industry, he had returned to China to continue his career, which was very admirable.</p><br/><p>The reporters were taking notes like crazy as Qin Guan's speech moved everyone in the room.</p><br/><p>\"I actually made my final decision when I saw the development of the Chinese film and fashion circle. The status of Chinese filmmakers is rising in the world. There are so many people working hard for this industry, but I'll be really happy to make my own contribution. It's my responsibility after all.\"</p><br/><p>\"I do not want to miss the year that Chinese films soared. One day, the film industry of this great country may compete against Hollywood. When that time comes, I hope that my name will be mentioned, along with thousands of other hard-working actors and directors who helped achieve this milestone. It will be an honor for me, a descendant of Yan and the Yellow Emperor.\"</p><br/><p>The audience grew serious as he voiced his ambition. Suddenly, Qin Guan changed his tune.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, with great power comes great responsibility. I started out my career as a model, so I will try to lead more and more Asian models towards the Western fashion circle. My firm will give you a more detailed explanation later. You can also find information in the material handed out to you. Please look at it and remind me next time. Meanwhile, I'll keep moving towards my destination.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks a lot!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

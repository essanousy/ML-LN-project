Because of the limitation of her looks, she played different servant girls in different plays.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan\u2019s rebirth, she had been in that situation for more than ten years, failing to get any good roles in a show.</p><br/><p>She had appeared in about 100 plays, and the audience had recognized her, but never remembered her name. Was her name too simple? Or was the black spot on her lips too ugly?</p><br/><p>Both of them were hard-working, but Qin Guan was much luckier than her. One advertisement of his equalled ten of her shows.</p><br/><p>They had acted together before, so the scene went a lot smoother.</p><br/><p>Feeling drunk, Jia Lian walked into Xiao Hong's room and attempted to molest her. When Jia Yun entered Xiao Hong's room, he immediately hid under the bed.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Qin Guan's roommates saw him act like that. He was evil and concupiscent. Qin Guan hugged Xiao Hong, and Liu Xiaoyang took out his cell phone and snapped photos like crazy. He would use those photos in the future.</p><br/><p>Jia Lian wanted to do something, but Pingr ran into the room to stop him.</p><br/><p>Jumping to a conclusion, the boys said, \"F*ck! Is she the producer\u2019s girlfriend? Why is she in every scene?\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! If that\u2019s the producer\u2019s taste... Okay, forget it. Just watch Qin Guan. Leave the gossip for later.\"</p><br/><p>The director was satisfied with their performance. \"Prepare for the next scene!\" he shouted at the prop master. \"Lian and Xiao Hong will talk secretly about their wedding!\"</p><br/><p>\"What the hell?\" Mu Lejiang was nearly scared to death by his words. Xiao Hong and Jia Lian were having an affair? I\u2019ll kill the scriptwriter! I can't bear it! That\u2019s evil!</p><br/><p>Jia Lian was a pig in the original work. It was common for him to molest servant girls, but make love with Xiao Hong?</p><br/><p>That f*cking show was known for its creative script. It was supposed to be about servant girls who rebelled against feudalistic oppression.</p><br/><p>The others stopped him. They didn't want to lose the chance to watch such a funny show. Liu Xiaoyang hid among the crew members to get a good angle to take photos.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was teaching Huang a lesson. \"Don\u2019t learn from Qin Guan. He\u2019s a money-grabber. I\u2019ll check for offers for you in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Huang was a good boy. \"No problem! I\u2019ll take any show if it pays well.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was worried about him. One money-grubber went away, and another one came. Huang\u2019s only advantage was his free nature. Qin Guan put too many restrictions on himself. Judging by Huang's behavior, she thought she would get more profit out of him.</p><br/><p>The scene changed. Qin Guan and Xiao Hong were talking under the candlelight. \"Sure, I\u2019ll marry you. But I\u2019m too busy these days. Besides, I don\u2019t have any money.\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Hong was wearing white pajamas and smoothing her long hair with her fingers. \"I know Wang Xifeng has a new idea to make money. I\u2019ll tell you if you marry me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Tomorrow I\u2019ll report to the Madam. If we succeed, I\u2019ll marry you.\"</p><br/><p>Mu Lejiang was pulled away from the site by his friends, tears covering his face.</p><br/><p>You should get a concubine, not get married!</p><br/><p>Nobody understood his sorrow. Qin Guan hugged Xiao Hong, who was not wearing much. Liu Xiaoyang's breathing quickened, but he didn't stop snapping pictures.</p><br/><p>Li Qian was lost in Qin Guan's charming smile. Following her heart, she fell on the bed in Qin Guan's arms.</p><br/><p>All the actresses around were shouting in their minds, \"Let Qin Guan go! Let me try instead!\"</p><br/><p>The scene ended with a shot of a red candle.</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\" Qin Guan immediately tried to get up from the bed, but Li Qian was pulling on his clothes.</p><br/><p>She winked at him and asked in a low voice, \"Do you want a girlfriend in the entertainment circle?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked. He had kept his distance from everyone in the crew for a long time. What was happening now?</p><br/><p>It was very simple. Partners in former TV shows were considered VIPs. Besides, those were older women.</p><br/><p>On the set of \"Grace Princess\", Fang Pingping had protected him like a tigress. Nobody had dared approach him.</p><br/><p>On the set of \"Romance Across Space and Time\", Qin Guan had had to shuttle between three studios, so he\u2019d had no time to chat with other people. Li Qian had noticed him during that show, but had failed to approach him because of his busy schedule.</p><br/><p>Now they were partners though! His handsome face lingered in her mind.</p><br/><p>I could show off with such a handsome boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about her thoughts. He jumped out of bed, as if being stung by a scorpion. Keeping a distance of three metres from her and trying to look calm, he said, \"I already have a girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qian smiled and leaned against the bedside table. \"There\u2019s nothing to be nervous about. You can just select the best one.\" She raised her beautiful eyes up to him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took several steps back and answered her seriously, \"I\u2019m planning on proposing to my girlfriend. This is only about work, not romance.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qian doubted he was a virgin. Her interest was aroused even more.</p><br/><p>She used her acting skills on Qin Guan. With a luring, soft glance, she said, \"Would you like a trial before the wedding ceremony? I\u2019m volunteering.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

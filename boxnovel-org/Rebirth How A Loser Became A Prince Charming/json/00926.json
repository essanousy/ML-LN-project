The black-and-white suit he was wearing was so elegant that the audience felt dazzled.</p><br/><p>His face, his perfect figure, his smile... Everything about him shocked the crowd, who waved at the angel like crazy. The whole world served as a background for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He walked on the stage like a diamond touching velvet and stood straight as a pine between the microphone and the background. Time seemed to stand still for a moment.</p><br/><p>\"Hi, everyone. I'm Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"We know! We know!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved back with a smile. His steady voice echoed around the square.</p><br/><p>\"It's my honor to meet the criteria of the committee and become the fourth Chinese actor to have a star here. I would like to salute Anna May Wong, Bruce Lee and John Woo, who achieved this before me. They are the pride of Chinese filmmakers. As their successor, I will try to never embarrass the Chinese people. I'll try my best to remain on par with the stars on this avenue.\"</p><br/><p>\"I would also like to express my appreciation to the friends who came here especially for the ceremony. I owe my success to you and your help.\"</p><br/><p>\"Secondly, I would like to thank my directors, producers and partners. All of you helped me get my handprints here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Lastly, I want to thank the reporters, who have always been nice to me. I owe my popularity and box office success to your love.\"</p><br/><p>\"I love all my fans. Are you guys looking forward to my new film?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\" was the united response of the fans.</p><br/><p>\"We'll go watch whatever film you star in!\"</p><br/><p>Inspired by the crazy fans, some reporters turned away from the celebrities and pointed their cameras at the crowd to capture the unprecedented scene.</p><br/><p>It was true that China had a really large population. No ceremony on the avenue had ever attracted such a big audience before.</p><br/><p>\"Let's move on. The host is waiting.\"</p><br/><p>The host took the microphone and walked off the stage with Qin Guan. The two of them walked half a meter from the stage, to a spot that was covered by a red square cloth.</p><br/><p>\"Pull it back with me, Mr. Qin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's reveal the star! In three, two, one!\"</p><br/><p>The cloth was pulled away and Qin Guan's star was revealed.</p><br/><p>It was a large bronze star with a black-marble background. Qin Guan's signature was carved in the middle. There was also a line of words under the star, detailing the actor's glorious achievements.</p><br/><p>From then on, Qin Guan's fans would have one more place dedicated to their idol. When they visited Hollywood, they wouldn't forget to take a picture with the star.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the only actor from the Chinese mainland that had a star after all. He was the only one!</p><br/><p>The tourists grew more excited as they gazed at the star.</p><br/><p>If I press my hands there, it would be as if I was shaking hands with Qin Guan. Wow!</p><br/><p>\"Can we take a picture with you and your star in the same frame?\"</p><br/><p>That was not an easy feat. Qin Guan was 1.86 meters tall, so he couldn't fit in the same frame as the star, which was on the ground. Plus, his formal suit would make it hard to squat down.</p><br/><p>Everyone seemed to have forgotten about Qin Guan's profession. He was a top model, so this was no trouble for him.</p><br/><p>He just lay down on the ground next to the star.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

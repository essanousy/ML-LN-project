Fans started shouting like mad.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! It's Qin Guan! I love you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Look at me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wasn\u2019t affected by the voices. With professional equanimity, he turned around and stretched his arms towards Li Bingbing. Her fair fingers touched his black suit.</p><br/><p>It was like an immortal standing by a red lotus. The gods almost cried from the shock of the beautiful scene.</p><br/><p>Raindrops kept pattering. Li Bingbing murmured to herself, \"Bad luck.\"</p><br/><p>They were not influenced by the rain though as they walked slowly along the red carpet.</p><br/><p>However, Li's high heels slowed them down a bit. Before they could reach the middle of the carpet, another girl had stepped on it.</p><br/><p>She was a green hand recently discovered by a talent agent. She raised her eyebrow to the pair up front.</p><br/><p>Bad luck! Their popularity will defeat mine! Judging by their speed, by the time they finish the carpet, I\u2019ll have walked more than half of it. How dare she walk with Qin Guan when she\u2019s so short!</p><br/><p>The beautiful girl stuck out her breasts. She was 170 centimeters and she looked very slender on her average heels.</p><br/><p>She breathed in and walked forward along the carpet with her most charming smile. She was wearing a golden custom-made wrapped skirt. Better walk fast and steal the show.</p><br/><p>She walked with vigorous strides, showing off her booty.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan and Li had reached the other end of the carpet. The hosts welcomed them and handed them a signing pen. Qin Guan signed on the background, his shining diamond sleeve buttons showing as he moved his hand.</p><br/><p>The small stones looked splendid under the flashes of the cameras.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his signature and gave the pen to Li. Taking the chance, the host passed the microphone to him.</p><br/><p>\"Is this your first time attending the Silver Eagle Festival?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Last year, \u2018Daming Palace\u2019 had been nominated. Why didn't you attend the ceremony? Was it because the crew hadn\u2019t nominated you for any awards?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had been expecting that question. Straightening his back, he answered with his trademark smile, \"Director Li had asked for my opinion. I made the decision not to attend for personal reasons. The show had only been nominated for best TV series, not for individual actor performances.\"</p><br/><p>The host suddenly seemed enlightened. \"Well, have you played any roles in a TV series this season?\"</p><br/><p>You troublemaker! Qin Guan looked at Wang Jingcao, who was waiting by the entrance. Wang gestured, trying to comfort him.</p><br/><p>Li returned the pen to the host. \"Hey, Zhao Liang! This is discrimination! Interview me too!\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Liang looked awkward about the interruption, but changed the topic.</p><br/><p>The girl behind Qin Guan and Li followed them gloomily as they walked along the red carpet. They had attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>She cast a glance at them and saw Li talking with the host. She was too far to hear clearly and thought that Li was stealing the show.</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s name was Liu Jia, and she was the big-boobs-no-brain type.</p><br/><p>If Li is stealing the show, I should copy her!</p><br/><p>She took action immediately. Before Qin Guan and Li could leave, she reached the background.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the actor behind Liu Jia was happy. She was the only actress on the red carpet, so it was a good chance to show off!</p><br/><p>Before she could jump with joy, she saw all the cameras turn towards the background.</p><br/><p>There seemed to have been some kind of accident. Liu Jia had arrived in advance, so Qin Guan had tried to leave as soon as possible to leave the place to her. With a dangerous smile, he had stretched his arm out to Li Bingbing.</p><br/><p>Annoyed by Li, Liu had looked up and seen his charming smile.</p><br/><p>It had been like a spring breeze had suddenly blown and a pear had blossomed.</p><br/><p>In Liu's eyes, it had seemed like a scene from an old film. A man in black standing under a pear tree with white flowers as he smiled at her.</p><br/><p>Confused and stupefied, she had extended her hand, planning to take his arm. A woman in a red dress had ruined her dream though.</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing cast a glance at the strange girl and took Qin Guan's arm.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

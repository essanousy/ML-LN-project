The audience wasn\u2019t in the right mood to enjoy the show, but they didn't leave right away as they expected to be amused.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan got on the stage, there was a commotion all over the hall.</p><br/><p>A group of students who had gone shopping at the plaza, some of whom were from the same college as Qin Guan, had spotted their schoolmate.</p><br/><p>\"Are you familiar with that model?\"</p><br/><p>\"Which one? Let me see. Wow! Is that Qin Guan? The most handsome sophomore?\"</p><br/><p>\"Which one? Oh! Nice figure!\"</p><br/><p>Screams were heard. Led by the girls from Qin Guan's college, the group of students squeezed into the crowd curiously.</p><br/><p>The crowd of old men and women was attacked by the strong girls. Everyone was shouting and crying out.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, stop pushing me, you nasty girl!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, I want to watch! Don\u2019t push me away!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why there is a duck here?\"</p><br/><p>Yes, there was a staggering little duck looking at the stage.</p><br/><p>By that time, Qin Guan was at the center of the T stage. He struck a pose, caressing his chest and lifting his clothes, arousing screams from the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Look here!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone in the hall knew his name. Gold always shone, and Qin Guan had made a difference after the underwear show.</p><br/><p>The difference was like that between a student\u2019s painting and an original Picasso, the same as a green hands\u2019 handwriting and a calligrapher\u2019s work, just like an author\u2019s diary and a literary masterpiece...</p><br/><p>The boss backstage was smiling at the contrast in satisfaction. The customers had chosen to stay for Qin Guan and enjoy the fashion feast in the slightly cold plaza. Of course, they\u2019d have to put up with some ordinary models like the underwear models, but Qin Guan would perform again at the end.</p><br/><p>The girls had clustered around the little duck to get a good position by the stage. Actually, the little duck was Mou Xiaoliu. The other girls had gathered around her because she had been calling Qin Guan's name and had created a spare space with her strong body.</p><br/><p>When Mou took off the head piece of her duck costume, her senior sisters gave her the thumbs up. How powerful their college was! Qin Guan\u2019s fan club had been formed by accident.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan got on the stage at last, he saw Mou Xiaoliu. There were girls surrounding her, not only from his college, but also from other universities.</p><br/><p>With a black coat on his shoulders, Qin Guan waved at the duck casually, causing crazy screaming.</p><br/><p>Some people got the impression that MTS had spent too much on promotion. They chose to go around the discount area, where the products were high-end but reasonably priced.</p><br/><p>The boss couldn't close his mouth, even after Qin Guan had left. The tripled payment had been worthwhile and would be covered by the sales volume in only one hour.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Qin Guan expressed his appreciation to Mou Xiaoliu and the other girls. His fan club would extend to all universities within a five-kilometer radius from then on.</p><br/><p>The duck waved its wings and saw Qin Guan off reluctantly.</p><br/><p>In Sister Xue\u2019s car, Qin Guan rolled around in the backseat laughing. I\u2019m rich! What a good job! Triple payment!</p><br/><p>According to common practices, considering that Qin Guan had won a competition, his payment should have been at least 2,000 yuan. However, Qin Guan had no resources from New Silk Road, and Professor Li limited the scope of his job opportunities. Thanks to Qin Guan\u2019s title though, the boss had reluctantly paid him 1,500 yuan.</p><br/><p>Then the situation had changed, and he had been paid 4,500 yuan! Sister Xue exhaled in relief. I will not live on cold water and dry bread next month!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hadn\u2019t been aware of the hardships low-level models faced until he performed in his second outdoor show. Of course, he\u2019d had good luck until then. Qin Guan didn't feel strange about his status, but Sister Xue sensed that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>According to her experience, with a competition title and an affiliation with New Silk Road, Qin Guan should have been attracting attention from various advertising firms, magazines and representative agents.</p><br/><p>Even Ouyang Fen had plenty of offers, yet Qin Guan always lost jobs. He couldn't even get an interview. Ouyang Fen's proud nose was nearly poking her in the face.</p><br/><p>Before Sister Xue could discover the cruel truth, the day of Xie Feng\u2019s promotion show had come.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was positioned in the middle. His outfit was not the featured one, but a result of Xie's accidental inspiration before he\u2019d gone abroad.</p><br/><p>Xie Feng had been preparing for the overseas fashion show for more than eight months. As was the custom, his style was in accordance with the main style of the Milan Fashion Show.</p><br/><p>To promote the designing concept of a nation, the designers would first show their culture to the whole world.</p><br/><p>In 1999, China seemed strange and mysterious to overseas fashion circles. As a rising Chinese designer, what would Xie Feng show in his debut in the Milan Fashion Show, one of the four top international fashion shows?</p><br/><p>A combination of the Chinese culture, of course!</p><br/><p>Traditional reds, dense greens, the graceful scene south of the Changjiang River, and the wide landscape of North China were all blended in his conception.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had some work to do before the Spring Festival, but they could do anything they liked.</p><br/><p>However, he soon realized it was impossible for them to go somewhere together because of their different interests. His father liked a quiet life, while his mother preferred sports.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smartly retreated before their two different timetables. It was a confrontation between two immortals.</p><br/><p>He also had to attend the annual New Silk Road gala in formal attire. It was a bonus for models. If one\u2019s status was upgraded, there were many sponsors for outfits of their choice.</p><br/><p>To express their appreciation for the contribution of the staff to the company, New Silk Road would hold a gala before the Spring Festival.</p><br/><p>All the office staff, models, brand representatives, media directors and other contributors were invited to the feast.</p><br/><p>Although Qin Guan was an affiliated model, he had brought great brand influence and profits to the company with his outstanding performance, so he had been invited.</p><br/><p>The gala was held in a chateau close to the airport road, which had been a creative idea. If not for the desolate winter, it would have been even more beautiful there.</p><br/><p>The drinks were free, which was considered a plus by most people.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was quite relaxed, and the emcee and performers were all company staff. Which part did they like best?</p><br/><p>The lottery and the boss\u2019s performance, of course. At least there was a big buffet.</p><br/><p>As a money-grubber, Qin Guan focused on the rewards of the annual gala. When the happy performance ended, the emcee announced the prize winners.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was surprised to hear his own name. It was great luck for an affiliated model, who was basically a nobody to all the staff.</p><br/><p>\"The prize winner for Best Newcomer is Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan mounted the stage leisurely, only to realize that the emcee was Ouyang Fen. Qin Guan hadn\u2019t recognized him under that heavy powder.</p><br/><p>Ouyang watched Qin Guan with an evil intention. He handed him his bonus before telling the audience, \"We\u2019d like to thank Qin Guan for his contribution to our company. Under normal circumstances, the prize winner would give a formulaic speech, but we have a surprise for you all. We didn't inform the winners in advance, so they did not come prepared. Our boss wanted to give them the greatest surprise.\"</p><br/><p>\"The annual newcomer winner is the best among all the models who started working during the same period, without exception. Look at the delicious boy next to me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Meanwhile, they are also performance pacesetters with exceptional professional ability. Those models can adjust their mentality to any emergency in order to do their job.\"</p><br/><p>\"Our surprise for you today is an impromptu performance from our winner. He will dance to background music. If you like his dance, you can buy flowers for him, like people did during the election of the best lorette in ancient times. Of course, I\u2019m not implying that our winner is a whore.\"</p><br/><p>The audience applauded happily.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen waved to Miss Etiquette, who carried the flower baskets to the stage. There were fresh flowers blooming in them. One cost ten yuan. There was also a small money box nearby.</p><br/><p>The attendants seemed excited.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finally realized he was being used. No one had informed him of this, including his agent, who seemed like the happiest person under the stage.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue looked excited. It was a bonus after all. There would be hundreds of flowers in the baskets. If Qin Guan did well on the stage, they would get more money!</p><br/><p>Ouyang asked Qin Guan, \"Are you ready? We expect a surprise from our winner!\"</p><br/><p>The DJ pressed a button and music started playing.</p><br/><p>\"The eighth exercise has begun!\" [1]</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nearly fell down on the stage. Were they kidding? The audience was laughing.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha! It sure deserves to be called New Silk Road. That\u2019s so creative! It\u2019s better than singing or dancing!\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder if the winner can do exercises well. Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no choice but to do exercises to the music. Fortunately, he hadn't forgotten the basic movements. His pants were tight on his legs, which made him look sexy to the ladies.</p><br/><p>He pulled a red silk scarf from Ouyang's pocket and replaced it with his tie.</p><br/><p>Then he saluted the audience like a Young Pioneer. The girls cried out under the stage. Several of them bought bouquets and threw them towards the stage.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue glanced at the flowers and counted in her mind. The moneymaking begins!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the music changed to the Yangge of Northeastern China. Ouch! I twisted my waist!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked to his right and saw Ouyang Fen smiling at him. Qin Guan was ready to risk everything. He took off the red scarf and danced, using it as a handkerchief.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha...\"</p><br/><p>The audience was seething. Qin Guan tried to make faces and look at the audience. Some people spit out the wine in their mouths.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue felt awkward. Teacher Rong's training seems effective. He sure is a good actor now.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] The song was popular among Chinese students in the 1990s.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

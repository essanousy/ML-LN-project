Why are you up so early?\" Wearing only a pair of shorts, Qin Guan came out of his room, rubbing his eyes. \"There\u2019s so much noise! Is something going on?\"</p><br/><p>The guys were shocked by his presence. They hadn\u2019t gone to the wrong dormitory after all. The two of them were staying together.</p><br/><p> \"Give me a good morning kiss...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan kissed Cong Nianwei on the forehead before glancing at the people outside the door.</p><br/><p>\"What happened? Who are they?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. As soon as I opened the door, they rushed over. Then\u2026 Look...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan bent down to check the trap and picked the dirty cloth up before letting it go disdainfully.</p><br/><p>Then he pulled Cong Nianwei into the room.</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s just freshmen mischief. What shall we have for breakfast?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan closed the door, breaking the hearts of the three guys. Why do pretty flowers always belong to somebody else? Why do pigs always get the cabbages? We won't give up. No matter the goalkeeper, a good player can always score.</p><br/><p>Exchanging meaningful glances with each other, they decided that Qin Guan was their No.1 enemy. They followed Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei to the canteen.</p><br/><p> \"Is there something wrong with my eyes? Is that guy...\"</p><br/><p>\"You are right. I can see him!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone in the canteen was attracted by the boy who had entered the room.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a white T-shirt with a large mysterious character printed on it. His black hair looked golden under the sunshine. He looked warm and beautiful as he walked into the canteen surrounded by a group of people. His smile made everyone feel warm.</p><br/><p>\"Is he her f*cking boyfriend? He's quite different from the guy we just saw.\"</p><br/><p>\"He had just gotten out of bed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Will our plan work? We are obviously no competition for him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, just ask the people around him. Everyone has their shortcomings.\"</p><br/><p>However, they didn't get a general idea about Qin Guan's background until the visitors from Columbia entered the meeting room. Suddenly, they saw a group of people walking on campus in a formidable array.</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck! Are they from Harvard?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Ring the alarm!\"</p><br/><p>\"They are meeting the guys from Columbia!\"</p><br/><p>After spending a happy day together, the Harvard students had been reluctant to say goodbye to the Columbia students, so they had followed them to MIT.</p><br/><p>Of course, they could also take advantage of this chance to bully MIT in the process. They were fond of bullying those bookworms during sports events.</p><br/><p> Harvard also wanted to host the guests from Columbia.</p><br/><p>\"What are they going to do?\"</p><br/><p>\"Those shameless guys! They are playing football on our lawn!\"</p><br/><p>\"Those bullies!\"</p><br/><p>\"Even Columbia, who has the worst team in the Ivy League, is better than us!\"</p><br/><p> As masters of mischief though, they thought of a plan fast.</p><br/><p>\"Call more people\u2026 Here, like this...\"</p><br/><p>\"Fetch that thing we made last time...\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! That\u2019s so naughty\u2026 I like it!\"</p><br/><p>They all got to work while Harvard and Columbia played football.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Watt. Is the audience increasing?\"</p><br/><p>\"They might be attracted by our charm!\"</p><br/><p>Watt showed off his muscles, facing the spectator stands. As the audience screamed, he threw the ball out of the court.</p><br/><p>\"Here you go!\"</p><br/><p> A boy from MIT picked the ball up and handed it back to Watt in admiration.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks. I\u2019ll give you an autograph later.\" Watt took the ball and walked back to the center of the court happily.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, be careful!\"</p><br/><p>He threw the ball at full force. Suddenly, the ball exploded in the air.</p><br/><p>As the wind dispersed the smoke, everyone saw Watt standing there, ashes covering his face. His hair looked smoky. The remains of the ball were lying by his feet. Suddenly, a small balloon rose from the broken ball, with a colorful banner that said \"Long Live MIT!\"</p><br/><p> \"Ha ha! Wonderful! Take pictures!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

During that time, he had witnessed Qin Guan's struggle in America and China with envy. He wished that Cong Nianwei would break up with him because of this rumoured affair.</p><br/><p>However, he had discovered that it was only a display of their romance! There was nothing to get excited about.</p><br/><p>Wait... What if his fans turn against Cong Nianwei? She is the girlfriend of a beloved actor after all. That's not a comfortable throne for her to sit on. What will the calm girl do if the fans get angry with her? Could this be a chance for her to break up with him? It's hard for a shy architect to bear the malevolence of the entire entertainment circle...</p><br/><p>Excited, Chi Hailin sent everyone the same message.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, she is Qin Guan's girlfriend. She graduated from the Architecture Department of Tsinghua University in 2002. Her name is Cong Nianwei. That's her!\"</p><br/><p>That information was more than enough for them. Chi Hailin sat and waited to see what would happen next. Everyone got excited upon reading the message. We found out the truth!</p><br/><p>The striking news made all users return to the Haijiao Forum, only to find it silent. Everyone had gotten distracted by other posts.</p><br/><p>What had happened? They read through the comments quickly and saw that an official announcement had been released.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's blog was as noisy as a bazaar, as Qin Guan's fans and several idlers gathered to read the latest news.</p><br/><p>A large, clear photo of the lovers was on the first page of the blog. The young couple was leaning close to each other with their heads touching. There was a sweet smile on both their faces.</p><br/><p>Under the photo was the caption: My girlfriend will return to the capital after staying with the crew. I'm so reluctant to watch her leave...</p><br/><p>This was the first time Qin Guan was sharing his private life with the public. Everyone turned their eyes to a short essay written by Qin Guan, titled \"Common Witness\".</p><br/><p>\"Cong Nianwei is my girlfriend and childhood sweetheart. I fell in love with her when we were both 15 years old.</p><br/><p>\"After four years of pursuing her, my dream finally came true. We are always together now, no matter where we go.\" There was also a photo of them at the airport from the day they were leaving for America. They looked so much younger in it.</p><br/><p>\"You have infinite power over me.\" Beneath was a photo of Qin Guan's first job in New York.</p><br/><p>\"We studied together, succeeded together and returned to China together. Never leave or forsake.\" A bunch of photos from their gallery and QC firm followed.</p><br/><p>\"I finally have your promise. Will you marry me the day my shelf is filled with awards?\" Then came a photo of all the awards Qin Guan had won during the past few years.</p><br/><p>\"Please give us your blessing!\"</p><br/><p>His warm, romantic words touched the readers' hearts.</p><br/><p>Soon, Qin Guan's fans accepted his girlfriend. They had known this ever since they had fallen in love with him after all. They were all reasonable girls. They wouldn't commit suicide because their idol had a girlfriend.</p><br/><p>That was the definition of a real fan. Calm love was better than obsessive love.</p><br/><p>The news took over the internet. Soon, everyone started sending their blessings to the lovers, including Cong Nianwei's girlfriends, Qin Guan's naughty friends and their colleagues.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were also some people who didn't like those news. Chi Hailin was one of them.</p><br/><p>After his revealing post, he had waited silently for the storm to pass. After a long silence, he had seen the news on Qin Guan's blog and choked before the photos. Can I spit out blood to ease my annoyance?</p><br/><p>He knew he was wrong thanks to the online feedback, as well as the abundant blessings people bestowed upon Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

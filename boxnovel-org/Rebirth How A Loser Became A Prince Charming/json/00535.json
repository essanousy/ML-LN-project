Show me your muscles!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did as he was asked.</p><br/><p>\"Good! Do you have a moustache?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Qu shook their heads in unison. Qin Guan was still in his twenties, so he would not get a beard until several years later.</p><br/><p>Nichols didn\u2019t let Qin Guan go though. \"Did you learn anything from powerful, confident high-profile actors?\" he asked suddenly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was stunned at first, but he gave the right response quickly. \"Do you mean something like this?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up slowly, taking off a pair of imaginary gloves. His movements were elegant and arrogant, like those of experienced actors. Anyone around him would be careful instinctively.</p><br/><p>\"No, you have to look even more brutal and barbaric... Like a proud man with a high social status who always knows what he needs...\"</p><br/><p>Before his voice could fade away, Qin Guan had already changed. His expression became fierce and aggressive with pride. Although he was smiling kindly, anyone would be able to feel his inner power. He was someone on top of the social pyramid.</p><br/><p>Staring at Nichols, he said, \"I think an audition would be unnecessary. The part is mine!\"</p><br/><p>That was unparalleled boldness!</p><br/><p>Qu felt scared, but Nichols burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, young man. You are quite right. It will be my honor to have you act in the film.\"</p><br/><p>The child-like director had decided to cooperate with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The two of them shook hands warmly. Before they left, Nichols stopped Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"I almost forgot! The theatrical version of \u2018Closer\u2019 has been on Broadway for some time. You can watch it when you return to New York. It might enlighten you.\"</p><br/><p>That explained why the German director was so successful and kind with actors.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had misunderstood the old man. Nichols was famous in the film circle for his honesty.</p><br/><p>He relied on acting skills instead of personal fame. Many stars had burst into tears during filming because of him. If one met his demands though, then nothing else mattered.</p><br/><p>He asked Qin Guan to watch the play to get familiar with the plot in advance. He wanted to avoid making another actor burst into tears in the near future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had spent too much time in Los Angeles. It was time to return to New York, where Cong Nianwei and Xue Wanyi were waiting for him.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had reached an agreement with IMG and ELITE. They were just waiting for the leading actor to make the final decision.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was sitting calmly in the meeting room of the IMG headquarters. Anyone who knew her would notice her nervousness by observing her moving thumbs.</p><br/><p>The people sitting opposite her were the talented clients of the two agencies and the principal in charge of the model promotion for the top four fashion weeks.</p><br/><p>They were the best at discovering models and estimating their potential and value.</p><br/><p>The two parties remained silent until an assistant led Qin Guan in. Qu had completed her task successfully. Now she could return to VOGUE to meet with Qin Guan's fan club and talk about the blog.</p><br/><p>\"Nice to meet you! I\u2019m Qin Guan,\" Qin Guan said with a smile, surprising everyone.</p><br/><p>The Asian woman had to be a monster. She had tempted them into signing an unfair agreement with some cooperative terms and letting the top model go easily!</p><br/><p>They realized they had been cheated. That so-called exchange with a mysterious country had been a trap. They would not be making the best of two worlds. They would be suffering a big loss!</p><br/><p>The principal panted angrily as he noticed Sister Xue's proud smile.</p><br/><p>If he had been Qin Guan\u2019s agent, he would have become famous all over the world in three months, not taking on the occasional job like he was now!</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for this opportunity. I\u2019m honored. I also want to thank Ms. Xue Wanyi, my agent, who let me enjoy life after studying and working hard for so long...\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned by his words. Qin Guan continued in a kind voice, \"I am only able to be a part-time model because Sister Xue tolerates my requirements. There is a set system in the industry, and this job requires discipline and punctuality.\"</p><br/><p>\"As the two top companies in America, both IMG and ELITE are concerned about that.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan glanced at everyone around him. They were nodding at his words.</p><br/><p>\"There is a Chinese saying about strict order enforcement and prohibitions. The larger a company is, the stricter its principal will be.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

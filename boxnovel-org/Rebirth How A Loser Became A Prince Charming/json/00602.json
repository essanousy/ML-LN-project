The models calmed down and got to work orderly.</p><br/><p> He handed his suit to the assistant with a strict expression. Nothing could affect him. He was always concentrated on his job.</p><br/><p>The male models were looking at him with mixed emotions. He was close to them, but they felt as if he was far away.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>His voice sounded like pearls falling on a jade plate. He looked at them with a polite smile.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing, just take a look\u2026\" they answered together, beckoning at him. Their anger dispersed like smoke.</p><br/><p>\"Let me know if I can help. We'll be working together at the end of the show after all...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed to Sister Xue with a friendly smile. \"She will be here, even if I'm not.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue forced a smile. Silly boy! Just do your own work, okay?</p><br/><p>During the past few years, Sister Xue had been following Qin Guan all over the world. She had forgotten that this was a top show and those troublemakers were all talented models that she used to look up to.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went into an empty fitting room as Sister Xue talked and exchanged cards with other agents. Just when everyone thought that the show would come to a quiet end though, something unexpected happened.</p><br/><p>The closing show would take place in the reverse order of the opening show, so Qin Guan could chat with his female partner as he waited for his turn. The model was a naughty French girl with black hair and freckles. She was a model for Valentino.</p><br/><p>Her name was Rubi, which sounded as pretty and soft as a fawn. Qin Guan liked the girl, who was six years younger than him.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Rubi!\"</p><br/><p>\"We are coming!\" Rubi parted ways with Qin Guan at the exit.</p><br/><p>Music started playing. As they walked on the long runway, one of them was on the left and the other was on the right. The small doors opened and they walked to the small square.</p><br/><p>The square was used for publicity events during the Fashion Week. On the first day of the Fashion Week, the opening ceremony was held there. The models before them were walking back to the backstage area under the watchful eye of the media and the audience.</p><br/><p>As the best of the best, Qin Guan and Rubi had to appear on the square.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" Screams rose one after the other like a wave as the reporters tried to find the best spot to take pictures.</p><br/><p>There was a security guard standing every couple of meters. They all seemed nervous as the closing show progressed.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the crowd near Rubi grew agitated. A man in a windcoat jumped over the fence and rushed up to the T stage. The man, who looked like a lunatic, unfastened the belt around his waist and threw it in the air. He was only wearing a pair of shorts under his coat!</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan was standing at the front of the stage with Rubi. The man was getting closer to them.</p><br/><p>Help! A crackpot!</p><br/><p>Roaring, the man climbed up on the stage like a monkey.</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked. In a moment, the gorgeous show had turned into a farce. Time paused as the whole audience focused on the naked man.</p><br/><p>The man was running with his arms open, as if he was about to hug his sweetheart.</p><br/><p>\"Darling, I'm coming! I've loved you since the first time I saw you...\"</p><br/><p>\"Help!\" Rubi cried out. The man was really close to them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stopped performing and rushed over to the crazy man. When he was close enough, he used his strength.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

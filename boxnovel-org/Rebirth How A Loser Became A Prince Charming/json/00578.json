Matta couldn't have them both.</p><br/><p>Matta walked to the workbench disappointedly, her knees hurting from her fall. If she hadn't reacted quickly, Qin Guan's knee would have hit her on her nose. The guy had no compassion for women!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she paused in the aisle. Lilian nearly ran into her back.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? Watch your step!\" Lilian said in discontent.</p><br/><p>\"Lilian, can you help me?\"</p><br/><p>\"With what?\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall we exchange passengers? You take Qin Guan, and I'll serve Chris. Is that okay?\"</p><br/><p>Lilian was wondering why she had changed her mind.</p><br/><p>\"As you saw, Lilian, I just fell down. It would be awkward for me to serve for Mr. Qin again. Please take my place!\"</p><br/><p>Lilian felt sympathy for Matta. \"Fine. Be more careful next time!\"</p><br/><p>Matta let out a long sigh of relief. It's unnecessary to waste time on stubborn people. There will probably be a complaint anyway. I have to think of another plan.</p><br/><p>Chris crossed his legs excitedly in the first-class cabin. Boy, I've got you now!</p><br/><p>\"Will you accept my offer this time?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a sip of champagne and pretended not to understand. \"What offer? I think my agent has already rejected it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop acting like an idiot. As far as I know, no film company in Los Angeles is going to be working with you for the next few months, and your jobs at the Milan and New York Fashion Weeks will be a piece of cake for you. Just tell me! Will you be my model during my Las Vegas tour?\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gave him a resolute answer. Chris was considered a madman in the magician circle. He would never consider his proposal, but if he got an offer from David Copperfield, he might accept it if his schedule allowed it.</p><br/><p> This guy though... One could judge him just by his costume. His hair was long and colorful, and thick bangs covered one of his eyes. The other one looked like the eye of a panda. He was wearing a black sweater filled with skulls and poppies, even though it was summer</p><br/><p>He had tied a pair of handcuffs around his neck like a necklace, and his leather pants and boots looked like a Gestapo uniform.</p><br/><p>He was completely crazy. His performance was so full of blood and gore that Qu Xuemei and Sister Xue would never accept an offer from him.</p><br/><p>Chris was not dejected by Qin Guan's rejection though. He took off his boots and stretched his feet out towards him.</p><br/><p>They smelled like fermented bean curd, feces and men's locker room... Qin Guan tried to get away from him, but Chris laughed proudly.</p><br/><p>\"It doesn't matter. I will announce the news before the reporters at the JFK.\"</p><br/><p>\"Come here, everyone! This is the Best Actor Award winner, Qin Guan! A stewardess just gave him a blowjob!\"</p><br/><p>\"If they ask me for proof, I'll swear to God...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless. Chris was a real scoundrel.</p><br/><p>\"I thought Americans were faithful to God. Does He know that you are using Him like this?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm Greek, you know. I believe in Zeus.\"</p><br/><p>Liar... Qin Guan sighed.</p><br/><p>\"I have to discuss it with my agent. I have several arrangements during the next six months.\"</p><br/><p>\"So I have your word? Thanks, bro!\"</p><br/><p>Hey, watch what you say. I said I would discuss it, I did not promise anything!</p><br/><p>Chris was happy with the outcome though. He grinned, revealing his white teeth. Suddenly, the captain spoke through the speaker, reminding everyone that the plane was about to take off.</p><br/><p>A flight attendant handed Qin Guan and Chris a pair of earplugs.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for flying with United Airlines...\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, I'm scared! I'm afraid of flying!\" Chris tried to hold on to Qin Guan's hand.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck off! You have hung from a skyscraper in New York for three days!\"</p><br/><p>\"Just kidding...\"</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could sneer at Chris, the plane had risen to the stratosphere. It was an easy time for both the plane and the passengers. Matta and Lilian began serving dinner in the first-class cabin using a small wagon.</p><br/><p>The champagne was clear and smooth. Lilian filled Qin Guan's cup with an aperitif. The champagne cost 500 dollars, but the airline was generous with its first-class passengers.</p><br/><p>Matta placed the knives and forks on the white linen and served them along with the appetizer. There were plenty of choices, although they were in small amounts. The white bream fillets were transparent and the boiled broccoli stimulated everyone's appetite.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Good Boys!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lan_ Editor: Efydatia</p><br/><p>All the directors of the sixth generation shared the same ideas. They worked both for their dreams and fame.</p><br/><p>Even though the SARFT set strict prohibitions, directors bet all they had on independent films, thus expressing their enthusiasm for underground movies. Ang Lee won the Golden Lion again, which showed the judges' love for Chinese directors.</p><br/><p>The awards, which focused on artistic films, would keep welcoming Chinese films in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had a bright future ahead of him.</p><br/><p>However, this Grand Slam made him turn over in his bed, unable to fall asleep. He eventually picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>The phone happened to ring at exactly that moment. According to the caller ID, it was a call from Cong Nianwei, the person who understood him the best in the world.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, darling. Why are you calling me this late?\"</p><br/><p>\"I knew that you wouldn't be able to fall asleep. If I didn't call you, you'd just call me later.\"</p><br/><p>\"You know me so well. Did you hear that I won another acting award?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I watched the live broadcast. I heard your speech.\"</p><br/><p>\"I was just trying to be funny. Don't think too much about it. Have I kept my promise?\"</p><br/><p>\"If you mean your promise to put the biggest awards in the world on that shelf, then yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Does this mean that we can have a grand wedding ceremony now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Grand?\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you think of the ceremony the Prince of the UK threw?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's funny, but the media will criticize you for it.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan almost choked. He was left speechless.</p><br/><p>These days, rich people have to be careful with their behavior. This is money I earned through hard personal work. I should have the right to spend it however I please. The public's hate for the rich is a serious issue in China.</p><br/><p>People couldn't find real happiness by increasing their income after all. A contented mind was a perpetual feast.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hung up feeling resentful. Cong Nianwei refused to consider having a wedding ceremony before the Olympic stadium was finished. Thus, Qin Guan had enough time to build their home.</p><br/><p>Maybe I should earn some money for our wedding ceremony first.</p><br/><p>His work overseas had come to an end, so Qin Guan decided to take advantage of the events in Venice and return to China.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, he called the director of \"Cheers! Good Boys! 2007\" and spoke to him on the phone about a program on Dragon Television. Qin Guan was just in time for the last seat on the judge panel. The auditions, which had lasted four months, had finally come to an end. All the talented individuals would gather in Shanghai for the final. After some general training, they would fight for a place among the top 10.</p><br/><p>This award was the most valuable one in China. It even beat \"Super Boy\" when it came to audience ratings. Dragon and Hunan, who were big rivals, scheduled the two programs in similar time slots in an effort to capture the attention of the younger audience.</p><br/><p>Girls around the nation were divided in two camps that supported different idols from the two TV shows. Dragon Television, which was smart and bold, took a final chance on the talent show in 2007. The SARFT would issue regulations and adjustments to guide the young viewers' opinion later. In 2008, Chinese talent shows would become more sensible.</p><br/><p>As a result, in an era when everyone needed an idol, this particular show enjoyed wonderful audience ratings.</p><br/><p>When the producers saw Qin Guan, they went mad with joy. They knew that he was the God of Fortune. The boss of J Clothing had also weeded out all the competitors and become the final sponsor of the show.</p><br/><p>The man was confident about the show because of Qin Guan, who had told him that he would be participating as a guest judge. The two of them were long-term partners, so the boss made a decision without hesitation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Anyone who looked at it felt happy.</p><br/><p>Sister Li took the photo and taped it on the certificate. Then the official seals of the legal registration were stamped on the paper. She pushed the two certificates towards Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei and pointed to the bigger room across the hallway.</p><br/><p>This was a new step of the process that aimed to add a sense of sacredness to the ceremony and make couples understand the importance of marriage.</p><br/><p>All the couples took their oaths before the national flag and the country's emblem. It was a small wedding ceremony held by the government that added some warmth to the formal procedure.</p><br/><p>The couple stood in front of the background and read the words along with the master of the ceremony.</p><br/><p>If this had been a fantasy novel, the words would have been a curse. However, the young couple only felt the sweetness of their new reality.</p><br/><p>When their last words faded away, the audience started clapping.</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you all!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stuffed the certificates carefully into his backpack and took something else out.</p><br/><p>It was cigarettes and candy for the staff. This was his way of showing his gratitude.</p><br/><p>\"Have some candy!\"</p><br/><p>The room was full of joy. Qin Guan felt like a disposable employee who had finally gotten a permanent job.</p><br/><p>\"Shall we take a group photo, Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"We won't let the news leak. When will you make an official announcement?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't want to hide this from my fans. I'll tell everybody after New Year's. It's not like it's a bad thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Great!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone ran over and clustered around them. The photographer walked over with the camera.</p><br/><p>\"Three, two, one\u2026 Cheese!\"</p><br/><p>This photo would become the highlight of their collections.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei went out of the room happily. The noisy hall suddenly became silent. All the crying and smiling couples had fixed their eyes on them. They were blocked half-way through the room.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know. Why are you whispering?\"</p><br/><p>\"It says 'Talking Loudly Is Prohibited' on the wall!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone started talking quietly. As Qin Guan approached the exit, a brave man suddenly shouted, \"Qin Guan! Are you here for a marriage registration?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around with a grin. His voice sounded happy and crisp. He looked like the happiest guy in the world.</p><br/><p>Everyone wanted to give him their best wishes.</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook everyone's hands in salute. Then he left as soon as possible with his beloved wife.</p><br/><p>From that moment on, he would be a married man with a burden on his shoulders. From that moment on, his lover would be his family.</p><br/><p>We will grow old together.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

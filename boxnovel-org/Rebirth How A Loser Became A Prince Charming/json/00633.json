This house is pretty good. Just listen to me! Your bank is right across the street. I could bring you dinner at night. Take-away is crap. I don't care if it's made by the cook at your cafeteria.\"</p><br/><p>The plump woman with the flowery scarf noticed Qin Guan and heard him greet her husband.</p><br/><p>\"You know Lao Liu? That boy is so handsome! Did you just graduate from college?\"</p><br/><p>The passionate woman saw Cong Nianwei, who was holding hands with Qin Guan, and smiled meaningfully. \"A young couple looking for a matrimonial house! You should take a good look around!\"</p><br/><p>Director Liu was scared of Qin Guan. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei looked at the man with a knowing smile. It seems like this woman is his wife. Before Qin Guan could have a word with the woman, Liu grabbed his arm.</p><br/><p>The short man possessed the power of a bear.</p><br/><p>\"He is a client of mine... Come on, let's take a look around together!\"</p><br/><p>He pulled Qin Guan through the emergency exit and into the stairway.</p><br/><p>Crack! The door was closed as the light was turned on.</p><br/><p>Liu and Qin Guan gazed at each other. Suddenly, Liu strengthened his chest. \"Is your name Qin Guan? Please spare me! Don't tell my wife about Mou. She would start asking questions. Just tell her that you are my client or my subordinate\u2026 Supervisor would also be okay...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the man calmly with both hands in his pockets.</p><br/><p>A great man always knew when to surrender and when to resist. Liu ground his teeth as he kept begging Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"People always take advantage of their subordinates, young man. Besides, I didn't make any mistakes.\"</p><br/><p>Liu looked up and saw Qin Guan's apathetic expression.</p><br/><p>\"I'm so poor!\" Liu buried his face in his hands. \"I'm a middle-aged man with parents, in-laws and kids to take care of... I worked hard for many years in order to become a director. My decadent thoughts disappeared as soon as they formed...\"</p><br/><p>He started crying as dramatically as a woman.</p><br/><p>\"That's enough!\" Qin Guan broke in helplessly. \"No one wants to rat you out to your wife!\"</p><br/><p>\"Then why are you looking at me so strictly?\"</p><br/><p>\"That was my reaction to your terrible acting skills.\"</p><br/><p>Liu took out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead. \"Of course. How could I compare to an award-winning actor?\"</p><br/><p>\"You know who I am?\"</p><br/><p>\"I saw you in a cosmetics advertisement. I didn't know you were so successful abroad.\"</p><br/><p>Are you trying to flatter me?</p><br/><p>Liu had revealed his true colors. Qin Guan couldn't help but let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\"Director Liu?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your handkerchief is clean. Does your wife wash it for you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. How do you know that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Tough men like us don't carry around handkerchiefs. It must have been prepared by a woman. Besides, your wife must get along quite well.\"</p><br/><p>\"How do you know that?\" Director Liu looked confused.</p><br/><p>\"People use tissues these days. Very few people insist on the old habit, even though it saves money and protects the environment.\"</p><br/><p>Liu stuffed his handkerchief into his pocket silently. Then he looked up.</p><br/><p>\"Although you are a nice young man, I have to point out that you are quite talented at sneering at people. What do you mean by 'tough men like us'? Look at your face. You are trying to bully me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at him. \"Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>They opened the door only to find out that their families had exchanged houses.</p><br/><p>\"Do you like it? If there is something you find unsatisfactory, don't worry. Our company will inform you as soon as we develop some new real estate.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's mother shook her head. \"No, just bring the contract.\" She had decided to buy it.</p><br/><p>The manager was very happy to hear that.</p><br/><p>\"Full payment or mortgage?\"</p><br/><p>\"Full payment!\"</p><br/><p>The manager paused for a second. Then she headed to the cashier. I misjudged them.</p><br/><p>The POS beeped, making the favorite sound of salesmen everywhere as the receipt rolled out slowly from the machine. It was very convenient to get paid right away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

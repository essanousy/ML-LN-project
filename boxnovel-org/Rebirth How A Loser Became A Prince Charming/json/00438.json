Soon, Qin Guan was sitting exhausted in his chair. He suddenly recalled the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\". The protagonist had originally been a banker, with almost the same calculating abilities as Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Chinese men and women were standing in line in front of their desks. According to a traditional Chinese saying, when people from the same town met, they cried. Qin Guan's team was really familiar with them.</p><br/><p>Both Chinese people from Chinatown and other places around Manhattan had come over. In China, all doors opened in courtesy, while in America business was business. As a result, these people had the chance to express their gratitude.</p><br/><p>\"You are really capable, young man. Check this form for me, please. And the previous payrolls. This is quite a trouble for me! In China, the government just tells me the amount of taxes I have to pay...\"</p><br/><p>An old woman handed him a payroll issued by the New York Stock Exchange. She got paid a considerable amount of money for working as a public area janitor on Wall Street.</p><br/><p>Next to the payrolls was a bundle of spring onions and a bag of eggs. It seemed like she had been to the supermarket just before coming to the restaurant.</p><br/><p>\"Oh! Thanks, but...\"</p><br/><p>\"Take it. You are so handsome, but you are too thin. My boy is stronger than you. He is about 100 kilos...\"</p><br/><p>I think you'd be a good feeder... It was hard to turn down that kind offer. In half an hour, a bunch of presents were piled by his feet.</p><br/><p>There were pickled cucumbers from a Chinese chef working for a Michelin-starred restaurant, a small toolbox brought by a fireman from Fifth Avenue and some Chinese drugs that aided sexual function... Thanks a lot!</p><br/><p>Before that day, Qin Guan had had no idea about the Chinese immigrants\u2019 infiltration capacity in New York. They had talented people in all industries, but were lacking the power to unite.</p><br/><p>Night fell and the crowd dispersed. There were smiles on everyone\u2019s faces. Those simple people always forgot to fight for their rights.</p><br/><p>\"Boss Qin, business is flourishing! Your treat, okay?\" Xu looked up from a pile of paperwork, holding a toothpick in his mouth. His hair was like a bird\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>The chatting girls focused on their boss, who was always charming. He grinned and took a card out of his pocket.</p><br/><p>\"I have a golden card from your restaurant. You\u2019ll be paying...\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh! Don't forget to find two sheets for me. I got so many practical gifts. I love Chinese people. Americans come to my house for dinner with only a flower!\"</p><br/><p>The girls burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, I want the puff package!\"</p><br/><p>\"The home-made chilli sauce also seems delicious!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless. They are really my staff! They are all foodies! </p><br/><p>Soon, all the presents were taken away. People always had some bad friends in their lives. Qin Guan was crying internally as he heard their happy laughter and cheerful voices.</p><br/><p>He was still crying when he got to the VOGUE headquarters. If he had a doll, a needle and a thread, he would have stitched Qu's birthday on a doll [1].</p><br/><p>He had a really tight schedule. All his work in the future would be arranged by Qu Xuemei.</p><br/><p>IWC watches, Tiffany jewellery, the Armani perfume, haute couture\u2026 Other small products made by famous brands... Tens of notices in total! There was a summary at the end of the form. His total income was an impressive 20 million dollars!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan held his breath when he saw the amount.</p><br/><p>\"You were also chosen as the exclusive model of VOGUE for the next three seasons. Congratulations! You beat Chad by 40%. Sign these!\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Qu dropped a pile of paperwork on her desk. It was as thick as a dictionary.</p><br/><p>\"There\u2019s no rush.\" She was about to walk out of the office, but when she reached the door, she suddenly remembered something.</p><br/><p>\"To avoid overexposure to the public, Sister Xue has asked that you turn down indie films. I\u2019ll make the decision for you. After signing those papers, you will go to an audition for a TV series.\"</p><br/><p>\"They are working with flexible methods and high efficiency. I think it will fit your schedule.\"</p><br/><p>That schedule will sabotage the way I pursue art.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt sad, but he would still get the chance to act in a TV series, which was pretty good. In America, films and TV were two entirely different circles. Only popular actors could balance between them.</p><br/><p>His hand was sore from signing. Finally, he found the copy of a script at the bottom of all the paperwork. It was titled \"Sex and the City- Season Six\". He would be auditioning for a guest part in the first episode. The requirements were simpe. They were looking for a tall, handsome, sexy man.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. He knew Qu\u2019s standards. He would be playing himself. It would be easy for him. The series were focusing on the lives of four women living in New York. Love and sex were always a popular topic.</p><br/><p>[1] To secretly curse Qu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

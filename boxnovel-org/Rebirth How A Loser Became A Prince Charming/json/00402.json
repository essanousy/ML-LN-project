His guide had been the only one who had known about his identity. He could get rid of his secret identity now.</p><br/><p> Oh, no. There was one more person. The woman who\u2019d shared a happy memory with him and saved him from the Soviet State Security Committee. She had called him the night before his wedding ceremony, when he was about to marry his girlfriend, who was played by Drew Barrymore.</p><br/><p> It was night in the single apartment. Cameras were placed in the corners and in the corridor. The director was sitting behind one of them, watching the splendid scene.</p><br/><p> Julia was waiting for Qin Guan at home, wearing a sexy silk nightgown. They were going to talk about the deaths of their comrades.</p><br/><p> Green porcelain cups were set on a black tray, filled with coffee she had made herself. The milk pot was surrounded by the cups.</p><br/><p> Julia poured milk gently into two cups.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was wearing a fashionable flowery shirt of the 1980s. The buttons on his chest were unfastened, revealing his naked skin.</p><br/><p> Looking happily at the warm coffee, he began his farewell speech.</p><br/><p> This was their last meeting after all. Qin Guan had decided to be loyal to his wife, so he had to say goodbye to his lover, no matter how much it hurt.</p><br/><p> \"This is good coffee. I\u2019d like to be a writer in the future. i want to write a masterpiece everyone will quote. I don't want to live an assassin\u2019s life anymore. I live in fear all the time. This life is not respectable.\"</p><br/><p> Julia seemed reluctant to end their affair. Rubbing her slender fingers, she said, \"I miss you, Chuck. I always bury my emotions. Boston is a beautiful city. Maybe I could start a new life there.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled, but remained silent. His smile looked splendid and comfortable. Even the stars in the sky couldn't outshine his charm.</p><br/><p> He pointed outside the window, showing Julia the city at night. Julia turned around and pointed to the photos along the corridor. His image was there, the symbol of her love.</p><br/><p> They picked up their cups and toasted gently, looking at each other.</p><br/><p> \"To life... Cheers...\"</p><br/><p> The coffee was smooth as silk, moving down their throats and filling their stomachs.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stood up. He was ready to leave, but suddenly he fell down to the floor. \"What's happening?\"</p><br/><p> He was rolling around on the floor, completely out of breath. Julia put down her cup leisurely and leaned slowly towards the soft bed. She looked like a guide to Hell.</p><br/><p> \"Wow! You look terrible. You should take a look at William. I took a perfect photo of him.\"</p><br/><p> William had been a member of the secret service team.</p><br/><p> \"Keeler was much easier.\" She stood up and walked over to Qin Guan. \"He would have travelled through half of the Earth to spend a night with me.\"</p><br/><p> Keeler had been another victim.</p><br/><p> Julia played with her long hair arrogantly. Grabbing Qin Guan's feet, she planned on pulling him to the washroom to get rid of his corpse.</p><br/><p> She tried to drag him, but Qin Guan wouldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p> Julia was no athlete herself. A 186-centimeter tall adult was too heavy for her. After several attempts, the assistant director couldn't watch anymore. He wanted to put some kind of wagon under Qin Guan's body.</p><br/><p> George stopped him though. They just kept watching.</p><br/><p> \"Wow, Chuck, you\u2019ve gotten fat.\" Julia squatted down like a frog and pulled with all her might.</p><br/><p> Bang! His forehead hit the wall around the corner.</p><br/><p> Bang! It was his poor nose this time.</p><br/><p> You are too big, Qin Guan! You should lose some weight!</p><br/><p> The camera kept rolling. Qin Guan was still being dragged across the cold floor. His shirt had been nearly torn in the process. The crew couldn't bear to watch anymore. Qin Guan was crying internally, not because of his cruel treatment, but because of Julia\u2019s comments.</p><br/><p> I\u2019m not fat. My weight is average.</p><br/><p> On the way to the washroom, Julia was murmuring to herself about her victory.</p><br/><p> \"I nearly failed with Bird. You shouldn't entrust others with something you could do yourself. He wanted to kill you. Do you know that? Such a silly guy!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was lying on the floor of the washroom. Julia threw a fake posthumous paper at him, laughing at her defeated opponent.</p><br/><p> \"This sounds like your epitaph would have if you had written it yourself. Look, Chuck, I remember everything you ever told me. All your sweet words\u2026 By the way, say hi to Kari when you see him. I really liked him...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

These had been built to prevent fans and reporters from breaking in. Rongzhi had transformed the simple building into a castle with cards and codes.</p><br/><p>Wang Liying led Fan Pingping and her team to a private meeting room where Qin Guan always read scripts and enjoyed his afternoon tea.</p><br/><p>Fan felt right at home in the meeting room. She asked Qin Guan to prepare some snacks and tea for her and then stated the purpose of her visit.</p><br/><p>\"Could you please give me a chance? We come from the same town after all. Is there a script that's suitable for me? I want to be a protagonist.\"</p><br/><p>Her eagerness confused Qin Guan. In his opinion, the girl was in the prime of her life. Everyone knew her. Qin Guan fixed his eyes on her and asked, \"Isn't this your agent's job? Why did you come to me? I cannot intervene when it comes to company functions. There is an appointed CEO at Huayi. I think you'd better ask help from the person in charge of the scripts.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Yes, I know!\" Fang put her palms together devoutly. \"I didn't find any suitable scripts at Huayi, but I know you have a lot of resources. Is there perhaps a script that you turned down? Just give me a recommendation!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that Qin Guan maintained a good relationship with both the sixth and the fifth generation of directors. He had also cooperated with CCTV and China Film Group, so mainstream directors thought just as highly of him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned down dozens of scripts a month. Everyone in the entertainment circle called him a lucky boy, just like people in America had called him a lucky star.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could read her thoughts. She just wanted to share his good luck. He turned and pointed to a shelf.</p><br/><p>\"TV scripts on the left, film scripts on the right. They are all labelled by date. If you are interested in something, just call my assistant.\" Actually, a script was only the first step. The director would evaluate many aspects before choosing an actor.</p><br/><p>\"That simple?\"</p><br/><p>Fan felt as if she was at the top of the world. As she rushed over to the shelf, Qin Guan took a sip of the green tea in his hand.</p><br/><p>Not all people were equal. Fan was busy running about looking for a script while Qin Guan just sat on the couch and enjoyed his tea. A lot of people still stuffed scripts in his hands whenever he walked by them.</p><br/><p>I have to accept the reality that he is a miracle. The actress got lost in a script.</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Did you read this one, Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Which one?\"</p><br/><p>\"'Apple'! Tony Leung will be the protagonist, but the heroine has not been cast. It's a story about a nobody suffering from mishaps his entire life because of the fast development of the economy. I think it's a profound story. It stands a good chance of winning an award. Why did you turn it down?\"</p><br/><p>There was a red cross on the cover of the script, which had been lying on the shelf, covered in dust.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't even move his eyelids. The script had impressed him. It was pretty good, but it was not of any mainstream value. Qin Guan had to avoid scripts of that kind if he wanted to stay out of trouble.</p><br/><p>He looked at Fan, who was observing his expression carefully.</p><br/><p>\"If you choose this one, you have to prepare yourself mentally. There are erotic scenes included, and the heroine is not a nice person. She is just a material girl. It would be a test for your acting skills though. That's why Tony Leung agreed to it. If you want to have a signature film, this would be a good choice.\"</p><br/><p>Reassured, Fan put the script in her bag with satisfaction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

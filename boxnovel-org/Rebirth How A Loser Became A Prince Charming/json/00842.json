I just went out to buy some newspapers and the reporters caught me off guard!\"</p><br/><p>\"So what? You still bought the newspapers.\"</p><br/><p>\"Cheung came with me to throw away the garbage. We were caught! I was only wearing a pair of shorts and a tank...\"</p><br/><p>So you are blaming me for your carelessness?</p><br/><p>\"They didn't disclose the name of my girlfriend though. The photo was too blurry! How did you know my girlfriend is Cheung?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his breakfast and answered calmly.</p><br/><p>\"I figured it out based on the gossip online and the rumors circulating among the Hong Kong entertainment circle.\"</p><br/><p>Tse was speechless.</p><br/><p>\"I suggest that you contact your agency immediately and make a counter attack. As your friend, I wanted to warn you personally. Why did Ms. Cheung insist on following you out this morning? I don't want to say anything else on the matter. Remember, I'm always on your side.\"</p><br/><p>Nicolas Tse hung up and rushed to his agency. He was touched by Qin Guan's words. Ever since he had been a child, he had always lived in the public eye because of his parents. The rebellious boy had tried his best to be himself instead of the son of Patrick Tse and Deborah Lee. He was always surrounded by people, but few of them were sincere friends. It was seldom that someone warned him despite the risk of ruining their relationship.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a new friend of his, but he had done everything for his own good. His honest, sincere friend had moved him. The man, who had always longed for love, felt a long-lost warmth.</p><br/><p>He knew that this had been Cheung's plan all along, but a lover could be forgiven. Lovesick men often acted foolishly. Tse had been really silly.</p><br/><p>When his agent asked about his opinion on the disclosure of the romance, the young man nodded without hesitation. Thus, the Hong Kong Film Awards were out-shadowed by these striking news.</p><br/><p>The opening ceremony took place amid that gloomy atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The ceremony was held at the Hong Kong Cultural Center, where Hong Kong culture and art were celebrated. The building was full of artwork from different eras and all kinds of cultural artefacts. The beautiful piece of architecture had been built for culture, not for commerce.</p><br/><p>The most important Hong Kong film awards would be held there to show off the charm of Hong Kong's culture.</p><br/><p>The night view was beautiful there. The sparkling lights cheered everyone up. Qin Guan put on a forced smile and headed to the main hall of the culture center with Zhou Xun's hand locked in his. He had to be careful with his public image, so he suffered through Zhou Xun's physical and mental torture. The reporters thought he looked very solemn.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan always smiles on the red carpet. Why is he so serious today?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Look at his bitter smile!\"</p><br/><p>\"Could he be disappointed about his upcoming failure?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's possible.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had returned to the Chinese film circle after all. Chinese film festivals enjoyed an important status among the audience of the Chinese mainland.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! The award-winning actor is under pressure. What a good stunt!\"</p><br/><p>The reporters thought they had discovered the truth, but Qin Guan and Zhou Xun were having a subtle negotiation as they walked.</p><br/><p>\"It hurts. Don't pinch me, Sister Xun! It will be hard to explain to my girlfriend where I got the bruise.\"</p><br/><p>\"You insulted me! You asked that boy to pick you up from the airport instead of me! You hurt my feelings! The reporters will think that the protagonists of our film do not get along!\"</p><br/><p>\"My bad! My bad! Show mercy! Ouch!\"</p><br/><p>After a final attack, the ambassador led Qin Guan to his seat, so he managed to escape from her.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at Gillian Chung awkwardly. \"Excuse me!\"</p><br/><p>Gillian Chung was a ceremony ambassador. The position of the master of ceremony was always taken by a beautiful young actress, but the ceremony ambassadors that year were extremely pretty. It was Fiona Sit, Yumiko Cheng and Gillian Chung.</p><br/><p>Chung was the ambassador that guided Qin Guan. The shy girl flushed at his friendly smile.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan found the girl really cute, so he smiled at her again when he took a seat. The girl escaped like a blushing rabbit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

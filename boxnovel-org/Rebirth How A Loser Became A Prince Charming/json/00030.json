Qin Guan carried their luggage on his shoulders. As soon as the door opened, he went out.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's father moved forward to take the luggage as Cong Nianwei\u2019s parents hurried over.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could say a word to his father, both families began to exchange pleasantries. \u201cHow are you? I\u2019m Qin Guan\u2019s father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you? I\u2019m Cong Nianwei\u2019s father.\u201d Then they looked at each other silently. This was their first meeting. They didn\u2019t know each other at all, so they had nothing to say to keep the conversation going.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei pulled at Qin Guan's coat. He hastened to introduce her parents to his father. \u201cHow do you do, sir? Ma\u2019am? Cong Nianwei and I were classmates in senior high school. This is my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tactfully, Cong Nianwei stood behind her parents. Qin Guan's father handled the situation while he thought, \u201cWell done, dude! You come home with a girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked quite pleased with himself.</p><br/><p>At Qin Guan\u2019s words, Cong Nianwei's parents immediately became nervous. They regarded him carefully.</p><br/><p>Qing Guan hurried to add, \u201cI\u2019m also studying in the capital. Our colleges are not far from each other. It\u2019s not safe for a girl to travel alone by train, so I kept Cong Nianwei company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her parents looked relieved at his explanation. That\u2019s not too bad. The young man hadn\u2019t jumped into calling them his parents-in-law. Their heart rates slowed down gradually.</p><br/><p>After Qin Guan had set their minds at rest, they found that he was very handsome and tall. Cong Nianwei\u2019s mother looked quite satisfied with him as she asked, \u201cSo, you also study in the capital like our Weiwei? Which university are you attending?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan replied with particular politeness, \u201cThe Capital University of Finance and Economics.\u201d At his words, his father stood up straight.</p><br/><p>Realizing that Qin Guan was also studying at a famous university, Cong Nianwei\u2019s mother\u2019s impression of him got even better. He\u2019s a hard-working college student, too.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei felt like this was some kind of blind date. She pulled on the corner of her mother's clothes. They said goodbye to each other, and each of them dragged their child\u2019s luggage and left the platform.</p><br/><p>When they got home, Qin Guan and his father found Qin Guan\u2019s mother waiting by the door to welcome them. Breakfast was already on the table. Qin Guan washed his hands quickly and sat down.</p><br/><p>There were salted duck eggs, smoked sausages, steamed buns and rice porridge on the table. A complete homemade meal was right in front of Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He was starving. He finished two bowls of porridge in a hurry, washed his face and got in bed. Not long after, he fell asleep. No one could have stayed up any longer after sitting in a train the whole night.</p><br/><p>The landline phone rang and woke him up. Qin Guan checked his watch and realized that it was afternoon. His parents had to be at work.</p><br/><p>He massaged his head and answered the phone, \u201cHello? Who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>A particularly excited voice came through the receiver, \u201cAre you back, Qin Guan? This is Zhou Jing.\u201d Qin Guan looked at the receiver before he hung the phone up with a slam. He dropped down on the bed and tried to go back to sleep.</p><br/><p>The phone just wouldn\u2019t let him. It rang ceaselessly. Qing Guan was beyond annoyed. He picked the receiver again and shouted, \u201cYou brat! Stop harassing me! I\u2019ll call you after I\u2019ve gotten enough sleep. Don\u2019t you have any common sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold voice came through the receiver, \u201cQin Guan? This is Cong Nianwei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Dear me! Cong Nianwei, I thought you were Zhou Jing. I didn\u2019t mean to shout at you. How are you doing? Did you have a good rest?\u201d Qin Guan's attitude changed instantly.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei burst into laughter and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to my grandma\u2019s for the Spring Festival. I\u2019m telling you in advance that I won\u2019t be able to accompany you, in case you were planning to ask me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt disappointed. Lying on the pillow, he answered slowly, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call you. Have a good time.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he hung up the phone, Qin Guan felt listless. The holidays had finally arrived. He had planned to take advantage of the vacation to make their relationship more intimate. He hadn\u2019t expected that they\u2019d end up spending the holidays separately in different locations.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the phone rang again. Qin Guan answered gloomily, \u201cHello?\u201d It was Zhou Jing again. \u201cHey, it's me. What about our vacation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused. \u201cIt\u2019s your vacation. How would I know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing sounded nervous as he said, \u201cWill you help us or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp you do what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMake money!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had tasted the sweetness of money and was now totally dependent on Qin Guan. Qin Guan sat up straight and answered, \u201cWait a moment. Let me get this clear. You and Li Jian want to make money, is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you depending on me, then? Find a solution yourself.\u201d Qin Guan was helpless. Zhou Jing, on the other hand, was quite frank and shameless. \u201cYou major in Economics, Li Jian and I study Law and Computers. We\u2019re no good at making money!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gritted his teeth. Okay. You want to make money, eh? Wait and see. I\u2019ll exhaust you two! He gritted his teeth as he told Zhou Jing, \u201cCome to my house tomorrow with your capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other end of the line, Zhou Jing and Li Jian looked at each other. We did it! They answered immediately, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Early on the next morning, the two shameless guys bummed breakfast off at Qin Guan's house. Noticing the expression on Qin Guan's face, they took out of their pockets 200 yuan in cash.</p><br/><p>They showed Qin Guan the two notes casually, setting them on the tea table beside the sofa. Pointing to them, Qin Guan looked up and told them, \u201cAre you kidding me? This is your capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them looked ashamed as they replied, \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to save much money lately. That's all we have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Qin Guan had planned to take advantage of them, but now he just pocketed the money and said, \u201cThat's fine. We\u2019ll go prepare our stock. We\u2019re starting early tomorrow morning. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing and Li Jian followed Qin Guan obediently. They rode Qin Guan's little tricycle to the largest wholesale market in the City of Y. Qin Guan focused on nothing but the stands selling scrolls and pictures, as well as pictures of Chinese Zodiac signs in the Spring Festival merchandise section. He spent nearly all their capital on common goods at wholesale prices.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan carried all the goods to the tricycle, Zhou Jing seemed confused. \u201cAren\u2019t we selling kebab?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan regretted that his friend\u2019s offspring hadn\u2019t lived up to his expectations. He stared at Zhou Jing. \u201cWho will come out for outdoor kebab and cold beer in the freezing night before the Spring Festival?\u201d</p><br/><p>They both looked resentful as they promised to follow Qin Guan's instructions. Qin Guan sighed and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll meet at six o\u2019clock at the morning market on Haibin Road. Lets call it a day now. Go back to where you came from.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that concrete plan, they both went home happily. Qin Guan sighed again. A person shouldn't look back at his bad friends, or some silly friend will get them killed by accident. I\u2019ll get exhausted when I should be having a fun vacation.</p><br/><p>Early on the next morning, the three of them met up at the Haibin Morning Market. It was one of the largest morning markets in Y City, located by the harbor. The pedlars began their business before dawn. There were all kinds of goods sold there, including fresh fish and shrimp, fruit, vegetables, various household supplies, scarves, underwear and so on.</p><br/><p>After walking through the whole market, they discovered that there was a certain discipline and organization to it. The stands were fixed, and special market management was applied.</p><br/><p>The three of them were stunned. Shamelessly, Qin Guan played his best card. He used his looks to flatter the old women who were selling underwear and cheap bedsheets.</p><br/><p>The two women noticed a handsome young man who looked like he was freezing. His ears were red on such a cold morning. He must have a hard time doing business at that age. Poor thing!</p><br/><p>The two women immediately showed their maternal instincts by making room between their stands for Qin Guan to display his Spring Festival scroll.</p><br/><p>The three boys lay down their scrolls and yelled down the street, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, Spring Festival season is approaching! Buy a pair of scrolls for good luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Believe me, their business was quite good. The scrolls they had bought by bulk were sold out with profit. Generally speaking, a cheap pair could earn them 0.5 yuan while the more expensive Spring Festival and colourful bunny pictures could exceed the prime cost by 1 yuan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

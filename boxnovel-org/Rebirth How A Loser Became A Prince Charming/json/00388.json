The final price had been barely over the bottom price of his company. As a salesman relying on commission, he would be leading a miserable life if he relied on customers like Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Under the golden rays of the setting sun, the new car looked like an avant-garde steel sculpture in an LA art museum. The blues music signified the start of their new journey.</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan was busy with studying and work. After his morning classes, he rushed from the northest point of Manhattan to the southest.</p><br/><p>They were still shooting in Eric's home. When they got out of the bathroom, the two boys arranged their belongings silently.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was dressed in black. He stuffed his policeman pants into his military boots. The fitting waistcoat used for field operations was fastened around his upper body.</p><br/><p>His backpack was filled with light bombs. A mini submachine gun was in his hand, and a backup pistol was in his pocket. Alex was watching Qin Guan in admiration as he tied a camouflage kerchief around his head.</p><br/><p>They drove to school, discussing their attacking routes on the way. One would head to the left and one to the right. They would surround everyone and then start killing them.</p><br/><p>The sunshine shone through the French windows, but nobody felt warm.</p><br/><p>The camera followed the running car, witnessing the slaughter plan gradually come to life. Eric, the weakest boy in school, had thought up a professional plan worthy of a special operation team. The script was based on real events that had happened in the US, so the role of Eric was based on a real person.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at school, the director let out a breath of relief. The smile on Qin Guan\u2019s face looked horrific.</p><br/><p>Innocent brutality was the most horrible. The boys would kill innocent students, the principal, and then each other with a smile on their faces. The audience couldn't sense any emotions on them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Alex got out of the car with their weapons. They stood at the entrance of the school leisurely. Eric let John, the kind boy shown earlier in the film, go. The boy had a kind heart despite all the hardships he had been through.</p><br/><p>Then the two of them began their attack. All the disorderly earlier scenes suddenly came together, reaching a conclusion.</p><br/><p>Some of the students lived, while others died. The film was partly dedicated to the memory of the deceased.</p><br/><p>The camera started filming. John went out of the office of the principal slowly, looking sad. Then he met Eric, the boy who had been bullied and humiliated at school just as much as he had.</p><br/><p>His classmate was not a coward anymore. Instead, he had become cruel and evil.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, dude. What are you doing here?\" John asked Eric in concern.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked solemn in his black kerchief. \"Piss off! Get as far away as possible! Don\u2019t come back!\"</p><br/><p>That was his final cold greeting. The sensitive boy ran away like an animal. On his way, he looked back time and again, trying to warn every student and teacher.</p><br/><p>\"Stay away! Don\u2019t enter the school! Something big is about to happen...\"</p><br/><p>He had hardly finished speaking when the building behind him exploded.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Alex had entered the building, which would be the beginning of the massacre. Before the librarian could say anything, a bloody flower bloomed on her chest.</p><br/><p>There was no counter-attack. In barely a few seconds, they had killed everyone in the library. A boy who had appeared at the beginning of the film was holding his camera in his hand as he died. In the camera was the final shot of his two schoolmates, who were about to kill him.</p><br/><p>Following their plan, one of them headed left, and the other right. Gus\u2019 camera followed Qin Guan's face and movements quietly.</p><br/><p>The boy didn\u2019t look flurried or excited after the killings. His boots stomped on the wooden floor. That echo was the final sound of the concert of his life. He moved along the corridor until he found his arch enemy, the demon who had been bullying him every day.</p><br/><p>With his slender arms and legs and his cold face, Qin Guan looked like the God of Vengeance. The camera retreated before him as the crew got absorbed in his performance.</p><br/><p>\"He was more than good enough to be the leading actor. The box office will be great!\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't want Qin Guan to go that way. Look at his acting skills! Commercial films would be an insult to him...\"</p><br/><p>They were actually afraid that the fat salary of commercial films would win him over.</p><br/><p>In three minutes, Qin Guan had reached the place of the real massacre. It was the school cafeteria, where the students had been driven by the shots.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

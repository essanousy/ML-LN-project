Young people began to run after him like wolves.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"I was right!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's the star of our city! Catch him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Go! Go!\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing was knocked down by the crowd. When he came back to his senses and stood up again, everything was a mess. He realized he had unintentionally harmed his friend.</p><br/><p>After looking around for a bit, he threw the garbage into the trash can and returned home with his hands behind his back.</p><br/><p>It was not my fault, Qin Guan. You should have let me know in advance. People in love tend to die young...</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing forgave himself as his friend ran away.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Stop! We are not animals!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I just want to kiss you! No, hug you... No, touch you...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was riding away with all his strength.</p><br/><p>\"Hurry, hurry!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had experienced the might of his crazy fans before. They were following the bike like an army on a march. Some young men even tried to intercept them. It felt like they were being surrounded by zombies.</p><br/><p>\"There's a slope over there!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nonsense! It will only slow us down!\"</p><br/><p>\"We'll go downhill, you idiot!\"</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\"</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan took a sharp turn, sparkles flew between the wheels and the ground. The two of them headed down the long slope.</p><br/><p>The head of the bear had completely covered Cong Nianwei's face, so she had to close her eyes and bury her face into its fur. The fans slowed down. They knew that the bike would get away after the slope.</p><br/><p>A few old men were chatting by the entrance of the alley.</p><br/><p>\"What are they doing? Are they chasing a thief?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. It can't be a thief though. No thief would run into a dead end.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are right!\"</p><br/><p>The sad crowd suddenly cheered up. \"Yes!\" They all sped up towards the alley.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei, who had reached the end of the alley, got off the bike and looked at the short wall innocently.</p><br/><p>\"A dead end?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm not familiar with the area...\"</p><br/><p>Before they could figure out a plan, they heard voices.</p><br/><p>\"Do you see the dead end?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, it's a long alley. Could Qin Guan have entered one of the houses?\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! I don't see his bicycle around.\"</p><br/><p>They sounded like Sherlock Holmes.</p><br/><p>Unwilling to surrender, Qin Guan made a decision.</p><br/><p>\"Climb over the wall, Wei!\"</p><br/><p>Back at school, Qin Guan had been good at climbing walls. He and some other boys would climb over the wall of their school to skip class.</p><br/><p>He put his idea into practice at once, squatting down so Cong Nianwei could step on his back.</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up! Use my neck!\" Cong Nianwei put the bear on her head and mounted his neck.</p><br/><p>\"Go!\"</p><br/><p>This was one of the advantages of being tall. Cong Nianwei reached the top of the wall. Fortunately, there were no pieces of glass or nails on it, so she jumped.</p><br/><p>\"You go first. Let me be!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei calmly swung her other leg over and sat on the wall. By that time, the first fans had craned their necks around the corner. Qin Guan threw the bike over the wall with effort and took a few steps back without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Then he ran forward and used his hands to reach the top of the wall, channelling all his strength to his arms. At least that was what his fans saw him do.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

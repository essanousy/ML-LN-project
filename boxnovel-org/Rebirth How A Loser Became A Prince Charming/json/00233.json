Neither Citizen nor A.M. invited any media today. According to the schedule, our first news conference will be on the day of brand launch event. Where did they come from?\"</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they had found out themselves. In 2001, mainstream media had begun to transform into network media. With the popularity of the internet increasing, some websites, both in China and abroad, had started a business in that underdeveloped market.</p><br/><p>Websites such as Xilang, Soulang, Wangnan and Yatu started emerging like mushrooms after the rain. Their news releases were much swifter and more comprehensive than the traditional media\u2019s, and their reporters were in on everything.</p><br/><p>Thanks to an inside man who focused on the Japanese entertainment circle, Kyoko Fukada had been spotted at the capital airport.</p><br/><p>That man was also a freelance reporter at Yatu. No secret could be kept in the media circle. Once one reporter knew, they all knew.</p><br/><p>All the websites had sent reporters to wait outside the Citizen building in hopes of getting the scoop.</p><br/><p>Their chance had come. A man had followed Kyoko Fukada out of the building. According to their understanding of the girl, they thought there was a possibility of a romance between her and that handsome guy.</p><br/><p>At the time, there had been no net police, so anyone could write anything they wanted.</p><br/><p>If the person mentioned in the news sued, the website just added the caption \"reported by net users and reproduced by the website\" to the article and kept themselves out of trouble.</p><br/><p>Several brave reporters rushed over as the photographers started taking pictures like crazy. Those photos would be useful in the future.</p><br/><p>\"Kyoko, did you come to China for work? Are you cooperating with Citizen? Are you Citizen\u2019s ambassador this year?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ms. Fukada, is that man your new boyfriend?\"</p><br/><p>Several wretched reporters tried to squeeze her crew away. Only one reporter, who was on his first day at the job, aimed for Qin Guan. He cast a glance at Kyoko Fukada.</p><br/><p>That day was definitely his lucky day. As an expert on the fashion industry, he always paid attention to that circle. Qin Guan had been the No.1 male model that year, so he had naturally attracted his attention.</p><br/><p>He pointed his poor recorder at Qin Guan and asked, \"Qin Guan, are you Citizen\u2019s ambassador this year? Did you cooperate with Kyoko Fukada? When will the news be officially released?\"</p><br/><p>That reporter has a keen sense of news. His questions are good.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stopped and answered the questions hurriedly, \"Yes, I signed a contract with Citizen to be the ambassador of their new mechanical watches. The date of the press conference will be announced on their website. Kyoko is my work partner.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter was excited to see his idol answer his questions patiently. \"What activities will you participate in in the following days? Your fans are eager to see you in new films and TV shows.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at him. \"Tell my fans that three new TV shows will be aired this year. It will be their lucky year. I\u2019m sorry to say I\u2019ll only be co-starring again though.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he saw the other reporters turn towards him after bothering Kyoko. He hastened to wave at the reporter and run away with his friends.</p><br/><p>A line of cars left with a roar.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck, we were too late! That guy looked familiar. I\u2019ve been seeing him on TV a lot lately.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't you know him? Haven\u2019t you seen his advertisements? He is famous in the advertising circle. He\u2019s a guarantee of success and big sales. He\u2019s just as good as a box office guarantee!\"</p><br/><p>\"Awesome! We rarely read any news about him though.\"</p><br/><p>\"He hasn\u2019t acted in that many films or TV shows. He is actually a model. What fans would be interested in an advertisement actor? He sure was a surprise today though!\"</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s a handsome man. He must be in a relationship with Kyoko! She is the Stamp-Collecting Queen after all!\"</p><br/><p>When they finished their discussion, they walked up to the reporter who had just interviewed Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Hey bro, did you interview Qin Guan? Share with us, okay? That's routine, provided it won\u2019t make the headlines. We can share what Kyoko Fukada said with you.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter held his recorder tightly in his arms and ran up to his photographer. \"Never! I don't need Kyoko!\"</p><br/><p>They looked at each other as the reporter escaped like a scared rabbit.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! We came here for nothing!\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no! Wait!\" One of them took the camera and smiled proudly, saying with lively gestures, \"Look... Like this\u2026 Here...\"</p><br/><p>They all burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Inauspicious dark clouds started gathering above Qin Guan's head.</p><br/><p>The next day was Saturday. It was sunny, which was ideal weather for sleeping in. Qin Guan was kissing Cong Nianwei in his dream, when his phone suddenly started ringing.</p><br/><p>He took it out of his bag. It was not his alarm. Someone was calling him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan answered in a sleepy voice, \"Sister Xue? What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter? Go online at once! Visit any mainstream website! Read the Entertainment Section! You are everywhere! Do it fast!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

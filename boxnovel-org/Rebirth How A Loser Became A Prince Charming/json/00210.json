Surprise! I\u2019m not boasting. Stop laughing at me! How did you guys dare belittle my taste and call me blind?\"</p><br/><p>Hey, we are all professionals here. Don't act crazy!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang broke the charged atmosphere, and the other directors began to ask each other questions.</p><br/><p>Among the sixth generation, some directors were renowned and some were not. Many of them had won awards overseas, but the majority were still nobodies at the time. Some of them were hunted by the government for their underground films. Only a few of them could actually make profits. Most of them had nothing at all.</p><br/><p>They made jokes with their three new friends and drank to their heart's content. Nobody talked about money or sordid merchants.</p><br/><p>Finally, all the rivers flowed into the same sea. They reached the most concerning topic.</p><br/><p>\"Do you have any new plans? You have to lead the way for young men.\"</p><br/><p>\"Here are some volunteer actors. They\u2019re the best support for us. Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>They all roared with laughter. It was great to have free actors again! The muscles on Huang Bo's face twisted slightly. Where are all the high taste directors? Where\u2019s my reward? This is beyond my imagination!</p><br/><p>\"Stop beating around the bush! Let\u2019s talk business! Who will get investors and make new films in 2001 and 2002? Hands up!\"</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed. Only the sound of people chewing peanuts could be heard.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan spoke first, \"As you all know, I spent all my money on \u2018Beijing Bastard\u2019, but the film didn't pass the investigation. I secretly participated in the Tokyo Film Festival with it, which irritated the Competition Department. Before I could explain, they forbade me to shoot another film again. Those sons of b*tches! It\u2019s so unfair. That big film studio robbed me! They cancelled our contract for renting lights and cameras...\"</p><br/><p>\"I lost everything! I even had to sell my pants at a pawnshop. The situation was getting worse and worse. No film or TV studio was allowed to cooperate with me. I\u2019m Zhang Yuan though! I participated in competitions secretly. I shot commentary films to make money! They couldn\u2019t control me! I won an award in Venice! I fought back! Then the ban was revoked. I could shoot anything I liked. My film \u2018Going Home for the Spring Festival\u2019 was in theaters in China. Do they admire me? Those sons of b*tches! That\u2019s my strength!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang kicked Zhang Yuan on the leg. \"Stop boasting. We were talking about how young men can seize opportunities! Tell us about your plan!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan shouted at him indifferently, \"I have no money for films! After all this effort, my film didn't earn its budget back! I have a family to support! Who would invest in my films? Can I even live on indie films? If you want to make profits, you have to be obedient. They are watching you from above. I\u2019ll be waiting for the motherland\u2019s arrangements. I have resigned myself to my destiny.\"</p><br/><p>His head fell down on the table unconsciously. He was already drunk.</p><br/><p>The other men smiled bitterly. Jia Zhangke said, \"You know, my shooting style is the same as other independent film producers\u2019. I engage in international releases. I have nothing to do with the domestic film market. Would you like to act in films like that?\"</p><br/><p>\"To tell you the truth, Qin Guan, you\u2019d never get a part in my films. Even if you covered your face with mud, you would still not look like a poor man. You\u2019d seem more like a prince facing a misfortune. Foreigners don't expect to see such actors in my films. I could look for roles for Huang Bo, but not this year. Right now I\u2019m obsessed with my new documentary \u2018Public Places\u2019, which is financed by foreign investors. I\u2019ll win another award for it. You could ask Lao Lou, he\u2019s the most literary one among us. Everything in his films is extremely beautiful.</p><br/><p>\"You didn't see his film \u2018River in Suzhou\u2019. If you don\u2019t beautify outdoor scenes, you know the results. Tell them, Lao Lou.\"</p><br/><p>Lou Ye touched his nose in shame. \"This is self-dramatizing. I\u2019m only an aesthete with romantic feelings. Wait for me, Qin Guan. I\u2019ll give you a part in my next film. It's fixed. It\u2019s a pity that I can't use Zhou Xun as the heroine though. There\u2019s a large difference in height between you two. I couldn't ask you to bend down for the whole film.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha!\" They all liked jokes about actresses. Those rough directors had no idea how famous they would become in the future. In the deep dark night, even the moon seemed to be asleep. They drank and laughed happily.</p><br/><p>When the first ray of light shone through the broken roof, the drunk talented men fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue managed to get up and lead the two guys out of the secret warehouse. The two of them were quite different from each other.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had a great spirit, and he had learned a lot from that conversation. He now knew about film concepts and skills, as well as about passionate, beautiful stories.</p><br/><p>During that sleepless night, he\u2019d heard the voices, thoughts and future concepts of a whole generation of directors. He hadn't fully expressed his own opinion though.</p><br/><p>Huang Bo, on the other side, had earned compliments from all the directors who engaged in films about real life. In a daze, he remembered countless shadows telling him the same thing, \"You\u2019ll be the protagonist in my next film.\"</p><br/><p>That was enough for him to go to bed reassured.</p><br/><p>They walked along the dirty path. After that overnight meeting, they were feeling hungry. The breakfast stand at the end of the industrial area was the perfect solution to their problem.</p><br/><p>In that plant area full of ruins and waste, the three mini casseroles they bought were like a feast in fairyland.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

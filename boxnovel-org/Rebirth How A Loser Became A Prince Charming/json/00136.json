He expressed his endless feeling of resentment to the long queue outside the LEE store, which sold only torn jeans.</p><br/><p>After carefully scrutinizing Qin Guan\u2019s poster, he gritted his teeth and signed the tenancy contract with the Leasing Department of the Plaza.</p><br/><p>The rent was about three times higher than that of his stores in other areas, but he had high hopes for the future.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qin Guan finished his exams the next morning, he was taken to the J clothing headquarters by Sister Xue. The contract came into effect immediately. They went into a J clothing van, heading for the 4A company to shoot a TV advertisement.</p><br/><p>The director who met them had originally been unsatisfied with the customer for picking a model in advance. Based on his analysis of J clothing, he had already chosen several good candidates for the advertisement, considering the brand\u2019s rising status, audience and budget. Domestic models such as Huang Haibin and Ren Quan were all popular stars.</p><br/><p>He didn't care about the choice the boss had made for the poster and T show, but only a famous model would qualify for a TV advertisement.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan got out of the car though, the director was stunned. The models he favored were ordinary people compared to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Relaxing, he asked his assistant to lead Qin Guan to the makeup room, while he stayed outside to finish the preparations with the J clothing staff.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went out of the makeup room and saw some figurants in the studio, who would serve as background in the advertisement.</p><br/><p>While the leading actor would be running, they would follow him around to create momentum. When the leading actor was still, they would stay behind him like wallflowers.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan saw his old acquaintance, Ouyang Fen.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen's expression was thunderous when Qin Guan came out. They had been the winner and runner-up of the same national competition. The gap between the two of them was not that broad. Besides, Qin Guan was just an amateur model in Ouyang Fen\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>However, Qin Guan had overcome countless obstacles and conventions in the modelling circle.</p><br/><p>Convention I. It was difficult for an amateur model to sign a contract with a formal agency, as most amateurs models were not qualified enough. However, Qin Guan had been pestered to sign a contract with a formal agency for several months.</p><br/><p>Convention II. It was difficult for amateur models to win domestic contests. Most models were promoted to C Level after signing a contract and stayed at that level for all their lives. Without strong financial support from the agency, it was very difficult to win a domestic contest. It was like the 25,000 kilometer Long March of the Red Army.</p><br/><p>Still, it had been easy and smooth for Qin Guan, who had just drifted along with the current. He had cleverly chosen a competition for new models without latent rules and a clear winner. With the approval of both the judges and designers, he had won plenty of awards in his first competition.</p><br/><p>After the competition, he had been promoted to B Level. Ouyang Fen gave him a forced smile. Qin Guan got himself a brand endorsement, while I\u2019m still stuck in the background.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked to the centre of the studio. To Ouyang Fen\u2019s surprise, he didn't sneer at him. He just patted his shoulder without a word.</p><br/><p>The director\u2019s voice woke Ouyang up. He was slightly shocked, but he felt warm in his heart. Maybe Qin Guan is a good man after all!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan greeted the director in cotton knitwear, a waistcoat and leisurely pants.</p><br/><p>\"Have you shot a commercial before?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know how to follow a camera?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"Do you have any related training or experience?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded before adding, \"Most of my experience is on printed media and photos.\"</p><br/><p>The director exhaled in relief before telling Qin Guan, \"Just relax and imagine that this is you in your everyday life. Do what I said, but don't drift too far from the camera. The sense of the lens is inbred. I have confidence in you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had gained himself another admirer. The shooting began, and the figurants followed Qin Guan as he ran around and leapt. The first film was finished fast.</p><br/><p>The director gasped in admiration at Qin Guan's performance. No wonder that models had the best lens sense. They can always find the best angle for shooting. Even the smile on his face is just right!</p><br/><p>The scene was finished during the second film, as the figurants had been running in the wrong order at the beginning.</p><br/><p>The second scene was simpler. They just chased each other on circling stairs.</p><br/><p>The final scene was shot at the top of the mansion. When they climbed to the top breathlessly, Qin Guan was surprised to see a roof lawn.</p><br/><p>The company seemed to have spent a lot on the advertisement. The director of A.M wouldn't tell anyone about it, but they had evaluated J clothing as a senior customer with great potential.</p><br/><p>This meant that if the boss of the J shirts was satisfied with their work, there would be another contract.</p><br/><p>In the final scene, Qin Guan was chased by everyone else. People tore at his clothes to express their inner desire as Qin Guan shamelessly exposed a part of his chest.</p><br/><p>When the director said that they were done, Qin Guan was confused. It had felt like a camera had been recording his daily activities.</p><br/><p>He watched the playback doubtfully. In the special subdued light, his features were magnified naturally. His long legs were moving in perfect rhythm as the camera got closer. His sexy butt was clear in the leisurely pants. In the natural light of the setting sun, Qin Guan stood still among everyone else. He was the most dazzling person in the frame.</p><br/><p>He had been born a leading actor.</p><br/><p>After the shooting, Qin Guan was approved by A.M, one of the top three 4A companies in the capital.</p><br/><p>They filled Qin Guan\u2019s name in the \"optional\" column and wrote a \"B\" silently next to it.</p><br/><p>Considering his popularity and audience though, the director should have written an \"A\".</p><br/><p>After the work was done, Qin Guan got a text notification about a bank transfer. Deducting Sister Xue's payment, 60,000 yuan had fallen right into his pocket.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

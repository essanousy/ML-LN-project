Well-informed agencies would send them for the distinguished guests.</p><br/><p>The Xie family was rich, so they did not spare any expenses. Thus, there were many charming women among the aged men.</p><br/><p>Rich men were always old, so Qin Guan ended up becoming the center of attention. He was young, successful, rich and handsome!</p><br/><p>All the people around Qin Guan looked the same. The confident girls walked over as if by accident.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" A soft voice attracted the men's attention. They suddenly saw a girl in a white dress fall before them in an elegant manner. She seemed to go through layers of curtains in front of the balcony before finally reaching that exact spot.</p><br/><p>Her fair neck and slender legs indicated that she was a pretty girl. As experienced men, they were all familiar with such tricks.</p><br/><p>Men had many deep-rooted bad habits though. Such an incident would be interesting if it posed no risk for their interests. Thus, a few young men spoke up. The Thai language sounded gentle when the speakers were not upset.</p><br/><p>\"Alas! Are you okay, young lady? Do you need any help?\"</p><br/><p>The man closest to the girl stretched his hand out.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you!\" The girl looked up at him with watery eyes. She was a really beautiful woman, a fact that satisfied the man.</p><br/><p>Before their hands could touch, the curtains opened again and the warm air of the party drifted out to the balcony. Some gentlemen frowned at the sudden disturbance. When they saw what was happening clearly, they were intrigued.</p><br/><p>An excited girl rushed out, pushed the young man away and pulled the weak girl up from the floor.</p><br/><p>\"Poy, you are here! How did you fall down? Get up, quick!\"</p><br/><p>The girl on the floor couldn't help but stand up. She was confused by the unexpected competitor.</p><br/><p>The second girl bowed before everyone in gratitude.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry for the trouble. Thank you for being kind to my friend.\"</p><br/><p>Her beautiful boobs were visible in her low-cut dress when she bent over.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan burst into laughter at the interesting actresses. If Xie Hanren had not pulled him back, he would have fallen down from the balcony.</p><br/><p>If the two women used their acting skills in their performance, they would become award-winning actresses one day. Qin Guan's abrupt laughter made the crowd calm down. The two girls turned in unison towards the man who had dared laugh at them openly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they screamed out.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Their Chinese was pretty good!</p><br/><p>\"In the flesh!\"</p><br/><p>They immediately forgot about their sponsors. There were rich men everywhere, but there was only one Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The girl in the white dress started looking for a pen to get an autograph, while the girl in red rushed back to the curtains and disappeared from the balcony.</p><br/><p>Everyone stood there in confusion. No one knew what to say.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stepped away from the edge of the balcony awkwardly, afraid that those crazy girls might push him down.</p><br/><p>Before the girl in white could reach her idol, Qin Guan saw Wang Liying come out of the curtains and gesture at him.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me. I have something to do. I'll be back as soon as I can.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked over to Wang and entered the hall. Then he realized what was going on.</p><br/><p>The girl in red was really smart. She had analyzed the pros and cons quickly and decided not to stay on the balcony. Instead, she had found her agent as fast as she could. What an opportunity! If she could get on the same boat as Qin Guan, she would get plenty of chances to ask for an autograph!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

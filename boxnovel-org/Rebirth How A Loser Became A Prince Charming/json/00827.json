Although he had high standards, Qin Guan didn't find anything wrong with his costume. The black traditional Chinese garment and red scarf were his favorite things in the entire Spring Festival.</p><br/><p>Harlem Yu fixed his eyes on him as Qin Guan went out of the fitting room. He chatted with Qin Guan as the stylist was working on him.</p><br/><p>\"During the Golden Horse Festival, I wanted to tell you that few people could look as good as Andy Lau when standing next to him. If I was not backstage, I would have come to introduce myself. You four impressed me a lot.\"</p><br/><p>Nicolas Tse remained silent. He was not good at talking to strangers. He just looked at Qin Guan with envy. All the aspiring actors in Hong Kong considered Tony Leung, Chiu Wai and Andy Lau their idols. The young man, who had relied on his father's fame as well as his own ability to make headlines, was currently in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>As a real award-winning actor the same age as him sat beside him, the proud young man fell silent.</p><br/><p>The professional stylist was really good at his job. He finished as soon as possible, gave Wang his number, and left the private fitting room to go help his colleagues.</p><br/><p>Although this was only a rehearsal, some makeup was still necessary.</p><br/><p>The three men began chatting. Yu was actually a really funny guy. Although he was 20 years older than Qin Guan, he was a lot like a young man. The man was a real chatterbox. Before the other guys could get annoyed to death, an assistant walked in.</p><br/><p>\"The singing and dancing performance will end in 32 seconds. The actors of the next act should get to the entrance. When you hear the announcement, you can get on the stage through entrance No.1 and entrance No.3. Is everything clear?\"</p><br/><p>The three men nodded and fixed their eyes on the indicator lights. When they turned green, they would need to get on the stage through the different entrances.</p><br/><p>The dancers were already in position. When the prelude came, they began performing.</p><br/><p>The actors had to control the atmosphere. They couldn't seem too weak compared to the dancers around them or too powerful compared to the girl sword-fighting behind them.</p><br/><p>The dancers filled the stage, creating a commotion. The girl had to be very well-connected. The innocuous method of stuffing actors into galas was prevailing in China. The bigger the gala was, the more frequent that phenomenon was.</p><br/><p>The audience might feel strange about some nondescript dancers or acrobats in the background, but those actors were included in the gala to comfort some relative cultural industry or unlucky competitor.</p><br/><p>They all just had to have a good time together.</p><br/><p>The three men ignored the sword-fighting girl completely. They just followed the cameras solemnly and paid close attention to each other. They finished their performance smoothly. Thanks to the girl, who was holding a cool sword behind their backs, they had to be serious about their job.</p><br/><p>After they repeated the song three times, the assistant director stopped them. Then the director and the members of the organizing committee voted by raising their hands. They had passed the second rehearsal.</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>The three men shrugged. By that time, the girl had picked up her sword and was standing next to them for the curtain call. She glanced at them with a proud expression in her eyes and then walked out first.</p><br/><p>The three men, who felt uncertain about her, started talking as they walked. \"Who is she?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. Yu and I are not from here.\"</p><br/><p>They acted all innocent and cute as they waited for Qin Guan's answer.</p><br/><p>Wang Liying took out her notebook immediately and explained. She had done her homework.</p><br/><p>\"She is Li Fei from Macau. Although it's a tiny place, it's still a part of the gala. She is the most popular actor in Macao. She was born in Guanxi and she is a national martial arts champion. The director asked her to play to her strengths. You shouldn't expect an athlete to sing with a professional actor and singer after all.\"</p><br/><p>The girl just had good connections. That explained why she was so confident.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

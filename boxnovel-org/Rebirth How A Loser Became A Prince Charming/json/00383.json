There were so many holes! It was a really difficult case. Besides, you lied to me. This guy is very dangerous!\"</p><br/><p> They were arguing over the money, when suddenly a short man appeared at the back door and told Xu, \"Our leader is missing. Could you please direct me to Master Xu?\"</p><br/><p> Xu pointed in Han\u2019s direction, thus putting an end to his mission. Zhou stuffed his payment into his bag and then fixed his eyes on Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p> \"My beautiful lady, may I have a look at your slender feet?\"</p><br/><p> Goosebumps appeared on Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei\u2019s skin like mushrooms. That guy was really annoying.</p><br/><p> He was still a professional doctor though. Taking his tools in his hand, Zhou suddenly turned serious. He treated Cong Nianwei\u2019s wounds carefully.</p><br/><p> When he stood up, Qin Guan stretched his hand out to him. \"Thank you so much for helping my girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p> I have to stake my claim now, or that playboy will keep thinking about Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p> All the lamps had been turned on for the surgery. As Zhou held the hand of the young man, the bright lights and Qin Guan\u2019s smile made him dizzy.</p><br/><p> I like women. No, men... Ugh!</p><br/><p> It was like touching a burning iron. Zhou drew his hand back fast for fear that it would melt because of that splendid smile.</p><br/><p> By then, Xiao Hengzi, the smartest member of the Black Star Union had finished his report to Han. Han knew that that night had not been just a holiday for monsters and ghosts in New York, but also one for Japanese gangsters. After a long time, they had finally exposed their teeth.</p><br/><p> His gang had not been the only one attacked. Nineteen black gangs, the Russian harbour union, and the construction sites of Irish and Mexican groups had all been attacked by unknown forces.</p><br/><p> We looked down on you, Yamaguchi Tsutomu. We looked down on Japanese gangsters, while you were taking advantage of the economic depression. For the Chinese, this was both a matter of national and personal hatred. They were happy to pick up the glove.</p><br/><p> ...</p><br/><p> The moon was shining in the sky. After all those soul-stirring incidents, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei collapsed on their soft bed and fell asleep.</p><br/><p> That night, many people were destined not to sleep peacefully. Scared, the monsters on the streets returned to their own world. There were gangsters looking hurriedly for murderers on silent roads.</p><br/><p> In a luxurious apartment on the Upper East Side, Yamaguchi Tsutomu was processing Qin Guan's photos carefully on her computer. As a Japanese girl pursuing perfection, she wanted to make that poster look like artwork.</p><br/><p> Xue Wanyi was busy those days, as Qin Guan's magazine and perfume projects had been finished. Chinese people had no interest in Halloween. In the daytime, all reports concerning the entertainment circle had been updated.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's TV series were enjoying rising audience ratings. The series reached its peak after the news about Qin Guan were released.</p><br/><p> On the screen, the handsome monk Xuzhu continued his affair with Princess Xixia. On the streets, full-page reports were everywhere.</p><br/><p> The titles were tasteful, and the photos were striking.</p><br/><p> \"Close encounter between elegant Armani and a mysterious ancient country\"</p><br/><p> \"Top Columbia student wins at life\"</p><br/><p> \"Unstoppable: An overseas report on Qin Guan\"</p><br/><p> Various photos of Qin Guan on the show were on the covers of the top five fashion magazines.</p><br/><p> Ordinary Chinese people had no idea how the fashion circle worked. The word of Armani, the New York Fashion Week and VOGUE was enough for them.</p><br/><p> There was also a happy surprise. The unknown cosmetics magazine had been noticed by the Chinese.</p><br/><p> Some international magazines also paid attention to it, wondering if they could introduce it in Asia, like they had done with ELLE and VOGUE.</p><br/><p> Of course, the two directors were the happiest.</p><br/><p> Zhang Jizhong applied for the Silver Eagle Award and the \"Five Ones\" with his work \"Demi-Gods and Demi-Demons\", which was going even better thanks to Qin Guan's fame.</p><br/><p> Zhang Yimou was glad about the fact that all the cast of \"Heroes\" was enjoying international fame. Even an ordinary assassin was now a top Asian model in New York. This would be a good starting point for applying for the Oscars.</p><br/><p> Sister Xue hung up the phone with a smile. She had gotten another piece of good news.</p><br/><p> If everything went according to plan, Qin Guan would be joining Director Zhang Yimou in Los Angeles for a publicity conference before the award ceremony instead of the leading actors.</p><br/><p> She was really excited that she had agreed to the contract with Armani. If Qin Guan was in front of her, Sister Xue would have kissed him.</p><br/><p> ...</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was still living a quiet campus life. Of course, because of the shooting tragedy, Columbia University had increased security around all the entrances.</p><br/><p> American people, who were very protective of their privacy, didn't protest the regular security checks in their lockers. Their fellow students who were in the hospital served as a lesson learned from the tragedy.</p><br/><p> After a few days, everyone recovered from the terrible event. Prof. Martin was angry at the two crazy men sitting in his office though. How dared they threaten him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

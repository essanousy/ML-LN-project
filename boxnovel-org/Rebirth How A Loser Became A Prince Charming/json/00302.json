It hurts!\"</p><br/><p> Several people burst into laughter.</p><br/><p> The director cast them a warning glance, and everyone fell silent again.</p><br/><p> The immortal-like monk was so funny! The quick shift in his attitude had confused them.</p><br/><p> To be honest, with such a natural performance, Qin Guan could become the best comedian in China.</p><br/><p> By that time, Qin Guan had left the sorrowful tree and begun to chant Buddhist prayers.</p><br/><p> \"Okay!\" Director Zhang shouted in satisfaction. The whole crew relaxed.</p><br/><p> The shocked action director gave Qin Guan a thumbs up. The crew set the bar very high for him.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan finished the next scene perfectly.</p><br/><p> He looked like a simple, honest acolyte accompanying his master.</p><br/><p> That day\u2019s work was finished. The crew and the actors started packing up the props and their belongings. Qin Guan found Huang Bo and Sister Xue.</p><br/><p> The styling team muddled through the figurants. Huang Bo's costume reminded Qin Guan of the green hands in Japanese boy streets.</p><br/><p> Huang was satisfied with his role though, as he actually got to use props this time. He had a high streamer of about two meters with three big words on it: Boundless Supernatural Power.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan found out that his character was a minion of Constellation Immortal.</p><br/><p> Before he could sneer at him, Huang bust into laughter at his bare head.</p><br/><p> \"Hey! I didn\u2019t laugh at your appearance!\"</p><br/><p> Huang Bo showed Qin Guan his shabby clothes proudly. \"Sister Xue found this role for me! I have lines! I\u2019ll get 100 yuan more than ordinary extras!\"</p><br/><p> \"What lines?\"</p><br/><p> \"Constellation Immortal is the best in the world!\"</p><br/><p> Stop! I know you will be a successful comedian in the future, but you can stop joking now.</p><br/><p> They all drove to the silent mountain.</p><br/><p> The next scenes would take place at the famous Exquisite Composition. Wuyazi had finally decided to select a student. They would play a chess game as a test.</p><br/><p> The cameras were arranged at the right places. The black and white chess pieces were hanging on the cliff and the walls. The ground on the hills seemed mysterious.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan would shoot his first scene with the leading actors.</p><br/><p> As the only son of the King of Dali, Duan Yu was proficient at lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting. He had been invited there, as he was obsessed with the Composition.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan, who was looking for his master, was blocked by Duan Yu's servants.</p><br/><p> \"Stay away from here! Don't trouble our master!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was confused. Duan Yu, who was good-tempered, wasn\u2019t happy with his impolite servants.</p><br/><p> \"Don\u2019t be so rude!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was let in. He looked at the chessboard blankly. He was a simple young man, ignorant when it came to worldly affairs.</p><br/><p> Xuzhu was not an idiot. He just lacked any social skills.</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s just a composition. Why does it have such a mysterious name?\"</p><br/><p> Duan Yu kindly reminded him not to say such things. That was a really profound composition.</p><br/><p> Zhang Jizhong was satisfied. The important part had just begun. Constellation Immortal was presented.</p><br/><p> Huang Bo burst in with the high steamer, shouting his lines. Constellation Immortal began his conversation with Su Xinghe.</p><br/><p> Xuzhu saw the old man in the crowd and ran over happily.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m here to find my great uncle!\" he said with the joy and admiration of a child.</p><br/><p> Ding Cunqiu noticed that the onlookers were all gentlefolk and famous martial artists. He didn\u2019t feel worried. \"Fine,\" he said calmly. \"So we are friends.\"</p><br/><p> He cast a fierce glance at Qin Guan, who retreated and hid behind his uncle.</p><br/><p> Great! Safety first. That was the best choice for such a young man on his first journey to that dangerous world.</p><br/><p> Huang Bo was used to Qin Guan's acting skills, but the other figurants were amused by his performance.</p><br/><p> In our village, children would cry for their parents if they were bullied like that!</p><br/><p> The main actors came one after the other, pushing the plot to its climax.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stole glances at the newcomers.</p><br/><p> Liu Yifei was there. She was only 16 at the time, a school-age girl. She still had a baby face.</p><br/><p>No wonder Director Zhang had insisted on inviting her to portray the important role of Wang Yuyan and the entirely imaginary immortal sister.</p><br/><p>[1] From now on, the plot will refer to details of Jin Yong\u2019s wuxia novels.

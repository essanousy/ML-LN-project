The princess married him for his looks.\"</p><br/><p>Hu, who was really satisfied with Qin Guan's casting, shook her head. \"You are too narrow-minded. His elder sister wasn't dishonored after giving birth to a child. Intelligence can't explain everything. She'd have to be a true beauty, and so would her brother.\"</p><br/><p>Okay, that sounds reasonable. Thanks for the explanation. Let's start on the next scene as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Actually, in a large organization, capability was the key to everything. After the first scene, no one complained about Qin Guan's acting skills anymore. That was the only important criteria.</p><br/><p>Soon, it was time for Qin Guan's second scene. Cramming an actor's scenes together in a large-scale TV series could save both time and money. It did set higher standards for the actor though. As soon as Qin Guan changed into his second costume, an assistant walked him to the set.</p><br/><p>This time, he would be standing at the foot of the palace wall.</p><br/><p>As he was about to enter the palace in a cart, he saw his nephew and 10th son of the emperor, Zhir, preparing to jump off from the 10-meter wall with a kite tied to his body.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing a large cloak, a robe and a tall crown that made him look like an immortal. He had no time to maintain his elegant posture though. He jumped down from the cart right away, took off his cloak, and asked his servants to spread it for the falling kid. Then he rushed over to the wall.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his long legs, the man climbed up the wall quickly. The cameraman's job was way harder though. By the time he got to the wall, Qin Guan had already caught the kid and began to spank his butt angrily.</p><br/><p>He had nearly forgotten that the kid was the emperor's son. He had just thought of him as his closest relative.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? You silly boy!\" The child cried out.</p><br/><p>\"Cut! Next scene!\"</p><br/><p>The director led the crew away, leaving Qin Guan sitting on the wall with a crying child in his arms.</p><br/><p>\"Hey? Can someone take him away?\"</p><br/><p>\"You made him cry! He's your responsibility!\"</p><br/><p>F*ck! Where are his parents?</p><br/><p>The kid asked Qin Guan repeatedly if his uncle would buy him cotton candy later. Then he let Qin Guan go with tears on his face. His guardian took him away with an awkward smile.</p><br/><p>\"Deal! I want cotton candy. If you don't get me some, I'll start crying.\"</p><br/><p>His threat was successful.</p><br/><p>When the boy calmed down, the director began shooting the third scene. Qin Guan took his nephew directly to his elder sister's palace.</p><br/><p>He wanted to remind his sister about the danger in the palace, as well as inform her about the trends of the imperial court. He was her eyes outside the palace, watching for any signs of disturbance or trouble.</p><br/><p>The woman had been born in the countryside, but she was smart and capable. As he heard the childish words of his nephew, Qin Guan smiled for the first time in the entire show.</p><br/><p>The director secretly filmed a reaction shot of him. </p><br/><p>He was leaning against the gate calmly, his smile warm and bright with the acceptance of his family and his love for children. He looked really handsome when he smiled.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this was a serious historical show, not a personal story that stressed on appearances, so the director had to stop there.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a seat and explained to his sister the national policy regarding princes in different areas and reminded her to be careful in the palace.</p><br/><p>A woman in a palace had no idea about the big events taking place in the court. Concubine Wang was really close to the emperor, but she had entrusted her brother with the task of getting information, so Qin Guan tried his best to explain to her all the plots and ideas circulating around. People thought that he was quite a smart guy. He was clever, cunning and opportunistic. He was loyal to no one, except his own family.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

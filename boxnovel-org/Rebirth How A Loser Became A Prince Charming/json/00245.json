It comes with the room. Just enjoy it!\"</p><br/><p>Then she smiled at the other guys and picked up a novel with an attractive cover from the shelf. Lying on the couch, she got absorbed in reading.</p><br/><p>Not long after, a scream of agony came from the room. \"It hurts! Don't press there! Ah!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei looked up, smiling in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Then she turned to the next page. The oil massage was relaxing, but it hurt. Cong Nianwei had withstood that pain for 40 minutes, gritting her teeth to hold back her shouts. Of course she would suggest a massage to her boyfriend.</p><br/><p>They left the club late at night. Both He Ming and Guan Jian had enjoyed their time at the quiet club.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan handed them two VIP cards, making a short introduction. They could experience the cards\u2019 benefits gradually in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't show them the secret rooms while Cong Nianwei was there.</p><br/><p>They started their cars and left one by one. Destiny had tied them together. Sighing with emotion, Qin Guan told Cong Nianwei, \"It's getting cold. I\u2019ll take you back to college.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei took Qin Guan\u2019s bag with a smile. \"Okay.\"</p><br/><p>He started the car and put on a slow blues song. Then he said tentatively, \"Cong Nianwei?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\" She turned her head around.</p><br/><p>Looking steadily forward, Qin Guan said, \"Shall we live outside campus in the US? I could ask John to find an apartment for us.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei blinked and turned her head to watch the scenery outside. \"Okay!\" she answered without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan clenched the steering wheel harder. \"No, I mean... Live together\u2026 You and...\" he said nervously.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t continue.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei didn\u2019t turn around. Her back turned to Qin Guan, she answered calmly, \"I know what you mean. How long will we know each other by then? I would like to.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt like he had lost his voice. Only his rapid breathing could be heard inside the carriage. Cong Nianwei\u2019s fairy-like face was visible in the window. Judging by the reflection, she had to be blushing.</p><br/><p>They were growing up gradually. Some emotions would dissipate in time, while others would mature like the purest, richest wine.</p><br/><p>Different people had different definitions of love. That was as natural as the air and water.</p><br/><p>Under the QH dormitory building, a boy was seen shouting inside his car, waving his fists in the air, \"YES! YES!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>He Qian thought this was her lucky day. Her idol had called her back!</p><br/><p>She was busy putting on makeup at her desk. The fierce, tough girl was experiencing nervousness for the first time in her life.</p><br/><p>Her assistant knocked on the door, informing her that Mr. Qin had arrived. He Qian looked up and pushed all her makeup tools into a drawer.</p><br/><p>She smoothed her curly brown hair unconsciously and coughed. \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Her assistant was familiar with her behavior. Trying to cover up his smile, he led Qin Guan inside.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered the office and saw the girl watching him seriously. \"Thank you. Close the door for me, please,\" she told her assistant.</p><br/><p>When he left, they looked at each other for more than ten seconds. Finally, He covered her face. \"Oh, my god! You really called me back! What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn\u2019t help but smile. He handed He Qian all the documents.</p><br/><p>\"Something is the matter. Just look at these first.\"</p><br/><p>Confused, He Qian took the documents and began reading.</p><br/><p>She was getting more and more surprised as she progressed. Several days ago, her manager had brought her the bidding applications. She had read the paperwork, but hadn\u2019't paid much attention to it. She engaged in importing tools, not in domestic development programs.</p><br/><p>She was surprised to see that Qin Guan\u2019s prices were lower than her manager\u2019s by 10%.</p><br/><p>\"Do your friends want to bid on this project? The profit would be too small if they won.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

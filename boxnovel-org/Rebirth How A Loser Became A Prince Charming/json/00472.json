The staff opened them one by one. After getting approved and verified, they would be filed.</p><br/><p>The association had the largest actor database in the US and played an important role among film firms, investors and producers.</p><br/><p>Films of all kinds and classes could find the right actors in the database, to which the resume-collecting staff contributed a lot.</p><br/><p>Female staff had an advantage at work, as the requirements were cautiousness and tolerance when handling complicated paperwork. There were five women working in that section amid a harmonious, relaxed atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\"Work is coming...\"</p><br/><p>Bang! A strong black woman set a large box down on the desk. \"Come on, sweethearts!\"</p><br/><p>The other women gathered around and took the papers away.</p><br/><p>Most of them were junior applications. They would just register them in the system for the other departments to sort them out.</p><br/><p>Some of them just updated older profiles, like Qin Guan's. Actors would renew their data when they got an important role in a film with a big budget, showed up in a famous TV program, or won an award in a competition.</p><br/><p>Those were all reasons for an update. The staff just registered in the system according to the regulations.</p><br/><p>\"Name... Qin Guan... Registered or not... Yes. Wow! Another update. Good for him!\"</p><br/><p>Some actors stumbled upon a chance by luck, but their value still increased in the circle.</p><br/><p>There were hundreds of thousands of actors registered in the association, plus some who did not qualify. Among all those actors, only few could become famous.</p><br/><p>Martha's colleagues gathered around her curiously.</p><br/><p>\"Who is he? Let's have a look. Maybe he is our idol...\"</p><br/><p>\"Here he is!\" Martha opened Qin Guan's original documents in the system.</p><br/><p>His photos were displayed on the screen. The Asian actor was really handsome.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! It's him! I know him. He was the victim of fake news.\"</p><br/><p>\"He was the Best Actor Award winner at Cannes!\"</p><br/><p>That explained why he wanted to update his resume. His value would increase greatly thanks to the award.</p><br/><p>After reading his resume, the ladies fell silent.</p><br/><p>\"He must be very talented. It\u2019s a pity that...\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s a pity that he is Asian. He doesn\u2019t have any experience in American commercial films.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. I watched his film. He\u2019s got good acting skills. An indie film though... The box office was average.\"</p><br/><p>They exchanged a glance and then returned to their seats gloomily. The pile of paperwork before them seemed boring now.</p><br/><p>Martha updated Qin Guan\u2019s resume calmly and found his original documents in a case.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Martha!\" Another girl, who was interested in Qin Guan, called out.</p><br/><p>\"What class of film could he get according to industry standards?\"</p><br/><p>Martha didn't reply. She just typed on the keyboard. Two minutes later, she said, \"C level.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Impossible! That's too low for him.\" The ladies were aggrieved. Qin Guan was well-known by then.</p><br/><p>\"That's true.\" Martha was still busy with work. \"The actor association relies on popularity and achievements. He\u2019s only made one film. All his work was in China, so he is still at D level. He might have won the Best Actor award, but he has never acted in an A level film. Besides, he has never been a leading actor in an indie or commercial film, or gotten considerable box office success. It's natural for him to be classified at C level.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hollywood and America are commerce-oriented. Plus, his skin color explains that classification.\"</p><br/><p>Her response was reasonable. The other girls fell silent. Only the clicks of their keyboards were heard in the room.</p><br/><p>Martha sighed again. She put a \"C\" on the paperwork and filed it.</p><br/><p>\"The most famous Asian actors in Hollywood are Chinese. Chow Yun Fat is no more than B level now. If he fails in a B level film, he will drop another level.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

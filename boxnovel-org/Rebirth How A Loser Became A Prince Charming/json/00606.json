There were dozens of girls in the trunk. They were all wearing bikinis that revealed their smooth skin and energetic limbs and holding large paper boards and small buckets.</p><br/><p>They were standing in two rows with a brave expression on their faces.</p><br/><p>\"Fight for the animals!\" the redhead roared, as if a battle horn had been blown. Her voice echoed around the small square.</p><br/><p>Giorgio Armani caught hold of Qin Guan's sleeve.</p><br/><p>\"Things will get dangerous! Run!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea what was going on, but following their seniors' orders was a natural instinct for Chinese people.</p><br/><p>\"What's happening?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan supported Armani as he shot a look at Sister Xue's sneakers. Smart woman!</p><br/><p>\"They are protesters from an animal protection organization. Every year they show up here for the fur exhibitions. Someone must have leaked some internal information about Gucci's press conference. They seem well-prepared. Just look at all these props and uniforms!\"</p><br/><p>\"We have to get away before they notice us. If we are spotted here, the reporters will be over the moon. Those conceited, self-righteous men will start cursing your ancestors!\"</p><br/><p>It was certainly an unexpected calamity.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue grimaced as she walked along the wall with them. \"There are only a few of them. We have security personnel here. This is pointless. They just want to become famous!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they heard screams around them. The girls were throwing animal blood at the crowd. The buckets of blood smelled like urine.</p><br/><p>Some unlucky women got wet.</p><br/><p>The photographers looked mad with joy as they recorded the disaster with their cameras. Sister Xue shivered in the warm autumn day.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go quickly!\"</p><br/><p>They had no time to look around them. They just followed Armani across the street, the small group standing out among the crowd. The fashion godfather always stood out among ordinary people, and so did Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Look! Who are they?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan! Is he the mastermind behind this?\"</p><br/><p>You've made a big mistake! Animals might not like me, but I've never hurt them!</p><br/><p>\"Go, girls! Give them a lesson!\"</p><br/><p>Before the security guards could arrive, the girls turned spontaneously in a different direction.</p><br/><p>\"Run!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly became the girls' new target. He could actually take advantage of his long legs and escape, but if he did that, Armani would get caught by those crazy girls. If someone hit him on the head with a board, Qin Guan would be considered a sinner in the fashion circle.</p><br/><p>Feeling inspired, Qin Guan rushed over to Armani and crouched before him.</p><br/><p>\"Hold on to me! Let's go!\"</p><br/><p>Before Armani could come back to his senses, he was already on Qin Guan's back, the two of them walking away fast.</p><br/><p>\"Look! What a perfect picture!\"</p><br/><p>\"Did you take one?\"</p><br/><p>The reporters were attracted by the sight of the top model carrying the designer on his back as he ran.</p><br/><p>\"I took one!\"</p><br/><p>\"Let me see!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's f*cking perfect! You could participate in the international figure photography exhibition!\"</p><br/><p>\"You did it, bro!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was shocked. Did those two abandon us?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Track Meeting attracted professional athletes and fans from all over the world. Sports stars shone like real stars over the sky. Before the opening ceremony could even begin, the news about the meeting had already spread.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was just an ordinary passenger, so his skin color helped him go through the airport unnoticed. It was black people that attracted the most attention.</p><br/><p>Up until that point, Liu Xiang had only been famous in China. This was one of his first international achievements.</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoxiao, who had arrived in Lausanne early, met Qin Guan at the airport. Surprisingly, there was no crowd waiting for Qin Guan there. Qin Guan's team walked up to Xu while he was looking in the distance.</p><br/><p>Wang Liying was already impatient due to the change in Qin Guan's schedule. This long trip would affect the actor a lot, so she didn't think very highly of the third generation of Chinese Freemasons in New York Chinatown. Of course, if she knew about Xu's background, she would have tried her best to prevent Qin Guan from communicating with the guy at all.</p><br/><p>The girl tried to use her power anyway. \"You must be Boss Xu, my boss' best friend. Thank you so much for your hospitality. You have covered the expenses of our entire team, which we really appreciate.\"</p><br/><p>Han Zhujiu looked shocked behind Qin Guan. What? Xu paid for the trip? I knew nothing about this.</p><br/><p>He held his questions back when he saw everyone nod along with Wang though. I'm a bodyguard, so I only care about getting my money. I don't give a damn about who pays me.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Xu Xiaoxiao didn't mind about Wang's warm greeting. Qin Guan, who was a careless guy, felt confident about his agent. Meanwhile, Xu was totally fascinated by the lovely girl.</p><br/><p>The long-lost friends didn't notice the trap. They checked in happily and went to Liu Xiang's race the next day.</p><br/><p>The stadium was already crowded because of the grand sports event. Thanks to Xu's influence, they had gotten good seats by the side of the track. This way, they could watch the whole process from the starting point right up to the last sprint.</p><br/><p>It was a sunny day, so everything was going well for both the audience and the athletes. Qin Guan and Xu ignored the buzz of the reporters around them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing an ordinary baseball cap, a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt. He was sitting among thousands of ordinary people, watching the athletes get ready for the race. Everyone was concentrated on the red track under the bleachers. Athletes from all over the world were warming up down there.</p><br/><p>The cameras scanned them one after the other. Thanks to the large screen above the stadium, even the audience farther away could see all the athletes clearly.</p><br/><p>The commentator was reading out loud information about the athletes, including their personal best score, their best season score and their scores during the first and second round of the meeting.</p><br/><p>Athlete No. 239, who was on the first track, was American Ryan Wilson. Liu Xiang from China was on the second track.</p><br/><p>When the commentator got to Liu Xiang's name, Xu Xiaoxiao stood up to cheer for his favorite athlete.</p><br/><p>Even though he was a third-generation American-Chinese immigrant, he hailed for people with the same blood as him. As his friend, Qin Guan felt touched. He was a real Chinese man as well though, so he decided to help him.</p><br/><p>The two of them stood up and started waving the Five-Star Red Flag fiercely on the stands. There were not many Chinese people in the stadium, with the exception of Chinese reporters and sports teams, so they attracted a lot of attention. The cameras recorded the moment and projected it on the large screen.</p><br/><p>The team doctor was stunned. Some young audience members from Germany, France and Italy opened their mouths wide.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's him!\"</p><br/><p>The team doctor rushed up to the director of the sports team.</p><br/><p>\"I saw a celebrity on the screen. Qin Guan has come here to see Liu Xiang!\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>The team director was so focused on his job that he never even went to the cinema. That name meant nothing to him. The team doctor told him a few things about Qin Guan as fast as he could.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That's why they contacted you again.\"</p><br/><p>Wang was right. Qin Guan's fortune had shocked a lot of people. Ordinary people felt confident about their future now thanks to Qin Guan's success after all his struggles. His story was so encouraging! That was why the general director felt like the gala was lacking something.</p><br/><p>\"Will Qin Guan be participating in the gala?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why? Didn't you ask him to?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, but he turned down the opportunity due to his tight schedule. I think he'll be spending the holiday with his family.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's what happened last year!\" Director Lang Kun stuffed a videotape into the camera. It was a recording of the Lantern Festival party in Y city.</p><br/><p>The assistant director was stupefied. \"Is that Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Director Lang Kun nodded. \"That's why I asked about him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Actually, that's beside the point. Some people are very interested in Forbes. He is the only person included in both lists, and this is the most important gala of our entire nation. As a rising star, he should do his bit to help the cultural industry.\"</p><br/><p>\"I received three calls concerning Qin Guan today. The people have spoken. Some of them are really curious.\"</p><br/><p>The assistant director smiled meaningfully at Lang Kun and patted his shoulder without a word.</p><br/><p>The title \"general director\" might sound powerful, but it was Lang Kun that was under the most pressure. He had to coordinate everything and convince everyone. The gala would turn into a disaster if he made even the smallest mistake.</p><br/><p>Plus, the audience was getting pickier and pickier. The gala was a tradition that had to be continued though, so all the responsibility lay on Lang Kun's shoulders. He felt like a camel struggling in the desert. Thankfully, the assistant director decided to help him strengthen his relationship with the actors.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan and Wang Liying could figure out a way to deal with this, Qin Guan's assistant received a call.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan answered it helplessly. The steady voice of a middle-aged man was heard through the phone. The assistant director was good at negotiating. A good voice was all one needed for an emotional conversation late at night.</p><br/><p>His voice, which made people feel close to him, eased Qin Guan's worry.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Qin Guan. I'm the assistant director of CCTV. My last name is Tan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, hello.\"</p><br/><p>\"We are putting together a program that will show the unity of the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. It will follow the singing and dancing performance at the very beginning. We are currently selecting the singers. We plan on choosing an influential actor from each area. I was wondering if you would be interested in representing the mainland.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know that few domestic directors work during the Spring Festival, and you just returned from France and will be staying at home for a while. I hope that you will accept our invitation and spend the festival with us. Of course, directors from the Ministry of Culture, the SARFT and different TV stations will be attending the party. This will be a good chance for you to increase your popularity...\"</p><br/><p>The guy was very good at propaganda. He was like an iron hand in a velvet glove. Qin Guan relaxed at his words.</p><br/><p>He had turned down the gala because it was too much trouble. If he participated, he would have to decide on a performance, rehearse and compete against other actors from all over the country in the CCTV Hall. The whole process would take at least two months.</p><br/><p>If he was lucky enough to get to the next round, he still wouldn't be able to rest. Every second of the gala mattered. If they ran out of time, the performances would be cancelled immediately.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

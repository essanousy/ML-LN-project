She was like a bloody rose, bright but dangerous.</p><br/><p>\"Boss Wang seems to have made his final decision. I\u2019ll get back to work. I have no time to waste.\"</p><br/><p>She walked out of the office, swaying on her red heels. Wang glanced at her butt and shivered, swallowing his saliva.</p><br/><p>Lily looked at Wang pathetically. She smiled in relief when he stretched his hand out towards her.</p><br/><p>They hugged, acting as if no one else was present. Qin Guan coughed awkwardly. \"Brother Wang, is there anything else? I have to go.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang was too busy to pay attention. He gestured and everyone disappeared on the spot.</p><br/><p>On the third floor, Mou Xiaoliu was waiting awkwardly to apologize to Qin Guan. Qin Guan just smiled gently and warned her, \"Don\u2019t meddle here. Remember, you work here only for the money! Beware of people who want to use you.\"</p><br/><p>Mou nodded tamely and disappeared at the end of the corridor.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn\u2019t speak until she left. \"Come out!\" he told Wenwen, who was standing around the corner, before putting his hands in his pockets.</p><br/><p>Wenwen smiled gently as she walked up to him. \"You are one of the few clever guys in this company. So is Brother Bu.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at her doubtfully. \"That was so anticlimactic! That\u2019s not your style. What are you planning?\"</p><br/><p>\"Men are always fooled by women's tears. The truth was right before his eyes, yet he was still deceiving himself. I won\u2019t waste any more words on him. Tomorrow I\u2019ll bring evidence. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the little lamb will say.\"</p><br/><p>\"What did you do, sister?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's none of your business. I originally wanted to use you to uncover the truth. You are the most reliable person in their minds after all. It\u2019s a pity that you escaped. If you are not helping though, then you don't need to know anything.\" She walked to the bar without looking back.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Is it even worth it for such a man?\" She had disappeared before his voice had even faded away.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his room in a bad mood. Even the two goals the Chinese team scored couldn't arouse his interest. An end should be put to that accident. Good luck to them all!</p><br/><p>Murphy's Law had worked.</p><br/><p>On the first day of his senior year, Qin Guan received an angry call from Bu.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Something has happened! Don\u2019t ask questions! Just come over immediately!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hung up right away and drove to the club. What on earth happened? Did my presentiment come true?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan parked and locked his car before climbing up the fire ladder to the office in a hurry.</p><br/><p>The three steel safes on the wall seemed to be laughing at the stupid guys in the room. They were empty except for some useless invoices and contracts.</p><br/><p>\"How much was taken?\" Qin Guan asked directly.</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu looked up at him. \"Several million. It was payment day today.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are there any savings in your accounts?\"</p><br/><p>\"We repaid our debt.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan covered his face helplessly. \"I have told you countless times to deposit the money! Now it\u2019s all gone!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang\u2019s blue veins heaved on his forehead. He jumped up and shouted, \"That b*tch! She took my money! I\u2019ll catch her though!\"</p><br/><p>Bu sighed and tried to comfort him, \"I\u2019ve sent men after her. She won't escape. The most important thing is for us to deal with the matter at hand. I have to pinch and scrape and calculate in every way. Our brothers who got paid back thought we were bankrupt. Now I need another million for the employees\u2019 salaries.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed in relief at the sum. \"I could lend that amount to you for your immediate needs. I made a small fortune not long ago. It\u2019s for my studies abroad, so I\u2019m not using it at present.\"</p><br/><p>Bu hugged Qin Guan and patted him on the back. \"My good brother. I live on XX, XXX Road in the Haidian District. I\u2019ll return the sum to you in two months.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan struggled out of his embrace and grinned. \"I don't need your money. Just add me to the shareholders of the company. It could be considered an investment. Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>\"You beat me! I had been planning on pulling you onto our boat anyway. As you like to say, no pain, no gain. Now that you\u2019re rich, you\u2019ve gotten greedy, huh?\" Bu Qinglu relaxed and teased Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>It was better to have him join in. He and Wang were unrestrained men, so it was worth it to have Qin Guan join them with such a small share.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan went abroad, they could contact each other through email.</p><br/><p>Wang didn't look happy about the good news. He was still lying on the couch just like he had been when Qin Guan had entered the room.</p><br/><p>They heard some steps up the stairs. Wenwen was standing at the door in a close-fitting black dress.</p><br/><p>Wang\u2019s lifeless eyes flashed. \"Wen... Wenwen, why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>Wenwen sneered coldly and threw a mini recording pen at his bare head. \"No reason. I wanted to show you evidence of your sweetheart\u2019s affair, but it seems unnecessary now!\"</p><br/><p>She was about to turn around and leave, when Wang pulled her back from behind.</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu and Qin Guan closed their mouths awkwardly. There must be a story here. We\u2019d better leave.</p><br/><p>The door was closed. Wenwen's voice could be heard indistinctly from inside, half-grumbling and half-struggling. \"What are you doing? Do you know who really cares about you? Yes, yes...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

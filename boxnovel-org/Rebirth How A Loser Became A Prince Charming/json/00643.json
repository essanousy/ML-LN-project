The donation box is over there. I'll be waiting for you here. Let's do this! For the starving kids of the world!\"</p><br/><p>He over-emphasized the fact that the stock would be sold out soon. What a cunning young man!</p><br/><p>People lined up again, the customers leaving with the fruit of Qin Guan's labor. This was their lucky day. They had met a handsome guy and bought candy!</p><br/><p>In the end, there were only crumbs left on the plates, which indicated that the charity bazaar had been a success. The unsatisfied residents turned their eyes to the stage, where a small-scale auction was taking place.</p><br/><p>The auctioned items included an almost-new toaster, a child's tricycle, a professional tool kit and some high-end dresses.</p><br/><p>As a participant, Qin Guan had brought his own item. It was a second-hand Citizen wrist watch worth about 50 dollars. He was only asking for 40 dollars for it.</p><br/><p>The items were sold out one after the other. Qin Guan wasn't aware of the real value of the watch until the host showed it to the audience.</p><br/><p>\"This item was donated by our distinguished guest, Mr. Qin Guan! He wore it between 2001 and 2002, when he had just moved to America. At the time, he had still been a nobody travelling around the city with this watch as he looked for a job. He is a Citizen ambassador in Asia, so this is quite a meaningful watch. The starting price is 40 dollars! It's a reasonable price for such excellent quality! The watch was made in Japan!\"</p><br/><p>\"So...\" He banged his hammer against the table. \"Let's begin!\"</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished his introduction, offers started coming one after the other.</p><br/><p>\"50 dollars!\"</p><br/><p>\"100!\"</p><br/><p>\"150!\"</p><br/><p>\"300!\"</p><br/><p>The last offer attracted everyone's attention. It was Qu Xuemei, who was still a fierce, determined woman.</p><br/><p>Xu craned his neck around a pile of boxes. \"Is your agent that rich?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. She is the chief editor of VOGUE.\"</p><br/><p>Qu bought the watch for 400 dollars.</p><br/><p>Xu made a sound of admiration. \"Before you graduate and return to China, could you please leave me all your second-hand belongings?\"</p><br/><p>Bills mounted in the donation box, while the goods were gradually sold out. The excitement faded away as the residents focused on Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The host, who was a funny old man, stopped everything for the activity and slowly held up the microphone.</p><br/><p>\"Today, we are here to welcome a new friend. He is the owner of 'Beauty of the World', a J Clothing ambassador and a two-time Best Actor Award winner in Europe. It's a handsome young man named Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Applause echoed around the lawn.</p><br/><p>\"This is a rare opportunity for us to meet him. Would you like to see him in an impromptu meeting at the end of this successful event?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's great!\"</p><br/><p>The unexpected proposal surprised Qin Guan and his team. This would be the highlight of their public-interest campaign. The director, who was very ambitious about his work, would turn the film into a documentary. Maybe it would even win an award...</p><br/><p>Both parties were waiting for Qin Guan with delight. He looked at the small stage, which was not enough for any wild movements, and told Lan Jin, \"Bring me a Xun, please.\"</p><br/><p>Lan Jin ran to the gallery fast, while Qin Guan walked on the stage slowly. The stage was two meters long and one meter wide. If I dance on it, it will collapse.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lan Jin came back with a Xun and handed it to Qin Guan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

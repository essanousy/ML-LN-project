Columbia was the Alma Mater of two American presidents, so it was a real breeding place for political talent.</p><br/><p>The Chinese Student Union of Columbia also faced the same dilemma. Their last chairman had gotten an offer from CBS TV and taken advantage of it.</p><br/><p>One could imagine the value of the position, as well as the advantages Zhang would gain if he succeeded.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan worked daily, while Zhang was nervously trying his best.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of his position, he drove out the car of the union and got the sackbut and microphone ready. He had also printed posters and leaflets about himself, with the title \"Cherish Constant, Steady Development\".</p><br/><p>Standing on the busiest path of the campus, Zhang shouted at the students through his loudspeaker. Posters had also been pasted on all corridors in the buildings. On them, Zhang was smiling warmly at everyone in his school uniform, holding his books in his hands.</p><br/><p>His assistants would hand out a leaflet to every student with an Asian face. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were idling around on campus, when they saw the scene. Zhang, who disliked Qin Guan, shouted at him through the microphone.</p><br/><p>\"Give me your vote, handsome boy! As a member of the union, I\u2019ll do my best to help everyone. You must agree with my opinion and support our work.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know you seldom participate in after-class campus activities, but I would like to hear your ideas.\"</p><br/><p>Are you kidding? You run for chairman and let me mind my own business. We live in different worlds.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei took a leaflet and left, feeling both confused and gloomy. Xu Xiaoxiao, who had also witnessed the whole thing, got angry.</p><br/><p>Are you challenging Qin Guan? I know he has no interest in the election because of his tight schedule, but I\u2019ll help him! I don't want to see your disgusting face again.</p><br/><p>As Xu was thinking of a plan, Rongzhi got scared by the loudspeaker. His miniature flying robot nearly fell down on his head.</p><br/><p>Your provocations are tasteless. You nearly destroyed my treasure! I\u2019ll get back at you! </p><br/><p>He almost vented his anger on Zhang.</p><br/><p>Both Rongzhi and Xu were making plans against Zhang Dekai.</p><br/><p>As an older student at Columbia, Xu was familiar with the routine of the elections. In 10 minutes, he had already made arrangements through his phone.</p><br/><p>When he returned to the classroom, he stretched a hand out to Qin Guan. \"Lend me some money.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused. He was working on his homework.</p><br/><p>\"How much do you want?\" He searched in his pocket.</p><br/><p>\"One thousand dollars for a start...\"</p><br/><p>What? I thought you were asking for change to buy a cup of tea.</p><br/><p>\"I put your name down for the chairman election. Give me some money for the campaign. I\u2019ll be your sponsor. I\u2019ll give you the money back tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p> \"Don't forget, I am your benefactor. You don't need to thank me.\"</p><br/><p> Thank you for what? Did you even ask my opinion?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stared at him. \"I have no time for this. It\u2019s too much trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll do all the work for you. You just need to show up on election day. If you don't accept such favourable terms, I\u2026 I will cry myself to death right here in front of you!\"</p><br/><p>\"What a miserable life!\" Xu cried out.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan covered his face. \"Okay, okay. Just inform me in advance!\"</p><br/><p> He handed Xu his credit card. The matter had been settled.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The next day, the campus was livelier than ever. There were two Chinese girls in cheongsams standing on the road with colorful ribbons, showing their support for Qin Guan. They were distributing leaflets to the passersby.</p><br/><p>On both sides of Zhang Dekai\u2019s campaign car were two small campaign cars with posters of Qin Guan. He was smiling happily at the crowd.</p><br/><p>His image was also on colorful balloons. The photos were clear enough for anyone to count his eyelashes.</p><br/><p>The posters were of the same composition as Zhang\u2019s, except for the fact that they were a little bigger. Compared to a professional model, Zhang looked ugly.</p><br/><p>In half a day, all the Chinese students at Columbia had heard about the legendary candidate. His story could be turned into a novel.</p><br/><p>\"I know him a little. I saw his TV show in China before I came to the US.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. He is also a student at Columbia. People in China said that he was a straight-A student. It\u2019s true!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

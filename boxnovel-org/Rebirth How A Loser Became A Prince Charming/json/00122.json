Look at me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Can I be your girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p>The sharp change of the situation had turned two of Wang Hao's fans into traitors. Qin Guan had turned out to be even more shining and handsome than Wang.</p><br/><p>When they stood still, Qin Guan came over and and pushed Wang Hao to provoke him. The referee glanced at Qin Guan in warning, and he bent his head down and walked away. The situation was very clear.</p><br/><p>The last 10 minutes were Guan's solo show, even though they lost with a small score difference of 48-52.</p><br/><p>It was a team sport, so nobody could defeat five players unless they had superpowers. Maybe in the future Qin Guan would be able to steal the skills of NBA players, but that day on campus he could only sight at the final score.</p><br/><p>It was not too bad though, considering their opponents had used their full force. The Finance Department wanted to weep when they thought of their next powerful opponent. Qin Guan had been the real winner of that game.</p><br/><p>He had won the girls\u2019 hearts and the love of his classmates. He was a guy who seldom engaged in team activities, so that game had increased his popularity. He had blended in with everyone else fast.</p><br/><p>The commentator believed that Qin Guan would be the MVP of the game.</p><br/><p>From that day on, Qin Guan was considered the basketball prince, a living legend for countless young boys who were deeply in love but unable to pursue their passion.</p><br/><p>At dawn, they supported a groggy Liu Xiaoyang and hugged Qin Guan, who was stinky with sweat, before going back to their familiar dormitory. The flying time of youth always left unforgettable marks in one\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>It was time to stop dwelling on emotions and get down to the serious problems of reality though. Qin Guan idled around for several weeks, just chatting with his roommates and sleeping.</p><br/><p>Under the pressure of Shao Xiaobing, Sister Xue couldn't find any good jobs for him. Qin Guan felt extremely embarrassment to be working at a marketplace.</p><br/><p>At least it was crowded there on the weekends, but why did Sister Xue have to choose such a nearby market? It was only a couple of kilometres away from Qin Guan's college. Why did she choose Shuangan Plaza, and not Modern Plaza?</p><br/><p>Modern Plaza? Yes, that\u2019s the place where Qin Guan had treated Cong Nianwei. Now you have an idea about the distance. There was only one road between the two plazas. They could be compared to two friends, except that one of them was frequented by handsome customers, and the other by people in their underpants and waistcoats.</p><br/><p>In 1999, the old Shuangan Plaza was very poor. It might look magnificent now, but people still remember how bad it used to look in the past.</p><br/><p>The woollen sweater wholesale was a favorite of the housewives, plain civilians and students.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan appeared before the audience. There was an underwear show right beside his stage. Thank god Sister Xue hadn't picked that job for him.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan walked out, the hall was already crowded. It was the first time he would be performing before such a big audience.</p><br/><p>T shows were considered fangle at the time. Everyone wanted to see one personally though, as they could usually only be watched on TV.</p><br/><p>As the most important model (he had won a national contest after all), the branding business attached great importance to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The men's casual formalwear MTS sale at the Shuangan Plaza was always mediocre. The boss was not satisfied with the situation, so he had organized that show to promote sales.</p><br/><p>His assistant had arranged an unexpected surprise for him. He had booked a national new model contest winner. The level of the show was elevated at once.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan enjoyed the treatment of a superstar in the temporarily constructed chamber.</p><br/><p>\"Have some water, please.\" A bottle of mineral water was handed to him.</p><br/><p>\"The show will begin soon. Don't drink too much.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sit down, please!\"</p><br/><p>There was little room backstage and there were other modes were standing there, waiting for the opening. Qin Guan shook his head. \"There\u2019s not point. The show will begin in a few minutes.\"</p><br/><p>The assistant was shocked by his humbleness.</p><br/><p>By then, the host had began his introduction. The underwear models got on the stage first.</p><br/><p>An old woman fixed her eyes on the models with a hateful expression. \"They corrupt public morals! The police should arrest them! That girl is showing her bare legs!\"</p><br/><p>Why are you watching the show and commenting so enthusiastically then?</p><br/><p>The prospects of MTS looked dim. The audience wouldn't be interested in models wearing clothes after appreciating the ones without clothes.</p><br/><p>The boss looked at Sister Xue pitifully. After talking shortly, they decided to assign Qin Guan one more job.</p><br/><p>He would have to get on the stage twice. The first and last appearance would both be his, but he would have to take his coat off during the opening show.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t realize their intention until he took it off. The shirt was fitting, smooth and a little bit short. His V-line abs were partly hidden and partly visible under it.</p><br/><p>It was a sexy seduction. This was foul play! Qin Guan saw Sister Xue show him three fingers and turn her hand. He understood instantly and did as he was told.</p><br/><p>(Ha, ha, ha! Did you you get it? He was getting paid triple!)</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took off his coat and tore the collar open to show off his elegant collarbone. When the underwear models got off the stage and the host began to introduce the formalwear show, the audience lost their interest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

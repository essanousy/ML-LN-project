When he reached the stand, Qin Guan found Zhou Jing carrying packages up and down, acting as a cooley for his aunt.</p><br/><p>The packages were carried out of warehouse and taken away by retail merchants. Zhou Jing's aunt looked busy as she shouted to Qin Guan, \"Have a seat, Qin Guan! Was it hot on the way? Shall I buy you an ice-cream?\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing wanted to cry, but he couldn't shed a tear. \"You are my born aunt. Why do you treat others better than me?\"</p><br/><p>His aunt glanced at him in dislike before she turned to Qin Guan enthusiastically, \"What's the matter, Qin Guan? Zhou Jing is too stupid to explain the situation.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at her. \"Aunt, Zhou Jing, Li Jian and I have a stand on the first swimming beach. We want to sell swimsuits and rent swimming rings. I know that you have a flourishing business in the market, so I came here to ask you for ideas.\"</p><br/><p>The woman smiled, and wrinkles formed on her face at his praise. Zhou Jing murmured beside her, \"It\u2019s only a small stand. Barely six square metres...\"</p><br/><p>\"Bang!\" Before he could finish his words, his aunt had hit him over the head. \"And you blamed me for prejudice! Hear what you just said! You are my born nephew!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan continued in a hush, \"Don't listen to him, aunt. I just want to know if we could pay you after making sales. You know we are only college students.\"</p><br/><p>The aunt smiled and covered her mouth. \"That\u2019s fine. Summer is close, and I'm selling lots of swimsuits. Your requirement is not unreasonable. You can choose any style or size you like. I\u2019ll only charge you for the purchasing cost. The sales volume will depend on you.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan immediately answered with a sweet smile, \"Thank you so much, my aunt! You take care of your own business. Don't worry about us. We\u2019ll select ourselves.\"</p><br/><p>The aunt nodded and pointed at the goods on the shelves. \"Okay, I\u2019ll leave you alone. You can put them in a bag. Just tell me the type and amount when you're done.\"</p><br/><p>They both nodded. One of them held the bag while the other selected the swimsuits.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed at the swimsuit styles as he approached the shelves. They were all really conservative. The most fashionable one was a half-skirt suit that left the waist bare.</p><br/><p>To make a long story short, Qin Guan selected ten male one-size swimming trunks, five of which were three-cornered. The others were all boxers shorts.</p><br/><p>Then he selected ten one-size trunks for boys and ten swimsuits for girls between the ages of six and ten, which were all lovely seersuckers and colourful one-pieces.</p><br/><p>Seersucker swimsuits were the most popular style of the time, and they were famous for their small, bubble-like wrinkles. Nowadays, they would have been considered rustic, but they were the most fashionable swimsuit at the time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan selected ten one-piece swimsuits for ladies and two bikinis that left their navels exposed. He was afraid that the bikinis wouldn't be accepted by the conservative residents of Y city.</p><br/><p>That was enough for the first day. After all, most of the tourists would bring their own swimsuits. Qin Guan's sales would depend solely on his taste.</p><br/><p>They recorded the sizes and amount of the selected swimsuits and put them all in a bag. Then they bid farewell to Zhou Jing's aunt and left for the culture and sport equipment wholesale market. There was a stand selling swimming rings in a corner.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan asked the vendor only for thick rings made of rubber, as well as tedious red ones for kids. Zhou Jing pointed at the colourful rings made of thin plastic and asked him in confusion, \"Those look prettier. Why didn't you choose them?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at him speechlessly. \"I have nothing to say to you. Your IQ has hit rock bottom. Who would use rings made of such materials? Didn't you notice that I chose the rings with the best durability? We also have to check for leaks. There are waves and wind in the sea, it's not like a pool. A sharp stone could break your ring, and a big wave could take you and your ring away. The most essential factor in choosing a ring is the safety of a person who can\u2019t swim. Mind your IQ, please.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jing touched his head in shame. As a local person who had been swimming in the sea ever since he was a kid, he really had no idea about swimming rings.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan chose three black rubber rings and two red rings for kids. The bright color would make the ring stand out when it floated in the sea. If a kid was in danger and asked for help, the adults in the area would find it easily.</p><br/><p>He also remembered to buy a mini inflater before they left. The two of them were uncomfortable as they went out of the market.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had three rings on his body, while Zhou Jing carried two rings and all the swimsuits.</p><br/><p>Nothing can be done. Let's go home first.</p><br/><p>When they returned home, Qin Guan was still busy. He transferred all the frozen seafood left from the Spring Festival from the small ice tank to the freezing chamber of the fridge. The ice tank, which was now empty, would be used to hold the cool drinks Li Jian would bring back. Qin Guan found a nylon rope and tied the five rings together so they would be easier to carry.</p><br/><p>What they needed now was only umbrellas and a shelf, which had to be made by professionals. Qin Guan called his elder cousin to describe the type of shelf on which they would hang the swimsuits. Actually, it was an iron gauze on square shelves.</p><br/><p>The work was simple, and his cousin answered without any hesitation. He had been afraid that Qin Guan might be his competitor in the kebab business. It was currently peak season for the night market.</p><br/><p>When the shelf was finished, Qin Guan sent Zhou Jing to his father's unit in the Bureau of Retired Veteran Cadres. It was rumored that the retired cadres had held a sports meeting and had more than ten large umbrellas left. Although the title of the bureau was printed on them, they were still good for providing shade. Zhou Jing borrowed them for re-usage, which was redevelopment of effective resources.</p><br/><p>While Zhou Jing was gone, Qin Guan took an Changsheng ice cube with a rich milk flavour, lay down on the couch joyfully and turned on the TV.</p><br/><p>A rerun of a series called \"Youth, Start Off\" was on. An actress named Fan Pingping was the leading star. Qin Guan spit the ice cube out.</p><br/><p>What the hell is this series even about? On the screen, Fan Pingping had baby fat and short hair, which reminded Qin Guan of his past life.</p><br/><p>They had been in the same senior high school and the same grade. It was a pity that in his past life, Qin Guan had been a loser. He had been one of those boys who just drooled over the girls of their dreams.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

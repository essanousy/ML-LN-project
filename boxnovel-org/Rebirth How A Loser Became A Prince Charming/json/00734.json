His eyes were fixed on the door of the fitting room.</p><br/><p>Wang came back happily with a plastic bag. That explained why he had not put on the gloves. It would have been inconvenient for him to have breakfast with the gloves on.</p><br/><p>Delicious food was always a priority. Qin Guan craned his neck towards the bag.</p><br/><p>\"What did you get? The breakfast in Tianjin is not as delicate as in Southern China, but it's still delicious!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Liying took the food out of the bag and placed it on the table.</p><br/><p>\"I got you something easy to eat. We have to work later, so I didn't buy anything liquid. There were a lot of people waiting in line before the stand, so it must be good.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Jinglei, who was eating a bun elegantly next to them, seemed curious about the contents of the bag.</p><br/><p>\"Here you are!\"</p><br/><p>\"What's this?\" Qin Guan asked, looking at the large piece of food in his hand.</p><br/><p>\"Jiaoquan in a pancake. It's very popular around here.\"</p><br/><p>I know it's a pancake, but what the hell is inside it? This must weigh about half a kilo...</p><br/><p>Xu burst into laughter and turned around politely to eat her porridge, acting as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>It was hard to turn down such a kind offer, so Qin Guan bit on the pancake nervously.</p><br/><p>The two Juanquans rolled in it were suddenly exposed. Bean sprouts, dried soy beans and red powder had been rolled into a thin sheet of bean curd, along with salt, sesame oil and monosodium glutamate.</p><br/><p>The whole thing had been fried in oil and rolled up, the extra grease soaking the pancakes. The two different nutrients, which were a perfect match, made up the traditional breakfast of the Tianjin people.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fell in love with the food at first bite and unashamedly buried his face into the bag. Different foods required different eating methods. A real foodie knew how to eat delicious food.</p><br/><p>He finished half the roll and swallowed up some soybean milk before looking up at Xu and everyone else.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter, Sister Xu? Aren't your buns tasty? Have some of my food.\"</p><br/><p>He handed Xu a roll, but the sane woman stopped him.</p><br/><p>\"No, thanks. You are very polite, but I'm full. You can have it. I'll go check on the equipment,\" she said before escaping.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stuffed the end of the roll into his mouth. He didn't feel sorry at all. Then he gave Wang Liying a thumbs-up and took a tissue from her. Good girl! You are much better than Princess Xue!</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan went out of the working site, he discovered that Xu had already fixed the equipment. A girl in a white robe was standing next to her in the alley.</p><br/><p>She looked like a student, but her hair was as lovely as a doll's. If it wasn't for the smile on her face, which was as bright as sunshine, Qin Guan would have thought that Yamaguchi Tsutomu had come to China.</p><br/><p> She looked like Xu, except she was much younger than her. She was just 15 years old after all. She was only a greenhand selected among numerous girls.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she saw Qin Guan on the old German motorcycle and grew nervous. The young award-winning actor was her classmates' idol.</p><br/><p>They were all collecting posters and photos of him like crazy, but they were not as lucky as she was. She had gotten a chance to work with him.</p><br/><p> Xu, who understood the girl, didn't try to improve her acting skills. They just needed to cooperate well together.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, please! First scene, the first meeting. Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>A few girls began playing games by the yard gate. They were playing the craziest game of the time: Eagle and Chicks. Laughter filled the alley, when they suddenly heard the owner of a motorcycle speak behind them.</p><br/><p>A tall, charming man passed by them on his motorcycle. He was wearing goggles and he had an evil smile on his face as he pulled over to the yard gate leisurely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

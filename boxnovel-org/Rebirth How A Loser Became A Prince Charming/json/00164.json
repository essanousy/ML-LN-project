It was not overshadowed by the previous or following costumes.</p><br/><p>It was the one the designer had been the most worried about, but Qin Guan made it looks new with his figure. The designer kept Qin Guan in his mind. In the following days, Qin Guan performed in several shows smoothly thanks to John\u2019s help. After nine days, it was finally time for the closing show.</p><br/><p>The night was tender, and the lights were twinkling. Media, businessmen, designers and brand agents from every corner of the world had taken their seats, waiting for the fashion feast to begin.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless before the different groups of models backstage. He handed his luggage to Sister Xue and entered the dressing room first. He was surprised at Cabben's investment in the room.</p><br/><p>All the costumes were hanging in the closets, the correspondent shoes under them. The socks and sleeve buttons were also easily accessible.</p><br/><p>Why are my shoes not in place? Qin Guan took a pair of Oxfords from the shelf.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch! What the hell is that?\" Qin Guan put his fingers inside the shoes and took out a clip used for pinning clothes. He wouldn't have found it if he didn\u2019t make a habit of checking the accessories before changing into his clothes.</p><br/><p>If he\u2019d put his foot in, he would have gotten injured. Qin Guan stared at the blood on his fingertip, falling into deep thought.</p><br/><p>The perpetrator had to be a member of the staff or a model. There were no cameras in the fitting rooms, so it would be hard to find him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went out of the fitting room with the shoes and informed Sister Xue of the incident.</p><br/><p>It was performing time. As a model, his most important task was the show.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put on short pants, a colorful silk shirt, a round-collar leisure suit, and a curled wig for the reminiscence. He looked like a weird, fashionable guy.</p><br/><p>The assistant was listening to Sister Xue's description with a serious expression. He seemed to be getting more and more angry. He had witnessed plenty of secret feuds among models that meant nothing to designers and brands. For them, models were cabbages on shelves in the supermarket. They would pick up the best one and cook it at home.</p><br/><p>When the dish was ready, they would either like it or not. The cabbage had already been used anyway. If they poisoned each other before the cabbage was cooked though, the feast would be destroyed. It would be unbearable for the host of the show!</p><br/><p>In the resting area, the designer told his staff calmly, \"We can\u2019t let this go. Make an inquiry. There must be some clues around.\"</p><br/><p>Then he waved at Qin Guan and patted him on the arm. \"Are you angry? Can you finish the show?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's fine.\"</p><br/><p>\"So what are you waiting for? Go! Go! Go! Put on a good show!\"</p><br/><p>Confused, Qin Guan was pushed towards the entrance. Fireworks exploded in the sky as a dreamy flare burned by the stage. Cabben models with a rare, wild style walked on the stage in a most unrestrained manner.</p><br/><p>The model behind Qin Guan, who was from the Pickle Nation, was watching his light steps. Qin Guan attracted all the attention of the audience and the photographers.</p><br/><p>His eyes twinkled as he unconsciously looked at the guest area of the entertainment circle, where his new Chinese friend Shao Xiaobing was sitting.</p><br/><p>He knew that after the show, his so-called friendship with Shao would be over. Shao\u2019s plan had failed. The small trouble backstage, which usually succeeded, hadn't had any effect on Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Shao would be disappointed with himself and cease any communication with him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan dared not think about that problem. He refused to think about Shao Xiaobing sitting under the stage, staring calmly at him. Qin Guan turned around to return backstage. He looked as hot and bright as a burning torch on the T stage.</p><br/><p>Shao glanced at the model behind Qin Guan with shining eyes before he looked down indifferently.</p><br/><p>I shouldn\u2019t have placed my hopes on the idiot from the Pickle Nation.</p><br/><p>He left silently before the end of the show. No one noticed him, as their attention was on the performance.</p><br/><p>If I get a chance, I\u2019ll still suppress him. His position is almost the same as mine.</p><br/><p>The models clustered around the chief designer of Cabben, whose appearance brought the audience to its feet in applause. The show ended, leaving all the staff and models changing clothes in noisy disorder.</p><br/><p>During the quiet after the show, there was a serious stalemate. Several models from the Pickle Nation and Qin Guan had stayed behind at the office of the designer. They were all looking at each other.</p><br/><p>The designer spoke first. \"Tell me, why?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was curious himself. I know I must have caused public outrage by passing too many auditions, but better models should make more money. It's reasonable. Those kind of tricks are disgusting.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hadn\u2019t thought that they would play such a dirty trick on a local model in a foreign country. They had overestimated their power though. At the beginning, Qin Guan had thought the trick had been a Plaster Flag Nation model\u2019s job. There were too many similar plots in their comics on school bullies. A blade in a shoe sole was a classic prank. (Although he\u2019d only read the comics, that was what real life was like in that country.)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

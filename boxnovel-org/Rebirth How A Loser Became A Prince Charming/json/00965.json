Qin Guan has joined the show!\"</p><br/><p>\"I can see him! This is our first close encounter!\"</p><br/><p>\"The screen is too short for me!\"</p><br/><p>\"He's not wearing any makeup! He is so brave!\"</p><br/><p>\"He's outshining every other star around him!\"</p><br/><p>As more and more people joined the discussion on the show's online forum, more and more people heard the news and turned on their TVs.</p><br/><p>\"It's true! I thought it was fake news!\"</p><br/><p>\"If God gave me a second chance, I wouldn't give the invitation to my friend this time!\"</p><br/><p>\"Regret is useless. We should just enjoy the moment.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone fell silent. If the contestants were aware of the situation, they would have burst into tears.</p><br/><p>We have become mere extras in our own show!</p><br/><p>Everyone on site knew that if any experienced award-winning actors were there, they would also have been lost in the background.</p><br/><p>As Lao Liang finished his interview with Huang Xiaoming, the cameramen fixed their cameras on Qin Guan. In an effort to create more topics of conversation, Lao Liang began to encourage the audience's enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>\"Now, let's get to the next judge. Who is he?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! The most handsome guy in the world!\" everyone shouted together before they started screaming.</p><br/><p>\"As the host, I would like to ask him a question. Qin Guan, if you were 10 years younger, would you participate in our program as a contestant?\"</p><br/><p>Of course not. 10 years ago, Qin Guan had still been a loser.</p><br/><p>He was getting paid for this though, so he couldn't tell the truth.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's smile was like a lightning among dark clouds.</p><br/><p>\"Guess.\"</p><br/><p>This was the most annoying answer in the world. People who answered like this should get beaten.</p><br/><p>Of course, Lao Liang dared not beat Qin Guan. He just had to make up for his bad answer.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is the most popular actor in China, so he wouldn't have needed our show to succeed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"He is right!\"</p><br/><p>Lao Liang didn't know how to continue.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Qin Guan was a considerate man.</p><br/><p>\"No, you are wrong. My fans know how many years I've spent working towards these achievements.\"</p><br/><p>\"Seven years!\"</p><br/><p>\"Just like Huang said, the young men on this stage have only spent three months! In the past, actors had to work a longer time to impress the audience. These are golden times for actors. All they have to do is show their talent.\"</p><br/><p>\"You should appreciate the platform Dragon Television is providing you with. If you make enough effort, you will be in my place someday, witnessing other people rise to fame.\"</p><br/><p>Yes, it was easier for actors to get famous now. The young boys on the stage already had their own fan clubs. When they grew up, their fans would be the pillars of society and their best customers.</p><br/><p>This was a rare chance, but young people were precious.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's short interview ended. The other guests were not from the acting circle. They all came from film companies like Huayi. Wang Zhonglei had become the official representative of Huayi. Qin Guan's recommendation had helped him join the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>In the past, it might have taken one 10 years to become a superstar, but nowadays, four years were enough for an entire new generation to become famous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How dare you lay a finger on my pie!</p><br/><p>\"Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Kim nodded. Although she had been the first offender, her confession had seemed sincere, so the queen cut her some slack.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was sitting on the floor, admiring the two ladies. Suddenly, Qu shouted at him.</p><br/><p>\"Get ready for the next scene! Careful with your shorts!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was relaxed though. My girlfriend is right. I am lucky to have such a strict agent.</p><br/><p>After a fierce stare-down, Kim was defeated. Before leaving for the fitting room, she cast a regretful, sad look at Qin Guan. He couldn't help but shiver.</p><br/><p>Soon, she came back out in black lace underwear, revealing her sexy body.</p><br/><p>\"Get ready, everyone!\" the director shouted.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan lay down on the bed again. The sheets had been changed. He held his arms up and put them on the railings by the bedside. Then a property master locked his hands there with handcuffs.</p><br/><p>\"Actors!\" At the command of the director, Kim climbed on the bed with a seductive smile.</p><br/><p>Qu twisted the newspaper in her hand. I should be getting some sleep at home on the weekends! I deserve it!</p><br/><p>Knowing the power of the Asian woman, Kim dared not play with fire. She kneeled on the bed and nodded at the director.</p><br/><p>\"Final scene! Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>The camera started filming. In a moment, Kim became Samantha. She was playing happily above Qin Guan, giggling and flirting with him. Qin Guan didn\u2019t show his face. It was strange for him to look up at Samantha. He wanted to laugh.</p><br/><p>The two of them were doing physical exercises on the bed. It was not romantic, but it was funny. Suddenly, the door opened.</p><br/><p>Two men came in, both bald and wearing tacky grey coats. They looked like Manhattan policemen.</p><br/><p>Annoyed, Samantha shouted. \"F*ck off! I\u2019m busy!\"</p><br/><p>The director couldn\u2019t help but shiver. Such resentment!</p><br/><p>The men were not scared though. \"FBI. You are arrested for insider trading, Chip.\"</p><br/><p>The camera turned to Qin Guan, who looked at them blankly, both hands still locked on the railings. Although there was a beautiful girl on top of him, he was rendered impotent.</p><br/><p>\"You must be quite the womanizer. Whenever a girl lies in your bed, the Dow Jones index rises.\"</p><br/><p>The FBI agent failed to open the handcuffs. It was embarrassing. He actually had to ask for help from Samantha.</p><br/><p>\"Please unlock them, madam. He has to put ours on.\"</p><br/><p>Samantha did as she was told calmly. \"Good men are always taken by the police.\"</p><br/><p>How many men have been taken from your bed by the police?</p><br/><p>The director zoomed in on Qin Guan, who fully deserved the title of \"Wall Street Playboy\". Despite the circumstances, he cast a flirting look at Samantha.</p><br/><p>The director gave him a thumbs up. The actor was perfect. He was neither pleased by his gains, nor saddened by his personal losses.</p><br/><p>Three scenes were finished in two days. Such was the high efficiency of weekly American TV series. The audience ratings were surprisingly high. The episode would be airing on CBO the following week.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the film \"Elephant\" had been sent to Cannes and would be in theaters both in France and America at the same time. Of course, no one expected it to be bought by a good theater chain. Profit always ruled.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the considerate publishing, production and investment though, the film would finally be opening in a cinema special for indie films in America. Because of its ambiguous subject, it would only get one week. </p><br/><p>It would be playing twice a day though, if that was any consolation.</p><br/><p>As a result, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei\u2019s timetable would include watching a film in the daytime and a TV series at night. When they stood by the entrance of the best indie cinema in New York, they were shocked.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The movements had been recorded by his muscles. For Qin Guan, whose boots were always on the ground, that elegant skill was far beyond reach.</p><br/><p>Time was pressing, so the training lasted only one day. The next day, Qin Guan had to registered with the crew.</p><br/><p>More than half the play had been finished, but as a supporting actor and a nobody, he had attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went into the dressing room nervously, leaving Sister Xue surrounded by staff members outside.</p><br/><p>F*ck! There are so many people in the crew! She was familiar with the simple modelling backstage, but now she was surrounded by assistants, photographers, logistics assistants, lighting engineers, propmen...</p><br/><p>They were all talking about Qin Guan without any scruple.</p><br/><p>\"A newcomer? I heard that he has not graduated from any film or drama school. He\u2019s only a small-scale model!\" Sister Xue's veins pulsed in anger. A small-scale model? He\u2019s a B level model, got it?</p><br/><p>\"He is really handsome, but this is a play with ancient costumes. He doesn\u2019t look that elegant. Can he really play Zhang Changzong? Looks aren\u2019t everything!\" Not that elegant? He is a poster model for top foreign brands. Top, understand?</p><br/><p>Actually, they were just jealous of the chance Qin Guan had gotten. Even though he was an amateur actor, he had gotten an opportunity many professional actors couldn't get.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the dresser was staring at Qin Guan's face, holding her brush for about three minutes. She couldn't bring herself to do it. According to the role, Zhang Changzong's face had to be white as snow, and the actor had to have powder applied on their face. This was unnecessary in Qin Guan\u2019s case though.</p><br/><p>After several light brushes, the dresser pushed Qin Guan out, gritting her teeth. What a pity! I have put so many skincare products on my face in the past 20 years, yet it was all in vain!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood outside the dressing room in his white robe and blue cloak. His long hair had been pinned into a small bun on his head. He looked as calm and serene as an immortal.</p><br/><p>Everyone fell silent. His acting skills notwithstanding, he definitely qualified to be a decorative vase. Everyone went off and got to work.</p><br/><p>When the director and the producers of the play arrived, Qin Guan became nervous. Gui Yalei, a veteran actor, Chen Hong, an ancient style beauty, and Zhao Wenxun, a handsome man, also arrived.</p><br/><p>They were all famous actors. Sister Xue pushed Qin Guan from behind, reminding him to remain silent. Director Li was straightforward as she made a short introduction, \"This is Qin Guan, who will play Zhang Changzong. Qin Guan, I think you know your colleagues. Let's begin. You can get to know each other in the process.\"</p><br/><p>You are all so cool! Is that okay to say? The older actors were shocked by the director\u2019s words. They were all casting pitying looks at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had nowhere to go. He had to do his best.</p><br/><p>Several embroidery screens had been placed in the hall with the high ceiling and the red pillars. Light entered through the windows, shining on the embroidery frames, which were so thin that one could see the things on their other side.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood before a frame and took a deep breath. His first play had just begun.</p><br/><p>Chen Hong walked along the path between the screens, followed by the camera, which eventually turned toward Qin Guan. A young man in a long robe was standing against the light, doing sewing work in front of the scroll of a lotus painting.</p><br/><p>There were pink lotuses and green leaves on the frame. The painting set off the handsome young man. One could say that it seemed as if a figure had walked out of the scroll and become real.</p><br/><p>Aware of the coming strangers, Qin Guan turned his head gently and smiled brightly, making the lotus pale in comparison.</p><br/><p>Looking at Qin Guan\u2019s elegance and talent with the camera, Li Shaohong cheered him on silently.</p><br/><p>This had exceeded her expectations. Actually, Li had been worried that Qin Guan would pose like a model.</p><br/><p>Now she could relax. Wonderful! He even practised on ancient formalities. The scene has been saved!</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan sat back and began his embroidery work, all the staff members and actors were shocked.</p><br/><p>Is he really that good at embroidery? All his movements are in harmony! Li Shaohong was surprised. She recalled the first time she had met Qin Guan, when he hadn\u2019t even been able to hold a needle. How could he do that now?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had made a good impression on Gui Yalei and Chen Hong. Everyone liked a hardworking guy. His line delivery was also natural. When he hugged Chen Hong though, Li shouted for the first time.</p><br/><p>\"Who are you hugging? Would any toy boy dare hug a princess when they meet for the first time? Besides, your real master is the queen, who is standing behind you. You looked like you were hugging your girlfriend!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed, including Gui Yalei and Chen Hong. In fact, there were no specific instructions on the script. It was all up to the director's interpretation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan understood immediately. A mighty queen had sent her toy boy to her daughter for entertainment. The boy was just a pet, one that should know how far to go and when to stop.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned Li's words over in his mind before he said, \"I see. Let's do it again!\"</p><br/><p>Li Shaohong nodded, and the cameraman got to work again. Qin Guan spread his arms and touched his clothes slightly with his jade-like fingers. He stopped, and Chen Hong naturally leaned against his chest.</p><br/><p>Li clapped her hands lightly. Good comprehension. The princess can lean on you, but you can't embrace her. Qin Guan had mastered the preliminary skills of a toy boy.</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Next!\" At Li's order, the scene was finished with only one interruption. Although he\u2019d had to work with two veteran actors, the green hand hadn\u2019t been nervous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

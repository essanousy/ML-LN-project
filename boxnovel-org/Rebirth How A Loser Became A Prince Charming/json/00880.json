It's nice, isn't it? Your room is ready. Just make yourself at home! I'll have my servant follow you everywhere in Thailand. If you need any help, all you have to do is ask him.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you don't like the food outside, my cook will cook anything you request. I also have several Chinese cooks here. You can have dinner or a night snack any time you like.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that okay for you?\"</p><br/><p>Of course! I'm really satisfied.</p><br/><p>After greeting each other, they both turned to the banquet.</p><br/><p>The banquet was the QC firm's job. Xie Hanren's farther found the accounts of the Chinese firm to be very careful and detailed. Plus, their charges were pretty reasonable. Their business was going better thanks to the Industry and Commerce Administration and the Chinese Tax Department.</p><br/><p>That was why the old man had become interested in the firm. When he found out that the owner was the famous Qin Guan, he made an important decision.</p><br/><p>He decided to treat Qin Guan like a second-generation member of the family. His patriotic family maintained closer contact with the Chinese mainland than other families.</p><br/><p>At the time, their business had been flourishing and the old man was considered the richest guy in Thailand. No flower could bloom for over 100 days though. Even lions aged after a few years.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the whole business would be divided among his offspring and the family would not be the richest one in the country any longer. They would need help from all directions, especially from China. The old man had to weave a network in advance, both in political and business circles.</p><br/><p>The banquet was a knot on that net. Actually, Qin Guan was not averse to this method. What the hell would the princess do at the banquet though?</p><br/><p>The royal family of Thailand had originated from an army coup. Although it exercised constitutional monarchy, the military still played an important role in the nation. Their so-called democracy was closely guarded by soldiers.</p><br/><p>The leader of the current government in Thailand was Thaksin, a man who put the interests of the poor first when it came to national development goals.</p><br/><p>His series of reformations, which were for the welfare of the people, harmed the interests of the wealthy upper class. As a result, the Yellow Jackets were opposing Thaksin, and the Red Jackets were supporting him by fighting back.</p><br/><p>The constant conflict between the Yellow Jackets and the Red Jackets everywhere scared away all foreign visitors.</p><br/><p>The people who relied on tourism to make a living were unsatisfied with the government. Xie was not worried about the chaos though. This was common for local people. Qin Guan was the only one who felt a little anxious.</p><br/><p>Thailand was a country with constitutional monarchy, so the royal family did not have much power. They were still a symbol in common people's eyes though, so the princess sent Xie an envoy to express her intention to meet Qin Guan. She knew that Xie was a friend of his.</p><br/><p>A fan? Okay! That did not affect the bigger picture.</p><br/><p>There were not that many princesses in Thailand, but she was the daughter of the first rani and Thailand's crown prince, so she was a real descendant of the royal family.</p><br/><p>The next evening, Qin Guan attended the private banquet of the Xie family. The guest list included great entrepreneurs from Thailand and the mysterious Princess Bajrakitiyabha.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's graceful manners and handsome looks impressed all the guests, especially the Xie brothers, who knew the difficulties of starting with nothing. It was impossible to achieve so much without talent.</p><br/><p>That was why they treated Qin Guan with sincerity.</p><br/><p>After he passed their test, they agreed to introduce him to the princess. Although the meeting would be private, security was still a must.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

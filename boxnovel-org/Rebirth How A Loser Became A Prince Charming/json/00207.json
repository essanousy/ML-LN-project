Deposit your cash in the bank every day, it\u2019s not too much trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop! Stop! We\u2019ll deal with those affairs later. Go downstairs to the Heaven-Flying Room. Your friends should be there to watch the match.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was pushed out of the room by Wang Hailang.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Tell me, how much do you put in the safe? Listen to me...\"</p><br/><p>The door was closed with a bang. Wang shouted at him from inside, \"You will get older sooner if you think too much! Just enjoy yourself, boy!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head and went to watch the watch. It was time. The Heaven-Flying Room had a beautiful name. Ever since those two had started their business, they had nearly become poets.</p><br/><p>They would have been happy to hear that comment. \"The service in our massage room will make you fly to Heaven!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed the door open and found his roommates lying on the bed next to each other. The TV was hanging from the ceiling just above their heads.</p><br/><p>The commentator was speaking, but nobody was paying attention.</p><br/><p>The bald man was enjoying a massage. \"Ah! Ouch! Nice! Your skills are wonderful, Xiao Xue.\"</p><br/><p>The boys couldn't bear to watch. The fierce, tough man with the scars on his head was as tame as a rabbit under Xiao Xue\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>They were listening to him compliment the girl with disgusting words.</p><br/><p>\"Are you tired, Xiao Xue? Sit here and take a break.\"</p><br/><p>The girl glared at him. \"You\u2019re asking me to take a break? Who will pay me if I don\u2019t finish the massage?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed in and asked, \"What are you doing? Did the match begin? Why are you having a massage now?\"</p><br/><p>Li Jie replied, \"Qin Guan, it\u2019s been a pleasure to be your brother. Nobody knew you were working part-time here. If we\u2019d known that you are good at massages, we would have enjoyed ourselves in our dormitory.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat on an empty bed and took off his shoes. A girl standing by walked over with a bucket in her hands.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a sip of the juice and kicked Li Jie. \"Who told you I\u2019m giving massages here? I\u2019m the CFO, understand? C-F-O!\"</p><br/><p>\"A CFO has to be familiar with the business.\" Liu Xiaoyang put a small white cube on his forehead. The ice water would calm his up-flowing blood.</p><br/><p>The girl serving him was wearing a black silk gown. Her fair neck was as elegant as a swan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang was dizzy. His blood was flowing back again. Before he could see clearly, the opening whistle was heard and the match began.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, the teams pressed each other on the whole field. They did not let up, which was common for a soccer match.</p><br/><p>The UAE team was not a weak one. They had to be treated carefully.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Chinese centre forward intercepted the ball and started advancing. His teammates followed him, trying to protect him.</p><br/><p>After a perfect cooperation, Li Xiaopeng got the ball and shot without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\"Goal!\" In only two minutes, the Chinese team had scored its first goal.</p><br/><p>The commentator was shouting loudly in excitement.</p><br/><p>The boys were also shouting, \"Nice goal!\"</p><br/><p>\"How awful!\"</p><br/><p>Da Niu got scared. His foot jerked and he accidentally kicked Xiao Xue.</p><br/><p>They looked at each other in astonishment. Da Niu's face turned red, but Xiao Xue smiled. Before she could speak, the door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>\"Who\u2019s shouting? We\u2019re closed. Who let you in?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone stared at the uninvited guest in surprise.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Qin?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mou Xiaoliu?\"</p><br/><p>Astonished, Qin Guan asked her, \"What are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Mou Xiaoliu was wearing a club uniform. She looked both happy and uncomfortable to see Qin Guan there. Pointing at Da Niu, she said, \"He is my fellow villager. He recommended me to work here.\"</p><br/><p>\"The club gives us room, board and a high salary. I had nothing to do in the summer holidays, so I came here.\"</p><br/><p>Recalling Mou's power, Qin Guan looked at Da Niu seriously. He had to be a mighty fighter himself. Looks could fool people after all.</p><br/><p>Mou asked back, \"Why are you here, Senior Qin?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan coughed before explaining to her, \"I also work part-time here. There\u2019s a match today, so the boss lent us a room for entertainment purposes. Come here and watch it with us!\"</p><br/><p>Mou Xiaoliu hesitated before shaking her head. \"No, enjoy yourselves. Take care of Da Niu for me. He\u2019s silly around Xiao Xue. I have to go.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. Da Niu was still staring at his own foot, which had touched Xiao Xue. He was paying no attention to Mou.</p><br/><p>The door was shut again. Mou leaned against the wall outside and took a deep breath, covering her pounding heart.</p><br/><p>Senior Qin is still so handsome... I thought time would make everything fade away, but it seems I was fooling myself. I don't want to grow up. Things will only get more difficult. I have to let him go. I\u2019ll just keep the beautiful memories in my mind.</p><br/><p>Opening her eyes, Mou waved her fists towards the sky and then disappeared at the end of the corridor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

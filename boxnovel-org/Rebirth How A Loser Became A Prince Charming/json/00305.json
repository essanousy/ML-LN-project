The man was famous for his appetite for meat.</p><br/><p> Judging by Qin Guan\u2019s speed, the others would have nothing to eat but his leftovers.</p><br/><p> Unwilling to submit, Hu Jun picked up his chopsticks again, ready to fight.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan inserted his chopsticks into the meat. The pork skin on the crisp and soft meat was tender and elastic.</p><br/><p> After chewing it a few times, the meat melted in one\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p> The tasty sauce made everyone feel like they were flying.</p><br/><p> It was the perfect match for the soft-boiled, milled rice of the Zhejiang Province.</p><br/><p> Piece by piece, Qin Guan began to gorge himself. Everyone else was watching Qin Guan and Hu Jun compete with each other. Sister Xue nearly buried her face into her bowl.</p><br/><p> She was so ashamed! On the other hand, Hu Jun\u2019s agent, Wang Jingcao, was watching the competition happily.</p><br/><p> In 10 minutes, the old jar was empty. Qin Guan's chopsticks touched its bottom.</p><br/><p> Huh? There\u2019s nothing left? Qin Guan looked up in disappointment. What are you looking at?</p><br/><p> They were looking at Hu Jun, who had been too eager to eat and had choked.</p><br/><p> As an ordinary human being, he couldn\u2019t catch up with Qin Guan. The tall strong man had lost the battle of the foodies.</p><br/><p> Everyone was silent in the dining room. The onlookers cast glances at Qin Guan's flat belly. Where had the meat gone?</p><br/><p> Everyone else at the table began to seize food, for fear that it would all end up in his stomach.</p><br/><p> \"Sister Wang, I\u2019m full. I\u2019ll take a walk outside.\"</p><br/><p> Before leaving, Hu Jun gave Qin Guan a thumbs-up.</p><br/><p> Had something happened? Before Qin Guan could ask, Sister Xue stopped him. \"The shrimp is nearly gone. Help yourself.\"</p><br/><p> \"Okay.\" Qin Guan got immediately distracted.</p><br/><p> Huang Bo nearly sprayed rice out of his nose. Another joke, huh?</p><br/><p> Wang Jingcao was looking at Liu Tao, who had followed Hu Jun out, anxiously.</p><br/><p> There was going to be trouble! Hu Jun\u2019s wife was staying in the same unit with him. She was also an outstanding actress of the Beijing People\u2019s Art Theater. Hu Jun was a charming man of an unconstrained, bold style. As a green hand, Liu Tao had been easily enchanted by him. Wang could only rely on their conscience.</p><br/><p> The consequences of an extramarital affair would be serious for Hu.</p><br/><p> After the meal, Qin Guan and Huang Bo lay down on their beds. They turned off the lights and left the curtains open.</p><br/><p> White moonlight filled the room as the waddings danced in the air.</p><br/><p> Away from the noisy crowd of the city, Qin Guan felt calm in the embrace of nature.</p><br/><p> Unfortunately, Huang fell asleep before him.</p><br/><p> His terrible snoring woke Qin Guan up with a start.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, someone knocked on their door.</p><br/><p> \"Qin Guan? Are you free now? Come out!\"</p><br/><p> It was Lin Zhiying's Taiwanese accent. Oh, he invited me somewhere earlier.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan got up and went out. He found several people standing outside, including Qiao Feng and Mu Rongfu.</p><br/><p> \"Where are we going on the mountain?\"</p><br/><p> Without an explanation, they pulled him outside the hotel.</p><br/><p> There were five cars parked there.</p><br/><p> \"Where are these from? How did you find such cars in the village?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was shocked. Did they possess magical powers?</p><br/><p> Lin Zhiying was proud of the cars. In his opinion, he was a racing driver first and an actor second. Anywhere he went, he would visit the local racing car market.</p><br/><p> There were racing teams everywhere. The shooting would take a long time though, so Lin had bought a good car the day after his arrival in the Zhejiang Province.</p><br/><p> Li Bai, one of the most famous poets of the Tang Dynasty, exclaimed in one of his poems: \"Walking on the narrow paths of Shu Kingdom is more difficult than climbing up to Heaven!\" Although the mountains in the Zhejiang Province were not as dangerous as those in the Sichuan Province (the Shu Kingdom), the road conditions there attracted plenty of amateur car racers.</p><br/><p> Together with their entourage, the leading actors of the show participated in a car racing team.</p><br/><p> Men always spent money on cars and houses. They had bought one racing car each.</p><br/><p> Luckily, Qin Guan hadn't spent much time with the crew, or he would also have bought one.</p><br/><p> \"Let's go!\"</p><br/><p> \"Whose car do you choose?\" Lin asked him with a gentle voice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The school president had allowed him to shoot on campus during summer vacation, provided that the crew would not interfere with the summer activities.</p><br/><p>When he heard Qu's voice, he turned around. At the sight of Qin Guan, he grew excited.</p><br/><p>\"Ask the prop master for a polo shirt. Then walk to that position on the playground. Right there. Yes... Stand there and look back at me!\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt strange about the director\u2019s casting method. A few minutes later, he walked out of the fitting room in a summer football jersey. The loose shorts and shirt couldn\u2019t cover his charm though. He still looked like a celebrity on campus. Even the students training on the school grounds were distracted by him.</p><br/><p>The players served as a background as he stood there.</p><br/><p>Mark was 20 meters away from him, making a frame with his fingers and zooming in on Qin Guan. As he walked farther and farther away, the man in the frame looked more and more dazzling.</p><br/><p>No matter how far he went, he always spotted Qin Guan among the crowd.</p><br/><p>Mark slowly returned from the other side of the school grounds.</p><br/><p>\"Is it okay for you if we start today?\"</p><br/><p>This was a surprising but most welcome question for Qu and Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\"</p><br/><p>With this problem solved, the producer could save some money.</p><br/><p>The director asked Qin Guan to go to the fitting room again. Then he and the heroine walked to the shooting site. It was an ordinary classroom, where the assistant director was negotiating with a group of people.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, but we have decided on the protagonist\u2026 Yes, five minutes ago. Tough luck...\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you saying? Are you kidding me?\" </p><br/><p>\"We have already started filming. Sorry!\"</p><br/><p>The assistant director asked the group to leave politely.</p><br/><p>Everyone went out of the school. The manager of the group, a domineering white lady, vented all her anger on the others.</p><br/><p>\"I want to know who seized this chance from us. Five minutes ago? Mark and the producer didn\u2019t even give us a chance! You are the Best Actor of Palm Beach! You are the right age and have the right looks\u2026 They must be blind!\"</p><br/><p>Before her voice could fade away, the arrogant woman got out of the car and returned to the school.</p><br/><p>Jonathan Bennett smiled secretly in the car. He was also curious about the guy who had gotten the part. He wanted his agent to spy on the lucky dog. Jonathan was confident about his resume. No one else in that category could have been better than him. </p><br/><p>His agent, whose name was Alice, sneaked into the set with a group of extras.</p><br/><p>Mark was currently sitting behind the camera as the hero and heroine talked about something in the classroom.</p><br/><p>This was a teen film, so most of the extras had been selected from the school\u2019s students. They would just play themselves in the film. High school students were familiar with fashion, so most of them knew Qin Guan, and a few of them knew the female actresses.</p><br/><p>They all gathered around the door, making it easier for Alice to peep inside.</p><br/><p>\"The first scene is the first meeting. Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>There were two cameras in the classroom. One was up front, and the other was in the back. Mark was sitting behind the camera that focused on the heroine. The assistant director was operating the camera that focused on Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Katie, the heroine, was listening to the tutor happily. Qin Guan rummaged in his bag for a while before he looked up and turned around naturally.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a ruby T-shirt, which made a sharp contrast with his curly black hair and dark eyes. He looked like a cup of old wine.</p><br/><p>Putting on his warmest smile, he asked the strange girl sitting behind him, \"Hey, may I borrow your pencil?\"</p><br/><p>The other boys were as dirty as monkeys, but there was not even a speck of dust on his shirt.</p><br/><p>He looked like the morning sun, like a secret kept between young girls.</p><br/><p>As expected, the heroine was moved. Suddenly, the director shouted angrily, surprising both Qin Guan and the assistant director.</p><br/><p>He is perfect! Why did you stop his performance?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was relieved soon.</p><br/><p>\"Lindsay! This is the awakening of a first love, not a fan admiring her idol! What are you doing? Clean yourself up! You are drooling!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Cong Nianwei noticed the bear on his head with a smile. It must be a present for me. Cong Nianwei shouted at Qin Guan, \"I\u2019m coming!\" She stopped by the mirror to check her makeup before she went out. Immediately, her roommates began talking heatedly.</p><br/><p>\"That naughty girl has kept this a secret! Is he her boyfriend?\"</p><br/><p>\"Have you ever been to the public design class? I know him. He has been in the class with Cong Nianwei.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I remember! I know him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha! He really is her boyfriend! He must take us out and treat us!\"</p><br/><p>\"I agree!\"</p><br/><p>When Cong Nianwei met Qin Guan at the gate, she started laughing even louder. His playful shirt was the perfect display of his childish nature. When Qin Guan handed her the big bear, she clearly saw that he was expecting to be praised. Hugging the large bear, Cong Nianwei laughed breathlessly. Where those bear paws on his shirt?</p><br/><p>The boat of love had been turned over. Depressed, Qin Guan saw Cong Nianwei off with the large bear.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had accepted the present and now expected to be treated. Once dinner was over though, he could piss off. I mean, leave. Cong Nianwei had a class in the afternoon, so she had no spare time to spend with him. Idling around the gate sadly, Qin Guan was looked down upon by the administrator. I was right. He was turned down. The girl accepted his present, but ignored him.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei came out with a group of girls as bright as 1,000-watt light bulbs. Her roommates had asked to be treated to dinner. Sighing to himself, Qin Guan gave the girls his most splendid smile. It was so shining, it made them dizzy. Hey stop, you drama queens!</p><br/><p>Giggling and twittering, the girls were introduced to Cong Nianwei\u2019s boyfriend, the host of the dinner. The boy had strange taste, but he was really handsome. If his IQ was inversely proportional to his taste, he would be the perfect boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Chattering and laughing, they headed off to eat. They all had class in the afternoon, so a simple lunch would be enough. They could save the fat lambs for a different occasion.</p><br/><p>Their destination was the dining hall for overseas students, which was the best choice for students in need of improving their lives. There were all kinds of food there, including western-style food, Chinese food, and dishes prepared with special care. When they were all seated, they saw Chi Hailing sitting at the table across from them.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, it was Chi's birthday. He and his roommates had planned on eating there, too.</p><br/><p>He had been planning to only invite Cong Nianwei to celebrate in the evening, so he\u2019d chosen to treat the boys at noon. Unfortunately, he had come across Qin Guan again. Maybe I stole Qin Guan's money in my past life. That could be why he always causes me trouble.</p><br/><p>His expression turned savage, and his color changed from red to white. His roommates asked him carefully, \"What's wrong? Are you feeling sick? Do you have a loose bowel?\"</p><br/><p>Chi Hailing squeezed the words out between his teeth, \"I\u2019m fine. I just saw Cong Nianwei\u2019s boyfriend.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Cong Nianwei has a boyfriend? You\u2019re not her pursuer? You\u2019re the third person?\"</p><br/><p>His silly friend\u2019s voice was loud enough for others to hear. Cong Nianwei's roommates immediately stretched their ears to eavesdrop. Is this a love triangle? The boyfriend and the other man?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about the exciting drama. He was recharging Cong Nianwei's dining card at the service department of the restaurant. There were seven people in total at their table, and the prices varied from six to 20 yuan. Not expensive!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw that there were only 96.7 yuan left in her card. That\u2019s not enough! (That was enough for Cong Nianwei. Not everyone was a foodie like Qin Guan!) Qin Guan took out 1,000 yuan to recharge the card. Imagining the praise he would get, he made the order happily.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's table had become the centre of attention. Most of Chi\u2019s roommates were in the same department as her. As a straight-A student who beat the best students from all over the country, she was famous in her department. It was a surprise to everyone that she had a secret boyfriend who had appeared at QH. They were all craning their necks in her direction.</p><br/><p>\"Where is he?\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s just her and her roommates.\"</p><br/><p>\"Did you make a mistake, Chi?\"</p><br/><p>Chi Hailing gritted his teeth. \"Definitely not. I\u2019d recognize him even if he was burnt to ashes.\" Of course, you could never forget a man who had pasted snot on your hand.</p><br/><p>\"He was ordering. I saw him holding Cong Nianwei\u2019s card.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Is he having a free meal? We\u2019ll watch him later.\"</p><br/><p>People had different personalities. There were both clever and stupid friends. Not all the students at QH were sensible. There were many people with a high IQ and a low EQ.</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin's best friend was sitting beside him. They were always acting in collusion with each other. I mean, love and devotion. If my best friend is in trouble, I have to support him! He didn't know who Qin Guan was, but he planned to make things difficult for him. This is QH, my own university. I won\u2019t be afraid of anybody. Then what? Then nothing. Qin Guan finished his order and returned to the table. Pointing at Chi Hailin, Cong Nianwei warned Qin Guan that he and another boy were coming over.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

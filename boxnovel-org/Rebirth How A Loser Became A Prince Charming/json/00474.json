You should offer him three scented candlesticks a day...\"</p><br/><p>Xu nodded again and again, while Cong Nianwei finally burst into laughter. Qin Guan was getting more and more curious. He walked over and interrupted them.</p><br/><p>\"Wait a moment. This sounds strange. Master, what are you planning for my firm? Lions? Guandi?\"</p><br/><p>Zhong Changjie was stunned. Twisting his macrochaeta, he answered, \"What's the matter? My plan worked for the gangster headquarters...\"</p><br/><p>Everyone burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Master Zhong, this is an accounting firm. It engages in finance...\" Xu reminded him awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Zhong's hand shook as he pulled several of his hairs out. The bastard didn't clarify about the situation. I thought it was another one of his father\u2019s stores! I was totally wrong! Their clients would get scared if they saw a shrine of Guandi.</p><br/><p>He put the blame on Xu. \"You should have told me in advance. I would have made a different plan.\"</p><br/><p>To restore his image, the master opened his bag and searched through his tools.</p><br/><p>Holding a heavy golden compass in his hand, he took a deep breath and then let it out. He looked completely cheered up.</p><br/><p>\"Ha!\" He cleared his throat. Lan Jin, who was still laughing beside him, fell down from his chair with a startle.</p><br/><p>The master stood up straight and held the compass up. The compass began to spin fast. A few minutes later, it stopped. The hand of the inner dial overlapped with the red line on the outside dial.</p><br/><p>\"A fortune will be made here. The boss should sit in this spot. Put a dharma-vessel here to attract riches and good luck.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the spot speechlessly. That was Qin Guan's desk, which had been designed by Cong Nianwei. The master was really smart. Anybody could become a master!</p><br/><p>Xu was convinced though. He decided to buy a dharma-vessel for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head and shouted at his staff, \"Okay, get back to work! There is only a little time left. I\u2019ll take you all out in the evening! My treat!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Long live our boss!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you!\"</p><br/><p>The girls and Lan Jin applauded before they returned to work happily. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>They all looked at each other. Who is it? The property staff of the building? The neighbours?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went to answer the door. \"Who\u2019s there?\"</p><br/><p>A familiar stranger was standing outside the glass wall.</p><br/><p>It was Qingmu from Citizen. He looked like a sun-dried frog who had cried its eyes out. He seemed to be saying something to Qin Guan. who hastened to open the door for him.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qingmu? What are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Qingmu kneeled down before Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin Guan! Help me!\" He collapsed on the floor of the front hall, looking like he had been relieved off a heavy burden.</p><br/><p>Everyone rushed over, stupefied by the scene. It was sad to see a strong man crying and murmuring like that. Qin Guan felt strange. A lot of strange things were happening that day.</p><br/><p>Zhong twisted his macrochaeta again. \"The gentleman\u2019s temples look dark and his forehead is dim. I\u2019m afraid his life is in danger.\"</p><br/><p>He is lying on his stomach. How can you see his forehead and temples?</p><br/><p>Qingmu looked upset at his words. Suddenly, he looked up.</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! I\u2019m doomed, Mr. Qin Guan! Only you can save me!\"</p><br/><p>Zhong shook his head proudly as Xu looked at him in admiration. Confused, Qin Guan pointed to his office.</p><br/><p>\"I don't know what's going on, but let\u2019s talk about it in my office.\"</p><br/><p>Qingmu agreed. He had succeed in convincing everyone that he was devastated. He climbed up from the floor and wiped his tears on his sleeves, forgetting about his dignity.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

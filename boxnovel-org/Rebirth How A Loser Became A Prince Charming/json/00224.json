As far as I know, he has co-starred in two TV shows. He is not that influential.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had been attacked at a crucial point. She tried to explain awkwardly, \"Mr. Qin has acted in three TV shows and three advertisements. Besides, he is on the cover of VOGUE China. That black-and-white photo is his current image.\"</p><br/><p>The two men read the material carefully again. Sister Xue went on, \"Plus, this is only a primary negotiation. I would suggest that you see him in person before we discuss this any further.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know that model selection is decided by the Marketing Department, but if Chief Editor Qu recommended me to you, this means that you choose brand ambassadors very carefully. It's necessary for you to see the model personally.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Changchuan, who had remained silent thus far, opened his mouth. \"You make a good point. We are strict with our ambassador in 2002, because we have a brand new product coming out this year. It's a solar watch for ladies. The model for the men's mechanical watches will cooperate with the female model, so we have to be extremely strict. May I have the honor of meeting Mr. Qin?\"</p><br/><p>This sharp turn astonished Shanchuan and Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, my pleasure.\" Sister Xue and Zhuanchuan smiled. \"I\u2019ll decide the place, and you can choose the date. Is that okay for you?\"</p><br/><p>Zhuanchuan touched the photo and smiled. \"Sure, Ms. Xue.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue waved farewell to the two directors after those good news. She had to prepare before making the final shot.</p><br/><p>She called Qin Guan and invited Professor Li. After getting a general idea about the process, Professor Li said thoughtfully, \"Listen to me, we have to find Teacher Rong.\"</p><br/><p>That was why Teacher Rong saw those three special guests at her gate.</p><br/><p>She invited them in calmly. In the main hall, she asked, \"Tell me, what\u2019s the matter?\"</p><br/><p>Professor Li was unpleasant. \"Why? I can\u2019t visit you unless there\u2019s something wrong? You have a point though. I need your help.\"</p><br/><p>Finally, they made a decision. Teacher Rong was unsatisfied with their nervousness. \"Take it easy. Why are you guys so serious about that Japanese brand?\"</p><br/><p>As a history tutor, Teacher Rong said angrily, \"It\u2019s only a tiny island.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue tried to flatter her, \"Exactly, they are just a bridge for us. There\u2019s no right job for Qin Guan. He wants to be famous not just in China, but all over Asia. Besides, we want to shock those Japanese guys with your skills. They admire Chinese culture the most.\"</p><br/><p>Teacher Rong was convinced by Sister Xue. I should do my best if I decide to give a hand.</p><br/><p>She sized Qin Guan up and said, \"Come over tomorrow, Qin Guan. I\u2019ll find something better for you.\"</p><br/><p>Professor Li knew her old friend really well. She would cheer up with anything concerning national pride.</p><br/><p>How fast time flied! It was already time for the meeting. It was September in Beijing. The autumn sky was clear, the air was crisp and the scenery was beautiful.</p><br/><p>Zhuchuanlongfu\u2019s business car headed downtown. He was wearing a casual outfit and watching the historical sights outside, hitting a folding fan against his hand. \"The essence of the old capital is definitely in Shichahai. \"</p><br/><p>For a city without a river, Shichahai was beautiful. There were many historical sites, such as the Bell Tower, the Drum Tower, Song Qingling's former residence, and the Prince Gong Mansion.</p><br/><p>It would be wonderful to have quadrangle dwellings there. One could cultivate oneself inside and enjoy the lake outside.</p><br/><p>Zhuchuan was getting more and more surprised. As a foreigner, he could notice the scarcity of residences in Shichahai. What was Qin Guan's real identity?</p><br/><p>He parked his car in Yar Hutong. Words couldn't express his feelings. There were only three gates on the street, which meant that there were only three house masters.</p><br/><p>Shanchuan was even more surprised than him. He kept thinking, \"Surely, this doesn't mean that Qin Guan is something more than a model?\"</p><br/><p>With that question in mind, they walked up to the large gate. Stone lions stood on both its sides. The assistant walked up the stairs paved with green rocks.</p><br/><p>The red-lacquer gate was even higher. The assistant stood on his toes to reach the copper ring.</p><br/><p>Clang, clang. They could hear ancient, mysterious echoes. Not long after, a man answered the door in an authentic capital accent. \"Who is it?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Is it millions? Billions? That's the basic price for a famous professor. Plus, how many architects win international awards? How many architects graduate from renowned colleges every year? How many graduates have the ability to open their own firms?\"</p><br/><p>\"Most people try their best to get a government position, which makes them practically no profit. Then, they have to wait for a promotion based on their seniority. This is the status quo of the Chinese construction industry. There are too many people involved in it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Experience is an advantage in your CV, but it's not enough for you to stand out. You are still a poor young architect.\"</p><br/><p>The young man, who was not convinced, pointed to Cong Nianwei, who was far away.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Cong Nianwei is just as young, but she is really down-to-earth. She does not work for the government. What's her end game?\"</p><br/><p>The elder man smiled.</p><br/><p>\"I do admit that she really loves her job. However, her silly husband is filthy rich. If you have a billionaire for a husband, of course you can focus on architectural design and becoming a famous architect. Unfortunately, you don't have that kind of talent or luck.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are biased! She is a good architect and Qin Guan is just as talented. He is not some silly guy!\"</p><br/><p>\"He is silly if he turned away a whole forest for a single tree.\"</p><br/><p>The young man looked over again and saw Qin Guan show up with a cup of juice.</p><br/><p>\"Wei, take a sip and rest a little. Your lips are dry...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no time to pay attention to anyone else. Cong Nianwei occupied his mind completely.</p><br/><p>I must keep her in high spirits. 2008 is my lucky year. Our wedding has to take place in spring. March would be ideal. I should nourish her body before that. She is too tired. Will she be okay if she has to give birth to a child?</p><br/><p>Everyone was lost in their own thoughts. Cong Nianwei was focused on her work, while Qin Guan was thinking of having a baby.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an inspection group showed up. It was already familiar with everyone on the construction site, so Qin Guan attracted the directors' attention.</p><br/><p>\"Who is that?\" one of them asked.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan. He is the president of QC accounting firm,\" an assistant replied.</p><br/><p>\"Is he our partner?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, he is an actor. He has won acting awards in Cannes, Berlin and Venice and starred in Director Zhang Yimou's film.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, it's him. Why would an actor open an accounting firm?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is a businessman first and an actor second.\"</p><br/><p>The assistant made a short introduction about Qin Guan. He made sure to mention his achievements and his place on the Forbes Ranking List.</p><br/><p>By that time, Qin Guan ranked 108th on the list. His firm could also be considered the most successful one in China. Even though it was a local accounting firm, QC had some advantages over the four biggest international accounting firms. After a short while, those foreigners would discover China's road to economic development.</p><br/><p>Thus, Qin Guan was not worried about China's temporarily inferior position in the high-end market. He also remained calm about the fortune people made on the internet. In his opinion, the Chinese economy shouldn't be relying on real estate or the internet. If their nation remained this unhealthy, it would follow into Japan's or the US' footsteps someday.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

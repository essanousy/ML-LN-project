There were eight cameras around, aiming at them from all directions.</p><br/><p> The director might use some shots of them during the editing process, so all the actors were nervous. Their job was more exhausting than a fierce fight.</p><br/><p>After all, in a sense, mental work was more tiring than manual work.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was the most relaxed one, joined in the fun.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, everyone! Don't sit here. We are really close to the chocolate river. It's very dangerous! There is a poisonous gas here. If you stay too long, your brain will stop functioning!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pulled the children away. The adults also left as soon as possible. Fortunately, the next scene was on a different site.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed the naughty kids towards the lounge and then headed to his own rest area. He had a long, soft couch he could relax on after work.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, Qu would be there to prepare a cold beverage for him.</p><br/><p>A cup of iced coffee was on the table as a woman in a suit was rummaging inside a large cabinet.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan collapsed on the couch and poured the coffee into his mouth. When the cold stream flowed to his stomach, Qin Guan felt refreshed. It was as if he had come back to life again.</p><br/><p>He leaned back against the couch elegantly and patted the spot next to him, shouting, \"Well done, darling! Come on, stop working now! For heaven's sake, I left the room for you. I left the emperor by himself!\"</p><br/><p>Proud of his joke, Qin Guan looked at his cup again. Wait! There is a pink lip stain on the edge of the cup!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan touched his own lips, which were as pale as his face. Then he looked at the woman.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she raised her head to reveal her blonde hair. She was wearing the same gray suit as Qu Xuemei, but her fair skin looked like pure snow.</p><br/><p>It was not Qu. It was actually one of the producers, Jennifer. To some extent, Qin Guan had to rely on her to make a living.</p><br/><p>Jennifer burst into laughter at the Asian man, who was lying on the couch handsomely. This was the first time she had laughed in a long time.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Qin Guan. You must have mistaken me for someone else.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt so awkward that he forgot to change his posture. \"Where is Qu?\" he asked with one hand on his head and one on his hip.</p><br/><p>\"She had some work to do and had to leave early. You can call her if there is an emergency.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay... Sorry, I made a mistake\u2026 The coffee... Would you like to take a seat?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan started talking nonsense as he offered her the couch. Life was always filled with little accidents. The two strangers got to know each other quickly thanks to that innocuous coincidence.</p><br/><p>As they offered the couch to each other politely, the door was pushed open and a handsome blond man walked in angrily.</p><br/><p>\"I'm really busy these days, Jennifer. Why are you discussing our private life with everyone? Are you pleased with yourself?\"</p><br/><p>His voice was low, but full of anger. It was Brad Pitt, Jennifer's husband. Suddenly, he realized his wife was throwing flirtatious looks at the handsome man lying on the couch.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! What are you doing? You have been accusing me of infidelity, yet you are flirting with another man. You have been slandering me and Angelina, but now I caught you in the act!\"</p><br/><p>Jennifer's eyes turned red at his reproach.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There is a group of girls at the entrance of the alley. They are holding bouquets and glow sticks...\"</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his words, Tong Xiangyu pointed at Qin Tenyun, who was still blocking the door with all his might.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Tong, Yan realized who the man was. Qin Guan greeted him and introduced himself. He was Yan's successor and the youngest son of a former constable. Wherever he went, there was a group of fans following him.</p><br/><p>Back then, a chief constable was equal in power to a director of a district police security bureau. Constables worked for the government and their position was passed down from generation to generation. Such a handsome guy with a high social status would undoubtedly become many girls' idol. The man was annoyed by the fans.</p><br/><p>He had reached the Tongfu Inn after three days of riding. The fans had been following him day and night. Now that he had reached his domain, he just wanted to get some sleep.</p><br/><p>\"Tengyun! Tengyun, I love you!\" a woman was shouting loudly outside.</p><br/><p>This was a lot like Qin Guan's real-life experiences. Qin Guan wondered if Ning Caishen had adapted the script especially for him.</p><br/><p>The scene was a piece of cake for him. When the fans broke in, Qin Guan started running around the hall until the staff of the Tongfu Inn pushed them out. He finished the scene so fast that even Bai Zhantang, who was the protagonist, was impressed by his performance. Actually, Qin Guan was used to this kind of situation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grabbed Bai's hands and gazed at Bai fiercely, looking really wise and righteous.</p><br/><p>\"Great! It was a good decision to bring Qin Guan here! He is perfect for the role!\"</p><br/><p>\"I feel sorry for Sha Yi. He looks overwhelmed. He should just adapt in the future. Comedians are not meant to be handsome.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. They would all have a bright future if they were serious about their performance.\"</p><br/><p>\"They can't be worse than they used to be, anyway. Before this show, they were mere extras.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Opportunities are rare, but talented people are easy to find in the entertainment circle.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan's participation makes me more confident. The audience ratings of this episode are expected to increase by 1%.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are really ambitious!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>\"How long do you want Qin Guan to maintain that expression? Sha Yi left 15 seconds ago!\"</p><br/><p>\"I think the audience would like to see his face a little longer.\"</p><br/><p>Okay, you are the director. It's up to you.</p><br/><p>Ning Caishen kicked Shang on the butt and told him, \"Okay! Cut! Get ready for the next scene! Yao Chen, you two will be partners in the next scene!\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\" Qin Guan had already gotten used to the director's tricks and the extended shooting schedule.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he was handed a folding fan. That would be his only prop during the scene.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your understanding, Qin Guan. You know our budget is limited...\"</p><br/><p>Okay, okay. It's all up to you.</p><br/><p>He walked over again, waving his fan in the winter. Guo Furong's shouts had moved him to tears.</p><br/><p>\"Do you understand my feelings?\"</p><br/><p>Guo grimaced. \"No.\" The director filmed a meticulously close, high-definition shot of Qin Guan's face. He had a strict expression on his face as he delivered the most self-absorbed words in the world. His appearance overshadowed his strange feelings.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

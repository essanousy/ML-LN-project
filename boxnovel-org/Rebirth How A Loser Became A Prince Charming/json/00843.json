What a pity!</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could think too much about it, people started taking their seats around him. He looked up and saw countless strange faces.</p><br/><p>Aaron Kwok, Leung Ka-Fai, Simon Yam... Every single one of them was a Hong Kong gangster film star. They were the loyal and mighty blood brothers in the Chinese audience's memory. In the middle sat a young guy who was fond of culture and arts...</p><br/><p>What a strange group of people!</p><br/><p>Zhou Xun was sitting among a group of actresses with a forced smile. She was discussing something with Sammi Cheng and Sylvia Chang.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew that they were making fun of him. Before he could stand to warn Zhou, a thick, large hand patted him on the back.</p><br/><p>Leung Ka-Fai spoke to him with the might of a gang leader, the manner of a killer and the smile of a psychopath. \"You have won four acting awards. You are already the most famous actor in the Chinese film circle, so let this award go. Don't compete against us.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan swallowed nervously. This is not a secret deal, Brother. There is a big number of judges voting for the final result.</p><br/><p>\"All young men have dreams, Brother Leung. Could you please give me a chance to make a grand slam? If you care about my happiness, would you leave this Chinese award to me?\"</p><br/><p>I like this shameless guy!</p><br/><p>Leung burst into laughter and hugged Qin Guan. \"You are really funny, dude. Next time you come to Hong Kong, I'll pick you up from the airport. Forget about Nicolas Tse! I like befriending young men!\"</p><br/><p>As they were whispering to each other, Eric Tsang, who was the host of the event, fixed his eyes on them.</p><br/><p>\"It's nice to see two competitors talk so harmoniously. It seems like they won't come to blows over the award. The next award is the highest honor for any actor!\"</p><br/><p>He opened the envelope solemnly and read the names out loud in the most dramatic manner. The host was actually trembling.</p><br/><p>\"The actors selected for the next round are Aaron Kwok, Leung Ka-Fai, Simon Yam and Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>\"And the winner is... Leung Ka-Fai...\" His voice trailed off as Leung turned to comfort the young man next to him. Then Tsang finished his sentence loudly.</p><br/><p>\"... and Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>What? Everyone turned to the host in shock.</p><br/><p>What? Another double-yolked egg? Where is the other award then?</p><br/><p>Tsang pulled a second award from under the table. The twin girls stood there with their shoulders touching.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Leung exchanged a glance and then walked to the stage through the narrow hallway, their shoulders also touching. They accepted their awards together, enjoying the highest honor an actor could experience.</p><br/><p>They clanked their awards like glasses and then lifted them up. This simple gesture made the atmosphere heat up. Everyone got really excited.</p><br/><p>This was an interesting result. It was a success for both traditional gangster films and modern indie films. Even Zhou Xun, who was an award-winning actress herself, couldn't help but admire the handsome young man on the stage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was only 26 years old. He was still at the prime of his life, yet he had been winning awards one after the other. No common person would have expected this.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, no one could predict his limitations or how stressful his future might be. Nobody could guess his thoughts or intent. He was like a breeze in the Chinese and international film circle. A breeze that was getting fiercer and fiercer. A small tornado that would turn into a global storm.</p><br/><p>The tornado had travelled from Europe to North America and then Asia, getting larger and stronger. Qin Guan won every award, as if there was no competition.</p><br/><p>The year 2006 belonged to him. He was the man who had defined the entertainment circle in Asia, as well as the Western world. The most splendid star that night in Hong Kong left as fast as he could, creating enough topics of conversation for the entire city to discuss.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

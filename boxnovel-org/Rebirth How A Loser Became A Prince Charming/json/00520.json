People were curious about the guy's singing voice. He was more handsome than Nick after all.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei couldn't help grimacing. She had been tortured many times by his bathroom singing. Considering his professional singing experience, Qin Guan would be facing a great challenge.</p><br/><p>The ever-victorious general seemed to be suffering a setback. </p><br/><p>However, Qin Guan answered calmly, \"Okay, but I don't know any English songs. Actually, I\u2019m too busy to have time for music.\"</p><br/><p>Dude, most of the guests are musicians. Nick chuckled to himself, while Qu frowned and looked at Qin Guan's seat. He seems strange. </p><br/><p>Suddenly, she saw a large empty glass with a straw in it. The liquid had been nearly finished. Qin Guan must have drunk it with his food.</p><br/><p>Qu sniffed at the glass and detected a subtle smell of alcohol. It was a fruit cocktail. It tasted good, but its power was great.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had drunk a full 500 ml of it without noticing. That explained his strange smile.</p><br/><p>Damn it! Nobody knows what he will do in such a state. He has never touched a cigarette or drunk liquor during work. </p><br/><p>Qin Guan had gotten the microphone from Nick. The angry audience fell silent.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone knows that I come from China. My native language is Chinese. Music should be a mixture of many artistic languages. Don\u2019t limit yourselves to European and American pop music. You should look further and broaden your horizons. All musical prodigies and famous composers have learned from other people's strong points. American music should be unique.\"</p><br/><p>The drunkard was giving the musicians a lecture. He looked like an apprentice blaming a criminal for an unsuccessful crime.</p><br/><p>\"Pay attention to my song. You might never have heard it before. Professional composers and publishers could take advantage of this chance to record it.\"</p><br/><p>Qu was preparing to face the music the next day. Only the three ladies, who had no idea about Qin Guan's ability, were waiting for the song in awe.</p><br/><p>As expected, the song was remarkably fierce and original.</p><br/><p>\"After crossing so many mountains,</p><br/><p>And rivers</p><br/><p>The central Red Army finally reached the North of Shaanxi</p><br/><p>Thousands of households...\"</p><br/><p>It was a famous folk song from North of Shaanxi.</p><br/><p>Both Cong Nianwei and Qu crashed their cups in their hands.</p><br/><p>The miserable audience was stupefied. What a high-pitched voice! What a melodious tune! Its country vibe couldn't be expressed with words.</p><br/><p>Some people took notes, writing down the strange musical notes. They were inspired by that song, which seemed to have come from a completely different world.</p><br/><p>When they began to get used to Qin Guan's voice, he changed to another song. He seemed like he wanted to sing a medley.</p><br/><p>\"The swan and the geese... In the sky\u2026 Fly in rows... The river was long\u2026 The grass was withered\u2026 Sweet lingering music was played on the lute...\"</p><br/><p>It was a Mongolian folk song. Qin Guan's voice was average, but his good memory helped him remember all kinds of songs.</p><br/><p>The songs attracted the audience. M, a producer interested in songs with an exotic charm, was really excited.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! I have no idea what the lyrics mean, but these songs are great!\"</p><br/><p>\"I think I fell in love with the second one,\" a lady fanning herself with a sandalwood fan murmured.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan knelt down and stretched his hand out for the fan. Feeling extremely flattered, the lady handed him the luxurious fan, which was decorated with jade and pearls. He is worthy of the fan. Look at that bright, jade-like smile of his...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan winked at her naughtily, which made Hilton feel depressed. I have a fan too!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spread the fan and covered half of his face with it with the most elegant gesture in the world. Suddenly, he changed into another person, an enchanting, graceful man.</p><br/><p>The light went through the hollow patterns of the fan, scattering on his face. The reflection of the jewellery was sparkling in the dark.</p><br/><p>His eyes looked mysterious under his long eyelashes. His lips looked tender and beautiful under the red light.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

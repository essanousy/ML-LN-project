He looked up in disappointment. \"It\u2019s Citizen. Chief Editor Qu, I think I deserve Patek Philippe or Vacheron Constantin. Piaget and Roles would also be acceptable.\"</p><br/><p>Qu was left speechless by his boasting. She threw an eraser at him to shut him up.</p><br/><p>\"You idiot! You let Cartier go! Do you think I can find another good chance like that in Asia? Stop dreaming! Citizen is good enough for you. You\u2019re only a B level model after all. Go to the audition first.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan caught the eraser in the air and gave her an apologetic smile. \"Don't be angry, Sister Qu. I\u2019ll pass the audition for you.\"</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei burst into laughter. A smile on her serious face was like a beautiful flower in the snow.</p><br/><p>\"You are really optimistic. You\u2019ll be competing against Jincheng Wu, Fanting Longshi, Fushanyazhi and Zhang Dongjian. They are a lot more popular than you. Besides, they\u2019ve had leading roles in films and TV shows. Sure you\u2019ll pass the audition!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan choked when he heard the names she mentioned.</p><br/><p>\"Are you kidding me, Sister Qu? With so many choices, why would they even decide to have an audition?\"</p><br/><p>Qu sneered at him. \"That's why I call you an idiot. They are all top actors in their own nations, but when shepherds quarrel, the wolf wins. Understand? So long as the final choice is not made, you have a hope.\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides, you are cheaper and you have a charming face. If you fail to beat the men, you could compete with the women. There are also ladies\u2019 watches in there.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan cleared his throat awkwardly. \"Who are the female competitors?\"</p><br/><p>Where is your dignity? Do you really plan to compete with the ladies?</p><br/><p>Qu smiled proudly. \"Let me see. Kyoko Fukada...\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop!\" Qin Guan broke in. It was better to compete against the men and have a chance to cooperate with beautiful girls.</p><br/><p>Qu didn't know his plan though. \"Okay, just read the material carefully at home. I\u2019ll inform Sister Xue.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded tamely and began to arrange all the paperwork. Qu felt strange. \"What? A chance is not enough? You want me to treat you to dinner too? So much for today. What are you waiting for?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan seemed hesitant to speak. \"No, but just now... You and me...\"</p><br/><p>Qu pointed to the door. \"What do you mean? What happened just now? I just like to intimidate others. What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nothing, It's fine. I have to go. Bye!\" Qin Guan let out a long sigh of relief and smiled.</p><br/><p>The door was shut. Qu opened the shades and watched Qin Guan, who was talking enraptured with Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>Her secretary was busy making tea for him as he dealt with her enthusiasm clumsily.</p><br/><p>Qu burst into laughter again.</p><br/><p>That was a very different boy. Qu had thought deeply for a long time before she had recommended Qin Guan to Fang. Then he had appeared in her office again. She couldn't tell if she was disappointed or happy about it.</p><br/><p>People set different moral standards for themselves. Qu had a different view on temptation. Fang was only a small failure for Qin Guan, but she had taken a big step forward.</p><br/><p>She returned to her desk. There was an email draft on her PC screen addressed to the VOGUE headquarters. Qu decided to wait for the results of the Citizen audition before sending it.</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan might help her get a promotion.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about that. He was only focused on his courses, his job and his happy life.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei went upstairs hand in hand. The building was scarily empty that day. Their steps echoed in the corridor.</p><br/><p>They entered the classroom and saw that less than half of the students had showed up. It seemed that 9/11 had influenced their plans for studying overseas.</p><br/><p>Both Lan Jin and Cun Jun were not in attendance.</p><br/><p>When they sat in their usual seats, the two guys behind them greeted them nonchalantly, \"Hello!\"</p><br/><p>It was great to see such calm faces.</p><br/><p>Just before the class started, a redhead poked his head inside the door. \"Aha! I\u2019m not late!\"</p><br/><p>Lan Jin rushed into the classroom with his shining red hair and jangling accessories. He noticed Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei right away and ran over to them.</p><br/><p>Surprised, Qin Guan stared at him. \"You convinced your mother to let you come?\"</p><br/><p>Lan pointed at himself proudly. \"Of course! I watched the news. Wow! It was just like an American blockbuster! My father and I were amused. The old fogey is not sympathetic at all. He wants to send me to the US for gold plating. He\u2019s taking pleasure in their misfortune. We convinced my mother. Nothing can stop a real man like me from going to the US!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They would be perfect for work that day.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qu exchanged a glance and cheered up.</p><br/><p>\"Acting independently is good for you!\"</p><br/><p>Then they turned to their hero, Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Are you ready?</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><br/><p>They pushed the door open together. Their team was waiting outside, and so was Qin Guan's guide Alessandro, who saluted them. \"Follow me, please!\"</p><br/><p>Flashlights were twinkling at the entrance of the hotel. The reporters, who had been waiting there for a long time, pointed their microphones and cameras at Qin Guan. There was still dew on their clothes.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin Guan, is this your first time in Milan? What do you think of the city?\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you like it here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin Guan, may we know what your schedule will be in Milan?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked back and saw that some hotel residents were jammed at the entrance by the crowd.</p><br/><p>He turned his head around with a professional smile. Alessandro whispered something to him just in time.</p><br/><p>He didn't answer any of the questions. Instead, he pointed to a street not far from the hotel.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your warm welcome. My first job in Milan is over there. If you are interested, you can take a look. I'll be very happy to go with you. We should give the hotel residents a chance to go out though...\"</p><br/><p>Then he winked at the guests jammed at the entrance.</p><br/><p>The reporters relaxed. Qin Guan was kind and considerate with everyone. He was a sweet guy with a soft heart.</p><br/><p>They all followed him out on the street. Before the security guards could arrive, the crowd had already dispersed automatically.</p><br/><p>The location was an ancient alley with plain paved roads and moss growing in dark corners.</p><br/><p>The high roofs of the old houses blocked most of the sunshine in the alley, making it seem gloomy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's first task was to shoot some promotion photos for the Fashion Week. He could take any pictures he liked, regardless of the style and outfit.</p><br/><p>Of course, if the photos were not good enough, the organizing committee would throw them away and not invite him again next year.</p><br/><p>The photographer took all his cameras out, and the lighting master assembled all his tools. They wanted to get to work as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue took out a small camera to take a street snap for Qin Guan's fans. She also had a laptop on hand for gathering data.</p><br/><p>\"Are you ready, Qin Guan? There are no fixed poses. Just move as you like!\" the official photographer of the Milan Fashion Week told him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded and fixed his costume. Then he spread his arms and leaned against the wall. A lone beam of sunshine was hitting his face like a kiss from the rising sun.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked away from his face and focused on the clothes on his body. The black silk had a unique noble texture with no color or pattern.</p><br/><p>It was not a simple outfit by any means though. It was actually very soft and fine. Besides the silk clothes, there was also a thin white linen coat. It was a combination of traditional Chinese garments and Western clothes, so the pure white color was not flamboyant. It actually looked like a traditional Chinese landscape painting.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's pose made him look like an immortal.</p><br/><p>The camera started functioning as the reporters got lost in the scene.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Were you planning on dashing back? Fortunately, Qin Guan had showed weakness and saved his own life.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his room and found Huang sleeping deeply. He didn\u2019t turn on the lights. He washed his face under the moonlight instead.</p><br/><p>The excitement after the race finally turned into sleepiness. Qin Guan fell asleep soon.</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the room. Qin Guan had a good night\u2019s sleep on the quiet mountain.</p><br/><p>Early the next morning, the crew had a traditional Zhejiang Province breakfast that included pancakes, fried breadsticks, sticky rice buns, as well as hot soybean milk.</p><br/><p>After breakfast, they packed all their luggage and props. The truck would carry everything down the hill.</p><br/><p>The villagers saw them off reluctantly.</p><br/><p>Every year, Director Zhang would bring them lots of money. The hotels and the small restaurants serving breakfast and food late at night made great profits from them.</p><br/><p>It didn't matter. So long as the God of Wealth engaged in TV shows, he would always return to his favorite place, the Zhejiang Province. Their lives would get better and better.</p><br/><p>The crew returned to the city center and started preparing for their trip to Dali in the Yunnan Province. As an indoorsman, Qin Guan was longing for the beautiful rural landscape.</p><br/><p>After enduring the hardships of a long journey, they arrived in Dali. Qin Guan, who had experienced a generous budget before during the \"Daming Palace\", was still shocked by Zhang Jizhong\u2019s large expenditure.</p><br/><p>He had negotiated with the officials of the Dali Municipal Government. They had even built a film studio in the famous Cang Mountain-Er Lake scenery site. The name of the base was \"Demi-Gods and Demi-Demons\".</p><br/><p>At the gateway of the city, they saw a rampart as high as eight metres, made of grey bricks. The gate was six metres tall. The gate tower combined Yunnan architecture and traditional Song Dynasty architecture. The entrance of the city attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>If audience ratings were below expectations, they would be blamed for all aspects.</p><br/><p>After filming was finished, the base would be open to the public. Without a profit, the crew couldn't bear that responsibility. Director Zhang was the bravest director in China.</p><br/><p>They settled down at the base and realized it was quite far from downtown. When the gate was shut, it was a separate world.</p><br/><p>Thick fog lingered around the snowy hills behind the base. It looked like the Piaomiao Peak. From then on, Qin Guan became the most important actor on set. He had taken over most parts.</p><br/><p>The director didn\u2019t have a private talk with him. Acting was an actor\u2019s duty. There was nothing to say.</p><br/><p>The second half of the show had officially begun. There were really exciting scenes coming up one after the other.</p><br/><p>Monk Xuzhu began his rule-breaking journey. He ate meat, killed people and made love to a girl...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was looking forward to his scenes in the following days.</p><br/><p>He met his partner Chen Hao in a small ancient-style tavern. The girl playing the part of A Zi had unparalleled beauty.</p><br/><p>Compared to Li Yifen\u2019s youth, Chen Hao was in her prime time. Her most prominent feature were her beautiful black eyes.</p><br/><p>There would be a bloody slaughter in that tavern.</p><br/><p>The cameras were arranged and all the figurants were in position. Qin Guan and Huang Bo were both busy every day.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Sister Xue's influence, Huang Bo had lines again that day. He would be playing a waiter in the tavern.</p><br/><p>Xuzhu was on his way to find his master, whom he had been separated from for a long time. He was both hungry and thirsty, so he entered the tavern.</p><br/><p>At the same time, A Zi, who was dressed as a man, went in herself.</p><br/><p>\"Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Huang Bo welcomed Qin Guan with a white towel on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\"What can I do for you, young master?\"</p><br/><p>\"I want some noodles with vegetables.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, wait a moment.\"</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was swallowing his noodles at a table, A Zi walked up to him with a mysterious smile. The simple, pure monk was doomed to be deceived by the evil girl.</p><br/><p>Huang Bo stole the show. \"What can I do for you, Miss?\"</p><br/><p>A Zi was much more beautiful compared to Qin Guan, whose face was covered with dust and dirt. One could tell by the shine in Huang\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Chen Hao was also a skilful actress. She turned her eyes around with a wicked idea in her mind.</p><br/><p>\"I want some noodles with chicken.\" She craned her neck towards Qin Guan, making her voice clear enough for him to hear.</p><br/><p>\"What a sin!\"</p><br/><p>A Zi burst into laughter. She couldn't let that silly monk go. She pointed outside. \"Ah! I saw a monk passing by.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Where is he?\" Fooled by his simple brain, Qin Guan ran out of the door.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

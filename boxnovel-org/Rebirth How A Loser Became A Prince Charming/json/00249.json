The same process.\"</p><br/><p>The assistant had another question. \"We sent a sample fragrance for the Citizen photo album as a gift. Would it exceed the budget?\"</p><br/><p>Qu smiled. There was still a lot for the girl to learn.</p><br/><p>\"We will deduct it from the album. Plus, the advertisers asked for the gift. It was J Clothing, or something like that. They want to post an advertisement in our magazine, so that it can be released at the same time as Qin Guan's album. Too bad this is not our cup of tea. They should ask Rayli instead. 10,000 copies are not much for Asia anyway. China could swallow half of them up. Besides, Citizen will definitely publish an autographed copy later. It should be at the end of the year. They\u2019ll organize some kind of activity to take advantage of the increasing purchases.\"</p><br/><p>The assistant admired Qu very much. She retreated from the office silently to deliver her orders.</p><br/><p>Ms. Fu, with her preeminent statistical capacity, had an indistinct feeling that the Chief Editor really appreciated Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qu pick up the suit and pulled open the folding door of a tall yellow wooden cabinet beside her desk, which was filled with articles about Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>There were giant posters, newspaper clippings, photos, even the background for a racing festival. Qu hung the suit up among them and smiled with satisfaction. I have one more piece for my collection.</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan's photo album was silently put on shelves all around Asia.</p><br/><p>The biggest markets included the China mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. Nearly all top fashion magazines featured the album as an additional gift.</p><br/><p>The same scene was repeated in different areas.</p><br/><p>In China:</p><br/><p>\"15 yuan for VOGUE! There\u2019s an album as a gift. Have a look!\"</p><br/><p>Lao Zhang, the owner of the newsstand, actually paid for one. He looked through it page by page and then put it on the most prominent place on the shelf.</p><br/><p>He remembered Qin Guan. The boy would bring him a small fortune. He had recognized him at first glance when Xiao Wang had delivered the albums and the newspapers. He shamelessly took all the magazines from the five neighboring newsstands.</p><br/><p>A girl turned over two pages before she saw Qin Guan, the cover model of the first issue of VOGUE. As a loyal fan of the magazine, she would definitely buy it.</p><br/><p>Lao Zhang took 50 yuan from her happily and handed her two magazines, as well as a beautiful pocket-size basket with a 5 ml fragrance sample.</p><br/><p>\"Here\u2019s the gift!\"</p><br/><p>The girl accepted the gift with joy. When I get off work, I will drop by the fragrance shop. If the sample smells good, I may buy it.</p><br/><p>The sales volume the whole week made Lao Zhang happy.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, newsstand owners in Japan and South Korea took tough measures to sell the magazines.</p><br/><p>\"Why is this edition so expensive?\" Some girls hesitated by the shelves, looking at JJ and Rayli. \"It's for two magazines and an album. Look at the cover! That boy is so handsome...\"</p><br/><p>The two girls bought one magazine together. They would really regret that decision in the future. They would fight over the ownership of the magazine and become arch enemies.</p><br/><p>While the sales were carrying on silently, Wang Jingcao returned to her private office in W. Brother.</p><br/><p>Her actors were getting more and more, and she preferred to do all the work herself, no matter how important or trivial it was.</p><br/><p>Following her orders, her assistant had been waiting for that date for several days. Now he was ready to report to his director about the statistics.</p><br/><p>Wang touched the glass on her desk. The temperature of the water was just right. She looked at the smart young man in satisfaction. \"Tell me, Xu Chen. What are the results?\"</p><br/><p>Xu opened his big file and made a clear report, \"The amount distributed in Asia was limited to 10,000 copies, which were bought by 10 magazines. Half of them are in China, the main battlefield. The rest are divided equally according to the population of other countries.\"</p><br/><p>\"According to the statistics sent by our staff, the total sales on the first day reached 35%. At such a high speed, I believe they\u2019ll be sold out in less a week. Following your orders, I have sent the news to entertainment reporters in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. They sent back relative photos and material. I have entered everything into the company office system. Call me if you need anything.\"</p><br/><p>Then he put the file on Wang's desk, waiting for her next orders.</p><br/><p>Wang drank half the glass of water to soothe her dry throat. Then she nodded at her capable assistant, \"Good. Select the script for me. I\u2019ll call you if I need you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, madam!\"</p><br/><p>After he left, Wang turned on her computer to check out the data.</p><br/><p>In one of the photos, there was a classic Japanese house of a distinct Nagoya style. It was a characteristic teahouse.</p><br/><p>The owner was a gentle Japanese lady, and the shelves were filled with Qin Guan's albums.</p><br/><p>She had to be a crazy fan. Under the cover, there was a pink heart.</p><br/><p>The customers looked embarrassed. The lady refused to sell them the albums.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

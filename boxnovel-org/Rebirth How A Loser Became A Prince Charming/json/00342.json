They considered the style elegant and fashionable.</p><br/><p>Why had they made the autumn collection like that?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing high black army boots with brass buckles and loose silk pants. His jacket was even more dramatic. There were tactical pockets on his shoulders and chest, which was a symbol of the US special forces.</p><br/><p>The long-sleeved jacket was black, just like the pants, and reflected cold light under the lamplight. Qin Guan let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>The flourishing city of New York couldn\u2019t cover the residents\u2019 sorrow and wounds. War did not seem that far to ordinary people. Both the government and ordinary citizens were hesitant about the TIPS plan.</p><br/><p>The country focused on privacy and democracy, yet it was not completely against a plan that would make one million citizens spies of the government.</p><br/><p>This was because of the fear of terrorist attacks, as well as the economic downturn. After all, those who would be monitored were not American citizens.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to his senses and put on his outfit.</p><br/><p>After 10 hours of work, all the CK staff were annoyed. They were eager to enjoy the after-work parties, but they had to wait for the last interviewee. Qin Guan stepped into the room, walking neither too fast nor too slow.</p><br/><p>He was like a frozen sucker in the intense summer heat.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m here. Pay attention to me.</p><br/><p>The photographer, whose name was Mark, was a famous fashion expert in New York. He was tired from the hard work the interviews took, but Qin Guan's presence cheered him right up.</p><br/><p>\"Move! Move! This is the last series! Then we can get off work!\" Mark shouted at the stunned crowd. All of a sudden, everyone got busy working.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? Just perform. Don\u2019t pay attention to us. Just start anytime you like.\"</p><br/><p>The annoyed chief designer, whose name was Sam, finally stopped frowning. He actually hadn\u2019t been satisfied with the previous models. They had been too slender or too delicate. They would have been perfect for CK\u2019s original style, but that season\u2019s collection was different.</p><br/><p>According to the feedback of the marketing department, most Americans preferred a vigorous vibe. They liked dauntless, unyielding men. </p><br/><p>In general, they were fond of clothes that gave off a sense of security and could be used in an emergency.</p><br/><p>Office worker backpacks were larger than the previous year by thirty percent, and inner pockets were classified by different symbols.</p><br/><p>They put flashlights and ropes inside for an emergency, so the clothes had to meet the main demands of the market.</p><br/><p>Sam was now waiting for Qin Guan, the only model he had liked from the follow-up interviews, to show them his abilities.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, let's begin.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't waste their time. After speaking, he suddenly became a different person. He was no longer the same gentle guy, but a fierce, imposing man.</p><br/><p>Shining spears and armored horses,</p><br/><p>The symbol of war in ancient China.</p><br/><p>The general was fighting on the battlefield,</p><br/><p>He was the most commanding man there...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat on a simple folding chair, like a warrior sitting astride a horse. He looked powerful and mighty, as if he was facing enemies, like the ancient warriors thousands of years ago.</p><br/><p>The age of cold arms in China exceeded the imagination of Europeans, who used to fight with manure forks. Americans had an even more pitifully short history. Lacking any proper professional cultivation, Mark was stupefied, and so were the rest of the staff.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan stood up and pushed the chair aside. He strode over to the crowd with rhythmic steps. His slender legs looked straight in his black pants. His delicate face looked firm and persistent, and his distinct muscles seemed ready to conquer.</p><br/><p>Crack, crack.</p><br/><p>The clicks of mutton were the only sound in the silent room.</p><br/><p>Mark gradually calmed down when Qin Guan finished.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at the crowd in the dark. \"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>That's all? Mark looked at him in disappointment. Then he turned to Sam. Bro, once more?</p><br/><p>Sam's expression was hard to make out in the dark. \"Okay. Change out of the outfit and return it to the assistant.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan bowed before them again and walked away.</p><br/><p>When he left, Sam stopped pretending. All the staff was around him.</p><br/><p>\"Hurry! Show me the photos!\"</p><br/><p>Mark picked Qin Guan's photos out excitedly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

A Chinese accountant on Wall Street could only depend on himself.</p><br/><p>An old man with a poker face waved his hand around leisurely. \"It\u2019s better for you to know the current situation. You must know the high standards we set for our staff. If you spend 10 years here, I can promise you a senior management position.\"</p><br/><p>10 years to get to senior management. That\u2019s all you can offer me. Thanks a lot.</p><br/><p> \"Wait to hear from us again...\"</p><br/><p>They had a discussion and told Qin Guan he could leave.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up and bowed before them gently. Then he turned around and grinned at Marsha in secret. He left the room without looking back.</p><br/><p>The door was closed. They were still discussing Qin Guan\u2019s performance. Marsha was not as optimistic as they were though. That Asian boy doesn't see their firm as his final destination.</p><br/><p>Marsha knew that Qin Guan would never work at PWC. He had already shared his goal, which was to start his own firm.</p><br/><p>The sky above Wall Street was even darker than in other places, because the tall buildings and mansions there were very close to each other. Dream-pursuers could be seen everywhere, their hope evident in their busy steps.</p><br/><p>So many people became legends there, while so many others left empty-handed. Standing among the buildings, Qin Guan looked back at the street of the most flourishing economy in the US.</p><br/><p>A twisted vine was growing from the dirt by the roadside. It should have been climbing up the wall, but instead it was growing tenaciously on the ground.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a long breath to drive away all the negative feelings caused by the interview. If a plant can fight against its surroundings, I can surely find my own way.</p><br/><p>Ambition always came from a tough situation. Qin Guan left Wall Street without hesitation and headed to his happy nest with his briefcase.</p><br/><p>Let's return to the VOGUE headquarters now, where Richard and his arch enemy, Qu Xuemei, were staring at each other. She had resigned from her position as chief editor of VOGUE Asia and flown back to New York to apply for the same position as Richard.</p><br/><p>What the hell is this Chinese woman thinking about? During the general policy meeting that day, they nearly fought over the model selection.</p><br/><p>Of course Qin Guan has the potential to become popular, but VOGUE has already promoted Chad. We should take advantage of him to get more profit out of him.</p><br/><p>Why do you keep talking about sustainability, feasibility and development? Why do you insist on promoting Qin Guan and downplaying Chad? Are you kidding?</p><br/><p>Finally, Richard mustered all his courage and tried to oppose the terrible woman. \"In my opinion...\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay...\"</p><br/><p>His revolution was suppressed immediately. Then Qu made a horrific suggestion to their boss.</p><br/><p>\"According to my reliable source, Qin Guan has agreed to three covers and four inner pages with NYLON. That\u2019s an exclusive contract! The magazine started its business on cosmetics, but its sales volume is rising all over the country. Although it's nothing compared to us, in New York NYLON is already at second place. It has even surpassed W!\"</p><br/><p>\"If we don't make a countermove at once, in two months we\u2019ll have lost our throne in New York.\"</p><br/><p>Qu looked fiercely at Richard, the conservative chief editor. In her opinion, he was capable enough to defend their territory but not to explore a new domain. </p><br/><p>\"I know that we should consider our policy carefully. When a model is bringing money though, it's better to choose a conservative plan.\"</p><br/><p> \"There are many top brands in the world. Someone better than Chad is sure to appear someday. What will we do then?\"</p><br/><p>Before Richard could speak again, the woman made another suggestion he hadn\u2019t expected.</p><br/><p>\"Since we can't convince each other, let's make this a contest. We could organize a secret judge show for Qin Guan and Chad. We could invite W, Cosmopolitan, Harper\u2019s Bazaar and NYLON. We\u2019ll say that we want to express our appreciation for the kindness of these top brands.\"</p><br/><p>\"Raynana, who works for NYLON, has a hanging garden at the top of her building. There is a greenhouse with a one-way window there. The people inside cannot look outside, while the outsiders can see inside clearly.\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s the perfect place for a show. The people we will invite will be able to appreciate the grace of the two models.\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides, those two will appreciate our effort. No matter who wins, they will get a good chance to make profit and become famous. As for VOGUE, this is good promotion. I think the other bosses will also be interested in the plan.\"</p><br/><p>The boss pondered it. It seems like a good idea.</p><br/><p>Richard was shocked by Qu\u2019s openness. Instead of abusing her power, she had chosen to fight fair. I hear that there is a mysterious insect poison in China. She must be eating it...</p><br/><p>Qu was satisfied. This plan had many upsides and not a single downside for Qin Guan. He was a nobody in the fashion circle after all. If he took advantage of this chance, he could appear before the top brands in the US. He would be a winner, even if he lost the contest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Instead, I found the medicine drawer open. Two boxes of painkillers were missing. Chi might have taken them. That medicine was in case of an emergency.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt a little nervous. Painkillers were better than sleeping pills, but a large dose could be deadly. \"How many pills are there in one box?\" he asked.</p><br/><p>\"12. He took two boxes, so 24 pills.\"</p><br/><p>It was a large quantity. Qin Guan shouted at the others, \"Hurry up! Chi may be by the lake!\" They sped up and reached the lake, where they found Chi sitting in the pavilion by the bank. His head was leaning against a pillar, and the empty painkiller boxes were at his feet.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan rushed into the pavilion and asked him, \"Did you take the pills?\"</p><br/><p>Chi Hailin looked normal. \"Just did,\" he answered unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan relaxed and looked at Wang Lei behind him. Wang Lei understood. The two of them supported Chi from both sides.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan told Cong Nianwei, \"We\u2019ll take him to hospital so he can get professional treatment.\" Cong Nianwei nodded. She was a calm, good girl. She would never cause them any trouble.</p><br/><p>They took a taxi to the nearest hospital. In five minutes, they were at the second QH affiliated hospital. There were only doctors on duty at the ER at night. Qin Guan carried Chi into the emergency room without hesitation as Wang Lei ran to the registration office. Qin Guan explained everything to the doctor in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\"Chi Hailin, male, 19 years old, QH student. He took 24 painkillers seven minutes ago.\"</p><br/><p>The doctor checked his pupils with a small flashlight before waving his hand. \"Gastric lavage!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>When Chi Hailin walked out of the treatment room weakly, the doctor declared that he was fine, and they were all sent away. Qin Guan handed Chi the receipt. \"Keep it. Don\u2019t forget to return the money. Just give it to my girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Lei felt sympathy for Chi. Your enemy loves money. You are doomed.</p><br/><p>They took a taxi back and saw Cong Nianwei waiting by the entrance from afar. It was a September night, so it was not cold. If Cong Nianwei had suffered, Qin Guan would have made Chi pay.</p><br/><p>Her roommates were also around. Cong Nianwei asked Qin Guan worriedly, \"What's going on?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed. \"The doctor said he's okay.\" Cong Nianwei sneered and handed Qin Guan an empty package. Qin Guan took it and read carefully, \"XXX painkiller. The basis is XXX. The normal dosage is 12 pills a day...\"</p><br/><p>F*ck! Chi took 24 pills. What does that mean? It means that he had a cup of espresso without sugar and milk! He had played everyone! They had paid so much attention to a farce! Qin Guan walked up to Chi, rolled his sleeves up, and hit him in the stomach.</p><br/><p>Chi bent over and spit up some kind of liquid. Zhao Tianyi was angry. He supported Chi, shouting at Qin Guan, \"He has just had gastric lavage! Why are you beating him up?\" Qin Guan sneered and poked at Chi's head with the package. Zhao Tianyi thought that Qin Guan wanted to beat him, so he covered his friend\u2019s head unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan kept poking Chi's head. \"Why are you silent? Aren\u2019t you always angry with me? Why don\u2019t you say anything? Why don\u2019t you explain to your friend? Are you ashamed of what you did?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianyi put his hands down and asked curiously, \"Explain what to me?\"</p><br/><p>Chi had been lying to everyone. He smiled at Zhao shyly as he said, \"I just wanted to scare Cong Nianwei by taking pills, but there were only painkillers in our dormitory. I thought that they were not dangerous, but they would scare everyone. You left no time for me to express my feelings to Cong Nianwei before you took me away.\"</p><br/><p>He felt wronged. If everything had gone according to his plan, Cong Nianwei would have been shocked to tears by his life-risking actions. Then they would have exchanged heartfelt words and gotten together with everyone\u2019s blessing. He had even prepared a poem in honor of their love.</p><br/><p>\"Life is precious. The price for love is high. I wish to lose my freedom and life for you.\"</p><br/><p>Was it an impressive poem? Definitely not!</p><br/><p>Chi kept complaining, \"Before I could explain, we were at the hospital. The doctor was serious, and I was scared, so I agreed to the gastric lavage.\"</p><br/><p>Young man, the doctor thought you had taken powerful painkillers, not XXX painkillers.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Chi had suffered through the gastric lavage. (Has anybody here had gastric lavage? It\u2019s really painful!)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Cong Nianwei had occupied his mind completely. Grinning, he roared as everyone was looking at him, \"Cong Nianwei, I'm back!\"</p><br/><p>He had to roar, for there were plenty of trucks and machines around. No one would pay attention to his weak voice otherwise. The girl standing next to Cong Nianwei pulled at her sleeve.</p><br/><p>\"Isn't that your boyfriend? The award-winning actor?\"</p><br/><p>Yes, that's him. Could I just ignore him? Cong Nianwei let out a sigh, picked up something from a table and walked over to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing here? Put this on!\"</p><br/><p>It was a red safety helmet. Safety was a priority on construction sites.</p><br/><p>\"I just wanted to give you a romantic surprise. These flowers are for you!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei took the bouquet while Qin Guan put the helmet on. Cong Nianwei did not seem shy or happy, as Qin Guan had expected. Instead, she started lecturing him seriously.</p><br/><p>\"Next time, ask for a helmet at the entrance. Do you know how many deaths occur on construction sites? You will be the husband of an architect, so you should know all the regulations. Start studying them tonight.\"</p><br/><p>Is this the romantic encounter I was dreaming about?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. \"Thank you for your concern, darling. I'll study them carefully to avoid any similar mistakes.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had interrupted the team's conversation, so Cong Nianwei pulled him over guiltily to apologize to everyone. The easy-going head engineer waved at them.</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry about it. Our meeting was over anyway. We have a hard time on construction sites, but you have contributed a lot. We can have a break in the afternoon. Soon, the project will start and no one will be able to take any time off. Hold on, everyone!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone had already fled in every direction. Qin Guan drove away happily with Cong Nianwei. Cong Nianwei was really curious about the new car.</p><br/><p>\"If I knew the company would give you a new car, I wouldn't have bought the Land Rover!\" she complained as she looked around her.</p><br/><p>\"It doesn't matter. It's white, so you can't drive it to construction sites. The Land Rover is better for your job. You can carry all your blueprints and tools in it. Dust and dirt do not show as much on a black car.\"</p><br/><p>So she was going to use a luxury car as a forklift?</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei thought this was reasonable. When she came back to her senses, she realized that Qin Guan was driving in the wrong direction.</p><br/><p>\"Where are we going? That's not the way home!\"</p><br/><p>\"We are going to buy some houses!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a billionaire, so he liked checking out real estate prices. He was an investor though, not a real estate speculator, which made Cong Nianwei happy.</p><br/><p>The business street in Wanda Mall was almost complete. When it was ready, Qin Guan would become the richest real estate property owner on the East 2nd Ring.</p><br/><p>This was not the first time Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei would be buying a house together. They both made real estate agents nervous.</p><br/><p>After his experience on the construction site, Qin Guan looked dishevelled. There was dirt and dust on his white car and his leather shoes, and his gray suit looked like a dirty cleaning cloth.</p><br/><p>His suit was really expensive, yet his female companion was wearing a T-shirt, a vest with dozens of pockets and a pair of overalls. Is she a construction worker? Is she a real-life Cinderella?</p><br/><p>They both took a seat and asked to see some houses. The sales ladies recognized the couple right away. The man was the famous actor Qin Guan, so the girl drinking water had to be his official girlfriend!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

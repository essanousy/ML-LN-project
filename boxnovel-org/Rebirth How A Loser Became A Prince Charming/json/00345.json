Then he turned around to wait in line.</p><br/><p> A short-haired girl beside Lisa asked her curiously, \"Who's that? An Asian face is rare here! Do you know him?\"</p><br/><p> \"Not exactly.\" Lisa looked gloomy. He witnessed that awkward incident the other day. She was feeling perturbed and depressed.</p><br/><p> She didn\u2019t even know his name. They were not even acquaintances.</p><br/><p> The girl beside her kept asking questions. \"Wow! You like boys like that? I\u2019m worried about him. The old directors of the operational department will want to include an Asian face in such an important conference.\"</p><br/><p> \"Even if he passes the test though, he might still be weeded out at the fashion week...\"</p><br/><p> Lisa couldn't help but feel nervous for her savior, while the other girl, whose name was Veronica, grimaced disdainfully.</p><br/><p> \"No. E-116...\"</p><br/><p> When Qin Guan heard his number, he suddenly changed his attitude, which had attracted attention from the other models.</p><br/><p> He showed them the real power of the Asian model who had earned a place among them.</p><br/><p> As his army boots stomped on the floor, all the interviewers fixed their eyes on the approaching boy.</p><br/><p> The two senior managers of the operational department were shocked by Qin Guan and his outfit. They frowned slightly when they saw his skin clearly though.</p><br/><p> An Asian...</p><br/><p> They both remained silent. The two photographers had a completely different expression though. Sam was too excited to control himself. His fingers were constantly clicking on an imaginary button.</p><br/><p> The other photographer was Jones, the guy Qin Guan had met in the dark corridor. Apparently, one could never avoid their enemies.</p><br/><p> Jones recognized Qin Guan right away and became furious</p><br/><p> You dared mess with me! I\u2019ll pay you back. An eye for an eye...</p><br/><p> And that\u2019s exactly what he did. Smiling, he turned and told Douglas, the most old-fashioned man in the operational department, \"It seems that our brand is going along with the trend of globalization. I wonder if other brands of our level will have the same idea though.\"</p><br/><p> Douglas didn't say anything. He just folded his arms over his chest.</p><br/><p> Jones didn't get a response, so he backed off awkwardly.</p><br/><p> By that time, Qin Guan had gotten the approval of the tailoring designer, who had finished taking his measurements.</p><br/><p> It was time for the final test. The chief designer spoke up.</p><br/><p> \"Could you make time in your schedule for our conference? It\u2019s between November 5th and November 8th.\"</p><br/><p> \"No problem.\"</p><br/><p> \"You were this year\u2019s Asian Fashion Man and the first Asian male model on VOGUE's cover. Why did you decide to continue your career in New York?\"</p><br/><p> It seemed that they considered him a representative of the Asian continent.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan answered slowly, selecting his words carefully.</p><br/><p> \"Actually, I\u2019m a foreign student in New York. I\u2019m enthusiastic about the profession though, so I wanted to get a part-time job while I\u2019m studying.\"</p><br/><p> \"Oh?\"</p><br/><p> The interviewers seemed interested. Many girls and boys in the modelling circle started working at a very young age.</p><br/><p> Their goal was to become famous as early as possible. A foreign student engaging in modelling would spark their interest.</p><br/><p> \"Are you an undergraduate student?\"</p><br/><p> \"No, a postgraduate.\"</p><br/><p> \"At the State University of New York, the Municipal Academy of Arts or the Community College?\" </p><br/><p> This was an insult to the fashion circle, and it made everyone angry.</p><br/><p> Jones came back to his senses and realized what he had asked. He closed his mouth like a clam in an effort to protect himself.</p><br/><p> \"At the Finance Department of Columbia University...\"</p><br/><p> Are you kidding? You must have walked into the wrong interviewing room! Wall Street is north of here!</p><br/><p> Trying to remain serious, Douglas finally opened Qin Guan's file.</p><br/><p> \"Why don\u2019t I see this in your resume?\"</p><br/><p> \"According to the rules, I couldn\u2019t include any information irrelevant to the profession.\"</p><br/><p> \"Hmm, strict and modest. You are a true Columbia student.\"</p><br/><p> What do you mean? Was that a compliment?</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was confused when he saw Douglas hand the file to the chief designer.</p><br/><p> \"Not bad!\"</p><br/><p> The old men nodded together for the first time, which made the chief designer feel extremely flattered. Jones wisely remained silent.</p><br/><p> Wait and see, bastard. You\u2019ll really enjoy working with me.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan did not care about his malevolence. He was completely unashamed.</p><br/><p> After Qin Guan left, Douglas asked the chief designer to stay behind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

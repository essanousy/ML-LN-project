Those old firms might be unable to catch up with us. If Qin Guan's firm can make more profit for our hotel, we may use more flexible methods to deal with the other hotels as well. For example, we could divide the work among the other firms...\"</p><br/><p>The manager nearly burst into tears. My princess, stop! Our staff would suffer from the additional work. This is easier said than done, my dear...</p><br/><p>I have to accept her request. The old man indulges her. I\u2019ll give her a hotel. She can give it to that man as a gift.</p><br/><p>He looked sadly at Qin Guan, who was sitting beside him calmly. He remained silent, as if everything was in his hands. How can he be so confident?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confident thanks to the contents of his bag. The paperwork inside it showed that his profit rate was 3% higher than average. That was the best proof of his ability.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that the negotiation ended quickly, leaving him no time to show off.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he felt frustrated. Hilton was begging for approval with her eyes. I want to make a living on my talent and abilities, not my connections.</p><br/><p>Actually, he was the best example of someone making a living on their looks.</p><br/><p>With that thought in mind, Qin Guan told Paris Hilton goodbye. As he walked to the parking lot, he talked about everything with Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p> \"What happened to Hilton today? She usually tries to get close to me, but she didn\u2019t today. Am I less charming than I usually am?\"</p><br/><p>He caressed his face in a narcissistic manner. \"I shaved before we went out.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei started the car as she answered mysteriously, \"You\u2019ll see when we get home.\"</p><br/><p>See what?</p><br/><p>When they got home, Qin Guan found out that the family apartment across from theirs had been rented out to Paris Whitney Hilton.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei winked at him. \"I didn't want things to get out of control at that party. Hilton is obsessed with you. No one could stop her. The only way to wake her up would be to show her your true self. In my opinion, when she sees the real you, she will leave you alone... Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p> Hey, don\u2019t laugh at me like that!</p><br/><p> \"I made a deal with her. She will be able to get in touch with you and observe your everyday activities, and I will make profit for us. She sure beats Britney and Madonna with this wonderful opportunity she is giving us. I\u2019m really clever, aren\u2019t I?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan followed her upstairs gloomily. \"You are not afraid that her obsession for me might turn into crazy love? What if I fall for her?\"</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Cong Nianwei stopped. She turned around with flames in her eyes.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan could picture the keyboard waving at him.</p><br/><p> \"Can\u2019t you destroy your image a little? Besides, what girl would enjoy observing a couple every day? I bet that in one week the little princess will leave to try and save her dignity. As for me, I am very confident about myself. That's the best guarantee that my plan will succeed.\"</p><br/><p> \"So you will know what to do in the future?\"</p><br/><p> She opened the door as Qin Guan took her handbag apologetically. \"Sure! You are the boss...\"</p><br/><p> The lovers made good use of their final day of summer vacation. They were planning on lying on the couch all day. People eventually got tired of bustling parties, dark bars, and games. They just wanted to lie on the couch in their most comfortable pajamas and watch silly TV shows and entertainment programs.</p><br/><p> That day, the two couch potatoes watched a new TV program that showed the hidden sides of a strange industry in an unheard-of way. It was a \"talent show\". </p><br/><p> CW was an American television network co-funded by Warner Brothers and CBS Broadcasting Inc. The new network naturally couldn't compete with the ratings of the older networks all over the United States.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

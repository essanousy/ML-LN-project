The couples who had gotten their registration on the same day as Qin Guan felt much happier. They had gotten married on the same day at the same place. This was destiny.</p><br/><p>A young couple who had been planning on getting a divorce exchanged a glance and left silently.</p><br/><p>\"He got married today. If we parted now, it would bring him bad luck.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's exactly what I was thinking. See you tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you don't show up tomorrow, you'll be a loser!\"</p><br/><p>They seemed to get along well with each other.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei returned home and found their parents in Qin Guan's living room. When they showed them the certificates, Qin Guan's father handed him a key.</p><br/><p>\"What's this?\"</p><br/><p>\"The key to your marital house.\"</p><br/><p>\"But we have an apartment in Beijing.\"</p><br/><p>\"We talked about it and we prefer this city over Beijing. We'll live here until you have a baby. Our friends, neighbors and colleagues all live here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. You should have a place where you can stay together when you return for the next Spring Festival. The housing prices in our city are not that high. Don't forget the shares we bought thanks to your advice.\"</p><br/><p>\"Your father-in-law bought you a car. We have already tested it out.\"</p><br/><p>As he recalled the new black Audi parked under the building, Qin Guan was left speechless by their fathers' taste.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took the key and asked, \"Where is the house?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's a small villa over the Moon Bay!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Dad, you are really generous!\"</p><br/><p>Every time Qin Guan drove along Binhai Road, he would see a small villa with white walls and red roof tiles hidden among the trees. It was said that the owners were high-ranking officials who used it as a vacation home. Y City had plenty of fresh air, a really long beach, and lots of juicy fruit, including apples, pears, grapes, cherries and figs. Plus, the seafood there was amazing.</p><br/><p>Their parents must have used all their social connections to buy that villa. Their love for their children was that strong. Although they had gotten married and started their own business, they were still kids in their parents' eyes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan accepted their gifts calmly, just like their emotions.</p><br/><p>After their marriage, they would be considered adults. Thanks to their parents, they now had their own private home. When they reached the entrance of the villa, they realized it was unfurnished. There were only some fine decorations.</p><br/><p>That villa was different than the one they had in Beverly Hills. In the US, the owner of a mansion usually owned all the neighboring area. The houses around it were not desolate or uninhabited, but it was rarely that one saw a single person and one hardly ever visited one's neighbors.</p><br/><p>However, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei could now watch their neighbors' activities from their balcony. The villas were so close to each other that they could even see the clothes hanging on the balcony next to theirs.</p><br/><p>Their presence attracted their neighbors' attention.</p><br/><p>\"No. 7 has been sold!\"</p><br/><p>\"Seems like it. A young couple? Their parents must be rich.\"</p><br/><p>\"It must be their marital home. I saw the wedding decorations on the gate.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha! Only retired people would enjoy living here.\"</p><br/><p>The district was not new. Because of the nice location, it had actually been developed way back, so most of the owners were familiar with each other by now. The original owner of Qin Guan's villa had moved abroad. That was why their parents had been able to buy the villa.</p><br/><p>As a result, the neighbors were very curious about the newcomers. They were all rich, so they were concerned about their living environment. After some careful observation, the most clever of them noticed something strange.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

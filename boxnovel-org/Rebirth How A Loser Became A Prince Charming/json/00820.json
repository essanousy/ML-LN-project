It was time for Qin Guan to close his accounts.</p><br/><p>He had to make an evaluation of his total assets, so he arranged a short interview with the editor of \"Forbes Asia\" and sent a confirmation letter to \"The Times\".</p><br/><p>That would be all the work he had to do at the threshold of 2006.</p><br/><p>At the end of each year, \"The Times\" would typically select the 50 most beautiful ladies and 50 most handsome gentlemen from all over the world. It was not a strict selection, it was just meant to entertain the readers. The selection was based on looks, bearing, background and international influence.</p><br/><p>It was a tradition of the magazine, as well as a good method to promote sales. All the editors put their hearts and souls into the project.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's employees were confident about their boss. They were sure that he would be one of the top 50 men considering his looks and achievements.</p><br/><p>They didn't need to spend too much time on this, so they got busy working on the list and statistics for \"Forbes China\".</p><br/><p>The Forbes ranking lists had just entered China. There were currently two lists in sync with the global ones, the Forbes China Rich People List and the Forbes China Celebrity List.</p><br/><p>As the names suggested, the first one was for businessmen and the second one was for influential members of the Chinese entertainment and sports circle. Although they were in different fields, they had the exact same significance.</p><br/><p>Thus, Qin Guan's annual assets would be very important.</p><br/><p>Even though he was a professional accountant, Qin Guan was still shocked by his total assets. I have so much! The billionaire was caught off guard by his fortune.</p><br/><p>QC Group Accounting Firm: 17.35 million</p><br/><p>Entertainment Studio: 66 million</p><br/><p>Huayi Brothers Shares: 7.5 million</p><br/><p>Beauty Of The World: 3.3 million</p><br/><p>LESS/MORE Apparel Co. Ltd.: 13.5 million</p><br/><p>Personal fixed assets:</p><br/><p>Wanda Commercial Street: 9 million</p><br/><p>Apartment and Villa (China, United States): 6 million</p><br/><p>His total assets were worth approximately $130 million.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was now aware of his new identity as a billionaire. As for the celebrity list, he had no particular interest in it.</p><br/><p>He had made another investment on Ning Hao. In the spring, they would be working on \"Crazy Stone\". Everything was ready, when suddenly Wang's phone rang.</p><br/><p>After a short while, she hung up and showed Qin Guan her phone. The short message on the screen amused him.</p><br/><p>\"We would appreciate it if you contributed to the upcoming 2006 Spring Festival Gala.\"</p><br/><p>\"The suggested performances are as follows: sketches, crosstalk, singing and dancing, stage plays\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Request: The subject should promote socially positive energy\u2026\"</p><br/><p>It was an invitation from the organizing committee of the Spring Festival Gala. Qin Guan threw the phone back at Wang.</p><br/><p>\"No. I'm not a starlet eager for some fame. The relations between all sides are really complicated at CCTV. They have to protect the dignity of the senior actors. I'll just be wasting energy without earning anything in return.\"</p><br/><p>\"There are so many outstanding singers and dancers in China. I don't want to be teaching fish how to swim.\"</p><br/><p>\"What should I tell them then?\"</p><br/><p>\"Just ignore them. Tell them I'm busy. I'll find something to do so they have no reason to blame me. Oh, right. Tell Diamond that I'll do the poster!\"</p><br/><p>Less trouble and more profit!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took advantage of the situation to escape all the end-of-the-year business banquets and tiresome social responsibilities of the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>Sister Zhang was happy to receive a call from Wang Liying. Diamond had already taken care of the lawsuit with Tiffany over the traditional jade accessories and occidental jewellery.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, it was more difficult to hire Qin Guan as an ambassador, as he had established his own brand. Most fashion brands shrank back. According to the conventions of the fashion circle, perfumes, accessories and cosmetics were related to clothing.</p><br/><p>An ambitious man would turn his clothing brand into a group brand.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the jewellery industry was beyond the scope. There was no conflict between them, which explained Sister Zhang's confidence.</p><br/><p>Plus, jade and pearls only maximized their value in China.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

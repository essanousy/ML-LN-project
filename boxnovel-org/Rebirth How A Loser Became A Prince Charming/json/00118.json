Ye Dong hung up the last colorful lamps, thus completing the two-day event preparations.</p><br/><p>The next morning, as dew fell from slightly yellow leaves, the campus got more and more crowded.</p><br/><p>Posters had been arranged along the paths and the roads, and signs had been placed on the turns.</p><br/><p>Freshmen, as well as older students and teachers, had come to join in the fun of the leisurely weekend.</p><br/><p>One could find the mascot at the main entrance.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was distributing colorful balloons to students and teachers.</p><br/><p>The boys might have been ashamed by his childish presence, but they were satisfied by his warm, shining smile.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the cleverest one among them spoke.</p><br/><p>\"Is the mascot a sophomore?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"All the freshmen will go through the entrance, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"When the girls see him, will they consider him the standard for a boyfriend?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, no!\"</p><br/><p>The boys stood there with balloons in their hands and tears on their faces.</p><br/><p>Some staff from various clubs tried to encourage them, \"Don't worry. There will be some clubs willing to accept you.\"</p><br/><p>Do we look like hopeless losers?</p><br/><p>Students clustered around Qin Guan. Many girls hovered around him with their balloons, trying to find excuses to stay by the entrance.</p><br/><p>\"Don't push me! I\u2019ll fall!\" The girl pretended to fall and leaned against Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of the chaos, the girls tried to touch him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan realized that disaster was imminent and handed the balloons to a boy beside him, covering his head and escaping through a gap in the crowd.</p><br/><p>When he fixed his wrinkled sweater in the thickets, he saw the crowd form a circle. In the middle of it was the scapegoat, Li Jie.</p><br/><p>Li was interested in soft girls, not vigorous ones. He was hurt by the girls\u2019 words.</p><br/><p>\"Who is this? Where is the handsome senior?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea! It's like he changed magically.\"</p><br/><p>\"Tough luck! Let's go to the club. This is so annoying!\"</p><br/><p>They even rolled their eyes at poor Li Jie before leaving.</p><br/><p>When the chaos was over, Qin Guan ran up to Li Jie and asked him to distribute the balloons in his place. He was too afraid of causing a traffic jam again.</p><br/><p>Ye Dong waved at Qin Guan, who was hiding and watching the commotion, and gave him the Mu Lejiang Camping Club leaflets.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan understood immediately. He couldn\u2019t serve the public, but he could at least help out his friends.</p><br/><p>After taking several turns, he found Mu\u2019s camping club. Compared to the football and basketball clubs, it was a small club.</p><br/><p>A few tough-looking men were squatting in a deserted tent, looking like beggars. The tent was so shabby that it looked like a shed for barbarians.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was left speechless by their taste. \"Is this the extent of your promotion skills? Couldn\u2019t you take pictures of the places you\u2019ve travelled to?\" he tried to suggest.</p><br/><p>\"Try to find the most beautiful sceneries. Better get some wild animals too. Camping doesn\u2019t equal sleeping to you, does it?\"</p><br/><p>They were all enlightened. They were good at surviving natural disasters, but bad at advertising.</p><br/><p>As the poor guys stared at him, Qin Guan helped them attract freshmen.</p><br/><p>He rolled his sleeves up energetically and pulled Mu Lejiang away to hand out leaflets.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, this is information about our club.\" The boy already had a pile of leaflets in his hands that could be worth 0.2 yuan at a reclamation depot.</p><br/><p>He felt dizzy by the number of clubs and trembled when the senior approached him.</p><br/><p>He had a shining smile and gentle hands; the club had to be a good one.</p><br/><p>After Qin Guan left, the boy came to himself and read the material. It was a simple introduction titled, \"The Camping Club welcomes travel lovers!\"</p><br/><p>What a simple leaflet! I\u2019ll go, that senior convinced me.</p><br/><p>Not long after Qin Guan had left, the members of the camping club welcomed their new members.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

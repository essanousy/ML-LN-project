Every person sitting around that table was a bodyguard accompanying his boss. Only Han actually owned a security company.</p><br/><p>The man, who was renowned in Chinatown, felt jealous of the other professional security guards.</p><br/><p>\"Are you Qin Guan's bodyguard?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you know what his next film will be?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible. You are his bodyguard! He must trust you. Does this mean that you do not attend his meetings?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p> \"Why? Is he suspicious of you?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea.\"</p><br/><p>Ha! I finally got two words out of him. I'm so happy! Wait, I forgot about my boss!</p><br/><p>\"We are friends, right? Listen to me. My boss Brother Pan is a rich, powerful man. Investing in films is nothing for him. If your boss needs money, just call him!\"</p><br/><p>The man handed Han Zhujiu a business card with the words \"Investment Bank of He\" on it. When Han stuffed the card into his pocket, he smiled in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>A thin man with a bald head smiled scornfully at the Hong Kong bodyguards. Idiots! A man with a poker face is a sleeping tiger...</p><br/><p>Then he shot a glance at his own boss, only to see the wise man smiling like an idiot at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Forget it. My boss is only a man selling chicken fodder. Despite his large business, he still can't change his old habits. He is a patriot at heart. He got a role for his daughter so he could meet Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Even the Thai bodyguard knew what the outcome would be. His boss would entrust his business in China to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He was right. His boss, Xie Hanren, was a Chinese businessman stationed in Thailand. Unlike the others, he had gone there to support Chinese construction. His idea would be realized in China.</p><br/><p>Xie Hanren was the richest second-generation immigrant in Thailand. He was the real owner of the Lotus Center and possessed a 5% share of the Chia Tai Group. People could tell that his family loved China.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan received a large order from the three Chinese businessmen, so his accounting firm could finally get rid of its developing small-business model and receive an order from a larger company. Even medium accounting firms would look up to him now.</p><br/><p>QC had reached the standard of a medium accounting firm with an annual profit of billions of dollars overnight. This had saved Qin Guan two to three years of effort.</p><br/><p>All thanks to those patriotic Chinese businessmen.</p><br/><p>After they'd had their morning tea, they said goodbye to each other and parted ways. As Qin Guan was putting on his black suit, Wang Liying rushed over to him, looking completely out of breath.</p><br/><p>She had some news for Qin Guan. Chen Kexin had won the Best Foreign Film Award in Queens. Although it was not a well-known award in China, it was still a good beginning for the film.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fixed his suit and cheered himself up mentally. I wish myself the same luck tonight! Who could remain calm during the Oscar Opening Ceremony after all?</p><br/><p>\"Closer\" had won five Golden Globes, but Americans considered the Oscars way more important.</p><br/><p>Natalie Portman walked along the red carpet with Qin Guan. She had been nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, so the two young actors immediately attracted the attention of the reporters.</p><br/><p>There was no screaming or crazy behavior though, as there were many celebrities gathered around the red carpet. Everyone was dazzled by them, but Qin Guan would have rather attended the grand event incognito.</p><br/><p>After taking pictures with the tall golden figurine, he quickly hid among the stars in the waiting area, where the crew had gathered around the director. Everyone was talking to each other, but their minds were already in the auditorium, which was only 10 meters away.</p><br/><p>When the gate opened, everyone was asked to take their seats in the hall. Only when he sat down did Qin Guan notice the ingenuity of the seating arrangement.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

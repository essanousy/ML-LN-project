The little girl, who was glaring at them, seemed much weaker than Huang Jiajia without a man by her side.</p><br/><p>The girl was pointing at Huang Jiajia and shouting, \u201cI did step on you! So what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia's face was red. She looked completely pissed off, and she refused to back down. \u201cYou should apologize! You stepped on me three times, b*tch!\u201d</p><br/><p>A man behind the girl stepped forward. He moved away the girl\u2019s finger and winked at Huang Jiajia, acting as a peacemaker. \u201cLet it go. It's no big deal, right? Why bother fighting about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl got even more furious when she saw her boyfriend wink at Huang Jiajia. \u201cI picked a fight for you, you bastard! Your eyes have been all over this b*tch ever since you saw her! You even moved closer to her while you were dancing. How do you expect me to let it go?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he watched the girl glare at Hunag Jiajia, Qin Guan realized it was jealousy that had led to the fight. He dragged Huang Jiajia behind his back to get her away from the girl.</p><br/><p>The girl rolled up her sleeves. She had been about to pull Huang Jiajia\u2019s hair when she saw Qin Guan step in between them. Confused, she raised her head. All of a sudden, her arm paused in mid-air. She looked dumbfounded. The surrounding spectators had also gone silent.</p><br/><p>At the time, fighting was not a rare occurrence at clubs. Everyone loved to watch people fight. Whenever there was a fight, everyone would stop dancing just to watch.</p><br/><p>All the boys were thinking to themselves, \u201cWho sold this guy a ticket and let him in? Have you seen his looks and figure? How can I compete against him? Sh*t!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls, on the other hand, were thinking, \u201cHey, hottie! Look at me! I\u2019m much hotter than that little girl behind you. I have plump breasts and a slim waist. I can give you everything that you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security at the club stayed out of the fight. As long as there was no real fighting inside the club, they did not give a damn.</p><br/><p>Noticing that Qin Guan had attracted so much attention, the peacemaking man got jealous. He could not wait to vent his pent-up frustration. The man, whose nickname was Little Charmer, was quite well-known at the Landai Club. His good looks and bad-boy attitude made him really popular among the girls. This time though, Qin Guan had stolen his thunder.</p><br/><p>Little Charmer could not tolerate that. He looked at Qin Guan, who was obviously feeling out of place at the club, and said in an irritated tone, \u201cWe\u2019re all here to dance. Just forget about it, it's no big deal.\u201d It seemed that Little Charmer had totally forgotten about his initial intention to flirt with Huang Jiajia.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was about to answer when Huang Jiajia could not help yelling, \u201cWhat if I stepped on you? Would you be fine with that?\u201d Realizing that Huang Jiajia was not as weak as he had thought, Little Charmer got excited.</p><br/><p>Fighting between Beijingers was a lot of fun. People usually made an appointment with their opponents and spoke out their names respectively before the fight started. During a small-scale fight, if one party tried to make peace and the other party agreed, they would compromise and the fight would end. If the other party refused to do that though, then fighting would be inevitable.</p><br/><p>Little Charmer told Qin Guan enthusiastically, \u201cDamn, she\u2019s not backing down! Fine, I won\u2019t take advantage of you. Since we can\u2019t fight here, let\u2019s have a dance competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a frequent dancer at the club, Little Charmer knew that Qin Guan was not a regular there. He was pretty confident that he could win. He was actually planning on humiliating Qin Guan with his dancing abilities.</p><br/><p>Some spectators were jeering at Little Charmer while others looked jealous of him. They were all urging him on, \u201cGo! Be a man! Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she saw the eager crowd, Huang Jiajia felt a little worried. She tagged at Qin Guan\u2019s sleeve and whispered, \u201cLet it go, Qin Guan. You can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not answer. He undid another button on his shirt, rolled up his sleeves, and asked Little Charmer, \u201cWho goes first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Charmer was stupefied. After a while, he pouted at Qin Guan and then looked at the two stages. \u201cTogether,\u201d he replied. \u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Having watched the scene, the club manager played a faster song and the leading dancer walked down from the stage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Little Charmer walked to each of the two stages. The spectators shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s dance!\u201d and started dancing to the song.</p><br/><p>Little Charmer joined the crowd, starting to dance right away. To be frank, he was a very good dancer. The crowd shouted \u201cBravo\u201d at him repeatedly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was taking his time. He took out a fluorescent spray from Huang Jiajia\u2019s handbag and sprayed some to his front and back. Suddenly, his perfect figure shined under the dim lights, making up for his simple outfit.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put down the spray. He had not even started dancing yet, but all the girls had already surrounded his stage and were screaming over his attractive body.</p><br/><p>The first part of the song was finished, and the second part began. Qin Guan started to dance. He raised his hands up and snapped his fingers. His hips moved, and his shoulders, legs and feet followed. One move after the other, Qin Guan danced faster and faster to the song.</p><br/><p>The crowd went crazy in an instant. Everyone started screaming. In the dim yellow light, all everyone could see Qin Quan's fluorescent body dancing to the rhythm.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was just as good as Little Charmer. His various moves coordinated perfectly with the music.</p><br/><p>Anyone could tell who was the better dancer. Qin Guan danced as gracefully as a knight while Little Charmer danced like a mad idiot.</p><br/><p>As he saw Qin Guan\u2019s beautiful moves, Little Charmer stopped dancing. Gnashing his teeth, he walked down from the stage and dragged his girlfriend behind him as he exited the club.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went on dancing until the song ended. His forehead was wet with sweat. \u201cBravo!\u201d he heard the crowd shouting. Satisfied, he walked down from the stage and went up to the bar to have a mouthful of cold beer.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat down by the counter to take a break. He had experienced the preciousness of youth during that hot dance and he knew that this lifestyle was not for him, although he did enjoy it occasionally.</p><br/><p>As he rested, the manager played a slow song. The people who had not been satisfied by the former hot dance started to dance cheek-to-cheek with their partners.</p><br/><p>After dancing to their heart's content, Huang Jiajia and the other two girls walked up to Qin Guan and asked for three cans of cola. Qin Guan took a look at his watch and realized that it was already 10 p.m. \u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d he told Huang Jiajia. \u201cLet\u2019s call it a day, alright?\u201d Before Huang Jiajia could protest, Qin Guan went on to say, \u201cMay I dance with you? We need to talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realizing that Qin Guan was serious, Huang Jiajia nodded and walked to the dance floor with him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put his hands on Huang Jiajia\u2019s waist and asked her to follow his lead. While they danced, he said, \u201cIs there something you want to say to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia looked at Qin Guan innocently. \u201cOh, you mean about tonight? Wow, you were just amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan slowly said to her, \u201cYou\u2019re still a high school student. I really hope that you won\u2019t come here anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia did not answer. She wanted to move closer to Qin Guan, but he pulled a dance move to avoid her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you keep fooling around, then I think my job as a tutor is done. Now you have to go back home,\u201d Qin Guan said. Huang Jiajia had not had enough time to figure out what was going on when Qin Guan dragged her off the dance floor and told the other two girls, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, I have to go. Let\u2019s call it a day. You have to take Huang Jiajia home.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three girls were terrified of Qin Guan. They just nodded and walked out of the club with him. Qin Guan walked them to the street, intending to get a cab to take them home.</p><br/><p>As they were waiting for the cab, a group of people suddenly came over. Qin Guan saw Little Charmer walking in front. He had been waiting for Qin Guan outside for a long time. After being humiliated that night, he had called in all his friends in the area to teach Qin Guan a lesson.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and the girls were led into a small alley near the club, where a man was squatting down on the ground smoking.</p><br/><p>When they entered the alley, Little Charmer\u2019s friends gathered behind him. The girls were too frightened to say anything. They dragged at Qin Guan\u2019s sleeves as they looked at the guys in front of them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not panic. If these people had been from Northwest China, he would have already fled with the girls, but since they were just Beijingers, he thought he could give it a shot.</p><br/><p>Little Charmer stared at Qin Guan and yelled at him arrogantly, \u201cYou bastard! You kept me waiting for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed deeply with a straight face before he said, \u201cIn accordance with Act 160 of the Criminal Law of 1979, anyone who gathers a crowd with the intention of fighting, picks up a fight, insults women, or carries out any other immoral activities that disrupt public order, shall be convicted to fixed-term imprisonment of no more than seven years, be arrested, or be put under surveillance.\u201d He panted for breath as he added, \u201cChasing, intercepting, abusing or threatening other people is considered equal to picking a fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Charmer looked at Qin Guan as if he was dumb. \u201cYou idiot! You\u2026\u201d Before he could finish his words, the man smoking in the alley started choking from laughter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

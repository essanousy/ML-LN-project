He had taken plenty of pictures in secret.</p><br/><p> Turning around, he hummed a Peking Opera song happily.</p><br/><p> \"I'll rush over and kill them all...\"</p><br/><p> Did he think he was a hero who had fought against Japanese invaders?</p><br/><p> The bus was filled with joy. As a rich man, Qin Guan had promised everyone a big meal after he was done with work. That was his way of expressing his gratitude.</p><br/><p> He couldn't choose a small restaurant, so in the end he picked Jun Wang Fu...</p><br/><p> When the group dispersed, Qin Guan regretted showing off.</p><br/><p> \"Wei, shall we hold our wedding banquet here? We could pay for it with the cash we'll get as a wedding gift.\"</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei was unpacking her luggage without looking at him. \"Our parents will arrive tomorrow. The house is too small.\"</p><br/><p> \"You are right. When my job here is over, we'll buy a larger one together. We are local royalty after all. Tomorrow, we'll separate and take care of our affairs.\"</p><br/><p> \"I'm hungry...\"</p><br/><p> They had both missed the food of their motherland. Chinese restaurants in America were not right for Chinese people.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan rushed to the Hu Guo Si snack bar, shouting happily.</p><br/><p> It was the most famous snack bar chain in Beijing. It sold dozens of Beijing snacks while preserving tradition. The taste of the food had remained the same throughout the years.</p><br/><p> It was great to be back home.</p><br/><p> Sesame paste, cooked sheep or swine tripe, handmade noodles... The young couple gorged themselves on the delicacies, making the other customers smile knowingly.</p><br/><p> Love and happiness were in the air.</p><br/><p> Refreshed by the delicious food, Qin Guan was in high spirits when he met Sister Xue at the \"Chinese Impression\" media conference. When they reached the site of the ceremony, they noticed that the place looked very solemn.</p><br/><p> There were no media or fashion insiders. The people there were very strange.</p><br/><p>They looked like they did not engage in movies, but in conferences.</p><br/><p> When he was led to the area reserved for actors, Qin Guan found the few actors there sitting in a corner.</p><br/><p> Interesting! Actors had to play a leading role at such an event.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan began to talk to the others.</p><br/><p> \"Hello! May I have the honor of knowing your name?\" I have no idea who that old man is. Is he an old actor?</p><br/><p> \"Nice to meet you, I'm a jade sculptor.\"</p><br/><p> \"I'm a dancer of the Central National Dance Troupe.\"</p><br/><p> There was no actor there except Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Only when the media conference began did Qin Guan spot Director Zhang Yimou. The man looked helpless.</p><br/><p> The long table on the stage made the event seem like an important national conference. The director of the film was sitting at the end of the table.</p><br/><p> A kind old man knocked on the microphone, indicating that the conference was about to begin.</p><br/><p> The officers from the Olympic Sports Center delivered a 10-minute speech about the significance of sports spirit.</p><br/><p> The Ministry of Culture attached great importance to the film.</p><br/><p> The National Tourism Administration wanted to promote a cultural tourism image at an international scale.</p><br/><p> The Palace Museum would just carry out the tasks assigned to it by its superior leaders.</p><br/><p> The Administration Office of Beihai Park would make sure that the site would be clear during the shooting.</p><br/><p> The Temple of Heaven Park would cooperate with the crew without influencing the flow of tourists.</p><br/><p> The neighborhood committee of Legation Street...</p><br/><p> Hey! This is just a short film...</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was getting sleepy in his chair. Suddenly, a deafening applause broke out. After an hour and a half, the conference had finally come to an end.</p><br/><p> Satisfied with the progress, the directors left with their hands at their backs as their secretaries and assistants carried thick piles of paperwork.</p><br/><p> The actors exchanged confused looks.</p><br/><p> \"What are you doing, Qin Guan? You are an experienced actor. You will have a lot of responsibilities in the future.\"</p><br/><p> \"What?\"</p><br/><p> \"What do you mean 'what'? Follow me!\"</p><br/><p> \"Okay...\" You are the boss.</p><br/><p> Several shabby minibuses pulled up next to them, some greenhands spontaneously clustering around Qin Guan. Everyone got on the buses.</p><br/><p> The short documentary, which would be titled \"Chinese Stamp: Dancing in Beijing\", would serve as a connecting link between the previous and the next Olympics. It would have to impress not just the Chinese people, but an international audience.</p><br/><p> Naturally, Zhang Yimou had the financial and human resources support of the government.</p><br/><p> For example, the administration office of the park would take care of crowd control around the shooting site and the staff would ask the tourists to steer clear of the location.</p><br/><p> The shooting site was actually a wharf made of bamboos, with a mist lingering above it and a stream flowing around it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

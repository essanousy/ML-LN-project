She added another stab to Ou Qiang\u2019s heart. \"Maybe I\u2019m too old, but someone told me he\u2019s stayed in there for a really long time, which is a good thing. My Qin Guan has been in that chamber for four minutes. Why isn\u2019t he coming out?\"</p><br/><p>Ou Qiang felt extremely flattered, as Sister Xue had started the conversation. He was as tame as a little puppy. Ouyang Fen was so angry that his nose was twisted in a grimace.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan is an invincible opponent. I stayed in there for three minutes, but he must have been inside for four. Maybe he\u2019s pooping and can't find the toilet paper! Ouyang Fen was making malevolent scenarios, when Qin Guan finally came out. You f*cking provoker!</p><br/><p>Sister Xue made place on the couch for Qin Guan happily as she asked, \"How did your interview go?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shrugged proudly and sat down. \"The results will be announced soon. In my experience, I don\u2019t think you made it, Ouyang Fen. Ha ha ha...\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was listening carefully to Qin Guan, when his style suddenly changed from calm to annoying. As the four of them (except Ouyang Fen) were talking and laughing, the assistant came out and made an announcement.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks again for your support of the SS Group. Now I would like to announce the results of the interviews. Here are the models we are interested in. XXX, XX, XXX, Ouyang Fen, and Qin Guan. The aforementioned models will have to wait for a while for an introduction to the show. We hope to have the opportunity to cooperate with the rest of you another time.\"</p><br/><p>Noise prevailed as most people left in a rush. The assistant gave notices to everyone. Sister Xue and Qin Guan read theirs carefully and found out that the first rehearsal would be that Wednesday. It would be the last adjustment before the show, as the formal launching event would take place that Saturday.</p><br/><p>The show Qin Guan would be participating in featured western-style clothes of the SS Group, which was the most important collection. There would be 28 models in the formal show. Therefore, the model chosen for the main show would be kept a secret for suspense.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qin Guan returned to college with the notice as soon as possible, as Qin Guan was hungry. It was late in the afternoon, and he hadn\u2019t had lunch yet. When he returned to college, he swallowed his lunch in one sitting in his dormitory.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia and Mou Xiaoliu had become good friends. Their common interest in Qin Guan and the lunch they\u2019d had together had narrowed the distance between them. Huang Jiajia thought that Mou was a silly bear that had to be protected with care, while Mou thought that Huang Jiajia was a troublemaker whom she had to look after. The two girls walked together hand in hand. They later became the senior and the legend among Qin Guan's fan club.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia expressed her great interest in Mou Xiaoliu\u2019s night part-time job, which was agreeable to her taste. As a bad girl who knew her way around night entertainment venues, she was wondering why the silly bear would get such a job. Mou Xiaoliu had no idea what the job was. She had just chosen it because it paid well. She had seen the advertisement at college and thought it would be okay for a student.</p><br/><p>It was 20:00 at night. The colorful neon lights were shining along Sanlitun Street, where the bars were flourishing. Another crazy night had begun. Urbanites went out to relax, young men went on romantic dates, and fribbles gathered there for crazy feasts.</p><br/><p>The morning there began at 8:00 pm. The bars opened, but the warm-up singers did not show up. They were still asleep in their beds. The large lamps were lit one by one, indicating that the crazy feast was about to begin.</p><br/><p>Mou Xiaoliu felt crazy in her mini skirt, which she had never worn before. She had been asked to change into a short skirt by her superior, and she had gone to the washing room with a silly expression. Huang Jiajia burst into laughter behind her. She had made up a story for her mother and followed Mou Xiaoliu there.The silly bear has no idea how life is at bars. As a frequent visitor, I have to protect her. (Darling, you were not a frequent visitor, okay?)</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia's eyes opened wide when Mou came out of the washing room. She must be a D+ cup!</p><br/><p>Mou\u2019s full breasts and round butt made the beer girl uniform look sexy on her. Looking down at her own A+ cup, Huang Jiajia wrinkled her nose, scanning Mou with jealousy.</p><br/><p>\"I didn't know you had such a nice figure. Why do you wear loose clothes? It's a pity!\"</p><br/><p>Mou Xiaoliu pulled at her tight blouse, murmuring, \"These clothes are not for humans! Why do beer girls have to dress like this?\"</p><br/><p>Distracted, Huang Jiajia answered unconsciously, \"To increase the sales volume probably. Beer drinkers are mostly male. Actually, even ladies would like to buy beer from you.\"</p><br/><p>She stretched out her hands unconsciously.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Let me know before you get in!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha! You want me to announce myself before getting in! If it wasn\u2019t for your assistant, there would have been another person in your room yesterday. You may have gotten even more scared!\" Wang patted the table with her hand.</p><br/><p>Hu Jun was still in a daze. \"Watch your hand, sister. Does it hurt?\" he asked.</p><br/><p>Wang didn't know what to say. She burst into laughter at the hairy man\u2019s words. \"You are an adult yourself. I know you well. Don't let your hormones control you! Learn from Qin Guan. Hold yourself back, okay?\"</p><br/><p>Hu was surprised to hear Qin Guan's name from his agent.</p><br/><p>\"I know him, Sister Wang. He is an honest, handsome guy. I didn't see the extreme beauty that you mentioned though.\"</p><br/><p>A video of Qin Guan on the show automatically emerged in Wang's mind. The boy was holding his elegance back for the show. Only on the T stage did he bloom open like a flower.</p><br/><p>\"Stop that rubbish! We are talking about you now...\"</p><br/><p>Hu Jun, who usually acted like a mature person, was listening to her like a pupil as the rest of the crew was carrying on with their work.</p><br/><p>The towering Diancang Mountain was covered by accumulating snow the whole year. The snow was glittering under the clear sky.</p><br/><p>The surface of Erhai Lake was as limpid as a mirror. The moonlight shone against the waves as fishing boats returned home in the evening, singing fishing songs.</p><br/><p>The beautiful scene matched the beautiful actors perfectly. The audience enjoyed their beauty as the crew suffered silently.</p><br/><p>They had to climb the steep hill while carrying heavy equipment, looking for the right place for it.</p><br/><p>A lot of scenes took place on that hill. Li Qiusui, the main villain, appeared and Xuzhu murdered him there. He killed the master of an island in order to save someone.</p><br/><p>The whole crew suffered during that short scene. They had to find pine cones, as they were an important element for that scene. In their spare time, they dag everywhere in hopes of discovering dried, beautiful pinecones.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the squirrels had stocked food for winter. Otherwise, they would have been short of pinecones that year.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to get up at nightfall and work overnight under the light of torches.</p><br/><p>Then they had several hours of rest. After hard work and concentrated effort, they finished all the mountain scenes.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the base, Huang got excited. He knew what the following scenes were. The whole crew was waiting for the exciting love scene.</p><br/><p>Who was in it? Qin Guan, of course! His partner, the Princess of Xixia, had joined them two days earlier. She was waiting for her dream lover at the base of the hill.</p><br/><p>They enriched their experience with an icehouse, which had been built by the prop team overnight. Ice blocks were piled inside the room. It looked splendid!</p><br/><p>All the crew members and actors were doing their jobs. They were all annoyed by something though.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang saw it, but he didn't express his opinion. He just looked at Qin Guan with a smile, without telling him anything.</p><br/><p>It was a nice day. Qin Guan was led to the other side of the set. Director Zhang came over to meet him, which was strange. He sized Qin Guan up for a long time before he said, \"Are you clear about the scene today?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. There is only one line in my script, \u2018Hugging tightly on the bed\u2019. Shall I just act freely?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang shook his head. \"No, just follow my instructions.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan relaxed. That will save me some energy.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Director Zhang asked him, \"Did you have any garlic at breakfast?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\" Zhang left guiltily. Qin Guan scratched his head. Is there any connection between garlic and the erotic scene we are filming?</p><br/><p>All idlers cleared away, except the women and some important crew members and cameramen.</p><br/><p>\"Ready?\" An actress wrapped in a coarse grey cloth walked in slowly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was sitting on the stone bed with his legs crossed, realized that he knew the girl.</p><br/><p>It was Liu Jia, the girl he had helped on the red carpet. Qin Guan smiled. Little did he realize that his smile was fatal.</p><br/><p>His charm was suddenly revealed to everyone. They were all caught unprepared.</p><br/><p>His shabby gown couldn't cover his elegance.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia, who had been preparing for a long time before entering the set, was struck by his beautiful smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

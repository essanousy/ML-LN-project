She sorted Qin Guan's resume and put it into a file.</p><br/><p> With professional sensitiveness, she gathered the best resumes.</p><br/><p> Any time she saw a new face in an Armani show, she would check in her files. If she found their original resume there, she would get happy.</p><br/><p> She pressed the button and the HR assistant came to collect the resumes. She frowned at the man, who was the most difficult to get along with in the company. His name was Jimmy, and he was a strange, mean man. Most of the staff disliked him.</p><br/><p> He walked up to the resume boxes with a disgusted expression and dropped all the sorted files into a large case he had brought.</p><br/><p> \"That's all? Honestly, you should clean the shelves. There\u2019s too much dust.\"</p><br/><p> He raised his eyebrows angrily and patted his clothes. Keeping her temper in check, Emily handed him Qin Guan's file.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019ll clean them later. This is another model\u2019s resume. The best of the day, in my opinion. That\u2019s why I singled it out.\"</p><br/><p> Opening his eyes wide, Jimmy screamed dramatically, \"Wow! This is the job of the HR department. When did the receptionist start doing it?\"</p><br/><p> \"Besides...\" He cast a mocking glance at the cover. \"An Asian model? Darling, your job is to clean. You have no idea about the concept or the function of our company.</p><br/><p> \"An Asian model? Armani would become a laughing stock in the New York Fashion Week! Just mind your own business!\"</p><br/><p> He put Qin Guan's resume in his case like it was rubbish and sneered at the girl before he left.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan had no idea about that. He had decided on the first brand he would be interviewing for. It was Hollister in SOHO.</p><br/><p> The brand aimed at young people between the ages of 15 and 25, and sold casual clothes. It was associated with AF, but its low prices attracted customers of all kinds. One could see both young girls and older women wearing their clothes on crowded streets.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan went into a Hollister store and sighed in relief. He got almost the same feeling as being in Beijing. The brand originated from South California. In their flagship store there, they put two handsome, half-naked guys by the entrance to attract customers.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan couldn't imagine having to accept such a job. If Chinese visitors took photos of him and brought them back home, he would die of embarrassment.</p><br/><p> Fortunately, this was New York. In the dim store, a sales assistant led him to the storage room behind the store, where Mary, a designer visiting the stores and getting customer feedback, was waiting for him.</p><br/><p> She was in New York especially to meet Qin Guan, the Chinese model who worked for LEE. Qin Guan had gotten in touch with her in advance.</p><br/><p> Mary watched Qin Guan walk up to her gracefully in the dim light. Suddenly, she got the same feeling the LEE designer had.</p><br/><p> That model was perfect.</p><br/><p> Before Qin Guan could even take out his resume, Mary said, \"Would you like to go to California with me? We need talented models like you.\"</p><br/><p> \"No!\" Qin Guan shook his head.</p><br/><p> Mary looked disappointed.</p><br/><p> \"Okay, let me see. This is a small room, but it\u2019s enough for two rounds. Could you please try on some of our clothes here? Weenie, find me NO.5526, 1123 and 999. Size L.\"</p><br/><p> \"Got it!\" Weenie dag up the clothes easily.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan changed in a small fitting room.</p><br/><p> Xu Xiaoxiao was in the front of the store, watching the customers shuttling back and forth. There\u2019s so many girls here!</p><br/><p> The door of the storage room was opened. \"Here. This space should be enough.\"</p><br/><p> The designer pointed to the space before the counter with shining eyes. Qin Guan walked between the shelves as if he was on the T stage.</p><br/><p> He was wearing skinny jeans, flip flops and a simple blue-white striped shirt.</p><br/><p> It was not a popular outfit for busy office workers in New York, but it looked very comfortable on Qin Guan's body.</p><br/><p> The broad stripes looked fashionable, the flip flops were wonderful for the torrid summer, and the jeans looked sexy on his slender legs.</p><br/><p> A girl passing by holding shopping bags fixed her eyes on Qin Guan. She hit her head on the glass door hard.</p><br/><p> Nobody laughed at the poor girl. They were all stunned, the clothes in their hands dropping to the floor.</p><br/><p> Xu took a deep breath to refresh his brain.</p><br/><p> An old woman standing beside him nearly fainted.</p><br/><p> \"Okay!\" Mary clapped, breaking the silence.</p><br/><p> \"Qin Guan, follow me!\" she said, waving at Qin Guan. They disappeared behind the small door.</p><br/><p> The onlookers\u2019 view was blocked by the door. Coming back to their senses, they all started taking action one after the other.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

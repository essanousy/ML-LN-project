The girl had to be very excited. She stood still, as if she was petrified.</p><br/><p>\"Can I shake hands with you?\" Qin Guan kindly tried to save her from embarrassment and stretched his hand out to her.</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\" The girl came back to her senses like a hungry tiger seizing its prey.</p><br/><p>The fans behind her cast disdainful glances at her as she was led to the back hall like drunk. What a shame!</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I like you so much! May I shake hands with you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Me, too!\"</p><br/><p>\"Me, too!\"</p><br/><p>Where is your dignity?</p><br/><p>The autograph copy sale was finished in half an hour. Qin Guan looked up and fell into an awkward silence.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you here? You have seen me plenty of times at college!\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia put her hands on her hips. \"This is discrimination! Stop talking rubbish and give me an autograph!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned his eyes to Mou Xiaoliu helplessly. Why is such a good girl like you with her?</p><br/><p>Mou also felt wronged. You didn't give us an autograph, although we\u2019ve known each other for a long time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gave in. Just before his pen touched the paper though, Huang Jiajia stopped him. \"Don\u2019t mess with us. I want my own personalized signature.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at Sister Xue, who pointed to her watch and nodded. Time is pressing. Just do it.</p><br/><p>\"What do you want me to write?\" Qin Guan asked them.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia pointed to herself. \"For my favorite student, Huang Jiajia.\"</p><br/><p>Then she pointed to Mou. \"For my purest schoolmate, Mou Xiaoliu.\"</p><br/><p>That's unfair. Mou is just my schoolmate?</p><br/><p>Mou Xiaoliu was satisfied though. I\u2019m different from his ordinary fans anyway.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished their autographs as soon as possible and went to the back hall, where he would interact with fans for 10 minutes according to the schedule.</p><br/><p>His job was simple. All he had to do was cooperate with the host and interpreter. Guo Yannuo, the interpreter, was waiting for Qin Guan to arrive. He was a cunning guy, but Sister Xue had invited him because he spoke several Asian languages.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was lively. The host, Qin Guan and the fans were talking happily. In 10 minutes, the fans learned a lot more about their idol.</p><br/><p>For example, they discovered that Qin Guan's favorite color was black, he loved delicious food and he was a straight-A student. He seemed like an easy-going guy.</p><br/><p>Finally, it was time for the lucky turn plate. The luckiest fans would get to ask their idol private questions.</p><br/><p>The game made everyone excited.</p><br/><p>They were looking at the turn plate on the screen nervously. Qin Guan shouted \"stop\" with his back to the screen. Then the lucky fan was selected.</p><br/><p>It was No. 99, Huang Jiajia\u2019s number.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fell silent.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue knew him well. Although she wasn\u2019t clear about the situation, she sensed Qin Guan's hesitation.</p><br/><p>Smiling, the host walked up to Huang Jiajia. \"Congratulations to the lucky girl. How are you feeling right now?\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia gave him a splendid smile. \"Excellent!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan swallowed his saliva.</p><br/><p>The host went on, \"This is an exciting moment. What question will you ask your idol? It's time to hear his honest answer. He will answer any question you want.\" All the fans were jealous of Huang Jiajia. If only I had that chance!</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia opened her mouth as cold sweat formed on Qin Guan's forehead. I\u2019m going to pay now...</p><br/><p>\"I have a question...\"</p><br/><p>Stop panting and just spit it out. Qin Guan was thinking about countermeasures in his mind.</p><br/><p>\"Can I still love you?\"</p><br/><p>Guo Yannuo was a professional interpreter, so he translated the question into several foreign languages literally.</p><br/><p>What? We all love him! Is this even a proper question? You are wasting a precious chance! The other fans felt pity for her.</p><br/><p>\"You could at least ask what kind of girls he likes, or if he has an official girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p>\"Even his future plans would be okay.\"</p><br/><p>There were only three people on site who understood the question: Qin Guan, Huang Jiajia and Mou Xiaoliu.</p><br/><p>Mou looked at Huang Jiajia in surprise. Two years had passed, and Senior Qin was about to graduate. Huang Jiajia was way more mature than she used to be, but she was still stuck on Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Two years were too short for a girl\u2019s feelings to go away.</p><br/><p>The host, on the other hand, felt glad for Qin Guan. That girl was definitely a loyal fan. She han't asked an awkward question. She had been afraid that fans would inquire about something more private.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

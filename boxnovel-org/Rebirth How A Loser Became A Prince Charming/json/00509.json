You had a really long vacation. Back to work now!\"</p><br/><p>\"You have three jobs in Los Angeles. One is a film called \u2018Mean Girls\u2019, the second is an MTV show a singer has invited you to personally, and the last one is an advertisement. Cheers, young man! This night will be your last chance to relax!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to die. The blue sky and green water did not seem as beautiful anymore. \"Sister, I am not your slave. Time is swift. I want to enjoy myself!\"</p><br/><p>\"The advertisement is for a Cadillac SUV. It will go global, actually. The salary is three million dollars...\"</p><br/><p>\"Just tell me when and where. Time is swift. I want to work to death!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan changed his attitude at once. Meanwhile, Vivian experienced the first success of her career.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, I\u2019m the editor of \u2018Humans &amp; Geography\u2019. I\u2019m interested in your posts on OMG. Can we talk privately?\"</p><br/><p>Thanks to Qin Guan, a real-time broadcasting program on the fun life of celebrities was about to start. It was a delightful change brought about by the Asian boy.</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan left the group to go to work. His loyal fans watched him go reluctantly. Following the advertisement shooting team, Qin Guan stepped on a steep hill path on the West Coast.</p><br/><p>The sea was on his left, and rocks were on his right. The cliff was above him, while perilous peaks and pines were below him.</p><br/><p>On that sparsely populated but extremely beautiful site, Cadillac would shoot an advertisement for its latest SUV.</p><br/><p>Taking into account the demands of Chinese customers, whose purchasing power had been rising lately, the design was taller and more magnificent.</p><br/><p>There were luxurious leather seats and a large inner space inside, which would surely win over Chinese high-end customers.</p><br/><p>To satisfy their desire to show off, the logo on the headstock was much larger than that on other models. One could see it even from 10 meters away.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the first Chinese man to drive the car. He stood on the cliff, waving at Cong Nianwei and Qu below him, who looked as small as dots.</p><br/><p>The place where they stood was his destination. His job was simple. What he had to do was drive the car around the turns and take a handsome pose on the deserted beach.</p><br/><p>He fastened his seat belt in great spirits.</p><br/><p>The cameraman installed a small camera right before him and sat in the passenger seat, carrying another manual camera.</p><br/><p>Crew members on and under the cliff were waving flags at each other. Everything was ready. An employee knocked on the window and waved a flag down, indicating that the shooting could begin.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned on the music and smiled at the cameraman before starting the car.</p><br/><p>\"A good car and good music make for an enjoyable trip...\"</p><br/><p>The cameraman recorded his smile carefully with his camera. Qin Guan\u2019s performance had begun early.</p><br/><p>It was the famous Fate Symphony. The camera was rolling, recording everything.</p><br/><p>First, his hand. There was only a hand with slender fingers visible on the frame. Then an iron wrist watch the same color as the car, expressing the taste of the owner.</p><br/><p>Another camera in the backseat was capturing the elegant back view. The tidy grey shirt of the driver showed his unique charm.</p><br/><p>The camera moved to capture his eyes. Most of the driver's face was in the dark. Only his sparkling eyes and long eyelashes were visible. The shape of his eyes was beautiful. His pupils were black, the light reflected on the window looking like stars in deep ponds.</p><br/><p>The camera shifted again. The beautiful hand covered the controller as the driver stamped on the accelerator. The beautiful car and the handsome man finally broke away from all constraints. They looked like they had wings!</p><br/><p>The cameraman and director was holding on to the handle. His tongue was tied both from admiration for the handsome guy and fear.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. Unlike his small Ford, driving a luxury car was amazing. That explained why men always wanted luxury cars.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was driving fast. He felt unparalleledly well. This reminded him of the crew on the other side of the ocean, the steep mountain paths, and the road he had driven through.</p><br/><p>There was also a scared man sitting on the passenger seat there, and the driver had the same delighted smile on his face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

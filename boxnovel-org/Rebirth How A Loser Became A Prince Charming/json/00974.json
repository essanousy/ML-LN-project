He had a gut feeling when it came to anything related to national interests.</p><br/><p>As expected, he saw a strange smile on Sister Xue's face. Wang didn't even dare to look up at him.</p><br/><p>\"Tell me all the details! What's up with your expressions?\"</p><br/><p>Wang hastened to give him a file. Qin Guan glanced inside and saw some normal proposals.</p><br/><p>The problem apparently was not in the job itself.</p><br/><p>\"And here is the job of the Fuwa representative.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that the job the Olympic Organizing Committee proposed?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, obviously. You will be in charge of the mascot sales. Franchise stores will be set up in second-level cities, and your photos will appear along with the Fuwa, the Water Cube and the Bird's Nest. The Olympic Organizing Committee trusts you.\"</p><br/><p>What a great job! Why am I not getting paid? This is unfair!</p><br/><p>As a patriotic young man, Qin Guan had decided to sacrifice himself for his nation.</p><br/><p>Actually, the promotional film had been scheduled after 2003, when China had won the Olympics bid competition.</p><br/><p>The foreign promotional film would have to meet the requirements of the Olympic Organizing Committee and promote the image of the ancient, vigorous Chinese cities and China's flourishing development all over the world. The viewfinder era, the number of participating extras and the careful selection of the landscape was a first-time experience for Chinese documentaries. The short, almost 18-minute promotional film would be a synopsis of a history of a thousand years. Every director who was involved in the project considered this less than enough. Culture, humanity, and geography aside, how could such a beautiful country be shown adequately in such a short film?</p><br/><p>Thus, when the directors found out that the committee had hired another Chinese star for the short documentary, they were unhappy with its decision.</p><br/><p>Are you kidding? No Chinese star is that popular internationally. Nobody would recognize them around the world. Not unless this person is Qin Guan. At least one person out of 50 would recognize him.</p><br/><p>As a result, the director was excited when he saw Qin Guan enter the studio.</p><br/><p>\"Ha! It's you! The committee always causes me trouble. You are the only exception!\"</p><br/><p>\"You are so polite, sir. I was caught off guard too, you know. I'm sorry to trouble you.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no. At first, we only selected ordinary people for the film. It was hard for us to hire a star because of our limited alternative choices. You are different, though. You are popular around the world. You are the first actor from the Chinese mainland to own a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. You are perfect for this film.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to work hard, both for the film and for the director!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The show required six Asian models, six African models and some white models. The boys felt really lucky to be on the stage.</p><br/><p>The three Asian men expressed their gratitude and respect for Qin Guan. Their feelings had nothing to do with his age. They were only based on his achievements.</p><br/><p>Daisuke Ueda took a deep bow before Qin Guan and stretched out his hands sincerely. When Qin Guan shook his hands kindly, the Japanese model looked up at him in admiration. He felt extremely flattered. Japanese people admired power and only obeyed people with authority.</p><br/><p>Singaporeans, on the other hand, were more cunning. They only cared about profit, and power and money governed over the fashion circle. Age and appeal meant nothing to them. They only liked to cooperate and compete against each other.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the Korean model walked closer to Qin Guan. This was rare, as Koreans were usually unable to read a situation correctly. This model had been born and raised in America though. He had received standard American education, so his English was much better than his Korean.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the American media, he knew all about Qin Guan's status in the fashion and entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>The industry was no heaven. Stories about the complexity of human nature circulated among the handsome models. </p><br/><p>Qin Guan had changed a lot through time. He was no longer the crazy model that had participated in the Chinese Fashion Week. Back then, he had accepted any offers he could get and left nothing for other models.</p><br/><p>Now he had reached the top of the pyramid and was able to choose the best jobs, so there was enough work left for the struggling male models.</p><br/><p>Everyone was grateful for his kindness.</p><br/><p>The shining star left with his team amid the grateful gazes of his peers.</p><br/><p>Far away from that noisy site, Qin Guan and his team found a good restaurant where they could have a party.</p><br/><p>People had big dinners in France. The country had long enjoyed a good reputation for its delicious food, but finding delicious food at a reasonable price was really hard. French restaurants always charged too much.</p><br/><p>If one travelled to Paris from far away, it would be a letdown for them to end up having dinner in Chinatown in District 13. Qin Guan's keen nose detected a small restaurant in a narrow street in District 10. A wonderful smell filled the entire street.</p><br/><p>It was already 10:30 pm, so the restaurant welcomed their last wave of customers before closing time. The room was crowded with eight people.</p><br/><p>A French girl with red cheeks and freckles walked over to them with a pencil.</p><br/><p>\"What would you like?\"</p><br/><p>Her English was poor. Despite the foreigners pouring into the city during the Paris Fashion Week, French citizens did not stoop so low as to learn English.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled warmly at her. \"Where is the menu?\" he asked in standard French.</p><br/><p>The happy girl pointed at the paintings on the wall. \"Right there!\"</p><br/><p>It was so simple!</p><br/><p>\"Beef, parsley and onion stew, served with a secret sauce.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chicken with tarragon and lemon meatballs, fried in various sauces.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mutton with cilantro, cumin and soy sauce, fried in alcoholic beverages.\"</p><br/><p> \"Pork with fennel, red pepper meatballs and soup, the best choice for bread dipping.\"</p><br/><p>\"The vegetarian meatballs are a perfect mixture of chickpeas and eggplant, so they are refreshing, but not greasy.\"</p><br/><p>There were various ingredients and cooking methods used. Everyone understood the menu thanks to Qin Guan, who translated it from French.</p><br/><p>All the dishes cost a fixed 20 euros. For an extra five euros, one could get a soft drink and a portion of vegetables.</p><br/><p>Everyone began feasting on the delicious meatballs. Even the restaurant's small bowls looked like artwork.</p><br/><p>Each portion included five meatballs. When one cut them with their knife and fork, they could see steam rising from them. The tasty juice, spices and meat were a perfect match. This food was definitely worth the trip to France.</p><br/><p>After dinner, they had some vegetables, fruit and cheese to clean their mouths. The soda bubbles in their glasses were twinkling like the stars in the sky of the strange city.</p><br/><p>Hello, Paris, the place of any Chinese fashion designer and model's dreams.</p><br/><p>Farewell, Paris. Qin Guan had changed the rules once again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

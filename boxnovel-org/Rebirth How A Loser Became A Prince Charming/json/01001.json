He just held his phone in his hand as he struggled to make his way through the crowd backstage. He was so full of energy, that he felt as if he was on a cloud. Wang Liying followed him eagerly.</p><br/><p>\"Where are you going, Brother Qin? Calm down!\"</p><br/><p>The opening ceremony was still going on, yet Qin Guan had reached the door like a smart monkey. If he rushed out to the square, he would make the next day's headlines. Suddenly, Wang found her savior by the door. Abandoning any pretense of politeness, she shouted loudly, \"Lang Lang! Catch Qin Guan!\" Her roar silenced the crowd. Lang Lang, who was a smart guy, caught Qin Guan in time.</p><br/><p>\"I got him! Now what?\"</p><br/><p>Wang made her way through the crowd, \"Brother Qin, the president is meeting us after the opening ceremony. Did you forget? Plus, you have another job!\"</p><br/><p>At the end of the ceremony, all the athletes and actors would gather on the square like one big harmonious family. This was an olympic custom. Qin Guan was a solo actor, so his presence there was important. If he didn't stay, there would be gossip published in the media the next day.</p><br/><p>However, Qin Guan's joy encouraged him to negotiate with Lang Lang.</p><br/><p>\"I'm your boss, I'm the one who pays you. Release me, or I won't pay you this month!\" Birds of a feather flocked together. Lang didn't take Qin Guan's threat seriously.</p><br/><p>\"Who cares? You can keep my salary as a gift for my nephew.\"</p><br/><p>Aren't you generous? Why don't you share your commercial profits with your nephew then?</p><br/><p>Before they could start fighting again, they noticed something strange. The backstage had gone as quiet as a deserted valley. All the actors had fixed their eyes on the three of them.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Are you going to be a father? Congratulations!\" Everyone suddenly clustered around him and started asking questions.</p><br/><p>The control director ran backstage. \"Everyone come back for the encore! Get ready! Get into position! Remember to smile when you pass by foreign athletes!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to go out again. He looked like an immortal in his loose robe as he walked through the square array of foreign athletes slowly. There was not a single person standing close to him. Everyone was afraid of looking ugly in comparison to him.</p><br/><p>Thus, Qin Guan was easily spotted by the foreigners.</p><br/><p>\"Oh my!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone rushed over to him shamelessly. \"Can we take a photo together? We are fans of yous!\"</p><br/><p>The sports stars were running after Qin Guan like ordinary fans.</p><br/><p>\"What's happening over there?\"</p><br/><p>The chaos drew the attention of President Hu. \"Wow! That young man is really popular. I know him. It's Qin Guan, right?\" Qin Guan was so successful that even the Secretary General had remembered him!</p><br/><p>\"What a joyous night! Let's put an end to this successful opening ceremony.\" The splendid fireworks marked the end of that exciting night.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

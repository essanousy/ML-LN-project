He is returning to China. Do you know who will pick him up from the airport? Liu Xiaoyang and I! We are his best friends!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Li Jie was doomed to die for a woman. He would do anything if a woman asked in a flirtish manner.</p><br/><p>As a result, the news spread all over campus overnight.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia, who was a senior student now, was busy preparing for the postgraduate entrance exams and her thesis, as well as cherishing the passing happiness of student life.</p><br/><p>She was a powerful sister at the college, so her girlfriends told her about the news. Words couldn't express her mixed feelings.</p><br/><p>She sat in the empty grand hall for a long while before she fnally dialled a familiar number. Mou Xiaoliu's voice came from the other end of the line.</p><br/><p>They had not contacted each other ever since Mou had graduated. As time went by, their precious memories faded away.</p><br/><p>\"Hello! It's me, Huang Jiajia.\"</p><br/><p>\"Jiajia? What happened? Why are you calling me?\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean? Am I not allowed to call you?\"</p><br/><p>She was as bad-tempered as usual.</p><br/><p>\"No, I was just surprised. I'm very excited. I've\u2026 missed you.\"</p><br/><p>After a long silence, came an unnatural response. \"I missed you too...\"</p><br/><p>\"I just wanted to tell you that Qin Guan is coming back.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Why? Was he expelled?\"</p><br/><p>Her voice had gotten higher. Huang had to move the receiver away from her ear.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you so upset? According to Li Jie, he is coming back for work.\"</p><br/><p>\"You scared me!\"</p><br/><p>\"If you are free, we could go see him at the airport.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, Jiajia. It was great to hear from you!\"</p><br/><p> \"Oh, rubbish! I'll send you a text later.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. I'll pick you up from campus!\"</p><br/><p>\"See you later!\"</p><br/><p>Huang hung up with a smile.</p><br/><p>When Li Jie woke up, he found a team waiting under his dormitory.</p><br/><p>\"Li Jie, Li Jie! Get up! Where is Liu Xiaoyang?\" the energetic girls shouted at him.</p><br/><p>It was terrible for a man to be awakened early in the morning. Li Jie opened his window angrily.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? I'm sleeping!\" When he saw the crowd below, he paused.</p><br/><p>What happened? Did the American Army invade China? </p><br/><p>He shook his head in an effort to wake up. Then he saw dozens of fellow students, both familiar and unfamiliar, looking at him as if he was a god.</p><br/><p>\"What happened?\" he asked again, lowering his voice.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go to the airport to get Qin Guan!\" the girls shouted together, led by Huang Jiajia.</p><br/><p>Their flag was blowing in the wind. \"Qin Guan, we love you!\"</p><br/><p>Li Jie was really annoyed. He was hangover, but he had to maintain his dignity before the girls.</p><br/><p> Bang! He slapped his own face. \"F*ck! What shall I do now?\"</p><br/><p>Before he could figure out a plan, Huang Jiajia shouted at him in a decisive voice, \"Don't try to fool me! Don't blame this on Liu Xiaoyang. We are not some crazy fans. You won't lose face before your roommate!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is probably used to getting flowers and being applauded by fans. As his old friend, you can't meet him empty-handed. Look! We are the perfect team! You will be our leader!\"</p><br/><p>The girls were cheered up by Huang Jiajia. She is right. We are not some shameless fangirls. We support our idol considerately!</p><br/><p>Li Jie scratched his messy hair. Then he craned his neck outside the window.</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Let's go together!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei saw them waiting behind the railing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

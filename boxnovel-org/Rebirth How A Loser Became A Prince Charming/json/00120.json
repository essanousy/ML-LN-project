He was 196 centimeters tall, and he played basketball. His favorite hobby was chasing girls by showing off his sports skill.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he couldn\u2019t stand that there was someone in the court wearing more fashionable clothes than him.</p><br/><p>Although Liu was younger, shorter and uglier than him, he couldn't look down on him when it came to luxurious equipment.</p><br/><p>I have to teach him a lesson! I\u2019ll beat him to the ground!</p><br/><p>Wang Hao was surrounded by sport-loving girls. Actually, football and basketball female fans were quite different.</p><br/><p>Girls stood by the basketball court shouting \"You\u2019re so handsome!\", but football players were welcomed by disdainful eye expressions and their girlfriends yelling \"Your feet are stinky! Take a bath or you\u2019re not coming home!\" (How could they take a bath without going home though? It was unfair treatment.)</p><br/><p>With the ball under his arms and his hands in his pockets, Wang Hao walked up to Liu Xiaoyang, swaying from side to side. \"Child, basketball shouldn\u2019t be played like that,\" he told Liu in a friendly tone. His voice had barely faded away when his fans started laughing softly.</p><br/><p>Wang Hao took two steps back and began to imitate Liu's actions. He even stuck his tongue out like the famous Michael Jordan.</p><br/><p>His act produced noise and excitement from the onlookers.</p><br/><p>With a jerk, Wang Hao leaped high and made a nice shot towards the basket. The ball touched the edge of the basket gently before falling through the net.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was watching his movements keenly, the muscles of his body adjusting slightly. He was taking advantage of this chance to learn.</p><br/><p>After the shot, Wang Hao showed off with a series of running, jumping and shooting moves, which were natural and smooth from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>Even the boys off-site applauded unconsciously. The onlookers had gathered around. Wang Hao made an energetic slam dunk proudly, attracting applause again.</p><br/><p>Then he rolled the ball on his finger tip, suddenly throwing it back to Liu Xiaoyang.</p><br/><p>At the time, Liu was lost in thought. The ball was about to hit his forehead, when a hand stretched out from the left and caught it.</p><br/><p>Liu came to his senses. As cold sweat ran all over his body, he looked at Qin Guan gratefully and thanked him in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pulled Liu outside the court and whispered to him, \"Change pants. I believe in you! You\u2019re the best player of the Accounting Department! Cheers!\"</p><br/><p>Moved by his words, Liu nodded and ran quickly back to their dormitory to change his shorts.</p><br/><p>The members of the Student Union hung up a banner across the court in memory of Chamberlain and the competition began. Students jammed around the court, encouraging their own players and watching the commotion.</p><br/><p>In the first match, the Accounting Department played against the Economic Management Department.</p><br/><p>The five short, thin players of Qin Guan's department were poor compared to their strong, tall opponents. Qin Guan looked at Wang Lei in surprise. \"Will you play?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m a reserve,\" Wang Lei answered calmly.</p><br/><p>His part-time job had made Qin Guan a myth in the Accounting Department. The monitor of his class dared not ask him to play for fear of getting rejected.</p><br/><p>The judge blew his whistle, and the players of the two teams leaped for the ball. It was wonderful! The center player of the Economic Management Department pushed the ball toward his team.</p><br/><p>The tall boys ran towards the basket. Before their opponents could reach them, they scored. The score was 0:2.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang got the ball and encouraged everyone calmly, \"Don't worry, we\u2019ll get it back!\"</p><br/><p>Then he started moving. Without the long pants, the smart boy showed his true ability. He slipped under the arms of the opponents\u2019 defense and took a shot.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Wang Lei shouted, \"Bravo!\" That was when the girls in the court noticed Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Is that Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Where is he? Where is he? Oh, I saw him!\"</p><br/><p>\"I think that\u2019s him. He is not in sportswear though.\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s a pity. Maybe he\u2019s not good at basketball. Nobody's perfect!\"</p><br/><p>They were still talking when Liu Xiaoyang scored again. Although his opponents were superior, the score difference remained the same. With his smart movements, Liu Xiaoyang managed to control the situation.</p><br/><p>Wang Hao asked for a time-out, and the players gathered around to talk. \"That guy is really annoying! They won't beat us, but he will be a pain.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it will influence the following games.\"</p><br/><p>\"In the next game, our opponent will be the Financial Department. It\u2019s hard to say who will win.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall we play dirty to finish the game as soon as possible?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I\u2019m in!\"</p><br/><p>The sports rogues reached a decision fast.</p><br/><p>The game began again. At first, Liu Xiaoyang was on the defense, but the point guard took the ball and passed it to him. The big player behind Liu took this chance to push him with his body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

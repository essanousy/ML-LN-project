At the Palace Museum? Is it even open at night? Your boss wants to attack the palace, right? Cheers!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's staff fell silent. Nobody showed any sympathy for them...</p><br/><p>Anyway, they were still getting paid vacation time, which was really important.</p><br/><p>They were all trembling as they gathered outside the entrance of the Palace Museum. It was not gloomy and lonely, as they had expected. It was actually as crowded as a bazaar.</p><br/><p>\"Are you a staff member? Queue up over there!\"</p><br/><p>Maybe we came to the wrong site?</p><br/><p>When they entered the palace, they realized that it was different. It was not as calm as usual. Instead, people were shuttling all over the yard. There were lights, props, dressing rooms...</p><br/><p>Are they shooting a period show?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard through the loudspeaker.</p><br/><p>\"Attention! Create a path in the middle for the couple to walk through and get into position!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's friends had helped him find a crew that would shoot in the palace. He had hired them for one night, so that they would take his wedding photos. Cong Nianwei's dream of having a traditional wedding would come true. This was not a folk wedding, but a luxurious feudal feast.</p><br/><p>The audience was expecting the couple to appear in costumes of the Qing Dynasty, when Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei suddenly showed up hand in hand. They were wearing costumes that combined the styles of the Tang, Song and Ming Dynasties, which had been China's golden time.</p><br/><p>The red brocade looked gorgeous and joyful under the lights. Golden and silver silk threads were rolling like waves and clouds as they walked. A ribbon with two red flower balls connected them together.</p><br/><p>One was on one end of the red ribbon, and the other was on the other end. They were holding hands as they thought about growing old together...</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the yard as people were wishing the couple the best silently. The yard became an ocean of flashlights as cameras and cell phones worked endlessly.</p><br/><p>An engineer coming out of the museum after work, who was shocked by the scene on the square, got off his bike and asked a security guard, \"Is that crew shooting a film? What kind of film is it? Is it another one about the Qing Dynasty?\"</p><br/><p>The guard smiled. \"Nope. This is the first time I see a couple take its wedding photos here.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>The engineer stopped. He decided to watch the grand event. Soon, his eyes were fixed on the costumes.</p><br/><p>He was in charge of repairing ancient clothes at the museum, so as an expert, he found Qin Guan's formal outfit unique.</p><br/><p>It was the combination of the Tang, Song and Ming Dynasties, as well as its modern aesthetics that made it unique. The historical combination impressed the old master, who had no idea about fashion.</p><br/><p>The outfit had been created by the best designer team in the Chinese fashion circle, so it certainly deserved praise.</p><br/><p>\"It's brilliant!\"</p><br/><p>The man, who couldn't move his eyes away from it, took out his camera and joined the group of photographers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

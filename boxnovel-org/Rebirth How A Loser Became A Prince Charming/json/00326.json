Even though he had not known him for a long time, he considered Qin Guan a reliable guy.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan kept talking, using professional terms.</p><br/><p> John unconsciously rushed up to Wendy and spread his arms. In Susanna's eyes, he was about to embrace her enemy.</p><br/><p> Susanna's hometown was renowned for its bikers and skinheads. She was an irritable girl in nature.</p><br/><p> She suddenly pulled at John's T-shirt and hugged him tightly. Before John could explain, Susanna pasted her lips on his.</p><br/><p> Everyone saw the couple kissing each other in the middle of the crowd. Wendy was about to land right in front of them.</p><br/><p> In Qin Guan's opinion, if no precautions were taken, Wendy would break her slender legs, which was a terrible thing to happen to any dancer.</p><br/><p> \"That\u2019s dangerous!\" Even Cong Nianwei could see that this was not going to end well. Feeling sympathetic, she gently pushed Qin Guan in Wendy\u2019s direction. \"Any ideas?\"</p><br/><p> Weizi, I\u2019m not invincible. I can do nothing to help her, short of being a landing pad.</p><br/><p> Time was pressing. Qin Guan decided to save the girl first, so he rushed over to Wendy.</p><br/><p> Wendy couldn't control her body well though, and Qin Guan had no time to get prepared. He was knocked down by her.</p><br/><p> Wendy fell down and landed on Qin Guan's body with her legs open wide. Her right foot was on Qin Guan's jaw, and her left was between Qin Guan\u2019s legs. Right on his crotch, to be exact.</p><br/><p> Stunned, Cong Nianwei covered her mouth. She was relieved when she saw the thick grass under Qin Guan's head. She rushed up to the two of them fast.</p><br/><p> \"Get up! You are sitting on my boyfriend!\" Cong Nianwei ordered Wendy, who was still on Qin Guan's stomach with her legs open.</p><br/><p> You\u2019re making my boyfriend suffer.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei got even angrier at the thought. \"Hey! Watch your underwear!\"</p><br/><p> Wendy came back to her senses and looked down unconsciously.</p><br/><p> Her skirt had been flipped. Fortunately, she had been wearing safety pants. She stood up reluctantly and fixed her clothes.</p><br/><p> Her eyes were still focused on Qin Guan\u2019s face though. She was feeling extremely frightened and helpless, and she thought the Asian boy had a mysterious charm.</p><br/><p> Under his glasses, she could see a pair of beautiful eyes. No pores were visible on his smooth skin. Why does he suddenly look so different?</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was lying on the ground tamely while Cong Nianwei was checking him carefully from head to toe. He looks like an ordinary boy. There\u2019s nothing special about him.</p><br/><p> \"Are you okay?\" Cong Nianwei asked nervously as she pulled Qin Guan up from the ground and wiped the dust from his clothes.</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s nothing. My back hurts a little though. You can apply safflower oil on it at night. My mother gave me a bottle.\"</p><br/><p> \"No problem. I\u2019ll take care of your jaw too. You have a bruise there.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled warmly at Cong Nianwei, who was wiping the dust off with her handkerchief.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Wendy realized something. This mysterious Asian boy is a miracle. He is as splendid as the brightest light on Times Square, yet he can also be as dim as any ordinary person.</p><br/><p> When John pulled away from Susanna\u2019s kiss, he saw that both Wendy and Qin Guan were safe. He was very relieved. If Susanna had caused an accident, there would have been chaos.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

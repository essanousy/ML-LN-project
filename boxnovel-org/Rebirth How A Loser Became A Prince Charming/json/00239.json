They all began to loosen their scarves and take out their handkerchiefs.</p><br/><p>Before the manager could approach to help Qin Guan, they had all lined up.</p><br/><p>What should I do now? Forget it, I\u2019ll just get in line.</p><br/><p>As the only man present, the manager walked to the end of the queue. Luckily, I have a white handkerchief in my pocket.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan signed fast, and the customers did not idle around. After a close contact with their idol, they expressed their gratitude politely and left.</p><br/><p>The girl kept chattering, making the process more fun.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, still two girls left! Your signature is good, though the Chinese characters are not easy to read. That's okay. All star signatures are illegible. Should I give you my card? Your industry is quite different from mine, but you can call me if you need to. As they say, the more friends you make, the more roads you take...\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue grimaced, but accepted her elegant card.</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan had signed the last autograph for the manager. The manager gave Qin Guan several catering coupons along with the handkerchief. Qin Guan cheered up as soon as he saw the gift. What a kind man!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hugged him to express his appreciation. The man left feeling numb.</p><br/><p>The girl watched him go jealously, murmuring, \"That\u2019s so cunning! It\u2019s gender discrimination!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled and reminded his fan, \"We are leaving. Thank you for your card. I\u2019ll contact you if I need to.\"</p><br/><p>Then he winked at her and left with Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>The girl nearly got a heart attack. What should I do? He\u2019s so handsome!</p><br/><p>As he exited the plaza, Qin Guan began to worry about his future. I\u2019ll have a hard life if I\u2019m a recognizable idol.</p><br/><p>In the car, Sister Xue threw the card at Qin Guan. \"She is the general agent of a foreign brand in China. It\u2019s a pity that it has nothing to do with your profession.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan picked up the card and recognized the familiar trademark on it.</p><br/><p>It said, \"US STANLEY China General Agent, He Qian.\"</p><br/><p>The heroic young girl had been Qin Guan's peer in his past life! Qin Guan put the card into his card holder longingly. It might be useful someday.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei left the meeting hall with her huge bag after the press conference ended.</p><br/><p>She drove back to her office as fast as she could. In the car, her palms were sweating nonstop. It was the first time a strict woman like her had stolen something.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t understand why she had taken Qin Guan's jacket. Her brain had not been working at the time.</p><br/><p>Before the astonished eyes of her staff, she pushed into her private office with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>She closed the door and shut down the window-shades before she collapsed on the couch.</p><br/><p>After a full minute, Qu Xuemei let out a long breath. She slowly opened her bag and took out the jacket in the simple plastic bag.</p><br/><p>She frowned. She had never held anybody else\u2019s belongings in her hands, let alone a man's jacket.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she became angry. She threw the jacket into the trash bin next to her, then returned to her desk and sat down. I have to work. There\u2019s so much paperwork to read through.</p><br/><p>Her attention was still on the trash bin though. She bit her lips and kicked the trash bin open again.</p><br/><p>She picked up the plastic bag up with her fingertips and called her secretary.</p><br/><p>The assistant secretary knocked nervously. \"Take the jacket to the dry-cleaner\u2019s. Bring it back when it\u2019s ironed and pressed,\" Qu told her.</p><br/><p>The secretary relaxed when she heard the task. She took the bag and left quickly.</p><br/><p>Qu turned on her computer and clicked on the email she had failed to send hesitantly. Qin Guan\u2019s material was in the attachments.</p><br/><p>Qu added the Citizen file and pressed send after hesitating for a long time.</p><br/><p>She cared for Qin Guan too much. He would have to rely on himself in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about this. The time for his qualification exams for going abroad was approaching.</p><br/><p>He couldn't focus his attention on insignificant things. The following job would be the biggest testament of his identity as a model.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

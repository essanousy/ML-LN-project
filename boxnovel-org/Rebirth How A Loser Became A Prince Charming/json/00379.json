Why are you hitting me? I cleaned the syrup for you! You are so unreasonable!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan bounced up and down and ran around the room. Cong Nianwei was chasing after him with a teddy bear.</p><br/><p>\"You bastard! Clean the syrup from the floor!\"</p><br/><p>It was a professional conflict between a doctor and a nurse.</p><br/><p>The sunshine in the room was replaced by moonlight. The tenants left and closed the door, leaving the empty apartment behind them.</p><br/><p>It was noisy out on the streets. That night, Manhattan finally revealed its true nature, like a monster showing its sharp teeth at night.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his blue skin, the iron nails on his head and the torch in his hand, Joseph looked like the Frankenstein monster.</p><br/><p>The twins had dressed up as vampires, wearing funny wings on their shoulders.</p><br/><p>The Mexican zombies had left the building earlier. The owner of the building, who was an old American woman, had hung up a large basket by the entrance.</p><br/><p>Trick or treat. The kids were not allowed into the building, but the candy in the basket was a considerate gift for them.</p><br/><p>Happy kids were getting out of their parents\u2019 cars. Holding small pumpkin lights, they took some candy from the basket.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Here!\" A long black Rolls-Royce was parked on the street. Xu was inside the car, dressed very formally.</p><br/><p>After a serious analysis of his advantages and shortcomings, he had dressed up as a wolf. His short, thick figure looked stronger that way.</p><br/><p> His tail coat looked pretty good on him. He looked like a refined, educated guy.</p><br/><p>Between the handmade leather couch, the fridge, the wine cabinet, as well as the Halloween props, there had been little money left over for him.</p><br/><p>The boy had invested a lot for the Barnard College girls. His father had sincerely appreciated his determination and lent him his car without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The lamps around Columbia University seemed ghostly on that special night.</p><br/><p>The parking lot was full. People from all directions had gathered in different halls. Xu wasn\u2019t worried about parking though. He lowered down the glass of the window and waved a bill outside.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks!\" A green hand valet took the bill and a car yielded its place to Xu.</p><br/><p>There was no Lei Feng spirit [1] in the US. Everyone wanted to get paid for their effort. A rich man could buy a whole building in New York. A parking space was nothing in comparison.</p><br/><p>Everyone got out of the car. Under normal circumstances they would have attracted a lot of attention. On that day though, no one paid attention to them. Everyone was really excited about the parties.</p><br/><p>Before heading into the hall, Xu didn't forget to smooth his hair and make himself look more presentable.</p><br/><p>Their names were written on the invitations. Xu had given some blank invitations to somebody else as a gift.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll recommended you for chairman of the Chinese Student Union of Columbia next year...\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you kidding? I have no time...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was surprised. He didn\u2019t look brutal or fierce at all, if one ignored the fake brains on his costume.</p><br/><p>Xu pointed to a Chinese student in disdain. The student was giving a hot girl a flattering smile.</p><br/><p>\"That idiot is our chairman. He always asks voters for support. He is too greedy. I know you are busy, but I could take over. I didn't waste the other two invitations. Look over there...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked in that direction and saw two familiar figures. They were both active among Chinese students.</p><br/><p>Unlike hard-working Qin Guan, there were some Chinese students that preferred to engage in social activities and college politics. The chairman of the Chinese Student Union of Columbia led a small group of hundreds of people.</p><br/><p>Insiders knew something about those groups. They were independent financially, unlike the public supervision of other Columbia unions. There was so much to do with those accounts.</p><br/><p>Of course, Chinese merchants acted as sponsors, which was quite different from how things worked in China.</p><br/><p>The chairman was able to control the budget, and public relations were also a lure for candidates.</p><br/><p>\"They are both pretty capable. One was in charge of public relations and the other of internal finances. Both of them were satisfied with that idiot.\"</p><br/><p>\"They wanted a chairman that didn\u2019t interfere. You are both good-looking and capable...\"</p><br/><p>\"For many years, there hasn\u2019t been an outstanding Chinese guy among us. We have one now. You just wait and see...\"</p><br/><p>They were talking about a power-seizing plan, when suddenly a red-haired beauty caught sight of Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his doctor's uniform, he was shining like a pearl in the dark night.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] Lei Feng was an ordinary soldier renowned for his accommodating nature back in the 1960s.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

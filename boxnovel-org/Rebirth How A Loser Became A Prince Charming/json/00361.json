Qin Guan decided to impress everyone with his outstanding image.</p><br/><p>The perfect couple mounted the stage with grace and pride.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei lowered her head slightly to wear the royal crown, which was inlaid with bright crystals. They would make the front page of the university newspaper the next day.</p><br/><p>The romantic night finally came to an end. The prince and princess left in a luxury car, followed by a queue of even more expensive cars.</p><br/><p>They parked at their building. Before they could say goodbye to their friends, Lan Jin's blonde head peeked out.</p><br/><p>\"Remember, you are a member of our club. I know your address now. Check your mail later. Don't forget my number. I\u2019ll call you later. He Ming is the unreliable one, but he is always busy. You are royal to me. Wait for my yacht!\"</p><br/><p>So I\u2019ll basically be your babysitter?</p><br/><p> Qin Guan shook his head helplessly and told Xu Xiaoxiao, who was also in the car, \"Don't run wild with us. We\u2019ll take care of those naughty guys. Tomorrow we\u2019ll know our midterm grades. You shouldn\u2019t be late.\"</p><br/><p>Bro, it was Lan Jin who would have to pay attention if they ever got together.</p><br/><p>The roar of the car broke the silence of the night. They turned around the corner and disappeared. As they were going up the stairs, Qin Guan suddenly realized something.</p><br/><p>\"Cong Nianwei?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"What is your crown made of? Is it valuable?\"</p><br/><p>It was just like Qin Guan to want to put a price on a symbol of honor.</p><br/><p>\"It's only made of crystals, not diamonds. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s expensive. According to my estimations, the frame must be made of PT. I\u2019ll check it out in the laboratory later.\"</p><br/><p>They really were the perfect couple.</p><br/><p>They were both down-to-earth people. The halo of fame and wealth would never influence their firm will.</p><br/><p>It was another ordinary morning. Students shuttled back and forth on campus with nervous expressions. The bell rang and all the students rushed to their classrooms, paying no attention to the beautiful autumn day.</p><br/><p>The pen in Kuhn\u2019s hand kept knocking against his book. His eyes were fixed in the direction of Qin Guan and Xu Xiaoxiao.</p><br/><p>Kuhn did not have a favorable impression of Qin Guan, who had stolen his best friend. He was a boastful guy who relied on his appearance, and everyone would see it that day.</p><br/><p>Xu would regret being so short-sighted. He had abandoned golden jewellery over an iron block with a gorgeous disguise.</p><br/><p>At Columbia, looks only prevailed for so long. That yellow monkey should have stayed in its corner tamely, just like he had during his first class at Columbia. It would have been the best decision for everybody involved.</p><br/><p>As he thought of that, Kuhn felt a little proud. He saw the college staff pasting the grade list outside the classroom. Prof. Martin was also handing out their marked papers.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nudged Xu to wake him up. He was dozing off on the desk. He had drunk too much the previous night. Qin Guan pushed his paper towards him.</p><br/><p>\"B, B, B+... Wonderful! I\u2019m satisfied!\"</p><br/><p> His reaction was not strange. Professors at American universities used the weighted score system, which was comparatively reasonable. It focused on the general performance of a student instead of the marks of a single exam.</p><br/><p>For example, if a student got 85 at the midterms, 90 at the end of term, 100 for homework and 80 for their paper, and they hadn\u2019t missed a single class the whole semester, those marks would be multiplied by the corresponding percentages to form their final score.</p><br/><p>The final grade would be 90\u00d740%+85\u00d725%+80\u00d715%+100\u00d710%+100\u00d710%=89.25. In a way, this was fair.</p><br/><p>A-, A and A+ equalled 90 to 100, so Xu\u2019s B and B+ were a pretty good result, especially considering the heavy pressure put on students at Columbia.</p><br/><p>Xu felt proud and relieved. He was in the mood to comment on other people\u2019s marks now, so he craned his head to get a look at Qin Guan\u2019s mark. His jaw dropped onto the desk.</p><br/><p>What he saw was a series of A+.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! I never saw you at the library. You always disappeared as soon as class was over. How did you get that result?\"</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin was also curious about him. Qin Guan always finished his homework perfectly in a short time. He was the only one to get a full mark in the whole Finance Department. He was his pride.</p><br/><p>Before he could openly praise Qin Guan though, another good student of his, Kuhn, suddenly appeared before Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He showed his marks to Qin Guan and Xu Xiaoxiao disdainfully. \"Do you guys see? What does \"sincerely convinced\" mean? I don't want to waste my time talking to you.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

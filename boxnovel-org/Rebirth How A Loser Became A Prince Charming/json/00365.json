The first show is really lively!\" John handed the plastic bag to Qin Guan as he looked around.</p><br/><p> There was no spare space, so he sat down on the floor. \"Introduce yourselves to each other. We are all LEE models. From left to right, this is M, L, W...\"</p><br/><p> What a simple introduction! The models protested immediately.</p><br/><p> \"F*ck, you always act like this in front of beautiful girls, John!\" L, who had a sexy full beard, glanced at Qin Guan with his grey eyes. Then he covered his face. \"Ah! A beautiful boy. He\u2019s so handsome!\"</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m L.\"</p><br/><p> A man of 1.90 meters with hairy legs was standing before Qin Guan on a single foot. His other foot was in the air. What a wonderful scene!</p><br/><p> \"Back off!\" W pushed L away and leaned his big face into Qin Guan, \"Darling, you know John is a shameless bisexual.\"</p><br/><p> \"He spent last night with three girls. You should choose a loyal gay man like me! Look at my muscles! They\u2019d give anyone a sense of security.\"</p><br/><p> \"In a dangerous city filled with monsters, only a strong man like me can be your safe harbour.\"</p><br/><p> The man went down on one knee and rolled his sleeves up to show his muscles.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan whispered to John hopelessly, \"Is he homosexual or bisexual?\"</p><br/><p> John answered with an awkward smile, \"Homosexual...\"</p><br/><p> Smiling at the strong men, Qin Guan turned around to pick up a wooden block from under the leg of a table.</p><br/><p> They were all straightforward and incompatible with high-end custom-made apparel. Armani and CK models were educated, refined and royal.</p><br/><p> On the first day of the Fashion Week, all the brands had sent their best models. Compared to Armani models though, models of other brands were inferior.</p><br/><p> The models of the opening show hadn't shown up yet. Their level was also unparalleled.</p><br/><p> LEE was the leading brand in jeans though, so their models were not inferior to anyone in the backstage area, although they had a different style.</p><br/><p> One of the Asian models became a focus point backstage. Even the staff couldn't shout at the crowd after catching sight of Qin Guan's smile.</p><br/><p> He was like an ancient scholar from a traditional Chinese painting. His voice was like pearls falling into a jade plate.</p><br/><p> \"Look at this!\"</p><br/><p> The well-dressed boy crashed the wooden block into pieces.</p><br/><p> Wow!</p><br/><p> Everyone turned away from him, some in admiration, while others in envy or spite. It was like someone had pressed the \"continue\" button, making them get to work.</p><br/><p> John's friends were staring at the pieces.</p><br/><p> \"Okay, John. He\u2019s got the clothes. The show will start now. We can talk later.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes, that's it!\"</p><br/><p> They left fast. Qin Guan grinned proudly. The rotten block had been used to support the table. It was wonderful to scare people away.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, he noticed a commotion at the entrance of the backstage area. The calm, peaceful models seemed surprised, thirsty and eager to impress.</p><br/><p> This was because Giorgio Armani, one of the top designers in the world and a native Italian, had appeared. He was their lucky star.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stared curiously at the old man with the silver hair in the middle of the crowd. He was wearing a leisure suit.</p><br/><p> His navy cashmere cardigan, simple T-shirt and Khaki pants were elegant, graceful Armani designs.</p><br/><p> He had taken his new favorite model, Chad, to the fashion week, with the intention of causing a storm amid the gloomy economic situation.</p><br/><p> Surprisingly, Chad was the model Citizen had compared to Qin Guan. Destiny was a magical thing.</p><br/><p> Unlike the other models, who tried their best to impress Armani, Qin Guan just sat there calmly.</p><br/><p> If one wasn\u2019t given an opportunity, they could always just grab it. Since they would be representing different brands on the same stage, they could compete against each other in a dignified, imposing way.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan only had pleasant thoughts. He wasn\u2019t annoyed by the chaos at all.</p><br/><p> The chief designer and senior manager of the CK operational department saw the peaceful boy in the corner and exchanged an appreciative glance.</p><br/><p> \"An Asian model for the opening show?\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p> \"A brave choice, but a good one.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was an excited expression in his eyes. Okay, but you asked for this. If the photoshoot goes bad, it's not my responsibility.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei finished her introduction and shouted at Richard, \"Hey, the show is about to begin. All idlers get out! Want to have a try? You are old, but still vigorous\u2026 Please get out quickly then!\"</p><br/><p>Hey! I\u2019m not old! I\u2019m only turning 32 this year. You are the older one here, okay?</p><br/><p>Richard was angry, but he could do nothing but retreat before Qu. Only the staff members and the two models were left in the greenhouse.</p><br/><p>Chad had also been warned to do his best. After Richard left, he cast a sympathetic look at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>That Asian model must have offended the chief editor of VOGUE. Now I have to take him out! If I use my full ability, I will destroy his future. He may even start doubting the purpose of his own life.</p><br/><p>As he thought of that, Chad smiled at Qin Guan mercifully and followed the assistant to his fitting room.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused by his smile. Did my father die or something? Why did he look at me that way?</p><br/><p>The fragrance of flowers was floating in the air. The people in the greenhouse calmed down enough to enjoy the peace of the elegant environment.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, outside the greenhouse, there was a riot of colors. At the joint invitation of the top five fashion magazines, brand businessmen had gotten together on the roof.</p><br/><p>The roof had become their temporary office. Sitting on post-modern style chairs, they enjoyed their cocktails and talked about their plans for the latest collection. They were clear about the purpose of the party. It was another promotional event of the fashion circle. It was a win-win situation. Magazines needed their investment, while they focused on media publicity. A model of high commercial value would benefit both sides.</p><br/><p>The sun set slowly as the atmosphere of the party became active. After the initial greetings, everyone seated themselves, waiting for the surprise arranged by the top magazines.</p><br/><p>The organizers had really put a lot of thought into the party. Even the chairs looked interesting.</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\"</p><br/><p>Several people screamed as the chairs in the back rose higher and the front ones descended a little. LED lights of different colors lit up under the chairs. Different areas were divided by different colors.</p><br/><p>Brands that sold advanced ready-to-wear apparel were a mysterious silver color, and jewellery brands were represented by blue. Make-up and cosmetics were red, while leather products were yellow. Green stood for watches and other accessories.</p><br/><p>The audience members smiled at each other like naughty kids finding new toys. They felt relaxed in that beautiful environment. This was a good chance to let loose and express their whimsical thoughts.</p><br/><p>The two models had no idea what was going on outside. One of them was confident, and the other was excited. They stood shoulder to shoulder on the path between the flowers.</p><br/><p>Chad cast another merciful glance at Qin Guan and stretched his hand out to him like a king presenting his hand to a peasant for a kiss.</p><br/><p>\"Chad.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his hand with a shy smile.</p><br/><p>If Sister Xue or Qu had seen his smile, they would have known that Qin Guan was about to play some kind of trick again.</p><br/><p>The assistant gave them the final instructions. \"You two walk on the site together and separate at the end. Chad goes first and Qin Guan follows. Understand? We\u2019ll start now.\"</p><br/><p>They both nodded. Suddenly, music started playing.</p><br/><p>The lights on the ground were turned on. They looked like fireflies in the dark as the strong lights on the ceiling were extinguished one by one. The greenhouse looked mysterious, yet elegant.</p><br/><p>Every cell in Qin Guan's body was shouting, \"Go! Go! Go! Blossom on the stage!\" That\u2019s what Qin Guan did. His refined leather shoes started stomping on the fireflies without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Chad realized that things were getting out of control as he walked along with Qin Guan. The show was not in his hands anymore. The Asian model next to him was not an underdog he could easily crush.</p><br/><p>Despite his poker face, Chad was shouting silently in his mind. This is not an absolute massacre! It\u2019s a fair game!</p><br/><p>Wearing a beige trench coat and a pair of pants of the same color, Qin Guan expressed his feelings freely. Armani\u2019s style was self-liberation after all. Every piece of clothing on his body was shouting at the audience, \"Not like this. This is comfortable!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan followed his heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

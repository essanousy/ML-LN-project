They had to do so with true news though, instead of fabricated ones. If this had happened on the Chinese mainland, Sun would have been punished for disturbing public order and been forced out of the industry.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks, He Ming. I'll treat you to dinner back at home. Don't stay in New York. Come back to China when you have spare time.\"</p><br/><p>\"I will.\"</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan called Jay Chou and told him the truth, Jay fell silent for a while.</p><br/><p>He knew immediately who had leaked the news. Chen Zeshan, EMI's director, was a brave, smart guy. He had started his career as a composer and climbed up to his current position by using his own strength.</p><br/><p>He was a great example of a talented man who had risen from the bottom of the hierarchy.</p><br/><p>While he had been working at EMI, he had discovered Jolin Tsai, Stefanie Sun, A-Mei and Show Luo. In two years, EMI had taken the lead in the music circle, beating Rolling Stone, Global and The Millennium in the process.</p><br/><p>The man was brave enough to divert the public's attention and steal the spotlight in shameless ways. Sun's new album would become very popular after that incident.</p><br/><p>That brave man was the rulemaker of the Taiwanese music scene. Jay was his equal, though. That was why his interview had been promoted by the media. If he had been a nobody, people would never have heard about it.</p><br/><p>A group of singers with the same interests followed his advice, as his brave proposals had made them popular and earned them bigger profits.</p><br/><p>What could Jay Chou do?</p><br/><p>\"Leave this to me. In a few days, the Chinese media will release an announcement from the embassy to comfort tourists. As you know, the tourism industry contributes greatly to government taxation. This exploration of a new route has cost businessmen a lot. They won't sit and watch as their businesses are ruined by fabricated news. The Chinese agencies and the Egyptian government will do something about this.\"</p><br/><p>Chou hung up in relief. As expected, the news started getting published the next day. All web portals and TV stations were talking about the fake news concerning Sun. Taiwan also heard the shocking news.</p><br/><p>The paparazzi went crazy!</p><br/><p>Are you an idiot? This is not ancient times, when liars got away with everything. This is the Information Age, so such actions are reckless and unwise. </p><br/><p>Sun had come across an unprecedented risk. Singers without integrity were abandoned by their fans. Her album would be useless now.</p><br/><p>Chen had not expected this. To his surprise, there were people in the world that were treating these news as seriously as the end of the world.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sneezed again. A lot of people had been missing him lately.</p><br/><p>Despite Chou's expectations, as soon as the news were leaked, EMI fired Chen due to his poor performance. It was not Jay Chou who had destroyed his career, but Sun, the singer he had tried his best to promote.</p><br/><p>Sun seemed reluctant and aggrieved when she faced the cameras. People could tell that she had been forced to do so.</p><br/><p>She even stuttered a little.</p><br/><p>\"This was a promotion strategy of the company...\"</p><br/><p>\"Manager Chen told me...\"</p><br/><p>\"He just wanted to divert the attention of the media.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, you must have misunderstood. I'm not resentful...\"</p><br/><p>She could have won an acting award.</p><br/><p>EMI was under great pressure from all directions, including the Chinese mainland and Egypt. Everyone knew that they would have to sacrifice some things to save the company. Thus, Chen's dismissal was not a surprise. It was actually a crucial decision that had to be taken fast.</p><br/><p>Chen, who had been betrayed both by Sun and EMI, faced the consequences and left the music circle in defeat.</p><br/><p>Soon, he would be forgotten by everyone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

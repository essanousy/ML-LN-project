He had to be fierce, but he recalled Wang's instructions, and controlled the muscles of his face to hide his feelings.</p><br/><p> Wang Jingcao was a powerful woman. She would never give him useless advice.</p><br/><p> On the large screen, even the slightest change on his face would be visible, which was different from the vigorous feeling of TV. The actors felt that limitation themselves.</p><br/><p> If it wasn\u2019t for Qin Guan\u2019s intelligence, the director would have considered his acting skills over the top.</p><br/><p> On camera, Qin Guan seemed angry and ashamed for getting defeated by Changkong, but ready to risk his life again. For a green hand on the large screen and an actor playing a small part, his performance was wonderful.</p><br/><p> Besides, his beard covered his flaws to some extent, making him perfect on camera. Both Zhangs nodded. The boy has great potential considering his acting skills and face.</p><br/><p> Stomping on the ground, Qin Guan leapt high and hacked at Changkong. Zhen's spear was rotating like a windmill, trying to resist his attack.</p><br/><p> One wrong move made Qin Guan lose. His sword was kicked away by the spear and he fell down to the ground. Before he could stand up, the spear was pointed at his chest.</p><br/><p> The pain of failure, the unwillingness to struggle and his depression all showed on his face. He was growing up on the large screen. He had mastered the skill of hiding.</p><br/><p> Having lost the duel, he retreated silently. His brothers walked up to Changkong looking frustrated. The seven swordsmen bowed before their enemy. Standing in a line, they yielded the exit of the hut to Changkong.</p><br/><p> When Changkong pushed the door open, a man shouted from behind him, \"Wait!\"</p><br/><p> Until then, the shooting had gone quite smooth, if one ruled out that near accident. The seven swordsmen turned their heads around to find the source of the voice.</p><br/><p> That\u2019s when the problem began. They failed to turn around together at the same time. After several tries, the assistant director used the stupidest way, assigning a crew member to hold a sign.</p><br/><p> Facing the camera, the crew member waved a small flag to the seven swordsmen. It was as if the audience was watching a tennis game.</p><br/><p> Li Lianjie showed up in black, which meant their part was officially over.</p><br/><p> They left the set, leaving space for the props of the next scene. The action director patted them on the back in encouragement. They had done their part well.</p><br/><p> Zhang Lushan praised Qin Guan, \"You were born a martial artist. You will have a bright future in this industry!\"</p><br/><p> Sister Xue made a face. Your industry is dangerous and toilsome. Only a few stars are famous all over China. My boy will stay away from that business. He\u2019s leaving the studio, so he\u2019d better say goodbye to Director Zhang to promote himself.</p><br/><p> Director Zhang, who had a good opinion of Qin Guan, was also glad to praise him. It was a pity that he was a reserved man. He only told Qin Guan, \"Good boy!\"</p><br/><p> That was enough for Sister Xue though. She would make good use of it.</p><br/><p> Before leaving, Wang Jingcao tentatively came over to talk to Qin Guan and Sister Xue, showing great interest in the Asian Fashion Man competition. She had also organized a media interview abroad.</p><br/><p> When they left, Wang returned to Chen Daoming. Seldom did Chen Daoming see his agent so interested in a green hand. \"Why are you so interested in him?\" he asked her. \"He is an independent actor.\"</p><br/><p> Wang was confident. Actually, he is depending on me. He is my secret weapon.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan returned home late that night. Lying in bed, he thought about his schedule the following days. Although he only had a small part in the film, the shooting was painstaking.</p><br/><p> Sister Xue had contacted the competition organizing committee. Unless something unexpected happened, he would be flying to Tokyo in a few days to attend the award ceremony.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

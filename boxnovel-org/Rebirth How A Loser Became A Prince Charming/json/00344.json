He waited outside until the girl got dressed.</p><br/><p> \"Don't stay around. Go!\" Qin Guan shouted rudely at the model, keeping up his performance.</p><br/><p> \"Oh, thank you. I\u2019m leaving...\"</p><br/><p> Trembling, the girl looked up and got a hold of his collar. She tried to keep her savior in her memory.</p><br/><p> The pores on Qin Guan's face were invisible in the dim light. There was a beautiful shadow above his lips. Of course, one had to ignore the torn uniform with the blue stripes, which was stinky in the summer.</p><br/><p> Lisa smiled in relief. She bowed before Qin Guan to express her gratitude.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan just wanted to leave as soon as possible. Everyone would have helped a little girl unwilling to do such a thing.</p><br/><p> \"Go home as soon as possible. Take care of yourself.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan waved at Lisa and left the corridor with his backpack.</p><br/><p> He had to return his outfit to the assistant waiting for him. He thought she would blame him for being late, but she didn't say anything. Instead, she gave him a piece of paper with her phone number.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was in a relationship though, so he threw the paper into a trash can after leaving the building.</p><br/><p> Giant colorful advertisement boards were hanging on the tall, cold buildings. Cars shuttled back and forth on the streets. Behind the bustling scene, sin was always lurking.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan relaxed only when he got home and found Cong Nianwei in the kitchen.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m back.\"</p><br/><p> \"Welcome home.\"</p><br/><p> It was sunny the next morning. The fragrance of pine trees on campus covered the ugliness and darkness of the previous night.</p><br/><p> Several weeks after classes had begun, the students already had to take quizzes. Qin Guan was surprised by the random timing.</p><br/><p> The instructors didn't take inferior things like cheating into consideration. The answers to practical questions couldn't be found in a textbook.</p><br/><p> As his classmates were writing swiftly, Qin Guan handed his paper in. At Columbia, students could hand in their papers at any time, which saved them time for the next subject they had to study for.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan gestured at Xu Xiaoxiao to call him later and rushed out of campus.</p><br/><p> As expected, he got a notice from CK about the final interview. He had to have final sample measurements taken at the CK headquarters.</p><br/><p> If he didn't do anything wrong, after a small conference regarding the autumn collection, he would get a contract for the New York Fashion Week.</p><br/><p> That was his final goal. He sent the notice to Sister Xue.</p><br/><p> Considering her keen instinct for trends in the fashion circle, Sister Xue must have known about his intention to choose between those three brands.</p><br/><p> She didn't disappoint him. As soon as she got Qin Guan's email, she began to make future plans, even though it was late at night.</p><br/><p> First, she would release the news to his fan club, and then she would intervene with the promotion plan New Silk Road had decided on.</p><br/><p> Wearing his school uniform, Qin Guan went into the building without a pause.</p><br/><p> He looked professional, indicating his identity to the security and reception staff.</p><br/><p> He is definitely a new model of some designer.</p><br/><p> Sitting in a small meeting room, Qin Guan began to exchange information with other models, from whom he learned about the importance of the final test.</p><br/><p> The final test was not just for the chief designer and the designing department. It was also an important event for the photographers, the PR department and the operational department. They all gathered together that day.</p><br/><p> The small launching conference was not just about the next collection. It was also CK's final test of the market before the New York Fashion Week.</p><br/><p> There would be three top brands from France and Italy at the fashion week, which made CK, a traditional brand from the US, feel threatened.</p><br/><p> Unlike CK, which was very flexible, they were brands that tailored to traditional styles. Upper-class men always preferred extreme elegance though. CK had to stress on the trend.</p><br/><p> That was the reason they were using their full strength.</p><br/><p> As the models of the apparel group entered the bustling backstage area, the underwear models got off the stage and changed clothes behind the curtains. They turned around calmly and began to swiftly put on their outfits.</p><br/><p> A designer with all his tailoring tools hanging from his body asked the models to get on the stage one after the other.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was pulling his sweater down when he saw Lisa staring at him with red cheeks.</p><br/><p> The girl had recognized her savior right away when she had gone backstage. However, the noisy crowd discouraged her from walking up to him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

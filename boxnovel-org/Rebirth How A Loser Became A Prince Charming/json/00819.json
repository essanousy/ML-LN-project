The elegant French men and gentle British men went crazy over the Chinese dishes.</p><br/><p>All the embassy employees were shocked. The crew was behaving like convicts that had just been released from prison.</p><br/><p>Wang Liying didn't forget her responsibilities as she was eating. News about the riots in Paris were spreading online all over the world. The news were quite striking. Because of the time difference, it was 5:00 a.m. in China, but 4:00 p.m. in America.</p><br/><p>As a result, the Americans were the first to hear the news. Wang turned on her laptop and saw anxious fans talking about the riots. The latest news about Qin Guan on his blog had actually been about his trip to France, so everyone was worried about their idol. Is he in danger?</p><br/><p>Some European fans were following the news in real time. The crisis had spread from France to Germany and Belgium. Wang Liying waved at Qin Guan hurriedly. \"Say cheese!\" Qin Guan automatically grinned at her with his spoon in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Click!</p><br/><p>Wang uploaded the photo on the blog and added a few words.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your concern. We are at the Chinese embassy in France, enjoying some friendly dinner. Everything is going well!\"</p><br/><p>The news acted like a shark in a pond, suddenly stirring up the water.</p><br/><p>\"Ha! He is safe! I can sleep through the night now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yay! Safety first!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why is he at the embassy? Is it dangerous outside?\"</p><br/><p>\"Take a careful look at the photo. There are so many people and equipment around. They must have been filming.\"</p><br/><p>\"They must be trapped inside now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Anyway, it's definitely dangerous. Otherwise, they wouldn't have gone to the embassy.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Chinese embassy seems safe. They are enjoying some dinner!\"</p><br/><p>\"What are they eating?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's rice in a clay pot.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone relaxed as they looked at the warm photo and forgot about the issue at hand.</p><br/><p>Things improved at night, so some embassy guards escorted them back to their hotel. God was finally favoring them again, so they managed to reach the hotel safely.</p><br/><p>The burned cars were still on the road, but the hotel had strengthened its security force. Everyone fell asleep after such an exhausting day.</p><br/><p>It was a night without dreams.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Qin Guan stood by the window, looking at the messy street below. There were barricades, destroyed weapons and traces of fire everywhere. The battle had been really fierce the previous night, but thanks to the Chinese embassy, they had managed to dodge a bullet.</p><br/><p>The prestige of the Chinese embassy was known both at home and abroad.</p><br/><p>The crew bid each other farewell at the airport. After a long journey, Qin Guan got off the plane and stood on the lawn of the Capital Airport. He felt steady and safe immediately.</p><br/><p>He was really happy when he read the feedback online.</p><br/><p>\"The Chinese embassy is so powerful! They can protect you in case of an emergency!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. You could also apply for political asylum!\"</p><br/><p>\"China responds quickly to natural disasters.\"</p><br/><p>\"Foreign countries are inferior to China's upper-level mechanisms.\"</p><br/><p>\"During an earthquake or a flood, the government will send aid everywhere. There is no difference between a remote area and an urban area.\"</p><br/><p>\"You have a point!\"</p><br/><p>Some people used their own countries as an example. In Japan, where natural disasters happened frequently, most people tried to help each other.</p><br/><p>In Africa, people had to think of subsistence first.</p><br/><p>Even in North America and Europe, it was hard to organize an effective, unified rescue mission after a natural disaster.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

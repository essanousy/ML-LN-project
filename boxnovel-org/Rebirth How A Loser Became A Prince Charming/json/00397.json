As the girl pulled, Qin Guan's bottom was exposed.</p><br/><p> The girl burst into laughter. The accident drove her last bit of desire away.</p><br/><p> \"You are so cute. Forget it, bye!\" The girl covered her body with the sheet and put on her clothes underneath.</p><br/><p> She only had a small role, so her work was finished. She left without hesitation, seeking new prey.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan let out a long breath. Before he could put on his clothes, the prop master passed by with some equipment and told him, \"Hey, Qin Guan. You don't need to put them on. You\u2019ll have to take them off again later.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled awkwardly, but didn\u2019t reply. The guy in charge of the costumes approached him. \"You are saving me money...\"</p><br/><p> Are you kidding? I like wearing clothes! </p><br/><p> Beauty knew no gender.</p><br/><p> In the next scene, the hero wanted to get drunk after that failed attempt at sex.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was naked again, but no important parts of his body were revealed. In the US, there was a strict movie rating system. George\u2019s skill was exactly to the point.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan\u2019s straight back and slender legs looked wonderful on the camera. Actually, people liked to be naked at home.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan left the bedroom leisurely and tried to find a bottle of beer in the fridge.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, the door opened. The roommate of the silver-haired girl, Drew Barrymore, walked into the apartment.</p><br/><p> There was no sheet or quilt covering Qin Guan\u2019s body. He was only wearing a pair of cheap slippers.</p><br/><p> He immediately opened the door of the fridge to cover his most private parts.</p><br/><p> The fridge was an 1980s model. George and the prop team had tried their best to find a big one. The light came on when the door opened, shedding light on Qin Guan's bottom.</p><br/><p> Drew scanned him from head to toe with a seductive expression.</p><br/><p> \"You\u2019re her new boyfriend? I\u2019ve never seen you before. Not local, are you? Where are you from?\"</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m a Jew...\"</p><br/><p> \"I just had a date with an Asian. I have dated people from many different races. Jews are very mysterious. Shall we have a try?\"</p><br/><p> Then she put down her bag. \"I\u2019m thirsty. I want something cold.\"</p><br/><p> Sister, what are you about to do? I\u2019ll get you something to drink. Keep some distance from me, please! Leave me alone!</p><br/><p> She had become obsessed with him on first sight. Stretching out her fair hand into the fridge, she reached between Qin Guan's bottom and the fridge door.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stood still awkwardly, waiting until she got two bottles of beer from the fridge.</p><br/><p> Everyone around felt jealous as they watched the scene. Suppressing his embarrassment, Qin Guan expressed his admiration of the beautiful woman.</p><br/><p> They looked at each other tenderly, love shining through their eyes.</p><br/><p> Barrymore handed Qin Guan a bottle and toasted with him. Their bottles clanked as they drank from each other's bottle.</p><br/><p> George let out a long breath. This was a wonderful meeting of two outstanding actors. People called that a meeting of diamonds.</p><br/><p> \"Okay!\" He decided to call it a day. Qin Guan and Drew looked at each other.</p><br/><p> Sister, could you please leave first? I\u2019m still in the fridge. Although we have air-conditioning here, it's still winter. My fifth limb is nearly frozen.</p><br/><p> Barrymore gave Qin Guan a big, meaningful smile that he didn't understand.</p><br/><p> When she walked away, Qin Guan rushed to the bedroom as fast as he could. He had to recover under the quilt.</p><br/><p> The open fridge looked like a big mouth laughing at the poor man.</p><br/><p> When all the props were cleared away, Qin Guan realized that Director George was already enjoying himself in the resting area. He left without saying goodbye to him.</p><br/><p> He had to catch a bus, as his car had been taken by that terrible woman.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was at a stalemate with Qu Xuemei\u2019s deadly foe at the VOGUE headquarters. Qu had threatened him over Qin Guan's inner pages.</p><br/><p> Richard was known for being capable to spot a real pearl among fake ones. Qin Guan's photos were on three magazines at the same time, but the positions were different. He was on a cover, some inner pages and one group photo. The results were quite interesting.</p><br/><p> One week later, the ranking list of the US fashion magazines was completely different. VOGUE had originally been in the lead, W following tight on its heels. Thanks to its unconventional cover though, Raynana's magazine, NYLON, had jumped up to the third place on the list, ahead of W. Only VOGUE and C were above it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

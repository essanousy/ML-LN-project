They had put a large mat before the couch and arranged the iced beer and dishes as they were waiting.</p><br/><p>Wang Lei threw a green soy bean in his mouth. \"Why are you so nervous? You even want to drink in advance!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nonsense! All fans will get ready before the match.\"</p><br/><p>\"An hour in advance?\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re ruining the atmosphere! It's not even funny!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at his noisy friends, Qin Guan took a sip of his beer. Suddenly, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's me. I\u2019m free now, I\u2019m just watching the match. What? To your club? I have six friends here. Okay, great!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hung up and told them, \"It\u2019s boring to watch TV at home. We can go somewhere else. My treat, okay?\"</p><br/><p>Annoyed, Ye Dong said, \"Don't use your job as an excuse. It\u2019s really hot outside. We have everything here. What idiot would accompany you to some unknown place?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right!\" those cunning monkeys answered in one voice.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up and started to change clothes. Disappointed, he said, \"Fine. I wanted to treat you to the most professional foot massage in the city, but it seems that I have to go alone. Don't blame me.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Why didn\u2019t you say so? Was there something wrong with my ears just now? Did anyone else hear that he would take us to a foot massage shop to watch the soccer match?\" They all looked at Qin Guan, putting their beer cans down.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fastened the buttons on his shirt calmly and turned his head around. \"Your ears are working fine. My customer is the owner of a club. He has a massage centre.\"</p><br/><p>The large board on the roof entered his mind automatically. He shook his head to drive it away. \"Will you go with me? I\u2019m leaving.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes! I\u2019ll go with you. We are best friends after all!\" Liu Xiaoyang jumped up and handed Qin Guan the key apologetically.</p><br/><p>\"We share each other\u2019s fortunes. We have to support you!\" They finished their beers noisily and clustered around Qin Guan to leave.</p><br/><p>When the car arrived at the original location of the pedicure shop, Qin Guan saw that it was already in ruins. The guys, who were competing over who would get there first, suddenly fell silent.</p><br/><p>Clearing his throat, Qin Guan awkwardly called Bu Qinglu on the phone. \"Brother Bu, it's me! Where is the pedicure shop? Where did you invite me to? Oh, no. It's been a long time since I was last here. Okay, I\u2019m going.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan started the car again. His roommates sighed in relief and resumed fighting. We did not come in vain after all.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan drove around the Fruit &amp; Candy Club and saw that the two-storey buildings were decorated. There were three splendid gates next to each other.</p><br/><p>There was also a pedicure center, a beauty salon, and a chess &amp; card room. They looked immeasurably different than the previous ones though.</p><br/><p>They got out of the car and climbed up the fire exit ladder, following Bu's instructions. They saw a large room protruding out.</p><br/><p>They knocked and found Bu inside. He was smoking and frowning.</p><br/><p>Before he could even greet Bu, Qin Guan was pulled in.</p><br/><p>Bu Qinlu craned his head carefully to have a look at Qin Guan\u2019s friends. Then he ordered a strong bald man, who was in the room, \"Da Niu, take them to the pedicure room.\"</p><br/><p>Da Niu was surprised. \"Brother Bu, today we are...\" he tried to remind Bu.</p><br/><p>\"This is not business. Shall we not serve our own brothers?\"</p><br/><p>The bald man bowed before answering, \"No problem. I\u2019ll take them. Brother Bu, I\u2019m also free now. Could I have a massage, too?\"</p><br/><p>Bu waved him away impatiently, and the man led Qin Guan\u2019s roommates downstairs.</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang was sitting on the couch, sighing in despair. Bu Qinglu was standing behind him with a serious expression. \"What's the matter?\" Qin Guan asked.</p><br/><p>Bu pouted, but Wang took out the three account books.</p><br/><p>\"Son of a b*tch! People envy our business and sent a fake customer to look for mistakes. Our staff were wary of strangers, but she seemed like a normal customer. She had treatments and bought some underwear. The girls didn't give her an invoice. It\u2019s a latent rule of the industry.\"</p><br/><p>\"We were reported to the Tax Bureau.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yesterday, they came to inspect us and ordered us to stop business for internal rectification. They even took away our account books. F*ck! I\u2019d break his legs if I knew who that son of a b*tch was!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knocked on the table in front of the couch unconsciously. Data started rolling around in his mind automatically.</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes to recall the statistics, and then opened them again. \"Don't be nervous. It's only a temporary suspension. According to my estimation, they didn't find much. Maybe just the one thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"I remember everything in this field. There are no loopholes. To this day, there is no charge for tax evasion. The Tax Bureau is smarter than anyone. Best case scenario, you make up the invoice and taxes. Worst case scenario, you get punished.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Hailing looked at the wall. \"How much?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not much. There\u2019s the overdue fine and the tax penalty, which is five times the original tax. That\u2019s nothing for you. With proper handling, there\u2019ll be no administrative penalty. Anyway, you two are law-abiding businessmen. You have all the certificates, right?\"</p><br/><p>The two guys sighed in relief and thanked Qin Guan. \"You are the right man for this job. You might just be helping us, but we believe in you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head modestly. \"It's nothing. An honest accountant wouldn't cheat you. You still have a steel safe in your domain, right?\"</p><br/><p>Wang was surprised. \"How did you know? The room has been redecorated.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pouted and looked towards the wall, reminding him. \"I know where it is, and I know all your improper actions. You didn\u2019t listen to me. You put all the cash inside. You were afraid of trouble.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

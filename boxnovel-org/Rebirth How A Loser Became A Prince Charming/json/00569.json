The bastards she had mentioned were Qin Guan and his class, who she thought were vulgar, yet confident about their taste.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m the boyfriend of this vulgar woman,\" Qin Guan answered.</p><br/><p>Alice grimaced at his confidence, but got her expression under control fast.</p><br/><p>\"Perfect!\"</p><br/><p>He and Natalie finished their first scene smoothly. The crew couldn't help but applaud them.</p><br/><p>Julia and Jude exchanged a meaningful glance and shot an urgent look at the director.</p><br/><p>They were crying out silently. Quick! It's our turn! Our scene will be even better!</p><br/><p>A war over honor began.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Natalie smiled at each other.</p><br/><p>\"Your black hair and eyes are so beautiful. If it wasn\u2019t for your deep eyes, high nose and fair skin, you would look like an Asian beauty.\"</p><br/><p>Natalie felt flattered, but she was not shy. She accepted the compliment of the handsome man politely. \"I\u2019m half American, half Israeli. I was born in the mysterious city of Jerusalem.\"</p><br/><p>That explained her fine, elegant features. Jerusalem was a cradle of beauties.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was lost in thought, when suddenly Natalie patted his chest.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m so happy to be complimented by a handsome man like you. Ha ha...\"</p><br/><p>She was not a very smart girl. She seemed more like a crazy child.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\"I like you Chinese. You always tell the truth...\"</p><br/><p>That hurts! This girl must be gifted at combat.</p><br/><p>Before they could focus on the other actors, Julia and Jude had already finished their performance. They exchanged a guilty glance and then burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>We watched their performance carefully, didn't we?</p><br/><p> Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Why is she still patting my chest?</p><br/><p>Nichols turned his back to them and looked at his watch. We could shoot another scene. It's a pleasure to cooperate with such talented actors.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Natalie were still fighting and laughing.</p><br/><p>Those two are idling around!</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, Natalie! It seems like you are well-prepared. Let's move on to the next scene!\"</p><br/><p>What? Natalie paused. In the next scene, she and Qin Guan would have to cast amorous glances at each other. It would be hard for them to get back into character considering their current mood.</p><br/><p>She was right. Director Nichols was a film god though. Qin Guan walked over to his place tamely.</p><br/><p>\"Can you do it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\"</p><br/><p>At that resolute, decisive answer, they turned their heads towards each other.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was curious about her occupation and private life. He lifted his arms slowly without hesitation, his hand caressing her neck. His thumb was on her cheek as his other fingers pressed against the side of her head.</p><br/><p>Natalie got lost in his strong manly smell.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan moved closer and lowered his proud head. The girl in his arms was moving closer to him as well.</p><br/><p>His lips were right over hers, a small gap separating them. Natalie sucked in a breath.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan smiled and let her go, like a cat tired of playing with a mouse.</p><br/><p>Everyone let out a long sigh of relief, like divers resurfacing on the water.</p><br/><p>They couldn't tell whether they had wanted them to kiss or not. Their feelings couldn't be described acutely.</p><br/><p>\"Perfect!\"</p><br/><p>At the director's order, the passionate couple stopped.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>\"Well done, Qin Guan! You changed your expression really fast! Natalie, you should be on the same page. Pay attention to your behavior, please.\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>\"What are you talking about?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nothing!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the director walked over.</p><br/><p>\"Good! Keep up this sense of familiarity. We will be shooting a wonderful scene tomorrow!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

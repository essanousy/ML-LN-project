It was late in the night, and the moonlight poured in through the windows, silent and naughty. It was early autumn, and the insects were flying from their hiding places, seeking food for themselves. In the chilling autumn night, Qin Guan wanted to light a cigarette, but realized he had quit smoking many years ago. Fine! I can't even pretend to be doing something. I might as well go back to sleep.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia was very excited. On their way home, she talked with Mou Xiaoliu about her heroic actions that night. Nobody would have thought that the tireless young girl was a martial artist. She had lifted the drunk troublemakers and spun them around like wheels. They had been completely dumbfounded as they'd fallen down on broken tables and chairs, forming a beautiful picture. The two friends had returned to their respective homes. They had silently founded their own club.</p><br/><p>...\u2026</p><br/><p>Tuesday arrived soon. Standing in the SS Group design studio, Qin Guan was being ordered around by people with lively gestures. The room was very noisy. There were more than 20 models and ten staff members there. The whole designing team of the SS Group was terribly busy.</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu handed the featured outfit to Qin Guan, patting him on the shoulder encouragingly before giving Sister Xue the final notice, \"Qin Guan will be the main model this time. He will get on the stage last, and he'll get on the stage again with me at the end. He'll be wearing the featured outfit of this collection.\"</p><br/><p>Then he turned to Qin Guan. \"You are only a green hand, but I see a lot of potential in you. I hope you will do well in this important show.\" Shocked by his words, Qin Guan nodded solemnly and changed into the outfit in the fitting room. Fang Yanyu and his assistant were waiting for him with their equipment. It was the first time they felt the charm of the featured outfit of the fall collection.</p><br/><p>It was a formal blue-grey suit in a standard two-piece style. The cuff and collar were slightly round, providing the finishing touch of the outfit. The handsome style would be demonstrated well to the audience. The designer had no time to appreciate its beauty though. He began making adjustments to the suit right away, discussing it with his assistant.</p><br/><p>\"The legs are a little baggy, but we can make them tighter.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall we make the final adjustments here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, the waist should be more slender.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's it! Better!\"</p><br/><p>After several changes, Qin Guan put on the outfit again and went out. Everyone's eyes lit up. With a better effect, they could expect a successful show.</p><br/><p>...\u2026</p><br/><p>It was the 50th anniversary of the PRC establishment, so many people had gathered in the capital. Qin Guan was too busy to focus on the festivities though. Following Sister Xue, he entered the backstage area of the SS Group fall collection. All the preparations were finished. The hall was going to open for the audience soon.</p><br/><p>At the time, fashion show attendance was limited to fashion businessmen, agent representatives and fashion-oriented media. SS Group was not qualified to invite celebrities, but the show was significant for Sister Xue. It was Qin Guan's first T show as a main show model, so it would decide whether Qin Guan would earn a place within that small circle of models and designers.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was sitting in a chair and resting after changing clothes, a group of people entered the backstage area, clustering around two prominent individuals. One of them was a middle-aged man with a grand temperament, and the other was a tall, slim man. As the group walked directly towards Fang Yanyu. Sister Xue cried out in alarm in a low voice, \"It's Shao Xiaobing!\" She had recognized the tall man immediately.</p><br/><p>Confused, Qin Guan asked her, \"Who is Shao Xiaobing?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was exasperated by his ignorance. \"I have told you to read fashion magazines in your spare time, but you don't listen to me! How can you have no idea who Shao Xiaobing is?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is one of the most famous male models in the country. Although he's only won some silver and copper medals in domestic contests, he has turned out to be one of the best models of our time!\"</p><br/><p>\"He is representing two first-level domestic brands, and he has also participated in a T show overseas. His status surpasses even that of several renowned models.\"</p><br/><p>\"He is called \u2018Lucky Star\u2019 within our circle. It is said that he seldom fails any interview. It's strange that he's here. Is he in the audience? He is not famous enough to attract the attention of the entertainment media though.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was making guesses as Fang Yanyu was close to quarrelling with the group.</p><br/><p>\"What are you talking about? We can't change our main show model now! Why? Because I disagree!\"</p><br/><p>The group was led by the boss of the SS Group. He had arrived happily to inform the designer that he had found the perfect model for the main show. He had put together all his resources and public relations to beg Shao Xiaobing, who had just had some spare time in his schedule, to appear in the show. Thanks to the lure of high payment, Shao had accepted the job. Considering that the SS brand was below A level, and he was an A level model with many A level shows under his belt, only money could have convinced his agent.</p><br/><p>The boss was adamant. I have spent too much money and called in too many favors to get Shao on board. He has to be the model of the main show. Fang Yanyu was quite displeased. For a designer, the main show was the spiritual center of a fashion show. He had also spent too much effort on the selection to have the model he had selected replaced just like that.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Suddenly, the \"Closer\" crew spotted him.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Over here!\"</p><br/><p>All the guests turned around and saw the powerful nominee. A thick smell of gunpowder suddenly filled the site.</p><br/><p>The banquet actually looked like a Chinese wedding feast. The red velvet tablecloths were embroidered with different patterns, and on the center of the round tables were beautiful flower bouquets.</p><br/><p>If it wasn't for the famous guests, Qin Guan would have thought that it was a luxurious wedding ceremony.</p><br/><p>He found his own name tag and took a seat, whispering to the director next to him, \"The organizing committee is wrong. If they want to promote harmony in the circle, they should organize a different banquet. Do you know about the Spring Festival Gala in China? The organizers put snacks on the tables and the audience can help themselves to anything they like. We call it a tea party, but it's much better than this awkward banquet.\"</p><br/><p>The crew relaxed at his joke. They were all looking forward to attending a party in China. Suddenly, Jude Law rushed into the hall looking exhausted. He took a seat next to Qin Guan, not caring about the name tags.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Qin Guan! You bad boy! You threw me under the bus!\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you talking about? I just arrived. What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>Jude Law almost choked as he saw Qin Guan's innocent, blank expression.</p><br/><p>\"I saw you from the car just now. You were pointing at me. Don't tell me that you suffer from amnesia!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" Qin Guan spread his arms. \"I just told everyone the truth. Chinese people are always honest.\"</p><br/><p>Jude was left speechless by his shamelessness.</p><br/><p>In a few minutes, the hall was filled with people. The curtain of the small stage rose slowly and the ceremony began. The most exciting moment of the evening was approaching.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was much more harmonious than it was at European film festivals, as most of the guests knew each other well. Sometimes, if a guest wanted to show off, they would get on the stage and act as the host or give a fun impromptu performance.</p><br/><p>After a while, the host got ready to announce the winner of the Best Supporting Actor Award.</p><br/><p>By that time, Jim Carrey, who had won the Best Comedian Award, was acting as the host. The actor didn't forget his own profession while he was on the stage.</p><br/><p>He set the golden award down onto the podium and began to make jokes.</p><br/><p>\"Here is the award for the Best Supporting Actor. Based on my estimation, it weighs just as much as the Best Leading Actor Award. That makes sense. If it was lighter, it would have been unfair to those hard-working actors. I know the winner of the award, and he is a very brave man. If his award was even one gram lighter than the other award, he would follow the Best Leading Actor everywhere and give interviews with that unlucky dog until he ruined the whole thing for him.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's true. One of my friends is really afraid of him. My friend is also a comedian. If it wasn't for a particular penguin and sea lion, that guy may have been a leading actor.\"</p><br/><p>The audience burst into laughter at his funny joke and ridiculous expression. Some well-informed people could guess the winner based on his words.</p><br/><p>When the judges had voted for the winner, they had nearly made the same choice.</p><br/><p>They knew that the guy had the necessary acting skills and public approval, so no one would dare embarrass themselves like that.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

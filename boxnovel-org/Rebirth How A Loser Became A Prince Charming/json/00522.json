Suddenly, Qin Guan switched to another dance.</p><br/><p>He opened his arms and started twisting along to the rhythm. His students followed him at once. His flirting gesture also attracted the older members of the audience, who started dancing in Nick\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>By then, Qu had finally reached Qin Guan. Before her hand could touch his shirt, the Best Actor winner shouted and jumped off the stage.</p><br/><p>He went up to Cong Nianwei and hugged her around the shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"Dance with me!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei would rather die. She struggled, but it was in vain.</p><br/><p>\"Twist around, twist around...\"</p><br/><p>She felt like she was riding a tiger she couldn't dismount. She had to move with Qin Guan.

Everyone shouted together, \"Come on! Once more! You are so cool!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stomped again, clapping his hands. He looked like an old woman square dancing. \"You are my little, little apple...\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was laughing so loudly that she could barely stand up. Just as Qin Guan was about to show them a new physical exercise, Qu Xuemei grabbed him.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? Get down!\"</p><br/><p>As she pulled him away from the stage, Cong Nianwei and the others gathered around him to check on him. Nobody knew that he was acting crazy because he was drunk.</p><br/><p>Hilton was admiring Qin Guan. It seemed that Cong Nianwei's plan would fail before it was even put into practice.

Taiwanese actors always gave unconventional performances. They were good enough for indie films, but acted strange during emotional scenes about hate between families or nations. Their Taiwanese accent and performance were too dramatic.</p><br/><p>The crew blocked an ancient street in Zhangzhou. A small century-old villa of European style was revealed to the visitors.</p><br/><p>Flowerpots with kaffir lilies were placed on the balcony, and a semi-finished oil painting was set on the shelf next to the columns, around which were rare painting tools of the time. These details told the audience that this was a rich, tasteful family.</p><br/><p>As the camera zoomed into the room, it felt almost like it was going back in time. Everyone saw the interior of the occidental home. There was a wooden tea table of European style, a whole set of Isabel tableware, and an elegant cheongsam in the room.</p><br/><p>All these details reminded the poor boy that he was in a rich man's home.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who had already changed into his costume, did not look like a countryside man at all. A talented young man would be influenced by his environment after all.</p><br/><p>The entire crew, including Li Bingbing, stared at the costume on his body. How can a man look so handsome in a Chinese tunic suit?</p><br/><p>As a typical Chinese costume, it showed off all the advantages of men in modern times. It set cruel standards for one's figure though. Only someone with broad shoulders and a thin waist would look elegant in it.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Jeong-Eun Kim, the famous North Korean leader, would.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing a Chinese royal-blue tunic suit that was actually a student uniform. The golden buttons on his chest were sparkling in the sunshine, just like he did.</p><br/><p>He was sitting before the hostess for his interview, as he had applied for a part-time English teacher position. The job paid a lot, so he had to be careful during the interview.</p><br/><p>The elegant hostess, who was an old Chinese Opera actress, was the perfect rich housewife.</p><br/><p>At the director's command, Qin Guan fixed his costume and started acting.</p><br/><p>The lady served Qin Guan tea as she asked him questions about his life.</p><br/><p>\"Where are you from?\"</p><br/><p>\"Xiluo Town, just beside the Zhuoshui River.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow, the rice of that area is really famous. It's hard to enroll at medical school if you are from the countryside though. How is your family doing?\"</p><br/><p>As she delivered that line, the camera zoomed in on Qin Guan's shoes and his bare feet. It seemed like the young man was trying his best to hide them from the woman in an effort to protect his dignity.</p><br/><p>His petty action smoothed out all the wrinkles on Director Yin's face. He was really satisfied with the short shot.</p><br/><p>The young man could consider and interpret every feeling of the character, instead of just sticking to the script. It was wonderful!</p><br/><p>When the young master of the family went down the stairs, Qin Guan realized he had gotten the job. He gave the young boy, who was dressed like an adult, a warm smile.</p><br/><p>Comforted by his smile, the small boy said, \"No!\" Then he suddenly rushed back to his room.</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Cut!\"</p><br/><p>When the boy disappeared from the camera, everyone relaxed. It was Qin Guan who had helped the small boy finish his job. The boy had never acted in a film before after all.</p><br/><p>\"Perfect!\" Yin Li rubbed his hands together excitedly. He was using traditional techniques to give the film a period-film feel. Qin Guan looked natural in that spotty pattern of light and shadow. The director couldn't be more satisfied.</p><br/><p>He actually decided to cooperate with the actor again in the future.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xu Ruoxian was much more nervous. Her agency had fought to get her that role, and she currently looked like a sweet schoolgirl, which matched well the personality of the second heroine of the film. She had actually been selected by Director Yin among numerous Taiwanese girls. Qin Guan, who was a legend among Chinese immigrants in America, was just standing there.</p><br/><p>Don't be nervous! Calm down, Xu Ruoxuan! Cheer up!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

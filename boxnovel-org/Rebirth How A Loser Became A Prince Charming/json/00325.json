Loudspeakers were playing mainstream music.</p><br/><p> Time and again, dancers competed against each other, attracting applause from the onlookers.</p><br/><p> \"Would you like to take a walk around, or apply for a bank and phone card first?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei looked at each other. \"There\u2019s no hurry. We\u2019d like to watch the dancers first.\"</p><br/><p> John liked that reply, as he had just seen Susanna, his dazzling girlfriend and cheerleader of the basketball team, competing with her arch enemy Wendy, a classic beauty engaging in modern dance. They were currently in a hot competition.</p><br/><p> Most of the onlookers were senior students at Columbia University, who were anxious to see the world in disorder. They had been watching the love-hate relationship between John and the two beauties for many years.</p><br/><p> Even John had no idea who was the ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend.</p><br/><p> Cupid always shot his arrows at random. Whose heart got broken now?</p><br/><p> Susanna made several elegant somersaults. Her nearly transparent hair was shining in the air. She was a typical American girl with blonde hair, blue eyes and fair skin.</p><br/><p> In the US, young people loved movies. Such a girl would have been the female villain in a movie. Susanna was the winner in real life though.</p><br/><p> She had been born on the West Coast, in Central California. Her father was a famous farmer who owned the wildest land in California, but she did not look like a Californian girl.</p><br/><p> As the queen of the university, she had always been a cheerleader at school. The only arch enemy she had ever had was Wendy at Columbia University.</p><br/><p> That tall b*tch was always standing high above the masses. She was nothing but a middle-class citizen, yet she constantly acted like a queen.</p><br/><p> Susanna paused and looked at Wendy in a provoking manner. Suddenly, she spotted her handsome boyfriend in the crowd.</p><br/><p> \"John!\" Susanna ran over and took his arm. \"Did you come to cheer me on?\"</p><br/><p> John looked at Wendy guiltily. The brunette looked down gloomily. Her beautiful eyelashes trembled slightly.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m working as a volunteer. What about you? Come join me and my new friends if you are not busy.\"</p><br/><p> \"Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei, this is my girlfriend, Susanna.\"</p><br/><p> \"Hello!\"</p><br/><p> \"Hello!\"</p><br/><p> Susanna glanced at the two Asian students. The boy was mediocre, but the girl was pretty in a delicate way. American boys tended to like girls like her.</p><br/><p> Susanna cast a worried glance at them and noticed that their hands were locked. They are a couple. Suddenly, her voice softened. \"We are still in the middle of the competition. I have to wait until Wendy finishes her dance. Anyway, we are good friends, right?\"</p><br/><p> John looked awkwardly at Wendy, who was standing in the center proudly. He fell silent.</p><br/><p> He couldn't show favor towards one of them, or World War III would break out.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were newcomers, so they just stood by, watching the performance quietly. They noticed the strange expression on the surrounding people's faces.</p><br/><p> Let\u2019s observe first.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Wendy moved. The music became more melodious. Her dance was sad and beautiful in a heroic way.</p><br/><p> She looked up at the sky unyieldingly, struggling with her emotions.</p><br/><p> As Qin Guan watched her with relish, he told Cong Nianwei, \"Such skill. It seems like she is not just good at contemporary dance.\"</p><br/><p> John focused on Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei happily. Their comments were actually quite accurate.</p><br/><p> \"She often performs on Broadway. If the courses at our university weren\u2019t taking up so much of her time, she would have been a chief dancer in theater.\"</p><br/><p> \"That's why I got a ballet and jazz vibe from her performance. She combines those characteristics in contemporary dance.\"</p><br/><p> John looked at Qin Guan with new eyes. The Asian boy with the black-framed glasses seemed to know a lot about dance.</p><br/><p> \"Exactly. She is excellent.\" John gave Qin Guan a thumbs-up in a slightly showy manner.</p><br/><p> \"Ouch!\"</p><br/><p> John turned his head around and saw Susanna's pink nails twisting on his bottom.</p><br/><p> Some people around them put their fingers in their mouths and whistled at him.</p><br/><p> A dancer could get startled by the whistle of an audience member under the stage, let alone their own lover's.</p><br/><p> Wendy was distracted by the whistle. She jumped repeatedly, but she forgot that she was not in a safe dancing room, but on the hard campus ground.</p><br/><p> \"She shouldn't have done that! John, catch her!\" Qin Guan warned John.</p><br/><p> Wendy realized her mistake, but it was too late for her to control her body. She flew right in John\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p> In other people\u2019s eyes, she looked like she was expressing her emotions for her ex-boyfriend. She was such a cunning girl. She had taken advantage of the dancing to throw herself at him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

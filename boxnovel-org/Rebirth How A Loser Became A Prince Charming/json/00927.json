He lay on his side contentedly, as if he was lying on grass or a soft bed.</p><br/><p>He looked like a Chinese hermit cultivating his spirit amid a white mist.</p><br/><p>All the fans and reporters were shocked by the scene.</p><br/><p>\"Come on! I won't maintain this pose for long,\" Qin Guan reminded them kindly.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>Screams were heard again. In the eyes of the Chinese fans, Qin Guan was an immortal from a web novel. He was both charming and fascinating.</p><br/><p>They couldn't believe this was happening for real!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his job responsibly. The moment he got up, hails came again from the reporters.</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations!\"</p><br/><p>\"You deserve it!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you all!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved goodbye at everyone and followed the staff to the temporary reception area. He would have a short meeting there with some good friends and finish the short, yet meaningful ceremony.</p><br/><p>Familiar faces gathered around him to express their kindness for their miraculous Asian friend.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin, you are the guest of honor, so you have to open the champagne personally!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The cork shot out and the golden liquid was poured into the tower of cups. The cups were filled level after level until champagne was streaming around the bottom of the table.</p><br/><p>\"Long live the Walk of Fame! Long live Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan squeezed his way out with the bottle as the cups were seized by the guests. Everyone wanted to get some of his luck.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan realized it, there were only two cups left on the table. Every guest that walked by him patted him on the shoulder, some consciously and some unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, what's on your mind?\" Qin Guan turned around and saw Jay Chou. They hadn't met after \"Curse Of The Golden Flower\" after all.</p><br/><p>\"I have no time to talk to you right now. Why did you come to America?\"</p><br/><p>\"To promote my new album. My music is popular among young Chinese immigrants,\" Chou answered proudly. He had to admit that his acting skills were awful compared to Qin Guan's, but he had his own job. He was the most popular singer in Asia, so he was well-known all over the world.</p><br/><p>An American team had adapted his latest album with the help of a famous American musician. Naturally, Chou had been invited to the Grammys. He enjoyed an important status on the international music stage.</p><br/><p>\"Great! The Grammys have nothing to do with my work. A Chinese guy has been nominated this year though. If you meet him, try to help him.\"</p><br/><p>\"You mean Lang Lang?\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you know him?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, we work in the same circle. I can also play the piano. Don't worry, Chinese people help each other.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is anything else bringing you here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Actually, yes.\"</p><br/><p>I knew it! That shy boy must have something special in store for me.</p><br/><p>\"But it has nothing to do with you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop! I can mind my own business.\" Qin Guan waved him away with a sense of foreboding. The answer had to be Jolin Tsai.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed at the thought of their complicated romantic affair.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Qin, would you tell the truth, even if you thought other people might misunderstand?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course,\" Qin Guan answered without hesitation. \"I don't like speculations. I believe one should be honest if they want to avoid rumors and misunderstandings. Public figures have to be even more responsible than the average person.\"</p><br/><p>As he looked at the righteous man, Chou felt lucky to have such a good friend.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

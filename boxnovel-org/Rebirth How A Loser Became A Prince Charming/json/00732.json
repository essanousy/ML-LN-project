The award-winning actor seemed to be really strict with himself. The ambition underlying his short speech seemed very difficult to realize.</p><br/><p>He had found success very young, yet he hadn't relaxed. His effort certainly deserved everyone's support and encouragement.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan received a warm applause from the audience. Whether he deserved it or not was debatable.</p><br/><p>Of course, if Qin Guan's actions did not match his words, the Chinese media would cast him aside. No one could ever fool the media.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was harmonious as the reporters started asking him questions.</p><br/><p>\"Why did you return to China at this particular moment?\"</p><br/><p>\"Today, Zhang Yimou's documentary was broadcast all over the world during the Closing Ceremony of the Athens Olympics. I represented Chinese people before the entire world, so this was the perfect chance for me to return to my homeland.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin Guan, may we know your plans for the future? Are there any new offers on the table?\"</p><br/><p>\"I only accept good scripts. My agent will be glad to receive any good-quality scripts. I'll read them all carefully.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you think your status in the international fashion circle will be affected? Will all those top brands terminate their contracts with you?\"</p><br/><p>\"I haven't signed many contracts lately. Quality is more important than quantity. Some brands have moved their headquarters to China for me. I think it won't be long before we see even more top brands in China.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporters were competing for a chance to ask him a question. Twenty minutes were not enough to satisfy them. The host watched the time, and the staff of the International Black Star Security Company stopped any reporters who ignored the time limit.</p><br/><p>They were still pretty lucky though. They got to talk with Qin Guan face to face after all. His fans were really sad after the conference.</p><br/><p>Our idol has really returned to China. It seems like he will travel for an offer if the script is good enough though. Let's hope production companies act quick and give him some good scripts!</p><br/><p>Actually, all foreign film companies were confused. Qin Guan had just been promoted to a B-level actor in America and accepted an offer from Warner Bros. Then, before people could even come to terms with this, he had suddenly returned to China.</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless over the matter. This was not a time of war after all, when actors were not considered talented individuals.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not that important for the American film circle. There was only one man who thought so.</p><br/><p>Director Li An had won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film with \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\". The Taiwanese director, who had captivated the Oscar committee with his talent and appeal, had also shocked film production companies with his elegance.</p><br/><p>As a result, Li An had gotten a script that he had been longing for. It was an indie film about homosexuals called \"Brokeback Mountain\".</p><br/><p>The script had been handed around to four other famous directors, but had been turned down by all of them. Li An was under great pressure, as he loved the script and wanted to shoot the film.</p><br/><p>In 2004, homosexuality was not acknowledged or accepted by mainstream society, so both the producer and the director were under a lot of stress.</p><br/><p>Li An though, who was a sensitive man, really loved the script. He did not just see homosexuality, but also love, kinship and humanity in the story's loneliness. That was the real message of the film.</p><br/><p>After some careful consideration, he chose Jake Gyllenhaal and Qin Guan as the two leads.</p><br/><p>Director Li An threw Qin Guan's resume on his desk. His assistant tried to comfort him. \"The company has just begun preparing for production. We have at least two to three months left. I'll contact Qin Guan's firm right away.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't forget your identity, director. You are also Chinese. You could just appeal to his emotions...\"</p><br/><p>\"This is a really good film after all. It should definitely be made.\"</p><br/><p>Li An waved his assistant away torpidly.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, another lucky director, quite different from the world-famous Li An, was sitting confidently before Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Xu Jinglei was the most artistic female actor in China. She would much rather be a talented director than a trashy celebrity of the fickle entertainment circle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

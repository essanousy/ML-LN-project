I haven't seen such a terrible performance in years.\"</p><br/><p>\"A bit mediocre...\"</p><br/><p>\"What were they thinking? They lacked any cooperation during their performance.\"</p><br/><p>There were different comments on the couples of contestants. Soon, Ouyang Fen was finished. He was quite satisfied with the performance himself. His partner was a sweet girl who had been in perfect harmony with him, and their matching outfits had looked brilliant.</p><br/><p>The judges had reacted to their performance with a slight nod. I have observed all the details! I will fly high in the sky from now on. Qin Guan won\u2019t stop my success. I\u2019ll be the winner! Ha, ha, ha!</p><br/><p>Ou Qiang patted Ouyang Fen on the shoulder as he was lost in his proud thoughts. Pointing at the stage, he said, \"Your rival is next. Look!\" Then he let out a sigh. My cousin is good from head to toe, except for his non-functional brain. I, as his elder brother, have to look out for him.</p><br/><p>As soon as the host finished her announcement, an epic battle score started playing. Ouyang Fen saw Sister Xue hand a sniper rifle to Qin Guan before he got on the T stage. It looked like a T.C.I. M89-SR sniper rifle made in Israel. This was not the time to discuss the type, but where had it come from?</p><br/><p>His cousin Ou Qiang had volunteered to buy two toy guns for Sister Xue from a toy stand. The guns looked just like real ones. Yes, he had bought two, a sniper rifle and a hand gun. One for the male model and one for the female model. He hadn't forgotten anyone.</p><br/><p>When he bragged about helping Sister Xue to his cousin, Ouyang Fen almost beat him to a pulp. While Ouyang Fen was wondering about the guns, Qin Guan had already gotten on the stage with his rifle. Li Xiaoli had gotten on the stage from a different direction, holding a toy Italy Beretta 92F handgun in her hand.</p><br/><p>The judges off the stage grew excited at once. This round stressed on the outfits themselves, not the figures of the models. This couple had spent a lot of thought on their outfits and made extensive research in a short time. Ten points for a good first impression. When they walked closer to them, the judges were even more satisfied with their modified military clothing. Such creativity! Full marks for exhibition!</p><br/><p>Following the music theme, the models didn\u2019t walk in a standard catwalk, but adjusted their steps to half-squat or stand inclined. They combined military movements, including holding the guns, shooting and advancing, with quick short steps on the stage. The judges enjoyed the short, one-minute show to the fullest.</p><br/><p>\"It's the most shinning couple I have seen in this competition. Not one of the best, but the best.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. They had a good idea about the outfits. They didn't change the original costumes, but they added details to increase their beauty. No rules were violated. Very clever models!\" That was the designer's comment.</p><br/><p>\"Their body language and their chemistry were really good.\"</p><br/><p>\"They are the most serious contestants up to this point. They even found gun props themselves.\"</p><br/><p>The four judges had a short discussion and then graded them. Li Xiaoli and Qin Guan walked to the edge of the stage, looked at each other with a smile and pointed their guns at one another as if they were going to shoot. \"Bang!\" After the sound effect, they retreated together backstage.</p><br/><p>\"Interesting!\" The designer was considering copying the scene in his next fashion show.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen was stunned when Qin Guan returned backstage. You didn't follow the rules. You added that move without authorization! You broke the rules, got it? The problem is that the effect was excellent! Ouyang Fen was lying back in a chair with his fingers in his hair. You didn't leave anyone a chance, Qin Guan. Wait and see... Wait and see! Ou Qiang was about to comfort his brother when he saw his state. \"Oh, my dearest brother. Oh my! You have a runny nose!\"</p><br/><p>When all the models had finished their performance, they changed into casual clothes and waited for their fate-determining scores patiently. Their current scores had been calculated, and they were as follows:</p><br/><p>Figure-20%</p><br/><p>Style-20%</p><br/><p>Temperament-15%</p><br/><p>Camera Sense-25%</p><br/><p>Talent-20%</p><br/><p>The host read the average marks of all the competitors one by one, allowing the models to get a general idea of their own rank.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's total score was still 9.95, which was the highest. Unless there was some kind of accident, he would win the competition. Poking his cousin with his finger, Ou Qiang said in a low, excited voice, \"My brother, you are second. Second!\"</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen chuckled to himself. On second thought, he felt bitter. I would have been first if it wasn't for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The host started to read the list of the winners. All the models waiting backstage were listening nervously.</p><br/><p>\"First, I\u2019ll announce the top 10 female contestants. No.3 Jiang Qinqin, No.21 Li Xiaoli...\"</p><br/><p>The girls yelled in both sadness and happiness.</p><br/><p>\"It's you! Get on the stage quickly!\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn... I wasn't selected.\"</p><br/><p>Ten beautiful girls walked on the stage and stood in a line to show their most brilliant smiles to the audience. The host went on, \"The top 10 male models are... No. 20 Ouyang Fen... No.21 Qin Guan... Please come on the stage!\"</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen got on the stage with red eyes. Thank god my nose isn\u2019t red. The male models formed a second line along the left side of the stage. The host was about to announce the individual awards. At the sight of the list, she seemed taken aback. Is there a mistake on the list? Forget it, I'll just read it.</p><br/><p>\"The prize for the most stylish model goes to No.21 Qin Guan... The prize for the best performance on the T stage goes to Qin Guan... The most popular prize goes to Qin Guan... The best potential prize goes to Ouyang Fen (finally a different winner)... The Chief Editor of \"Models\u2019\" Magazine will present the prizes to the winners!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They all expressed their heartfelt love for the model. Despite this honor, Qin Guan remained a strict, honest professional. This was the reason behind his success.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was paid one million for his work. He stuffed the cheque in his pocket to ease the pain caused by the two small jewellery cases. These were his prey at the Diamond headquarters.</p><br/><p>He loved the jade bracelets so much... They were as green as a pond in the forest. He bought a dark green one for his mother and a light green one for Cong Nianwei. He loved his job!</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The happy days passed quickly as Qin Guan finished reading the tall pile of scripts. When he looked up, he saw the latest Forbes ranking list on his desk.</p><br/><p>2005 Chinese Celebrity List</p><br/><p>1st place: Yao Ming, 150 million</p><br/><p>2nd place: Qin Guan, 130 million</p><br/><p>3rd place: Zhang Ziyi, 37 million</p><br/><p>4th place: Liu Xiang...</p><br/><p>One year ago, he had not made the top 10, but now he was second! The only one ahead of him was Yao Ming, who was a Chinese NBA superstar. Nearly everyone in China knew his name.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang, who had been a nobody one year ago, beat other stars like Li Lianjie, which showed the national pride of the Chinese.</p><br/><p>The list was not that important to Qin Guan, as his fame was big enough for his status. Next, he picked up the fortune ranking list with interest.</p><br/><p>The bottom limit for the 2005 list was 500 million RMB. There were 396 Chinese citizens who had met that requirement. Qin Guan found his own name quickly. It was among three other capable entrepreneurs.</p><br/><p>This was an honor reserved for industrialists and real estate businessmen, not superstars that made quick money. Everyone on the list had been a benefactor of their country.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was happy about his decision. He had relied on his QC accounting firm, and when that had gotten on the right track, he had founded his own entertainment company. If he hadn't acted right, he would have been considered an outsider by the rest of the circle.</p><br/><p>He also found two acquaintances on the list. The Wang Brothers had ranked 396th. Huayi hadn't entered the market by that time, so the private film company had earned the final seat on the list for their effort.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to the first page to check out the guys at the top. In 2005, Huang Guangyu and Ding Lei had fought over the first place. Two different family groups had taken the first and second place. It was a time for lonely heroes. The rising new industries were challenging the old families.</p><br/><p>In two years, old industries, such as aluminium and steel, would surrender to terrible new industries, including the real estate and internet industry. They would sadly have to leave their high spots on the list.</p><br/><p>What should I do? My way is different than theirs. Qin Guan had no idea what to do, for he had no plans of taking over the commercial industry. He suddenly looked around and smiled proudly.</p><br/><p>Wow! I'm rich now. I can buy double portions of anything I want to eat! I can have one portion and throw the other one away!</p><br/><p>As the overnight millionaire was about to kiss the list, a knock on the door scared him. He straightened his clothes and sat up properly. \"Come in, please.\"</p><br/><p>Wang entered anxiously. \"Qin Guan, a disaster is about to take place! Director Lang Kun wants to talk to you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that the general director of the previous Spring Festival Gala? What does he want?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not about a new film. He is still the director this year.\"</p><br/><p>\"He shouldn't have come here then. I didn't sign up for the gala. I have nothing to talk to him about.\"</p><br/><p>\"You were originally planning on ignoring it, but you made headlines right before the Spring Festival!\"</p><br/><p>\"How? What did I do?\"</p><br/><p>\"Look at this!\"</p><br/><p>Wang turned on her laptop. All the business news websites were focused on the recent Forbes lists. Qin Guan was on both lists, which had made all his fans go crazy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

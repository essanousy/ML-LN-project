Getting money from people was just like killing their parents though. Qin Guan had eight houses in Dongzhimen, so his only goal was to make money. Otherwise, he wouldn't have bought those shabby houses. He could have simply invested his money in an apartment downtown and gotten it back in a few years.</p><br/><p>This investment could bring him 20 times that profit though, so it was certainly worth his effort. Qin Guan was a money grubber after all.</p><br/><p>He acted first and told Sister Xue afterwards. She was one of the people who knew him the best, so he got her into trouble. Yin Changtao had followed Sister Xue back to China, surrendering to the appeal of the Chinese beauty. He was currently washing their socks in the bathroom.</p><br/><p>\"Who's that, honey?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Judging by her tone, Yin could tell that his boss had done something terrible.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>\"He provoked Wang Jianlin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is Wang Jianlin?\"</p><br/><p>\"A rich man!</p><br/><p>\"So is Qin Guan...\"</p><br/><p>You are too reasonable for me to argue with you.</p><br/><p>Actually, Yin had no idea about the current situation in China. He was just focused on fashion and design. Suddenly, Sister Xue was enlightened. Wait, this is not bad. We could do so much more about this matter!</p><br/><p>Sister Xue rushed into the bathroom and kissed Yin's bare head.</p><br/><p>\"You are a genius, darling! And I'm not just talking about design! You must be tired. Leave this to me!\"</p><br/><p>Yin caressed his own head happily, leaving some soap bubbles on it. Sister Xue burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Most people were asleep late at night, but there were some people who had to work. Wherever one was, that's where their home was too.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had a good night's sleep that night. In the morning, the sunshine greeted him brightly. It seemed like a good day.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue's call came just in time. As expected, she had good news for him. The man he wanted to meet was also eager to meet him. Both sides chimed in happily and made an appointment for the same day.</p><br/><p>They were not able to agree on a meeting place though. Wang Jianlin preferred the traditional Chang'an Club, while Qin Guan liked the American Club, a place where overseas immigrants and newly rich people liked to get together.</p><br/><p>Although both clubs were in the capital, they attracted very different groups of people. The men smiled meaningfully at the difference. A conflict between the new and the old emerged as more and more young people joined the ranks of the rich and powerful.</p><br/><p>They needed to find a location that suited their different backgrounds and financial status. Nothing would be more suitable than ancient China.</p><br/><p>They naturally chose No. 51 in the Xirongxian Alley of the Xicheng District.</p><br/><p> The China Club was a private lounge located in an ancient building on the Chinese mainland. It was its specialties and rich historical atmosphere that attracted its members, half of whom were CEOs of big domestic enterprises. The other half were foreign CEOs and ambassadors. The club was a perfect combination of modern and ancient elements, as well as oriental and occidental culture.</p><br/><p>The two men met in the luxurious building with the blue-gray tiles, carved beams, palace lanterns and ancient locusts.</p><br/><p>Good wine was poured into phosphorescent jade cups before toasts were made. Old people were wary of young people. There could be no friendship between the two generations, but Wang still admired the young man.</p><br/><p>By the time the meeting was over, both of them had gotten what they wanted.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left the club with a clear head. Chen Kang, who was good at judging a situation, appeared at his side, taking advantage of this chance to show his abilities.</p><br/><p>As soon as he'd gotten Qin Guan's private number, Chen had called Sister Xue and gotten appointed as Qin Guan's counselor. Now he was filling out an application form on Qin Guan's behalf in China Club. On their way back, Sister Xue and Qin Guan talked about the meeting in the car.</p><br/><p>\"I didn't expect Wang to be such an easy-going man.\"</p><br/><p>\"He is really clever. We'll be making profit for him.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan leaned against the back of the seat comfortably. Suddenly, he recalled something.</p><br/><p>\"He has made the wrong move. Chen Kang failed at his job. The price will go up sooner or later. He is not an idiot. If he loses one house, he will have to maximize his profit on the other houses. Otherwise, he wouldn't have changed his attitude. He knows that I own 20% of the property of this project after all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Withdrawing capital from circulation in advance is the most important thing for a land agent. A few millions is not much for him, but it's enough for him to start planning his next project.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue nodded. She was still worried about the old man though.</p><br/><p>\"Be careful. Don't spend too much on new buildings. The demolition has not been completed yet, but you signed a contract for an advance delivery. Besides, you have never invested in stores before. Why are you so confident about Wang's project?\"</p><br/><p>\"In my opinion, you are just paying for the new houses of the alley residents.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

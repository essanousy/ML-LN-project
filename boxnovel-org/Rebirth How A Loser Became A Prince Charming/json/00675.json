His cup fell down on Chen's knees, spilling hot water and tea leaves. He didn't pay attention to the cup though. He just cried out, \"What a good way to make money! You should have told me earlier!\"</p><br/><p>Chen was extremely annoyed with him.</p><br/><p>\"Piss off! The auction began earlier. The deadline expires today.\"</p><br/><p>Chen shot a supercilious look at the guy screaming on the couch and buried his head in his hands. He had good reason to be depressed. He had just turned down an important activity.</p><br/><p>I'd better wait for Qin Guan outside. He will check in with us today.</p><br/><p>It was a lucky day for the people waiting for the auction, who were all watching the timer on the screen. They had all heard and shared the news thanks to their friends within the circle. The Chinese billionaires were watching on the secret website. They came from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore... Even from Vietnam and Thailand.</p><br/><p>They were clear about the details of each role, as well as the auction regulations. The highest bidder would win.</p><br/><p>The currency of the internet auction was the American dollar, so all offers were converted to dollars by the platform, according to the instant ratio.</p><br/><p>The first role was a waitress who would serve Qin Guan. The second one was a rich woman who would go to the feast with Zhou Xue. The last one was a member of the film crew. The first and last one could also be played by men.</p><br/><p>The fierce competition surprised the technicians of the website. Fortunately, the crew had abundant financial support and the website was used exclusively by rich people. Otherwise, it would have collapsed due to the large amount of registrations and the continuous bids.</p><br/><p>It was all Qin Guan's fault. The bidders were all familiar with the handsome model from the fashion weeks, jewellery auctions and luxury product ads, so they were eager to see him in person and confirm the existence of such extreme beauty.</p><br/><p>Thus, they all spent their gold without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The first role had attracted everyone's attention, so its value kept increasing. The starting price had been one dollar, but 10 minutes before the auction ended, it had reached 58,888 dollars.</p><br/><p>Of course, those old rich guys wouldn't act in the film personally. They all had a group of sobbing daughters or concubines who wanted the part, so the billionaires would just visit the set as relatives.</p><br/><p>Tick tock, tick tock... When the final moment came, the role's value went up like crazy.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>Time was up. The button dimmed right on time. The slow bidders couldn't press it down anymore. The final price was 88,888.</p><br/><p>Superstitious Chinese rich men loved that number too much. The most attractive role had just been cast.</p><br/><p>In a luxurious house in Hong Kong, a pretty girl with long hair hugged her bearded father and kissed him on the cheek. Qin Guan, I'm coming!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a young man threw his computer mouse away. F*ck!</p><br/><p>The rising storm under the deep waters of the Hong Kong entertainment circle was beyond Qin Guan's reach. He had just arrived on set and joined forces with Sister Xue. His team, which included his stylist, assistants, secretary and professional manager, appeared before the Hong Kong film makers in a formidable array. There were more than 20 people in total.</p><br/><p>Actually, if they had been in any other country, Sister Xue wouldn't have presented such a large army. This was Hong Kong though. There were capable people everywhere. Most people looked down upon actors from the Chinese mainland, not realizing that Hong Kong films were going downhill.</p><br/><p>As an experienced agent, Sister Xue knew this all too well. Although Qin Guan had gone there at their invitation, he still had to have a large number of soldiers with him. Otherwise, he would suffer.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the four strong men standing behind him. They were wearing black suits and they all had the same buff figure and murderous expression.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan craned his neck towards Sister Xue. \"Are they our bodyguards? Where did you get them?\"</p><br/><p>\"Before I left Beijing. Guan Jian got them for you as a gift.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was stunned. \"Even dragons could not scare these men,\" Sister Xue whispered to him. \"They came to Hong Kong from the mainland and became influential here. At least you would be able to escape safely though.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew nothing about the Hong Kong entertainment circle, but he was very open-minded. He trusted his friends. They would never do him any harm.</p><br/><p>He just laughed at Sister Xue's escape tactics as Director Chen walked up to him leisurely, surrounded by his own large group of people.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

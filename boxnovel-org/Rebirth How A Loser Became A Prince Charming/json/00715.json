The interior of the chocolate factory had taken them nearly a week to build.</p><br/><p>It looked like a child's dream world. The lawn was made of green candy, and the fruit was made of hard red candy. There were also red-and-white rainbow sticks and white cream that served as clouds. Everything was made of candy. Even the slow-flowing river was made of liquid chocolate.</p><br/><p>That factory was the dream place of children all over the world.</p><br/><p>The story began with Qin Guan. This character was quite different from the previous ones he had portrayed. Willy Wonka was a freak that had remained isolated from the world for 20 years. He had only opened the factory again because of his love for candy, but he didn't really trust anyone. No one knew his real motivation.</p><br/><p>Tim loaded the expensive film into the camera as he waited for the actors to get into position. Finally, they started filming.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Qin Guan had to use his facial muscles in such strange ways. Every word he delivered felt like it was not coming from a common man.</p><br/><p>After being silent for a long time, Willy Wonka had forgotten the correct meaning of words. When the naughty children behaved badly, a strange expression appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>He grimaced with a fierce expression in his eyes. Frowning, he stopped the kids with a shaking finger.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you so short?\"</p><br/><p>They all turned their heads around and answered angrily, \"Because we are kids! You must have been just as short when you were young!\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\" Qin Guan told them proudly. \"I was tall as a child. I always wore a tall hat. I never took it off!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a meaningful smile appeared on his face for the first time. His pale face couldn't cover his good looks, and his white gloves, stick and purple velvet suit made him look mysterious.</p><br/><p>One of the parents, who was the mother of the cheerleader, focused on Qin Guan. She ogled at him and straightened her chest, while he tried to find a place to hide. He was not very familiar with humans.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his perfect body language and dramatic expression, Qin Guan performed well during the simple scene. The line delivery was just as perfect. The 10 actors cooperated well and avoided making any mistakes.</p><br/><p>Some lines were repeated, as some supporting actors failed to keep up with Qin Guan's high speed.</p><br/><p>The only retake caused by Qin Guan was during his reaction shot. He looked like a vampire with that makeup, which made him much too beautiful for the role.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless at the mistake. The reaction shot had originally not been included in the script. He shot a complaining look at the director, but Tim ignored him.</p><br/><p>Tim Burton, whose hairstyle made him look like Einstein, knocked on the board again. All the actors collapsed at the sound. The director was very strict, but they worked really hard, so they managed to get half-way through the film in a few days.</p><br/><p>There was no fighting or romance in the film, but even the supporting characters had plenty of lines. Most of the characters appeared together in the same scene, so the actors had to do their own job well while they paid attention to the others.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She was so excited that her tongue was tied. \"I'll do it immediately. Chen Kang and Han Zhujiu will arrive tomorrow. Shall I book a flight for the day after tomorrow?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's up to you. I trust you.\"</p><br/><p>What a sweet talker!</p><br/><p>Wang returned to her office with tears in her eyes, willing to bear the burden of hard work. Meanwhile, Qin Guan lay in bed thinking about his friends. He fell asleep with a strange smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Destiny is wonderful. I know both Nicholas Tse and Li Yapeng. Am I taking pleasure in their misfortune? I should just go to sleep already!</p><br/><p>After a good night's sleep, he felt refreshed. Without the burden of work, he was able to relax during the trip to Thailand. Soon, he and his team arrived in Thailand and met Xie's servants at the airport.</p><br/><p>Yes, the family had had its own servants for generations. Although this was 2006 and all humans were equal, this was a common occurrence in Thailand. In South-East Asia, most rich men, especially in the business and entertainment circle, were Chinese.</p><br/><p>This had nothing to do with Qin Guan though, who was just enjoying the delicious food and beautiful beach. Xie Hanren had told him to visit the beach in Pattaya, watch a splendid she-male show, taste the cheap fresh seafood and enjoy the exotic floating market.</p><br/><p>Xie's mansion was not located in Bangkok, which was a crowded, smelly city. It was actually in Pattaya, which had been flourishing lately. Pattaya was about 150 kilometers from Bangkok and it was famous for the longest and most beautiful coastline in Thailand, as well as its American naval base.</p><br/><p>Thailand had been the only independent country in the history of all the small nations of South-East Asia. It had been America's landing location during World War II, so the base had remained intact. It was concealed during that time of the year, as the US would usually send two or three troops of veterans there for training.</p><br/><p>As a result, the rich men living in that area felt very safe.</p><br/><p>Xie's family was clustered on a small hill in Pattaya, far away from the tourist area. The largest, most gorgeous villa belonged to Xie's mother. The Thai style villa had golden exterior walls.</p><br/><p>To Qin Guan, it looked like a nouveau riche house, but in Thailand, this was actually a symbolic look.</p><br/><p>The servants who picked Qin Guan up from the airport could speak fluent English. They made an introduction about every member of the Xie family and then turned towards the beautiful view of Pattaya. When they reached Xie Hanren's villa, Qin Guan experienced a luxury that only the richest, most powerful people in the world were privy to.</p><br/><p>Unlike the elegant Arabian villa he had been to before, this villa was a combination of the best, most expensive things in existence.</p><br/><p>The garden was designed in English style. All the lawns and trees were trimmed and arranged into a simple labyrinth for children. All along the path to the entrance were two lines of European sculptures that depicted strong soldiers holding shields and spears. The sculptures took one back to the Renaissance Era.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan seated himself in the exotic hall and tasted the traditional Chinese tea, Xie rushed downstairs to meet him. He was an honest man wearing golden-framed glasses.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry I kept you waiting, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

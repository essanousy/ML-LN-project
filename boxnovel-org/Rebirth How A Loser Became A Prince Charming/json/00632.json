They knew nothing about their scholarships in America or their careers.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's parents had made a big fortune thanks to Qin Guan. They had a large amount of money in their bank account, so they had decided to spend some gold on getting their son a matrimonial house. The residents of Y city believed that a new house was necessary for a couple to get married.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, Cong Nianwei and their parents arrived at Financial Street, where the famous Huarong Department was located. It was only a few hundred meters away from the subway station and across the street from the international Beijing No. 4 High School, which was a popular school district with convenient transportation. An inch of land in that area was worth an ounce of gold. </p><br/><p>It was the best place to invest in if one wanted to rent their house out or live in it. Because of the high prices, the building sales center was functioning perennially, even though the first residents had been living there for more than six months.</p><br/><p>All the real estate agents would keep some good houses at hand. They were actually looking ahead, as the prices had increased from 15,800 to 21,100 per square meter.</p><br/><p>The high prices obstructed sales, but they made money from the total difference.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome!\" Four salesmen bowed deeply before them as if they were Japanese.</p><br/><p>When they looked up, Qin Guan couldn't stand the flattering expression in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Let me serve them!\"</p><br/><p>\"You said you were busy today, Dong. Go ahead and do your job!\"</p><br/><p>\"I need these clients! I have to buy milk powder for my son, Elder Sister!\"</p><br/><p> \"I know you are single!\"</p><br/><p>They all left their integrity and morality at home.</p><br/><p>All families wanted to buy a matrimonial house. In most cases, parents used all their hard-earned money to buy a house for their only child. That house would serve as a happy nest for the young couple in the future. </p><br/><p>According to the manager's speculation, the young couple had to have decent jobs. Usually it was the parents who paid for the down payment and the children who paid for the loan.</p><br/><p>\"Follow me, please!\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman led them through the gate with an elegant posture. They used the elevator to get to their destination.</p><br/><p>\"It's a standard house with three bedrooms and a living room facing south and north. There is also an independent kitchen and a bathroom with two toilets...\"</p><br/><p>The manager opened the doors for them one by one. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei fell in love with the house.</p><br/><p>It had wooden floors, an elegant kitchen design, a reasonable amount of furniture and a large balcony that could hold two deck chairs. The surrounding facilities were perfect too. After the house had been ventilated and cleaned, there would be no pungent smell lingering inside.</p><br/><p>If he had been buying the house as an investment, Qin Guan would have just signed the contract without looking carefully at it, but their parents considered it important, as they would be living there after they got married.</p><br/><p>The manager waited for them quietly as they looked around the house, only speaking when they wanted to ask a question. Her sales strategy impressed their parents.</p><br/><p>\"I noticed that there are four houses on the same floor. There is one elevator for every two houses, right?\" Qin Guan's mother asked curiously, squeezing her handbag.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"They are the same houses with a flipped structure, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Could we have a look at the other house as well?\"</p><br/><p>The manager, who was a cunning woman, deduced that Qin Guan's mother was the decision-maker of the family. She was happy to grant her request.</p><br/><p>\"Of course,\" she answered softly. \"If you have time, we could pay a visit to the other side.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay...\" Everyone followed her out.</p><br/><p>The two doors were close to each other, so they strode over to the other house easily.</p><br/><p>\"Manager, this is a new client. I just showed them the house. Are you finished?\" Another salesman was leading some clients out.</p><br/><p>\"Hi! What a coincidence! How are you, Director Liu?\"</p><br/><p>The man following the salesman was Director Liu, whom Qin Guan had met at the Jun Wang Fu Restaurant. A plump woman was behind them, talking in a dramatic voice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

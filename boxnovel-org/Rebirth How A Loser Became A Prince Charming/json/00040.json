I must have been blind to be your girlfriend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her ex-boyfriend\u2019s friends were taken aback and turned to look at him.</p><br/><p>He seemed a little anxious as he said to the leader urgently, \u201cThe bitch is slandering me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader hesitated a little before he put down his iron tube. Pointing to Guli's ex-boyfriend, he said to Ye Dong, \u201cI have no idea who is right here. All I know is that he\u2019s my friend, and you\u2019re not. I believe him.\u201d \u201c</p><br/><p>Guli\u2019s ex-boyfriend was so glad, he raised his chin arrogantly and looked at her proudly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew that things would get bad that day. He looked at the girls again. He was worried about them getting injured.</p><br/><p>The unfair fight was about to begin. Li Jie suddenly walked out from behind the crowd. Pointing at the strong man\u2019s nose, he said in an imposing manner in his Sichuan Province accent, \u201cF*ck you, idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>The strong man looked confused with what he had said. Li Jie took advantage of his confusion and jumped into action. Using his flexible short figure, he ran under the strong man's armpit like a cunning snake moving out of its hole.</p><br/><p>He rushed through crowd, jumped out of the ring of encirclement and reached the street outside Typhoon Shelter. Finally, he disappeared into the flow of cars.</p><br/><p>Well done! Li Jie had made a successful escape. Let's stand up together and applaud him for his courage!</p><br/><p>The atmosphere insite had gotten strangely silent. Some onlookers couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was left speechless when a small ball of soil flew in from outside, accurately hitting the leader of the gang on the head.</p><br/><p>It bounced off his hair and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan laughed. They all looked and saw Li Jie with leaves of Chinese ilex on his body, a pile of soil in his arms and a small ball of soil in his hand.</p><br/><p>They immediately knew where the soil had come from. Before the leader could say anything, Li Jie threw a second ball.</p><br/><p>You could tell he was a straight-A student. After calculating accurately all contributing factors, including the distance between the two of them, the acceleration of gravity, the parabolic inertial and so on, his aim was spot on.</p><br/><p>The second ball hit the leader's hair again. \u201cYou bastard!\u201d Veins appeared on the guy\u2019s temple as a third ball flew over.</p><br/><p>There was a loud, clear sound as it hit him.</p><br/><p>Everyone was surprised by the sound. The third ball had been quite large in size, but how could it have produced a sound like that?</p><br/><p>The ball of soil fell down and rolled on the floor. As the soil on the surface fell away, the stone inside was exposed.</p><br/><p>The leader shouted angrily at Li Jie, \u201cYou bastard! You dare hide a stone inside? Stay right there! Don\u2019t run!\u201d</p><br/><p>Forgetting his original plan, the leader chased Li Jie with his iron tube. Some of his best friends followed.</p><br/><p>Five or six out of the 30 of them disappeared. Qin Guan looked helplessly at Li Jie, who ran away after attacking.</p><br/><p>His enemies looked even more helpless. They stared at the ex-boyfriend and seemed to be asking him silently, \u201cWho are they indeed? And why can\u2019t they follow fighting protocol?\u201d</p><br/><p>They would have to stretch their definition of fighting protocol. Liu Xiaoyang jumped in and said, \u201cHey, I haven\u2019t even said anything yet. Do you sons of bitches even know the rules?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pointing to the people opposite him, he went on, \u201cThis is a business place. If the waiter called the police, everyone would get into trouble. According to the rules, we shouldn't hurt innocent bystanders. Let's take this outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their opponents didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble, either. All of them went out of the Typhoon Shelter and walked to the edge of the road. The two parties were at a stalemate. Mu Lejiang asked the girls to leave.</p><br/><p>Ayimina was a little worried, and Guli didn't want to hide from her problems. Qin Guan and the other boys persuaded them to go to their campus so they could ensure the girls\u2019 safety.</p><br/><p>Realizing that the girls were about to leave, Guli's ex-boyfriend prepared to block them. His aim was his ex-girlfriend.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang was at the peak of his excitement. He wouldn\u2019t let the chief culprit go. He blocked the ex-boyfriend, pointed to the group and asked, \u201cHey, all of you, do you know the rules here in the capital? You have to declare your opponent first!\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked like a middle school student with his baby fat and short arms and legs, but he acted like he was the Godfather. They all laughed so loudly, they nearly dropped their weapons.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's roommates looked at each other to decide whether they stood a chance. Qin Guan pulled Liu Xiaoyang from behind and shouted loudly, \u201cRun! Scatter!\u201d</p><br/><p>They all turned around and ran in different directions. The 20-plus people looked at each other and finally at Guli\u2019s ex-boyfriend.</p><br/><p>He looked quite anxious. I called so many people for help. Is it over already?</p><br/><p>The rest of them were thinking to themselves, It\u2019s not like we know the guy, we just came here because our leader told us to.</p><br/><p>Grinding his teeth, the ex-boyfriend said, \u201cLet\u2019s chase them separately.\u201d They divided into groups of four and five and followed their opponents. As for the ex-boyfriend, he headed to Guli's college instead. He had shrewdly foreseen that he would take a beating if he stayed.</p><br/><p>There was a long distance between Qin Guan and his pursuers, which made things easier for him. After hiding several times, he had shaken almost everyone off. There were only two people following him when he arrived at the Red Star Bar.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed the door open and found Cong Nianwei sitting at the table closest to the bar. She was listening to the bar singer playing folk music while she rested her face on her hands.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan plopped down on a chair by the table. He let out a relieved breath and clicked his fingers to summon the waiter, \u201cA bottle of Budweiser Beer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gee, Qin Guan, you\u2019re so relaxed. There are two people chasing you, and you\u2019re in the mood for beer? The two men entered the bar holding an iron tube and two wooden clubs.</p><br/><p>They spotted Qin Guan as soon as they went in. They got ready to give him a lesson. Before they could step forward though, they were pressed to the ground by the people sitting around the two tables by the door.</p><br/><p>All they could see was a thick golden chain swaying before their eyes, shining. The owner of the bar hit their heads, which were pressed against the floor, while he said fiercely, \u201cYou little jerks! Where are you from? You\u2019re so brave, huh? You dare try to make trouble in my bar? In Wang Hailiang\u2019s bar?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were both in a daze. How could the young guys have known who Wang Hailiang was? Qin Guan took a sip of his beer, lay down on the table and laughed secretly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Some of them were independent individuals, while others were representatives of different companies.</p><br/><p>This was Wang's time to shine. She did quite a good job as Qin Guan's agent, so he was able to hide in a corner with his drink instead of getting bored to death.</p><br/><p>An observant person could find him easily though. Qin Guan moved his butt shyly to make room on the marble stairs for a woman.</p><br/><p>\"You are always like this. You show up at the opening and disappear as soon as the party begins.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't feel ashamed. He just took a sip of his drink and shrugged. \"I have been in America for two years. I've gotten familiar with balls and cocktail parties.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chinese people prefer to lead a quiet life. This life is boring and noisy. I don't understand Americans. Why can't I be a handsome loner?\"</p><br/><p>Julia burst into laughter, spilling her cocktail all over the place. She pointed at Qin Guan, but failed to say anything. Finally, she let out a sigh and shared some news about the Golden Globes with him.</p><br/><p>\"The judges have decided.\" She pointed to some plain guys that were present at the ball. They were all surrounded by beautiful women. \"Those guys are some of them. Take a look yourself.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a doubtful look at them. They pretended to be calm around the women, but their eyes betrayed them. \"Those guys are judges?\" Qin Guan asked her.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, they are considered the trendsetters of the Oscars. The Oscars tend to be similar to the Golden Globes. PR agencies pay for their trips, entertainment, cab fares, drinks and women. Most of them are ordinary reporters, so the powerful companies impress them.\"</p><br/><p>Julia patted him on the shoulder. \"You don't need to worry about the Golden Globes. It's not your problem to solve.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at the true concern in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\"I'm not a football player. American actors are not nearly as popular as football stars.\"</p><br/><p>Julia stood up, leaving her empty cup on the stairs. Qin Guan heard her voice from afar.</p><br/><p>\"Be at ease!\"</p><br/><p>She was right.</p><br/><p>The Golden Globes were quite different from other award ceremonies. The event was more like a formal banquet for actors than a grand award ceremony.</p><br/><p>There was not even a real red carpet. Even if one took the distance between the stars' cars and the hall into account, the red carpet was still pitifully short.</p><br/><p>The 2005 banquet was held at the Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. The reporters only had 30 seconds and three meters to take pictures, starting from when the car doors opened.</p><br/><p>As a result, they had to block the way quickly with their cameras and microphones, press down their shutters hard and leave fast before the bodyguards arrived.</p><br/><p>That was the fate of every reporter at the Golden Globes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was a big contender, was stopped outside the hall. Han Zhujiu looked helpless in the crowd, so Qin Guan pointed to a car behind them. \"Jude Law is here!\"</p><br/><p>The pressure suddenly eased. Taking advantage of the situation, Han carved a path through the reporters. Thanks to the staff's help, they were able to find the organizing committee.</p><br/><p>Wang fixed Qin Guan's shirt and handed him his invitation. Qin Guan registered at the reception and entered the hall alone. Posting any news instantly on his website was the only way for his team to handle the situation.</p><br/><p>They had been given an independent cabinet to work in, so they could publish any news as soon as possible.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

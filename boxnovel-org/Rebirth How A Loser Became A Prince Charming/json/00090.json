Qin Guan unconsciously held the reins tight.</p><br/><p>The Troublemaker was running happily. The human on my back is really brave. He isn't even crying. If he can remain safe despite my unique skills, I\u2019ll recognize him as my equal.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the horse stopped. Qin Guan pressed himself tightly against its stomach and clenched the reins that kept him from falling off. Baiyin and Buhe caught up with them on their horses and saw that they were safe. Both of them sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>As they helped Qin Guan off the horse, Baiyin praised him, \"Good boy! You are good at riding. Even the Troublemaker has recognized your ability.\"</p><br/><p>Mongolian men admired heroes and their tough spirit. Baiyin and Buhe quickly accepted Qin Guan as one of their own. Meanwhile, Qin Guan tried to hold his tears back. I have two mosquito bites on my butt! You can have a try! My legs are hurting too!</p><br/><p>However, as he stared at the long face of the Troublemaker, who seemed to be smiling at him, Qin Guan wasn\u2019t feeling angry anymore. That horse is lovely. It admires me for my charm and ability.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was really proud of himself, and the Troublemaker was also happy. According to the standards of human beings, my little brother is a beauty.</p><br/><p>After the accident, Baiyin taught them how to run slowly on horseback, which Qin Guan had proved he could handle. The bumps on his bottom were proof enough.</p><br/><p>After all the models had mastered it, they returned to the gathering site, where the director, the photographer, and the other models were waiting for them.</p><br/><p>The protagonist of the photoshoot was a professional domestic steeplechase athlete the director had invited to represent the competition. He was among the best in China, but he was a green hand at modelling.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they all had to work as a team. As they were getting on their horses, the evil part of Ouyang Fen's heart was awakened.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was on a pretty black racing horse with white hair on its strong hooves. The horse looked like it was stomping in the deep snow. It was a superb animal.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen felt wronged when he looked at the aged horse he was riding. He rode up to Qin Guan and nudged him gently.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, why is your horse so beautiful? Would you exchange it with mine?\"</p><br/><p>It is a lot more pleasurable to share joy than enjoy something alone. The small evil part in Qin Guan's heart was also awakened.</p><br/><p>\"No problem! We can swap horses later,\" he answered without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen couldn't believe his own ears, but he fell in step with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>They reached the foot of a small mountain, where the grass was green and small flowers were scattered. A few lambs were munching on the grass leisurely.</p><br/><p>Following the contestant's instructions, the models formed a triangle.</p><br/><p>The blue sky, green grass, white lambs and handsome riders looked like a perfect painting through the camera lens. The photographer adjusted the height of the tripod and took the first series of photos from a distance.</p><br/><p>Then the models got off their horses and gathered behind the contestant, acting like his followers to set off his valiant, heroic upbringing. The second series of photos were close-up shots. Imagining the moment of his victory, the contestant smiled. His brown, sunburnt face was filled with happiness.</p><br/><p>The photographer knew how to guide a greenhand. His personal experience created the right vibe.</p><br/><p>Finally, he let everyone take a break. They had to finish the third series of photos before the temperature got too high.</p><br/><p>The third series would be the running shots. Qin Guan happily handed the Troublemaker's reins to Ouyang Fen, warning him, \"I wouldn't swap horses with me if I were you. My horse has a really bad temper. Only I can control it. You can consult with Baiyin and Buhe if you want.\"</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen was angry. Just as I expected. Qin Guan doesn\u2019t want to swap horses with me. Ouyang Fen grabbed the Troublemaker's reins. \"A greenhand like you can control the horse, but a veteran like me can't? You just don\u2019t want to swap with me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shrugged and backed off, but he dared not leave Ouyang Fen alone. He will blame me if there is some kind of accident. Ouyang Fen didn't care about the horse. Only I deserve such a handsome horse. I will stand out in the photos.</p><br/><p>The photographer asked everyone to mount their horses again. Ouyang Fen was planning on showing off his riding skills. He put one foot onto the pedal, but the Troublemaker suddenly raised its bottom and back legs, and Ouyang Fen fell off with his foot hanging from the pedal.</p><br/><p>Everyone was scared, but luckily the Troublemaker had not started running. Otherwise, Ouyang Fen would have died on that grassland.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

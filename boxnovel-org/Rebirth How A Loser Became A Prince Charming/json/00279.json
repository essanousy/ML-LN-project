The audience could find Qin Guan's voting number at both the beginning and the end. Viewers could see the cute film and learn about the voting platform.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s fan club had gotten angry, but the club was newly established. Their votes were inadequate for such a severe situation. The president of the club was a senior internet insider, who sent the link directly to influential moderators of the Haijiao and Goupu forums.</p><br/><p>The friendship among revolutionaries was deep. They were all used to being at the bottom together, so they gave a hand happily and put Qin Guan\u2019s video at the top of their posts.</p><br/><p>The posts attracted attention from curious users, who clicked on them and saw large photos of Qin Guan, followed by his VOGUE cover. The extreme clash of black and white, as well as its splendid, peaceful vibe, shocked people.</p><br/><p>The article was also exciting for young Chinese people. Their model couldn\u2019t lose to those foreign guys.</p><br/><p>Unity was power. Sister Xue, who was busy in her office, saw Qin Guan's ranking rise slowly.</p><br/><p>Ninth, eighth\u2026 Qin Guan stopped rising at midnight, when he reached the third place.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue let out a long breath. The difference between the top three was not that big. The final day would be essential for all the candidates.</p><br/><p> Shao\u2019s agent hung up the phone and let out a breath confidently. According to the statistics, Shao would definitely win if people kept voting normally.</p><br/><p>The case had been settled, Shao would continue his career. Besides, with that title, Fang would also benefit from his popularity. It would be easy for her. The happy ending of their romance would become a legend.</p><br/><p>For the sake of promotion, his agent had deliberately leaked information about the affair between Fang and Shao. If he won the competition, Fang would not care about it.</p><br/><p>The two of them were dreaming, totally ignoring the consequences the affair would have if they failed. Fang would be angry that she had been used as a weapon.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Qin Guan was still in a fierce competition with Zhitian Erzhi, a Japanese model. What was the fastest way to defeat the Japanese with a keyboard? Ask help from the headquarters of young Chinese men.</p><br/><p>Where were they?</p><br/><p>On forums about history, the military and politics.</p><br/><p>Zhitian was an arrogant guy. Students from Tsinghua University had sent information about him to Cong Nianwei, which had been sent by Qin Guan to his fan club.</p><br/><p>Zhitian said there was no fashion in China. Qin Guan who? Such posts appeared silently on forums, making the angry users explode.</p><br/><p>It was unacceptable! The news spread along with Qin Guan\u2019s link. More and more young people clicked in to vote for the Chinese boy.</p><br/><p> They didn\u2019t want to see the Japanese win.</p><br/><p>In half a day, Zhitian was far behind Qin Guan, who ranked second only to Shao Xiaobing.</p><br/><p>As he looked at the poll on the screen, Shao couldn\u2019t remain calm.</p><br/><p>Crack! His glass fell on the floor and shattered. Shao started shouting like crazy.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! You\u2019re haunting me everywhere! Why? I\u2019m the best! I\u2019m a fashion pioneer!\"</p><br/><p>Why can\u2019t my influence beat you?</p><br/><p>He stared at his agent with bloody eyes. \"Where are your companies? I have money! How much will it take? 100,000? 200,000? 300,000? Take my money and give me the title!\"</p><br/><p>He grabbed his agent by the collar, shaking him vigorously. The man was choking. He couldn't even breathe.</p><br/><p>\"Calm down, Shao!\"</p><br/><p> Shao slowly let him go.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s online voting! It relies on real IPs. Companies cannot fabricate those statistics. It\u2019s a fair competition.\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides, everyone is promoting themselves. Everyone is looking for votes. The more people vote, the better. It's too early for you to leave China. The audience just likes Qin Guan better.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brands and media prefer him too. That's reasonable. You have a broader market, but a weaker foundation.\"</p><br/><p>Besides, your foundation is about to collapse thanks to that woman.</p><br/><p>Shao fell on the couch, that rotten night playing back in his mind. He remembered his ambition and horror.</p><br/><p>I cannot give up! Covering his face, he told his agent, \"Use all our resources. There is still half a day left. I\u2019ll face Qin Guan head-on.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

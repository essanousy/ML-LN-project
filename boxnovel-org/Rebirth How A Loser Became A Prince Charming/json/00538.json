A Chinese guy had finally found his place among American stars.</p><br/><p>The whole process took only 10 minutes. The website confirmed all the true information about Qin Guan. An American blog belonging to him had been born.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that this was in late July 2003. Blogs had not been accepted by common people in China yet. Portal websites had not realized their value.</p><br/><p>Full name: Qin Guan</p><br/><p>Gender: Male</p><br/><p>Occupation: Student, actor, model</p><br/><p>Bio: He made his debut very young. In 1998, he won the New Face Competition. In 1999, he became a B-level model. He has represented many fashion brands in Asia and starred in numerous advertisements. In 2002, he came to America and was discovered by CK. He showed his extraordinary splendor during the New York Fashion Week. He was later discovered by famous Italian designer Giorgio Armani. He is currently an ambassador of Armani, Tiffany, Vacheron Constantin, L\u2019 Oreal and other top international brands.</p><br/><p>Advertisements: Armani Fragrance series, L\u2019 Oreal, Cadillac and others.</p><br/><p>Achievements in Film and TV: He was discovered by Director Zhang Jizhong. He has acted in many Chinese period TV series and was deemed \"unparalleledly handsome\". He was later cast by Director Zhang Yimou in his film \"Heroes\", which was the start of his journey in the film industry. When everyone thought that this was it for him, he came to the US, where Director Gus offered him a part in his film \"Elephant\". This was his first leading role in a film.</p><br/><p>TV Series: \"The Legend of the Swordsman\"</p><br/><p>Films: \"Elephant\", \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", \"Mean Girls\"</p><br/><p>Awards: Winner of the 1998 Chinese New Face Competition, Best Actor Award Winner at the 56th Cannes Film Festival</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's past struggles were all presented to the public. His fans heard the news from Sister Xue and poured into the blog.</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations! I\u2019m so happy!\"</p><br/><p>\"We can finally learn about our idol\u2019s activities as fast as possible. No more gossip!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! I\u2019m tired of all those fake news circulating in the media!\"</p><br/><p>His fans were increasing rapidly. Some people who were attracted by other gossip websites, as well as the audience of Qin Guan's films, also visited the blog.</p><br/><p>The team was watching the number of fans increase silently. One thousand, two thousand... The increasing number slowed down until it reached more than 60,000.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s fans were attracted by his own popularity. If the stars he had cooperated with had promoted the new blog, then the number would have been even bigger.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei and Sister Xue were conservative though. It was not a good idea to boast about his blog before Qin Guan reached a higher commercial value.</p><br/><p>What they were worried about the most came true.</p><br/><p>The visitors of the blog were mainly film, TV and fashion fans who had visited Qin Guan's blog by chance.</p><br/><p>When they realized who he was, they got excited. He is the guy from that recent affair! The news spread as the audience gathered on the website.</p><br/><p>\"Stop working your magic on Britney! You just want to benefit from her popularity!\"</p><br/><p>\"Best Actor at Cannes? I\u2019ll take a look at his work!\"</p><br/><p>\"Go to hell! You just rely on your looks!\"</p><br/><p>The disharmony in the comment section shocked Vivian, who looked at Sister Xue helplessly. \"What should we do?\"</p><br/><p>Rongzhi rolled up his sleeves excitedly. He was the administrator of the blog. \"Leave it to me. I\u2019ll destroy their computers.\"</p><br/><p>Qu shook her head. \"Don't worry. Look at the response of our fans!\"</p><br/><p>After a short silence, Qin Guan's fans came back to their senses and began fighting back.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is worthy of Britney, Paris and Madonna!\"</p><br/><p>\"Based on what? His popularity and influence in America? He is a typical case of sensationalization!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! People who become famous through their romantic affairs don\u2019t stand the test of time!\"</p><br/><p>The fans gave uniform answers, guided by the president of Qin Guan\u2019s fan club.</p><br/><p>\"Come on! Shout with me! Why is Qin Guan the best?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because he is an angel fallen from Heaven! Look at his face!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Sister Xue arranged the content of the different sections with Rongzhi.</p><br/><p>\"Upload Qin Guan's cover photos and advertisement videos. Don\u2019t forget to give links for the most popular brands in Qin Guan's resume.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem...\" Rongzhi's fingers were dancing on the keyboard. When the warfare on the forum subsided, the users realized that the content had been updated.</p><br/><p>There were beautiful photos, fragments of advertisements and posters on the blog now. They occupied the whole screen when one clicked on them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

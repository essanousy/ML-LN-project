Qin Guan was too kind to compete with them, but he had no excuse to turn down the invitation.</p><br/><p>\"Really? Great!\"</p><br/><p>When he heard his positive response, the assistant director relaxed. He had fulfilled Lang Kun's dream and completed his task. He had to nail down Qin Guan to avoid a big delay.</p><br/><p>\"I'll send the song to you later. All the details, including the music, dancers and your part, will be in the attachment. We'll also send you the list of your partners. If you have cooperated with them before, it will make things easier. If not, don't worry about it. You can get to know each other during the rehearsal.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, thanks.\"</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan hung up, he suddenly realized he had been trapped. They had already discussed the final rehearsal. The guy seemed like a strict director. Should I prepare in advance?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan asked Wang to send him the program as soon as possible. He had decided to take the invitation seriously.</p><br/><p>Unlike Qin Guan, who had a very tight schedule, Man Wenjun's phone was silent. As a domestic pop singer, the gala would be the best chance for him to promote himself. His agent had contacted the organizing committee in advance and had been promised a spot at the event. If he was lucky enough, he might get a chance to sing in the choir or even alone.</p><br/><p>His dream was suddenly interrupted by a call.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, but our original choice accepted the invitation. You were just the backup plan. Should I check if there's a place for you in the choir?\"</p><br/><p>\"Can he participate in the pop song medley?\" his agent asked.</p><br/><p>\"Man Wenjun has released no popular work this year. The songs have to be popular. They are meant to kill time. Half the singers could have their act cancelled at any moment. We can't add one more singer. I'll check the choir for you. I'm busy now. Bye!\" he said and hung up.</p><br/><p>A solo had turned into a place in the choir... Man Wenjun's agent hung up the phone sadly and turned around to find Man sitting on the couch silently. The plain-looking man had not graduated from a professional school. He had climbed his way up from the bottom of society.</p><br/><p>He was famous for his voice, which was a fact that had limited his career. His appearance and few fans made his future look dim.</p><br/><p>Before his agent could figure out a way to comfort him, the silent guy spoke up.</p><br/><p>\"The original singer changed his mind?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who was it?\"</p><br/><p>God knew...</p><br/><p>The honest man smiled. \"I'm really curious about that guy. Could you please help me get a place in the choir? A short appearance is better than nothing. I'm afraid that people will forget about me. It's been such a long time...\"</p><br/><p>They won't. The answer choked in his agent's throat. He compromised with a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I'll tell them.\"</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan had reached the place where he would be meeting Fatty Gao.</p><br/><p>Yes, Fatty Gao was Gao Xiaosong. Actually, he was only a little plump, but his round face was extra big. The young man seemed like a tough fellow, but he was actually very easy-going. Qin Guan had maintained a long, steady friendship with him. When he had accepted CCTV's invitation, he had thought of Gao right away. Gao had replied positively.</p><br/><p>It was the end of the year, so musicians had plenty of free time. Gao had some time to chat. As soon as Qin Guan got out of the car, Gao pulled him to a private recording studio.</p><br/><p>Even though he was an unreliable man, Gao was strict about his music. He owned so much equipment that he could establish his own small record label. A group of weird men with long hair had become the backbone of underground music, just like the directors of the 6th generation had become the backbone of indie cinema.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Just pick up the bugs for me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay...\" The tutor surrendered his seat over to Qin Guan, who sat straight down before the piano and put his hands gently on the keys.</p><br/><p> Willow catkins started murmuring, and elves began dancing. Qin Guan's fingers moved as his body swayed with the rhythm.</p><br/><p> A fluent melody flew from the keys, lingering around the room. It sounded natural, yet poetic.</p><br/><p> When he played the last note, everyone was shocked. The greatest geniuses were often hidden ones. That Asian boy was gifted! He knew how to play without ever learning.</p><br/><p> The tutor was over the moon. Grabbing Qin Guan's hands, he said with quivering lips, \"You should be learning music, not acting in these stupid films...\" In his eyes, Qin Guan was a future world-class virtuoso.</p><br/><p> Watch your words before the crew, please.</p><br/><p> He was paid back for that statement. The strongest man in the crew threw him outside. Of course, he got paid first.</p><br/><p> The most difficult scene in the film had actually been the simplest one. Taking advantage of the spare time, the crew had lunch and rested.</p><br/><p> Working overtime cost a lot in the US. According to labor union regulations, there was a strict limit on the working hours and salary of the crew.</p><br/><p> Independent films didn't involve any processes like special effects or editing. Otherwise, the producer would never get his money back.</p><br/><p> Daytime was short in the winter. After a one-hour break, Gus organized all the crew.</p><br/><p> \"Attention, everyone! There's only one scene left. Cheer up! Tonight, Cara Gistro! My treat!\"</p><br/><p> All the men applauded. It was a rare invitation coming from that guy.</p><br/><p> When they found out what the scene was though, they realized they had been cheated. If the scene didn't go smoothly, they\u2019d never get that drink.</p><br/><p> Why?</p><br/><p> The scene involved a common element of indie films from all over the world: the forbidden love between two people of the same gender.</p><br/><p> Eric, the gloomy boy, had been suppressing his desire for sex. He was thirsty for the love of a man, not a woman. That strained plotline made the whole story interesting.</p><br/><p> Homosexuality, teenagers, school violence, shootings: all the elements of indie films were used in \"Elephant\" one after the other.</p><br/><p> The scene was taking place in the bathroom of Eric's house.</p><br/><p> American directors never borrowed shooting methods from the Chinese. Instead, they used scenes smartly to take real, but not exposing shots.</p><br/><p> Since they were both male, Qin Guan and Alex were naked in the bathroom. Neither of them felt awkward about it. </p><br/><p> The shower was on, and water was falling down. Only the two young men were in the room.</p><br/><p> \"Close the door. Lights on. Cameras ready! Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p> White mist was lingering around their naked bodies. Their clean skin looked blurry behind the glass.</p><br/><p> The slender one was Eric, and the stronger one was Alex. They looked at each other gently.</p><br/><p> \"We\u2019ll die today.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes, Alex. I have never kissed a person in my life.\"</p><br/><p> His voice was husky, but Qin Guan tried to suppress his desire. He was afraid of getting hurt. He was like a puppy waiting to be petted.</p><br/><p> The other boy didn't laugh at his sentiment. He slowly supported his arms against the wall.</p><br/><p> The camera behind the glass moved. The audience could only see Qin Guan's face and his blank eyes. His face looked weak, yet elegant.</p><br/><p> With his back turned to the camera, the boy with the golden hair opened his arms. His bare back, waist and tight bottom were indistinct under the disguise of the mist and the glass.</p><br/><p> It was more of a lure than a direct exposure.</p><br/><p> \"Me neither...\" The golden-haired boy leaned closer to Qin Guan. The young men\u2019s lips met before they were covered by the thick mist.</p><br/><p> The director and the crew re-arranged their clothes and stood up straight, waiting solemnly for the final lines.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

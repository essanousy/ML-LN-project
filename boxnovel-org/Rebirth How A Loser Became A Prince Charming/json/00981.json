Why was it turned into a soap opera?</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was a calm girl that never got frightened during a film. Now that she had finished her job at the Olympic Stadium, she would have more time to prepare for the wedding.</p><br/><p>Every woman looked forward to her wedding, as this was a grand event in a woman's life.</p><br/><p>In China, wedding ceremonies always began with the dress photos. Instead of the white dresses that women wore in Western countries, Asian women usually preferred red traditional Chinese outfits.</p><br/><p>The couple chose a day in March to take the photos, so that there would be enough sunshine.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's first job after the Spring Festival was really embarrassing. As he stood on the site, he caught himself feeling like a host of a children's TV show.</p><br/><p>In his opinion, the advertisement should have been just a simple group photo of him and the five Fuwa. The sponsors would have been so satisfied with his face that they would have paid no attention to anything else.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan watched in shock as five real-life Fuwa came out of the dressing room in large head pieces. Their heavy masks caused the Fuwa at the end of the line to fall over, which in turn caused the others to fall one by one like dominoes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was pinned beneath them.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! Qin Guan is under me!\"</p><br/><p>A hand stretched out between them in an effort to hold on to something.</p><br/><p>\"Are you stupid? Take off these masks!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone did as the director told them. When they helped Qin Guan up, the award-winning actor looked confused.</p><br/><p>These five guys seem really familiar.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan actually knew them. Due to the importance attached to the film, even the Fuwa, who would not reveal their faces during the film, were played by famous hosts and hostesses of children's programs.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qin Guan came back to his senses and recognized them, he smiled. He wanted to get to know this group of people, whose childish disposition still shone through their work. Although they were all middle-aged, they still looked like children.</p><br/><p>They were not just acting. The children in them still lived in their hearts.</p><br/><p>The five hosts, who got lost in Qin Guan's smile, smiled back like silly. The experienced director suddenly felt inspired. \"Film this,\" he whispered to the cameraman.</p><br/><p>He was right. It was a perfectly harmonious scene. All the Fuwa held their heads in their hands as they gathered around Qin Guan, who was the promotional ambassador. It felt like the mascots were giving him their blessing.</p><br/><p>The family of Olympic athletes was happy and harmonious.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

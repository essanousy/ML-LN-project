It should have been 1.4 million, not 5.6 million.</p><br/><p>Before he called his parents, Qin Guan suddenly remembered that Western Electricity had increased its stocks. He held 20,000 shares now.</p><br/><p>Oh, my! God has blessed me! I\u2019m a real millionaire! I don\u2019t need to f*cking study abroad. I could just stay at home in the US and wait for Cong Nianwei. I\u2019d be a good stay-at-home husband.</p><br/><p>He was just kidding. Qin Guan loved money. He put the card in his purse right away. He had enough money now, so he could invest it somewhere. He would still work to pay his tuition fees. He headed to A. M. to shoot his advertisements.</p><br/><p>It took him two hours to finish all three. Then he had to prepare for the biscuit ad right away. Adidas had said that they were working on the background and it might take them several days.</p><br/><p>The Xianqui biscuit set was an apartment.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to eat biscuits seriously as he watched TV. His partner this time was not a human being, but a dog.</p><br/><p>It was a lovely golden retriever with shining, smooth hair and a smiling face. It was a typical tame dog.</p><br/><p>It would have been the best dog if it didn't seize biscuits from Qin Guan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The advertisement required their cooperation. They had to eat their own food separately, but the dog kept rushing up to Qin Guan and taking the biscuits from his hand, embarrassing his trainer. It was a good boy. Its only flaw was that it was greedy.</p><br/><p>The trainer had brought its favorite beef biscuits, but the model was so good at his job that it made the dog ignore its own biscuits and turn to the biscuits in his hand.</p><br/><p>The director had a flash of inspiration. Go on! This may be even better!</p><br/><p>There was a great turmoil on set. Qin Guan and the dog were eating happily together, their heads touching. The trainer covered his face. I should have trained it more. What a shame! Is there any salt in those biscuits? Oh, no! That's harmful for pets!</p><br/><p>By the time the shooting was finished, Qin Guan and the dog\u2019s friendship had gotten as solid as a rock. They waved farewell at each other, unwilling to part ways. Qin Guan could see tears in Egg's eyes as he drove off.</p><br/><p>He was glad he had chosen that advertisement. The half-full box of biscuits in his trunk would last him and his roommates a month.</p><br/><p>Besides, he had collaborated with such a cute dog. What a nice day it had been!</p><br/><p>As the saying went though, whatever went up had to come down. The Western Electricity stocks dropped in several days.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's mother was ecstatic when she saw the woebegone crowd outside the bourse. The stock market was a big risk.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's uncle was really grateful. He had been laughed at by all his workmates when he\u2019d insisted on underselling the stocks according to Qin Guan's advice, and they had also made fun of him when he\u2019d decided to buy more stocks.</p><br/><p>Reality had proved him right though.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled proudly when his mother called him. It seemed that he had benefited again from his rebirth. Forget it, I should go to sleep. This millionaire has to work hard tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The following day, Qin Guan went out of A.M. proudly, holding a bag full of Adidas sample sacks.</p><br/><p>He dried his wet hair and drove off in the opposite direction of his college. It was not his style to deposit cash into a bank and wait to make profit. He would invest his money on property instead.</p><br/><p>Under the Dongzhimen Overpass, the streets were crowded with people and vehicles. Thanks to the general construction and development of the capital, there were construction sites everywhere.</p><br/><p>The inner street of Dongzhimen was like another world, even though it was in the same neighborhood.</p><br/><p>There were holes everywhere, and Qin Guan's car couldn\u2019t get though the Hutong. The residents had even built sheds and cooking benches on the road.</p><br/><p>The main reason for that was the fake moving news. Every time the residents heard the news, they would try their best to expand their habitable space in hopes of getting more compensation from the government.</p><br/><p>Imagination was good, but reality was cruel. They waited till the newly-built mansions blocked their sunlight, but there were still no definite news about moving.</p><br/><p>In the end, the area would be maintained as a historical site of the city, and the residents wouldn\u2019t be as lucky as those living across the street.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d have to live in those shabby, noisy houses for the rest of their lives. If they wanted to go to the bathroom, they\u2019d have to cross two streets. What a miserable life!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would finally use his money. Nobody knew that Wanda, one of the top real estate companies in China, had bought the place. Qin Guan fixed his eyes on the place where the Wanda Plaza would be in the future.</p><br/><p>A little while later, he was sitting with a real estate agent, drinking jasmine tea. The assistant was casting happy looks at him as the young agent was talking about the surrounding properties, saliva splashing around as he spoke.</p><br/><p>The charm of the man made Qin Guan enjoy his treatment. It was different compared to the time he\u2019d bought a car.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his cup of tea and waved at the young man to stop talking. He pushed the paperwork back and said, \"They\u2019re pretty good. Some of the houses are almost brand new. I have my own plans though. Is there anything in Dongnei for sale?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

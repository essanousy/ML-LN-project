XX, XXX, and XX attracted users with false news.\"</p><br/><p>That post was in the gossip section.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they were seen by internet users.</p><br/><p>\"Oh! He\u2019s a good boy and a straight-A student. I wonder if his girlfriend is sad about those news.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it must be annoying. I\u2019d be very sad if my boyfriend was having an affair.\"</p><br/><p>\"Actually, they were childhood sweethearts. It\u2019s rumored that Qin Guan refused a beautiful girl\u2019s affection without hesitation while in college.\"</p><br/><p>Poor Huang Jiajia...</p><br/><p>\"Really? Those websites are so evil!\"</p><br/><p>The voices supporting Qin Guan were getting louder and louder. Some talented people with time on their hands started to make a chart of the different news about Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Finally, they read the news on Soulang, which clarified the truth and told the story from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>Those websites had been fabricating news and attracting users by posting fake photos!</p><br/><p>The fighters on the Haijiao Forum were excited. Those radicals were famous for fighting demons and defending moral principles.</p><br/><p>They could start a fierce battle over a trifle, let alone over getting the hottest news.</p><br/><p>They knew the truth, so they had to fight!</p><br/><p>The battle started on the Haijiao Forum and quickly spread to the other websites.</p><br/><p>Their first aim was Jiulang. Plenty of Haijiaoers flocked in and gathered under the post about Kyoko and Qin Guan\u2019s affair.</p><br/><p>Using temporary IDs, they occupied the whole comment area and gradually took control of the entire entertainment section.</p><br/><p>The Jiulang website administrator was sleeping in his office, holding a cigarette in his mouth.</p><br/><p>By the time he woke up from his nap, the whole page had collapsed.</p><br/><p>He typed on his keyboard, his heart in his mouth, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>One after the other, all the websites except Soulang crashed.</p><br/><p>The administrator of Wangnan was confident though. They had bought the largest server in the market that year. He wasn\u2019t afraid of those internet mobs.</p><br/><p>As expected, the Haijiao Army met its first obstacle there.</p><br/><p>Posts were refreshed rapidly, but the function of the server was still unobstructed. As the fighters were discussing a counterplan, the administrator suddenly jumped up with wild eyes. He looked like he had been stamped on the tail.</p><br/><p>The homepage had fallen into enemy hands. All the links had disappeared, leaving only a warning in black and white: Defending Qin Guan is our life-long career!</p><br/><p>It had to be someone superior. The director wiped the sweat off his forehead. The technicians worked really hard, but failed to restore the homepage.</p><br/><p>\"What should we do?\"</p><br/><p>The director gritted his teeth. \"We can only report this to the boss.\"</p><br/><p>Many people lost sleep that night.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spent the day in bed, but Sister Xue informed him about the incident.</p><br/><p>He watched the drama online with keen pleasure, eating chicken legs and noodles at the same time.</p><br/><p>When Wangnan collapsed, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>It was Cong Nianwei. Qin Guan had texted her one hour earlier, but she had been at a lecture at the time.</p><br/><p>Her sweet voice improved his mood.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang, who had a chicken wing in his mouth, was shocked by Qin Guan\u2019s expression. The wing fell into his bowl, covering his face in soup.</p><br/><p>\"Did Wangnan really collapse, Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, but how do you know?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's evening and I\u2019m in my dormitory. You forget that QH is full of talented students. They could get information on all your family members with just one IP. I\u2019m a goddess here, so lots of strangers are eager to help me. I don't even need to ask them.\"</p><br/><p>I should be happy that my girlfriend is so popular, but...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nearly burst into tears. Thank god I didn't betray her, or I\u2019d die in countless strange high-tech ways.</p><br/><p>His heart still fluttering in fear, Qin Guan hung up. It's late, I should go to bed.</p><br/><p>He fell asleep soon, but some deeply troubled people were working overnight, the phones in their offices ringing again and again. They were discussing countermeasures.</p><br/><p>\"We have free speech. What shall we do?\" the staff members said one after the other.</p><br/><p>\"In my opinion, we should remove the articles. Without a target, they\u2019d have no reason to keep attacking us.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall we make a statement after removing them though? What if they attack other sections? Just think about Wangnan\u2019s fate.\"</p><br/><p>\"We can ask the PR department to make a written statement, telling them we have already dismissed the reporter.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good idea. Remove the articles first. Then keep observing.\"</p><br/><p>They took urgent action as more and more users gathered on the Haijiao Forum like a rolling snowball. The Haijiao administrator was confused as well.</p><br/><p>He knew the server well enough. With such a large flow, their own page would collapse soon. It was because of those fighters. They had attracted curious users from the websites that were under attack.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

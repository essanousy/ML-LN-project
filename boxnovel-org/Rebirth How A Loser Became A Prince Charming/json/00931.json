Qin Guan shrugged awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, the organizers gave me a chance to be here, but only for the red carpet event. Maybe they thought I hadn't taken enough photos this year. I'll have to work harder to win an Oscar next year.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" The reporters were disappointed.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was always aware of his status though. As soon as he reached the end of the red carpet with Director Zhang, he escaped under the giant golden figure to avoid taking any pictures. Then he said goodbye to Zhang Weiping and returned to New York.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan boarded a flight to Vancouver, where he would begin filming soon. His new film was called \"Night at the Museum\" and it was produced by 20th Century Fox.</p><br/><p>The New York Museum cherished its exhibits too much, so the crew had failed to get permission to film inside the real museum. Instead, they had built a copy of it.</p><br/><p>The collection of the New York Museum included everything, from celebrity sculptures to dinosaur fossils. It had everything one could expect to find.</p><br/><p>As soon as the curator had found out about the dangers of having a film crew there, he had rejected the director's offer without hesitation, even though he had received a call from the mayor.</p><br/><p>The mayor apologized to the crew and handed them his campaign flier, with the hope that they would still vote for him.</p><br/><p>The director was a straightforward man, so he had decided to build a new museum.</p><br/><p>In order to save money, the reconstruction would not take place in Hollywood, but in Vancouver, which had been nicknamed \"Northern Hollywood\".</p><br/><p>Vancouver, which was north of Seattle, was the most developed city of the Canadian film industry. Canada was a country that was greatly influenced by the United States.</p><br/><p>The city's geographical location and pleasant climate had attracted countless immigrants from all over the world.</p><br/><p>The Chinese population in Vancouver had reached 2.3 million. The city was deeply influenced by the United States and linked to the industrial sector in Seattle. A large industrial town was located around the city. Its residents shared the same worry as the Chinese, which was the high real estate prices.</p><br/><p>In 2007, the housing prices in Vancouver were second only to Tokyo's. This only applied to ordinary people though. 20th Century Fox would actually save 20%-30% on its budget.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Qin Guan headed to the shooting site leisurely, feeling completely refreshed. He had heard the news about the Oscars. As expected, Director Zhang had not left empty-handed. The American film critics and media had found the film pretty good, so the rare Chinese film had won two awards. This was basically Hollywood's indirect way of accepting the film.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yimou's film had won the Best Costume Design Award and the Best Cinematography Award.</p><br/><p>In combination with the film's box office in China, the Chinese blockbuster had done pretty well.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt reassured. Now he was in the right mood to check out his new working place.</p><br/><p>The crew had invested 10-15 million dollars on the film. Of course, the actors' salaries were not included in that amount.</p><br/><p>Big companies like Fox, Columbia and Warner spent a specific amount of money on new scripts. Any creative idea from all over the world could intrigue them. Outstanding scripts poured into their offices every day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

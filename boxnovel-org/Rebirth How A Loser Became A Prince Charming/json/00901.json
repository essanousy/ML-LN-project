He had always thought that Cong Nianwei loved him more than her mother. He glanced at Qin Guan proudly. He is trying to flatter me.</p><br/><p>\"So what's your plan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Listen to me. Let's decide over dinner. We should register at the Civil Affairs Bureau first. If the legal procedure is taken care of, organizing a banquet will be a piece of cake. Cong Nianwei is hesitant about marriage because of her tight schedule. Unless she is done with the Olympic Stadium, she will have no time to consider this. Of course, we won't miss our honeymoon. Let's just take care of the registration first. It's much easier and it won't take much time. I will only feel reassured when I'm holding the certificate in my hands.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's father was really happy to hear this. He burst into laughter proudly. \"Just tell me the truth, young man! Are you worried about my daughter abandoning you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! You are so smart, sir! Although we have a good relationship, the realm of love is always changing. I must have the government's approval.\"</p><br/><p>This was the first time Cong Nianwei's father had seen Qin Guan be this sincere. To his surprise, the handsome, rich man could also be nervous sometimes.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his heart softened before the man's feelings and simple personality.</p><br/><p>My daughter will be happy with him.</p><br/><p>He stood up and patted Qin Guan on the shoulder.</p><br/><p>\"Don't postpone this until after the Spring Festival. We can do it before the holiday.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Okay! Help me convince her, please!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, I'm the master of the family.\"</p><br/><p>\"Great! Thank you so much, sir. I mean\u2026 Thanks, dad!\"</p><br/><p>I still want to hit him with that wrench!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's father returned home regretfully. His wife and daughter were sitting on the couch looking at him. He unconsciously felt guilty.</p><br/><p>Before Cong Nianwei's mother could even question him, the traitor told them everything. The master of the family burst like a bubble in the air.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's mother lost any interest in the matter and walked to the kitchen with the empty trays, leaving Cong Nianwei in the living room. Her daughter was watching TV carefully.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me? Aren't you going to comment?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, dad. What did you expect?\"</p><br/><p>\"You should have at least said something about the registration.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's mother craned her neck around the kitchen door.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan's parents talked to me about it just a few days ago. It's actually none of our business. It's our daughter's decision to make.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's father shot a glance at his daughter eagerly. Cong Nianwei threw a few sunflower seeds back onto her plate.</p><br/><p>\"Is that all?\"</p><br/><p>Her parents nodded in unison.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, but the banquet will have to wait. We can't hold it before the end of 2007.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's okay. We are in no rush about that. The registration will make you a legal couple. If Qin Guan dares treat you badly, I will have an excuse to kill him. Besides, people say that he has become rich now. At least you will take half of his fortune if you get a divorce!\"</p><br/><p>What a clever man!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei didn't even raise her eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\"Most of his capital has been invested into his firm. His shares, real estate and bank accounts are all already in my hands.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" Her father's eyes sparkled. \"May I take a look at them?\"</p><br/><p>\"I can show you the key. They're all in a Swiss bank.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei stood up, putting an end to that boring conversation.</p><br/><p>\"We'll go to the bureau.\" It had been that simple?</p><br/><p>Yes, it had.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei returned to her room and got into bed. The cute big bear from Nanshan Park was by her bedside. The cheap toy was precious to her because of the love behind it.</p><br/><p>In Cong Nianwei's opinion, Qin Guan was just as funny as that bear. That was why they were still in love after so many years. He was Mr. Right for her.</p><br/><p>Why not start a new chapter of my future life with him then? If that certificate will make him happy, then let's do it.</p><br/><p>December 28th 2006 was a sunny day. According to the almanac, it was a good day for a wedding.</p><br/><p>It was not a traditional holiday and it was certainly not Valentine's Day, so there were not that many people at the Civil Affairs Bureau of Y City.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

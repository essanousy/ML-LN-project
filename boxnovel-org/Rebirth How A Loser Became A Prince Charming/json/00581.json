Only when their car disappeared did he realize that he had to clean all the rubbish after the party.</p><br/><p>The country road leading to Vermont was getting narrower and narrower. Wild flowers, cool streams and waterfalls decorated their journey.</p><br/><p>After driving for a long time, they came across a small wooden cabin by the road. Outside it was a simple desk with a board indicating its real estate price and a simple piggy bank.</p><br/><p>There were also agricultural products, including fresh cucumbers, corn and wild honey stolen from poor bears.</p><br/><p>The drivers could take the products and leave money behind. If one didn't have enough change, they could even leave something of theirs in exchange for the goods.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a few cucumbers. He noticed that there were different kinds of payment on the desk.</p><br/><p>Sunglasses, a hair pin, an expensive scarf... Travellers left stuff there just for fun.</p><br/><p>As he was chewing on the cucumbers, Hilton slowed down. They had reached their destination.</p><br/><p>If Qin Guan had covered his eyes on the way there, he would have thought that they had traveled back in time.</p><br/><p>The cabin was quiet. On the wooden fence door was a board that said \"Tudor's Cabin\". The board creaked as the breeze blew it back and forth.</p><br/><p>Hilton pulled the car over. Then the two of them entered through the fence and stepped onto the naturally-growing grass.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a rabbit jumped out of the grass. It shot a curious look at the strange visitors and then disappeared again.</p><br/><p>Blue sky, white clouds, green grass... Anyone would feel relaxed and happy there. An artistic paved path led to the door.</p><br/><p>\"Grandma Tasha, it's Paris!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my dear kitten! Come in, please!\"</p><br/><p>It seemed that Hilton and the famous artist were very close. At her response, Hilton opened the door easily.</p><br/><p>The bell declared the guests' arrival. Qin Guan saw a room with a wooden floor and a Middle-Age fireplace front and center.</p><br/><p>There was a tin heater in the middle of the hall, and an iron chimney that went directly outside the wooden house.</p><br/><p>Firewood was burning in the fireplace, a plain kettle boiling on it.</p><br/><p>Time seemed to have paused one century ago inside the cabin. When he looked at the old lady, Qin Guan thought that they had travelled back in time.</p><br/><p>Tasha Tudor was 79 years old, but her steps were firm and her smile was soft. She was wearing a long dress and a headscarf that made her look like an English milking maid.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome! My kitten brought my guest. I'll send you my catalogue as soon as it's published!\"</p><br/><p>Her voice was as peaceful and elegant as a spring breeze as she introduced another man to Qin Guan and Paris Hilton.</p><br/><p>\"This is Lin, a reporter from Time Magazine. He heard that I asked Qin Guan to be my model and decided to pay me a special visit. You are a popular Asian model here in America after all.\"</p><br/><p>The man didn't look sorry for coming without an invitation. He took a bow, admiring Qin Guan as if he was a piece of art.</p><br/><p>He was so focused on him that he forgot to greet Paris Hilton. Tasha Tudor was familiar with her old friend though.</p><br/><p>\"Just forget about him. He is always like this when he comes across good material. Let's have some tea first. It's scented tea that I produce myself.\"</p><br/><p>Wild chrysanthemums bloomed in the white porcelain cups. The honey and milk on the table had been produced by the woman as well.</p><br/><p>The environment made everyone feel relaxed.</p><br/><p>\"We can start working anytime.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I'll get my tools!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei and Tasha Tudor were both painters, but the difference between them was like the one between the city and the countryside. Anything related to drawing roused both their interests though.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed the door open and saw a big garden outside.</p><br/><p>There were clusters of white wildflowers, twisting vines and blooming morning-glories that grew without any human intervention.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed his shirt into his pants and suddenly saw an old banyan. He rolled his pant legs up and climbed up the tree until he reached a larch branch. He sat down comfortably on it, his long legs hanging down unscrupulously.</p><br/><p>The wind blew over a sweet smell. His white shirt was shaking in the wind as he smiled like a fairy amid the rural scenery.</p><br/><p>Tasha went out with her tools. She sat down on the wooden path and got to work.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

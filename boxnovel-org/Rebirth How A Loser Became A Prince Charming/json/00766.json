That way, they could polish them before publishing the news.</p><br/><p>Wang saw the reporters off before returning to her laptop. She came across a sea of joy on all websites, both domestic and overseas ones. Fans were excited about the good news. Qin Guan, the ever-victorious actor, had won another award.</p><br/><p>They knew that their idol was talented, but most of them had paid attention to him for his looks at the beginning. Now, they understood him and followed him on his journey to the top.</p><br/><p>There were no negative news about him. Everyone talked about his outstanding acting skills, amazing performance and different awards. He never attracted attention by revealing his body, talking about his private affairs or singing his own praises.</p><br/><p>Many people learned about his work after the film was in theaters or won an award. Qin Guan was a clear stream in the entertainment circle, both steady and reliable.</p><br/><p>In other words, he was a very responsible actor.</p><br/><p>As a result, he attracted more and more fans, who were really happy about his news.</p><br/><p>Although news about Qin Guan occupied half the entertainment sections of different magazines and newspapers, his fans remained calm about the spectacular event.</p><br/><p>Pipe was standing under an overpass at Dongzhimen early in the morning. His domain had expanded along with the surging population of the capital and his shabby minibus had been replaced by a new one, but as the best newspaper distributor in half the city, he seldom showed up to work personally.</p><br/><p>It was rare for him to appear under the overpass at such a time. The delivery boys knew that Qin Guan would take up a large part of the page.</p><br/><p>They were right. Wang Xiaoer lit up a cigarette for him.</p><br/><p>\"Listen to me! Your task for today is quite easy. I'm always kind to you all. Old rules apply! Take an extra 200 copies to each stand this morning. Any kind is okay. We just want quantity. You can take 200 copies of the same kind or 10 different kinds. It's up to you!\"</p><br/><p>The flame at the end of his cigarette was as bright as their business. They all knew that the newspapers would be selling like hot cakes thanks to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The competitors looked at each other in alarm. \"What are you waiting for? Time is pressing! Quick!\" At his order, everyone rushed to his minibus.</p><br/><p>\"Let go! It's mine!\"</p><br/><p>\"Son of a b*tch! Can't you count? How many copies did you get? That's too many!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone started fighting with each other fiercely.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoer didn't move. He just smiled at Pipe shamelessly and shot a look at the backseat.</p><br/><p>\"I'm thinner than them, boss. I can't fight with them.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are always cunning. Yours are in the backseat.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Thank you so much! I'll get to work at once!\"</p><br/><p>The lives of the public were a direct feedback of a star's popularity. Everyone was dismissed, leaving only the empty minibus under the overpass. They tried their best to take the newspapers to different corners of the city as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Ordinary people were always the cornerstone of every entertainment star's success. Qin Guan paid his fans back with joy.</p><br/><p>Their idol had made headlines again! He had won a Golden Globe! He was so classy and magnificent!</p><br/><p>On February 18th, everyone in China was talking about the same thing. An actor named Qin Guan had won an internatonal award again! In America!</p><br/><p>To outsiders, this was only a topic of conversation, but for some people with high aspirations, it was a timely event.</p><br/><p>This was a very busy time for the Huayi company. Wang Yu, who was a secretary, was making a schedule for his bosses. When he stood up to knock on the door, a person rushed past him fast.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, do you have an appointment? What are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Before Wang could block the way, the man turned his head back and revealed his face.</p><br/><p>\"It's me! Lu Chuan! I have an appointment with your boss!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

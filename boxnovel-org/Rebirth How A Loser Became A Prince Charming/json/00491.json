Don't tell me that you are following your tutor. You must need my help. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come to me.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wasn't fooled by the cute curly-haired brothers. He had been exposed to their lies before.</p><br/><p>\"Fine, we are in love. We fell in love with two Argentinian sisters. We want to take advantage of summer vacation and follow them to their hometown.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the boys in their pink bubbles. \"So?\"</p><br/><p>\"Our tutor said that if we could persuade you to start work immediately, he would cover their flight tickets home. We really want to follow our sweethearts home, so we accepted the deal.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled, looking at them from head to toe. \"Okay. I\u2019ll join the crew as soon as I finish working on \u2018America's Next Top Model\u2019.\"</p><br/><p>\"When?\"</p><br/><p>\"Tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan arrived at the site of the final competition with a heavy bag.</p><br/><p>The eliminated girls were called again to participate in the show of an American top brand outside the New York Music Hall. The best model of the show would be the winner.</p><br/><p>There were only three girls left after the previous episodes. They were neither rebellious lesbians, nor sincere Catholics. They were well-balanced candidates. They shared the same submissive personality though. They had been naked before the camera and worked with a huge python before. Although they had been horrified, they had tried their best.</p><br/><p>That was the basic criteria for a qualified model and the fundamental element that a brand chose a model by. Without any judges, the KLS fashion company had selected two of them.</p><br/><p>Sana and Eve cried their eyes out together, while Lily went out sadly. Everyone knew that the time for the final battle had come.</p><br/><p>Night fell in New York. The stage looked splendid under the gorgeous lights. As a top model, this was the first time Qin Guan was going to be in the audience. He felt a little strange.</p><br/><p>Qu attracted his attention with a subject he was interested in.</p><br/><p>\"Have you decided about the script yet? When will you join the crew?\"</p><br/><p>\"Tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>Qu looked at her nails. \"Okay. I have talked with the director. That film will not take you long. You can go to Hawaii afterwards. I\u2019ll meet you there.\"</p><br/><p>\"What for?\"</p><br/><p>\"I have made an appointment for an audition for the \u201850 First Dates\u2019 leading part. The director and the producer will go there to look for shooting locations.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried to remember the script. He had been absorbed in \"Lost Embrace\" the previous night and had just read through the others quickly.</p><br/><p>He nodded at her. \"So you won't come to Buenos Aires with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, we have a tight schedule. You\u2019d better wait for Xue Wanyi in New York.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Sister Xue is coming?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, she\u2019s coming for you. She is working hard for your career. She sent the best New Silk Road models for your free subordinate contract with IMG in New York. If an agreement can be reached, you could do anything you like in the American fashion circle at a pretty low price.\"</p><br/><p>Surprised, Qin Guan turned his head around, looking at her eyes behind the glasses. They were misty. \"What did you and Sister Xue do to make the two tycoons show mercy on me?\"</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei lifted her frames.</p><br/><p>\"We made a plan for Asian models to penetrate the American fashion circle. The plan is supported by New Silk Road. They will bring the latest winner of the New Silk Road competition. The female winner will sign a contract with the two tycoons. Beauties will be pouring into their companies in an endless stream. Compared to the limitations of male models, female models can do more. In a few days, Sister Xue will bring the first group to America.\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s a pity that you\u2019ll leave earlier. You could have given them advice...\"</p><br/><p>Her phone rang in her handbag.</p><br/><p>\"Hello? I\u2019m here. Where are you?\"</p><br/><p>Qu pointed to the phone and told Qin Guan, \"What an efficient woman. She\u2019s coming!\" Then she told Sister Xue about the current situation.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was very excited. She jumped up, not caring about her image before the girls.</p><br/><p>\"Wait, I\u2019ll bring the girls to you. Is that okay? Fine!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had won a precious chance for those rookies. It was a great opportunity for them to learn about the traditional modelling circle. They could get first-hand knowledge on the taste and demand of American brands.</p><br/><p>As they drove in a long business car, the excited Chinese girls set their feet on a new stage.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

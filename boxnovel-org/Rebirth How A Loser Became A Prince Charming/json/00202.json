She had participated in her tutor's group for the design plan of a government building, and she had been too busy to inform her boyfriend or call him.</p><br/><p>It had been a happy misunderstanding. They both had a guilty conscience, one for having fun, the other for working.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei kindly waved at Qin Guan's roommates and answered, \"You don't need to pick me up. I have a key anyway. I can drop in during my spare time. I\u2019m glad to see your roommates here. It seems like you won\u2019t be lonely during the holidays.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put her bag on the tea table and asked, \"It's so heavy, what\u2019s in it?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Mu Lejiang got up from the couch and returned to the bedroom with Ye Dong, leaving the living room to the couple.</p><br/><p>\"It's a model I made for you during my spare time in the studio.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei opened the bag. There was a small garden inside it made of countless wooden blocks.</p><br/><p>Her eyes always shined when she talked about architecture. \"It's my dream house. It has a rural style garden and a pointed Gothic roof. Our cars can be parked in the barn beside the garden. I can also have a studio. The pool is not for swimming. It\u2019s at the back door, so it will be an outdoor one.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was getting more and more excited. Meanwhile, an ideological struggle was taking place in Qin Guan's mind.</p><br/><p>How much will I have to pay for this house? Another plan for the future... He unconsciously started calculating his current income on his fingers.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Cong Nianwei felt a cold, greasy liquid flowing by her feet. She looked down and saw her favorite white-striped sandals soaked in a suspicious foaming yellow liquid that was flowing slowly from under the couch.</p><br/><p>She stood up and ran to the bathroom calmly to clean her feet.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Come here!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was concentrated on the money, was paying no attention to her. He only knew that his girlfriend had dashed into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s not good. You can\u2019t take a bath! There are so many people here!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked to the door of the bathroom, rubbing his hands.</p><br/><p>\"Nonsense! Come in!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei turned off the shower and pulled Qin Guan in. Leaving the door unlocked, she asked, \"What's that liquid under the couch? Is that how your roommates think things work at your house? They can just pee on the spot if they fail to reach the bathroom in time?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was disappointed to see she was still wearing her orderly clothes. \"What liquid?\" he asked.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's heart was still fluttering in fear. She pointed to the yellow liquid flowing from underneath the couch.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s beer. We drank some yesterday.\" Qin Guan bent down awkwardly to pick up the empty cans.</p><br/><p>\"Can you explain to me how our house became so messy during the summer?\"</p><br/><p>Six single men living in the same apartment was a terrible thing.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei scanned the room, which she had arranged herself. There were dirty plates piled in the kitchen, two socks of different colors were stuck on the couch, beer was flowing on the living room floor, and stinky clothes were hanging in the closet in the bedroom.</p><br/><p>She cast a fierce glance at Qin Guan, who immediately stepped forward with the most flattering smile. \"I\u2019ll ask them to clean the house,\" he said before pushing open the door of the guest room where Liu was staying.</p><br/><p>Liu was standing by the window with his back to the door. He was holding an empty bottle like an imaginary microphone, singing, \"I was touched by you, a little, a little...\" The lower part of his body was wrapped in a bed sheet.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei pulled out a feather duster from a vase and whipped it against the couch.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shivered at the sound, and so did Liu. \"A little, a little...\" he repeated, sounding like a broken radio.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei pointed at Qin Guan, the living room and the master bedroom with the duster. Before she could speak, Ye Dong and Mu Lejiang, who had been peeping from the crack of the door, walked in with flattering smiles.</p><br/><p>The four boys were listening to the queen giving out orders. \"You, clean the kitchen. Wash the bowls and pans and wipe the table.\"</p><br/><p>\"You, tidy up the bedrooms. Qin Guan, you clean the living room. Move it!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, madam!\"</p><br/><p>They began to work right away, afraid of the whip of love.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei smiled in satisfaction. When the house looked bright and new again, they left the master bedroom to the two lovers.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei leaned on Qin Guan\u2019s chest, fiddling with her wooden house. They sat together silently, Qin Guan caressing her long, soft hair. Suddenly, he took out the Maybelline cosmetics.</p><br/><p>\"Do you like it?\" he asked, setting the present on her legs.</p><br/><p>Slightly surprised, Cong Nianwei put the house aside and opened the box.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could show off, she shouted happily, \"You got me a gift again!\"</p><br/><p>Can she read my mind? How does she know it's a gift?</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei showed him the package. On the bottom, there were several engraved characters reading, \"VOGUE Exclusive\".</p><br/>\n</div>"}

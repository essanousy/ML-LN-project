According to sources in North America and Europe, the media were singing Tokyo's praises. They thought the result was very fair. The youngest winner of the Outstanding Contribution Award inspired everyone to think about the real meaning of cinema itself instead of other irrelevant elements.</p><br/><p>Tokyo was extremely respectful.</p><br/><p>That was what the foreign media thought. They actually loved Qin Guan. If another unfamiliar young actor had won the award, they would have attacked him mercilessly.</p><br/><p>As the reporters kept fighting with each other, Qin Guan was sleeping peacefully at home. He only ever felt safe in that small room. When he got up, he found a pot of porridge in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Thanks to all the awards he had won, Qin Guan's website and microblog had become party venues. His beautiful awards served as decorations. A golden cherry blossom was smiling among silver palm leaves. A large windsurfing board and several shining shells reminded everyone of a beautiful beach. A cute bear was hiding behind a solemn ornamental column... And let's not forget the golden globe and the centaurs!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone realized that Qin Guan had won almost every famous film festival award in existence. There were still a few left though, including an Oscar.</p><br/><p>As his fans began to look forward to that prestigious award, Qin Guan reached his firm slowly, feeling satiated.</p><br/><p>It was time to close the accounts for the end of the year. Before he could finish reading the feedback from the Tokyo Film Festival, his private office phone started ringing. The call had to be about a private issue.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan asked Wang Liying to answer the phone for him.</p><br/><p>\"Hi, this is Lang Kun from CCTV. Is Qin Guan there?\"</p><br/><p>You again! I'm not joining you this year!</p><br/><p>The Spring Festival Gala had not been a good experience for Qin Guan. He hated spending New Year's Eve alone. To him, fame was nothing compared to his family.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan cannot attend the gala this year, director. He spent the whole year working. This is his only chance to see his family. Do you understand?\"</p><br/><p>Understand? I'm the director of the gala! I spend every Spring Festival working. Maybe I'll resign next year!</p><br/><p>Wang's words left Lang speechless. Soon, Wang realized she had misunderstood. Lang had not called Qin Guan about the Spring Festival Gala, but to ask him to make a guest appearance on a friend's project.</p><br/><p>It would be a short appearance at the end of a TV show. He was really brave to ask Qin Guan, who was such a popular actor, to be a guest star. Plus, this was a TV show, not a film!</p><br/><p>It was no ordinary TV show though. It was the hottest primetime show on CCTV. Numerous famous actors had guest starred in it, most of whom were very experienced. The show's audience ratings had beat every other TV program in 2006, with the exception of CCTV News.</p><br/><p>The TV show was called \"My Own Swordsman\".</p><br/><p>The group of obscure actors that starred in it had already become household names. After 80 episodes, the period comedy was finally coming to an end. If they could have a big name guest star in the last episode, the whole series would be completed successfully.</p><br/><p>They would even be able to sell the show overseas. It would be a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>Thus, Director Shang Jing had asked help from Director Lang, who in turn had called Qin Guan. His salary would be low, as the show was a comedy with a limited budget.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded at Wang Liying, who answered in a sweet voice, \"We are sorry for not attending the gala, director. I think Qin Guan won't deny such a simple request. When will the last episode be shot? Okay, at the end of this month. No problem. I'll arrange his schedule. No problem.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Will you come?\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, but I\u2019m busy.\" Qin Guan\u2019s eyes were still fixed on the newspaper.</p><br/><p>\"All of us will be there. Dr. Luke and some famous music producers will also attend. Very famous people will be there!\"</p><br/><p>\"This has nothing to do with me. I\u2019m not a singer. Right, Qu Xuemei?\"</p><br/><p>As all those names reverberated like thunder, Qin Guan didn\u2019t even look up.</p><br/><p>Biting her lips, Hilton finally said, \"I heard that you opened an accounting firm and a C-level gallery in New York.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, so?\" Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei looked up together.</p><br/><p>\"You know, there is always artwork at hotels. If the customers like it, they can buy it through the Hilton hotels.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei nodded. There was such a service at some top hotels.</p><br/><p>\"Besides, our contract with KPMG is about to expire. Our financial manager is planning on choosing some new accounting firms. Everyone likes a good firm.\"</p><br/><p>\"Would you please attend my private party tonight?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure! We\u2019ll come together!\"</p><br/><p>Where is your dignity?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan accepted the invitation immediately, which made Hilton very happy. She had originally thought it would be impossible to please the handsome man. Thank God that he was tender with women.</p><br/><p>The poor girl thought that the man was feeling sorry for her and didn't want to hurt her feelings. She thought that was why he had pretended to accept her invitation.</p><br/><p>She was actually overthinking. Qin Guan was just concentrated on finding clients for his firm.</p><br/><p>There was no time for them to talk any further. The director shouted at them, \"Attention, everyone! Let's shoot the next scene!\"</p><br/><p>Madonna, Britney and Qin Guan entered the set. In the next scene, both women would be in his office at the same time. Qin Guan was sitting on the couch, Madonna lying on his chest tame as a kitten.</p><br/><p>\"Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Britney pushed the old wooden door and saw the man and woman embracing on the couch. Madonna was wearing a mini dancing skirt, while Britney was in a suit short with two thin straps. She looked very sexy.</p><br/><p>She was unhappy with Madonna\u2019s position. Pursing her lips and swaying her bottom, she danced her way to the couch and sat down on Qin Guan\u2019s other side, resting her head on his chest next to Madonna\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Cruel reality was about to teach them a lesson though. Suddenly, Qin Guan opened his eyes. There was no love in them, only indifference.</p><br/><p>The women were smiling happily as he stood up and left, fixing his own shirt. A long shadow was visible on the floor. Britney and Madonna looked weak and helpless in the semi-dark room.</p><br/><p>The poor women had given their hearts to him, only to be abandoned relentlessly. Qin Guan left the room, feeling like an unfaithful lover.</p><br/><p>The rest of the music video had nothing to do with him. He had to deal with a troublemaker now.</p><br/><p>Hilton had made Cong Nianwei angry. The girl was a classic nymphomaniac. Ignoring his official girlfriend, she had tried her best to be around Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no time to talk to them though. He just entered the fitting room. Hilton had been about to follow him, but she was stopped by Qu.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, he is changing clothes!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sorry.\" Her expression was not apologetic though.</p><br/><p>It was July in Los Angeles, so the temperature was very high. Qin Guan had been wearing a suit during his performance, so even his underwear was soaked in sweat.</p><br/><p>When he came out of the fitting room, his style was completely different. His loose shirt, baggy shorts and slippers made Qin Guan look like he\u2019d come from Miami.</p><br/><p>He let out a long breath before he told Hilton, \"You can send the party address to Qu Xuemei. Oh, is there a dress code? Or a formal invitation?\"</p><br/><p>Flattered, Hilton shook her head violently. \"No, no. I\u2019ll make the guest list with my secretary. The guests will be famous people from the music and film industry. It\u2019s not a formal party. You can wear anything you like. Everyone will dress casually.\"</p><br/><p>\"Can I wear these?\" Qin Guan pointed to his slippers.</p><br/><p>\"You could come nude, actually. I\u2019d be okay with it.\" Hilton covered her face. \"I\u2019m terribly sorry!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

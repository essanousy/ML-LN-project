His face was covered in dust, tears and snot. Jennifer was stupefied by his appearance. This was the first time she had ever seen him like this.</p><br/><p>The clever director closed the door for them from outside hurriedly. When some curious people walked over, he explained with a satisfied expression on his face, \"Qin Guan is getting ready for the next scene. He is a very dedicated actor. He never relaxes!\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Brad couldn't even move after Qin Guan's fierce attack. His enemy had calmed down, fixed his soft, smooth wig, dusted off his pants and sat back down.</p><br/><p>\"What do you want then?\" Qin Guan asked. \"Do you want to go to court? My lawyer will send your company a formal letter accusing you of defamation and malicious personal attack. Any wounds on your body will be considered self-defense caused by your provocation.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know that you suffered no bone fractures. Any hospital will tell you the same thing. Unless you want to involve the media in the matter. This is my last film in America. I'm not afraid of anything.\"</p><br/><p>He turned his eyes to Jennifer. He was a stranger after all, so he was worried that they would side against him.</p><br/><p>Jennifer, who was a clever woman, knew what Qin Guan was thinking about. She turned and looked calmly at her husband, who was still on the floor.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing happened here today. My husband slipped and fell by himself as he entered.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. He'd have to fall multiple times to end up in this state. Anyway, this is none of my business.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up and walked past the trembling body on the floor. He pushed the door open and left without looking back. Tim Burton, who was sitting not far from the lounge, grinned when he saw Qin Guan walk out unwounded. He walked over with his hands behind his back.</p><br/><p>\"Are you finished?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing here then, you bastard? Let's get to work! I'll ask Aniston to deal with this matter. You just concentrate on the film.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\"</p><br/><p>\"Go to the set, quick! Attention, please! Next scene: the distressed mill-owner!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got to work at his order. He was a professional actor after all.</p><br/><p>They were already half-way through the film. Four of the five lucky children had been weeded out. The only one left was Charlie, the final winner who would get the chocolate factory. The catch was that Charlie would have to leave his family to live alone at the factory. The boy turned down the fortune.</p><br/><p>His family was the most precious thing for him. This was exactly what Qin Guan lacked. He had parted with his father because of their conflicting opinions, but his father had been waiting for him all this time.</p><br/><p>Kind little Charlie had warmed his frozen heart. Encouraged by the boy, he finally decided to meet his family. He looked nervous in the camera. He was not the calm owner of the world's biggest chocolate factory anymore, but an anxious boy who had been away from his parents for too long.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made the character come alive through his performance. His lips turned red to reflect the change of his mood.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a formal outfit and carrying a golden stick, but he was so nervous that he unconsciously fixed his clothes as he knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>As soon as the door opened, Qin Guan recognized the old man. Time had carved deep wrinkles on his face, but Qin Guan was old enough to read the expression in his father's eyes. It had been 20 years, so the man couldn't recognize him. As he was checking Qin Guan's teeth though, the old man's hands trembled.</p><br/><p>He was a professional dentist, so his hands were always steady. That moment though, they shook before the familiar stranger.</p><br/><p>\"Are you...\"</p><br/><p>His father's hoarse voice expressed his deep love for his child. Qin Guan sat up on the chair tearfully. He was smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>\"It's me!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's you!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm back, Papa!\"</p><br/><p>That was what he'd used to call him as a child. Some things did not change with age.</p><br/><p>Willy Wonka let out his suppressed emotions after 20 years. His father's love was warm and restrained, silent and selfless.</p><br/><p>This was Qin Guan's second film about family and fatherly love. The first film had showed that deep emotion directly, while this film portrayed fatherly love in a funny, almost absurd way.</p><br/><p>The films' directors were different, but the leading actor was the same. Both films drew tears from the audience. The first one made people cry their eyes out, while the second one made them smile tearfully.</p><br/><p>That warm scene was the last one. The cameras were shut off, and the lights were turned off. Everyone returned to reality. The child actors rushed over in tears and hugged Qin Guan. They had become good friends during that short time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

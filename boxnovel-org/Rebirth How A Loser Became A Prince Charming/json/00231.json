My work is boring. You won\u2019t find it interesting.\"</p><br/><p>They smiled modestly. \"We just wanted to have a look.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. \"Okay, there are tables over there. Take a seat. I\u2019m busy now. Can we talk later?\"</p><br/><p>The three guys waved at Qin Guan. Qin Guan led Cong Nianwei to the nearest table and pulled a chair out for her.</p><br/><p>\"You can rest here. I\u2019ll get a cup of water for you. It\u2019s quiet here, so you can just enjoy watching your handsome boyfriend.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei cast him an accusing look. She watched the tall boy run up to the water dispenser happily.</p><br/><p>When Kyoko Fukada came out of the fitting room, she saw Qin Guan sitting with a pretty girl. He was handing her a cup of water. Fingers twisting, they exchanged soft glances with each other.</p><br/><p>\"Yumiko, who is she?\"</p><br/><p>Yumiko told Kyoko the gossip she\u2019d heard.</p><br/><p>\"According to Mr. Qin\u2019s agent, she\u2019s his girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p>Sneering, Kyoko looked at her assistant like a cute, innocent girl. \"Girlfriend? He\u2019s just acting for me!\"</p><br/><p>\"But they seem like such a sweet couple.\"</p><br/><p>\"He only cherishes his fame. He wants me to think he has a girlfriend, because he\u2019s afraid of getting involved with me.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's good. I have better taste anyway. I\u2019m not interested in a man with a girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p>She paused as Qin Guan blew on the hot water again and again before handing it to Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>\"Be careful!\"</p><br/><p>All the onlookers were drawn by his soft expression.</p><br/><p>An assistant nearby fell into deep thought. If Qin Guan was my boyfriend, even for a day, I\u2019d be extremely happy.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the chauvinist male compatriots who always cooperated with her, Kyoko Fukada bit her lips.</p><br/><p>Her assistant continued her report, \"Don't be angry, Fukada. It's just rumored that Mr. Qin\u2019s girlfriend is from a noble family.\"</p><br/><p>Kyoko Fukada pointed at Cong Nianwei with wide eyes and said, \"Impossible! Look at her cheap clothes. She\u2019s no nobility!\"</p><br/><p>Yumiko pulled her behind the set worriedly and looked around. Then she warned Kyoko in a low voice, \"That was really impolite of you. What would you do if the president of Citizen Asia heard that?\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Would they replace a hot star like me?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's possible. Do you know why they chose me as your assistant? Do you know my nickname?\"</p><br/><p>\"Know-It-All?\"</p><br/><p>\"Bingo! According to official gossip, Mr. Zhuchuan discovered Mr. Qin\u2019s real identity. That\u2019s why he was chosen by Citizen.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin is also a nobility. He\u2019s from an ancient family. Does his surname remind you of anything? Qin is quite an ancient family name, just like Shankou and Jingshang in Japan, which can be dated back to ancient times.\"</p><br/><p>She looked at Cong Nianwei. \"The girl must be the one his family chose for him. Some staff saw her come here in a Ferrari.\"</p><br/><p>Kyoko Fukada grimaced. She was not convinced by her assistant. Her admirers in Japan also had luxury cars.</p><br/><p>\"That's not the point. The two cars clearing the way for her were private cars of high-level officials.\"</p><br/><p>Kyoko was frustrated. Okay, I\u2019ll behave. Yumiko just wants to stop me from provoking Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>With the gentlest expression of a Japanese lady, she waved at the photographer, reminding him that she was ready.</p><br/><p>She hated seeing Qin Guan and that girl together though.</p><br/><p>The photographer\u2019s assistant called Qin Guan over. Letting go of Cong Nianwei\u2019s hand, he returned to the set.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had just realized that her three classmates were not as excited as she had imagined. She glanced at them doubtfully, only to find them criticizing Kyoko Fukada with a strange expression.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin made a gesture of holding two balls and told the others disappointedly, \"They are not as big as they looked in the magazine!\"</p><br/><p>What are they talking about? Cong Nianwei was both shocked and happy. Women always liked to be in power. Plus, that girl had tried to provoke her boyfriend.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! I was cheated! I only came here for her big boobs and sexy butt!\" Lan Jin said angrily.</p><br/><p>Guan Jian scratched his head in confusion. \"What are they even doing here? They\u2019re taking photos with so many clothes on!\"</p><br/><p>F*ck! He Ming and Lan Jin suddenly cast a surprised, horrified glance at Quan Jian. They realized his reason for coming was different than theirs.</p><br/><p>Sighing, Guan Jian continued, \"I don't know her, but I think Maria Ozawa and Aoi Sola [1] are much better.\"</p><br/><p>Their theory was confirmed. He Ming asked him, \"What do you think they\u2019ll do next?\"</p><br/><p>Guan Jian grinned. \"Take off their clothes, of course!\"</p><br/><p>The guy had misunderstood Qin Guan\u2019s profession. The other two boys were shocked. Suddenly, Guan Jian laughed. \"Ha! You really believed me? I think she\u2019d do better as an AV actress though!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He hadn't expected that he would be only one of many early birds. When he got there, over half of the seats were already taken.</p><br/><p> Everyone straightened their clothes and sat up properly, as if this was an extraordinary assembly that would determine the fate of the Earth.</p><br/><p> As soon as Qin Guan entered, everyone fixed their eyes on him. The Wang Brothers were absent, so as the third major stockholder of Huayi, Qin Guan was the most important person in the meeting room. Plus, he was also an award-winning actor, a celebrity and a young entrepreneur. Everyone was serious about the meeting.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan took a seat. Some department directors stood up to greet him, as he rarely ever showed up at the company. Although Qin Guan never got involved in everyday work, he had the ability to fire them all.</p><br/><p> It was funny to see a group of middle-aged men line up to shake hands with a young man. Qin Guan had to stand up and talk to them one by one.</p><br/><p> Actually, I'm not interested in the operations of the company. You are all safe. I'm not a mighty CEO who would fire a manager or an assistant...</p><br/><p> Qin Guan kept a gentle smile on his face until the very last minute. The directors thought very highly of him.</p><br/><p> \"It's rare to see such a young and humble stockholder.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, some people pretend to be easy-going, but they are actually really proud behind closed doors...\"</p><br/><p> Actually, they didn't know Qin Guan well. They just judged him based on his looks and what they read in the media. Easy-going? They should have seen him squatting on the ground to eat watermelon in the summer.</p><br/><p> The young men returned to their seats and began to talk, holding their hands in delight.</p><br/><p> \"Ha! I shook hands with QIn Guan!\"</p><br/><p> \"For how long?\"</p><br/><p> \"Five seconds! I counted on my mind!\"</p><br/><p> \"That's nothing. I talked to him!\"</p><br/><p>\"What did you say?\"</p><br/><p>\"I told him I was a loyal fan of his...\"</p><br/><p> \"I won't be washing my hand today...\"</p><br/><p> The meeting was about to begin, when the Wang Brothers arrived. At first, all the departments reported the progress of their work. This was a common start for a shareholders' meeting. When the main part ended, they talked about their investment plan and fund allocation. Everyone took out their weapons. Some managers even rolled up their sleeves.</p><br/><p> When profit and resources were on the line, even friends turned into enemies. As the discussion got more and more heated, Qin Guan scooched closer to Wang, who was sitting nearby.</p><br/><p> \"Shall we take care of the problem with the Ministry of Culture first? You are really vicious. Do you like to watch them fight? You could stop the fight with just one word.\"</p><br/><p> Wang shook his head at Qin Guan. \"This is different from your accounting firm. We can't make a precise plan. There are too many changes in the entertainment circle and too many trends to follow. We'll decide on the basic capital allocation today. That's the only certain source of capital for everyone. It's their livelihood.\"</p><br/><p>\"We have too many people on site, so everyone has to pay attention and be polite. If this was an exclusive meeting, they would have really sprung to action.\"</p><br/><p> You sure sound happy...</p><br/><p> \"You have a point, though. We shouldn't delay everyone.\"</p><br/><p> The Wang Brothers nodded and put an end to the argument.</p><br/><p> \"I think everyone has a general idea of the investment focus of our programs in 2008. Have you read all the scripts? We'll focus on Director Feng Xiaogang's romantic comedy 'If You Are The One'. Are there any comments?\"</p><br/><p> \"I agree!\"</p><br/><p> \"Fine by me!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

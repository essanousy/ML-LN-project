He had been awarded a scholarship for the last time, filled his GRE and TOEFL scores in his application and send it to several universities. There was only a thesis left to write before his graduation.</p><br/><p>He still remembered what his tutor had told him when he\u2019d written his recommendation letter. \"Qin Guan, you must return to China alive.\"</p><br/><p>It was only 9/11. I\u2019m not heading to my execution!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left the tutor's office, having no idea that his tutor had written a long emotional email to his old friend Martin, a tutor at one of the universities Qin Guan had applied to. He will be interested in my beloved student.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the ocean, Martin lit up a cigar contentedly. This is the first time my proud Chinese classmate is begging me for something. I\u2019ll pay attention to that Chinese boy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't know that a serious tutor was waiting for him in the US. He was too focused on the new company.</p><br/><p>At the end of 2001, the construction industry in China had just started to develop, so it was a good chance for making money.</p><br/><p>An important meeting was taking place at a small building in a small city.</p><br/><p>When everyone was present, the greffier blew the steam off the hot tea in front of him and the bidding began.</p><br/><p>As time passed, Zhang Zhenqin got more and more nervous. Will Qin Guan's plan work? Will we win the bid with high prices?</p><br/><p>The arrow was on the bowstring now. There was no turning back. When the host read the name of his company, Zhang pushed the manager sitting beside him, indicating for him to submit the documents.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d originally wanted to submit them himself, but there were so many directors and officials in the meeting room that he was afraid of making a negative impression on them with his behavior.</p><br/><p>The manager carried the documents over with a trolley. Everyone was shocked. That company is bidding for so many projects! They have to be bigger business moguls than the famous Xu and Shan Groups.</p><br/><p>Everyone let out a sigh of relief. You scared us! You are only bidding for small tools after all. Good!</p><br/><p>The directors were satisfied. It's annoying to have bidding applications that make it difficult to do statistical work. That company seems serious about work. Judging from the documents, they attach great importance to the bidding process.</p><br/><p>When the manager got off the podium, Zhang let out a long breath. He took out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat off his bare head.</p><br/><p>Today I\u2019m more nervous than I was when I was being chased by armed enemies. I\u2019ll call Qin Guan later and ask about how to negotiate with these directors.</p><br/><p>Even though it was late at night, Qin Guan was still waiting for Zhang\u2019s call. Zhang called him from the dining party. Qin Guan answered the call in the corridor for fear of disturbing his sleeping roommates.</p><br/><p>\"Hi! How is it going?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang told him proudly, \"Good boy! You clearly know them well! They are all drunk by now!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn\u2019t tell him that he had gotten enough of the drinking culture in that city in his past life. Since he was awake, he asked the most pressing question on his mind, \"Did they make a final decision?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang burst into wild laughter on the other end of the line.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! Spirits stand for friendship! Don't worry, I did as you told me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt relieved as Zhang began to talk nonsense.</p><br/><p>\"Where are you now? Can you return to...\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry! We have a group of assistants here...\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Clang!</p><br/><p>He hung up. Qin Guan smiled. Zhang\u2019s call had added warmth to the cold empty corridor.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sneezed in the cool breeze and returned to his bed.</p><br/><p>It was true that extreme joy begot sorrow. The next day, Qin Guan caught a cold. He lay in bed all day, out of energy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

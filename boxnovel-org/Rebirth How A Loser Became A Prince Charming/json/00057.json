The photographer opened a bottle of water and poured it on Qin Guan's body.</p><br/><p>The wet shirt was immediately pasted on his body. The photographer looked around, feeling like something was missing. He opened another bottle and handed it to Qin Guan, \"Do it yourself. Wet your hair.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan poured the water on his head.</p><br/><p>His hair hung down, several drops of water falling from its tips. His body was partly hidden and partly visible under his shirt.</p><br/><p>The lines of his upper body were clear to the onlookers though. How sexy he looked!</p><br/><p>The assistant beside him felt a warm liquid flowing down her nostrils. She was bleeding!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, everyone was focused on Qin Guan, so no one laughed at her.</p><br/><p>She took a tissue out of her bag and made a roll, pushing it up her nose to stop the bleeding. Then she turned to look at the handsome young man again. I won\u2019t leave the front line on account of some minor injury. I won\u2019t admit defeat!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan held up his wet fringe to expose his forehead. Water drops ran down his face, sweeping over his lips and falling on the floor.</p><br/><p>The photographer captured the moment, taking beautiful photos. Then he asked Qin Guan to touch his body with his hands and take an alluring pose.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had started studying with Professor Li, Qin Guan had made great progress in his poses. He was way better than last time, which could be considered a qualitative leap.</p><br/><p>Before, Qin Guan had depended solely on his face, but now he had gotten good at body language and expressing emotions.</p><br/><p>The series of photos was finished, and Sister Xue handed him a towel to clean himself up. After he changed his clothes, the photographer walked over and said, \"Here are your tickets. You can enjoy some fruit over there.\" Qin Guan took the two tickets. Before he could say thank you though, Sister Xue broke in, \"Sun, I need your help with getting paid.\"</p><br/><p>The photographer was taken aback. \"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue stepped forward and said in low voice, \"You know that Qin Guan has a contract with New Silk Road?\"</p><br/><p>The photographer nodded. \"This is good for his development in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue pretended to look sad. \"We only signed a subordinating contract. All his affairs are in my hand, but all models have to have a portfolio in the company, which the clients look through before they select a model.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan has no photos in his portfolio, so I thought of you.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are a good photographer and you\u2019ve cooperated with him three times. There is a mutual understanding between you, so I\u2019d be assured if you took some photos of him.\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't trust the photographers of New Silk Road. He is not their model, and if they took bad photos of him, his portfolio would be ruined.\"</p><br/><p>The photographer rubbed his jaw. \"You\u2019re right. These photos are a model\u2019s first contact with the clients. They\u2019re the most important factor. Qin Guan is my lucky star. I\u2019ll help him!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was very pleased. She believed that Sun Pengtao was a really good photographer. He didn\u2019t get lots of opportunities though, that\u2019s why he stayed in that small studio and found jobs for himself.</p><br/><p>Given a chance, he might soar up to the sky, so it would be better for Qin Guan to get close to him while he was still a nobody.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was really enthusiastic. \"I need a natural photo, an artistic photo, and a standard ID photo. 1,000 yuan in total. Does that work for you?\"</p><br/><p>Three photos in negative film and self-prepared costumes. This was a really good deal for a photographer who ran a studio.</p><br/><p>Sun Pengtao understood that Sister Xue trusted him and answered yes without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The rest of the photos were taken smoothly. Qin Guan wore the new summer shirt, which was light yellow with a darker shade at the lower hem.</p><br/><p>In his opinion, that designer was a leader in the fashion industry. This style would get really popular after 2005. The changing light yellow color formed splendid flowers on the shirt.</p><br/><p>Following the concept, Qin Guan smiled fervently. Everyone could feel his enthusiasm through the photos.</p><br/><p>The assistant shifted her eyes between Qin Guan and the pictures. Then she took another tissue and pushed a roll into her other nostril.</p><br/><p>They were very busy the following days. Sister Xue and Qin Guan went to see the National Figure Photography Awards Exhibition. The expanded figure photos were hanging on the walls, the artists\u2019 names written under their work.</p><br/><p>Some photos were bright-colored or distinct, and had a gorgeous effect, while others were realistic and moved the audience's heart. Qin Guan's photos were also outstanding. They were clean, simple, and unique. Their leisurely style was just like a breeze.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Sister Xue read the introduction carefully.</p><br/><p>Sun Pengtao is a photographer from the capital. He has engaged in photography for eight years... It was Sun\u2019s biography.</p><br/><p>There was a long comment underneath, which was kind of over the top.</p><br/><p>According to their attitude, I divide photographers into two different groups, the technology-oriented ones and theme-oriented ones.</p><br/><p>The former ones are fascinated by the camera, lenses and technology parameters, which are complicated and mysterious. They think that cameras are lovely pets instead of tools for shooting.</p><br/><p>Those photographers own the best equipment and are in endless pursuit of new models.</p><br/><p>Like a photography encyclopaedia, they\u2019re proud of expanding 35mm plates to no-particle photos of 16x20 inches. They know the advantages of all different kinds of cameras, but they can seldom present us with valuable work. They concentrate on the tools (the equipment) of photography, instead of the purpose (the photos).</p><br/><p>Those interested in the works, or rather the themes of photography, are exactly the opposite.</p><br/><p>Unlike technology-oriented photographers, who focus on equipment and skill, they are attracted to various pictures, such as figures, streets, urban areas, landscapes, nature, modern architecture, the relics of ancient Rome, sports contests, or everyday life.</p><br/><p>They know that they can take a picture in countless different ways, and some images can be processed to become even better. They study the problems of technology. Although some of them are confident with using photography tools, Sun Pengtao both engages in experimenting with technology tools and creates works that capture the audience.</p><br/><p>Many details of his work are immature, but everywhere in his work we can find all the advantages of the second kind of photographers I mentioned above.</p><br/><p>We can see the spirit of the artist in his work. Sun Pengtao is one of the most recommended photographers of this year.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He wouldn't remain unknown to the public.</p><br/><p>The opposite side hadn\u2019t taken Qin Guan's fame and popularity in the domestic modelling and entertainment circle into consideration. He hadn\u2019t gotten close attention from top luxury bands or become as famous as a Hollywood actor yet.</p><br/><p>In their eyes, Qin Guan was no different than a low-level model who had to participate in inferior shows and take eight jobs a day. Qin Guan heaved a long breath. Out of politeness, he was planning on saying goodbye to Qu Xuemei, the chief director of VOGUE.</p><br/><p>The receptionist, who had just been promoted to secretary, stopped Qin Guan outside her office awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\"Prince Qin, she\u2019s busy now. She said she would call you once the sales volume comes out.\"</p><br/><p>The girl winked. She felt sorry for Qin Guan. Our chief editor is too serious. She\u2019s not like other chief editors, who maintain a harmonious relationship with top models.</p><br/><p>\"Here is our gift. Would you please accept it?\" She handed him a paper bag with the VOGUE logo on it.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was surprised, but he smiled happily. \"Thank you.\" He winked back at her and walked out with the bag.</p><br/><p>The girl touched her chest. She felt as if a hammer had hit her on the head. Dizzy, she tried to walk back to her seat. Calm down! Calm down! Oh, my god! My prince looked at me so gently! My heart stopped! Beautiful people can destroy a nation. Ancient people were quite right!</p><br/><p>Behind the shades of her office, Qu Xuemei was staring at Qin Guan, who was talking with her secretary. When he blinked, she took a deep breath unconsciously.</p><br/><p>She tried to come back to her senses and turned around to walk behind her desk. For a long while, she kept staring at the cover of a newly-released magazine. Finally, she touched Qin Guan\u2019s thin sexy lips on the photo. Suddenly, she drew her fingers back, as if she had been pricked.</p><br/><p>She didn't know what to do. She opened a drawer at the bottom of her desk, where there was a full set of Lancome skincare products. It was a gift from Yin Yan. The bitch had wanted to make fun of her. She took out the case, which was covered in dust, and put it in her briefcase.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about his admirers at VOGUE. He opened their gift gladly and saw it was a set of Maybelline cosmetics.</p><br/><p>It was a commodity even cheaper than a stickpin. Besides, what can I do with cosmetics? Oh, I could give them to my girlfriend!</p><br/><p>My girlfriend! I\u2019m terrible! I forgot about her. Those days, Qin Guan and his friends were drinking beer, eating kebabs, and watching TV. He had forgotten about Cong Nianwei, who was also in the capital for her studies.</p><br/><p>Her birthday was drawing near as well. The cosmetics had come just in time. I can deal with this. She will forgive me if I do a couple of things!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grinned to himself in the rearview mirror. I\u2019m so handsome. I will conquer this difficulty! I can change things on her birthday!</p><br/><p>On his way home, Qin Guan didn\u2019t forget to purchase food from the supermarket. The first thing he did when he returned home was put the food in the fridge.</p><br/><p>While he was busy working, he saw Liu Xiaoyang, who had just gotten up. He opened the fridge and took out a bottle of soda, his eyes still foggy from sleep. He opened the bottle with his teeth and said, \"You\u2019re back? You came home early today. Good day at work?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stared at him in surprise. \"You\u2019re a local, yet you don\u2019t sleep at home during the summer holidays. Why do you choose to live in my shabby house and sleep in the same bed with Li Jie?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang replied, \"It's pretty good here. There\u2019s food, drinks, a big bed... Li Jie\u2019s smell bothers me though. I hate cologne.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan kicked him on the butt with his slipper. \"That\u2019s not what I meant. And put some shorts on in my house! Finish your soda and go back to your room!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put the instant frozen dumplings in the freezer. Liu ran to the couch and put a bottle of ice on Mu Lejiang\u2019s face, who was still sleeping.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cker!\" Mu jumped up and shouted at Liu.</p><br/><p>Liu smiled at him and walked his bare butt back to his room.</p><br/><p>\"What are you shouting for? We are tired from doing volunteering work yesterday.\" Ye Dong walked out of the master bedroom, massaging his messy hair.</p><br/><p>When all the guys had gathered in the living room, the lock on the door made a noise.</p><br/><p>\"Who made a key?\" Qin Guan asked them.</p><br/><p>\"Not us! There\u2019s always someone here, so we can just knock on the door. We don\u2019t need a key.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned pale with fear suddenly. \"F*ck! It's my girlfriend! Close the door, Liu Xiaoyang!\"</p><br/><p>Liu looked really frightened. He slammed the door right away.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch! It hurts! My fingers!\" he cried. Qin Guan had no time to do anything but kick the empty cans under the couch. They had drunk beer the previous night.</p><br/><p>The door opened. Cong Nianwei walked up to Qin Guan with a splendid smile and a large backpack.</p><br/><p>Mu Lejiang subconsciously covered his chest with a quilt. The others greeted Cong Nianwei with an awkward smile. \"Hello!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stepped forward politely to take the bag from his girlfriend. \"Why did you drop in so suddenly? You should call me so I can come pick you up.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

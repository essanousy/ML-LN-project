Not long after, Ouyang Fen arranged his clothes, cast a provoking look at Qin Guan, and entered the door confidently with his paperwork.</p><br/><p>Three minutes passed. Four minutes. Ou Qiang was scratching his ears and cheeks in embarrassment on the couch, afraid that his brother would behave like an idiot during the interview. Suddenly, Ouyang Fen walked out with a smile. He walked straight up to the couch Qin Guan was sitting on and sat right next to him.</p><br/><p>Shaking his legs off proudly, he tried to provoke Qin Guan, \"Alas! I wonder why the designer was so satisfied with me. He asked me to walk one more round and wanted to know lots of details about me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Surely, I passed the interview. The main show must depend on the designer's taste.\"</p><br/><p>\"I thought he looked exhausted. He is busy with both design work and the interviews. It must be painstaking work for him.\"</p><br/><p>\"I wanted to suggest that he finishes the interviews as soon as he finds a suitable model for the main show. Otherwise, it'd be a waste of his time.\"</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu, the designer, was indeed quite tired. He had worked overnight twice. That day he had to select the model for the main show, but all his plans had been disrupted by the boss. Originally, Fang Yanyu had planned on hiring Liu Bin, a domestic A level model. The changes in the schedule had ruined that plan though, and Liu Bin had had to quit the show.</p><br/><p>The designer had called several agents, only to find that his favorite models were abroad or couldn\u2019t fit the show into their schedules. He couldn\u2019t do anything but select another model for the main show. Fang had just chosen Ouyang Fen as an alternative.</p><br/><p>The concept of the fall collection was martial arts, and the main colors were blue and silver-grey. It was not as depressing as traditional western costumes, and the outfits had been adjusted to the formal image of the SS Group. Therefore, the type of models the designer wanted to hire would be young, experienced and agile.</p><br/><p>Massaging his bloated forehead, Fang Yanyu gestured for his assistant to call in the next model. After everyone else had been interviewed, it was finally Qin Guan\u2019s turn. (He had no choice, as he had arrived last.)</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu looked up tiredly when Qin Guan walked in. Suddenly, he cheered up like a snowball had been stuck into his collar in the chilling winter. In his experience, the last model had been blessed with a figure every designer dreamed of. He could be considered the perfect clothing model.</p><br/><p>The designer skipped reading Qin Guan's paperwork. Pointing to a place marked with a cross, he ordered, \"Stand at the centre!\" Then he picked up a measuring tape from the table.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan remained silent in the presence of the serious designer and did as he was told. Fang Yanyu measured Qin Guan's height personally, from his bare feet to his head.</p><br/><p>186.65 centimeters. Perfect! Fang wrote it down on his notebook and let out a long breath. Sitting back down on his chair, he said, \"Walk around!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded obediently and walked to the other end of the room. Looking up slightly, he suddenly went into T show mode. Following the rhythm in his mind, he walked up to Fang Yanyu at an appropriate speed. At the standard position of the T stage, he took a pose. Then, putting his hand in an invisible western-style pocket, he turned around handsomely to finish the walk.</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu was so tired that he thought he was hallucinating as Qin Guan passed by him. Qin Guan made a wonderful T show in the small studio, wearing the new SS western clothes. The lower hem of his featured outfit flashed before Fang\u2019s eyes. It was a dreamy scene in his mind.</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu didn't return to reality until Qin Guan bowed before him at the other end of the room. He was only wearing an ordinary hoodie. Pursing his slightly quivering lips in excitement, Fang waved at Qin Guan, who walked over obediently.</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu narrowed his eyes and scanned Qin Guan's waist and shoulders, measuring them with his fingers. Then he took a half-completed outfit from a mould and handed it to Qin Guan. \"Just put it on and make another round.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan carried the clothes on his shoulder with one hand and made another round, starting from the innermost corner of the room. With his straight, long legs, the western-style clothes on his shoulder, and his hands in his pockets, Qin Guan walked to the turning point of the stage and took a standard pose. Then he took the outfit from his shoulder and put it on his arm randomly.</p><br/><p>He looked like an elite businessman who had just gotten off work. Cheering up from the tiredness of the daytime routine, he seemed to be waiting for an unexpected romantic affair in the quiet night.</p><br/><p>Fang patted his legs forcefully in excitement. The pain suppressed the smile on his lips. It's too dangerous. I\u2019m a veteran, yet I nearly got carried away by that green hand. He picked up Qin Guan's file, drew a big circle, and wrote \"main\" on it. Placing it on the thin pile of documents, he exhaled in relief.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan finished his performance, Fang Yanyu told him softly, \"That's all for today. Could you please call my assistant in? I\u2019ll leave the rest to him.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded and did as he was told. Then he returned to his seat.</p><br/><p>By that time, Ouyang Fen had already been sneered at by Sister Xue twice.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan had spent three minutes in the chamber, Sister Xue had found Ouyang Fen, who had been showing off like a peacock, and started taunting him.</p><br/><p>Using her hand as a fan, she\u2019d chatted with Ou Qiang, pretending to blame Qin Guan, \"Alas, there are too many people here, and the air doesn't circulate. My Qin Guan is not a considerate boy. He shows no sympathy for his agent. He has stayed too long in that room. Even if the designer is interested in him, he shouldn\u2019t have been chatting with him for so long.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

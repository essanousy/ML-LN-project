Can I get up? Say something!</p><br/><p> Lochans held his arms up. \"Perfect! Stop!\" His voice broke the silence.</p><br/><p> The girls, who had been hugging each other in tears, finally began talking.</p><br/><p> \"Elves should be kind. They are supposed to love nature and peace. Why? Why did she kill him?\"</p><br/><p> \"Dark creatures are common enemies. Besides, in the elves\u2019 eyes, vampires are unnatural creatures like zombies.\"</p><br/><p> \"The perfume is for Halloween! A little horror is necessary. Our ad is tasteful.\"</p><br/><p> The Batiste brothers greeted Qin Guan warmly.</p><br/><p> Before they began chatting, the director approached Qin Guan. \"Do you know me?\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes...\"</p><br/><p> \"Good! Wait to hear from me.\" Then he turned back to the camera to watch the playback.</p><br/><p> With the help of the assistant, Raquel stood up slowly, lifting her heavy dress. The two French brothers were attracted by the beauty right away.</p><br/><p> \"Hello, Qin Guan. I\u2019m Raquel Zimmermann from Brazil. It was nice to cooperate with you.\"</p><br/><p> The proud woman lowered her head to show her respect for Qin Guan's abilities.</p><br/><p> \"Hi, Raquel. I\u2019m Qin Guan. I\u2019m Chinese. It was my pleasure.\"</p><br/><p> Although his face was pale and cold, Qin Guan was smiling warmly at her.</p><br/><p> Their hands touched and parted. By the time Raquel left, Qin Guan was still smiling. In the following year, she would become his partner at Armani.</p><br/><p> It was good to have a friendly relationship with her.</p><br/><p> The next day, Qin Guan had to go to class. Before that, he had some work with VOGUE and W. The third poster of NY would be made at sunset the next day.</p><br/><p> The NY headquarters were not a luxurious mansion like VOGUE or W\u2019s. It was a single building with a historical vibe, Boston ivy covering most of its surface.</p><br/><p> There was a giant storage room inside, which had been turned into the largest independent studio in New York. It was divided into several different parts.</p><br/><p> That studio would satisfy anyone\u2019s needs.</p><br/><p> Only when Qin Guan entered the studio did he realize the power of girls.</p><br/><p> The girl was called Raynana, and she was the daughter of the NY boss. She was the real boss of the magazine.</p><br/><p> Her father was confident about her, so he had invested a lot in the magazine. If she did everything by the book, the girl would definitely succeed.</p><br/><p> To forge iron, one had to be strong. Only magazines with good content attracted readers.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was tired after class, yet when he saw the wonderful studio, he was cheered up right away.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei had followed him to the studio, because she was anxious about her tired boyfriend. She had just finished her work at the small store.</p><br/><p> Destiny was a magical thing. Cong Nianwei noticed Guo Nuoyan, who was going out of the main building.</p><br/><p> After getting a notice from the boss, the young man had sent Qin Guan's poster and advertisement to the magazine as soon as possible.</p><br/><p> He had tried to get the spot behind Armani, which was also a full page.</p><br/><p> All businessmen were clever.</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei greeted Guo outside the storage room. When she went into the studio with a bottle of water, she was shocked by the dark background Qin Guan would be shooting against.</p><br/><p> Will young girls like a picture like that? It looks like a real adventure.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan turned his face to Cong Nianwei to reveal his strange make-up. Unlike the royal, elegant vampire he had portrayed in the Armani advertisement, he looked like a character from a horror story now. He seemed depressed, gloomy and bloody.</p><br/><p> He was in a black medieval military uniform. The collar of his cloak stood up and covered his cheeks, and his white silk bow tie was hanging over his chest.</p><br/><p> There was a five-pointed star tattoo on his pale hands, that stood for the devil. Silver long hair covered his pale face, just like the first snow of the winter. Red paint was running down his face like bloody tears. Two sharp teeth were poking out beneath his upper lip, making people wary.</p><br/><p> \"Property ready?\" The photographer was itchy to start. The old man was a guest of the fashion magazine. He was just doing this for the high payment.</p><br/><p> \"Ready!\" Holding a glass of Bloody Mary, Raynana walked onto the set carefully.</p><br/><p> The background was an ancient castle. With its dilapidated walls, the Gothic castle looked like the very image of Lord Dracula\u2019s home.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

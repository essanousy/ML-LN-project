He picked one up and pinned it on his hair for fun.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch! F*cking thorns!\" If only he had a high IQ.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was moving on the stage, the music changed to a sad song.</p><br/><p>\"She was an orphan. Her mother died when she was three...\"</p><br/><p>Hey, bro! Stop tricking me! How can I dance to this one?</p><br/><p>In a flash of inspiration, Qin Guan thought of the contemporary dance he had learned recently. He began to roll around on the floor. \"Ouch! So many thorns! It hurts!\"</p><br/><p>He rolled, looked up, straightened his chest, opened his arms, and ran forward. He took a small leap and jumped high before rolling on the floor and doing a perfect split with a grimace.</p><br/><p>He showed the concept of the sad music through contemporary dance.</p><br/><p>His idea was beautiful, but reality was cruel. His performance was pretty good, and some old guests bought flowers.</p><br/><p>His pants were too tight though, and they got torn when he jumped in the air.</p><br/><p>His crotch was open, but the audience wasn\u2019t aware. Only Ouyang Fen had seen.</p><br/><p>Great! You fell right into my trap!</p><br/><p>Ouyang pushed the DJ away and switched the music to a fast disco song.</p><br/><p>Embarrass yourself, Qin Guan. Let all the staff laugh at you! Ouyang Fen was shocked as he stared at Qin Guan's pants proudly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was prouder than him though. I\u2019m not afraid. I\u2019m wearing long shorts! Fast dancing? Fine! I\u2019ll look even hotter!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took off his suit. The buttons fell off with his wild movement.</p><br/><p>His fans were even more excited. New Silk Road was really the No.1 agency in the modelling circle. Qin Guan was so hot!</p><br/><p>The boss was wondering who had arranged this.</p><br/><p>In for a penny, in for a pound. Qin Guan began to unfasten the buttons on his shirt.</p><br/><p>People crowded around the flower baskets. Sister Xue hid away for fear that the ladies would stomp on her.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! He\u2019s taking off his pants!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my! My heart!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, take them off! Take them off!\"</p><br/><p>The performance was reaching its peak, when suddenly Ouyang Fen saw the grim-faced boss. I think I\u2019m in trouble. Qin Guan, you bastard!</p><br/><p>Better late than never. Ouyang Fen switched the music to a rhythmic song for athletes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his dance and got down from the stage, holding his pants up with his hand. It seemed indecent to fasten his pants on the stage.</p><br/><p>The most powerful partner of New Silk Road went up to the boss.</p><br/><p>The boss\u2019 first thought was \"I\u2019m doomed\". That partner was famous in the business circle. If his business hadn\u2019t had something to do with the fashion industry, he wouldn't have paid any attention to models. He had to be angry with Qin Guan's indecent performance though.</p><br/><p>The boss was ready for the worst, but the old man smiled as soon as he saw him.</p><br/><p>\"Is he from your company?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, he\u2019s a green hand. He has gone too far as an affiliated model! I\u2019ll warn him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, no. I think it's okay. He\u2019s a smart boy. I\u2019ll be more confident with models from your company now.\"</p><br/><p>The boss\u2019 expression changed immediately. \"You flatter me. Thank you for your support,\" he answered earnestly.</p><br/><p>\"Can I have his autograph?\"</p><br/><p>The boss was confused. The old man is a star chaser? He realized he wasn\u2019t when his partner pointed at his daughter, a sweet little girl about four or five years old.</p><br/><p>She waved back at her father happily and handed a one-hundred-yuan bill to the flower sellers. \"Ten flowers to the beautiful boy,\" she said in a childish voice.</p><br/><p>Her father shed tears of sadness beside her. He had been replaced in his daughter's heart by Qin Guan. If it were not for my daughter, who would have paid attention to an idiot in torn pants?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was quite satisfied with his performance. He begged a designer to mend his trousers in the backstage area.</p><br/><p>When the New Silk Road boss, his partner, and the little girl went backstage, they found Qin Guan in his colorful shorts.</p><br/><p>\"Daddy, he\u2019s handsome even in shorts! I want his autograph!\" Her father's heart was nearly broken.</p><br/><p>\"I love my daddy best though. He always pays attention to everything. I\u2019ll marry you when I grow up, daddy!\" Her father instantly felt better. I love you too now, young man.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about their complicated conflict. He just signed for the little girl. He had been practising his signature for a long time.</p><br/><p>He got an unexpectedly warm handshake from her father as well.</p><br/><p>\"Nice shorts color,\" the man said.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s pants were mended, but his shirt had been destroyed beyond repair. As a result, he had to fasten the collar around his neck and wear the suit. It looked like a fake collar from the 1960s.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan went back outside, there were other prize-winners making ad-lib performances. Compared to Qin Guan though, who had gotten several flower baskets, they were not as successful.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan helplessly watched Sister Xue take out 1,000 yuan from his money. No tip, huh?</p><br/><p>You even get a share from my performance at the annual gala? I object!</p><br/><p>Overruled!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

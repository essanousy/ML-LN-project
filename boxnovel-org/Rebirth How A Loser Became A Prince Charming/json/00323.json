You guys are too optimistic!</p><br/><p> \"Hey, Joseph...\"</p><br/><p> Joseph\u2019s eyes were shining. He was not influenced by the others. All he could see was the other guy, who was wearing an iron gauze.</p><br/><p> \"Oh, f*ck!\"</p><br/><p> I, Warrior William of 132nd Street, will never yield to anyone! He attacked Joseph again.</p><br/><p> The best defense was offense, so Joseph jumped aside.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was picking his glasses up from the floor, when he looked up and saw another fist in front him.</p><br/><p> He pushed one of his fists down and performed an elegant backward somersault by using the recoiling force. He landed on the table behind him.</p><br/><p> It was a perfect landing. William had just retreated with his arm outstretched.</p><br/><p> Ignorant American guys, huh?</p><br/><p> \"Qin Guan, I love you! Do it again!\" Batiste shouted loudly.</p><br/><p> More and more people saw the fight in the dark. It was even more splendid than the band on the stage.</p><br/><p> It included all the favorite elements of American guys: violence, astonishing results, fairy boys from Asia and mysterious Chinese martial arts.</p><br/><p> Taking advantage of this, Joseph hit the man on the jaw. The attack was on point.</p><br/><p> Blood escaped the man's nose. Looking at his white T-shirt, Joseph jumped back without hesitation.</p><br/><p> So did Qin Guan, who had stopped posing on the table. Thanks to Joseph\u2019s move, he hadn\u2019t attracted more attention.</p><br/><p> As a tall man, Joseph is a bit too vigorous. Judging by his figure, he should have been a tough fighter. He seems to be good at dodging hits though.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan didn't think about it anymore. More and more people gathered around them, curious about the unusual fight.</p><br/><p> \"It's late. We better go,\" Qin Guan suggested.</p><br/><p> \"Fine, let\u2019s go,\" said Joseph.</p><br/><p> He had won the battle, so he didn't want to stay anymore.</p><br/><p> The waiter cleared their cups away. Just before Joseph left, the man lying on the floor rubbed his blood on Joseph\u2019s pants.</p><br/><p> Is that your way of fighting back?</p><br/><p> William had noticed that Joseph was a squeamish guy, because he had cared about his white shirt.</p><br/><p> \"F*ck dich!\" Joseph cried. \"What shall I do now, you motherf*cker?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan stopped him before he could stomp on William's face. \"If you step on his face, you\u2019ll get more blood on your shoes!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan is right. I\u2019d better stay away from the bastard.</p><br/><p> \"Go! Go!\"</p><br/><p> Pushing Joseph, they ran as fast as their feet could carry them. The crowd made a path for them.</p><br/><p> The strong man must have hit his head pretty hard. He was the one who had provoked the others first after all.</p><br/><p> In fact, Joseph was an ordinary man during peaceful times. He liked to provoke others and start fights when he drank though. His friends knew him well.</p><br/><p> When they left the noisy underground club, some hot-blooded youngsters decided that they should learn something from the young martial artist.</p><br/><p> They rushed to the exit, but saw nobody there.</p><br/><p> They all got in the car. Anyone who wasn\u2019t drunk had to drive. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei's driving licenses would be valid in the US in half a year. They had to take the examination again during that time.</p><br/><p> The two cars drove off, leaving smoke behind them.</p><br/><p> The moon looked the same as it did in China. Its dim light was like water.</p><br/><p> The smell of armored concrete in a metropolitan area was exactly the same. After a busy day, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei had a good night\u2019s sleep on a soft bed.</p><br/><p> It was wonderful to experience life in a foreign country. These would be their best memories when they were old.</p><br/><p> New York, New York.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

A few months ago, I was put in charge of an independent program that NBC is counting on a lot.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan understood and asked Wang to open his personal lounge so they could have a private conversation.</p><br/><p>\"Come in. Don't worry, I'm done working for today. No one will bother us here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you!\" Fu Shen relaxed. \"This is about trust for me. I have never embarrassed our college during my career. My superiors think very highly of my abilities. However, I was assigned a difficult task this time.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? What is it? And what's the problem?\"</p><br/><p>\"You must have heard of 'Project Runway'. You are a member of the fashion circle after all. It's an avant-garde talent show for fashion designers that involves designing, tailoring and presenting one's creations on the runway. The audience witnesses the whole process. It's a program that requires high expertise.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know. It's really popular in the fashion circle. It's been airing for three seasons, right? I have heard so many complaints about NBC from my partners and companies. Your program has increased the ambitions of every trainee and assistant and seized them away. They have all left their positions to start their own businesses.\"</p><br/><p>Fu Shen nodded. \"Yes. Our original intention was to help talented designers. As you know, the circle hasn't been very welcoming lately. So many good designers have to work hard for very long in order to succeed, because they lack work experience or an impressive resume. Opportunities are very rare for them. This occupation requires inspiration, not experience. The circle is not friendly towards greenhands and amateurs though.\"</p><br/><p>\"Our program provides them with an open, fair environment. Young designers have been taking advantage of this chance. The show will go on despite the resistance of the fashion circle. That's not the reason I'm here today though.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan handed him a cup of spring tea. \"It's from China. Have a taste.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know brands are not obstructing the show, Fu Shen. A lot of top brands are paying attention to it after all. Even the organizer of the New York Fashion Week is. Anyway, you have created a platform for American designers that aim to work for top brands.\"</p><br/><p>Fu Shen nodded and took a sip of his jasmine tea.</p><br/><p>\"Up until the third season, we had sponsors from all directions, including the New York Fashion Week. I've come here today because the program does not belong to NBC. We bought it from another company.\"</p><br/><p>\"We signed a five-year contract, but the station offered a low price. As a result, when the second season became popular, the producers were somewhat unsatisfied. They believe that NBC has not contributed to the show. They think they should be given credit for its popularity, so they asked for an increase of the original offer. If we don't agree, they will make an offer to another TV station.\"</p><br/><p>To be honest, this story reminded Qin Guan of \"The Ugly Duckling\". The producer wanted to gain more from a show that had unexpectedly turned into a swan. It was unfair, but understandable. All businessmen cared about profit. Everyone was just trying to maximize their personal benefit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

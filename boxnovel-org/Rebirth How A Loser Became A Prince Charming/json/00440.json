They enjoyed some coffee in the sunny afternoon.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan used to think that Chinese people liked to gossip a lot, but during the shooting of \"Sex and the City\", he realized that American women were almost as bad.</p><br/><p>The audience was really interested in the TV series and the romantic interests of the four women.</p><br/><p>The ever-increasing number of reality shows on TV also made Qin Guan realize the power of gossip among girls.</p><br/><p>\"The costumes and props are ready. All the actors can try them on!\" an assistant shouted at the actors who were watching the shooting happily. Okay, let\u2019s go!</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan came out of the dressing room, the whole crew held its breath. The boy enjoying his coffee in his jeans had suddenly changed into another person.</p><br/><p>The haute couture had been rented from a garment shop. For Qin Guan though, who was used to wearing the latest fashion, all the clothes were out of date. Qin Guan was different from other guys. He was like a puppy amid a group of grey ducks.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fixed his dark blue suit and the silk handkerchief in his chest pocket. Then he sat back down at the coffee bar by the street. The drink in his hand was still the same cheap five-dollar coffee, but he was not the man he had been five minutes ago.</p><br/><p>The people shuttling along Wall Street were the busiest in the US. Even a naked woman on the street wouldn\u2019t be able to delay them, yet the elegant young man attracted attention from the ladies.</p><br/><p>Women in Chanel, Burberry and Ports wearing expensive fragrances were emitting endless female hormones as they looked at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"The woman in the pink trench coat with the file in her hand has passed by us three times already. Once for coffee, once to deliver some mail and once for\u2026 I have no idea what!\"</p><br/><p>\"She is okay. Look at those women! The one in grey is making eyes at you. Wow!\"</p><br/><p>There was a strange magnetic field around Qin Guan's seat. People were taking the seats around him one by one. They were all female white-collar workers in high heels.</p><br/><p>That year, pointed high heels were really popular. The longer ones could even be used as screwdrivers. The best method to flirt with a strange man was by nonchalant physical touch. In that situation, only their feet could reach Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>In the quiet evening, a fierce battle was taking place under the table. Several feet in pointed high heels were fighting against each other. It felt like daggers were stabbing Qin Guan's legs.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spit out the coffee in his mouth. A rainbow appeared in the sunlight.</p><br/><p>Qu burst into laughter, and so did the envious onlookers. They were taking pleasure in Qin Guan's misfortune. It was really difficult to turn down a woman\u2019s admiration.</p><br/><p>Everything was ready for the next scene. Essen looked up at the dark sky and shouted at everyone, \"Attention, please! We are shooting the first scene!\"</p><br/><p>The lighting engineer pushed several accent lights over. Qin Guan drove the car slowly towards the building.</p><br/><p>Kim Cattrall entered the set, wearing a sexy low-cut dress. The door of the car opened, and a pair of clean black leather shoes, slender legs and fitting pants appeared. Qin Guan went out. Even the luxury car couldn\u2019t divert the attention from him.</p><br/><p>The camera followed Qin Guan to the entrance of the apartment building. He took the key out of his pocket leisurely. As he was about to enter, Samantha rushed up to him.</p><br/><p>\"Wait a moment! Let me in, please.\"</p><br/><p>The camera turned to her. Her disdainful expression suddenly changed when she saw Qin Guan's face. Her red cheeks, watery eyes and dry lips seemed to be saying, \"I want to flirt with him.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan seemed unaffected. Smiling politely, he introduced himself like a gentleman. \"Kenny, I just moved in.\"</p><br/><p>His voice was really attractive. Samantha felt a big shudder, much like an electric shock. \"Samantha, I live on the third floor,\" she said slowly in a flirting voice, emphasizing each word.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got her meaning. He raised his eyebrows and glanced at the woman, who was inviting him with her body language. \"I live on the fourth. You are right under me.\"</p><br/><p>Samantha got excited at his innuendo and raised her voice. \"It\u2019s my honor to be there. Your car is pretty nice.\"</p><br/><p>Liar! You just sneered at its country style.</p><br/><p>She shot a flirting look at Qin Guan. \"I like a good Hummer. If you know what I mean...\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, goodnight...\"</p><br/><p>Her smile was full of fire. She turned around to go upstairs, the smell of her perfume lingering around Qin Guan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

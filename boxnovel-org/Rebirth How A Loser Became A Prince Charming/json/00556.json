Can I submit an application in time?\"</p><br/><p>\"The girls are ugly and the judges are attractive. This is bullying!\" her mother replied nervously.</p><br/><p>The girl pointed at the screen with sparkling eyes. \"Look! Their performance is much better. Qin Guan was right. Everyone is beautiful, but not everyone can explore and make good use of that potential. I\u2019ll participate in the competition! At least then I\u2019ll know where my beauty lies!\"</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s watch the process before you make a decision. You must know both yourself and your enemies!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, we\u2019ll never miss an episode. Give me some advice, mom!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course I will.\"</p><br/><p>There were a lot of girls who were dreaming of becoming models and many who admired Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Posts started popping up immediately, talking about the Asian boy.</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s so smart!\"</p><br/><p>\"And handsome!\"</p><br/><p>\"Just look at his figure!\"</p><br/><p>His charm had captivated the girls.</p><br/><p>The brilliant competition, with its fashion photoshoots and runway shows, seemed very tempting for the girls, who were eager to become famous.</p><br/><p>This is my dream. I want to be one of them! I\u2019m much better than them!</p><br/><p>The first episode, which lasted about 45 minutes, came to an end soon, leaving the viewers staring at their TVs.</p><br/><p>The program had been fabulous. It had echoed with the ambition and excellent taste of young American women, all the while expressing the dreams in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Thousands of people submitted an online application for the second round of casting for \"America's Next Top Model\". Application forms were flying in from all directions in the United States, carrying the applicants\u2019 hopes. That was the response of the young audience.</p><br/><p> Before the viewers could change the channel though, they were attracted by the advertisement at the end.</p><br/><p>\"This program was sponsored by L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s men\u2019s facial care, a professional skincare set.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's advertisement followed. The audience watched it as they sat back on their couches. His fine face impressed them once again.</p><br/><p>\"How did his parents give birth to such a perfect boy? He is as beautiful as the gods in Greek myths! They must feel so lucky!\"</p><br/><p>Many girls were considering the possibility of buying the skincare set as a gift for their boyfriends. They knew that advertisements were unreliable, but they wanted to try it.</p><br/><p> They were actually misled by Qin Guan\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>As the program ended along with the advertisement, the crew exhaled in relief. The technical director massaged his sore eyes and set his thick glasses down on his desk. He picked up the printed data from the printer as he passed by.</p><br/><p>\"Tina, could you please take the statistics table of the online discussion to the director?\"</p><br/><p>The assistant put a cup of coffee on the desk of the technical director. Then she walked out with the paper.</p><br/><p>In another office, Tyra Banks, the chief executive producer and the advertising executive were waiting for the data. There was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\"Come in, please!\"</p><br/><p>Tina set the piece of paper down on the desk carefully and left silently, closing the door behind her considerately.</p><br/><p>\"It's time for the harvest.\"</p><br/><p>As the executive producer spread the paper slowly, Tyra Banks saw his eyes opening wider and wider. \"William! William, what happened?\"</p><br/><p>William\u2019s eyeballs had reached the edges of their sockets.</p><br/><p>He suddenly came back to his senses. His shaking hands betrayed his excitement.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sorry. We will know the audience ratings tomorrow, but we can have a glimpse of the results through the instant online data. Here it is...\"</p><br/><p>They all looked down together. The number indicating the online visitors during the program was 597,896!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

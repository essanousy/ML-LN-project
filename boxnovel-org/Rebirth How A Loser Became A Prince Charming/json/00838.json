They were all decent guys. Ning Hao would be shameless if he promoted his work this way. The farewell dinner ended silently as everyone drifted away reluctantly in the capital.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was busy with the next steps of production, which included editing, post-production, distribution, etc. His first stop would be the China Film Group Corporation, the company that represented the entire nation. Their subordinate cinemas were his first choice.</p><br/><p>If they reached an agreement, the company's cinemas in Shanghai and Guangzhou would screen the film.</p><br/><p>The negotiation went well. The job depended on the professional managers of his firm, but Qin Guan served as a flag leading an army. Thanks to him, the director of China Film Group would say yes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took advantage of this chance to idle around the company and refresh his memories of the familiar director and staff. There was a good chance that they might remember him as well.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan took advantage of Huayi's resources. The Brothers supported their good partner strongly, but as successful businessmen, they also wanted to maximize the profit of the negotiation.</p><br/><p>The news went viral among the directors, who heard that Qin Guan would show up at Huayi that day. They all turned up with scripts and started fighting in advance.</p><br/><p>As an exclusive director of Huayi, Feng Xiaogang mocked the other well-informed men.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! My great directors! You are all so smart... Is Huayi your company? Such a talented actor is very rare. Do you plan on luring him in with your scripts? Stop daydreaming! He is one of the bosses of Huayi. I have priority here!\"</p><br/><p>The three directors were speechless. Feng Xiaogang even insisted on sitting far away from them, because he was known for \"fighting for the dignity of commercial directors\". Jiang Wen, who was the youngest of the three, spoke up first.</p><br/><p>\"I don't agree with you, Director Feng. Chinese people should be united. I am on friendly terms with Qin Guan and Huayi. Although I'm an independent director, I didn't come here today for the money. I know I'm not welcome at Huayi, but we shouldn't be waiting here!\"</p><br/><p>Feng got even angrier. I'm an exclusive director of Huayi, but I still have to wait here with you guys.</p><br/><p>The Wang Brothers became nervous when the four men appeared together in their office. They hid in another office and asked their secretary to lead them to a meeting room. The news about Qin Guan had spread really fast, which meant that the company could be filled with spies.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there were no secrets in the entertainment circle. Plus, one of the four directors had cooperated with Qin Guan before.</p><br/><p>It was Zhang Yimou. The previous year, the domestic box office had experienced a big success. The leaders couldn't help but pick up their weapons again and try to challenge big-budget commercial films. They foresaw a bright future for their films.</p><br/><p>That was why they had gone there with their best scripts. They were itching for another round. The biggest entertainment company had become their first choice for getting money and good actors.</p><br/><p>It was not a coincidence that the four of them had gotten together. It was rare for a domestic actor to be so popular and rich. Qin Guan was though.</p><br/><p>As the four prestigious directors were enjoying some free tea in the meeting room, Qin Guan reached the Wang Brothers' office through a secret elevator.</p><br/><p>The Brothers rubbed their hands awkwardly as they explained the situation in the meeting room. They had expected Qin Guan to be annoyed, but he was actually itching to try.</p><br/><p>What an exciting moment! Four famous directors are fighting over me! This is wonderful!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to watch the world burn, so he said goodbye to the Brothers and headed to the meeting room.</p><br/><p>The directors' staring contest had reached its peak. As soon as Qin Guan pushed the door open, a spring breeze and a light rain entered the room.</p><br/><p>The sum of the ages of the four directors was almost 200, so Qin Guan greeted them politely from the door.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Only the enterprises that could truly do this could achieve sustainable development.</p><br/><p>Of course, Qin Guan's focus that day was not on QC, but on his art studio. His staff were currently waiting for him.</p><br/><p>There were two decisions for him to make. The first one was about the news of his upcoming awards and his cooperation with American film companies.</p><br/><p>The second one was about his harvest in Frankfurt and the samples of new fabrics from other countries that Wang had purchased.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan entered the meeting room, everyone turned to look at him seriously. The most excited person in the room was Rongzhi, who had been his fellow schoolmate back at Columbia.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt awkward as he watched him wave at him happily. He wondered how Sister Xue had managed to convince such a talented young man to work for his firm. This was a good example of wasting one's talent on a worthless job.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had forgotten that money couldn't buy everything. Tech geeks did not care about making a fortune. They just wanted to work on computers.</p><br/><p>Plus, even though Rongzhi's talent was too big for his firm, Qin Guan could still afford to pay him.</p><br/><p>Rongzhi really liked the job. Although his tutor had begged him on his knees and tried to convince him otherwise, he had still left without looking back.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly came back to reality. He wasn't worried about the first decision. It might have seemed complicated, but each process had certain steps one had to follow. When one cooperated with professional PR agencies, everything was done on schedule.</p><br/><p>His second job for the day was way more hardcore. The eccentric designers had started to fight over the colorful samples in Wang's hands. The spring collection of Yin Changtao's independent brand had not been decided yet, because they hadn't reached an agreement on the high-tech fabrics they would use. </p><br/><p>Qin Guan's brand was targeted at white-collar workers, which was a quite different target group than the one J Clothing was aimed at, so they unfortunately couldn't study its pattern. As newcomers in the market, there were only two ways for them to get a share of the market: by using innovative designs or multi-functional fabrics.</p><br/><p>The high-end samples from Frankfurt were way too expensive for them. The new brand couldn't even afford the fabric shipping costs.</p><br/><p>Memory fabric was the best choice for busy office workers, as it did not require ironing and one could just knead it throughout the day and then restore it to its original shape at night by putting it on a hanger.</p><br/><p>This method could be applied to jackets, wind coats and suits, which were the favorite everyday clothes of office workers.</p><br/><p>There was also a Japanese fabric that could turn sunshine into thermal energy. This made it the best choice for spring clothing lining, but it was unfortunately very expensive and little in quantity. High-tech fabrics were sold at high prices. They were not made in China, so they couldn't meet the demands of a large factory.</p><br/><p>One particular sentence of Wang's speech attracted Sister Xue and Qin Guan's attention.</p><br/><p>\"I purchased samples based on your requirements. I'm not like Guo from J Clothing, who bought leftover materials from 3,000 stands and sent them back to China. The shipping alone must have cost him a fortune. Who knows, maybe J Clothing can recycle its spare fabrics...\"</p><br/><p>The talented designers grinned at her joke, feeling at ease once again. Only Sister Xue and Qin Guan understood what she meant. They knew the boss of J Clothing all too well after all.</p><br/><p>He was a cunning businessman who had started from telemarketing and made deliberate, purposeful moves. This could be the key to reducing the fabric cost.</p><br/><p>When the meeting was over, Qin Guan and Sister Xue exchanged a meaningful glance. Rongzhi promised to take care of it. In 10 minutes, he had gotten them what they wanted.</p><br/><p>The boss of J Clothing had invested in two production lines at the top of the modern textile industry. He had also hired a big group of technical research and development specialists.</p><br/><p>The group included talented individuals that specialized in fabric production, printing, dyeing and chemical and light industry. The name of the group leader sounded familiar to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>It was a Chinese woman called Hu Li, who had graduated from the Manchester Institute of Technology with a Doctorate's Degree. That particular college was famous for its fashion textile development.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Is a foreign country more attractive than his home?</p><br/><p>Even Ouyang was shocked by the news. He didn\u2019t agree with Qin Guan's choice.</p><br/><p>\"I have talked with my agent. I won\u2019t be here, but I don\u2019t want all those resources to be wasted. She will cooperate with New Silk Road to develop the domestic market. It\u2019s for our mutual benefit. Maybe by the time I return to China, one of you will be a top model.\"</p><br/><p>Ouyang wanted to sneer at Qin Guan, but he remained silent for once. The stage was not large enough for everyone. One off, one up.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the harmonious atmosphere among the four guys changed. Who would be the lucky one to get Sister Xue's guidance? Ouyang Fen? Or the younger models?</p><br/><p>People always obsessed over such benefits. Ouyang cared about other things though. \"You\u2019re leaving the circle?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt warm at the question. \"I\u2019ll work abroad. I think the domestic shows are not interesting enough. I want to bully those foreigners.\"</p><br/><p>Ouyang made a face at him. \"You? Do you know what kind of faces they like?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled happily. He looked like a flower blooming in fairyland. Dazzled by his smile, the waitress run into a pillar.</p><br/><p>Bang! Her tray and cups fell on the floor.</p><br/><p>All the guests in the lounge were attracted by the handsome boy. Nobody paid attention to the waitress.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised his eyebrows at Ouyang. \"See? Real beauty knows no borders. That's the difference between you and me.\"</p><br/><p>I can't talk with him. Ouyang stood up. I better get some sleep.</p><br/><p>His agent, Ou Qiang, didn't follow him. He smiled at Qin Guan awkwardly. \"Er... Where is...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed outside. \"She\u2019s over there.\"</p><br/><p>When I leave, I hope he can take care of you. This is all I can do for you.</p><br/><p>If Sister Xue could read his thoughts, she would have had a talk with him about his life and ideals. While everyone was busy with work, Qin Guan fell asleep under his quilt.</p><br/><p>To compensate for the waitress\u2019 behavior, the hotel gave the galaxy miniature to Qin Guan as a gift. Qin Guan took the artwork for free, even though it was on sale. His first day in Japan was turning out to be quite lucky.</p><br/><p>I hope everything will go well tomorrow. Besides, I have to buy some local souvenirs for Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>The next morning, the whole team got up early. The stylists pulled Qin Guan directly to the dressing room. They applied layers of makeup to his face. In a country where everyone wore make-up, a face without makeup was considered impolite. During that long process, Qin Guan nearly fell asleep again.</p><br/><p>He changed into his formal outfit and walked out. In the corridor, everyone was ready to go. The four models were full of joy.</p><br/><p>The five young men were wearing the same black western-style clothes and white shirts, which had been provided by the sponsor of the party, Issey Miyake. The difference lay in the details.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked extraordinary among them, just like a celebrity and his bodyguards. The outstanding models were like nobodies next to him.</p><br/><p>Everyone fixed their eyes on Qin Guan. The manager looked at his watch and asked everybody to meet in the lobby. They headed to the meeting place together.</p><br/><p>After getting out of their cars, they were divided into two groups for different channels. Flashlights were twinkling around Qin Guan and the other four models. The moment he entered the hall, all the media saw the lucky boy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew what to do. He walked up to the big board and signed his name on it. Ouyang Fen and the others were standing behind him in two rows.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put down the pen and turned around. The smart reporters stretched their microphones out towards his mouth.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin, what's your opinion on the other contestant?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin, you and the runner-up come from the same country. Would you like to say something to him?\"</p><br/><p> \"Mr. Qin...\"</p><br/><p> \"Mr. Qin...\"</p><br/><p>Reporters from different countries clustered around Qin Guan for a first-hand comment.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan answered their questions unhurriedly in different languages, which surprised everyone in the hall. No model was that skilled in languages. He could speak Chinese, Japanese, Korean and English. He even greeted a reporter from a mini state!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

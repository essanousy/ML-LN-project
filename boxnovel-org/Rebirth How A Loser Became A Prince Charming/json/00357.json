Susanna and Cong Nianwei followed them, chatting and laughing. They would change clothes in John\u2019s dormitory.</p><br/><p>To be honest, dormitories at Columbia had impressed Qin Guan with their dirty, disorderly state. They were way worse than Qin Guan\u2019s previous dormitory.</p><br/><p>However, since he had told John that he would be visiting several days ago, John should have had enough time to clean his room.</p><br/><p>Reality blew him away though. When the door opened, a stinky smell surged out. Only the smell of fermented bean curd and durian could be compared to that stench.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gestured at Cong Nianwei and slowly stepped into the room.</p><br/><p>It was a small room of about eight square meters. Garbage was piled on the two beds, leaving no space for the guests. Plastic bags, waste paper and red underwear were lying miserably on the floor.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan coughed. \"It\u2019s a little messy.\"</p><br/><p>A little? That was a euphemism.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put his hands on a table and realized he had gotten ketchup and cheese on his palm. He calmly lifted the papers, only to find several pizza boxes under them. They were leftovers from several days ago.</p><br/><p>\"You know how much homework we have, Qin Guan. I have no time to eat out, so I order in... Come in, Cong Nianwei.\"</p><br/><p>\"My roommate is a hard-working boy. He must be at the library right now. Welcome!\"</p><br/><p>He wrapped all the garbage up in his quilt and threw it on the other bed, so his guests could sit on his bed.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\"</p><br/><p>A hairy head rose from beneath the quilt on the other bed. The scared boy looked ready to bolt.</p><br/><p>\"Rongzhi? Did you skip class?\"</p><br/><p>\"John? What time is it? What hit me just now?\"</p><br/><p>The two of them were looking at each other with an incredulous expression, when a dumbbell fell from Rongzhi\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Everyone burst into laughter. Rongzhi came back to his senses and picked up his glasses from the pile of garbage.</p><br/><p>\"Friends of yours?\" he asked before suddenly falling silent.</p><br/><p>What do I see? Is that an angel? A beautiful goddess from Ancient Greece? A fairy from Wonderland? Fairies don\u2019t have black hair and eyes though!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by the expression in the boy\u2019s eyes. He turned around and saw Cong Nianwei standing behind him in a white dress, looking slim and graceful.</p><br/><p>You are really brave, boy! You dare express your admiration before her boyfriend! You are offending me!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked up to Cong Nianwei, intending to lead her outside. Then he would close the door and have a private talk with Rongzhi about his life and ideals.</p><br/><p>Rongzhi hugged him from behind though.</p><br/><p>\"My Mona Lisa! Even the mysterious Nile couldn't carry my longing for you...\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\" Everyone in the room was frightened. Rongzhi seemed like an ordinary boy, yet he was not admiring a beautiful girl like Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, dude. Are you still dreaming? I\u2019m a guy!\"</p><br/><p>In ancient Roman and Greek mythology, gods were all non-sexual. Nothing could suppress their beauty, not even age or gender.</p><br/><p>You are Venus, the most dazzling star in the sky. You are my heart...</p><br/><p>Rongzhi was just a pure admirer of beautiful things. Qin Guan wanted to give him a lesson, but hesitated. People always enjoyed getting worshipped by others.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had originally thought he was just another pursuer, but he had turned out to be a love rival. And he was a boy! She suddenly walked up to Rongzhi.</p><br/><p>\"Let him go!\"</p><br/><p>\"Never! Why? Who are you?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m his girlfriend.\" Cong Nianwei put both hands on her waist. Anyone who knew her would know that she was outraged.</p><br/><p>Rongzhi cleaned his glasses with one hand and sized her up from head to toe. \"Ugly woman!\"</p><br/><p>Wow! He was doomed. Mou Xiaoliu had infinite strength and Huang Jiajia was good at unreasonable demands, but Cong Nianwei was not like them. She was a smart girl who could kill a person without even getting blood on her hands.</p><br/><p>\"Rongzhi, as far as I know, your team will be participating in a national design contest at the end of the year. I\u2019m not usually interested in unofficial, unprofessional contests, but Ryan asked me to join his team yesterday and I don\u2019t want to say no to him. I have decided to join his team...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

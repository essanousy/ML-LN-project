He only cared that he was a rich man with good relations with international fashion brands.</p><br/><p>If he is a fan of Liu Xiang, maybe he could invest in our team in the future. Could I convince him to invest in some unpopular sports? I should have a word with him when the race is over!</p><br/><p>Although the two men came from two completely different worlds, they had a good talk with each other. Everyone decided to contact Qin Guan to create a more striking publicity effect, promote the sports event and maximize the profits for the Chinese General Sports Administration.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that he had been exposed to determined people with high aspirations. He and Xu were sitting in their seats silently, waiting for the big moment.</p><br/><p>They were both patriots, so they would always support Liu Xiang regardless of the final result. However, when they realized that he was the only Asian among Africans, they felt horrible.</p><br/><p>\"Do you remember our ethnology course back at Columbia? What is a common characteristic of black people? Their natural physique is the most suitable for races!\"</p><br/><p>\"It probably is...\" They exchanged an awkward smile. Suddenly, the race started.</p><br/><p>Bang! The eight athletes on the starting line rushed out like arrows.</p><br/><p>\"Lausanne is Liu Xiang's lucky place. He has broken international youth records here. Now he is in the city again!\"</p><br/><p>\"His start was not that good. He is only fifth among the eight athletes.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's been three hurdles already, but he is still lagging behind. The athlete on the third track is in the lead.\"</p><br/><p>\"Fifth hurdle! He suddenly started speeding up! Wow! Sprinters rarely start speeding up half-way through the race.\"</p><br/><p>\"His steps and rhythm are perfect, he's not affected by the others.\"</p><br/><p>\"Great! He jumped over the final hurdle and he's approaching the finish line first! We finally have a winner!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Xu Xiaoxiao bounced up excitedly the moment Liu's chest touched the tape. They could only express their excitement by screaming and waving their flag around fiercely. Only someone who was there could experience the passion of Chinese fans. They had forgotten about everything. They just wanted to express their emotions.</p><br/><p>Before going to talk to the reporters, Liu Xiang sat down next to the timer with his international record. The young man loved to show off. International media loved guys like him. The reporters gathered around Liu Xiang, who was waving his arms and laughing in abandon.</p><br/><p>As he looked at the crowd, Xu felt a sudden desire to laugh.</p><br/><p>\"Is this the first time you act like a fan instead of an idol?\" he asked Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"He looks so happy right now. He must not understand the meaning of his achievement. His life will be full of flower bouquets and applause in the future. His every movement will be under the spotlight. Plus, he will also have to keep training hard. The hopes of the entire population will be resting on his shoulders. Is the boy prepared for that?\"</p><br/><p>Was he prepared for that? Qin Guan didn't want to discuss the topic any further. He and Xu left as fast as they could in an effort to avoid more attention. Before they could get out of the stadium though, people started chasing them from all directions.</p><br/><p>They were sports fans from all over the world who had seen their idol on the large screen. They had been looking at Qin Guan through their binoculars and cameras, so they acted as soon as he left his seat.</p><br/><p>More and more fans gathered around him with marker pens and white T-shirts for him to sign. This attracted the attention of the other audience members. Humans tended to follow the current, so everyone else also started taking out pens.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan forced his way to the exit, regretting not taking Han Zhujiu with him. When he reached the exit, a pair of large hands pulled him through a side door used by athletes.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Qin Guan!\" Xu followed him in quickly. The security guards shut the fans out.</p><br/><p>We are safe! Before Qin Guan could express his gratitude, he realized that his savior was a kind middle-aged Chinese man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

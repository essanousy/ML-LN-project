Suddenly, he felt inspired. A grin formed slowly on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Last time, he left as soon as he could after the shooting. The three Chinese businessmen were not happy. They had spent a lot on the film after all. Is he also a businessman? Maybe we could give them a chance to take a group photo with Qin Guan in America. Ask them if they want to go.\"</p><br/><p>Cunning minds always came up with dirty tricks. Villains were just ordinary people after all.</p><br/><p>Far away in America, Qin Guan had no idea what was going on in China. Some conscientious people were observing him from afar, as his success had attracted the attention of a powerful film department.</p><br/><p>He's won international awards that had so far been beyond our reach. Now he has returned to China. This is the right time to talk about the future.</p><br/><p>Director Zheng of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) was quite angry that day, as he was suffering from rhinitis. He had asked for leave in order to see a doctor before he returned to the office for a meeting. As a civil servant, he had a very high self-awareness.</p><br/><p>However, the location of the outpatient department ended up ruining his plan.</p><br/><p>There were too many buildings and narrow alleys by the West Second Ring, and the people crowding around the streets and alleys caused a traffic jam. Director Zheng sat in his car nervously. This would be his first internal meeting after his promotion. It would be a disaster if he was late.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he made a decision. He returned to the hospital and pulled over in the small parking lot. Then he put on his coat, as he was planning on returning on foot. It would only take him 15 minutes to get to his office. He was an active man after all.</p><br/><p>Despite the big crowd, he found it easier to walk on the sidewalk. He was actually really satisfied with his speed.</p><br/><p>All good things came to an end though. The crowd slowed down half-way as people started gathering around a newsstand. Zheng was surprised to see that there was a really long line.</p><br/><p>He craned his neck to look at the stand and saw people huddling together in an area of barely two square meters.</p><br/><p>\"I'm taking a copy of 'Beijing News'! Here's the money!\"</p><br/><p>\"One morning paper! Here's the money!\"</p><br/><p>\"I want one too. No, no! I want the 'Beijing Consumption Guide' in color!\"</p><br/><p>\"In color? Where is it? I want three copies of it!\"</p><br/><p>What are they all doing here? They seem so interested in entertainment news!</p><br/><p>Zheng, who was always highly aware of other people's needs, squeezed into the crowd and stretched his hand out, reaching for the popular colorful newspaper.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me! One yuan!\"</p><br/><p>Before his voice could fade away, a hand in a red leather glove grabbed the paper.</p><br/><p>\"Hey!\" Zheng shot a threatening look at the owner of the hand before choking on his next words.</p><br/><p>Before him stood a beautiful girl with thin eyebrows, bright eyes and fair skin that seemed to light the dull winter day up.</p><br/><p>\"Hey?\" Huang Jiajia pulled the newspaper out of his hand and threw a coin into the box. Then she turned to console the strong fat man.</p><br/><p>\"I'm doing this for you. You shouldn't buy it today. It's not for you. You'll lose your confidence if you read it.\"</p><br/><p>The girl smiled brightly at Zheng. Before he could come back to his senses, the beautiful girl had dusted off the last copy, stuffed it into her bag and left without looking back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

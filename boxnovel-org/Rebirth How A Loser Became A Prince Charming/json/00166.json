He scratched his head helplessly and caught sight of Mou Xiaoliu, who was standing by the grove.</p><br/><p>Seeing her as his savior, he walked up to her happily.</p><br/><p>Mou\u2019s face was also covered in tears though. She wasn\u2019t crying loudly like Huang Jiajia. She was just sobbing silently.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan lost his head. What was going on? Why were girls crying everywhere? Having no idea where to place his hands, he put them in the pockets of his pants and asked Mou in his most gentle voice, \"Could you take care of Huang Jiajia for me? I have to go.\"</p><br/><p>Mou fixed her eyes on the handsome boy and then closed them to prevent tears from sliding out. She nodded slightly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan breathed out, as if he had been relieved of a heavy load. He ran away as quickly as possible, as if a dog was chasing after him. F*ck! If I stay here, I\u2019ll be drowned in women\u2019s tears. Why is Mou crying too? It's very strange.</p><br/><p>Mou and Huang Jiajia sat facing each other silently.</p><br/><p>\"Will you give up?\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia wiped her tears from her face with her arm. \"Never! He will regret it one day!\" Her tone was half-angry, half-affectionate.</p><br/><p>The setting sun cast its last wisp of sunlight on the girls, who were comforting each other. The night fell, but their own sun would rise soon.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned over in his bed at night. He wanted to call Cong Nianwei, but he didn\u2019t. He had no outlet for his emotions.</p><br/><p>Who could I talk to about this matter? To my girlfriend? She would blame me for flirting with other girls. To my roommates? They would think I\u2019m showing off. To my best friends from high school? Those two dare not even speak to girls! I\u2019m too handsome to have friends!</p><br/><p>Handsome guys still needed food though, so Qin Guan was planning on spending all his spare time on establishing his career. He was about to get down to business.</p><br/><p>He did not want to work as a promotion specialist or a vendor, as one might have imagined. Considering his professional certificates, Qin Guan wanted to get a formal job. Even a part-time, unpaid position would do.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, reality was cruel. In 2000, job hunting websites such as 61job and China Talents had just been launched and did not have adequate resources.</p><br/><p>They did not offer many full-time jobs, let alone part-time jobs. Besides, Qin Guan had to pick out the scammers from the heavy, complicated database.</p><br/><p>After two days of endless interviews, Qin Guan discovered that four out of five companies recruiting part-time employers were not reliable. They either asked for a guarantee deposit or an agency fee.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qin Guan gave up on the websites. His four older friends\u2019 companies were not looking for part-time employees either. Plus, Qin Guan didn't have a diploma yet.</p><br/><p>His only choice was to beg an acquaintance. As an adult with two lives under his belt, Qin Guan preferred to rely on himself. That autumn, he put on his white shirt, black suit pants and cross-body bag and welcomed the new interviewing season.</p><br/><p>The Lama Temple Talent Market and the Job Fair at the National Exhibition Center were very crowded. There were helpless people everywhere. Among the lines of cabinets, the ones sitting behind the tables would be the first one would have to pass on their way to a career.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan squeezed in and out of the crowd, only to find that no company was in need of part-time employees. Without a diploma, Qin Guan could only get a cleaning or public security job.</p><br/><p>Actually, he did not even qualify for public security, as that required a diploma from a technical school. There were also additional terms, and relative experience and former soldiers were preferred.</p><br/><p>Was there no job for him at the talent market? Who said that skill prevailed? Without a diploma as a stepping stone to success, how could he get through the door?</p><br/><p>His only choice was to clean buildings.</p><br/><p>Just as the description implied, the job was a joke among promotion specialists.</p><br/><p>Promotion specialists would try their best to get into an office building despite the strict guards at the entrance. They just wouldn't give up. They would leave no stone unturned until they met the director of every company. They had to at least meet with a manager to promote their products.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to do that to promote himself.</p><br/><p>The strict entrance guard was nothing for him.</p><br/><p>The Motorola Building at the International Trade Centre welcomed the most handsome visitors. Before the security staff could ask him to register, Qin Guan pointed at the reception. \"I\u2019m waiting for my sister.\"</p><br/><p>The guard gestured, inviting him in.</p><br/><p>The second passpoint was the reception hall.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked up to the reception leisurely. The girls behind it were looking at him admiringly. One of them recognized him, recalling the latest issue of ELLE magazine.</p><br/><p>She stood up excitedly as Qin Guan spoke naturally.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, ladies, let me check...\" Qin Guan glanced at the chart behind them quickly. \"Which elevator should I take to reach the Technical Department on the sixth floor?\"</p><br/><p>The two girls were dazzled by his smile. They pointed to an elevator on the left.</p><br/><p>\"That one.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan passed safely again.</p><br/><p>By the time he entered the elevator, the two girls realized they should have asked for an autograph or a photo. \"I could show off to my friends at dinner!\"</p><br/><p>\"Me too! I could post the photos on the Goupu Forum and show off to the women on the Haijiao Forum. They pretend to be sophisticated, but it's me who got a real life photo of my idol!\"</p><br/><p>\"No wonder he\u2019s so highly appraised on Haijiao. It\u2019s the first time I see someone look more beautiful in real life than in pictures. Those inferior photos people upload are an insult to his beauty.\"</p><br/><p>\"What's his real name though? I only know that he played Zhang Changzhong.\"</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t know either. I have only seen his magazines and advertisements.\"</p><br/><p>That was awkward!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

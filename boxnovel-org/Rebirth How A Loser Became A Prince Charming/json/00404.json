The final scene and a second beauty, which was not inferior to Julia by any means, were waiting for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Drew Barrymore looked at Qin Guan with a mocking expression. The power of the tabloids had taken effect already.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was grateful that Cong Nianwei never read entertainment newspapers. Otherwise, his acting career would come to an end.</p><br/><p> The last scene was shot on a sunny day at a small town with a wonderful view. It was Qin Guan and Drew Barrymore\u2019s wedding ceremony, which would mark the end of his dark past and the beginning of his new life.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Drew Barrymore walked out of the church slowly, hand in hand. They were wearing a pure white wedding dress and a formal suit.</p><br/><p> White doves flew in the sky above them as the church bells chimed.</p><br/><p> Meanwhile, in the graveyard beside the church, some people were about to bury a fresh corpse.</p><br/><p> It was Julia. His bride was smiling in her wedding dress, while the other girl was about to be buried.</p><br/><p> When they got in the carriage, Qin Guan decided to confess everything to his wife. Holding her hands, which were in pure white gloves, he said seriously and carefully, \"Drew, I used to work for the CIA.\"</p><br/><p> He was afraid to tell the truth, but he was eager to be understood by others.</p><br/><p> \"I have killed many people. Are you listening to me?\"</p><br/><p> His lips were trembling, and his eyebrows were furrowed. His long eyelashes were hanging low. His wife had stopped smiling. She was staring at Qin Guan in shock and horror.</p><br/><p> Then suddenly, she started laughing. \"Ha ha ha...\"</p><br/><p> The girl burst into unrestrained laughter, baring her white teeth.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan felt awful. He blinked as his wife kept laughing like crazy. Her long pearl earrings were swaying back and forth.</p><br/><p> He sniffled and sat up straight. \"Ha ha ha!\" Qin Guan turned his head around. She was still laughing. He turned around again, but she still kept laughing.</p><br/><p> Fine, let's laugh together. Qin Guan grimaced awkwardly, exposing his own teeth as he exchanged a glance with his wife.</p><br/><p> Okay, forget what I said. It was a joke.</p><br/><p> As time went by, three old men, each of them holding a gun, were looking back at their lives. They could recall what they had done, what kind of people they used to be and what dreams they had harbored as young men.</p><br/><p> The winner was the one who didn't commit suicide.</p><br/><p> This was Chuck's latest show and the last scene of \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\". They had nothing to do with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> That was a common shooting process. Maybe they would never see each other again after the farewell toast. Amid the large film industry, only a small group of people could find new work anywhere at any time.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was working in his store after being forced by Cong Nianwei. He Ming and Lan Jin had sent them the first goods.</p><br/><p> They had bought beautiful rattan Chinese baskets and a red carpet for the entrance. Their design paradise would be open soon.</p><br/><p> When the J Clothing store opened, Guo was idling about, admiring the products in the small store. In his opinion, they could bring something new to the city.</p><br/><p> Several designers were standing by the entrance, attracted by the proud name of the store: Beauty of the World.</p><br/><p> Lan Jin was carrying merchandise out of his car. He had been forced to work as a labor worker for free.</p><br/><p> \"Hey, careful! Teacher Rong's goods are worth their weight in gold!\"</p><br/><p> Lan Jin grimaced and collapsed on a deck chair by the entrance. He sneered as Qin Guan took out the products one by one.</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m not blaming you, but just look at that rubbish! Your Teacher Rong is mediocre.\"</p><br/><p> You try and say that before her.</p><br/><p> \"Look at this! A wooden mask! Why did you ask me to carry it from so far away?\"</p><br/><p> Cong Nianwei cast a supercilious look at him. \"It's a Nuo Opera [1] mask. You have forgotten your ancestors.\"</p><br/><p> As she hung the wooden mask on the wall, she explained its history.</p><br/><p> \"These masks are even older than tattoos and colored drawings. They showed the actors\u2019 expressions by using the five sense organs and different decorations. It was typical plastic arts. Look at the smooth lines... They are full of beauty, ferocity, savageness and moral integrity.\"</p><br/><p> The masks looked as if they were alive. A gentle middle-aged man at the entrance spoke up when Cong Nianwei was finished.</p><br/><p> \"How much does it cost?\" He pointed to the first mask.</p><br/><p> \"500 dollars.\"</p><br/><p> Lan Jin held his breath.</p><br/><p> The man's eyes were fixed on the mask. Despite the mess inside the store, he picked it up without hesitation.</p><br/><p>[1] One of the oldest operas, which combined a sacrifice ceremony, singing and dancing. It can be dated back to the Shang and Zhou Dynasty (1600 BC-256 BC).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

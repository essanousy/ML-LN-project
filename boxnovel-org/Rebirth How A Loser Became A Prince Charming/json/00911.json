Those crazy fans had gone there with flags and slogans to cheer on their idol.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, my love!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, welcome back!\"</p><br/><p>Individuals, teams from Columbia, and other organizations had crowded around the site, which now looked like a demonstration venue. Some passers-by had also gathered around.</p><br/><p>Although the crowd was standing behind the lines, some crazy fans could still attack the crew if they wanted. Such an incident would be a disaster, so Director Lawrence decided to dismiss the fans and expand the barricaded area.</p><br/><p>The assistant director rejected the idea immediately, for fear that it would anger the fans. He proposed another idea instead.</p><br/><p>\"They've come here for Qin Guan. We were not able to keep our shooting location a secret. I could just ask him to appease his fans. If they're satisfied, then everything will be okay.\"</p><br/><p>Lawrence looked convinced. \"Okay, let Qin Guan try.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan agreed to the plan without hesitation. He had his own idea about how to handle the situation. As he approached the line, a short figure at the front of the crowd confirmed his speculation.</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoxiao was Qin Guan's best friend in the US, so every time he returned to New York, he would show up immediately. Qin Guan never hid his schedule from him.</p><br/><p>Xu was standing among the group from Columbia, waving a flag.</p><br/><p>Although he felt helpless, Qin Guan still put on his warmest smile.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, everyone!\"</p><br/><p>The fans were shocked. They had only expected to catch a glimpse of Qin Guan from afar, yet their idol was standing right before them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sure was a considerate guy.</p><br/><p>After a short silence, everyone suddenly burst into cheers.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is here!\"</p><br/><p>\"This is the first time I see him in person!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm the happiest person in the world!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! You are the pride of Columbia!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! We love you!\"</p><br/><p>They all screamed and cried, hugging each other tightly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved at them with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you all for coming here to cheer me on. As you can see, this is a big-budget production. No one would block the whole square just for me. This is definitely special treatment. Even the president would be jealous of me.\"</p><br/><p>The fans burst into laughter before gradually calming down.</p><br/><p>\"As you know, this is my first A-level film in the US. This is the best production that any Asian actor has ever participated in. This is a milestone in my career, so I'm really lucky to have you with me right now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks to you, I'm not bearing this pressure alone. You are here to help me face this challenge. I hope you can stay and give me your positive energy while I shoot my first scene.\"</p><br/><p>\"You will not regret this trip. Today, I'll give my best performance for all the people who love me and I love.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you all.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

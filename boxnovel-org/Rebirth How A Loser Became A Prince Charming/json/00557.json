Plus, this was only the group discussing online. There was still the offline audience to consider.</p><br/><p>After some careful thinking, everyone was cheered up by the news.</p><br/><p>Their PR agency also sent them the results of their large-scope audience survey.</p><br/><p>Gender Ratio: 2:8</p><br/><p>Age range: 14-34</p><br/><p>It was the target group they had been aiming at! Everyone was excited about the details. This meant that CW\u2019s program was popular! It would be a big source of money!</p><br/><p>\"We should get a bottle of champagne to celebrate!\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\" Tyra Banks was the most prudent person in the room. \"Let\u2019s leave the celebration for tomorrow, when we get the audience ratings of all the TV stations all over the country.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Champagne only costs 19 dollars. I bought one from the supermarket downstairs. If we get good audience ratings, I\u2019ll wear my Karl Lagerfeld. It will go well with the occasion!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's it! A fashionable outfit designed by a famous designer and a classic Dom Perignon!\"</p><br/><p>The man seemed wild with joy.</p><br/><p>Everyone was celebrating in advance, except Qin Guan, who was stupefied.</p><br/><p>The team was so cunning. They had included some unnecessary, controversial scenes in the episode in order to attract attention. Soon, the netizens were divided into different camps. The contestants who hadn\u2019t made the cut nearly threw their remote controls away. The whole world had seen them complain, curse and quarrel!</p><br/><p>I will die of embarrassment...</p><br/><p> Meanwhile, Qin Guan was thinking about something else. After his audition at Paramount the next day, the new semester would begin. He had become a celebrity during summer vacation, but what would he do when he faced his rigid professors again?</p><br/><p>He shivered at the thought. Cong Nianwei misunderstood his behavior and tried to comfort him. \"This is a reality show. You didn't have any accidents during filming, so you don't need to worry...\"</p><br/><p>Your concern is misplaced, but I\u2019m still touched...</p><br/><p>An air-conditioner could ease the scorching summer heat, but nothing could ease their fast, nervous heartbeats.</p><br/><p>The chief executive producer was sitting in his large chair. There was a bottle of champagne in the drawer of his desk. He had had hundreds of rounds in his office since early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his phone rang. He pressed the handsfree button and heard the sweet voice of his assistant.</p><br/><p>\"Good morning, Mr. William. What can I do for you?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m still waiting for the audience ratings.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait a minute, I\u2019ll check for you again...\"</p><br/><p>She hung up with a sigh. I\u2019m busy today! Why is he so nervous? He has called me five times in the last 20 minutes!</p><br/><p>Fanny sighed helplessly. Putting on her most professional smile, she got up and headed to the technical department again.</p><br/><p>\"Come in, Fanny!\" Winnie shouted at her. \"Here is the form you were waiting for. Take it to your director as soon as possible!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks!\"</p><br/><p>Fanny left with the form immediately. In one minute, William had gotten what he wanted.

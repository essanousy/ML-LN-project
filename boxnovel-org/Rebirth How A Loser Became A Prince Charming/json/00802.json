After a short stay in the capital, he would fly to Taiwan for another job. Only now did Qin Guan learn about the difficulties of filming a TV show and what shooting for a long time was like.</p><br/><p>He decided to be careful when agreeing to such TV shows in the future. Not having enough spare time didn't match his concept of satisfying work.</p><br/><p>As he thought about this, he shook his head miserably and took another bite of iced watermelon.</p><br/><p>Crack! It was so crisp and sweet...</p><br/><p>\"This is so good, Wang!\"</p><br/><p>\"I know! The seller did not even count the change.\"</p><br/><p>She and Qin Guan were very much alike. A watermelon cost very little, but Wang had still asked for a discount.</p><br/><p>The director got angry at the large group surrounding Qin Guan. They had been having so much fun that they had forgotten to save a piece of watermelon for her.</p><br/><p>\"What are you guys doing? Why are you eating watermelon? Get ready for the next scene!\"</p><br/><p>Instead of stopping, Qin Guan sped up.</p><br/><p>\"You! Qin Guan! Don't look at the others! Put the watermelon down. Where is the stylist? Who will help him change into his costume?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked down at his open robe and sweaty chest. There was still a seed on his face.</p><br/><p>Damn! I have to fasten all the buttons again. I hate this f*cking sticky weather! Qin Guan murmured as he wiped his mouth and returned to the set.</p><br/><p>\"The art of coitus, the second to last scene.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Baoguo and Qin Guan entered the sleeping chamber of the Qin Palace. For the sake of politics, Tian Fei was trying to persuade Emperor Han Wu to be intimate with Chen Ajiao.</p><br/><p>The cameras followed them as they walked.</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty, as your uncle, I would like to remind Your Majesty to cherish and trust the empress. Be gentle with her.\"</p><br/><p>He smiled meaningfully at the emperor. The middle-aged man still looked like a nobody. There was a wretched expression on his face as he stressed the word \"gentle\".</p><br/><p>Chen Baoguo had a faint smile on his face. He sat by the handrails of the passage, his red robe and black cloak making him look dashing. Although he was not a handsome young man, he was one of the best actors in China.</p><br/><p>The two of them had a tacit understanding.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen asked, \"What do you mean by 'gentle', uncle?\"</p><br/><p>His raised voice sounded frivolous. He had experience with a lot of women and girls. He was good at conquering, not being a gentleman.</p><br/><p>Taken aback, Qin Guan fixed his eyes on Chen's serious face for a few seconds. Then he licked his lips and swallowed.</p><br/><p>He held up his fist towards Chen and spread his fingers, squeezing the words out of his throat with profound weight.</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty should learn about the advantages of harm and benefit, as well as silence and action.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan whispered to his nephew. He was not shameless enough to speak loudly.</p><br/><p>Chen shot a suspicious look at a certain part of his uncle's body and then shook his head. I have made this very clear! Don't you understand?</p><br/><p>Feeling helpless, Qin Guan took out a painting roll and spread it before Chen as if it was a priceless treasure.</p><br/><p>It was a French postcard from his collection.</p><br/><p>Chen grabbed it out of his hand and pulled him away. He wanted to desert his benefactor as soon as his help was required. The anger in Qin Guan's eyes could kill his own nephew.</p><br/><p>Chen looked at the painting in amusement. He even pointed to one of the figures. \"This guy looks like you, uncle.\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible!\" Qin Guan hastened to deny it.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Director Hu was the first to burst into laughter. The onlookers did the same. Qin Guan immediately pulled his robe open. The lining was soaked with sweat once again.</p><br/><p>Chen Baoguo was also suffering from the heat. He was portraying a guy from Northern China, so his costume was even thicker than Qin Guan's.</p><br/><p>Annoyed to see Qin Guan take off his clothes at a professional speed, he spoke with the same meaningful tone he had during the scene, \"I'll study that skill with you later at night, uncle. Is that okay with you?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Their only advantage was that the professional teams had no interest in talking with young students. This made them feel at ease.</p><br/><p>Nobody was looking at the deserted stage, as it was not the time for the results to be announced yet. This was not a lively entertainment show, so no staff was needed. </p><br/><p>Actually, everyone was wrong. Every person present was being monitored, from the first person to arrive in the meeting room, to the last one to take their seat nervously.</p><br/><p>The monitors were the sponsors of the competition and the developers of the new internet community. Those young rich men had used their family wealth to take advantage of the internet. Combining the industry with commerce was the best way to challenge the stereotype that the internet was a futile economy.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was hard to tell if it was the real estate industry or the internet that were futile. This was enough for ordinary people though. At least they could see something tangible instead of a theoretical concept. They would gladly pay for that.</p><br/><p>The young billionaires were quite different from old billionaires when it came to business. They were a lot more frivolous, but the cunning decision-makers on their team planned on selecting the final winner carefully.</p><br/><p>When they saw that the eight remaining designs had their own merits and no obvious flaws, the young men decided to follow their hearts.</p><br/><p>The meeting room, which was where the monitors were installed, became the final place of the selection.</p><br/><p>\"Look at that old fellow! He is adjusting his tie and asking his assistant to prepare a statement for him. He is so confident!\"</p><br/><p>The man, who was a middle-aged designer, was the one with the most seniority and abundant power among the candidates. Sadly, he was considered too old to win.</p><br/><p>\"Look at the two girls on those two teams. I'll bet you 100 dollars that they are enemies. They must hate each other, because one of them has bigger boobs and a flatter bottom than the other.\"</p><br/><p>The young man had to be a mind-reader. That certainly explained his success.</p><br/><p>The unreliable judges cried out when Cong Nianwei's team entered the room.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Those guys are younger than us!\"</p><br/><p>\"Let me see\u2026 They are the Architecture Department of Columbia University\u2026 That explains it...\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" one of them screamed. The others glowered at him.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"Where is he?\"</p><br/><p> The yacht club of the Chinese students had penetrated the local circle, so Qin Guan's name was brought up frequently among Chinese people. He was an idol for them, so he attracted a lot of attention from local rich men.</p><br/><p>A model was not worth their attention, but a young man with his own fashion studio, accounting firm and gallery at such a young age was famous amid the younger generation.</p><br/><p>That was when they spotted the mysterious man at their competition. Did this mean that the busy man was trying to find more career opportunities through their contest?</p><br/><p>They were reading too much into the situation. Qin Guan had no idea they even existed. He had nothing to do with architecture. He was just sitting silently in the back row of the meeting room, trying his best to remain unnoticed.</p><br/><p>He had only gone there for his girlfriend.</p><br/><p>The trees liked their calm and quiet, but the wind would not subside. The people behind the monitors got excited.</p><br/><p>\"Let me see! What is he doing here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Search online! Are there any news reports about him?\"</p><br/><p>Brian, who was the only sensible person among them, suddenly realized something.</p><br/><p>\"If my memory serves me, his girlfriend must be a student at Columbia. Look!\" He pointed at the screen. \"Isn't that Asian girl his girlfriend?\" he asked the others.</p><br/><p>\"So what do you think? Who should win?\"</p><br/><p>\"The eighth team, of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan's team!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm on Qin Guan's side!\" they all said together. The old friends burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Their design meets the requirements. Plus, it's simpler and more convenient than the other designs.\"</p><br/><p>\"Most importantly, they chose cheaper materials. The property tax won't scare young people away.\"</p><br/><p>\"The most important thing is...\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha...\" Everyone laughed proudly with their hands on their waists.</p><br/><p>\"Microsoft and IBM are suppressing us on all fields. Peripheral industry, prospect investment, employee development\u2026 Even their private doctors are better than ours. We finally have something they don't!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! When the residents settle in, we'll tell the media that Qin Guan is our architect's boyfriend!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

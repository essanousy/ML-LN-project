It's blocked!\"</p><br/><p>Before the driver's curse could fade away, Qin Guan saw several suspicious guys walking up to them with weapons.</p><br/><p>\"Keep moving!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" Everyone felt the danger getting closer.</p><br/><p>Half-blooded youngsters holding stones and steel pipes were hiding in dark corners of the city like robbers. They destroyed and burned cars along the streets.</p><br/><p>Bang! A blare came from afar. It had to be an explosion-hazard siren.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, please! Keep moving! We'll find another way to the hotel!\" The calm French driver started sweating.</p><br/><p>The small-scale suburban chaos had spread downtown. The attackers didn't look like unarmed rebels, but an organized group. It was too dangerous to keep driving in the city.</p><br/><p>The car in front of them suddenly screeched to a halt. Another road was blocked by a mob of armed policemen.</p><br/><p>\"Turn around! Reverse! Don't get involved!\"</p><br/><p>Dealing with bombs and explosions would be dangerous for anyone. \"What should I do?\"</p><br/><p>All the roads had been blocked. They were in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Those French guys are so much trouble!\"</p><br/><p>Jean wasted no time in making fun of English actors in return. As a native, he knew that this area was not safe.</p><br/><p>\"Would the Louvre give us shelter in case of an emergency?\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible!\" Jean shook his head at Qin Guan. \"Their steel gates close if the artwork is in danger. They do not even disclose who or what poses a threat to them. The building must be under siege now. We won't get in.\"</p><br/><p>In some Parisians' eyes, artwork was even more precious than human lives.</p><br/><p>They were unfortunately trapped in this reality. As everyone fell into a depressed silence, Qin Guan pondered the issue and asked another question.</p><br/><p>\"But the main street is still clear. Can't we just drive down that road till we get to a safe place?\"</p><br/><p>\"That road can only be used by the police. If the main street was blocked, the city would be compromised.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is there a shelter around this area then?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, this is a sight-seeing area. Next thing you'll be asking to climb up the Arch of Triumph!\"</p><br/><p>Okay, Jean Reno was clearly not a killer. He was just a kind French guy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed sorrowfully. Suddenly, he had an idea.</p><br/><p>\"I know! I can drive to the Chinese embassy down the street! It's not far from here! Wang, call the embassy! Let's go, director!\"</p><br/><p>All the British and French actors looked at Qin Guan as if he was an idiot. Even though they were natives, they hadn't thought of taking refuge in the City Hall or a police station, yet that foreigner had dared make a direct call to the embassy!</p><br/><p>Wang Liying was a smart girl, so she contacted the embassy and cleared the situation in a few seconds. When they got a definite response, they headed straight to the embassy.</p><br/><p>No one cared about speed limit violations now, so they drove down the street at full speed.</p><br/><p>\"There are still 200 meters left between the main street and the embassy. How will we cover that distance?\"</p><br/><p>\"Just rush!\"</p><br/><p>\"If there are still policemen around...\"</p><br/><p>\"That's impossible!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why?\" Jean had suddenly stopped talking. He had seen a smooth path cleared by some ordinary men. The embassy was quiet amid the noisy downtown area.</p><br/><p>The guards helped them get into the embassy and get out of the cars. They only felt safe and able to relax again when the gate was closed behind them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

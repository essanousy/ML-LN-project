Pleased by this narrow escape, he promised Cong Nianwei repeatedly that they would watch it together. Then he suddenly saw Wang Liying rush over to him. She seemed both angry and proud.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was really curious about the expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\"What happened? You've come at just the right moment. I'll fly to Thailand directly from Shanghai and stay there for a week. Chen Kang and Han Zhujiu will be staying with me. Old accommodation rules. This is a private trip for a friend's wedding. You will need to keep tabs on all my confidential work. So what happened? Is it anything interesting?\"</p><br/><p>Wang was happy with the understanding between her and Qin Guan. It would certainly lead to a successful career for her. Her salary was rising rapidly. It had only been one year, yet she was already earning 7,200 yuan a month. She was really satisfied with that.</p><br/><p>Plus, she also earned commission from Qin Guan's films and TV series, which made her basically a wealthy woman. That was why Wang was so dedicated to her job. Besides, she also got to work with her idol!</p><br/><p>She shared her information with Qin Guan happily.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, you truly are my confidant. Did you hear the news about your QC firm? The crew of 'The Promise' is completely shameless. They released their film in advance to get ahead of the negative news about the lawsuit! Director Zhang just called me to tell me his decision. He will release his film according to the original plan. He informed me about the preparations for the premi\u00e8re.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not surprised by the news. There was still more trouble on the way.</p><br/><p>\"Anything else?\"</p><br/><p>\"There is also a private matter. It concerns your friend Nicholas Tse.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is it? He is in the Philippines right now with his girlfriend. What happened to him? This is not the right moment. [1]\"</p><br/><p>\"Right moment?\"</p><br/><p>Wang seemed confused. Qin Guan felt really nervous.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing. I was just thinking about other things. Go on.\"</p><br/><p>\"The couple's photos made the entertainment section headlines, but the news about Wang Fei replaced them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wang Fei? What happened to her?\"</p><br/><p>\"She gave birth to Li Yapeng's daughter. The girl has a hare lip. She has to have an operation.\"</p><br/><p>The famous affair between the two stars was really complicated. Although she had married Li Yapeng, Wang Fei was still a cool woman stuck on her old ways. Li was not the master of the house by any means. After their daughter's misfortune, the couple had decided to establish a fund for kids suffering from the same disease.</p><br/><p>The disease was not too serious. It could actually be cured after several operations when one was a child. The cost of the surgery was several thousand yuan though, so some poor families couldn't afford it.</p><br/><p>The fund would help those poor kids change their lives. It was because of his daughter that Li had paid attention to the group.</p><br/><p>Shocked by the couple's kindness, Qin Guan considered the possibility of making a donation. Li had been really kind to him at the beginning of his career after all. After their collaboration on \"The Legend Of The Swordsman\", Qin Guan had gotten his private number.</p><br/><p>His personal loyalty kicked in, making him sign a cheque and hand Li's number to Wang.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for keeping me up to date. I'll tell Sister Xue to increase your salary by 300 yuan. Send the cheque to Li as a gift for her daughter. It's my donation to the Yanran Fund.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

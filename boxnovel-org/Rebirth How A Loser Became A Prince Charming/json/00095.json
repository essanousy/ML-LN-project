Qin Guan felt unconsciously fainthearted. Shall I go over and say hello, or pretend I don\u2019t know them? He had underestimated his attractive appearance though.</p><br/><p>He was always a shining bulb, attracting attention anywhere he went. His face was currently buried in crays, but the surrounding customers became aware of him as soon as he looked up. Wang Hailiang saw Qin Guan and nudged Bu Qinglu, who was sitting beside him. \"I think we know that guy over there.\"</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu, who was tearing at a duck neck, glanced in that direction. He bit hard at the bone and said, \"Do you remember that interesting boy we met at the Red Star Bar before the Spring Festival?\"</p><br/><p>\"The Red Star Bar?\"</p><br/><p>\"The boy who used your name to scare his enemy and called himself the big brother of the University of Finance. Did you forget him? You said you\u2019d protect every student of his college.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang was enlightened. That\u2019s why I thought he looked familiar. Interesting!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was trying to hide, but Wang held up a bottle of beer to make a toast.</p><br/><p>They discovered me! They noticed my rude behaviour! Qin Guan choked on the chilli and began to cough.</p><br/><p>Wang was amused. With a playful intention, he stood up groggily and murmured something to his company. Then he lifted the bottle, planning to make a toast to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He should be honored that a real big brother is making a toast to him. The others took it as a joke. They were just looking at the students, taking pleasure in Qin Guan\u2019s misfortune.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was scared. Oh, my god! How will I deal with him?</p><br/><p>\"Do you know him? Is he an enemy?\" Ye Dong asked him in low voice.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gestured to his roommates. \"Don\u2019t worry about it. He\u2019s just an acquaintance. I don\u2019t know him that well, but he\u2019s not looking for trouble.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang suddenly remembered something and whispered to Qin Guan excitedly, \"Is he Wang Hailiang, the most renowned man in Weigongcun? Everyone here will support him!\" You little boy! You also know those kind of circles?</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan had tensed up. He picked up a bottle from the table, but it was plum syrup, a gift from the restaurant.</p><br/><p>He will make a toast to me. Shall I toast with plum syrup?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was an emergency. A man cut Wang Hailiang\u2019s way and stared at him fiercely. \"Wang Hailiang, you motherf*cker!\" he cried before stabbing Wang with an iron pike used for kebab. His intentions were clear, and all his attention was on his weapon, a pointed pike shining with an ice-cold light. The light in his eyes was even colder. He was risking his life.</p><br/><p>As a veteran soldier, Wang\u2019s reaction time was much faster than ordinary people\u2019s. Although he was slightly drunk, he had the most logical response. Estimating that the pike would end up in his stomach, he curved his waist to the right side with effort. At the same time, he hit the man\u2019s head with the bottle in his hand.</p><br/><p>The attacker smiled savagely. I\u2019m no green hand. I know that you value your life. I had already calculated your move. The man shouted loudly, and the pike changed direction with a shake, stabbing into Wang\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu and the other men at their table stood up, but they were too far to help Wang. They still tried their best to run over to stop the assassin though. Otherwise, Wang would die from the attack.</p><br/><p>\"Bang!\"</p><br/><p>Several chairs fell on the floor. The other customers were rooted to the spot in fear, and the waiter was screaming loudly before the dangerous scene. The criminal was on the verge of insanity. Regardless of everyone\u2019s interference, his only aim was to stab Wang to death.</p><br/><p>Just before his weapon stabbed into Wang\u2019s stomach, Qin Guan threw the glass bottle in his hand and hit his wrist. It was a large bottle with more than one litre of plum syrup, so it changed the direction of the pike to another part of Wang's body.</p><br/><p>The attacker couldn't slow down and knocked Wang to the floor. The two men fell together. The beer bottle was smashed on the head of the attacker at the same time that the man\u2019s pike entered Wang's body. Glass shards and beer were raining down on his face. Wang held the pike tightly as he used his spare hand to seize the man\u2019s wrist. By that time, Bu Qinglu had reached them. He grabbed the attacker\u2019s arm and twisted it at the elbow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

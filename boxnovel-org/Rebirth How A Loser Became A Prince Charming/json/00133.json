They Are All Martial Artists!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lan Editor: Efydatia</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s irascible temper made him want to beat John, but Mou Xiaoliu, the irritable bear, rushed at him instead.</p><br/><p>That foreign tough man with the red nose and the green eyes dared proposition my prince!</p><br/><p>\"Bear\u2019s fist!\" she shouted loudly, showing her five-element fist art, which was passed down from generation to generation in her family. She had been born with extraordinary power, so she beat the tall man to the ground.</p><br/><p>Darkness covered John\u2019s eyes, countless golden spots shining in his vision. He had been beaten by a soft girl with only one try.</p><br/><p>The girl named Huang Jiajia seems kind-hearted. She looks like she\u2019s going to help me up. Suddenly, John felt her bag hit him in the stomach.</p><br/><p>Now I have only two saviors left. Oh, no! There\u2019s only Qin Guan left. His girlfriend is stomping on my fingers with her high heels!</p><br/><p>John was in complete despair before the Asian girls. They seem soft and small, but they are all martial artists.</p><br/><p>He stared at Qin Guan with watery eyes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan squatted down and pulled Cong Nianwei up. \"She is my girlfriend, understand?\" John nodded energetically.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not homosexual or bisexual. My heart belongs only to her. Got it? Now, shall we be brothers? Friends?\"</p><br/><p>Glancing at the girls, who were looking at him jealously, John understood the situation and stretched his hand out towards Qin Guan. \"Good brothers. For life.\"</p><br/><p>A transnational friendship was formed that moment. Qin Guan was gorgeous, but his guards were horrible. Anyone would have made the right choice between life and desire.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made a good foreign friend, and John joined the group easily after being rejected as a romantic interest.</p><br/><p>I can't enjoy a private dinner with Cong Nianwei now. I have to have dinner with my followers.</p><br/><p>A saying said that one had to conquer a man\u2019s stomach before conquering his heart. Therefore, the best and quickest way to make a foreigner realize his ignorance was by treating them to authentic Chinese dishes.</p><br/><p>It was uncommon for Qin Guan to be extravagant with dinner, yet he took them to the Fengzeyuan Restaurant.</p><br/><p>For a foodie, that restaurant was the Holy Land. It had been founded in 1930, and it featured authentic Shandong cuisine. As an old famous restaurant, it was considered one of the top eight restaurants in the old capital.</p><br/><p>It was renowned for its delicate dishes and pure style, and it was a favorite of high-ranking officials, dignitaries and celebrities. Ever since its reconstruction, it was considered a three-star restaurant. (You should try its dishes if you visit Beijing. Many national leaders have treated their private and official guests there.)</p><br/><p>John was intoxicated by the kickshaws even before eating.</p><br/><p>There were braised sea cucumbers with scallion, dried cooked crucian, Fengzeyuan carbonado with special flavour, and cuttlefish roe soup. Qin Guan was really generous. John was so busy filling his mouth with food that he nearly swallowed his own tongue.</p><br/><p>He felt like he had been eating pig feed for the past 20 years. He realized that he had been living his life in vain. Even the potatoes were sliced into differently shaped pieces. Everything seemed too noble for his eyes.</p><br/><p>Another fan of Chinese cuisine had been born! He was cheated into having a mouthful of crucian with lots of fishbones, and his opinion of that fish changed completely.</p><br/><p>Actually, he had never eaten fish with bones before. The crisp bones were nearly melted into the flesh. I can eat all of them!</p><br/><p>John was fascinated by Chinese cuisine after that dinner.</p><br/><p>On the flight heading back to the US, he took out the fried breadsticks, which his assistant had bought at a small stand for 0.25 yuan, and took a bite.</p><br/><p>Wonderful! \"Hi, my lady. Could I have some sugar? Yes, two packages.\"</p><br/><p>He scattered the granulated sugar, which was actually meant for coffee, on the breadsticks. He even forgot to accost the airline stewardess and flirt a little with her. He could only see the breadsticks.</p><br/><p>His assistant proudly took out a deep-fried dough cake with brown sugar. I will never tell John I\u2019m having a more delicious breakfast than him!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that he had made a small change in the life of a friend. After the poster of the J shirts, he was out of work again. The LEE advertisment had put Sister Xue in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>Ordinary jobs were no longer suitable for Qin Guan, while better ones were always taken by somebody else. She was looking for the reason why.</p><br/><p>The several advertisements and inner pages of magazines that he had participated in had influenced Qin Guan's life. He realized that he could now be considered a small rising star after his parents called him one day.</p><br/><p>They had seen Qin Guan in a fashion magazine a younger workmate of theirs had been reading. The young girl was in the same office as Qin Guan's mother, and she had put a torn magazine on the common newspaper shelf.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan repeatedly promised his parents that his part-time jobs would not influence his studies. Reassured, his parents hung up. For conservative parents, getting a good job after graduation was the best way to proceed in life.</p><br/><p>Of course, Qin Guan hadn't mentioned his income. If they knew that his yearly income matched their total salary, they might have started to doubt the value of their work.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of his spare time, Qin Guan devoted himself to his courses. The Accounting Qualification Examination was approaching.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had applied for the exam back in January. There were three subjects, including Financial Regulations and Accounting Professional Ethics, Accounting Basics, and Accounting Computerization. He had to pass all three exams at once. The first two subjects were scheduled on the first day, and on the second day, the candidates would work on a PC.</p><br/><p>Wang Lei couldn't understand Qin Guan's decision. As students at the University of Finance and Economics, their college would automatically issue a qualification certificate to them along with their diplomas.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had set a clear goal for himself though. He wouldn't be satisfied with only one certificate after four years of studying.</p><br/><p>He had unparalleled confidence in himself. He had been preparing for that day since the day he had entered university.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They told everyone that his butt was swollen, and as a result Qin Guan got a new nickname. People called him \"the poor guy with the swollen butt\".</p><br/><p>Annoyed, Qin Guan slept on his stomach, groaning and moaning all night long. He didn't feel any better the next day. As he was brushing his teeth in the morning, he was thinking about something important. I have no energy to go buy the newspaper today. Who could I ask for help?</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang would be a good choice. When Qin Guan returned to the dormitory, he took a coin out of his pocket. \"Could you please buy a newspaper for me? I\u2019m too sore to go out today.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang took the coin and jumped off his bed happily. \"Which one do you want? Capital Weekend or Capital Daily?\" he asked Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan answered calmly, \"Capital Entertainment.\"</p><br/><p>His answer made Wang Lei curious. College students were seldom interested in that paper. \"You never pay attention to entertainment news. Why do you want to buy that newspaper?\" he asked.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled to himself. He was happy someone had asked. Pretending to be calm, he answered, \"No reason, I just gave an interview to the newspaper, and I\u2019m curious about what it says. That\u2019s why I want to buy it.\" His acting made everyone curious.</p><br/><p>\"Why did they interview you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Didn't you just win that magazine photoshoot? Why did that newspaper interview you in such a short time?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan coughed and answered indifferently, \"Oh, it\u2019s nothing important. I just returned to college earlier and participated in a competition with my agent. I accidentally was the capital winner. The photoshoot was one of the prizes. It was just an ordinary job with a poor 1,000 yuan reward. Then I participated in the national competition and won that as well. It was so boring. I had no competition at all. It was boring as hell!\"</p><br/><p>Then he threw his hair back and struck a pose.</p><br/><p>His roommates spoke simultaneously, \"You slut!\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang went out happily. When he returned, they all gathered to read the newspaper.</p><br/><p>The front-page headline was about the actors of \"Princess Pearl\", the most popular TV series at the time. Any news about the series were breaking news in the media. They turned the front page, but there was nothing; the second page, still nothing. They went through all eight pages, but found nothing at all about Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>It was impossible! Qin Guan took the newspaper and scanned it from beginning to end. Finally, he found the short interview at the bottom of the front page. His photos with Ouyang Fen was as large as half a cigarette pack. No one could recognize Qin Guan without a magnifying glass. Together with the article, the whole interview was the size of a whole cigarette pack.</p><br/><p>Readers would hardly pay attention to such a short interview.</p><br/><p>\"Why such a short interview? He was the winner...\"</p><br/><p>\"Models have a small audience in China.\"</p><br/><p>\"Film or TV stars at least get familiar with their audience. Poor Qin Guan. To this day, there has never been a renowned model.\"</p><br/><p>As they talked, Qin Guan read the article, which presented him as the new shining star of the capital model circle. I will be modest about it!</p><br/><p>He took a pair of scissors from the drawer and cut the interview off. The newspaper was distributed only in the capital. I have to save it to show off at home during the Spring Festival. I\u2019ll share the good news with Cong Nianwei!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei hung up the phone and burst into laughter. What a silly boyfriend! I\u2019ll buy the newspaper just to encourage him.</p><br/><p>Huan Jiajia got up unprecedentedly early to buy the newspaper with the excuse of buying breakfast for her parents. The rest of the pages of the newspaper were used to wrap fried bread sticks.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile somewhere else, Ouyang Fen was carefully cutting the interview off and pasting it into a large notebook. Pressing the edges of the paper, he smiled in satisfaction at his cousin\u2019s expression of both dislike and joy. My brother has made his first step towards success.</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan was escorted into the classroom by Wang Lei and his pillow. He walked in a jerky, uneven way. Everyone\u2019s attention was on him as usual. That was the magic of beauty. His status that day had inspired everyone. Under the attention of millions of people, Qin Guan sat down carefully on his chair. He didn\u2019t forget to put the pillow under his butt first.</p><br/><p>\"What's wrong with him? Why is he walking that way?\"</p><br/><p>\"He must be hurt. Did you see the pillow?\"</p><br/><p>\"His butt was hurt!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha...\"</p><br/><p>\"How can someone hurt their butt?\" It was a valid question.</p><br/><p>...\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha... You betcha...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt stranger and stranger by the minute. He poked Wang Lei, who was sitting beside him, and asked him, \"What\u2019s wrong with them? Why are they looking at me? Is there anything on my face?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Lei didn\u2019t look at him. \"Maybe there\u2019s some rice. Feel it yourself.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan touched his lips as he looked at Wang Lei.</p><br/><p>\"See?\"</p><br/><p>\"Did Wang Lei hurt his butt? Impossible! It\u2019s rumored that Qin has a girlfriend in QH.\"</p><br/><p>\"Poor him! He must be exhausted!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If the design was extraordinary, Qin Guan would recommend the designer to Mr. Armani.</p><br/><p>This would be an unprecedented honor for any designer. No one had any time to appreciate Qin Guan's beauty.</p><br/><p>We're going to be famous!</p><br/><p>Tim was happy to see that.</p><br/><p>\"Your beauty won't be invincible forever, Qin Guan. Good looks are nothing compared to fame and profit.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall I take care of this, boss?\" Han Zhujiu asked.</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to explain to Han Zhujiu the difference between a joke and an insult.</p><br/><p>It was a miracle that Tim had survived so many years in the fashion circle.</p><br/><p>The man had no idea how lucky he was. The next day, he went back to his old ways. As soon as the designers hung their creations up, he got to work.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! What's this? It looks like rubbish.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's a suit for a gentleman. What's that lace for? Qin Guan is married!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh my! I thought you'd make a gorgeous outfit, but this is trash!\"</p><br/><p>\"What a disaster! This is an insult to the fashion circle, the Venice Film Festival and Qin Guan himself. Come here, Qin Guan! What's your opinion?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? Qin Guan? Where are you?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is trying on the first outfit,\" the host reminded him helplessly.</p><br/><p>If they had to meet Tim's standards, the program would have been cancelled long ago. As Tim was delivering his speech, Qin Guan entered the fitting room.</p><br/><p>Professional models had to change clothes fast. Pretty soon, Qin Guan got on the stage in the first outfit.</p><br/><p>It was a mini T stage, so Qin Guan could finish a round in 10 seconds.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan displayed the power of a supermodel. Although the stage was small, he still did his best.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! Can you believe that this cost only 200 dollars?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's perfect posture made all the details of the first outfit unfold before the judges. Everyone suddenly realized how powerful the mysterious Asian model was.</p><br/><p>Everybody could act like a rich man in a gorgeous suit if they were trained a little, but it was not as easy to make a 200-dollar suit look like high fashion. Some people could even make clothes look cheaper than they were.</p><br/><p>This was actually a unique talent of Qin Guan's.</p><br/><p>He showed the judges the nine formal outfits really fast. When it came to men's suits, details mattered a lot.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no preferences, but the creation of a greenhand was not equal to that of a famous designer. Outsiders might think highly of the contestants, but their abilities were not good enough for Qin Guan. </p><br/><p>Thus, he made some neutral comments about them as a model.</p><br/><p>\"All the outfits are pretty good. They have their own vibe and style, but there is still room left for more details, personality and high-end tailoring. I think this was because of your tight schedule. I hope to see much better work at the New York Fashion Week. You will be given enough time then.\"</p><br/><p>This meant that he wouldn't select any of them for the time being. The Americans still interpreted his words in a positive way though.</p><br/><p>That's okay. In one day, I'll get the chance to cooperate with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>They were actually overthinking things. They hadn't even experienced the pressure and fierce competition between brands and designers. Those greenhands were really naive.</p><br/><p>Now that the show was finished, Qin Guan could relax until the fashion week. However, Tim thought that Qin Guan did not care enough about the show. As an experienced man in the circle, he thought that he had found a good friend in Qin Guan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Asian model-slash-actor was sitting across the table.</p><br/><p>He was in a casual grey short-sleeved polo shirt. His short hair seemed to shine in the meeting room. Those long eyelashes, that straight nose, those sexy lips, those charming eyes... People from different brands noticed the advantages of Qin Guan's body.</p><br/><p>Qu concluded that it was a good choice to have Qin Guan attend the meeting.</p><br/><p>When they left the meeting room, Qingmu, who had been sitting behind Qin Guan, seemed to beg him with his eyes. Introduce me, please!</p><br/><p>Qu saw him as soon as he entered the meeting room and shot a worried look at him. \"Qin Guan, who is this gentleman?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qingmu, the director of Citizen in North America. We used to cooperate back in China.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made a short introduction as Qu smiled in a meaningful way. Despite the fact that he was the director of a famous brand, he felt a chill go down his spine. He felt like a pupil looking up at the teacher nervously. Qu's answer would decide his fate.</p><br/><p>\"I just signed a representative contract with Vacheron Constantin in North America.\"</p><br/><p>A thunder struck Qingmu. What shall I do? What shall I do?</p><br/><p>\"What shall I do?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shrugged as Qu turned on him. \"Are you an idiot? You will be their representative in North America, not across the whole world. Yamaguchi-gumi is unhappy with Qin Guan's absence in Japan. You should talk with the headquarters to add a model to the Asian representatives. New products, traditional sets\u2026 Anyone will do. Then your work will be finished. You don't need to compensate them for breaking your contract in North America.\"</p><br/><p>Scared, Qingmu came back to his senses. That\u2019s a good idea!</p><br/><p>They turned around and looked at Qin Guan, who seemed shocked. \"I have no time to work in Asia. Sister Xue rejected that contract because of my tight schedule.\"</p><br/><p>Qingmu remembered. That's right. This was why Qin Guan had some differences with Citizen. The conversation returned to the original issue. Qingmu had to beg him again.</p><br/><p>As Qingmu tried to figure out how to convince him, Qu shot another supercilious look at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"You are in a favorable position, aren\u2019t you? Citizen has to fit into your schedule. We can shoot the advertisement in America. I think Mr. Qingmu's life is a priority compared to the extra expenses.\"</p><br/><p>Yes! Considering Qin Guan's value and status, nobody would oppose that plan. Besides, the Citizen PR department had to invest more in Qin Guan. It was a win-win situation. Qingmu felt like worshipping Qu.</p><br/><p>Qu tapped on a pile of paperwork.</p><br/><p>The Asian representative of Citizen\u2026 Qin Guan would get an annual salary of 10 million dollars. This was the lowest possible salary for a top model. By then, Qin Guan was qualified enough to be selected by international top fashion magazines and brands.</p><br/><p>The top 100 list was the highest honor for film stars, models and fashion insiders.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had nothing else to do there. Before he could leave though, the woman stopped him.</p><br/><p>\"Your latest schedule is on the board. Take it and pay attention to the dates.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw a quivering note on the board beside the door. It was not in its proper place, which implied the indifference of the person who\u2019d hung it.</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\" Qin Guan took the note and shut the door for Qingmu and Qu.</p><br/><p>\"So, Mr. Qingmu\u2026 Let's discuss the details...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan read the note carefully in the car.</p><br/><p>\"Special guest appearance on the TV program \u2018America\u2019s Next Top Model\u2019, Episode I, CW station.\"</p><br/><p>This was the first time Qin Guan would participate in a TV program. Considerably, his appearance had been scheduled on a weekend. Qin Guan recalled the invitation of the director of the program on the night he had competed against Chad.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stuffed the yellow note into his pocket and started his beloved car. My participation will make the program popular...</p><br/><p>The next day, Qin Guan headed to the registration office of the CW station in New York. The program accepted applications from all over the country and interviewed all the candidates.</p><br/><p>It was the last day of work. During the whole week, the participants had stood in a long line outside the large office. Qin Guan locked his car. Putting both hands in his pockets, he planned on entering the office by passing by the long line. The proud models were vigilant though.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, don't cut in line!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait for your turn, okay?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We finished the last scene! 'Perhaps, Love' is officially completed!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone cheered, laughed and jumped, all the while congratulating each other.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan laughed along with Zhou and pretended to be shooting at her with a gun.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had had the last laugh. He had kept up a mental and physical defense and won a medal for resisting her seduction.</p><br/><p>The unexpected gesture stunned Zhou, who turned his action over in her mind. She slowly smiled at Qin Guan. He must be one of those funny, childish guys...</p><br/><p>The man who was deeply in love with her only existed in the film and her imagination. That man was quite different from this one.</p><br/><p>The film was finally completed. The cameras were shut off as her imaginary lover melted in her hands along with the falling snowflakes.</p><br/><p>In 2004, the winter lingered on until spring. The cold wind brought along snowflakes that did not match the season. The large snowflakes were dancing in the sky like the fake ones used in films before finally landing on the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhou watched Qin Guan run happily in the snow. One minute later, he rushed back. \"F*ck! It's really cold!\" he complained.</p><br/><p>He had been so happy that he had forgotten that he had only been wearing a hoodie and a pair of slippers during his performance. Sister Xue covered him with his coat gently. The warm scene made everyone smile.</p><br/><p>The director invited all his friends to Beijing for a celebratory feast, but Sister Xue, who had gotten a call from overseas, had to turn down the invitation. </p><br/><p>Qin Guan's team was packing his luggage in his room. He sat down on the couch next to the door and left the room to them. Suddenly, the half-closed door opened.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xue leaned against the door frame and chatted with Qin Guan quietly.</p><br/><p>\"Are you leaving today?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. We have booked tickets.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you in such a hurry?\"</p><br/><p>\"The film festival I will be participating in is being pushed forward. I have to attend the award ceremony.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou fell silent. Does this mean that he will win another award? Maybe I should have sought an opportunity abroad.</p><br/><p>Zhou shook her head. She knew perfectly well that foreigners found her looks a little boring. Plus, her acting skills were too restrained for them.</p><br/><p>\"I thought I scared you away,\" she said, admiration and embarrassment filling her voice.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. \"Of course not, Sister Zhou. I know how things are between us.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou burst into laughter and took out a cigarette case.</p><br/><p>\"Light my cigarette for me before you go.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stood up from the couch and took the silver lighter. A small orange flame bloomed between his hands.</p><br/><p>His busy team and the passing cleaners in the white aprons seemed to walk in slow motion amid the smoke.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shut the lighter. When he looked up, he felt a pair of sweet-smelling lips brush against his jaw.</p><br/><p>\"Idiot!\"</p><br/><p>Zhou walked away with a strange feeling, leaving Qin Guan stupefied.</p><br/><p>Goodbye...</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had no time to pay attention to them. After confirming the schedule again, they left the hotel right away. Meanwhile, Director Chen was looking forward to a bright future with the other members of the crew.</p><br/><p>\"I wonder if my film will be lucky enough to win an award...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about Chen's ambitions. He had to show up on the red carpet of the opening ceremony as soon as he got off the plane.</p><br/><p>The staff of L'Or\u00e9al was considerately waiting for him on the site. After Qin Guan's schedule was confirmed, they would talk about their future cooperation.</p><br/><p>The Berlin Film Festival was the first European film festival to open in 2004. In an effort to beat the Cannes Festival, the organizing committee had permanently moved the date of the opening ceremony to February. Many stars were caught unprepared. As a result, the ones with no nominations turned down the invitation to the festival. That was why Qin Guan had gone to Berlin in a hurry.</p><br/><p>After negotiating with the crew of \"Lost Smile\", the organizing committee had sent Qin Guan an invitation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

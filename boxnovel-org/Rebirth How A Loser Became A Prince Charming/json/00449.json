Halls No. 2 to No. 4 were shaped like cubes and stationed on opposite sides. Hall No. 5 was the innermost one, a rare polygonal building.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was amazed by the architecture.</p><br/><p>\"You can idle around later, when I\u2019m at work. Michael has the blueprints of the buildings. I can ask him to give them to you. Did you bring your tools along?\"</p><br/><p>He paused suddenly. Cong Nianwei had taken her toolkit out of her large backpack. She is studying on our trip! It's wonderful to have a straight-A student as a girlfriend.</p><br/><p>The jewellery designer opened the refined chests one by one to reveal the best jewellery sets to the audience. Actually, the entire police force of the city had been stationed around the hall. If one added the top security agencies hired by the brands, the halls were as safe as a fortress. It would take bandits a month to raid them.</p><br/><p>Following the instructions of the designer, Qin Guan fastened a pair of sleeve buttons onto his white shirt. They were polished sapphires inlaid on platinum bases. The two materials were connected perfectly by filigree.</p><br/><p>To make the buttons stand out, Qin Guan took off his coat, leaving only his dark blue waistcoat and white shirt on.</p><br/><p>There was a pin of the same design on his tie. Unlike the buttons, the pin was made of rare obsidian, which looked steady and elegant on the tie.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan picked up a business cardholder as thin as a cicada's\u2019 wings. Its lid and bottom were carved from an entire sapphire.</p><br/><p>The coldness on his palm thrilled Qin Guan. It was a combination of the inspiration of one of the top jewellery designers and a fruit of the painstaking labor of craft masters.</p><br/><p>It was a three-piece set necessary for any man. Suddenly, the designer handed him a lighter made of pierced platinum and decorated by gems. Qin Guan nearly kneeled down in shock.</p><br/><p>I will never understand the world of the rich.</p><br/><p>The cracks of the firestone and the flames would destroy the precious metal. Only the price of its maintenance would be enough to cover an ordinary people\u2019s annual living expenses.</p><br/><p>They were only tiny things. Qin Guan couldn't express his feelings with words as he looked at a black wristwatch.</p><br/><p>Tiffany was famous for its simplicity and novelty, not for its expensive materials. The watch strap was made of black crocodile skin. Its best feature was the design of the dial. The figures were scrambled up with diamond pigments. The hands were as exquisite as ancient Roman spears. The white dial went well with the black hands and strap.</p><br/><p>The designer carefully adjusted the pin for Qin Guan. Then he packed up, leaving the black emperor's set to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Tiffany hadn\u2019t brought many models to the fair. Two men and four women were wearing the expensive jewellery, waiting for the press conference.</p><br/><p>At 10:00 a.m, visitors, buyers, agents and purchasers were pouring into the hall from all directions. Baselworld had lifted its veil, revealing its true face. The top exhibitors were competing against each other in all aspects.</p><br/><p>In Hall No. 5, Cartier's show ended just as Tiffany\u2019s press conference started close by.</p><br/><p>The crystal curtain rose slowly as the host made a speech. The audience shifted their attention from the brochures in their hands to the stage.</p><br/><p>\"The latest collection of Tiffany Jewellery combines simplicity with an ancient Roman style. The cost is reduced by the use of popular platinum and silver to win the approval of potential customers.\"</p><br/><p>Female models in backless dresses were showing off their earrings, necklaces, bracelets and rings. They looked splendid in the light.</p><br/><p>\"Our collection meets the demands of high-end customers all over the world. It's a perfect combination of oriental and occidental concepts and styles.\"</p><br/><p>\"Black is a noble color in the East and royal blue is a Western favorite. This set is called appropriately \u2018Emperor of the Night\u2019.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked on the stage slowly. The jewellery set was revealed to the audience, as if it was an emperor that had just arrived. The black buttons were standing out against the white shirt, like a black heron flying in the snow. Proud, yet elegant.</p><br/><p>The silver-black lighter in Qin Guan\u2019s slender fingers attracted everyone\u2019s attention. It was like a sword in the hands of a swordsman. The cold light was reflected on the expensive metal under the lamps. Only people with good eyesight could see the cardholder on his chest, as well as the pin on his tie, bringing all the jewellery pieces together.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

B*tch! She is acting all pure and shy now, but her eyes are fixed on Qin Guan's face. Is this really love at first sight?</p><br/><p>The two actors brushed against each other carefully on the narrow stairs. Qin Guan leaned to one side to make room for the petite girl, but his tall, strong figure still occupied too much space.</p><br/><p>His heart beat fast as her hair touched his jaw.</p><br/><p>When he reached the end of the stairs, Qin Guan looked back. So did Xu, who looked down shyly with a blush before leaving. Qin Guan was captivated by the girl.</p><br/><p>A silly, joyful smile formed on his face as he went out of the villa.</p><br/><p>\"Cut! Good!\" Director Yin couldn't help but play the scene back again and again. Some beautiful music will make it even better. </p><br/><p>\"Well done, Xu! I knew you had potential! Get some rest now. Qin Guan, you have to continue.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Qin Guan walked over. \"Right now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! Film and rent cost a lot. You have to help me save money!\"</p><br/><p>\"Roger that!\"</p><br/><p>The camera turned to the bustling street. As soon as he had gone out of the villa, Qin Guan met his love rival. It was a man wearing glasses, who harbored a secret love for Xu.</p><br/><p>The man threatened Qin Guan nervously. \"I... I'm her boyfriend!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan leaned his head to the side and gave him a completely different smile. He looked like a bad boy now instead of an elegant student. The bad boys at school always made girls scream.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan patted the man's shoulder, \"Got it. What kind of boyfriend are you? Do you date her in your daydreams or night dreams?\"</p><br/><p>The man looked down at the ground. \"I\u2026 Both...\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\" Everyone burst into quiet laughter. The romantic film had suddenly turned into a comedy. By the time the director gestured at them to stop, the supporting actor's shirt was soaked in sweat.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't care about the difference between them. He just hugged the guy around the shoulders. \"Is this your first time on the Chinese mainland?\"</p><br/><p>The guy nodded as tamely as a quail.</p><br/><p>\"I'll be your host here!\"</p><br/><p>He suddenly shouted loudly at his assistant, \"Xiao Wang?\" Wang Liying shouted back, \"I'm here! Everything is ready!\"</p><br/><p>\"What are we waiting for then? Director Yin, Li Bingbing, Xu Ruoxuan, let's go out to dinner!\"</p><br/><p>Yin was too busy to accept the invitation. Before Xu could say anything, Li Bingbing had pulled Qin Guan away.</p><br/><p>The soul of a city was its delicious food. Qin Guan wanted to try the local food in every city he visited. Having a big dinner was actually impossible in that small ancient city. The visitors could only find specialties of the Fujian Province at street stands or small restaurants.</p><br/><p>Having noodles with gravy was their best choice. This was a traditional dish in all of Northern China, but in the Fujian Province people mixed a little soda into the flour to make the noodles rougher. This way, they were more elastic and they smelled like wheat.</p><br/><p>The gravy was a perfect mixture of ordinary ingredients.</p><br/><p>Zhangzhou Lumian soup was basically dried squid and pig bones boiled into a soup. If one added water starch, egg, shrimp and shiitake mushrooms, the Ding pork soup thickened into a paste.</p><br/><p>Some exquisite restaurants made several kinds of gravy for people with different tastes, including chicken pork soup.</p><br/><p>The cook put the noodles into an empty bowl and then poured gravy on them. The customers could choose more toppings themselves, including pig skin, pig intestines, pig lungs, shell meat, dried bamboo shoot, dried beans, and green vegetables.</p><br/><p>When the bowl was full, one could pour hot gravy into it to complete the dish.</p><br/><p>Everyone was satisfied with their dinner. One bowl of noodles seemed to be enough for Li Bingbing, but the man with the glasses looked at Qin Guan eagerly.</p><br/><p>They walked back along the quiet street leisurely, the crisp noodles cracking in their mouths. When they returned to the villa, they attracted everyone's attention. The crew suddenly found their lunch boxes boring.</p><br/><p>The actors were now a common enemy that deserved retaliation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

My parents are getting older. Plus, I love my motherland. I don't feel safe here.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you have no choice regarding your future at home, will you consider working for my firm?\"</p><br/><p>Lang got excited as he stared at the silver business card Qin Guan took out.</p><br/><p>\"Do you mean that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. You don't need to make a hasty decision. You can call me after you return to China.\"</p><br/><p>When the party ended, everyone left dreamily. On their way to Long Island, He Ming asked a question he had been burning to voice.</p><br/><p>\"Why did you offer a job to a pianist? Mainstream music is prevailing these days.\"</p><br/><p>\"Lang is not a traditional pianist. Every cell in his body is crying for fame. Plus, my underground band has been suffering because of the music piracy in China. This phenomenon has destroyed the music circle. People share music through the internet without any restrictions. Everybody can gain access to popular songs for free!\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" Although he was not in the circle, He was just as worried about this issue. Unlike the Chinese audience, the audience in Europe and America was more inclined to appreciate traditional music. There were also strict regulations and severe penalties for downloading music illegally there.</p><br/><p>Copyright laws in China hadn't caught up yet. </p><br/><p>\"Things will get better in the future. The government must set sound regulations to guide citizens. It's their duty. We shouldn't let our greedy human nature run wild.\"</p><br/><p>\"But how is this related to Lang Lang?\"</p><br/><p>\"If we can't make money from CDs, we have to turn to live performances.\"</p><br/><p>\"But you already have a band!\"</p><br/><p>\"You mean Gao Xiaosong? Those guys have big ambitions, but limited abilities. Plus, they could ruin my reputation. I earn thousands of dollars per minute. Do you know how much I make for one runway walk?\"</p><br/><p>\"How much?\"</p><br/><p>\"20,000 dollars.\"</p><br/><p>Okay, you got me. My net profit last month could only pay you for a couple of steps on the runway.</p><br/><p>\"Lang is different though. A Grammy would double his value. He was educated at famous schools, both in China and the US. He could earn one million RMB per performance. I could book the underground band along with him as a package deal. I'd gain a lot from this.\"</p><br/><p>It was late at night when they reached Qin Guan's home in Long Island.</p><br/><p>\"You can use my car until you get a new one. I'll leave it with your assistant.\"</p><br/><p>\"It would be my honor.\"</p><br/><p>\"Go away now! Bye!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt strange as he entered the house. Cong Nianwei was not there. The house had actually been empty for several years, but the cleaners came regularly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't feel any warmth radiating from it. Soon, he fell asleep with a photo of Cong Nianwei beside his pillow. In the photo, she was smiling happily at him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was woken up by the phone.</p><br/><p>\"Hello?\"</p><br/><p>\"Open the door, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, I overslept.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Liying and a stylist entered, holding equipment and breakfast in their hands.</p><br/><p>\"We'll be meeting Zhang Yimou and Zhang Weiping later in the morning. In the afternoon, we have to show up at the Walk of Fame to get your handprints and footprints...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan lay on the couch as the stylist worked on him and Wang talked. The smell of breakfast, the scent of her perfume and her voice filled the empty villa.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a long sigh of relief. Even strong men could feel lonely sometimes.</p><br/><p>He kept trying on formal suits until he found the one that felt the best. Then he turned to the breakfast.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

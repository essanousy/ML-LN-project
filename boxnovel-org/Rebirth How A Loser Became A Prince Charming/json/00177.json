Each person got a case of Xianqu biscuits, and they had to eat them in the greediest way possible in front of the director, the brand businessman and the principle of the ad company.</p><br/><p>All the candidates were moaning except for Qin Guan, who seemed to light up with pleasure.</p><br/><p>What was his best quality? Not his powerful brain or fairy-like looks, but his endless pursuit of food.</p><br/><p>The audition was as easy as breathing for him. Eating was his best skill.</p><br/><p>The interviewers were annoyed by the strange performance of the candidates.</p><br/><p>Look at that guy! It's a food advertisement! Does he think it\u2019s okay to lick the biscuits as if he\u2019s intoxicated? Next! Oh, my! This one is smacking his lips like a pig! No one warned him about that? He\u2019s even spraying pieces around! Next!</p><br/><p>Before he could get disappointed, Qin Guan walked forward leisurely, like a god descending from Heaven to save the doomed humanity.</p><br/><p>He took a biscuit from the case with his slender fingers. It did not look like a simple crisp biscuit, but a fairy feast.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stared at the lemon-filled biscuit as if it was his lover. His fingers moved, putting his lover into his mouth.</p><br/><p>His red lips opened gently, and he bit the biscuit, breaking it into two. As he was chewing, the mark of his teeth was left on the piece in his hand.</p><br/><p>Perfect! It was perfect from every angle. Whatever others might think, the brand businessman thought that the biscuits looked the best during Qin Guan's performance.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, the staff of A. M. told Qin Guan the good news.</p><br/><p>They patted Qin Guan, who was putting away his belongings, and realized he was putting audition props into his backpack. It was a pile of biscuits.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's mouth was also jammed with them. They\u2019re delicious, but they\u2019re too dry. There\u2019s no water here!</p><br/><p>The staff was startled to see all those biscuits in his mouth. Damn it! He\u2019s choking! Get some water!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone was frightened. If this had happened during the audition, Qin Guan would have definitely been thrown out.</p><br/><p>After drinking the water, he waved the staff farewell awkwardly and went out of the building.</p><br/><p>He turned on the headlights of his car. The night had fallen, and the stars were twinkling playfully. Qin Guan sighed with emotion.</p><br/><p>I have never worked this hard before. With enough pressure, even the laziest people get moving.</p><br/><p>The next day, he would act in three advertisements as an extra. He could earn 60,000 yuan in two days, which was as high as someone else\u2019s annual income.</p><br/><p>To cover the two-year postgraduate tuition fees at a US college though, plus all the living expenses, Qin Guan would have to earn at least 150,000. He dared not relax yet.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the US Dollar was very strong at the time. The terrible 1:8 rate made his future look dim.</p><br/><p>The only good news was that his outstanding auditions had attracted attention from the leaders of A. M.</p><br/><p>The Adidas and Xianqu biscuit ads would earn Qin Guan 70,000 yuan, which was a small step towards his final goal.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to dormitory. Lying in bed, he called all his acquaintances and told them about his plan.</p><br/><p>There was also a more important thing he\u2019d have to deal with soon.</p><br/><p>Do you remember his first holiday as a college student? Qin Guan had bought some stocks from his uncle's company, which had been the best choice he\u2019d made since his rebirth.</p><br/><p>Western Electricity was one of the first companies in the Chinese stock market. In 1998, it had put an end to its private sales and begun to split stock rights.</p><br/><p>The original price of two yuan had amounted to more than 280 yuan after a series of rises and falls. Finally, it had fallen down to about 5 yuan. Countless holders had made a great fortune overnight during those years.</p><br/><p>The stocks in Qin Guan's hand would soar in the following years, and no one would be prepared for it. The performance of Western Electricity had increased by 50% every year, which had shocked the stock market.</p><br/><p>Nobody but Qin Guan knew that this performance had been forged though. The company leaders had bought plenty of stocks and undersold them gradually through 44 fake individual accounts.</p><br/><p>The company had also invested 700,000,000 on the stocks through 69 fake individual accounts and cashed in most of the profits as company income.</p><br/><p>After several months, the prices would fall steeply, and countless common investors wouldn't get their original capital back.</p><br/><p>Y city citizens were hoping that the government would step forward to help them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had a general idea of the timing, so he knew that this would be his best chance to cash in his money.</p><br/><p>He called his parents to emphasize the importance of underselling the stocks and reminding his uncle.</p><br/><p>His parents had nearly forgotten about the stocks, which they\u2019d bought as a joke. They hung up and called Qin Guan's uncle, who told them their current price. Qin's parents realized they were millionaires!</p><br/><p>Luckily, they were easy to satisfy. They were really happy with the price. Qin Guan took after them after all.</p><br/><p>Both families dumped the stocks and became millionaires. They went out of the stock exchange in a daze. The sum in their account felt like a dream. Qin Guan received a call from his mother and breathed a sigh of relief at the vast sum in his account.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

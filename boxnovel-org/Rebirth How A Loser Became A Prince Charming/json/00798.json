Yes, this is Xiao Zhang. Intimate photos of you and your lady have been leaked on the internet.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Qin Guan shot a stunned look at Cong Nianwei. Thank god we have nice figures. Then he returned to the topic at hand. \"What kind of photos?\"</p><br/><p>Does this mean that our home in Xizhimen was discovered by reporters? Impossible! I'm really careful. Did they see us doing something in our room? I should have made sure the curtains were closed every time...</p><br/><p>As his imagination took flight, Wang gave him another blow. Cong Nianwei opened the door for Wang, and the girl walked into their room with a laptop. Qin Guan saw the photos on the screen.</p><br/><p>\"Take a look, Brother Qin. The photos were uploaded on your blog and the Haijiao Forum.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Let me see!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grabbed the laptop immediately. After looking carefully at the photos, he found the matter both funny and annoying.</p><br/><p>\"Are these the intimate photos you were talking about?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. They are intimate enough.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had imagined the worst, as he had experienced a nude picture scandal in his past life. At the time though, intimate photos only referred to holding hands or hugging. The circle was not that tolerant yet.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan relaxed. His expression irritated Wang.</p><br/><p>\"The Haijiao Forum is a mess. If we don't take any measures, all the headlines tomorrow will be about your affair. Everyone will find out about you and Sister Wei.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved Cong Nianwei over calmly. \"Come here, Wei. Bring me the phone.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had no idea what had happened, as she was not familiar with the circle. She sat down next to Qin Guan quietly and handed him the phone.</p><br/><p>\"I'll be loyal to you my whole life. I have actually been wanting to do something for a long time. I just wanted to fill that shelf before I did. I want to show you my sincerity. Let's announce our relationship together. Would that be alright with you?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei smiled. \"I have never hidden our relationship. I know you are a celebrity, so one day everyone would discover our connection. I wanted you to decide when that was though, as it would be important for your career.\"</p><br/><p>What a considerate girl!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan kissed her lips and lifted his phone in the air.</p><br/><p>\"Take a picture of us, Wang!\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\"</p><br/><p>Then what?</p><br/><p>\"Upload it to my blog with the caption 'my girl drops in'. Then add something romantic. I'll leave that up to you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that all? Shouldn't we talk about this with Sister Xue or Sister Qu?\"</p><br/><p>\"No need. One of them is in America, and the other is on her honeymoon. This is not a big deal.\"</p><br/><p>Wang didn't know what would be a big deal.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, everyone on the Haijiao Forum discovered the truth. Some idlers had dug up the initial gossip about Qin Guan and seen the posts from Tsinghua University.</p><br/><p>Based on the registration information, they had zeroed in on a silent account that was a frequent visitor of the comment section.</p><br/><p>After a few private messages, everyone got excited.</p><br/><p>\"Where is it? Give me the link!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a long silence prevailed.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>There was only a computer screen blinking in the dark room. The man sitting before the screen rubbed his hands excitedly and clicked on the link about Qin Guan's girlfriend.</p><br/><p>He was anxious to see evidence of Qin Guan's affair. The photos at the film base were gradually revealed, making his shoulders drop.</p><br/><p>He would never mistake the couple in the photos. It was the girl that had captured his heart and the monster that haunted his nightmares.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

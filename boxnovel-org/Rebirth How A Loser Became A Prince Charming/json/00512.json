Britney smoothed her blonde hair down and sat on Qin Guan's left without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, I\u2019ll also be cooperating with you...\"</p><br/><p>Are you flirting with the man before his girlfriend?</p><br/><p>\"We are having a hot party tonight. It\u2019s perfect for a man like you. Will you honor us with your presence?\" Paris Hilton turned his face to hers.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, Qin Guan, I know nothing about you. Shall we talk and get to know each other better?\" Britney turned his face in a different direction.</p><br/><p>They were too busy fighting over the attention of the Asian man to notice the smile on the Asian woman\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Qu smirked. Cong Nianwei noticed her murderous expression.</p><br/><p>Sandwiched between them, Qin Guan felt extremely embarrassed. The two women were staring at his face, their hands caressing his arms.</p><br/><p>The reporters went crazy at the scene. \"Bloody hell! Shall we raise funds to order a steak?\"</p><br/><p>They were too poor to enter that restaurant...</p><br/><p>Finally, Madonna resolved the dilemma.</p><br/><p>\"Girls, behave yourselves.\" She looked at her juniors kindly. \"Our actor here is flushed. Wow, you have some sauce on your mouth.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei watched in surprise as Madonna held Qin Guan's jaw with one hand, picked up a napkin from the table with the other and cleaned the sauce for him.</p><br/><p>Qu, Cong Nianwei and the other two girls were stupefied. The reporters outside went mad. What striking news! They tried their best to get closer.</p><br/><p>\"Stop! Don\u2019t push me!\"</p><br/><p>Horrified, the man in front watched the glass crack, white fissures appearing on it.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Back off! You broke the glass! Help!\"</p><br/><p> As they screamed, the glass was finally crushed. They all fell into the restaurant, rolling around on the floor. The manager was speechless.</p><br/><p>Madonna had no dignity. She had scanned Qin Guan from head to toe boldly right away.</p><br/><p>I like a good figure. Madonna actually liked to rob the cradle.</p><br/><p>The manager walked over to the reporters angrily as the chef rushed out with a sharp knife. The reporters paid no attention to them though. Countless long and short cameras were taking pictures of Qin Guan and the ladies.</p><br/><p>Flashes were twinkling. To everyone's surprise, Paris Hilton took a handsome pose before the cameras, nearly lying on top of Qin Guan's body.</p><br/><p>Madonna was sitting there elegantly, with her back to Qin Guan. She acted like nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei blinked under the lights of the cameras, speaking for the very first time.</p><br/><p>\"Let my boyfriend go!\"</p><br/><p>Her voice was not loud, but it was loud enough for Britney and Paris Hilton to hear. The two American girls finally noticed her.</p><br/><p>Wow, she is his girlfriend. We thought she was an assistant. She looks average.</p><br/><p>Britney pushed out her chest proudly, casting a meaningful look at Cong Nianwei\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>It was rude to point out someone else\u2019s disadvantage. Cong Nianwei was very irrigated by the look.</p><br/><p>\"Come here, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>Like a tame boyfriend, Qin Guan did as she told him. He rushed over to Cong Nianwei, avoiding a terrible fight.</p><br/><p>Without him in the middle, the two girls leaned naturally towards the center. Cong Nianwei threw two empty plates at them, aiming right for their breasts. Your boobs are big enough to hold them, aren\u2019t they?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made a grimace at them and smiled at Cong Nianwei. Madonna was in shock. \"Are you okay? I\u2019m sorry for my mistake. Didn\u2019t you see the two plates coming?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei stood up and pointed to her own head. \"Big boobs equal small brains. You are lacking in IQ.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sorry for our mistake,\" Qu added cleverly. \"Your clothes are stained. Linda told me that your hotel is nearby. You better go change clothes. There are so many reporters here!\"</p><br/><p>She changed the topic, for fear that the brainless girls would do something terrible. Paris and Britney nearly cried out when they saw the sauce on their breasts. They had no time to appreciate the handsome man as they covered their breasts with the tablecloth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

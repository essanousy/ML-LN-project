Compared to the ladies\u2019 collection, men's jewellery looked as poor as an orphan. Both the number of designers and types of jewellery were limited. Sets were also very rare.</p><br/><p>A set that contained four pieces was pretty uncommon, even for the fair.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, things got more exciting. Qin Guan made a fancy move with the lighter and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he unfastened his sleeve buttons.</p><br/><p>An elegant button fell on his palm. Qin Guan pinned it to the pocket on his chest along with the cardholder.</p><br/><p>He rolled up a sleeve to reveal his slender arm and the wrist watch. His wrist was as fair as a pearl, the watch strap was as black as ink, and the dial was as pure and clean as the most splendid diamond in the world.</p><br/><p>The Tiffany designers were proud to see the stupefied audience.</p><br/><p>Ha! Even professional watch brands, such as Vacheron Constantin and Omega, will look common compared to our watch! Tiffany is not a professional watch brand, after all!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around to show everyone the watch. Then he rolled his sleeve down again. Moving in time with the music, he turned back without hesitation. The jewellery lovers under the stage were still lingering around.</p><br/><p>We have not enjoyed ourselves to the fullest! Come back!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's glamor was reflected on the products on his body. He was the perfect background for the jewellery. This was the perfect collaboration between a top jewellery brand and a top model.</p><br/><p>He walked down from the stage. His first impulse was to take all the jewellery off. He couldn\u2019t afford to damage it in any way.</p><br/><p>\"Wait a moment, Qin Guan...\" Michael stopped him.</p><br/><p>\"There will be an exclusive auction for buyers later. Some other top brands of the jewellery circle will also attend it. The set on your body includes Tiffany\u2019s best pieces. Cheers!\"</p><br/><p>Michael was a little nervous. In fact, the global economy that year was really bad. Asian countries had entered an ice period. The unemployment, depression and declining economy had a big negative impact on the jewellery industry. They were hoping that Baselworld would improve things.</p><br/><p>Carrying a refined safe, Michael, Qin Guan and a female model walked through two narrow corridors, reaching a small hall that could hold 100 people. It was an independent hall set up especially for the auction and decorated to meet the demands of the buyers.</p><br/><p>There were white hollowed-out British style chairs from the 18th century and several long glass tea tables. They were for the buyers, so they could go through the brochures about the jewellery materials and concepts.</p><br/><p>The press conferences of the top brands ended one after the other, and the buyers entered the small hall in quick succession after fighting fiercely.</p><br/><p>The hall was large enough to hold them. The auction committee was strict with the invitations after all. Those with real power were few. The maximum was 100 people.</p><br/><p>The security staff informed the host that all the guests had arrived. The gate was closed slowly.</p><br/><p>\"The first item is an outstanding raw gemstone provided by the Jewellery Association. Attention, please!\"</p><br/><p>\"Large gem (more than three carats) with 10 diamond particles. The carats are respectively: three, three, three, three, four, four... The starting price is 75,000 dollars per carat... Raise your paddles, please!\"</p><br/><p>Before his voice could fade away, there was a suppressed low outcry in the hall.</p><br/><p>A calm, elegant Asian lady was competing for the diamonds against some Western and Asian rich men.</p><br/><p>\"The current price is 83,000 per carat. Anyone else?\"</p><br/><p>The men looked awkward. At such a high price, their profit would be really low. They couldn't match the offer of that crazy woman.</p><br/><p>It was not wise to compete against an insane jewellery lover. Besides, there would be other good diamonds. The other buyers gave up one after the other. The lady was content. Her friends gave her a thumbs-up. The diamonds she had won were perfect in both transparency and cut.</p><br/><p>That kind of jewellery was really rare. In a few minutes, they came to the limited editions of top-brand jewellery.</p><br/><p>\"Cartier will sell 20 golden bracelets with rubies. There are only 100 on sale all over the world.\"</p><br/><p>Most purchasers only needed two to five pieces in stock for their VIP customers. Most of the limited editions were bought by collectors.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

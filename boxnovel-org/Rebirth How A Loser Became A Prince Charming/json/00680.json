He is hitting both high and low notes. His vocal range is just...\"</p><br/><p>The short video shocked the Hong Kong singers and producers, who had had no idea about Qin Guan's singing abilities. He had always kept it a secret.</p><br/><p>When Director Chen and his company had been hesitant about choosing the protagonist of the film, these news had been their salvation. They had contacted Qin Guan's studioright away.</p><br/><p>That was how Qin Guan had gotten the part. Zhang knew nothing about this though, so he treated Qin Guan as an amateur.</p><br/><p>\"Can you recite all the songs?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you think you will be out of tune ?\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you think you might forget the lyrics while you are performing?\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\"</p><br/><p>Then why are you asking me for advice? Young people are too confident nowadays...</p><br/><p>Zhang suppressed the impulse to break Qin Guan's confidence. Instead, he planned on showing Qin Guan the reality of the situation.</p><br/><p>\"Just act out the next scene for me. Walk as you sing. You don't need to concentrate, just go through the process. If you can finish without a pause, you will be fine.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's that simple?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded and fixed his costume. He was wearing a torn windcoat and a 1920s cashmere sweater. In combination with his cap, he looked like a figure that had walkedout of a hand-painted poster of Shanghai Beach.</p><br/><p>He stood before Zhang Xueyou as if there was no one else present. Other actors and crew members were shuttling around them busily, but Director Chen had hidden behind a large box. He was observing the leading actors silently.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan took on a mysterious vibe. His eyes looked misty as his beautiful lips delivered the lyrics clearly.</p><br/><p>\"The strange expression in your eyes leaves me speechless...\"</p><br/><p>The song had been written especially for the film by a professional Hong Kong musician. The talented actors would use pop music as a way to express themselves. The peaceful tune was nothing for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He took a few steps back to stand among the busy crew. His clear voice made everyone slow down.</p><br/><p>\"This must surely mean that you are hearing me out...\"</p><br/><p>His perfect intonation made him sound like a desperate, heartbroken man.</p><br/><p>Zhang was confused. Maybe the young man was not as arrogant as he had expected after all.</p><br/><p>How can you not be an experienced opera singer? You are performing like you are on Broadway! People from the mainland are so weird!</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan finished singing, he looked at Zhang with a sincere smile, begging for more instructions. Zhang couldn't help but grimace.</p><br/><p>\"Well done! If you sing like that during the shooting, you'll be okay. Don't worry.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took off his cap excitedly. \"Great! I was afraid you'd be unsatisfied with my voice, Brother Zhang. I'm good at performing, but I suck at rehearsing.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang felt a pang in his chest as he breathed in angrily. Someone take this shameless guy away from me!</p><br/><p>Director Chen and Zhou Xue burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Zhou had just changed into her costume in the dressing room, when she witnessed the interaction between Qin Guan and Zhang Xueyou.</p><br/><p>The more powerful her opponent was, the more excited she got. She was the most talented actress among those who made a living on their looks. She led a free, romantic lifeand exerted all her energy on love. She never lingered long on one lover.</p><br/><p>She was not ashamed by the number of her lovers, nor did she try to keep a man around when the passion faded away. Like most butterflies, she always flew to the most beautiful flower.</p><br/><p>As a result, she often had affairs with male co-stars and other crew members. Sister Xue was aware of that, so she had been keeping an eye on her from the very beginning.The expression in Zhou's eyes made her wary.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan is doomed. She has set her eyes on him!</p><br/><p>All emotions started from that kind of special attention. A figure began lingering in one's eyes and heart, the feeling fermenting slowly until it spouted out.</p><br/><p>Please spare Qin Guan, Princess Zhou! He might look clever and romantic, but he is a lovesick idiot. A master of love like you could kill him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xue smiled, golden paillettes glittering on her body. Her soft, hoarse voice melted everyone's hearts.</p><br/><p>\"I'm ready, Director Chen. I feel great.\"</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhou was itching to act. Qin Guan's performance had inspired her passion as an actress.</p><br/><p>A good partner was also a good opponent. No matter their gender.</p><br/><p>Chen Kexin rubbed his hands together excitedly and rushed to the main camera, gesturing that they were all set.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

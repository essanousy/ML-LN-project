Their designs had to match the internet facilities perfectly to create a brand new modern, high-tech community.</p><br/><p>The final winner would be the team who made the most practical design at the lowest cost. It seemed like a typical competition, but it was actually a chance for the newly rich to share ideas and technologies with each other and show off about their fortunes in the process.</p><br/><p>The award was very alluring for the young architects. The tutors at Columbia stressed the importance of practice and encouraged their students to participate in such competitions.</p><br/><p>The team was composed by Cong Nianwei, Rongzhi and some other students. Thanks to Cong Nianwei's business qualification certificate, they overcame all difficulties on their way to their destination. The final competition would be held in Las Vegas.</p><br/><p>Las Vegas was the holy land of wealth and gambling. Many people were fascinated by the city's charm. It was an oasis in the desert, and most towns around it lived on the tourists attracted by the casinos.</p><br/><p>The boring tycoons had found a small town in that area that fit their plan. Meanwhile, Chris had decided to hold a grand performance before visitors from all over the world.</p><br/><p>The weather in late October was great in Las Vegas, as the city enjoyed an inland desert climate. Tourists from all directions went there to have an extraordinary time.</p><br/><p>The small casinos had initially attracted the cowboys before growing into a world-famous industry. Billionaires in search of an opportunity went there to get a share of the profits. Japanese tycoons, Arabian princesses and Hollywood stars invested in the industry one after the other, thus helping along the development of tourism and entertainment in the surrounding area.</p><br/><p>As a result, Las Vegas had become a truly sleepless city.</p><br/><p>The Blue Man Group Theater, which could hold thousands of people, was located in the center of the city and had the most luxurious lighting and sound equipment. Only a theater like that could meet Chris' demands.</p><br/><p>A professional model had to be responsible and reliable, so Qin Guan went to the theater, where Chris was waiting for him for the rehearsal.</p><br/><p>He stood on the stage for a long time as the crew worked around him. Nobody came over to check on him. Aren't they afraid I'll screw everything up tomorrow?</p><br/><p>Confused, Qin Guan walked over to Chris, who looked like a zombie.</p><br/><p>\"What do I have to do? When will the rehearsal begin?\"</p><br/><p>Chris shot a strange look at him.</p><br/><p>\"You don't have to rehearse. Just come here one hour early tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know nothing about floating. Shall we try...\"</p><br/><p>\"No point. I'm in charge of the performance. All you have to do is float.\"</p><br/><p>You are such a good professional. Don't blame me if I screw up tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The innocent young man left the theater and headed back to his hotel. He still had some spare time, but the dry wind made his heart itchy. Cong Nianwei was still in that small town. Qin Guan heard his money cry in his pocket.</p><br/><p>He took a small turn and joined a group of excited tourists that was heading to a luxurious casino named SLOTS.</p><br/><p>What an arrogant name. I like it!</p><br/><p>Actually, this was the first time Qin Guan was entering a real casino, but he had used to play such games at school, so it would be easy for him to learn the rules.</p><br/><p>Despite his self-consciousness, he decided that he would be a good student.</p><br/><p>There were only a few options in the casino. The most popular one was the slots, the toughest test of luck was the roulette, and the game that required the most skill was Black Jack. Qin Guan even saw some mahjong tables in a corner of the hall, designed to meet the demands of the Asian visitors.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan, who was a typical penny pincher, chose the slots. He stood and watched some other visitors play with relish.</p><br/><p>Most of the guests were there for the casinos, and the slots were the best choice for a man with a strict wife, as they cost only 0.01 dollar per round.</p><br/><p>After watching a few machines, Qin Guan understood how the slots worked. The rate of return had to be adjustable, but it was set to 90%.</p><br/><p>This meant that if one spent one dollar to play 100 times, they would have 0.9 dollars left. Of course, those lucky dogs that won big were not included.</p><br/><p>As a rich guy, Qin Guan had to make a big bet. His status called for it, so he decided to bet 0.2 dollars.</p><br/><p>He threw one dollar into the slot. He could play for a long while with it. As he sat before a machine happily, a strong man next to him looked at his bare hands in disdain. He must be a poor guy. He will just gamble away all his money and leave soon.</p><br/><p>Dear everyone, here is the new book of Kiki, my lovely editors.

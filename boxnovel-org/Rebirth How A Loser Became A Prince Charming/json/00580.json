As he heard the background sounds, he started to miss Cong Nianwei so much that he teared up.</p><br/><p>Some people were gifted, or they tried to seem impressive. Qin Guan had to relieve himself in the business class washroom. When the plane began to descend, Chris went out looking satisfied.</p><br/><p>\"I love american airlines! Don't forget your promise, Qin Guan. See you in Las Vegas!\"</p><br/><p>Matta's black lace panties were still in Chris' pocket, but he had already switched to business mode. Matta went out looking normal, but the money in her hand betrayed the nature of their deal.</p><br/><p>\"Are you crazy? You paid her?\"</p><br/><p>\"All adults do. It's normal, dude!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless. The trend of sexual liberation would also reach China in the future, but this had been unheard of even at ancient Chinese whorehouses. Back then, people would be thrown into a river for committing such a sin.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got off the plane with his luggage as fast as he could. Chris was unable to catch up with him.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had occupied his mind. The two of them hugged each other at the terminal and then escaped from the keen reporters chasing them. The reporters abandoned the chase when Chris went out.</p><br/><p>\"Chris, tell us about your popular tour in Europe!\"</p><br/><p>\"Chris, what are your plans for the next six months?\"</p><br/><p>\"Chris, we just saw Qin Guan. Did you two collaborate in Europe?\"</p><br/><p>They all stretched their microphones out towards Chris. The popular magician threw a figurative bomb at them.</p><br/><p>\"We were on the same plane. The two of us became good friends during our short journey. I invited him to join me on my tour across America as my special guest. All our fans will be very lucky!\"</p><br/><p>\"Scream, everyone! Go crazy! Chris' magic month is waiting for you!\"</p><br/><p>He stuck his tongue out, shaking his piercing. The reporters were over the moon. Due to the dangerous nature of his performance, no celebrity usually dared to join him on such an adventure.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had accepted his invitation? This was big news!</p><br/><p>Ignoring his vague words, everyone began to celebrate in advance.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that he had been trapped. He was currently in the land of warmth and tenderness.</p><br/><p>There was an array of faithful soldiers on guard on the window sill. Next to them, a pretty ballet dancer was radiating love and tenderness through her eyes as she looked at the one-legged tin soldier.</p><br/><p>A hairy bear had been carefully placed on the headboard. The bedside lamp had been turned off, and the lovers were sleeping amid the lingering fragrance of roses.</p><br/><p>There was some simple Chinese food on the table. It was a beautiful, peaceful time. Where one's love was, that was where their home was as well.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Love was the best incentive. Qin Guan showed up on campus again holding a large bag and Cong Nianwei's drawing board. He was a good man through and through.</p><br/><p>It would have been the perfect morning if it weren't for the terrible news Xu Xiaoxiao shared with him.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, you were so brave to accept Chris Angel's invitation! Good luck being his special guest!\"</p><br/><p>Xu was waving a newspaper at him as he stood by the entrance of the classroom.</p><br/><p>\"I read it in the newspaper! He said that you two were good friends. Is he lying? I like him though. He is so rebellious!\"</p><br/><p>\"You have been very popular lately, Qin Guan! Tell me what happened with the three celebrities! Does Britney have big boobs?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan cast a supercilious look at him. He didn't want to speak with Xu. The guy was drooling over his romantic affairs. Qin Guan took out his new timetable.</p><br/><p>Xu didn't know that they wouldn't be sharing many classes in the future. Postgraduate students were always lonely.</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin entered the classroom with a pleasant smile. He was delighted to see his good student back on the right track.</p><br/><p>From that day on, Qin Guan would return to his normal life.</p><br/><p>There was a bustling lunch party taking place on the lawn. People gathered around Qin Guan, many of them new friends. His classmates greeted him as they walked by.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Qin Guan! How are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your film was good. Got any new plans?\"</p><br/><p>Disharmonious voices were heard everywhere.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Qin Guan, over here!\"</p><br/><p>Paris Hilton waved at Qin Guan from afar. Qin Guan picked up his backpack helplessly.</p><br/><p>\"We'll do something on the weekend!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

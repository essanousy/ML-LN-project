I\u2019m familiar with the prices at the time.</p><br/><p>The tricycle dashed forward on the unsurfaced road, leaving a yellow smoke behind.</p><br/><p>When he arrived, Qin Guan understood why Sister Xue had not answered his call. The place was quite far from the centre of city, with no direct bus line. Half the site of the market was still under construction.</p><br/><p>The man hosting the car exhibition had bought a bunch of new cars and organized the event to promote himself.</p><br/><p>The market was also supporting his effort, because the place was indeed remote for residents of the capital.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not remember the place himself until he had reached his destination. When it was completed, the Siyuanqiao Market for Automobile Accessories would become one of the largest markets for automobile accessories in Beijing. At 26,000 square meters, the market would contain more than 500 powerful business units.</p><br/><p>The owner of Manyoufu Garage was quite a cunning man.</p><br/><p>After changing clothes in the office, Qin Guan was appointed by the staff to a white Jetta car.</p><br/><p>Wearing a black waistcoat, a white shirt, pants and bow tie, Qin Guan looked like a waiter in a western restaurant.</p><br/><p>The assistant of the garage thanked him for his understanding. The suit had been borrowed by his wife from a hotel.</p><br/><p>The exhibition was outdoors, and a poster of the garage was hanging in the back. Two Jettas, three Santanas and a Skoda were being exhibited. These were the most popular car types in 1999 in the capital.</p><br/><p>There was a model standing next to each of the six cars. They all had young, rustic faces and took complicated poses as they stood by their appointed car with pride.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue covered her face. I can't believe I picked such a job for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Although right now he is just an untrained model, he is a beloved student of Professor Li and the only model I work for. With such an outstanding figure and appearance, he can\u2019t be seen with such low-level models. Sister Xue felt sick as her imagination ran wild.</p><br/><p>She picked up her bag and waved Qin Guan over, \u201cWe can't stay here. It was a mistake. These models are too low-level to be seen with you,\u201d she said urgently.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stopped her as she was about to leave. He smiled and said, \u201cYou have taught me that, no matter the situation, a good model should always withstand the pressure and finish his designed work, as set by the employer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re thinking for me, but I think this is nothing. The cars are pretty good. Although they\u2019re family cars, they\u2019re good quality. If the products are good, that\u2019s enough for me. Just don't ask me to promote anything outrageous.\u201d</p><br/><p>He made a comforting gesture at Sister Xue and returned to his car to wait for the opening ceremony.</p><br/><p>Except for Qin Guan, who had been introduced by his independent agent, all the other models had come from the same small agency.</p><br/><p>The owner of Manyoufu Garage had selected them for their low price.</p><br/><p>The difference between the models was 1,500 yuan versus 200 yuan.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had mixed feelings, but the bald owner recognized Qin Guan at first glance. He\u2019s definitely worth the money. The owner called his assistant over and murmured something to him.</p><br/><p>The assistant nodded, ran to the Skoda, and said something to the model standing there before he pulled him to Qin Guan\u2019s car.</p><br/><p>Pointing at the champagne-colored Skoda, he told Qin Guan, \u201cMy boss thinks it\u2019s more suitable for you. There, the champagne one. You can be in charge of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded in agreement before he went to stand by the car. The owner was quite pleased with the effect.</p><br/><p>He was indeed a noble-looking young man. His colouring looked very attractive among the red, white and black cars.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, not long after the exhibition had opened, customers in the market discovered it, undoubtedly attracted by Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>They had seen what looked like a top show model leaning against a strange champagne-colored car. The brand of the car was also new to them. Skoda was a newcomer to the capital.</p><br/><p>They gathered around to look at the car, asking the price and applying for a test drive. Qin Guan\u2019s salesmen were the busiest. The other salesmen were so envious, they wished Qin Guan was their model.</p><br/><p>The boss was really happy with the result. He touched his bald head as he thought, What did the Skoda agency say exactly? How much will they pay me for one order? My head has not been working so well after I went bald.</p><br/><p>After standing there the whole morning, Qin Guan\u2019s leg began to cramp.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t rest while I\u2019m surrounded by an audience. My cheeks are stiff from smiling. Making money is hard.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was massaging his shanks. She was a professional masseuse, able to relieve any tense muscles. Sister Xue had been quite busy those days. She had gotten a certificate in professional health care.</p><br/><p>Lunch had been prepared in a large canteen cauldron. It was the garage\u2019s treat. There wasn't a lunch box nearby, but the assistant had bought dishes from the small restaurant at the entrance of the market.</p><br/><p>One box of rice for each person. They also used foam plastic boxes.</p><br/><p>The models sat in a circle as the assistant opened the boxes one by one.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan poked his head in to find that the dishes were quite good. There were mushrooms fried with oilseed, double-cooked pork slices, diced chicken with bean sauce, fish-flavoured pork slices, minced meat with vermicelli, homemade bean curd, and vinegar-pepper soup. A six dish combo with soup was quite a good meal.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shifted to eating mode while the other models, their agent, and Sister Xue looked on.</p><br/><p>He was just like a Nanfu battery, six times more powerful than the others. He looked like a little hog eating happily in front of its crib.</p><br/><p>The other models were astonished. Despite the fact that they were not professional models, they still watched their figure.</p><br/><p>They might not have a specific diet, but gormandizing was definitely out of the question.</p><br/><p>Their agent looked confused. Sister Xue smiled at them awkwardly before she buried her head inside a box.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the exhibition took on a weird atmosphere. The other models were looking at Qin Guan reverently. Qin Guan had no idea why. He thought this was the weariest job he had done so far.</p><br/><p>He had to pay attention to how he looked because of the passing customers.</p><br/><p>Several female customers looked at him wantonly, making him feel threatened. He felt like a small, helpless pig ready for slaughter.</p><br/><p>Feeling sick, Qin Guan took a break from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., when most customers had left the remote location of the market.</p><br/><p>The owner of the garage waved to the two agents in satisfaction. The exhibition could be wrapped up now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

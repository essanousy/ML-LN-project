Jiang Wen had tried his best to get the actor there. Strictly speaking, the man was not actually an actor, but a singer.</p><br/><p>It was Cui Jian, the old god of rock music.</p><br/><p>He had joined the crew as a guest star who would be playing a friend of Jiang Wen's who lived in Beijing.</p><br/><p>He was a real friend, so he tried to persuade Jian Wen, who was a very hot-headed guy. He had researched the boy's background and reached the conclusion that Qin Guan was not the real reason behind Kong's betrayal.</p><br/><p>She had just been lonely.</p><br/><p>Convinced, Jiang Wen returned to the village and met Qin Guan again. The young man was determined to die though. As soon as he spread the velvet banner, he said, \"Your wife's stomach is not like velvet at all.\"</p><br/><p>Those were his last words.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Thus, Qin Guan was killed just before the end of the film. Although he got a bonus again, he thought that his character had been courting death too hard. He repeatedly emphasized this to Jiang Wen.</p><br/><p>No man could bear that, even if they were simple, kind and honest.</p><br/><p>In Jiang's opinion, Qin Guan represented a group of bold, reckless and stupid people of the time.</p><br/><p>On their way back, the crew made a small detour to Shangri-La to take a look. It was said that Chen had finished his job and left. Jiang Wen was a perfectionist though, so he wanted to re-shoot some scenes there.</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked by the Flowers Ocean.</p><br/><p>The flowers there had not been planted by humans to promote tourism. The place was a marvellous natural spectacle that had suffered through wind, rain, frost and intense heat. Different kinds of flowers were blooming silently on the high land.</p><br/><p>If it wasn't for the development of tourism in the Yunnan Province, they would have lived there year after year and showed everyone their power and thirst for life.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, humans had found the place. When the crew of \"The Promise\" had arrived, they had proclaimed that they wanted to show the audience the beautiful view.</p><br/><p>The wild flowers hadn't satisfied them though, so they had pulled out plenty of flowers and vines and left only the most beautiful and elegant flowers. They thought that people would like that.</p><br/><p>Thus, they had put all the \"noblest\" flowers together to create a man-made garden. It was a really beautiful view, except that there was an ugly bare land behind it.</p><br/><p>Butterflies and bees were lingering around, looking for honey, but the elegant flowers drove them away.</p><br/><p>The place was a miserable mess. Everyone was feeling bitter hatred. It would take the ocean of flowers dozens of years to revert back to its original state.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the angry crew saw something strange on the hillside. They exchanged a glance and put on big masks.</p><br/><p>On the bank of the beautiful Tianchi, a local administrator was pulling at an outlander.</p><br/><p>\"Tell me what happened! Stop!\" The man had gotten really angry with a member of the crew.</p><br/><p>Actually, the crew member was just the man in charge of carrying the equipment and props.</p><br/><p>He looked helpless as he tried to explain to the angry man.</p><br/><p>\"I'm just a member of the crew, I don't make any decisions here. This is none of my business!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and his companions shot him a look and gasped.</p><br/><p>Tianchi was a pond on high land, which was typically a rare sight. The water of the pond was transparent and crystal, as it was created from melting snow and it contained local minerals.</p><br/><p>The pond had changed a lot though. Its naturally round bank had been destroyed, but the worse part was that the crew had built a floating bridge made of cement, stone pillars and wood along the bank.</p><br/><p>That setting would appear in the film for just a few minutes, but the mysterious pond of the local legends would stay a muddy pond forever.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

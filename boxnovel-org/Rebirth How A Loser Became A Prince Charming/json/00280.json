Domestic media were voting for him voluntarily.</p><br/><p>The brand businessman who had a contract with him was shameless. He told his staff to vote online every day, and the workers of his plants voted from internet cafes nearby. They would get a bonus from their superiors for the votes.</p><br/><p>The whole process was like gathering sand to build a tower.</p><br/><p>All the actors and staff in the entertainment circle who knew the boy voted for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was finally feeling confident. On the last afternoon of the vote, Qin Guan replaced Shao Xiaobing at first place. He was sitting on the throne steadily thanks to the power of China.</p><br/><p>Fang sighed in the Cartier offices. The blinking stars in the sky reminded her of that night again. Will that guy regret his choice?</p><br/><p>Fang didn't care about the trick her ex-lover had played. Her affairs were always well-known in Singapore. It was a pity that Shao hadn\u2019t won despite her sacrifice. What would he do when his contract with Cartier expired?</p><br/><p>At midnight, the vote count stopped. The next day, the technical staff would deliver the results to the committee. The competition for the most sought-after title in Asia had come to an end. The award ceremony would be held in the spring. The seniors members of the Asian Model Association would present the prize to the lucky guy.</p><br/><p>After working all night, Shao looked withered and gloomy. There was stubble growing on his jaw.</p><br/><p>His eyes looked tired and desperate. Without the title or Fang Meiya\u2019s support, he was facing a long, rugged way abroad.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entrusted Sister Xue to deal with all his affairs. Meanwhile, he was preparing with Cong Nianwei for going abroad.</p><br/><p>The two families would spend the Spring Festival together to talk about their kids.</p><br/><p>The young couple had been neglecting their parents ever since they\u2019d fallen in love. Their parents\u2019 opinion changed when they heard the unexpected news.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s parents were glad, but Cong Nianwei\u2019s father fell into deep thought.</p><br/><p>I should pay attention to you if you return home with my daughter! </p><br/><p>Everyone was polite when they had their first dinner together. Cong Nianwei's mother, a docile woman, was looking at her husband with concern.</p><br/><p>They ate and talked.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, our Weiwei will go abroad to study. What are your future plans?\"</p><br/><p>Stunned, Qin Guan glanced at Cong Nianwei, who looked down guiltily. My father didn't want to hear about you.</p><br/><p>Without any help from her, Qin Guan had to step onto that minefield alone.</p><br/><p>\"I applied to the same university and got an acceptance notice from my tutor, sir.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's father choked. Qin Guan's father added another stab. \"Our Qin Guan got full marks in his TOEFL exam.\"</p><br/><p>He is even better than my daughter! The man\u2019s pride was swept away.</p><br/><p>He is both handsome and a perfect student! Unbelievable!</p><br/><p>\"Your main task is to study. I hope you can look after each other in the US. We can discuss the details on your return.\"</p><br/><p>He was planning on following a delaying strategy. Nobody could make a promise on emotion.</p><br/><p>Smiling, Qin Guan expressed his loyalty to Cong Nianwei's father. \"Don\u2019t worry, sir. My friend in the US has found a house for us. I will make money, cook and do the housework. Cong Nianwei will be safe in the US with me.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? You\u2019ll live together in the US?\" Cong Nianwei\u2019s father asked with trembling lips.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan answered without hesitation, \"Yes, we live together in Beijing...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw Cong Nianwei looking at him behind his father's back. Cong Nianwei's mother, who knew about the situation, looked worried.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re living together?\" Cong Nianwei's father stared at Qin Guan fiercely, as if he was looking at the enemy.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Hold him!\" Cong Nianwei, who knew her father, realized that he had reached his breaking point. They began pulling and pushing each other.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s father joined the fight with a smile.</p><br/><p>Well done, son!</p><br/><p>After a while, Cong Nianwei\u2019s father calmed down and sat back. Then everyone became serious.</p><br/><p>As they left the restaurant, Qin Guan\u2019s father secretly gave Qin Guan the thumbs up. \"You take after me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned his gaze to his mother, who was saying goodbye to Cong Nianwei's mother, and shrugged. He thought very highly of his father.</p><br/><p>When they returned home, Cong Nianwei ignored her angry father, who was sitting on the couch silently. As she was cleaning the room with her mother, her father asked her angrily, \"So you\u2019ve made your decision?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Think it over. You\u2019re young.\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

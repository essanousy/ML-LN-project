A design company isn't as easy to manage as that guy thinks. Qian Wangcai stood up with sparkling eyes and followed them closely.</p><br/><p>\"Master Cong, would you join my company?\"</p><br/><p>\"Engineer Cong, do you have any work for our company?\"</p><br/><p>\"Boss Cong, do you need any sponsors?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a supercilious look at him. My admirer seems to have changed his mind. Does he have another idol now?</p><br/><p>The car drove away, leaving a smiling Qian Wangcai behind, holding a business card.</p><br/><p>Busy days flew by fast. \"America\u2019s Next Top Model\" would air on the weekend. The evening the program was about to air, Qin Guan didn't wait before the TV. Instead, he was sitting in Qu's office with a serious expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his upgraded level, he had the chance to get some sponsors and film offers. Scripts were accumulating on Qu's desk. Most of them were for commercial films with a limited budget. There were a lot of choices for Qin Guan though.</p><br/><p>After selecting, Qu gave him the best scripts. They were all produced or distributed by reliable companies. Qin Guan read the titles one by one.</p><br/><p>\"50 First Dates\". A romantic movie.</p><br/><p>\"Mean Girls\". A teen film.</p><br/><p>\"Eating Out\". LGBTQ.</p><br/><p>\"Hot Dance\". A musical.</p><br/><p>On the whole, Qu had collected films with a small budget. Before Qin Guan could make a decision, Qu\u2019s phone rang. She pressed the handsfree button.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Editor, Director Luchant is here for your appointment.\" It was her assistant.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan glanced at Qu doubtfully. \"Let them in,\" she answered calmly.</p><br/><p>Then she smiled at Qin Guan. \"Everyone is here.\"</p><br/><p>Is he the director in charge of the Armani advertisement? Sister, could you please inform me in advance?</p><br/><p>No, because the director had just arrived in America that day. As soon as he\u2019d returned, he had contacted Qin Guan's agent to talk about the shooting schedule.</p><br/><p>Qu had agreed happily. The contract would also be signed that day.</p><br/><p>The director opened his arms warmly.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my boy! It\u2019s nice to see you again. We have cooperated before!\"</p><br/><p>Qu asked everyone to take a seat before she talked to Qin Guan about Luchant\u2019s vision.</p><br/><p>\"Do you remember your cooperation on the Armani advertisement? Back then, he had secretly promised that you would be the leading actor. As a sincere creative director, he kept his promise. Enlightened by you, he returned to France and wrote the first draft with the help of an award-winning scriptwriter. Then, along with other directors sharing common ground with him, he decided about the final script and the shooting plan.\"</p><br/><p>\"The name of the movie is \u2018Lost Embrace\u2019. He returned to America for this. You should accept the film.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt a warm stream in his heart. After receiving such acknowledgment from a director, he could die happy.</p><br/><p>Luchant\u2019s following introduction satisfied him. Regardless of all the details, Qin Guan thought this opportunity was very rare.</p><br/><p>This was a film jointly directed by directors from different countries, including Argentina, France, Italy and Spain. It was an indie film aiming for awards. All European countries pursuing film perfection were basically involved. The box office would be an insult to them.</p><br/><p>Of course, Qin Guan would not accept a paycheck of 20 dollars an hour. He was the Best Actor Cannes Award winner after all.</p><br/><p>Luchant was generous enough to pay Qu 50,000 dollars, which shocked her. That was a really big sacrifice for art.</p><br/><p>Thinking of Qin Guan's level as an actor, Qu sighed helplessly. This was far from the modelling circle.</p><br/><p>The two parties discussed all the details. Qu stuffed all the scripts into Qin Guan's backpack, except for \"Eating Out\". They all required repeated auditions. The producers were casting a larger net to catch more fish.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned home, but did not find Cong Nianwei there. There was only a food container lying quietly in the fridge. The Yeung Chou fried shrimp rice, cucumbers, carrots and peas were awaiting their destiny. Warmth was lingering in Qin Guan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\"Oops!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put down his Coca-Cola with a burp. Their term exams were finished, so Cong Nianwei was focused on their gallery now.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled knowingly as he thought of her butt under the light. He took all the scripts out of the bag.</p><br/><p>As Qu had expected, he read \"Lost Embrace\" first. It was an everyday life story full of warmth and sentiment. He was absorbed into the story, tears shining in his eyes, when suddenly the doorbell rang.</p><br/><p>\"Who's there?\" Qin Guan put on his slippers and opened the door. The Batiste brothers couldn't wait to squeeze in.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, we heard that you\u2019ll be the leading actor in our tutor's new film!\"</p><br/><p>\"You have to accept the job!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

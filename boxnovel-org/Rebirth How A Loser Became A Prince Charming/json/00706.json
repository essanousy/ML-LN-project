Meanwhile, his prey, Qin Guan, received a confusing call from Sister Qu.</p><br/><p>\"What are you talking about, Sister? The Teen Choice Awards? What the hell is that?\"</p><br/><p>His question made Qu feel awkward, but she still tried to explain to him about the children's awards and their difference from traditional ones.</p><br/><p>The Teen Choice Awards were a new event organized by FOX that had started only a few years earlier, but it was very famous among American teenagers. 80% of them knew about the awards, and many of them had voted online at least once.</p><br/><p>The most important part of the awards was the grand ceremony, which was like a meet-and-greet with superstars. The group of idols that attended the ceremony made the teenagers go crazy.</p><br/><p>FOX TV broadcasted the event live all over the world, so the producer of \"Mean Girls\" had sent the film to the organizing committee without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had won not one, but three awards at the 6th Teen Choice Awards, including the Best Actor and Best Screen Partner Award. All the titles sounded very cool.</p><br/><p>This was great news for him. He had won three awards with one stone! Naturally, Qin Guan decided to attend the ceremony.</p><br/><p>The event would be held soon, so Qin Guan had to start preparing immediately. Even Qu was in awe of his good luck. He won awards for every film he shot.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, her phone rang again.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, this is Qu Xuemei. Who is this? Okay, in the second week of August... No problem... I'll ask him to read the script first. I'll call you back later.\"</p><br/><p>Finally, a decent job!</p><br/><p>The Teen Choice Awards turned out to be better than Qu had expected. Qin Guan's starting point in Europe had still been a little higher though. The difference between the two was like the one between the Himalaya Mountains and the Mariana Islands.</p><br/><p> The attendants didn't even need to dress formally during the ceremony, but a lot of Qin Guan's fans made their presence known.</p><br/><p>The Columbia network technology team had hacked into FOX's ticketing system and bought a few more admission tickets. They were not greedy though. Qin Guan's fans only took up half of the seats in the splendid hall. The venue was full of flashlights, light sticks and banners.</p><br/><p>His fans were actually honest. If they weren't, they would have let fans of other stars in on their secret knowledge.</p><br/><p>The host on the stage was calm, but the audience was very nervous. They could see that half of the seats were occupied by fans of a certain star. Qin Guan's fans were all wearing uniforms and holding up banners and all kinds of strange tools. There were also some fascinating guys wearing sparkling helmets with LED lights.</p><br/><p> They were certainly very ambitious.</p><br/><p>Before the ceremony could begin, some fans, who obviously wanted to watch the world burn, started shouting under the stage.</p><br/><p>\"Britney! I love you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Paris! I love you!\"</p><br/><p>The abominable fans began to whistle. Yes, the hostess was Paris Hilton, and the winner of the Best MV Award was Britney.</p><br/><p>How embarrassing!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea what his fans were doing. He was busy looking at a group of teenage idols backstage. The young stars were all the same age or even younger than him, but they treated him like a senior citizen.</p><br/><p>JoJo, who was the youngest one among them, was only 14 years old. She and Ashley Simpson were hiding behind punk rock band Blink-182. The three musicians, who were fully dressed for the ceremony, were looking at Qin Guan jealously from a small corner.</p><br/><p>The territories of the two groups were as different as the first and tenth WOW level.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

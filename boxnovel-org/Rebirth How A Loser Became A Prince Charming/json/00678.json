The prop master signalled at Chen Kexin and the first scene began.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, please! Three, two, action!\"</p><br/><p>The driver started the car as the cameraman zoomed in on Qin Guan's face. Qin Guan was leaning against the backseat, his big sunglasses shielding his eyes so only his sexy stubbled jaw and straight nose were visible.</p><br/><p>He was tired after his long trip, so he leaned silently against the door and took a nap as he listened to his chatty agent.</p><br/><p>\"No kissing. No nudity. No erotic scenes\u2026\" Wu Junru told him. Sister Xue, who was talking to an assistant excitedly, had said the same. Wu was speaking Cantonese though, while Sister Xue spoke Mandarin. Both of them were very serious.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's character was pretty tame, but Sister Xue was still adamant.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan woke up with a start, as if from a nightmare. Wu considerately handed him a cigarette.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had never smoked, so he felt like coughing awkwardly. He had been a chain smoker in his past life though, so he was somewhat familiar with the smoke.</p><br/><p>While Sister Xue was busy worrying about the scene, she suddenly saw Qin Guan smoke slowly, as if he had done this a hundred times before. The white cigarette looked really sexy between his lips.</p><br/><p>When he lowered his head to light it up, the rising smoke covered his face, making him look very mysterious.</p><br/><p>\"I wonder why you agreed to that film. There's no profit for you, the budget is small, and it will interfere with your original work\u2026\" Wu Junru murmured. She looked just like Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>When the car passed by a shopping mall, Zhou Xun's poster came into view. She looked very attractive to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Never fall in love with the heroine,\" the kind agent warned Qin Guan. \"They will not return your feelings. You are of no help to them. Their aim is always the director.\"</p><br/><p>Ms. Sun was played by Zhou Xun, who was a famous actress in China.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fell silent. He looked expressionlessly out of the window, lost in his memories. The background faded gradually into darkness.</p><br/><p>Satisfied, the cameraman turned off the camera.</p><br/><p>A conscientious policeman was lingering around on his motorbike.</p><br/><p> They are all troublemakers. Why did they choose this busy street as their shooting site? Who are the people inside the car? Why did the highway agency cooperate with them?</p><br/><p> Because the temporary police offices and the motorcycle he was riding had been donated by the crew. They had to tolerate them to reap those benefits.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The crew was actually very quick. After the first scene, everyone had gotten to know each other well, so they were able to finish fast.</p><br/><p>A production assistant saluted the policeman and rushed back to the car with the last stool.</p><br/><p> Shanghai is a nice place. Even the policemen here are handsome.</p><br/><p>In an effort to save time, Qin Guan and Wu Junru didn't get off the car. They just headed to their next stop right away.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Sister Junru. This is our first cooperation. I'm Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>The careless woman took his hand.</p><br/><p>\"I'm finally meeting you in person! You are much more handsome than you look in photos. Look at your hands! You could make a living on them alone!\"</p><br/><p>The straightforward woman was renowned for her good temper. She became good friends with anyone that she liked. Qin Guan was obviously her kind of person. She spent all their leftover time complimenting him.</p><br/><p> Her eyes were fixed on him as they made their way to the old hotel. If Sister Xue hadn't pulled Qin Guan into a dressing room, the actress might have killed him with her eyes.</p><br/><p>The dressing room was in good condition. The hotel had many rooms, but this one featured a redwood European vanity mirror. A dresser stood right behind Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>He and the other two stars enjoyed the same accommodation. Qin Guan was satisfied, as he didn't want to be treated differently. They were shooting a musical that combined both commercial and indie elements, so the clever Hong Kong producers had managed to get investment through all possible channels.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

One of the hosts stretched her hand out towards Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"I apologize for our mistake.\"</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan stood up, he found himself standing among the colorful mascots. It was so ridiculous that he burst into laughter again, which made the others laugh as well.</p><br/><p>The director couldn't stand this anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, guys! I suggest we finish shooting the film first. Then, you'll have plenty of time to laugh.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. Sorry, director!\"</p><br/><p>\"Put on your masks. You are all experienced actors. You shouldn't need my guidance!\"</p><br/><p>The five Fuwa got into their positions.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, please. The Olympic mascot advertisement begins in three, two\u2026 Camera!\"</p><br/><p>The five Fuwa gathered around Qin Guan and started jumping and waving their hands. Qin Guan showed his respect by cupping one hand in the other in front of his chest.</p><br/><p>\"The Olympics are here. Please follow the mascots and join us!\"</p><br/><p>Did anyone want to join the fun?</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, the shooting ended with a frame of the five mascots clustering around Qin Guan. Then, the cameraman took a few more photos for the posters.</p><br/><p>It was an easy, smooth start for Qin Guan's career in 2008.</p><br/><p>2008 was a lucky year for him. His films were discussed everywhere online.</p><br/><p>\"I cried when I watched 'I Am Legend'. This was the first time I cried during a sci-fi film.\"</p><br/><p>\"You must be really emotional, my friend. I admit that Qin Guan gave a good performance both mentally and physically, but I have to say that you are too sensitive.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that's right. I wonder why the Oscar committee is still ignoring Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"He has showed up on the red carpet plenty of times.\"</p><br/><p>\"But he never won an award. It's different, dude.\"</p><br/><p>\"These are American awards. No foreigner has ever won the Best Actor Award.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Best Supporting Actor Award is fair game. Qin Guan just needs a chance!\"</p><br/><p>\"By the way, are there any news updates on his website?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. 2008 is an important year for all Chinese people. Qin Guan can't lazy around on the job.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Speak of the devil! His blog was just updated!\"</p><br/><p>\"What happened?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's a post about the Olympics.\"</p><br/><p>The organizing committee had taken advantage of Qin Guan's film to release its promotional spot, which would air on more than 300 TV stations around the world before the Olympics.</p><br/><p>This was the first time China's culture and history would be displayed globally in such a simple, easy way. The short film was not enough to show the country's charm entirely, but it was enough to impress the audience.</p><br/><p>The director tentatively combined pictures of pandas with Qin Guan by using an editing program. The cute, naive pandas were enjoying their meal in a green bamboo forest. Suddenly, the camera jumped to Qin Guan, who was smiling in the forest, holding a leave in his hand.</p><br/><p>He was standing in the breeze against the green background, as if he was saying \"Welcome to Beijing!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

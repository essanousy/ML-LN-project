She stabbed his hand back with the compass steadily and accurately, but his skin was not pricked. She must have been practising repeatedly since childhood.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\" Qin Guan drew his hand back, shouting dramatically. \"Help! Help! I\u2019m dying!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei shot a supercilious look at him and said helplessly, \"Stop! I have to submit this design this week. My tutor provided me with a program. It\u2019s a construction plan of a small commercial district. I have to compete against several offices and studios. Don\u2019t bother me. This is the first program I will finish independently and put into practice.\"</p><br/><p>At her words, Qin Guan became serious. He actually wanted to give her a hand. Then he smiled at her next words.</p><br/><p>\"I want to use the car next week. You can take the bus to work. I have to go to Woodbury Premium Outlets on the weekend. It\u2019ll take me more than an hour to get there from the city center.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem! I\u2019ll drive you there. The weekend shooting location is in that area. What a coincidence!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan jumped off the bed and ran to the kitchen. \"I\u2019ll cook! You just finish your design! We\u2019ll work together next week!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put on an apron. His back looked gentle in the warm, soft light.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei smiled silently at the warm picture. The tedious data suddenly became more interesting. The two of them had confessed their love for each other in an impulse, fell in love because of their hormones, and obsessed over each other. In the future, they would be together forever during all the trifles of life.</p><br/><p>It was a fortune to meet each other.</p><br/><p>In June, the temperature was rising in New York. The small independent commercial district, which was located in the New York suburbs, was almost empty except for the tourists and bored housewives. People were pouring in on the weekends though, visiting Woodbury and the other factory outlets of famous brands located there.</p><br/><p>The small town came back to life. Tourists, New Yorkers and residents from surrounding towns went there to shop.</p><br/><p>One could find clothing of their favorite brand from several years ago and get a 10% to 20% discount on it.</p><br/><p>People were eager to find classic designs at excellent quality and reasonable prices. Customers could also find the latest collection in the factory outlets. Sometimes the stores were out of some sizes, and sometimes there were some production defects. For example, an accessory could be missing.</p><br/><p>One could buy those clothes at a 40% to 60% discount.</p><br/><p>What's more, to include customers of all levels, the latest collections of famous European brands were in sync with New York City. As a result, they also attracted customers of high taste.</p><br/><p>Compared to the long lines on Times Square, most high-end customers preferred Woodbury.</p><br/><p>On that beautiful morning, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were stuck in traffic in the suburbs. The traffic jam on the National Day holiday in China was infamous. The scene was reproduced that morning on the road to Woodbury.</p><br/><p>That beautiful day, it felt nice to open the window and look at the green grass and colorful flowers moving in the breeze. The number of cars and people around though ruined it completely.</p><br/><p>The most terrible thing was that the cars were on the road for a full 10 minutes without any indication of moving. A strong man began to yell, and a baby started crying.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at his Citizen watch, which was a present from Qingmu. He had considerately said that it was a gift for his representative contract.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, they had plenty of time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a long breath of relief. As he tried to figure out a way to kill time, he blocked Cong Nianwei's view with his body. Some strong men were relieving themselves by the side of the road. Meanwhile, car doors were opened one after the other. Those shameless guys peed out in the open, while some more decent people tried to use empty bottles.</p><br/><p>There were also people engaging in other affairs. Two convertibles were in front of Qin Guan's car. They were the same exact design, but in a different color.</p><br/><p>One of them was filled with beautiful girls, while the other was full of rebellious men. It was easy to tell. They were wearing so many nose rings that a Chinese man could have played a traditional game of baguenaudier with them.</p><br/><p>Since the cars had to be parked in a row, the women and the men were looking at each other, casting fierce looks back and forth.</p><br/><p>One of the men, who was wearing leather pants and a vest in the early summer, opened his mouth arrogantly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan watched from behind, whispering to Cong Nianwei, \"Wei, look at them. They are much more interesting than a movie.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

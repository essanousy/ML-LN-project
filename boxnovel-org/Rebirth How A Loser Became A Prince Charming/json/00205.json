Huh? Is that a new magazine? A copy of VOGUE too.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll take that VOGUE!\"</p><br/><p>An office worker threw 15 yuan in the box and grabbed the last VOGUE without hesitation before hurrying away.</p><br/><p>The white-collar worker stared at the empty shelf in shock. Her magazine had been taken away.</p><br/><p>\"Do you have one more copy?\" she asked the stallholder.</p><br/><p>Lao Zhang's face was as wrinkled as a blooming chrysanthemum. \"Don't worry, I\u2019ll keep one for you in the evening.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, don\u2019t forget. I\u2019ll drop by at six o\u2019clock. I want the VOGUE with the black-and-white cover.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\" Lao Zhang promised.</p><br/><p>He unconsciously glanced at his watch. It was just half past eight. If the delivery was on time, it would catch the end of morning peak time.</p><br/><p>He called Wang Xiaor.</p><br/><p>\"The number you are dialing is busy now, please call again later...\"</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Mr. Zhang?\" Wang Xiaor answered. His phone was hot. \"Do you want more copies? How many? Okay, wait for me.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, I don't know how much stock there is. I wouldn\u2019t lie to you. We all like money. Just wait for my call.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaor hung up. His five newsstands were all out of stock. He received an extra 100 orders that day. That new magazine was selling like hot bread!</p><br/><p>I should have been aware of this situation. Other colleagues must be experiencing the same problem. I have to hurry and find Brother Pipe.</p><br/><p>It was silent inside the VOGUE headquarters. The assistant looked at the clock on the wall. It was 8:40. Morning peak time would end in one hour and 20 minutes.</p><br/><p>The phones on the table were ringing one after the other.</p><br/><p>\"Hello? Yes, this is the Distributing Department. Okay, an extra 12,000 copies. No problem!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hello, 6,000 for today and 50,000 for tomorrow. Okay!\"</p><br/><p>They answered the phones in a muddle. In two minutes, the statistics were on the desk of the director. The total tally was 17,000.</p><br/><p>SH: 21,000</p><br/><p>TJ: 8,000</p><br/><p>GZ: 12,000</p><br/><p>...\u2026.</p><br/><p>The statistics from 10 cities came out before the sales peak time. The amount reached 80,000 on the first day.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei made several calls. The machines in the printing factories started running again. In one day, 70% of the stock had been sold out. She was expecting the final sales volume during the first week.</p><br/><p>No one would stand in her way. Everyone was in awe of her foreseeing abilities. She was a charismatic leader in their eyes.</p><br/><p>The total sales volume on the first day was 170,000, which was equal to ELLE\u2019s sales volume.</p><br/><p>Looking at the ELLE building and its neon lights across the street, Qu smiled imperceptibly. This was only the beginning. The bold always had the last laugh.</p><br/><p>In time, the sales volume gradually fell down. After the first golden week, it was not worth mentioning anymore.</p><br/><p>An analysis of VOGUE appeared on their competitors\u2019 desks.</p><br/><p>Its sales volume was 1.7 times higher than ELLE\u2019s and 1.3 times higher than Rayli\u2019s. VOGUE was the champion of the month.</p><br/><p>This was the first time this had ever happened in China. Forcing a smile, Yin Yan threw the report into her paper shredder. As she watched the paper stripes fall in the dustbin, she felt something bitter in her mouth, as if she\u2019d just drunk a cup of espresso without sugar.</p><br/><p>There was a chance in front of me, but I didn\u2019t take it. If I could start over, I would have shouted at Qu Xuemei, \"Leave him to me! Leave Qin Guan to me!\"</p><br/><p>Nearly all the advertising departments of the best brands, including watches, accessories, bags, shoes, etc, had received VOGUE\u2019s statistics.</p><br/><p>Satisfied with the surprising numbers, they had drawn a circle around VOGUE.</p><br/><p>On the party for the final editing of \"Graceful Princess\", Fang Pingping flipped through the latest VOGUE absent-mindedly. She showed the cover to her agent unhappily.</p><br/><p>\"I want to be VOGUE\u2019s cover girl.\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why? Qin Guan is on the cover.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is the Asian version, not the original one.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's okay!\"</p><br/><p>Her agent licked her lips awkwardly. \"VOGUE has exceptional taste. Their tradition is to invite famous models to be on their covers. I guess it's possible for Chinese actresses to be cover girls, but you are not that famous.\"</p><br/><p>Fang Pingping got angry. \"Which actress would be qualified enough? Tell me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Zhang Manyu!\"</p><br/><p>\"She\u2019s nothing special! She just debuted earlier, that\u2019s why she\u2019s more popular! If I could get a good script, I\u2019d be more famous too!\"</p><br/><p>Fang Pingping stared at the aesthetic cover photo. If I could be a cover girl, I\u2019d be as pretty and dazzling as Qin Guan!</p><br/><p>Reality was cruel though. Luck did not always favor people.</p><br/><p>In one week, the resumes of models from various agencies were piled on Qu's desk.</p><br/><p>Most of them were willing to take a shot for free. Qu stared proudy at Qin Guan\u2019s cover photo, which was hanging on the wall. It had been expanded several times. She caressed his sexy jaw.</p><br/><p>He is my fastest horse...</p><br/><p>Those battles didn't influence Qin Guan, who was carrying two boxes of beer home from the nearest supermarket.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

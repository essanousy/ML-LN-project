The couple was drawing closer.</p><br/><p>The red head cover was unveiled, revealing the pretty girl behind it. Cong Nianwei smiled shyly as she looked at the man she loved.</p><br/><p>She was so flushed that she looked like she was slightly drunk. The groom was much more beautiful. Even the stars seemed inferior in comparison to him.</p><br/><p>It was a blessed match.</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Look at me!\"</p><br/><p>The photographer was really excited. He was actually Qin Guan's acquaintance. He had been the very person who had shot his first posters. He had become famous and opened his own studio ever since. He'd had to compete with many other professionals to get the chance to take pictures at Qin Guan's wedding ceremony. This would be an honor for his career.</p><br/><p>As the couple walked along the stairs made of white jade and stood at the main entrance of the grand hall, the photos were finally completed.</p><br/><p>When the audience hailed, Qin Guan waved at them.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you all! Welcome to my wedding!\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone left satisfied. Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei exchanged a smile.</p><br/><p>\"Shall we go home like this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Good idea!\"</p><br/><p>The next morning, they woke up in their large queen-size bed. Unfortunately, the peaceful atmosphere was interrupted by the phone.</p><br/><p>\"Shall I answer it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is it? That's so annoying!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Turn on your computer! Quick!\"</p><br/><p>It was Sister Xue, and she sounded exasperated. Something big must have happened. They turned on the computer together and saw a bunch of photos on every website, forum, and blog. Although Qin Guan had already seen them in his previous life, he did not mind reviewing them again.</p><br/><p>It was Teacher Chen, who had detonated that huge bomb in the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>This was the first time a celebrity had revealed their private life to the public and ordinary people had discovered this weird hobby. Some moralists accused him of demoralization, but most viewers just watched for fun.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a little worried. \"I wonder if Tse is okay.\"</p><br/><p>Nicholas Tse was his best friend from Hong Kong. He hadn't been able to prevent Tse from marrying Cecilia Cheung, so all he had done was send him his best wishes.</p><br/><p>\"Are you okay?\" Qin Guan received a prompt reply.</p><br/><p>\"I'm fine, Brother Qin. Thank you for your concern.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are your plans for the future? Do you need any help?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll support my wife to the best of my ability. Everyone has the right to do so.\"</p><br/><p>Cecilia Cheung was very lucky. Other actresses had to cry their eyes out before the camera, while she had her husband's support.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed and called Wang Liying.</p><br/><p>\"Warn our actors and Huayi to be careful these days. The SARFT will not let such a chance go. They will regulate the Hong Kong entertainment circle completely.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall we release the news about your wedding?\"</p><br/><p>\"Later. Let's keep a low profile for now. Don't release the news before my album is out. Of course, the paid vacation time will be cancelled.\"</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hung up the phone with a sigh. A storm would sweep over the entertainment circle soon. For Qin Guan, who had already achieved so much, this was only a trifle, but for some people, who had just gone viral, this would be a disaster.</p><br/><p>Tang Wei, who was also famous for that erotic scene, was used as a scapegoat.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We have a superstar in our neighborhood!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Look at Grandpa Sun! He got on the rooftop with his bodyguard just to confirm that it's him!\"</p><br/><p>\"So did Grandpa Tan. They are the closest to Qin Guan's villa!\"</p><br/><p>\"There's no rush. We can wait to find out.\"</p><br/><p>Grandpa Sun and Grandpa Tan owned the villas on either side of Qin Guan's house. As Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were looking forward to their future and making plans for decorating their new house, the two old men had climbed up to their rooftops. They naturally caught Qin Guan's attention.</p><br/><p>An old man in a frock was standing cheerfully on the rooftop next door. A bodyguard in green was close to him. They looked like soldiers reconnoitring an unfamiliar terrain.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei looked confused. Grandpa Tan burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Stop showing off, Sun! This young couple is not our kind. They have no idea about your great achievements. Plus, you forgot to show off your medals. Take off your coat and dazzle them like me!\"</p><br/><p>Grandpa Sun covered his face. Every time he tried to show off, Grandpa Tan ruined it for him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to the left and saw another old man in a frock. The two of them looked like twins. The only difference was that the one on the left was not as reserved. His medals were sparkling on his chest.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was younger than them, so he had to greet them first.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Grandpa Sun and Grandpa Tan. I'm your new neighbor, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>He turned left and then right to greet them both.</p><br/><p>\"How are you, young man? You look kind of familiar.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I must have seen you somewhere before.\"</p><br/><p>I already told you my name.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the two old men didn't remember his name.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei burst into laughter. Qin Guan waved at the men awkwardly to put an end to the conversation. All three of them had failed to show off.</p><br/><p>On their way back, Cong Nianwei kept making fun of Qin Guan. Qin Guan decided to work harder to become even more famous.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qin Guan's car left, the two men on the rooftop resumed their conversation.</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck... I'm getting down, Sun. Could you please climb on the roof in the summer next time? It's really cold!\"</p><br/><p>\"You deserved it. Don't copy me the next time I try to greet a new neighbor!\"</p><br/><p>Their neighbors scolded them for not getting any useful information about Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan's wish came true. After the Spring Festival, his two films were finally in theaters.</p><br/><p>The uncut version of \"Lust, Caution\" had been banned by the SARFT because of its erotic scenes.</p><br/><p>After cutting about 10 minutes of the film though, the movie was eventually approved. Unsurprisingly, it caused a sensation in China.</p><br/><p>Actually, the film found the right audience in North America. Young people there were more educated when it came to sexuality, and most households had special TV channel for adults. That was a common occurence there.</p><br/><p>However, China was a traditional country that was gradually opening up about sex. Some inappropriate measures had twisted the discussion.</p><br/><p>After three days, the film was pulled from theaters by the SARFT because of the public's reaction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

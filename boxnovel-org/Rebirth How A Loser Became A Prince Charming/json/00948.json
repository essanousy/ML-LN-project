Plus, Heidi is the hostess and I am a permanent judge on the show.\"</p><br/><p>\"Well...\" Qin Guan nodded at them. \"I know why you are here.\"</p><br/><p>\"I have a general idea about the style of this season. I'll reveal some things to you in advance. Only a little though. I'll tell you too, Heidi. I don't think you need my guidance for the interview. A few phone numbers is all you need.\"</p><br/><p>Exactly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's participation was supposed to remain a secret. NBC hadn't revealed it to anyone, so the contestants had no idea about it. Qin Guan would take advantage of this to observe their conflicts and personalities backstage.</p><br/><p>He suddenly raised a burning question.</p><br/><p>\"As everyone knows, every word and action during a talent show is recorded and broadcast publicly. The contestants still act freely and unrestrainedly though, regardless of whether they are right or not. Some of them even talk nonsense. Don't they care about their image?\"</p><br/><p>This was a simple question for Fu Shen to answer.</p><br/><p>\"Americans are inclined to show off. They have been encouraged and worshipped since childhood. If you'd grown up in such an environment, you would have found it normal too.\"</p><br/><p>\"Plus, they are all entertainment-oriented. They know how to attract attention using different means. Individualism always prevails in America. Some people like heroes, while others like powerful villains.\"</p><br/><p>\"Impressing the audience is only the first step to success. They have to try their best to stay on the show. The fashion circle is full of gossip. So, you know\u2026 This may very well be in their nature.\" Fu pointed to his own temple. \"Sometimes geniuses and madmen are very much alike.\"</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\" Suddenly, Qin Guan saw Wang waving at him.</p><br/><p>\"Am I up?\"</p><br/><p>The test of the second round was about to be revealed. Three out of the 12 contestants had already been weeded out. The leftover designers were waiting for the next test.</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Follow me, Qin Guan. You will appear with your old friend.\"</p><br/><p>Old friend?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan met his acquaintance at the entrance of the studio.</p><br/><p>It was Tim, the designers' guidance counsellor. Tim was a fashion critic and editor, as well as a bestselling fashion author in America.</p><br/><p>\"You are here, too?\"</p><br/><p>Tim snapped his fingers at Qin Guan. \"My studio needs some fame and capital as well. The show is really generous.\"</p><br/><p>It was quite fortunate to have Tim join the show. All fashion insiders knew that his nickname was Bitter Tongue. He criticized practically everyone in the circle.</p><br/><p>He even criticized Qin Guan. \"I'm surprised to see an Asian vase in New York.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

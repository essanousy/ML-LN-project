Ever since he\u2019d gotten his driver\u2019s licence, he hadn\u2019t even touched a steering wheel. He was getting busier and busier, and Sister Xue couldn\u2019t always be his chauffeur.</p><br/><p>His career goals had been postponed after graduation, so in his spare time he was looking for a part-time job at a company. He needed a small car to drive to places instead of walk.</p><br/><p>The Yayuncun Car Retailing Plaza was the first choice of any capital resident who wanted to buy a car. In 2000, it had the biggest number of cars and agents. Plus, there was also convenient public transportation there.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of the spare time between his courses, Qin Guan went shopping in the Plaza.</p><br/><p>The boss Qin Guan had cooperated with had promised to sell him a car at its original price through Sister Xue, but it wasn't the car of Qin Guan\u2019s dreams.</p><br/><p>In 2000, a car was a luxury for any individual. 100,000 yuan was only fifty percent of the deposit for most people.</p><br/><p>Because of Qin Guan's age, he had visited more than half of the shops in the Plaza, but few salesmen had been willing to help him.</p><br/><p>They all mistook him for a handsome guy selling insurance or car accessories. Nobody believed that a young man would go there with enough money to buy a car.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qin Guan found what he wanted in the various shops.</p><br/><p>Tens of years earlier, the domestic car market had been on the verge of changing. There had been few brands for ordinary people to choose from, while the prices had been nearly twice as high as they would be 10 years later. Among all the available types, the Cherokee jeep was Qin Guan's favorite.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made his final decision after he saw the actual car. Amid all the flat household cars, the Cherokee, with its 2.5 liters and 5-level manual gear, was quite bold and impressive.</p><br/><p>The price was also reasonable. It was only 109,000 yuan.</p><br/><p>Compared to paying the terrible price of imported Cherokees, Qin Guan thought the manual edition would be fine for him.</p><br/><p>He put down his backpack and sat on the couch of the Cherokee 4S shop. A smiling salesman came up to him.</p><br/><p>F*ck! I know why you sent a green hand like me! You are all lazy! Why didn\u2019t you give me a chance yesterday, when those fat businessmen were here? This young man is obviously just looking around. The prices will scare him off!</p><br/><p>Imagining Qin Guan running away scared, the salesman inquired politely, \"What can I do for you? Would you like to buy a car?\"</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the handsome boy answered, \"Yes, I do.\"</p><br/><p>What? I can\u2019t believe this!</p><br/><p>Remaining professional, the salesman took control of his twitching facial muscles. \"What kind of car do you want?\" His voice betrayed him. It was much higher than usual.</p><br/><p>The other salesmen, who had been chatting behind the counter, stood up all of a sudden. Did we miss an one hundred million sale?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked up to the white Cherokee jeep on the exhibition stand and patted it on the hood. \"This one, today!\"</p><br/><p>The salesman's mouth stretched to his ears. He ran to the reception to get a copy of the contract. Qin Guan looked at the standard contract and asked, \"Is there a gift?\"</p><br/><p>The salesman was taken aback. \"A gift?\"</p><br/><p>\"You know, like a gas filling card, a voucher, a backplate, a food pad, a mop...\"</p><br/><p>The salesman was speechless. That guy was shameless. Why don't you just ask for another car?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan recalled that accessories were not given for free at the time. Before the salesman could say anything, he opened his mouth again and said, \"I don't need solar films!\"</p><br/><p>Okay, the negotiation was not going well. Better just sign the contract. For most salable cars in 2000, common colors were always available in 4S shops.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan opened his backpack and showed the salesman the piles of bills. The salesman fixed his eyes on them. \"Why don't you choose that type? It's better.\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the giant 4.0 litre Cherokee with automatic speed changing, Qin Guan answered in admiration, \"Just take my money!\"</p><br/><p>Liar! I don't believe you! With tears in his eyes, the salesman counted the money and took care of all the necessary procedures. The new Cherokee by the entrance now belonged to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan threw the empty backpack on the backseat of the car. Then he twisted the key and stamped on the accelerator, driving off.</p><br/><p>The salesman handed the contract to his manager before the envious eyes of his colleagues. I might get a bonus this month.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan parked his car under the dormitory building. His roommates were so amazed that their eyes turned red. Even Liu Xiaoyang, who was the richest one among them, felt inferior compared to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Besides, Qin Guan hadn't borrowed a single yuan from his parents. He had earned all that money by himself! Thinking of the remaining balance in his account, which had to be nearly zero now, Qin Guan felt a pain in his heart.</p><br/><p>As he was enjoying the worship of his roommates, the real estate agency called him. The house he had bought in 1998, which had been under construction at the time, was ready now.</p><br/><p>Hanging up, Qin Guan told everyone in a serious tone, \"Are you free now? Who wants to go with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! You even bought a house! Can you really make so much money as a model?\" Looking at his short legs, Liu Xiaoyang wanted to drop dead.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan laughed shyly. \"My parents bought it for me. It's not far from here. Seriously, do you want to go?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why not? We\u2019ll all come with you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s try your car!\" they responded one after the other before trying to squeeze into the cab.</p><br/><p>\"Go away! I\u2019ll drive!\"</p><br/><p>\"First come, first served. I\u2019m the oldest one!\"</p><br/><p>\"There is no father or son on a battlefield. Takers, keepers!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

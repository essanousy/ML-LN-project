It\u2019s a pity that there\u2019s no popcorn.</p><br/><p>\"Look! They are fighting! That man is so disgusting. Is he trying to spit at the girls?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s commentary attracted Cong Nianwei\u2019s attention. They sat in the car calmly with two bottles of water, watching the comedy unfold.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the man stuck his tongue out. There was a skull stud on it, shining in the sunshine.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan moved his own tongue unconsciously. Can he speak with that? He must have a French accent.</p><br/><p>\"Ya are really arrogant... Kang on!\"</p><br/><p>He is certainly stammering.</p><br/><p>One of the girls, who seemed gentle and well-behaved, showed her ears to him. There were seven earrings on them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei burst into laughter as the cars in front of them began to move slowly. All the smoking men ran back and started their cars as fast as possible, while the people in the two cars ahead of them kept provoking each other.</p><br/><p>The boy stood up. He took off his leather vest and threw it towards the backseat. Then he rolled up his shirt to reveal his hairy upper body.</p><br/><p>His skinny figure made him look like a monkey. There was another ring on his navel.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\" He laughed loudly. The driver, who was his friend, looked at the girls proudly.</p><br/><p>Beat that!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a sip of water. He was watching the scene as he was driving.</p><br/><p>The girls were irritated. They did not seem nervous though, They just laughed even louder. The girl cast a disdainful look at her opponent as she rolled her own blouse up.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spit out the water in his mouth, soaking the front window. In an effort to mask his embarrassment, he told Cong Nianwei, \"The glass was too dirty. I couldn\u2019t see the road. I had to wash it.\"</p><br/><p>Have you never seen a windshield wiper?</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei didn't reply. No wonder Qin Guan had done that. She would also have spit the water out.</p><br/><p>The girl was naked in that loose blouse. She wanted to show the rings on her nipples.</p><br/><p>Mission accomplished. The men were stupefied. They fixed their eyes on the girl, their car slowly diverting from the lane.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they were driving along a countryside road, so there weren\u2019t any fences. By the time they came back to their senses, the car had been driven away from the road and fallen down a dirt path. Screaming, they disappeared from view.</p><br/><p>In a few minutes, they saw a broken car covered in mud under their feet.</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>The girl pulled her shirt down and clapped with her friends. Never underestimate the openness of American girls and the fighting capacity of the Russians.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pulled his car into the vacancy left by the men.</p><br/><p>The girls looked at the newcomers with curiosity. Cong Nianwei sensed trouble.</p><br/><p>\"Helen! Do you know that man? He looks familiar.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh! It's f*cking Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is he going shopping with his girlfriend? That b*tch is so lucky!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was about to explode. They looked at the impolite girls carefully. They were shocked themselves.</p><br/><p>They were wearing a combination of smokey makeup and bright colors, piercings and rings everywhere on their faces and bodies.</p><br/><p>Fierce girls!</p><br/><p>They seemed interested in Qin Guan. Except for the driver, all the other girls nearly jumped out of the car. Fortunately, Qin Guan\u2019s car had a ceiling, or they would have ambushed him.</p><br/><p>\"Sign here for me, Qin Guan! Your Halloween cover was fabulous!\"</p><br/><p>\"You are the idol of our underground group, my lord!\"</p><br/><p>That cover was a troublemaker.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei exchanged a glance. Before he could figure out a plan to get rid of his fans, he saw their car get hit from behind.</p><br/><p>The girls fell back towards the car screaming.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! Who the hell hit our car?\"</p><br/><p>It was the truck of those strong men. They had also witnessed the scene and planned on flirting with the girls in their own way.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

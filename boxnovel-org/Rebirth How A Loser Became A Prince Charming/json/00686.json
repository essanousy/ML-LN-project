Suddenly, the crew pushed its way through the gate.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin, Ms. Zhou, the set is ready. You can get to work.\"</p><br/><p>A group of people poured into the room, dissolving the charged atmosphere. Qin Guan had been saved. He rushed into the dressing room, suddenly recalling that they would be shooting all the erotic scenes that day.</p><br/><p>There were at least three erotic scenes that took place at the same location. It seemed like this was his destiny.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xue's high heels walked closer and closer. Qin Guan had to encourage himself mentally. You are thinking too much. Zhou is always like this. Her eyes are full of emotion...</p><br/><p>After a constructive mental pep talk, Qin Guan turned around. He wasn't nervous anymore. He just smiled at Zhou as she approached. His pure smile stunned her for a few seconds.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, everyone!\" Director Chen shouted. \"First scene! Three, two, one\u2026 Action!\"</p><br/><p>As soon as he spoke, the two actors switched to working mode.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>Zhou shut off the lamp. The window of the shabby warehouse became the only source of light. The cold moonlight hit Qin Guan's face, leaving Zhou in the dark.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat down on the edge of the double-decker, looking sad and desperate. The next day, his beloved girl would travel to America with a director. He had failed to give her what she wanted.</p><br/><p>Zhou loved him though. She wanted to give her love and her virginity, the most precious gift a woman could give, to him. She pressed Qin Guan onto the wooden bed roughly. Everyone stared at her in astonishment. The couple's heavy pants echoed around the dark room as Qin Guan struggled.</p><br/><p>He didn't underestimate the petite girl. He would never look down on a woman after his experience with Mou Xiaoliu.</p><br/><p>Zhou's sudden attack caused his back to hit the wooden bed hard. It hurt so much!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan instinctively tried to get away, but Zhou sat down on his waist heavily to stop him. Caught off guard, Qin Guan fell down again.</p><br/><p>Wait! Wait, director! This was not in the script! This is rape!</p><br/><p>Before he could get up and protest, Zhou started kissing his eyebrows, nose, eyes and lips. He felt her hand reach for his belt.</p><br/><p>What are you doing?</p><br/><p>Their first kiss, which had been initiated by Qin Guan, had been beautiful and violent, but empty of any emotion. He couldn't tell if Zhou's kiss was real or not.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sensed the danger. The expression in his eyes was still clear, and he could distinguish between acting and reality. He had never gotten lost in a performance.</p><br/><p>Life was drama, and drama was life. He would rather be the master than the coward. His eyes were glittering, and his breath rose like a mist amid the cold winter of Northern China.</p><br/><p>He looked up at Zhou before he suddenly flipped her over and put his hands on her bare back. Zhou screamed as Qin Guan reversed the situation. The bed creaked in the dark as he landed on top of her.</p><br/><p>Their sparkling eyes met, one pair on top, the other on the bottom. \"Cut!\" Director Chen said before he applauded. The strict director did not do this often, but in his opinion, they had interpreted the original script perfectly.</p><br/><p>\"Wonderful! Did you talk about the script beforehand? You expressed the emotional conflict, sorrow and despair of the lovers perfectly! I am so lucky to be working with you two!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's first reaction was to complain to the excited director, but he chose to remain silent. He could feel a high heel grinding against his foot.</p><br/><p>Because of their difference in height, Zhou Xue had to stand on a stool to tell him, \"Hey! Wait for me!\"</p><br/><p>Help! Cong Nianwei!</p><br/><p>As expected, Zhou took things even further during the next erotic scenes. Qin Guan had to withstand all her crazy advances.</p><br/><p>Hey, don't grind your butt against my crotch, sister! You are half-naked! Hey! You shouldn't be touching my chest either!</p><br/><p>Director Chen got what he wanted, but Qin Guan had to suffer for it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

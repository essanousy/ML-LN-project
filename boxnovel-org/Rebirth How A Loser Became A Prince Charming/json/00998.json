The sky will be the ceiling, and the earth will be the floor. Everyone here will be invited. Nothing would be more meaningful than a wedding ceremony like this one! One couple getting married sounds lonely, but... Just wait!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan ran back to his own tent, where Wang was busy working on something. She suddenly saw her boss rush in like a madman.</p><br/><p>\"Can we have a wedding ceremony here?\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"A wedding ceremony!\"</p><br/><p>\"For whom? You and Cong Nianwei? Here? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly realized something. \"Ha! I could also get married here! What a meaningful ceremony that would be! You are a really good assistant, Wang. That's a great idea! I'll discuss it with Cong Nianwei immediately.\"</p><br/><p>Before Wang could regret saying anything, Qin Guan was gone with the wind. He ran to get his wife as fast as he could. Cong Nianwei accepted his proposal without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\"No problem! I'll be right here waiting for you,\" she said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's proposal inspired the representative of the government, who praised the idea.</p><br/><p>\"This will set a good example for people living in the disaster area. Although there was an earthquake, life still goes on. Happiness is waiting for us ahead! We can organize a temporary civil affairs department quickly. This auspicious time shouldn't be wasted!\"</p><br/><p>After a vote, the idea was approved unanimously.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan submitted his application, he realized that there were many couples like them. More than 30 lovers at the base had agreed to join this important group wedding. Some of them had even lost their families in the disaster. They were all representatives of the strong Chinese people.</p><br/><p>Most of them were young couples who had met and fallen in love during the fight against the earthquake. They were soldiers, nurses, volunteers and villagers. Of course, one couldn't forget about the last couple, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei, who had showed up like free riders.</p><br/><p>\"This is our destiny. I'll cover all the expenses for the ceremony!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's announcement was received positively by everyone.</p><br/><p>Wang smiled as she realized that the second step of Qin Guan's wedding would be skipped. He had jumped directly to the third step.</p><br/><p>She wished him the best!</p><br/><p>The couple's friends went crazy when they heard the news.</p><br/><p>How will we attend the ceremony? What's the exact location?</p><br/><p>They all set out for Sichuan with supplies. When Qin Guan's website was updated, his fans got excited. So did the reporters. This was striking news!</p><br/><p>The headline of the social section of the Xinhua Agency was \"Happiness and Hope\". All the fans and netizens sent their blessings. Some careful fans saw the bright side of the news.</p><br/><p>\"Does this mean that it's a group wedding?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that's good for us.\"</p><br/><p>\"They must need help to organize such a grand event in the disaster area. Maybe we could join the festivities as volunteers!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! This is so much better than a ceremony on a private island.\"</p><br/><p>\"You have a point!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! I have already applied for volunteer work in Sichuan. I'm so smart!\"</p><br/><p>\"Our company will send a rescue team there. I will replace someone on the team.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll go to Sichuan to hand over our university's donation myself...\"</p><br/><p>Their real destination would be Qin Guan's wedding ceremony, though.</p><br/><p>The ceremony was held on May 21st 2008, nine days after Qin Guan's arrival in Sichuan. The couple had been longing for it for a long time. It was a happy, lucky day for them, as they had known each other for nearly 10 years.</p><br/><p>\"Please give me your hands. From now on, I'll be taking care of you for the rest of my life. I love you, Wei!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

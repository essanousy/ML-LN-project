I'm sorry...\"</p><br/><p>\"For what?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, I... I'm Master Qin.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan successfully attracted everyone's attention and took advantage of it to squeeze through.</p><br/><p>\"How are you, Master Qin?\" He heard a deafening greeting. You scared me!</p><br/><p>\"Come on! The performance is about to begin. Follow me to the backstage area!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, sir!\"</p><br/><p>They all followed Qin Guan into the hall, walking between the trembling officers. The martial artists didn't want to greet them.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks!\"</p><br/><p>\"Please!\"</p><br/><p>When they reached the backstage area, the officers thought that was the end of their shocking performance. As the lion dancing groups on the square were about to retire though, a melodious Buddhist song was heard.</p><br/><p>Led by Master Guolin, a group of Shaolin monks and laities walked to the building in a formidable array, surrounded by their believers.</p><br/><p>Master Guolin was wearing a cassock. It was Qin Guan's present, made of Yunjin by skilful Chinese craftsmen. The cassock had golden embroidery and jewellery on it. It was a gorgeous, considerate donation from the Shaolin Temple. Master Guolin gave off a solemn, awe-inspiring vibe in it.</p><br/><p>All the monks and students from the Shaolin Temple showed up that day. Their believers watched their parade and followed them mechanically. The music broadcast had been taken care of by the owner of a record store.</p><br/><p>The most curious thing was that half the followers of the Shaolin Temple were Americans.</p><br/><p>\"Amitabha!\"</p><br/><p>\"You should be begging for alms at the reception.\"</p><br/><p>Master Guolin thought highly of Henry. An American guy who knew about alms was hard to come across. He must be a fan of Chinese culture.</p><br/><p>\"I was invited by Benefactor Qin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh! Come on in, master. Let me show you the door to the backstage area. Qin Guan is inside.\"</p><br/><p>Henry unconsciously used a deferential language. The group of people took a bow before him.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much...\"</p><br/><p>Bare heads flashed before their eyes as the blonde Americans mimicked them. When they disappeared from the hall, all the guests exploded.</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck will they do?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm not young anymore. I could die of a heart attack.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are they kidding? Our guns are not toys!\"</p><br/><p>\"Calm down! You don't understand those mysterious Orientals. You should keep an eye on them, my friend.\"</p><br/><p>Annoyed by his peers, Henry waved around helplessly. \"Don't worry! There is another door especially for actors. I don't think we'll see any more strangers. Probably...\"</p><br/><p>Despite his explanation, no one was in the right mood to appreciate the cocktails on the trays. Not all actors were freaks after all. The officers waited eagerly at the entrance, but it was in vain. The buffet had already opened on the other side.</p><br/><p>While people were enjoying the delicious food and splendid performance on the stage, Henry told Qin Guan to begin.</p><br/><p>To be a man was to be reliable. The special performance, which had cost Qin Guan a lot of painstaking effort, unfolded on the stage.</p><br/><p>While everyone was busy eating the delicious food and chatting merrily, the melodious sound of a flute came from the backstage area. Suddenly, all the lights in the hall went out one after the other. Only a few bright lights above the stage were left on.</p><br/><p>The curtain began to rise slowly, revealing a band that played ancient Chinese music. No one recognized the musical instruments on the stage, but they could appreciate their unique style. They gave off a really beautiful, historical vibe.</p><br/><p>The pipa player performed a solo.</p><br/><p>An awful feeling overwhelmed everyone. They all felt as if they were on a battlefield. The actors walked onto the stage as the music played. No, they did not walk. They jumped.</p><br/><p>The martial artists jumped on the stage with somersaults. They looked aggressive and vigorous in their black uniforms as they stood in line and roared together.</p><br/><p>\"Ha! Hey!\"</p><br/><p>Their Chinese boxing performance was both orderly and powerful, shocking the tough men under the stage. Are they actors or fighters?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

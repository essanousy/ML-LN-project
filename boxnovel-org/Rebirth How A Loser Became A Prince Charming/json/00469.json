In foreign countries, not a lot of people were interested, but indie film fans knew that Qin Guan had won the Best Actor Award of the 56th Cannes Festival.</p><br/><p>He was the third Chinese actor to get that award after Ge You and Liang Chaowei. Everyone wanted to toast to that.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s female fans went crazy online. His fan club was expanding at a high speed. His official fans were as many as 100,000. Most of Qin Guan's acquaintances were frightened. They hadn\u2019t expected their son, fellow classmate, and friend to win the award. Only the word \"f*ck\" could express their sorrow.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Got it!\" Rongzhi shouted with sparkling eyes after working all night long. He had finally found out who Blaire, the freelance writer of The New York Times, actually was.</p><br/><p>Then he discovered his apartment address and IP address through the local network station. Finally, he invaded Blaire\u2019s computer.</p><br/><p>Counterfeiters always saved the original photos or documents in a folder that they never opened in their whole lives. Rongzhi found Blaire\u2019s secret in an encrypted folder.</p><br/><p>\"Show me your secrets. OMG is waiting!\"</p><br/><p>Rongzhi rubbed his hands happily. Then he opened the folder and checked it out.</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck... What\u2019s that?\" Current affairs\u2026 Entertainment gossip\u2026 Rumors... Real news were twisted into completely different reports.</p><br/><p>There were 40 fake reports in total. Blaire had been publishing them in The New York Times for more than a year. It seemed that The New York Times, the newspaper with the highest sales volume in America, published unverified news quite often. Blair was a frequent writer of the newspaper. What a joke!</p><br/><p>If the chief editor was careful, he could have found the loopholes. However...</p><br/><p>Emboldened by his initial success, Blair had continued his unscrupulous fabrication.</p><br/><p>Rongzhi took an excited breath and copied all the proof. Like a dedicated professional, he sent it to both Qin Guan and Vivian. As soon as she got everything, Vivian posted it on OMG, complaining openly about her idol.</p><br/><p>Yes, that\u2019s right. Complaining!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's romantic life was discussed heatedly on the forum by people interested in gossip. They were all really happy about the news.</p><br/><p>In America, such stories were common among both ordinary people and stars. Female fans though, who tended to be perfectionists, couldn't accept that.</p><br/><p>Childhood sweethearts? You cheated on her as soon as you won the award! Besides, that girl was not even beautiful!</p><br/><p>They had a unique opinion on Chinese beauties. They preferred dark skin and thick lips, so Li Bingbing did not match their taste.</p><br/><p>The story changed really quickly though, when everyone found out about the fake news fabricated by The New York Times. It was unbelievable! Now everyone knew about the fake news published by the most popular newspaper in America.</p><br/><p>In a few minutes, the netizens had gone crazy. The striking news were on OMG, where everyone gathered to spread it.</p><br/><p>In 10 minutes, the editors of all the mainstream media and portal websites had heard. Phones rang again and again. Will Ryan, the chief editor of The New York Times, rushed into his office.</p><br/><p>The directors of all the sections were crowded inside, although it was not working hours.</p><br/><p>\"Talk\u2026 Anyone got through to Blair?\"</p><br/><p>Ryan rubbed his temples tiredly. The aggressive, achievement-oriented man was in big trouble.</p><br/><p>\"According to our technical staff, the material online is real. Blair is a fraud.\"</p><br/><p>\"We have to make an announcement tomorrow to correct the fake news...\"</p><br/><p>\"Blair stole information from other media. Now we have to negotiate with those writers and publishers.\"</p><br/><p>\"The victim of his latest story was the Cannes Best Actor winner. His lawyer has sent us a letter...\"</p><br/><p>The calm, efficient man seemed overwhelmed by the bad news. He lowered his head, and then looked up again. Before he could say something to his startled staff, the phone rang again.</p><br/><p>\"Chief editor, you have a call from the board...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

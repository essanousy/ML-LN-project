Famous brands were harder to approach than ordinary studios. They received a large number of resumes every day and couldn\u2019t afford to interview every model.</p><br/><p>The boxes had to be their way to save time for both sides.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at the girl and then turned around to head for the boxes.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, leave your resume here. I\u2019ll deliver it.\"</p><br/><p>The girl stood up from her desk. A voice was repeating in her mind, \"Stop that Asian boy!\"</p><br/><p>She seemed to sense his history. That model was different. How could she describe it? She could only use the word \"charming\".</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Thank you for your help.\"</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Qin Guan handed his resume to her. It was an advantage to leave it to the receptionist instead of throwing it in the box.</p><br/><p>\"Hey!\" The girl stopped him again. \"How is your English?\"</p><br/><p>She thought he was an Asian adventurer. Qin Guan smiled at her. \"Not bad. At least we had a pleasant talk just now.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left, leaving the dizzy girl behind him.</p><br/><p>The girl read his resume carefully and put the file on the most noticeable place on her desk, for fear that she would forget it when the assistant came.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan visited five famous brands in that building, but got similar results. He was experiencing the strictness of the circle.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a cockroach though, so he wouldn\u2019t be crushed easily. He knew he couldn't rely on big brands, so he chose some small studios around the square as his next destination.</p><br/><p>He looked at the time and decided to find Xu and head together to his next destination.</p><br/><p>He found Xu scratching his ears and cheeks in embarrassment in front of a chessboard. He was surrounded by a group of old men.</p><br/><p>New York put a lot of emphasis on city parks. Even in the crowded Manhattan area, there were about five small parks, not including Central Park.</p><br/><p>Those parks were an entertainment venue for retired people. Because of their clumsiness, chess was their favorite game.</p><br/><p>Influenced by his grandfather, Xu was attracted by chess players. There were also small bets made on the games, about one to five dollars a game.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xu had overestimated his ability and underestimated his opponents. He had lost several rounds along with all his money.</p><br/><p>Irritated, Xu grabbed Qin Guan. \"Help me, bro! Can you play chess?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not that well,\" Qin Guan blurted out.</p><br/><p>The old men sighed in relief. That boy looks clever. Thank god he is not a good player.</p><br/><p>\"Lend me some change. Ten dollars, maybe. I have to finish this round. I have to win at least once.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan dag for coins in his pocket as he looked at the chessboard. It seemed like Xu wouldn\u2019t get his five dollars back even in 50 years.</p><br/><p>Time was pressing though. He couldn\u2019t spend his whole day off in the park.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stopped at the thought. He broke the rule that a true gentleman should remain silent while watching a chess game. Foreigners hadn\u2019t heard of that rule anyway. Fortunately, they were in New York. If this had been Beijing, the old men would have kicked them with their canes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan started whispering to Xu. After several rounds, Xu won his first game.</p><br/><p>He smiled like silly at the bills as he was pulled away by Qin Guan. The old men were about to say something.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew what they wanted to say. He didn\u2019t look back. He had helped a player cheat after all.</p><br/><p> The crowd parted, making a path for them. That boy could play chess blindly! Even against the three of us! We better keep silent about it.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Xu Xiaoxiao walked away. They could still hear the applause behind them. It seemed that good boys were welcome everywhere.</p><br/><p>\"How did your interviews go?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. I just left my resume there. The next studios are more important.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? May I be your assistant?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at him carefully and blinked with effort. \"No, thank you. It\u2019ll just take a few minutes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

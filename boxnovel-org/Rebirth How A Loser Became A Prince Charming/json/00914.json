Everyone felt sad. If they were in his place, they might have gone mad.</p><br/><p>The buzz of the camera could be heard clearly amid the silent, deserted night. Qin Guan jumped out of the tub as soon as the director stopped the camera. \"Ouch!\"</p><br/><p>It was uncomfortable for a tall man and a dog to be huddling in a tub. Plus, Sam considered Qin Guan his subordinate, so he used him as a cushion.</p><br/><p>If the director hadn't stopped the camera in time, Qin Guan would have had to have an anti-rabies vaccine.</p><br/><p>The trainer, who had misunderstood Sam's response, patted Qin Guan on the shoulder. \"Well done, dude! Our dog seldom loves anyone this much. Any man he loves must be a good person.\"</p><br/><p>Thank you for your words.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan forced a smile and walked to the resting area. Everyone had to stay on site until late at night. They had a tight schedule, so they had to finish filming as soon as possible. This was the first time Qin Guan was shooting at night.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, waiting for his turn wasn't that boring. The costumes of the extras helped widen his horizons.</p><br/><p>They were wearing seamless nude leather pullovers. When they walked out of the fitting room, Qin Guan got scared. They looked like bald patients. Their pink, wrinkled skin looked like that of a newborn mouse. They were the humans that had been infected by the virus.</p><br/><p>Even a beam of an ultraviolet ray could kill them. Although some aspects of their physique had been degraded, they were really good hunters. Qin Guan was only prey for them.</p><br/><p>When they got ready, all the lamps along the Manhattan streets went out. Qin Guan would fight a battle of wits and courage with them before reaching the end of his life. His dog had been infected with the virus in an effort to save its master and had eventually died.</p><br/><p>All the cameras were ready. Qin Guan had to depend on himself from now on. No one could help him anymore.</p><br/><p>He was suddenly caught in a trap. Qin Guan was hanging upside down from a rope in the middle of the street. He had to save himself. He had to cut the rope off before the hunters got there.</p><br/><p>It was hard to reach your ankles when you were hanging upside down though. It was with great difficulty that Qin Guan folded his body and slowly stretched his hand out towards the rope. Everyone was transfixed by his performance.</p><br/><p>The moment he freed himself from the trap, the fierce monsters arrived. The two sides fought with loud roars. Their movements were too quick for anyone to see them clearly.</p><br/><p>The director handled the cameras from different positions, trying his best to record the crucial moment from many angles.</p><br/><p>The lonely man suddenly stopped being careful. He drove the abandoned car right into the monsters that had killed his friends time and again. His face was twisted in anger, but no one was in the mood to laugh at him anymore.</p><br/><p>Despair prevailed on the site.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A stuntman crashed the car for Qin Guan. Qin Guan wanted to finish the scene himself, but the insurance agent and the director stopped him.</p><br/><p>Efficiency was important. Any action that could possibly delay the shooting schedule was forbidden. This was the first time Qin Guan was participating in a dangerous action film, so the crew had gotten insurance for his safety.</p><br/><p>As a professional, the insurance agent was good at evaluating any dangers that came up during filming. He knew very well what an ordinary actor should avoid doing.</p><br/><p>Thus, as soon as Qin Guan rushed to the site, the agent and Wang Liying pulled him away without hesitation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

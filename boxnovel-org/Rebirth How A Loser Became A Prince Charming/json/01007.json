I don't want to join the Marvel exhibition! I don't want to participate in the film's promotion! The film is a product of the Hollywood assembly line. My presence won't affect anything. I just want to go home!\"</p><br/><p> \"I have read your email, Qin Guan, but you need to stay in America until you finish your job! My expected date of delivery is around next February. You are of no help at home right now. Plus, we call each other every day. There is no difference. Okay, I'm busy. I have to go now. Bye!\" Qin Guan felt like he had been abandoned in a foreign country. He could only fall asleep by holding Cong Nianwei's photos in his arms. As a father-to-be, he was obsessed with his wife and new baby. Even the bustling American downtown couldn't fill the void in his heart.</p><br/><p> He had been invited to attend the largest comic exhibition in the US as a way to promote \"The Dark Knight\". Warner Bros. had invested a lot in the movie, with the intention of creating another superhero legend that would make box office history.</p><br/><p> This was the first time Qin Guan was seeing so many characters from American cartoons. Unlike the elegant, fine cartoons in Japan, American comic characters were tougher and more realistic. People had gathered in the exhibition hall from all corners of the nation, wearing all kinds of costumes.</p><br/><p> The average American loved superheroes. One could see DC and Marvel superheroes side by side, staring at each other with hostility.</p><br/><p> There was Iron Man, Spiderman, The Hulk, Batman... Qin Guan was the only guy not wearing a costume or any makeup.</p><br/><p> As a result, he attracted more attention than the others. I should have at least dressed up as a Doraemon. I look really odd now!</p><br/><p> Some people, who had gone there specifically for him, spotted Qin Guan immediately. The girls, who had seen Qin Guan in the film's poster, thought that he was most likely the most handsome villain in film history.</p><br/><p> It was interesting how many humans liked villains. The Batman exhibition was occupied by those girls, who were wearing different costumes and makeup. Their long legs shocked the other introverts in attendance.</p><br/><p>The girls rushed over to Qin Guan, screaming, \"My love! My Joker! Please take me away! I'll be your slave forever!\" Aren't beautiful girls supposed to love superheroes? Costume stores had welcomed plenty of customers that day. As a result, villain costumes had been almost sold out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

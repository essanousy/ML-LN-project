Those are the standards of Asian beauties.\"</p><br/><p>\"There are so many beauties with distinctive faces. They prefer more noble features. Lv Yan is practically the perfect model. Her career in America could be more successful than Du Juan's.\"</p><br/><p>\"Believe me, Sister Xue. Take her to the makeup room. Train her and present her to IMG. I promise, I have a surprise for you.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue raised her eyebrows as Qu made the decision for her. \"Take the girl. She's good.\"</p><br/><p>Lv Yan would never know that her most important opportunity was decided in those few words. Du Juan seemed to be aware that something was going on. She shot a confused look at the ugly girl in the back row.</p><br/><p>They all decided on a plan for the next day. Suddenly, music started playing and the final competition began.</p><br/><p>Gorgeous girls in avant-garde outfits walked on the stage. The Chinese girls opened their mouths in surprise.</p><br/><p>\"The first and third model are not stepping along to the rhythm.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re right. They are walking to the wrong beat. If Professor Li was here, she would have beat them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! This is hilarious! She is waving at the audience, but her posture is all wrong!\"</p><br/><p>Jay and Qin Guan ignored the comments. Jay was smiling among the chatting girls. It's important to speak a foreign language.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan buried his face in his hands. Short training is not beneficial for girls without a solid foundation.</p><br/><p>The girls on the stage could only be classified as commercial models. None of them was qualified to work for a top brand, which would attract attention to the program in the future.</p><br/><p>The TV station wouldn't focus on such details though. They just needed a program with high audience ratings. The future development of those girls would depend on themselves.</p><br/><p> When Sana and Yazi came out at last, all the Chinese girls smiled.</p><br/><p>The cameras turned to the slender Asian girls with the classic features. Their meaningful smiles could only be understood by Chinese people. The girls watched the two models on the stage.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Tyra Banks\u2019 training, they were actually pretty good. To an outsider\u2019s eyes, they looked completely transformed.</p><br/><p>To attract the audience, Jay tentatively asked Qin Guan about his opinion on them and repeated their advantages again and again. It seemed that, thanks to the program, the two girls had been accepted in the fashion circle.</p><br/><p>Each girl had a dream. The show was conveying a message to the audience through the cameras: Even a sparrow can turn into a phoenix.</p><br/><p>The lively party finally came to an end. The curtain fell and the crew left. So did Qin Guan. Lv Yan had gotten the chance she had long dreamed about. The next day, the Batiste brothers followed the film crew to the airport along with the two Argentinian girls.</p><br/><p>Ever since the Spanish colonists had retreated from Argentina, Buenos Aires had become the largest immigrant city of the country. Soccer was the first thing people thought of at the mention of Argentina.</p><br/><p>Its capital, Buenos Aires, was an ordinary city. If one was a soccer fan though, it was definitely worth visiting.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went out of the airport and realized that people there did not speak English. The official language of Argentina was Spanish.</p><br/><p> Out of hatred for America, people there refused to accept dollars. Foreign visitors were allowed to change dollars at the banks though. According to the exchange rate, one peso was more valuable than one Chinese yuan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan followed the senior directors into a bus heading for the urban area. He had a strong premonition that the film would require hard work.</p><br/><p>After passing by the presidential palace on May Square, going through the most bustling business areas and seeing the most chaotic fashionable buildings, they finally reached the old town.</p><br/><p>The copper roofs of the buildings had become green due to oxidation, and the crowded, dirty streets were out of order. There was domestic sewage everywhere.</p><br/><p>The real charm of Buenos Aires did not lie in May Square, La Boca, Santelmo or Palermo, but in the corners of those streets.</p><br/><p>The new immigrants of different skin colors spoke broken Spanish. They were people who worked hard every day.</p><br/><p>The educated tourists sighed with emotion at the sight of the messy streets. Without those rats shuttling around, the city would have looked better.</p><br/><p>The rising sun brought a scent of corn cakes. The old residents of the ordinary street saw the novelty in that.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

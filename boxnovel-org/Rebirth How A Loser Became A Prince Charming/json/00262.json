You seem like a good girl. Why would you do something stupid like that girl over there?\" [1]</p><br/><p>A blue vein heaved on Cong Nianwei's forehead. Are you even listening to me? \"My boyfriend caught a cold. He\u2019s over there in the medical clinic.\"</p><br/><p>The woman sighed in relief. She pointed to the family planning clinic and said, \"She committed a sin...\"</p><br/><p>As a virgin, Cong Nianwei didn't know what to say.</p><br/><p>Can you lower your voice when you\u2019re talking about others? Those girls with the heavy makeup are staring at you!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was sitting on pins and needles, but so was Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s nothing serious. Just a cold. You better take an intravenous drip though.\"</p><br/><p>\"That would take a long time, doctor. Can\u2019t I just take some medicine?\"</p><br/><p>The doctor smiled wisely. \"I know you are a star. It's my first time seeing a star in an ordinary hospital. Do you see that crowd outside? Just take an intravenous drip and you\u2019ll recover tomorrow. You won't need to seek any further consultation.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan scratched his hair in shame. \"Isn\u2019t there a quicker way?\"</p><br/><p>The doctor looked up in relief. He\u2019s a good guy, he\u2019s not causing any trouble to the hospital.</p><br/><p>He wrote something on his record. \"Pay the medical fees and have an injection at the nurse station. Drink more water and get some sleep. Eat vegetables. No oil or spices. You\u2019ll recover soon.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took the paper and stood up. The doctor shouted to the nurse beside the door, \"Close the door, Xiao Chen!\"</p><br/><p>The nurse did as he said. Qin Guan hugged his backpack in horror. Is there a robber in the hospital?</p><br/><p>The doctor took off his mask. \"Take a picture with me. I\u2019m a fan of yours.\"</p><br/><p>You scared me!</p><br/><p>The doctor and the nurse took photos with Qin Guan happily.</p><br/><p>His cold didn't influence his appearance. It added a delicate beauty to him instead.</p><br/><p>When the nurse opened the door to set Qin Guan free, the doctor smiled to himself proudly. I can use these photos to show off to girls!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei ran to pay Qin Guan\u2019s medical fees. Then she pulled him towards the door of the nurse station.</p><br/><p>Despite his sickness, Qin Guan looked cute.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei sent the bill in and a nurse with a big mask appeared at the small window. \"Go to Room Three!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei patted Qin Guan on the back and found a seat by the door.</p><br/><p>Thank god I don't need to sit with strange women anymore.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered Room Three and saw a line of pointed needles shining coldly in the incandescent light. The nurse broke the small glass bottle easily.</p><br/><p>It was filled with liquid medicine. Qin Guan swallowed nervously.</p><br/><p>\"Pants off!\"</p><br/><p>The strong nurse was looking at him with a poker face.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sniffled and turned around to face the wall. He unfastened his buckle with one hand.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the door opened with a squeak.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Zhao, we are short on cotton swabs!\" A young nurse pushed in happily. The door opened with another squeak. \"Sister Zhao, do you have any extra disposable gloves?\"</p><br/><p>The door opened again with another squeak...</p><br/><p>Are you kidding? I already took off my pants. Do you want me to stand against the wall as punishment?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned his head around and begged, \"Sisters, can I have my injection first?\"</p><br/><p>\"No one wants to delay you. Have your injection.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure, we see plenty of buttocks every day. Who cares?\"</p><br/><p>Of course they cared. They all knew what they were there for.</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen had shown off to them about the picture. All the staff on that floor had heard the news.</p><br/><p>Sister Zhao was still calm. Taking the chance, she pricked Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Before he could react, the needle was pulled out without any blood.</p><br/><p>Sister Zhao told him expressionlessly, \"Pants on. Are you addicted to being naked?\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay...\" Qin Guan pulled his pants up with his back to the nurses, who were sighing in disappointment.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at them awkwardly. I misunderstood them. The masks were covering their greedy expressions.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan went out, the nurses shouted excitedly. \"Did you see?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! He\u2019s so sexy! Those long legs! He should go have a check-up at the urology department!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Zhao broke in, \"If he really did, would you want to have a look? At his age, what sickness would bring him to the urology department?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

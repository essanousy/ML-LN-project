It was a ceremony of continental level, so the festivities had attracted plenty of celebrities.</p><br/><p> NHK would make a full live broadcast, so Qin Guan would not be alone. Countless celebrities, models and brands from the fashion circle would participate in the festivities.</p><br/><p> Zhuchuan was proud to have discovered Qin Guan. He was appreciated by the Citizen headquarters. The board of directors thought very highly of him. Naturally, Citizen would take care of Qin Guan's trip to Japan. They didn't even ask him about his female partner. It was a good chance to promote their brand.</p><br/><p> Fashion reporters were gathering in Tokyo from all directions. They even got there ahead of Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Looking gaunt, Shao Xiaobing and his agent checked in at their hotel silently. His agent had managed to get an invitation to the gala dinner after the award ceremony.</p><br/><p> \"Are we too eager for quick success and instant benefits?\" his agent asked anxiously. \"The contract with Cartier is still valid. If we take advantage of it, we can have some interviews with other brands. Your position in the circle will be secured.\"</p><br/><p> \"Or we could return to China. You could be a top model at home.\"</p><br/><p> Looking at the elegant invitation with the silver engraved words and the black background, Shao shook his head disapprovingly. \"Impossible! Everyone knows Fang has another lover. I won\u2019t go back to square one. I can\u2019t stand those inferior brands. I\u2019m a supermodel with a top contract. I won't lower my standards.\"</p><br/><p> He was no longer confident. Looking in the distance with a gloomy expression, he murmured to himself, \"I won't go home like this. Without a proper achievement. I won\u2019t wait for Qin Guan's leftovers. Never!\"</p><br/><p> Shao would not be convinced by his agent. Meanwhile, Qin Guan was preparing for his trip.</p><br/><p> Sister Xue was delivering orders in an imposing matter to the team from New Silk Road. The promotion manager was rubbing his hands in excitement.</p><br/><p> It was a wonderful ride for his company. New Silk Road had not just gotten an invitation, but they would also be sending four models as Qin Guan's companions.</p><br/><p> It was a great chance. The manager was looking at Qin Guan like a miser looking at gold.</p><br/><p> They went out and saw the Citizen staff waiting by the exit with a big board.</p><br/><p> The experienced staff of both parties exchanged information with each other. Black business cars took them to the exclusive hotel where the attendants would be staying. The grand ceremony would be held the next day. Everyone was busy making preparations.</p><br/><p> They had a whole room especially for getting ready. All their belongings were inside.</p><br/><p> The styling assistants opened their large customized suitcases one by one. There were men's outfits folded neatly inside them. </p><br/><p> As the winner, Qin Guan didn't care about anything. He was only interested in the four male models following him with respect. All except one, Ouyang Fen.</p><br/><p> This was what people called destiny. Ouyang Fen had been Qin Guan's friend when they had been nobodies, but he had not been very successful in his career. </p><br/><p> Although the four models were all outstanding in the company, they were inferior to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> They took a seat in the lounge on the same floor. Some complaisant guys went to order a drink, and one of them pulled a chair out for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Only Ouyang sat down straight across from him, which made the other three guys hold their breath. They were new in the company, so they were not as confident as Ouyang.</p><br/><p> \"Hey, Qin Guan. I always think about us. We started from the same contest after all. You were the winner and I was the runner-up. How come you are so far ahead of me?\"</p><br/><p> Ouyang was still proud. He would never lower his head before Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled impolitely. Looking at the other models, he said, \"Because I\u2019m much more handsome than you. The gap between us is as it should be.\"</p><br/><p> Then he made a gesture, indicating a distance as large as a palm. Everyone, including Ouyang, found it reasonable.</p><br/><p> Ouyang felt better. Qin Guan is not as evil as he used to be.</p><br/><p> However, after a while, the expressions of the four models changed. The three other models tried to hold back their laughter, while Ouyang held back his anger. Qin Guan's hands were on a decoration on the table, which was a miniature of the Milky Way galaxy.</p><br/><p> It was the distance between the Sun and Saturn.</p><br/><p> Before Ouyang, who was ashamed and angry, could pound the table and stand up, Qin Guan said calmly, \"I\u2019m going abroad this year.\"</p><br/><p> All four models stared at him in surprise.</p><br/><p> Are you kidding? It was an honor for every top brand in China to invite Qin Guan to their opening show. An unknown brand could challenge brands from Singapore, Japan and South Korea with his help. Besides, he was the dream of all fashion magazines and the most sought-after male model to be on their covers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

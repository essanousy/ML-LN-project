If she spilled blood on it, it would be considered a crime. On the other side, the law would not punish them for attacking the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"Go!\" the driver ordered, taking advantage of her hesitation.</p><br/><p>After a sharp turn, the car left the troublemakers behind it. Those lucky dogs were confronted by the girl on their way to their cars.</p><br/><p>She poured blood on the other cars, ignoring the siren of the patrol wagon. She was happy she had not spilled blood on the Rolls Royce. As a native, she had noticed the plate number at the back of the car right away. She sneered at those who were ignorant.</p><br/><p>It was lucky that she hadn't done any damage to the car, or she might not have lived to see the sun rise the next day. She shot a look in its direction as the police got her under control. Bon voyage, ancestors!</p><br/><p>The escapees adjusted their clothes in the car and then looked at their benefactor.</p><br/><p>He was a middle-aged man of unique style. He was actually the same age as Armani's son. The authentic suit looked elegant on his body, and his classic Italian features were impressive.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt like a pauper trying to express his appreciation.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much for your noble actions. May I have the honor of knowing your name?\"</p><br/><p>\"Morka Salvador.\"</p><br/><p>He shook Qin Guan's hand before changing the topic.</p><br/><p>\"Good! I've always had an eye for good boys. You are brave and loyal to your friends. I think my family would benefit from meeting you. I will support you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a confused look at Armani, who looked solemn. The old man gave him a meaningful look and then closed his eyes in an effort to relax. Qin Guan understood that Armani wanted to talk about this later.</p><br/><p>The warm rich man changed into a forthright man in a second. He was very easy-going with Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>On their way back to the hotel, they exchanged cards and talked about the fashion circle, as well as the beautiful sceneries in Sicily, as if they were old friends. They parted ways reluctantly at the entrance of the hotel.</p><br/><p>Armani remained silent as they walked down the hallway. Everyone followed him, sharing that meaningful silence. When they were safe in Qin Guan's room, Armani became himself again.</p><br/><p>\"I'll call your staff for you.\" The team had to be extremely anxious after losing its leader.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was making a call as Armani waved at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Come here...\" The two of them had a private conversation.</p><br/><p>\"They won't go too far. They just see the commercial value in you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who?\"</p><br/><p>\"Salvador and his Mafia family from Sicily.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan coughed. \"The owner of the Rolls Royce? He didn't look like a...\"</p><br/><p>Armani nodded in pride. \"The Italian Mafia is not like the vulgar gangs of New York. It's the origin of underground gangs all over the world. They are all very sophisticated gentlemen.\"</p><br/><p>Is this your idea of patriotism? Shall we get to the point?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan scratched his head. \"What do they want from me?\"</p><br/><p>\"To cooperate with them on a movie. Some of them are trying to change their money-making methods. Nowadays, the best way to launder money is by producing a blockbuster.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry.\" Armani patted him on the shoulder. \"The Salvadors are the only family to set foot in the Italian fashion circle. They are very reasonable. They follow our rules. Actually, if you could get along with them for some time, you might come to like them. How shall I put this... They are silly enough to rely on somebody else.\"</p><br/><p>What do you mean by that?</p><br/><p>The revolutionary gang had become a part of Italy. People from different circles maintained a relationship with them. Only a foreigner like Qin Guan could be shocked by that fact.</p><br/><p>He tried hard to come to terms with those astonishing news. A knock on the door brought Sister Xue back to reality.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, here they are! Come in, please...\"</p><br/><p>A few people entered the room and left with Armani, leaving the three Chinese guys stupefied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What do you engage in?\"</p><br/><p>\"Can people actually sleep in tents?\"</p><br/><p>Students came to ask different questions in an endless stream. There were more and more girls as time passed.</p><br/><p>\"Does that upperclassman belong to your club?\"</p><br/><p>\"No? Does his roommate? Or is he a member of another club? He\u2019s not?\"</p><br/><p>\"Would it be right to betray Qin Guan?\" They all nodded. The brothers were complete traitors. They had been under no pressure to do that.</p><br/><p>After Qin Guan had distributed all the leaflets, he washed in the bathroom and took a leisurely walk. He found Liu Xiaoyang in the cafeteria in a black cotton waistcoat and sports pants.</p><br/><p>There would be a grand event in the afternoon in memory of Chamberlain. It was the basketball league cup for the 1998 class. He had to encourage his friends before such an important game.</p><br/><p>Normally, Liu\u2019s 1.72 meter height would have been a joke, but as a straight-A student, he was dreaming of playing for his department in the game.</p><br/><p>His classmates had discouraged him with sincere words, \"You would have been the best choice for an academic competition, but a basketball game requires height and skill. We can do it, but it\u2019s beyond your reach.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang wouldn't back down though. He was a real soldier. If you\u2019re this short-sighted, then I\u2019ll find other friends.</p><br/><p>He insisted on participating in the boy team of the Accounting Department. Most of the players were idiots who couldn't form a basketball team.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was one of those idiots, of course. As a \"professional\" basketball player, Liu Xiaoyang was quite doubted. Judging by Qin Guan\u2019s physical condition, he showed great potential for that game.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt wronged though. He had originally been a fat, short man, who had never participated in such a high-end game in either of his lives.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang would still fight for the Accounting Department though.</p><br/><p>The cooks at the cafeteria had piled up baskets of steamed buns as high as the windows. The rice was cut into small pieces, and there was free soup with tomato, egg and cucumber.</p><br/><p>The smell of the food reminded everyone that it was dinner time.</p><br/><p>The crowd gradually dispersed, the lively gathering coming to an end. The members of the various clubs were happy to arrange their own exhibition areas and enjoy a meal after work.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left in advance to reserve seats for his roommates. If he did not have to ignore the girls who frequently came up to him and asked for the spare seats, the duty would have been considered easy.</p><br/><p>With a high fighting will, Liu Xiaoyang finished lunch as soon as possible. He was equipped with professional sportswear, including Nike basketball clothes, a headband, a cuff, kneecaps and fingerstalls.</p><br/><p>Someone was showing off in the cafeteria, huh?</p><br/><p>There was only one honest guy in the dormitory, and that was Wang Lei. He pushed up his glasses and told Liu, \"Shorts are the best clothes for playing basketball. Sweatpants may not be right.\"</p><br/><p>They all fixed their eyes on Liu's pants, which had a printed \"Seven\" logo on them. They were actually shorts, but they were too long.</p><br/><p>Everybody burst into laughter. The shorts looked like pants on Liu's body. Liu was quite angry with his height.</p><br/><p>After lunch, they accompanied Liu to warm up in the basketball court and prepare for the game in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>There were already several students there, and Liu attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Nobody had equipment as complete as his. The guy was not a player, but an actor.</p><br/><p>As Liu walked leisurely into the court with a ball, everyone was staring at him.</p><br/><p>The more onlookers there were, the more excited Liu grew. He swung his hair back, put the ball under the basket, and showed off to his roommates with his knowledge.</p><br/><p>\"Warming up is the first step to any sport. Look at me, I\u2019m a professional player.\"</p><br/><p>He performed a set of smooth standard movements.</p><br/><p>The onlookers nodded unconsciously. He seemed like an NBA player.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang grew more excited at their approval. He began running around the court, tiny beads of sweats forming on his face after several rounds.</p><br/><p>Li Jie handed him a bottle of mineral water. I could learn something from Liu to attract girls!</p><br/><p>The most difficult part came when Liu returned. He was planning on shocking the audience with his ball skills. Everyone held their breath as he began to dribble proficiently, intending to play a trick.</p><br/><p>His legs moved at high speed, the ball going back and forth between his open calves. Suddenly, he changed the position of his legs and the ball ended up hanging from his loose pants. It bounced twice before finally falling on the ground and rolling away.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! What the hell was that? You scared us!\"</p><br/><p>\"I have a weak eyesight. I think I just saw the god of basketball!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

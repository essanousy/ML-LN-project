They would present the Chinese brand to the American fashion circle together and face the test of the insiders and the critics.</p><br/><p>Sweat covered Guo's forehead and palms. As more and more reporters and spectators gathered in the store, he started sweating like a pig.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan noticed his nervousness and patted his shoulder to comfort him.</p><br/><p>\"Look at me!\"</p><br/><p>Guo turned around to look at Qin Guan. Suddenly, his beating heart calmed down.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing a bright-colored hoodie. Even though he was not wearing any accessories, the pattern on his chest made the hoodie look fashionable.</p><br/><p>The design was a large fancy carp of a traditional Chinese style embroidered with yellow and green threads. The exaggerated design and striking contrast of the colors made the hoodie, which cost only 29 dollars, really fashionable.</p><br/><p>If Qin Guan walked on the T stage with it, the audience might think that it was the latest Valentino collection.</p><br/><p>Under the hoodie he was wearing a pair of loose linen pants. They were long enough to cover the yellow shoes that matched the fancy carp.</p><br/><p>Only an international top model like Qin Guan could transform that cheap casual outfit into high fashion.</p><br/><p>Guo restored his status with his cunning and ability. Qin Guan smiled at him. The young man had created a new world for J Clothing in New York. Qin Guan had promoted J Clothing in China, while Guo had prospered in America.</p><br/><p>Guo carried out the ceremony according to the arrangement of the PR agency. The invited guests were glad to maintain a good relationship with the new rich brand.</p><br/><p>The reporters recorded the ceremony with their cameras, trying to catch sight of Qin Guan after it was over.</p><br/><p>Guo attracted everyone's attention by pulling down a large poster.</p><br/><p>It was a giant poster that hung down from the top of the store. All the spectators were shocked, not by its size, but by the person pictured on it.</p><br/><p>It was a full-body poster of Qin Guan with a green lawn as a background. Qin Guan was lying on the grass leisurely, wearing a pair of white sneakers. The boy looked so fresh and clean. His arms were under his head as he watched two balloons float up to the sky.</p><br/><p>People's hearts warmed at the sight of the poster, but the keen insiders of the fashion circle and the reporters immediately began to think about its meaning.</p><br/><p>The cabs passing by slowly, the shoppers at the Times Square parking area and the bicycle-riding passersby were speeding down to appreciate the beautiful view of the bustling city.</p><br/><p>Attracted by the humongous poster and the exquisite guy on it, the staff of the surrounding stores went out shamelessly.</p><br/><p>The GAP manager shot a supercilious look at the poster. His small posters looked inferior compared to it.</p><br/><p>In 10 minutes, the poster had proved its power.</p><br/><p>Before the ceremony staff could clean up and the guests could leave, customers poured into the store.</p><br/><p>\"Look at that poster! Is that Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! He only wears high-end clothes! This is a casual brand.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know that brand. Their first store opened at the Hilton Fair. I saw his poster there too!\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? So this is a new one! Let's take a look!\"</p><br/><p>Those could be considered calm, ordinary people. Some crazier fans were rushing towards the obvious landmark.</p><br/><p>They went out of the record stores with the single and saw the large poster right away.</p><br/><p>This was destiny. They had to go into the store the handsome guy in the video clip advertised. Everyone surged into the store in a wave.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

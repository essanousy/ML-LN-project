The whole page had a soft, warm color, so the frame of the video stood out against the background.</p><br/><p>When the door of the car opened and Qin Guan came out, the fans began to scream.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan looks his best in a business suit. Is he dressed like a CEO?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, he is a real CEO.\"</p><br/><p>\"I like that style. This is what my dream boyfriend is like. A man with slender legs and calm eyes who wears formal suits\u2026 I love this type of man...\"</p><br/><p>\"A hard-working man is the most handsome kind of man...\"</p><br/><p>They were all lost in their own daydreams as they watched Qin Guan read his newspaper, dine on the airplane and fall asleep on a luxurious chair\u2026 It felt as if they were right there with him.</p><br/><p>The video was perfect for daydreaming.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's two short ads satisfied internet users, yet some people were not that happy. Those promotional clips had reminded them of his new films.</p><br/><p>\"I don't like that advertisement. I prefer to see his real acting skills.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, by this time, Qin Guan had usually announced everything about his new films. The Spring Festival has already passed, yet he has said nothing!\"</p><br/><p>\"Maybe he is too busy with the Olympics?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, no!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone began to whine.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was leaving home to join the crew of \"Soldiers Sortie\". His character would appear half-way through the show, so while all the other actors were already busy working, he'd only just set out to meet them.</p><br/><p>The director was Kang Honglei, who had experience with military themes and focused on character interpretation and the relationships between different characters. That was exactly why the company had hired him.</p><br/><p>Wang Baoqiang, the protagonist QIn Guan had recommended, had been sent to the army for special training. Traditional military men encouraged such shows.</p><br/><p>At the time, family soap operas had been prevailing, so outstanding shows that depicted modern army life were hard to find. The show was based on a script about the personal and professional life of ordinary soldiers, so it certainly met the demands of the market.</p><br/><p>As soon as the military districts received the show's request, they tried their best to facilitate the crew by providing some low-security bases and training fields as shooting sites.</p><br/><p>When Wang finished his special training and joined the crew again, everyone noticed that his spirit had changed. Although he was still silly, he now had an inflexible willpower.</p><br/><p>Actors started joining the crew one after the other, including Duan Yihong, Zhang Guoqiang, Xing Jiadong, and Zhang Yi. All of them had been personally selected by Kang Honglei for their unique advantages.</p><br/><p>Although they had still been nobodies at the time, they did their best to bring their characters to life.</p><br/><p>They knew that this was a precious opportunity for them.</p><br/><p>Kang also used Qin Guan to encourage them.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan will also be joining us. Cheers!\" This was a good motive for them, as every actor who had cooperated with Qin Guan had become popular. Even Huang Bo, who was an ugly man, had become famous. There were so many advertisements and films for him to select from.</p><br/><p>At least, they were better than Huang...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

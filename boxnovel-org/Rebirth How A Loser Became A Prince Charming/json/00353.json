That\u2019s why you chose me.\"</p><br/><p> Gus smiled awkwardly, but Qin Guan\u2019s next words cheered him up.</p><br/><p> \"I want to read the script first. If it\u2019s good, and my schedule allows it, I\u2019ll do it.\"</p><br/><p> \"Besides, you have to sign a contract with my agency in China to make a collaboration between us possible.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's boldness impressed Gus. He\u2019s a good boy who\u2019s devoted himself to the film industry.</p><br/><p> In Qin Guan's opinion, the script was very important. Besides, the shooting would last only a few weeks and take place in New York. The job and the salary seemed to have fallen from Heaven.</p><br/><p> Both the guest and the host were thoroughly enjoying themselves. They kept chatting happily. If the script is not bad, I\u2019ll help him finish the film.</p><br/><p> Just before they finished dinner, the guests of the show headed downstairs. All the activities had come to an end.</p><br/><p> A group of middle-aged men from the Upper East Side walked down with steady steps. Some of them were accompanied by beautiful girls.</p><br/><p> It was a game of willingness. No one could blame them. They made jokes with each other, their young hearts struggling in their aged bodies.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan remained calm. When he looked up though, he saw that Lisa was among those girls.</p><br/><p> The childish girl had her arm locked around the arm of an old man. Her breasts were pasted to his body.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan sighed. The girl had top model potential, but she was wasting it.</p><br/><p> A top model could have an affair with a photographer, a talented designer, a reporter, or someone else from the entertainment circle, but they should never believe those conservative, old-fashioned men from the Upper East Side who engaged in finance and politics. They loved the models\u2019 pureness and youth, but those qualities did not last forever.</p><br/><p> The girls had to compromise again and again until they were lost in oblivion. What they strived for was money, not the modelling profession.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled at the thought, feeling at ease.</p><br/><p> He left the warm tea house and went out into the chilly autumn wind. He stopped a taxi and headed to his next destination, Chelsea Street.</p><br/><p> Just as its name implied, the famous Chelsea Hotel was on that street. The Chelsea family had started its business from a single hotel and then expanded to various sectors. It was a very rich, powerful family not just in New York, but all over America.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was interested in the small designer studios though, not the hotel. That street was the second favorite venue of designers. It was only inferior to Fifth Avenue.</p><br/><p> The largest designer fair in the US took place there. Chelsea Fair was on 15th Street.</p><br/><p> It was like a shopping mall divided by long corridors. Every store there sold accessories, furniture and paintings, all made by original designers.</p><br/><p> No one could underestimate the venue\u2019s avant-garde style. It was one of the most popular antique fairs, and it had been an Indian trading place 300 years ago. Besides, it was also the origin of Oreo cookies.</p><br/><p> Those two points implied the profound significance of the fair.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan had gone there to meet with the staff of J Clothing. Unlike foreign brands, which were gathered around Fifth Avenue and the SOHO business district, they had chosen the foothold near the Chelsea Fair.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was curious about the pioneer.</p><br/><p> They found seats at an outdoor cafe beside the fair. Qin Guan recognized his acquaintance, Guo Nuoyan, Citizen's interpreter in Wangfujing.</p><br/><p> The gifted student, who spoke several different languages had chosen to work for J Clothing, an ordinary company. Qin Guan was both surprised and confused by his decision.</p><br/><p> Guo Nuoyan seemed to read his mind. He gestured at Qin Guan naughtily, acting like he was counting money. Suddenly, Qin Guan was enlightened. He smiled knowingly. My fellow.</p><br/><p> \"Our store will open after the decorations are ready. Maybe in two days. American workers are so lazy. They get off work on time and turn down overtime wages. If we were in China, I would have finished this job two weeks ago...\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan looked at the store across the street. It looked bright and broad.</p><br/><p> \"Why didn't you choose a store on Fifth Avenue or SOHO? It would have saved you time and energy.\"</p><br/><p> Guo Nuoyang\u2019s expression suddenly changed. Looking around, he noticed that most of the pedestrians were young ambitious designers. He furtively took out the company\u2019s latest products from a paper bag by his feet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

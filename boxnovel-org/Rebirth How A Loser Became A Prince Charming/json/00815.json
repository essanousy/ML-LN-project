What a perfect bank! As he was running, Qin Guan decided to rent a safe at a Swiss bank. His fortune was average for a businessman, but he thought very highly of the service of Swiss banks.</p><br/><p>Hawkes Street was where most banks in Switzerland were gathered. There were not just native banks there though, but some branches of famous foreign banks as well. The place was a miniature of Switzerland's national principle, which was that private property was above everything else.</p><br/><p>During the break, Qin Guan had a talk with the consultant, who was a real manager of the Swiss Bank.</p><br/><p>\"Is it complicated to get an account at a Swiss Bank?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not at all. It's just like opening an account at a normal bank, except our employees can't read your paperwork. You can remain anonymous, use a fake name, or even a code. Actually, your only identity here is your key and code. Our bank is the safest, most convenient and private place to keep your fortune.\"</p><br/><p>\"A cheque with our logo is a symbol of high status. Even the police can't ask questions about the capital's origin. Our methods can be dated back to before banks even came into existence.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded, which made the manager get excited.</p><br/><p>\"Please allow me to introduce the VIP services our bank offers. All the services mentioned in the film are included, but we can also offer more if you pay more.\"</p><br/><p>\"Our bottom limit for VIP clients is five million dollars. The richer you are though, the more privileges you would enjoy...\"</p><br/><p>So, it's a safe international system. Qin Guan decided to send Chen Kang to talk to the manager later.</p><br/><p>The man's next words made him change his mind though.</p><br/><p>\"There's no bank interest, and you will have to pay annual fees for capital management.\"</p><br/><p>Why should I deposit my money at your bank then?</p><br/><p>\"The Chinese embassy has an agreement with the Swiss government, so Chinese accounts are under strict control. It will take you two months to open an account here.\"</p><br/><p>So why should I open an account there? The inheritance tax in China is not as high as in other countries.</p><br/><p>That bank serviced people who were trying to hide the origin of their money. For Chinese people with traditional values, this was really hard to accept.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan still made a decision. He was a young businessman after all. Getting interest from a bank did not correspond with his status.</p><br/><p>I have to open an account! The upside is, it would encourage me to make money!</p><br/><p>His tight schedule didn't allow him to wait in Switzerland, so Chen Kang rushed to the city happily and got lost in the streets. He was totally captivated by the place, which was full of gold and money. Before he could come back to his senses, Qin Guan had gotten to work in the UK.</p><br/><p>An American tycoon had lent the crew an old castle he had just bought. The castle, which had been built during medieval times, was a perfect place for historians.</p><br/><p>There were historical frescos, ancient European fireplaces and old long tables inside. The place looked like a cradle of crime and secrets.</p><br/><p>This was the first time in film history that the origins and history of Christianity were analyzed by a scholar. Even a guy without any knowledge on religion would understand everything.</p><br/><p>Of course, the film would be a real puzzle for dumb people, but anyone with a basic level of education would be able to understand after some carefully thinking. It was an objective presentation of information, without any religious bias or radical opinions. That explained why the Catholic unions had been sending threatening letters to the crew, even though everyone had left for the UK.</p><br/><p>Those people would never accept that Jesus had only been a Jewish mortal.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the professor voiced an even more terrible theory. The Knights Templar, also known as the Priory of Sion, had been protecting a person with Jesus' blood from ancient times. If this was proved, Jesus would descend to the earth, for it indirectly attested that he had been a mere mortal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

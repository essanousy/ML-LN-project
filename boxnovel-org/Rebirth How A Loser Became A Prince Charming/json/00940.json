Being in the same stadium as Qin Guan will be my greatest pleasure!\"</p><br/><p>\"You convinced me. I want a ticket, too.\"</p><br/><p>\"If I'm lucky, I might even see him in person. That would be the happiest night of my life!\"</p><br/><p>\"You are right. Wait for me at the stadium!\"</p><br/><p>\"See you there!\"</p><br/><p>They both went offline.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who had no idea about his approaching fans, was currently in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>The award ceremony would begin at eight o'clock, but all the distinguished guests and reporters would arrive earlier. There was also a red carpet event before the ceremony.</p><br/><p>Due to the numerous attendants, as well as the large number of judges and reporters, the organizers always set up two different red carpets. One for the official award nominees and performers, and one for reporters, music critics and business partners from all over the world.</p><br/><p>The first one naturally attracted more attention, as the most famous musicians in America and the entire world would gather there. The second one was more low-key, but the celebrities were still recognized and welcomed with applause.</p><br/><p>The Grammys were a gathering place for musicians around the world, so the two red carpets were a popular idea.</p><br/><p>In order to increase their audience ratings, the reporters would focus on the carpet with the music stars. Only a few shots would be taken of the second carpet. This was actually a wise arrangement.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's presence caused some conflict though.</p><br/><p>Logically speaking, Qin Guan would have to walk on the second carpet, as he was neither a musician nor a nominee. However, he was so popular that the director of CBS would kill himself if he didn't walk on the first carpet.</p><br/><p>What a shocking stunt! No TV station could capture Qin Guan's image except for the one filming the award ceremony. Some smart cameramen had been waiting at the entrance as soon as they'd heard the news. They kept searching the crowd carefully until they finally spotted Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>How had they spotted him in the crowd?</p><br/><p>Easily. All the Grammy guests were famous for their gorgeous, eccentric outfits, which were very different from the famous Haute Couture people wore at the Oscars and the Golden Globes.</p><br/><p>At the Grammys, everyone just wore whatever they wished. Gao Xiaosong saw many strange outfits, including but not limited to, bikinis, wrinkled dresses decorated with light bulbs and umbrella-like skirts.</p><br/><p>Gao had been preparing his formal outfit at the hotel for a full three hours, yet those funny outfits had turned it into a joke.</p><br/><p>This was normal though. This was America, not Paris.</p><br/><p>As a result, it was easy for the reporters to spot a man in a suit. When Qin Guan showed up at the beginning of the carpet in his Armani Haute Couture, everyone rushed over to him.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Did we come to the wrong ceremony? I thought the Oscars were over.\"</p><br/><p>Sweat started running down Gao's forehead. Qin Guan, who was used to such spectacles, greeted everyone calmly without hesitation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

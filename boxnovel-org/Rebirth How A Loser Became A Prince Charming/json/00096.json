The pike fell from his hand, which had loosened unnaturally and was now hanging down powerlessly. Wang Hailiang\u2019s companions ran over to dispel the frightened customers, and used their chairs to hit the attacker.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't understand their foolish behaviour. Will you take care of the wounded instead of hitting the attacker? Although the wound was not life-threatening, it was still dangerous to get a pike in the stomach. It would be fine if Wang got treated in time though. (However, the position of the wound was still important. A man could die if they were stabbed in an artery. Excessive blood loss could cause death.) Wang\u2019s friends were too careless. Bu Qinglu was trying to press against the wound, while the others were just concentrated on fighting. Alcohol made their brains slow.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw that Wang's jacket was already soaked in blood. \"Don't just stand there!\" he shouted to the restaurant staff. \"Call an ambulance!\" His shout made the staff recover from the shock. The cashier dialed the number with shaking hands. \"Hello, 911? There was a murder here...\"</p><br/><p>The man who answered the telephone was confused. \"A murder? You should call the police. We are unable to help a dead man.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no. He is not dead, he\u2019s wounded. He\u2019s got a pike is in his stomach. Hurry up!\"</p><br/><p>When she hung up the phone, she considered calling the police, but seeing the ferocious, strong men in the restaurant, she hesitated.</p><br/><p>The attacker was already lying on the floor, unable to move, with a barely recognizable, swollen face. His resentful eyes were still fixed on Wang Hailiang. He seemed eager to make another attempt if he got the chance.</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang was also lying flat on the floor, pressing on his wound. He didn\u2019t feel so bad, it just hurt a little. There was no massive bleeding. This was a trifle in his experience.</p><br/><p>He was just wondering when and how he had offended the crazy man. He had never met him before.</p><br/><p>The attacker saw the doubt in his expression and laughed. \"You are one forgetful big boss. Don\u2019t you remember Li Chaoliang? You have occupied his turf!\"</p><br/><p>Li Chaoliang? Li Chaoliang? Who\u2019s that? Wang Hailiang tried his best to recall with his non-functional brain. Bu Qinglu reminded him helplessly, \"Ten years ago. Weigongcun. You fought over turf!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Hailiang suddenly remembered. He had been young at the time. That had actually been his first fight with a big boss. They had made an appointment to fight with the gang controlling Weigongcun, whose leader had been Li Chaoliang.</p><br/><p>At the time, his own boss had told him to challenge Li, the spiritual heart of the gang. Once Li was defeated, the gang would lose in the following mass brawl. He was the best at fighting, so he had been sent out first to fight. The result had been clear. Wang Hailiang had become the big boss of Weigongcun, while his own boss had controlled almost half of the city. It was generally considered that Wang had brought down Li. The attacker had been seeking revenge for Li Chaoliang, who had been his father.</p><br/><p>Since Li had been defeated in that battle, he had lost everything. He had lost most of his turf, financial support, and followers. He had been too old to start over. Without followers or friends, he had been like the walking dead. Smoking and drinking, he had had nothing to do but stay at home aimlessly. He had tried to get a normal job, but failed. He had only had gangster skills, so he had been abandoned by modern society.</p><br/><p>Tears were running down from the attacker\u2019s eyes. He had no idea who he hated more, Wang or his dead father. His mother had already died under the great burden of his father\u2019s failure. The man had thought it was his duty to find the source of his family\u2019s disaster. Therefore, innocent Wang Hailiang had become his target.</p><br/><p>He laughed and shouted at Wang, who still looked doubtful, \"Li Chaoliang was my father! You dare claim that you are innocent?\"</p><br/><p>Wang was shocked. Who could I blame for the injustice?</p><br/><p>\"Your father was doomed to be defeated by someone, whether that was me or someone else. That's the rule among our kind. We all respect it.\"</p><br/><p>The attacker laughed like crazy. \"That's right! You are also doomed to meet that end! I was so silly to try to do it myself. I should have waited for your death...\"</p><br/><p>The onlookers were staring at the resentful man silently.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the ambulance arrived and Wang Hailiang was taken to the hospital. Bu Qinglu expressed their appreciation to Qin Guan and promised that they would be the best of brothers in the future.</p><br/><p>Most customers had left the restaurant by then. The whole hall was deserted. Qin Guan's roommates were staring at him in astonishment. Is he a trouble magnet? Anywhere he goes, something big happens.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Sometimes he had to entertain the main characters and villains.</p><br/><p>It was not difficult for Qin Guan, who had played in two TV shows. He was only focused on the money.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could read his lines though, the director waved his hands around.</p><br/><p>\"No, no! Xiao Wang, come here. I want a co-star as background. Ordinary looks would be enough. Why did you find me such a handsome guy?\"</p><br/><p>\"You haven't decided on the protagonist yet. We could find another handsome guy.\"</p><br/><p>\"Nonsense! Both the hero and the heroine were just cast by the producer.\"</p><br/><p>The director knocked on the table with a rolled-up newspaper. \"Even if they hadn\u2019t been though, how could I find someone more handsome than him? Could I ask him to play Cai Jing? The villain? Wait a moment, why didn't I think of this? Love and hatred! That's what sells!\"</p><br/><p>The assistant director wiped his sweat away. You want to cast him as the villain of the show? But this guy is too young to play Cai Jing! This is a period drama.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan handed the notice and script to Sister Xue, who was just as confused as he was. Shall I play villains my whole life?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m leaving China soon anyway. I don't care about anything.</p><br/><p>The leading actors didn't meet until the whole crew was ready.</p><br/><p>The female protagonist was Fang Pingping, and the male protagonist was Li Jie. Qin Guan was a supporting actor.</p><br/><p>Fang spoke to him first when they met. Pointing at him, she said in surprise, \"Qin Guan, it's you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was surprised that she had actually recognized him.</p><br/><p>\"You know me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! You were famous in senior high school!\"</p><br/><p>Wait a moment. What did she mean? She said he was famous? Surely Fang had been the most famous student at their school!</p><br/><p>Fang didn't pay any attention to him. She started reminiscing right away, \"You caused quite a stir at our school as soon as you enrolled. You were the arrogant, gloomy boy from Grade One. Your favorite pastime was reading poems at the playground until the sun set.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was left speechless by her words. Was I such an idiot? No wonder I was famous at school. I don\u2019t sound like a normal guy.</p><br/><p>Fang looked pleased with herself. \"All the girls used to secretly write to you, but I\u2019d intercept their letters. I had asked a group of boys to wait for them before you got to school and throw away the letters at your desk. You should appreciate what I did for you. I know what it\u2019s like to be pursued by lots of people. Girls are more difficult than boys though.\"</p><br/><p>That explained why Qin Guan had had no admirers at high school despite his handsome face.</p><br/><p>He realized Fang was very crafty.</p><br/><p>Li Jie had collaborated with Fang many times in bad shows, so the three young actors got to know each other fast.</p><br/><p>There was no logic to the audience of period dramas. Shows like that had to have handsome actors, beautiful costumes, and an exciting plot.</p><br/><p>The script combined historical events, national feuds, family vendettas, and romance.</p><br/><p>During the last years of the North Song Dynasty, the daughter of Emperor Huizong, Princess Grace (played by Fang) had fallen in love with the young Grand Secretary, Tan Yi (played by Li Jie), who had failed to assassinate Cai Jing, the traitor minister, and ran for his life.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was left speechless when he read the script.</p><br/><p>While he was in the dressing room, Fang and Li were discussing their first scene. They felt strange that the director was focusing on shooting beautiful scenes from the very beginning. It had taken him three times to finish a simple shot. Li's face had become stiff from smiling for so long.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan changed into his costume and came out, Li and Fang couldn't keep smiling anymore.</p><br/><p>They immediately understood the director\u2019s motive. They would have to fight to remain the protagonists.</p><br/><p>Such a villain would put them under great pressure. The audience wouldn\u2019t even be able to tell who the bad guy was.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about their feelings. He was just waiting for his first scene seriously. \"On your marks! Ready? Three, two, camera!\" Qin Guan switched to showing-off mode automatically.</p><br/><p>Fang and Li were surprised. Comparison made a big difference, and that guy was much better at showing off.</p><br/><p>The cameras ran and the scene went on.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Chang handed Tan's letter to Cai Jing, which made Cai believe that he had Tan under control. Holding the letter, Qin Guan smiled charmingly at the camera, fully satisfied and contented. Suddenly, silence prevailed. Everyone around was completely focused on his performance.</p><br/><p>The magnificent costumes of the Song Dynasty and the official bright red gown set off Qin Guan's red lips and shiny teeth. His beauty was really unparalleled.</p><br/><p>No one would believe that he was a traitor minister. Surely, he must have been wrongly accused. It had to be that muddle-headed Emperor\u2019s fault. He took the blame for the Emperor.</p><br/><p>Could you please stick to your principles? You\u2019re defending a historically proven traitor because of a handsome actor. Where is your dignity?</p><br/><p>Fang cast a sympathetic glance at Li. They would be working together in the next scene. According to the script, it would be the most important scene for the hero.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was in an indigo frock made of coarse cloth and his head was bald, which looked very good on him.</p><br/><p> His calm expression and pure eyes made the coarse cloth unable to cover his elegance. He was wearing a professional costume that included a white puttee, rough ropes, grey monk shoes and loose pants.</p><br/><p> Li Zhiying, who had just finished his work, happened to pass by. Yu Min waved at him.</p><br/><p> Lin Zhiying came over doubtfully. Even Director Zhang was shocked.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan\u2019s elegance and talent beat Lin\u2019s, who was famous for his looks in Taiwan.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled honestly at Zhang. He looked even more peaceful when he smiled. He looked like a real monk in that moment.</p><br/><p> The fog lingered around the mountains. There were birds singing in the shade. The young monk had just finished his prayer and was chatting with the pilgrims on the path. \"Amitabha...\"</p><br/><p> The word echoed around the mountains and rivers, sounding like music from Heaven.</p><br/><p> \"Excellent!\" Yu Min, who used to look down on Qin Guan, shouted loudly, patting him on the leg. \"Well done, Monk Xuzhu!\"</p><br/><p> \"He was just in time. We can move on to the next scene. What a lucky star!\"</p><br/><p> Hey, that\u2019s not what you were saying earlier. Where is your dignity?</p><br/><p> Confused, Li Zhiying returned to the resting area. His agent handed him a bottle of water considerately.</p><br/><p> As an actor with the best looks in shows of that genre, this was the first time Lin had encountered a man more handsome than him.</p><br/><p> When the actor was in full costume and makeup, he was away ahead of him in looks.</p><br/><p> He felt a little depressed.</p><br/><p> Meanwhile, Qin Guan was busy learning his martial arts movements. His first scene involved martial arts, and it would be a testament to the actor's quality.</p><br/><p> When the young action director finished his demonstration, Qin Guan told him that he already knew everything.</p><br/><p> The man from the Henan Province, the capital of martial arts, asked Qin Guan in surprise, \"What are you talking about? Don't flaunt your superiority or experience.\"</p><br/><p> \"This is the starting scene. They will only shoot you. If you have to start over, they will waste film and resources. The whole crew will blame you. You are still a newcomer on set...\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan appreciated his honesty. He patted the man on the shoulder. \"Got it. I\u2019ll try to do it in one film.\"</p><br/><p> The young man looked at his back as he left. The gods are fair. He might have a beautiful face, but his brain is average.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan went up to Director Zhang. \"I\u2019m ready.\"</p><br/><p> Zhang Jizhong and the crew were all surprised. He learned the action moves in such a short time? They\u2019re not like lines. They can\u2019t be prepared in advance.</p><br/><p> \"Okay, let's begin!\"</p><br/><p> Zhang turned on the camera.</p><br/><p> The breeze lifted the lower hem of Qin Guan\u2019s gown. The young monk was standing amid the morning mist. The scenery looked like a misty palace in Heaven.</p><br/><p> \"Three, two, camera!\" The camera started filming.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was practising his fist positions by a wild pavilion on a cliff. The soft background music added elegance to the young monk\u2019s moves.</p><br/><p> Both the director and the action director were stupefied by his performance.</p><br/><p> His movements were like floating clouds and water, natural and smooth. It looked like he had been practising for years.</p><br/><p> With a sincere expression on his face, Qin Guan performed the basic fist positions.</p><br/><p> Zhang gradually zoomed in on Qin Guan, until only his face was visible in the frame. It was a handsome face of a sensual, suppressed passion, filled with Buddhata.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan finished his practice elegantly.</p><br/><p> He wiped the sweat off his forehead and repeated several movements, trying to correct some flaws. Then he left the frame and walked to a small tree nearby. </p><br/><p> The whole crew was mesmerized by him. They turned their heads, following Qin Guan's steps.</p><br/><p> \"Camera No. 2, here!\" Zhang whispered.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's face and the tree were in the same frame.</p><br/><p> The young monk seemed to be satisfied with his progress. He cheered himself on secretly and hit the tree hard with his fist.</p><br/><p> \"Ah!\"</p><br/><p> As he roared, several blue veins heaved on his bare head. All the onlookers were expecting the tree to fall down, but Qin Guan retracted his hand and suddenly changed his resolute expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Somebody went up to Ye and embraced him to show off their close relationship.</p><br/><p>\"We'll talk about this later. Let's talk about the people in the D-1 area now. They'll be playing a key role in your future. They will decide what is waiting for you. If they consider your designs outstanding, silly rich men will be chasing you. You could put a sack on your models, and they would still love it. If they think your designs are bullsh*t though, I suggest you create a new brand from scratch. You wouldn't succeed otherwise, even if you made clothes out of gold and silver.\"</p><br/><p>Yin Changtao shivered as he looked down at the strange men sitting in that area. They were all dressed up like peacocks. He wouldn't have been surprised if they had been wearing a set of armor or had a monkey sitting on their heads.</p><br/><p>He hadn't expected that they would be the ones who would determine the future of his career. I have to flatter them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could read his mind.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, this will only last while you are a newcomer in the circle,\" he said scornfully. \"One day, when you are powerful enough in the fashion market, the situation will be reversed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Even if your designs are too weird for the average person, they will consider it an ode to human nature. The fashion circle believes only in a designer's ability. Welcome to the club, Yin Changtao.\"</p><br/><p>He was speaking neither too slow nor too fast. Yin rubbed his head excitedly. \"When will I reach that level?\"</p><br/><p>\"Did you see Giorgio Armani?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan burst into laughter as he patted Yin on the shoulder. \"You are not nervous, are you? Congratulations. You are in the best mental state one can be before a press conference.\"</p><br/><p>Yin smiled unconsciously as he looked at Qin Guan's meaningful smile. He is right. There's nothing to be worried about. Worst case scenario, I'll just return to my small store in London.</p><br/><p>Butterflies were destined to break out of their cocoon and show their beauty to the world. So was Andrew Gn.</p><br/><p>Several traditional musical instruments accompanied the show.</p><br/><p>Du Juan and Lv Yan came tripping down, one dressed in white and the other in black. The lights went out one after the other. People suppressed their screams as the colorful oriental jewellery shone on the stage.</p><br/><p>As white as Hetian Jade. As green as jadeite. As yellow as amber. As red as agate.</p><br/><p>Different colors interweaved to form a mysterious world. The golden and silver threads on the models' outfits looked like a beautiful galaxy.</p><br/><p>In China, people preferred low-key luxury. Fashion lay in the details, not on the surface. The audience was absorbed in the dream. Everyone was feeling as if they were in Heaven.</p><br/><p>Only when the two girls disappeared did the experienced critics come back to their senses. There were no screams or roars, only the cameras filming the event.</p><br/><p>A spontaneous applause erupted gradually like a salute to the high fashion. The audience deemed it worthy of being remembered.</p><br/><p>Two black beauties suddenly walked forward. Unlike the Paris Fashion Week, which preferred to use multiracial models, the Milan Fashion Week seldom chose models of other races. The applause stopped suddenly at the sight of the two black pearls.</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked by the variety of the brand.</p><br/><p>The models' outfits were different in style than those of the Chinese models. The complicated embroidery, multi-layered materials and gorgeous accessories attracted everyone's attention.</p><br/><p>There was an abundance of Chinese silk and embroidery, and the designer had skilfully used a large amount of unsalable leftover jewellery materials.</p><br/><p>The outfits' charm lay in the concept of their design. Qin Guan knew that Yin had succeeded.</p><br/><p>Oil tycoons in West Asia, rich men in Russia and European nobles were introduced to a rising country.</p><br/><p>The next models were European girls wearing elegant, graceful outfits. They were overall very harmonious.</p><br/><p>The audience adapted to the different style of the new brand as the exciting show came to an end. The door to the backstage area, which was decorated with willows and other ancient trees, was opened slowly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

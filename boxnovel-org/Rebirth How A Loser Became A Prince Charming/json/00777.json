The eldest daughter of the rich family had just come back home from school. The actress cheered herself up, afraid that she would lose face before the Chinese actors. Qin Guan was sitting with everyone else behind the camera.</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes were fixed on her. The actress was under tremendous stress.</p><br/><p>She was wearing a white school uniform and holding an old bicycle as she pushed the gate of the villa open. The camera moved along with her.</p><br/><p>Her slender ankles were dressed in white socks, and her fair fingers looked delicate against the wooden gate. Everything about her was elegant and pretty. She was a beautiful young maiden in the prime of her life.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a reaction shot revealed her face.</p><br/><p>The audience saw two braids, a pair of big eyes, a cute nose and a strange, twisted smile.</p><br/><p>\"Cut! Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Director Yin was speechless. It's only a quick reaction shot. What are you doing? Why are you grimacing? What is that expression supposed to mean?</p><br/><p>Xu was tongue-tied. Li Bingbing took pleasure in her misfortune.</p><br/><p>\"We don't need to watch. The first half of the film will be delayed. I wonder when we will go to Tibet. She will need six months just to polish up her acting skills.\"</p><br/><p>Li let out a long sigh of relief. I overestimated the Taiwanese girl. I'm safe now!</p><br/><p>As Xu pushed the bicycle towards the gate tearfully, Director Yin shouted at her retreating back, \"If you can't act properly, just keep your face still!\"</p><br/><p>The director let out a long sigh and let her go.</p><br/><p>Li nudged Qin Guan with her elbow. \"She is supposed to be a young girl. Just look at the wrinkles around her eyes!\"</p><br/><p>You must have seen too many stories like this. Qin Guan didn't answer. Instead, he tried to escape quietly.</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing had spoken loudly, so Xu had heard her comments. The two actresses, who were the same age, exchanged a malicious look. Thus ended the first meeting of the two heroines.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, the relationship among the actors tended to have a big influence on a film, so Director Yin was happy to see them on the verge of fighting. They were supposed to be love rivals in the film after all.</p><br/><p>Two love rivals never coexisted in harmony.</p><br/><p>The director took advantage of the tension between them to pull Xu aside and explain the script to her.</p><br/><p>\"In the next scene, you will meet Qin Guan for the first time. He will be your first love, which is the most beautiful thing in the world. The heroine is a lot like you. Would you show weakness before Li? You are representing every Taiwanese actress right now! Teach her a lesson!\"</p><br/><p>\"Show her who you are and why you were selected to be Qin Guan's partner!\"</p><br/><p>Director Yin was really good at giving pep-talks.</p><br/><p>Xu flushed with excitement. \"Don't worry about me, director! I'll go all out!\"</p><br/><p>Yin gave her a thumbs-up and then turned to Qin Guan. \"Are you ready? Let's start!\" </p><br/><p>\"I'm coming!\" Qin Guan walked over with a yellow bag. \"I'm ready!\"</p><br/><p>\"Attention, everyone! We are shooting the couple's first meeting in Taiwan. Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Xu walked leisurely up the stairs with her bag under the warm sunshine. Meanwhile, Qin Guan had just finished his part-time job, said goodbye to the hostess and the boy, and got ready to head downstairs.</p><br/><p>The young girl and the man met at the top of the narrow stairway.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked down at Xu. Her smooth black hair impressed him. He smiled warmly at the girl, revealing his white teeth. His eyes looked like shining stars.</p><br/><p>\"Are you Yumeng's older sister?\"</p><br/><p>The camera turned to Xu. Thanks to the director's encouragement and Li's mental stimulation, she was not as nervous anymore. She shot a shy glance with her watery eyes and nodded slightly. She looked like a jasmine after a spring rain, trembling in the warm breeze as dew lingered on its petals.</p><br/><p>Everyone was captivated by her smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Any top brand will do. Will Giorgio Armani attend the ceremony? Will I get a chance to take a picture with him? I know he is a good-tempered man. He would never say no to a beautiful woman.\"</p><br/><p>Wang was sitting beside Qin Guan. Both she and Qin Guan couldn't help but look up to the influential Chinese woman.</p><br/><p>\"But...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't know how to answer. Instead, he made a detailed inquiry.</p><br/><p>\"As far as I know, the domestic media do not pay close attention to foreign fashion events. Neither does the Chinese public. They don't know much about international fashion activities. Only insiders of the fashion circle and clothing companies know the true meaning of an invitation like this.\"</p><br/><p>Fan answered straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\"My agency set this rule for me. You know that I'm not a good student. I studied at the Xiejin Film School, but I'm not like you. You are straight-A student. 'Princess Pearl' has made me popular, but I'm a nobody compared to the other two protagonists. The two of them go after very specific roles, so they will get good scripts and sponsors in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"What about me though? I'll be outshined by new celebrities soon. I'm not ready for that. Compared to other female stars...\" She paused and caressed her face absent-mindedly. \"All I have is my face.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm bright and charming. I'm the most beautiful girl in the acting circle according to the media. I'm very popular, but what am I relying on?\"</p><br/><p>Fan forced a bitter smile. \"That's why your agent was so eager for me to come here. I am infamous now, but without any successful projects, my soaring fame will fade away soon.\"</p><br/><p>\"I admit that I originally wanted to use your fame, but then you reminded me of our school life. I'm not cruel enough to do this...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt all kinds of feelings well up in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"I'm not very familiar with the entertainment circle in China, but you must be working with Huayi. Is there a good script waiting for you?\"</p><br/><p>Fan looked helpless. \"They have so many good actors. Chen Hao, Zhou Xun, Li Bingbing... All of them better than me.\"</p><br/><p>Fan suddenly seemed ashamed. \"You are aware of my acting skills... I haven't found the right way yet, but I try to improve slowly. I want to find a way to make more money and reach the top.\"</p><br/><p>\"I want to be a commercial celebrity. I won't be the first to take that route, but I'll be the most famous person to do so. That's not enough though. I need some top brands in order to elevate my status. I have to show my ability to world-renowned brands.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's why I came to ask for your help. You are my only hope. You are the only Chinese star that fascinates them.\"</p><br/><p>The clever woman knew exactly what she needed. Soon, Wang caught herself feeling sympathy for the actress.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan decided to grant her favor for the sake of their good old school days. It was not a big deal for him after all.</p><br/><p>\"How many invitations do you have at hand, Wang?\"</p><br/><p>\"There's eight left, excluding the three conferences you have to attend. It would be okay not to go though. They do not cooperate with us.\"</p><br/><p>\"Give them all to her.\"</p><br/><p>\"All of them?\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to Fan with a worried expression. \"Do you have time to attend them all? Or would you like to just pick one or two? Have you brought enough outfits with you? I could lend you my stylist for a day. You are aware that a formal outfit can't be repeated before the cameras.\"</p><br/><p>Kind people were always happy to help others, so Qin Guan offered to lend Fan some of his staff.</p><br/><p>\"I am. Thank you so much!\" Fan's eyes were sparkling with ambition. All she had done had been to get to this moment.</p><br/><p>\"I'll buy some dresses here. I like shopping in Paris.\"</p><br/><p>She made a decision fast. Before she left, Qin Guan couldn't help but ask her, \"How is your boyfriend doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"We broke up. He never recognized me.\"</p><br/><p>Fan left without looking back. Her bitter smile changed Qin Guan's opinion of her. She was no longer the greenhand she had been a few years ago. Now she rushed towards her goal as if she wanted to prove something to herself or the audience.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

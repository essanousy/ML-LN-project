The winner of the Best Contemporary Instrumental Album was about to be announced.</p><br/><p>It was a relatively popular award, so most of the nominees were pop stars.</p><br/><p>As a pianist with a limited fan base, all Lang Lang could do was hope that IMG and Qin Guan's fame would help him win.</p><br/><p>\"The Winner of the Best Contemporary Instrumental Album of the 47th Grammys is Lang Lang...\"</p><br/><p>Thunderous applause broke out as all the cameras turned to the Chinese young man. Lang Lang was stupefied. Although he was an enthusiastic piano player, he was still a Grammy rookie.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Wake up! Get on the stage!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Gao stood up to hug their compatriot. Lang's stunned face was displayed on the large screen.</p><br/><p>Nobody was in the mood to laugh at the young man though. Everyone expressed their sincerest wishes for the Chinese award-winning musician.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the guests saw a familiar face.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my! That's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is the winner Chinese-American?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, he's Chinese!\"</p><br/><p>\"Brilliant! A Chinese pianist won a Grammy, which is basically the equivalent of an Oscar in the music industry. Is that why Qin Guan came here personally?\"</p><br/><p>The reporters started talking with each other excitedly. Meanwhile, the fans went wild.</p><br/><p>\"Coming here was the right choice!\"</p><br/><p>\"Where is my phone? I'll record the exciting moment. Qin Guan is only 13 rows away!\"</p><br/><p>\"I love you, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>The fans raised a flag with Qin Guan's portrait.</p><br/><p>This attracted the attention of the cameramen. Soon, the fans appeared on the big screen.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! He sure deserves his awards. He brought his own fan club to the Grammys!\"</p><br/><p>It's a misunderstanding! I'm not a troublemaker from the film circle!</p><br/><p>As soon as they saw their image on the screen, the fans started crying happy tears. Viewers all around the country would see them with Qin Guan during the live broadcast!</p><br/><p>By then, Lang Lang had won the award, which was the dream of any musician. The golden gramophone would remain a milestone in his career forever.</p><br/><p>Congratulations! The award belonged to the Chinese people. It was the pride of the country.</p><br/><p>Music on the Chinese mainland had been very boring lately, so any breakthrough was worth celebrating.</p><br/><p>As an outsider, Qin Guan was not as impressed as Lang Lang, who had just finished his brilliant performance and gotten off the stage.</p><br/><p>\"When will Chinese pop music be honored like this again?\" Gao cried out.</p><br/><p>It wouldn't. Not unless the Chinese started buying Grammys.</p><br/><p>When the ceremony came to an end, the reporters and the excited audience were reluctant to leave the stadium.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly realized he had made a mistake. He should have left early. The guests from the first three rows started gathering around him. They were all curious about his presence there. Some of them asked him if he was planning on releasing some music. If his face was printed on a CD, it would be sold-out in minutes.</p><br/><p>Some composers had volunteered to write a single for him. Some had even been inspired by him and decided to write something for him and his fans.</p><br/><p>A few singers asked if Qin Guan could invite them to a film festival. These people were worse than his fans.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was too tired to deal with them, so he took action.</p><br/><p>He shut the door and released Xiao Song!</p><br/><p>The big-faced man threw himself into the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! I know you! Do you want to cooperate with our studio? Great! I have so many good singers in mind!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? Are you kidding? He can't sing half a song properly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't waste your talent on him. Look at me! Would you be interested in my talent?\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop! May I join your latest album? We could sing a duet. If you want to join the film circle, give me a call! I can introduce you to some famous directors...\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait! I'm not done speaking yet!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took advantage of the situation to escape.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

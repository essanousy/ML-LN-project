Qin Guan carried her to the parking lot.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the onlookers, their hearts were peaceful among the noisy park. They could hear each other's heartbeats.</p><br/><p>When they arrived home, Qin Guan got out of the car and ran to the drugstore. Cong Nianwei watched him go doubtfully.</p><br/><p>Excited, Qin Guan returned quickly. He pulled Cong Nianwei upstairs with sweaty hands.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei bit her lower lip and fixed her eyes on Qin Guan's pocket, where a bump was visible. What did he buy from the drugstore?</p><br/><p>Before taking off her shoes, Qin Guan hugged her tightly.</p><br/><p>\"Wei?\"</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall we do something together?\"</p><br/><p>\"I have to think about it.\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s unnecessary. You smell so good...\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" Suddenly, Qin Guan picked up Cong Nianwei and put her over his shoulder. He threw her onto the soft bed with the clean blue sheets.</p><br/><p>Her long black hair spread on the sheets tantalizingly. Cong Nianwei lay in bed, staring at Qin Guan's face above her.</p><br/><p>When they were both naked, she asked, \"Can you?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded, full of determination. \"Sure!\"</p><br/><p>He took out his trophies from the drugstore. Four packages of condoms fell onto the floor.</p><br/><p>You bought too many!</p><br/><p>Her bare shoulders were above the quilt, making Qin Guan dizzy. Cong Nianwei glanced at the condom in Qin Guan's hand and repeated her question, \"Are you sure? Who taught you?\"</p><br/><p>Who? Some Japanese elder sisters [1], of course. But I\u2019d never tell you that. </p><br/><p>\"I taught myself...\"</p><br/><p>Young sex was immature, but fragrant. It was like a mixture of water and milk.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Cong Nianwei\u2019s pain, Qin Guan, who felt like he had just tasted candy for the first time, would have asked for 300 more rounds.</p><br/><p>They lay together under the soft quilt silently, when a call broke the wonderful silence.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the soft girl in his embrace. In the cold winter, he was hesitant to get up. He got up and sneezed from the low temperature in the room.</p><br/><p>\"Did you forget to pay for the central heating?\" Cong Nianwei asked.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan rubbed his nose and said, \"We\u2019ll return home for the Spring Festival. I don\u2019t want to pay for an empty apartment.\" Then he answered the phone.</p><br/><p>\"You ran away as soon as possible after leaving the studio. Did you forget something?\" Sister Xue shouted at him.</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your agent was still talking with the director and you ran away without her!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew that he had run away without Sister Xue, but his agent was strong enough to deal with anything.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue sighed at the stubborn boy. Why is he so obsessed with artistic films? Commercial films are the best way to make money! Look at the \"Heroes\" crew! The executive editor agreed to meet Qin Guan as soon as possible, based only on his resume and videos! He promised that if Director Zhang agreed, Qin Guan would be accepted immediately!</p><br/><p>Director Zhang Yimou had originally been a photographer, so he was always in pursuit of extreme beauty.</p><br/><p>Film quality aside, he was indisputably the top director of his generation when it came to camera angle.</p><br/><p>With the firmest tone she had ever used in her life, Sister Xue ordered Qin Guan, \"Come to the Beijing Film Studio right now! Be a hero!\"</p><br/><p>She hung up before Qin Guan could say anything. Qin Guan turned to his girlfriend hesitantly. He didn\u2019t want to go anywhere that day.</p><br/><p>Lying in bed, Cong Nianwei threw Qin Guan all his clothes. \"I\u2019m sleepy and tired. I\u2019ll wait for you here. Bring me supper.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan picked up the clothes and kissed her on the forehead. \"I\u2019ll be back as soon as possible. What do you want for supper?\"</p><br/><p>\"You choose...\"</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan put on his shoes and looked back, Cong Nianwei had fallen asleep. He gently closed the door behind him.</p><br/><p>He hastened to the Beijing Film Studio and found his babysitter waiting for him by the entrance.</p><br/><p>On their way to the director\u2019s office, Sister Xue explained the situation to him. The key word for the film was \"obedient\".</p><br/><p>The actors had to perform by following the director\u2019s guidance. No free interpretation. No emotion. It was the first domestic audition for the commercial film, which was aiming for an Oscar.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would be auditioning for the only supporting part with lines in the film. He was one of seven nameless swordsmen in Qin. Thanks to the honor of martial artists and the adoration of the country, they had gotten together spontaneously to find Changkong, another swordsman threatening their king.</p><br/><p>They reached their destination just as Qin Guan finished reading the script. It was an ordinary office. The two producers of the film were both inside, discussing all the details.</p><br/><p>They were stunned by the presence of Qin Guan and Sister Xue. The assistant director introduced them to the director and producer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

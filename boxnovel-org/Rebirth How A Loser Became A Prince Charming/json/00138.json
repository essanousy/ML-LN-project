Qin Guan had lost control of his car for the day.</p><br/><p>They squeezed into the car and realized they had a serious problem. The car was overloaded. They asked Liu Xiaoyang, who was the thinnest, to sit in the middle. If they were pulled over by the police, he could hide under the seat.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the SUV had a huge inner space. If it had been an Alto, it would have broken down because of their weight.</p><br/><p>They drove to the real estate agency in the vibrating car. Although Qin Guan would have to wait several months for the house deed, the building could be put to use right away.</p><br/><p>The second phase was still under construction. There was nothing in the basement of the building, and the construction waste had not been cleaned up yet. However, the basic construction had been finished.</p><br/><p>Everyone followed Qin Guan to the third floor. There were two apartments on the same floor. The door on the left was the entrance to Qin Guan's new home in the capital. He opened the door, which smelled slightly of oil paint, and saw the overall arrangement of his new residence.</p><br/><p>There was an oblong living room, and on the south and north side of it there were four bedrooms. The kitchen, washroom, and bathroom were on the east side of the living room, and there was also a big balcony. The light of the setting sun shone on it. The daylighting of the house was pretty good.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made countless adjustments in his mind, while his roommates considered the possibility of purchasing a house in the capital themselves.</p><br/><p>Three of them had decided to stay and work in Beijing after their graduation, including Qin Guan, Ye Dong and Wang Lei.</p><br/><p>They asked for prices at the real estate agency after leaving Qin Guan's new house. The prices had already risen from 1800/m2 to 2500/m2 for a standard house. It was still reasonable though.</p><br/><p>Persuaded by Qin Guan and the sales manager, the boys decided to have a discussion with their parents later in the evening.</p><br/><p>The sales manager wondered if he had hired Qin Guan as a secret salesman. Maybe I did and forgot about him.</p><br/><p>His roommates felt really grateful for Qin Guan as house prices soared. Qin Guan had made them millionaires!</p><br/><p>Good things kept happening one after the other. Qin Guan passed all three subjects in the accountant qualifying test with top marks. He would get the certificate he was longing for in May.</p><br/><p>Then his four older friends sent him the material for the junior accountant test. Qin Guan read through the books and believed it would be easy for him to finish by the end of May.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the J clothing headquarters had opened in Xidan. As their brand ambassador, Qin Guan attended the main show and filled his empty pocket. He earned the capital he needed to make adjustments to his house.</p><br/><p>If Qin Guan knew that his good luck would continue, he would have fainted from happiness.</p><br/><p>John was selected as the LEE model in the US, and he was reminded of his beautiful Asian friend. He was invited to the New York Fashion Week in September, and he introduced his colleague from China to the director of LEE.</p><br/><p>The director was shocked by the photos. Qin Guan looked like a fairy or an Asian angel.</p><br/><p>After checking the list though, he shook his head in disappointment and told John, \"He is perfect, but he\u2019ll have to wait for next time. All the models on the list have been approved. It would be unfair to them to just add someone in.\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides, our designer hasn't seen Qin Guan\u2019s resume. He can't be selected just based on his photos.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, please! Just give him a chance to interview. We will be flying to China for the Capital Fashion Week in November.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re right, John. Why don\u2019t you find a better use for your memory?\" The director took the photos to discuss it with the chief designer of the fashion week.</p><br/><p>J. K. V. was a Belgian designer and the meritorious man who had turned LEE into one of the top jeans brands.</p><br/><p>He focused on ladies\u2019 jeans, which was a successful strategy. Although LEE\u2019s history was shorter than Levi's by 40 years, they were both among the top three US jeans brands.</p><br/><p>J. K. V. took the June fashion week very seriously. Only the visit of the publicity director managed to slow down his hurried steps.</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter?\" J. K. V. took off his glasses and placed them on the table. The director spread the photos happily on the same table.</p><br/><p>\"Who's this?\" J. K. V. became serious right away. He put his glasses on again carefully.</p><br/><p>\"Where did you find him? Asia? Let me think... The store expansion in China? Wow! You found yourself a little gem! He looks unimaginably delicate.\"</p><br/><p>The director told his plan to J. K. V, but the designer shook his head repeatedly, \"Stop joking. We have decided on the arrangement. Even if the young man is standing outside this very room right now, I won\u2019t let him in.\"</p><br/><p>The result was as expected. The director waited for J. K. V. patiently though. He knew J. K. V. too well to believe that he would just dismiss a boy like that.</p><br/><p>As expected, J. K. V. added, \"I\u2019ll give him a chance in the Chinese fashion week in November though. I\u2019ll personally attend the show.\"</p><br/><p>See? A designer\u2019s attention is always necessary.</p><br/><p>Let's leave the office in the US now and go back to Qin Guan. His large posters were hanging on the headquarters of J clothing in Xidan like a demonstration.</p><br/><p>The two different shops on both sides of the mall featured the same model, which attracted fashionable people who happened to pass by.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

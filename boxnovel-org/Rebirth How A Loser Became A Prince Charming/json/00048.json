No more than five minutes into the ball, several girls had already come over to ask him to lead them. Li Jie smoothed his hair proudly and accompanied the most beautiful girl among them to the dancing floor.</p><br/><p>Ye Dong and Yang Jing held hands as they got on the dancing floor. Liu Xiaoyang was sitting aside watching everybody else.</p><br/><p>Mu Lejiang was in love with a girl, and Wang Lei wasn't interested in dancing, so the two of them sat together and drank beer.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had been left alone before one of the girls from their company came up to him. \u201cDo you want to dance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head as he answered, \u201cI\u2019ll just watch for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The disappointed girl returned to her friends, and they all talked secretly together. \u201cIs Qin Guan incapable of dancing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that true? That would be disappointing. His reputation would be harmed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><br/><p>What was Qin Guan doing at the time?</p><br/><p>He was observing the dancers.</p><br/><p>He found that all the dancers, not just the neophytes learning to dance socially, but also the older ones who had been attending balls for a long time, were terrible at dancing. Only Li Jie looked quite good at it.</p><br/><p>Li Jin finished a song and stepped out, drenched in sweat.</p><br/><p>He grabbed Qin Guan's beer to have a sip and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you dancing? Don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t. Look at the girls, they\u2019re practically burning you with their eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled and patted Li Jie. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of robbing you of your title as Prince of the Ball. We\u2019re in the same dormitory and you call me a second brother. I would never want to harm your reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jie was not convinced by his explanation. Setting the beer on the table, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re all talk. Come on, baby!\u201d</p><br/><p>Are you walking your dog or something? Qin Guan looked at Li Jie speechlessly as he stood up. \u201cI hope you won't regret what you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan arranged his shirt, pulled down his sleeves and fastened his buttons. He walked up to the girl who had just invited him, made a gesture fitting to a gentleman, and said softly, \u201cHello, can I have the honour of dancing with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the girls seemed to get excited by his words. They stared at the girl who had been invited with a jealous expression in their eyes.</p><br/><p>The astonished girl was pushed forward by her friends. \u201cWake up. Answer him!\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally returned to reality and answered timidly, \u201cOh, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled and took her hand as he escorted her to the dance floor. The person in charge realized that someone popular was coming. Other people stopped dancing to make way for him, and the DJ shouted at Qin Guan, \u201cHey dude, what kind of song do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked down and asked his partner, \u201cWhat are you good at?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl answered with confidence, \u201cThe waltz.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was stupefied for a moment before he said, \u201cOkay, the waltz it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl looked very excited. I shouldn\u2019t have doubted my Prince Charming. He is still perfect, despite his rude behavior at dinner. All the others are dancing randomly, but my Prince Charming knows the waltz. He is perfect for me.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan thought it was lucky that he had been studying with Professor Li and had learned so much about the body. Dancing was actually one of the best ways to promote grace in models.</p><br/><p>He had learned a lot about dancing, and the waltz was among those things.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you play the waltz?\u201d he asked the DJ.</p><br/><p>The DJ signed that it was okay. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlue Danube\u201d started playing slowly. Qin Guan and his partner were poised to begin.</p><br/><p>Forward, sideways, and a close step. That was the basic pattern of the dance.</p><br/><p>The two of them began their dance with a perfect round.</p><br/><p>Li Jie sprinkled a mouthful of beer beside the dancing floor.</p><br/><p>F*ck! Qin Guan is so busy with courses and part-time jobs. When the hell does he have the time to practice dancing?</p><br/><p>The couple was only getting better and better.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wore straight, western style pants and a white hollowed-out shirt. If his partner had been in a long dress, it would have been the perfect waltz atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The tacit partners continued to turn. Suddenly, Qin Guan twirled his partner around in the spirit of the waltz. They circled around without turning.</p><br/><p>One, two, three\u2026 the twirling movement included three steps. The onlookers held their breath before their excellent performance.</p><br/><p>Finally, they stopped as the music suddenly came to an end. It was just like the darkness before dawn. Silence dominated the whole room. The two of them looked at each other, breathing heavily. Dancing was intense physical exercise.</p><br/><p>Li Jie was shaking as if he had been shocked by electricity.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang was hopeless at dancing, but he had felt the beauty, and he cheered for his idol in blind worship, \u201cWonderful!\u201d</p><br/><p>His shout woke everyone up, an enthusiastic applause echoing around the ballroom.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and his partner answered the curtain call and retreated with leisure.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat down by the table. Before he could take a sip of beer, Li Jie pulled him close. \u201cMy brother, your dancing is excellent. Teach me, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan answered without mercy, \u201cI have no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jie got angry before Qin Guan continued, \u201cIf you are really interested in learning, I could introduce you to a professional teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jie\u2019s expression changed at once. \u201cIt would be my honor. Thank you, my brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls looked at Qin Guan eagerly, like flies around a piece of pork.</p><br/><p>His partner had already returned to her friends, who were discussing Qin Guan heatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, his body is so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHear, hear...\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls looked thirsty for details as his silly dance partner burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>They all shouted, \u201cStop laughing! Go on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re dying of curiosity!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

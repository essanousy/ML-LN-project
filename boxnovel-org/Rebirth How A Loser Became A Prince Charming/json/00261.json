He had never gotten sick. He had thought it was another gift from the gods.</p><br/><p>Birth, death, illness and old age were all undeniable elements of nature after all. Why would the greedy guy wish to be young forever?</p><br/><p>He decided to take advantage of his cold and beg his girlfriend for mercy.</p><br/><p>No sooner said than done. Cong Nianwei\u2019s phone started ringing.</p><br/><p>\"Hello? What's the matter?\" Cong Nianwei was studying for her thesis. She answered the call doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\"Darling, I\u2019m sick. I feel terrible...\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei shivered at his weak, trembling voice. Is that my boyfriend? His voice is so soft...</p><br/><p>\"Where are you, Qin Guan? Is it serious?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m in my dormitory. I have a runny nose and I\u2019m sneezing...\"</p><br/><p>He sounds really sick! Cong Nianwei stopped writing and started moving her pencil between her fingers nervously.</p><br/><p>\"Wait for me. I\u2019ll come as soon as possible!\"</p><br/><p>She threw the pencil down at her desk and disappeared in a whirlwind.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, a taxi pulled up at the entrance of the Capital University of Finance and Economics. The talkative driver had remained unprecedentedly silent the whole way there.</p><br/><p>The girl in the backseat had looked too serious, so the scared driver had sped up unconsciously. Cong Nianwei handed him 15 yuan and rushed out in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, girl! That\u2019s not enough!\"</p><br/><p>Another five-yuan bill fell on the seat.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Here\u2019s your change!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was already 10 metres away from him.</p><br/><p>\"Wonderful! I\u2019ll keep the tip!\" The driver grinned and drove away.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei ran upstairs with red cheeks, her fear evident in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had sounded awful on the phone. It had seemed like he was about to collapse.</p><br/><p>I have to take him to the hospital. Fortunately, Renmin Hospital is not far from here.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei knocked on the door gently.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang answered the door. \"Cong Nianwei, it's you! Come in, please.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei entered the room and saw Qin Guan sitting up in bed, wrapped with a quilt. \"Are you feeling better now?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at the mere sight of her. \"I caught a cold...\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei picked up a tissue and cleaned his snot for him.</p><br/><p>\"You have never caught a cold ever since we\u2019ve known each other. I\u2019ll take you to the hospital.\"</p><br/><p>She lifted the quilt before Qin Guan could react. Then she put the quilt back down again calmly.</p><br/><p>\"Put your pants on first.\"</p><br/><p>Liu covered his mouth and turned towards the wall. Cong Nianwei observed the sky through the window. Looks like a good day today.</p><br/><p>After two minutes, Qin Guan poked her on the back. \"Oh!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei turned around and glanced at him. \"Oh!\"</p><br/><p>They went out hand in hand.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang was confused. How do they communicate with each other? Lovers are different from ordinary people.</p><br/><p>The two of them got into Qin Guan\u2019s car. When they were more than 100 meters away, Qin Guan remembered to ask, \"When did you get your driver\u2019s license?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei looked steadily forward. \"I\u2019m really busy these days with my courses, learning a foreign language and getting my driver\u2019s license. There will be more surprises waiting for you in the US.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at her. That's my girl.</p><br/><p>She was not a clingy girl. She was professional and independent.</p><br/><p>They walked out of the Renmin hospital parking lot. Cong Nianwei pointed to the elevator. \"I\u2019ll register for you. Wait for me at the clinic.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a well-behaved patient that day. He got to the third floor like a good boy.</p><br/><p>The corridor was crowded, but he shamelessly occupied two seats.</p><br/><p>He leaned back against his chair in a daze. He waited for more than 10 minutes before Cong Nianwei came over with a piece of paper. \"You are lucky. There are still some vacancies left.\"</p><br/><p>As soon as she stopped, the doctor in the clinic called, \"Next, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei put the paper and his medical record in his hand and pushed him towards the clinic. Then she sat down and realized something.</p><br/><p>The clinic was near the family planning [1] and gynaecology department.</p><br/><p>A pregnant woman was sitting beside her. As she caressed her belly, she began talking to Cong Nianwei. \"You look so young. Why are you waiting here?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Because of the rising economy, Chinese people had a more disposable personal income, so they were willing to spend money on their favorite actors and authorized DVD copies.</p><br/><p>It was a flourishing year for the film industry. That year, offers, scripts and investment deals were pouring into Qin Guan's office. The business of his firms was also rising rapidly. He was both frustrated and happy to receive an invitation from Tokyo, as two of his films had been selected by the festival.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan decided to walk on the red carpet alone to avoid hurting anyone's feelings.</p><br/><p>The Tokyo Film Festival, which was the only international 9A-level festival in Asia, had been founded in 1985, and its influence was not inferior to any European film festival.</p><br/><p>In 2006, the Busan Film Festival had not come to prominence yet and the Chinese Festival had still been developing, so the Tokyo Film Festival was the most prestigious one in Asia.</p><br/><p>The Japanese entertainment circle featured outstanding animation and high-end post-production procedures. Influenced by surrounding countries such as South Korea, the Japanese felt the impending risk of losing their throne. In an effort to maintain the high level of their festival, the organizing committee had invested a lot of money and labor into staying in the lead.</p><br/><p>One week before the opening ceremony, the Roppongi Area in Tokyo began to dress itself up.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan walked out of the hotel heavily-armed, he saw a beautiful city alight with neon lights.</p><br/><p>There were large cartoon-like signs all around him. The guests' cars were moving along them as people crowded around the red carpet. Flashing lights were sparkling everywhere. Before Qin Guan could reach the red carpet, he was stunned by the other stars standing on it.</p><br/><p>How can I walk on the carpet with that group of people around me?</p><br/><p>He felt the impulse to return to his hotel immediately, but Wang pulled at his sleeve and pointed to the signs. \"The red carpet is only 20 meters long. Based on your speed, it will take you only a few minutes to cross it. The interview will take five minutes and the photos just three... Then you will be able to enter the main hall. Our sponsors will pay you an extra 10,000 dollars for your time!\"</p><br/><p>\"To go, or not to go? That is the question...\"</p><br/><p>\"Go, go!\"</p><br/><p>Money always beat dignity.</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan had misunderstood the organizing committee. Because of his status, they had arranged a place especially for him. He would take the lead in the festival. He was an honor to all Asian actors after all.</p><br/><p>As a result, it was hard for them to find an equal actor to walk together with him. After brainstorming for a long time, they made an inspired decision.</p><br/><p>Some superstars with the same international fame would be Qin Guan's companions on the red carpet.</p><br/><p>This was a difficult feat for the committee, as strictly speaking, those stars were much more famous than Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan's car pulled up to the carpet slowly, he saw Ultraman standing there, waiting for him.</p><br/><p>One rarely saw a fictional character and a real star appear together at such an event. Only in Japan, the country of animation, could the audience witness such a thing.</p><br/><p>Ultraman, who was both a comic book and film superhero, had been assigned to accompany Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The superhero had already emitted light waves twice in an effort to warm up.</p><br/><p>The door of Qin Guan's car was opened by the festival staff. Wang Liying hid inside the car and pushed Qin Guan out. \"See you in the hall later. Go!\"</p><br/><p>As soon as Qin Guan got out of the car, she closed the door and left. Qin Guan was left standing alone, surrounded by reporters.</p><br/><p>Not far ahead, Ultraman was waving his hand at him. Suddenly, Qin Guan felt ashamed. He looked like a small monster about to be defeated by Ultraman.</p><br/><p>The foreign media finally saw a real man. They wouldn't let Qin Guan go easily.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I'll support you no matter what.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a fork hit his head.</p><br/><p>\"No one can study forever, except maybe for rich people. No one can stay in college forever. I'm studying for my profession and my dream. The last part of my journey can't be achieved only by reading books though.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't get angry. Instead, he took her hand.</p><br/><p>\"I understand. You do not need to make any sacrifices for me.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are shameless!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Cong Nianwei recalled something and smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Don't make fun of me. Think about Professor Martin and the college authorities you'll be meeting today!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't take his tutor seriously until he sat down in the meeting room at Columbia University. The old man and the college administrators were after something.</p><br/><p>They had a reason for being so eager. In their eyes, Qin Guan was a money-making machine, a gold-lettered billboard that could attract donations.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the best person to take care of Columbia's external relations and promotion. Chinese students were becoming more and more interested in studying abroad and Columbia was eager to have a share of the pie.</p><br/><p>As a result, the college authorities had decided to offer Qin Guan some favorable terms in his PhD application.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan read the application form carefully. When he looked up, he found his tutor staring at him, waiting for his decision. He handed Martin back the PhD application calmly and began to fill in the working-student doctorate application form.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to turn down both of them, but the favors the old man had granted him during the past two years made him reconsider. He was not cruel enough to decline after all.</p><br/><p>Working students had more spare time anyway. They didn't need to have classes in a fixed location. Besides, Qin Guan's major didn't require extensive research work. All he needed to do was read a lot. That was the best option for him.</p><br/><p>He had to apologize to Professor Martin. The college didn't care if he chose a full-time PhD or not after all. His presence at important events was enough for the administrators.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished the form amid the sound of Prof. Martin's weak roar. When he walked out of the meeting room, Martin's cry followed him out.</p><br/><p>\"You bastard! You still have six months left before you graduate! I will not grant you any leave during that period! And I'll be strict with your thesis, homework and exams! Twice as strict! Just wait and see!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan knew what the word \"bravado\" meant, and why villains liked to shout \"I'll be back!\" It was a powerless scream that came from their hearts.</p><br/><p>As he walked away from the college, he suddenly sneezed. Maybe Martin had cursed him. Or maybe it was just the cold early spring breeze.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan reached the newsstand. His schoolmates liked to visit it often, but it was past rush hours now. The diligent owner was dusting off the shelves with a feather. He must have bought it from Chinatown.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who wanted to read what had happened in America during his absence, found the latest \"TIME\" issue on the shelf. The striking black title on the cover had remained the same. Unlike the magazine's usual red frame though, the cover had a blue frame this time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan happened to know the person on it. It was him. His cover had been postponed until 2004. That explained why he hadn't been notified before.</p><br/><p>This was actually the strategy of the chief editor, who knew about the Spring Festival in China. An Asian star on the cover during that jubilant time would increase the sales volume and influence South-East Asia.</p><br/><p>Plans were not always able to keep up with changes though. As the editor had been about to choose Qin Guan's photo, he had heard some news from the entertainment circle. The young man's film had been shortlisted at the Berlin Film Festival once again.</p><br/><p>The chief editor had put someone else on the cover and kept Qin Guan's photo, so he could use it after the film festival.</p><br/><p>If Qin Guan won an award in Berlin, the headline would be \"Best Actor Again\". If he didn't, the title would be \"Past Glory\".</p><br/>\n</div>"}

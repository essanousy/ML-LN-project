Their prey would have escaped as soon as it saw those colorful clothes.</p><br/><p>What was the meaning of those designs though? They could not be sold in a mall or be put into practical use.</p><br/><p>They were just fashionable.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got on the stage during the grand finale. He was a special guest after all. His outfit was very flashy. One could find all the colors of the rainbow on his body.</p><br/><p>He looked really cool. Except for a few accessories, the upper half of his body was as naked as a primitive man's.</p><br/><p>The outfit was actually very practical. The drooping cloth stripes hanging from his waist could clean the floor like a mop, and the powerful bone sceptre in his hands gave off a domineering vibe.</p><br/><p>His great momentum seemed overwhelming in that space, which could hold about 300 guests. He looked like an ancient flamen, mysterious, dangerous and powerful. A master of life and death at the peak of his power.</p><br/><p>The 50 models from different countries stood up first. They weren't a part of the show, but such an outstanding man was a representative of the entire circle. They stood up one after another amid thunderous applause. They also felt like they were encouraging themselves.</p><br/><p>The invited designers stood up to express their appreciation for the models who displayed their creations. Their cooperation added vitality to the world.</p><br/><p>By the time the last person stood up, Qin Guan had already reached the end of the U stage and stopped to wait for everyone. Then they all got on the stage again for the encore. The three designers and the models burst into tears.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you!\"</p><br/><p>Thousands of words were condensed into that simple phrase.</p><br/><p>Wherever they went in the future, they would keep that moment in their memory forever and use it as a new beginning.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan removed the paint from his body with the help of the assistants, the winner was decided. The guests didn't leave the show. Instead, they got together in different groups and talked in whispers.</p><br/><p>Before the judges could reach a final decision, more and more fashion critics started walking up to Tim.</p><br/><p>\"Alas! There are only three judges? The result could be influenced easily. This is unfair. An impartial talent show should break those old traditions occasionally.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! Do you have any connections, Tim? We won't laugh at you. We'll show understanding.\"</p><br/><p>Ha! You want to join in? No problem. We could have a vote.</p><br/><p>The three guys were so happy that they almost fainted. The cameras turned towards the judges, where everyone had started gathering.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan showed up again in sports apparel, he saw the VIPs filling in a simple voting form.</p><br/><p>This could possibly be the fairest selection method in the fashion circle. Unlike older contests, which could be influenced by the sponsors or the judges, these temporary judges had no personal interest in the outcome. They only voted for fun.</p><br/><p>This was unprecedented in the fashion circle.</p><br/><p>After a while, Heidi Klum got on the stage with the final result. The three lucky designers were standing beside her and supporting each other, in case one of them fainted.</p><br/><p>\"Now, let's find out the final result. The third runner-up is VI! His agile, youthful work was very refreshing for the fashion circle.\"</p><br/><p>A thin man in glasses walked forward after hugging his opponents. This was a pretty good result, but he was still a little disappointed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

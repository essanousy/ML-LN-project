Can you tell us about your experience?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan: I like making money the best. I learned about this profession by accident while I was doing a part-time job.</p><br/><p>Shao nearly burst into laughter. His agent sent him to give an interview without advance preparation? That\u2019s really brave of her!</p><br/><p>If Sister Xue had been there, she would have been mortified. She thought Qin Guan, who had been working really hard recently, would be more reliable than he used to be. She had been too busy helping Huang Bo to come.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan explained to the surprised journalist, \"After I started though, I discovered the hardships of the job. I\u2019m lucky that I don't need to accumulate experience through far-fetched jobs. I met with talent scouts right from the beginning, and they made a plan for me and helped me get where I am today. I have worked at car exhibitions and fashion shows. I have done advertisements for both printed media and TV. After one year, I have earned a lot of experience.\"</p><br/><p>...\u2026</p><br/><p>There were routine questions, which Qin Guan answered sincerely. Shao now had a better understanding of Qin Guan than before. It seemed that Qin Guan was not a man who depended solely on his face.</p><br/><p>After each routine question, the journalist would ask an interesting question to attract the readers\u2019 attention.</p><br/><p>Question 10: You have a larger career than most traditional domestic models. You have worked in TV shows, advertisements and fashion shows. Many people think that you just rely on your youth. What are your expectations and wishes for your future development? Will you focus on modelling, or try something else?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not an idiot. I won't tell the truth. If I reveal that I\u2019m going to the US in one year, it may influence the ratings of the TV shows!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan decided to muddle along with a vague answer.</p><br/><p>\"My friends always complain about how fast time passes. One year ago, I was only a green hand in the circle. With a lot of effort, I have managed to turn into a bird ready to fly in the sky. Although I am still far from becoming a swan, nobody grows up without getting older. That\u2019s how you get life experiences.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, fans don\u2019t need to worry about the influence of time. In 10 years, I\u2019ll be a handsome celebrity. In 20 years, I\u2019ll be a successful man. In 30 years, I\u2019ll be an old man with a lingering charm. No matter my age, I\u2019ll always be relying on my heart. That doesn\u2019t change with the passing of time.\"</p><br/><p>The journalist was amused. They all laughed together.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan thought this was the perfect chance to put a captivating end to his interview. With a serious, sincere expression, he said, \"Before every job, I like to know the story behind the beautiful costumes, the script, or the creative advertisement.\"</p><br/><p>You mean you like to know the profit you\u2019ll be making.</p><br/><p>\"Every job has been like a trip for me. Every time I feel a flash of inspiration, I\u2019ll continue my fashion journey.\"</p><br/><p>Translation: Part-time jobs are everywhere, both domestically and internationally.</p><br/><p>\"Some roads are much longer than you think. Not only in the entertainment circle, but in other industries of the world as well. Travellers without patience and courage will never see their end. Half of this life is reality, and the other half is a dream. I know there will be a lot of pressure ahead, but no matter if I succeed or fail, the experience is always going to be unique. I\u2019ll cherish every chance I get.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan applied his acting skills to the interview. He looked up to prevent tears from falling from his eyes.</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing coughed pointedly. Could he be a sincere boy in nature?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan closed his eyes and opened them again. The tears had disappeared, but his face was shining. If Sister Xue had been there, she would have known that the bastard was about to play his best card.</p><br/><p>\"I keep looking for the most suitable role, but there is no recipe for success. Time and concentration are the only path, and integrity is the only necessity.\"</p><br/><p>He looked at Shao unconsciously, giving him an honest smile. Then he turned around to express his gratitude to the journalist, who finished the interview in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Well done! I could be a speech-writer for party leaders!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stared at Shao, sighing in relief. It seems that I convinced him. My heartfelt speech and lies moved even him, the toughest man in the modelling circle.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, the journalist told Qin Guan that his acquaintance, the Chief Editor, had invited him to her office.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded and bid Shao farewell. As he went out, he felt Shao stare at him in confusion.</p><br/><p>For a long time, Shao was unable to make up his mind. The journalist brought him back to reality though, and he put on his symbolic gentle smile and sat in the same couch as Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Outside the room, Qin Guan turned around suddenly and stared at Shao secretly. He could see his concentration clearly.</p><br/><p>He watched Shao until the interview began. Then he left for the office of the Chief Editor to meet Yin Yan, who thought very highly of him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

For example, \"Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon\" had done pretty well at the Oscars the previous year.</p><br/><p>Doctor Martin looked happily at Qin Guan, who had died gracefully. His colleagues were also attracted by the old background music.</p><br/><p>It was St. Patrick\u2019s Day in the US, the happiest time at Columbia University. All the staff members and students were on vacation.</p><br/><p>The St. Patrick\u2019s Festival, a traditional Irish festival, had been carried on in the US.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was only an excuse for a fun day off. Most Americans had no idea about the real meaning of the festival. They had just changed it into a beer festival.</p><br/><p>Wearing green caps and green shirts, several friends of Martin\u2019s tried to invite him to the parade on 5th Street, Manhattan.</p><br/><p>\"What are you watching, Martin? Is it more interesting than a glass of beer? You are smiling like an idiot!\" Martin turned the screen to them, as if he was showing off some kind of treasure. \"Look! He is my new student. What do you think?\"</p><br/><p>\"Which one?\" The aged men inched closer to the computer.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! He is flying! He\u2019s flying backwards!\"</p><br/><p>The video was part of \"The Legend of A Swordsman\". It was funny, but they could understand the plot thanks to Qin Guan\u2019s simple translation.</p><br/><p>\"What a handsome boy! He looked handsome even as he died! How wonderful are Chinese martial arts!\"</p><br/><p>\"Martin?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Could we negotiate over him? We are in the same department, and you have many choices every year. Could you give him to me? He is quite different from the previous Chinese students.\"</p><br/><p>\"Never! Are you aware of his status in the Chinese entertainment circle? He\u2019s like Tom Cruise in Hollywood. Tom Cruise! Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Those simple academics were convinced. How could they be so naive considering their age?</p><br/><p>It made sense though. As bookworms, they only engaged in scientific research and drinking beer. They knew nothing about famous actors.</p><br/><p>They all sighed in admiration repeatedly. After watching flying flowers, swords and tears on the screen, they turned their eyes away.</p><br/><p>Martin was satisfied with the effect. Putting on his own green cap, he went off with his old friends.</p><br/><p>Actually, he looked like the main character in a traditional video game. A green-clothed plumber, to be exact.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was busy dealing with work before going abroad.</p><br/><p>He had to hand his work at the club and the company over to Bu Qinglu. In the future, he would have to rely on Bu to carry on that daily work. He had finished all his other jobs, except the one with J Clothing.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qin Guan were waiting at the J Clothing Headquarters in confusion. A.M. had turned down any plans related to Qin Guan. Why had J Clothing invited them there?</p><br/><p>The door opened and the boss of J Clothing walked in.</p><br/><p>\"Long time no see, Qin Guan and Xue Wanyi!\" he greeted them both like old friends.</p><br/><p>\"Hi!\" Qin Guan and Sister Xue answered in surprise.</p><br/><p>\"I know about Qin Guan\u2019s plans. So you don't want to renew our contract for next year? Thanks for the early notice. There are few men as honest as Qin Guan these days. They may get that money first.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue gave him a proud, sad smile. \"We have been good friends for many years. We met each other when we were all nobodies. We would never cheat you.\"</p><br/><p>The other snobbish guys had disappeared the moment they had heard the news. They were afraid that Qin Guan\u2019s departure would influence their sales volume.</p><br/><p>The boss laughed happily. \"I\u2019ll never give up my ambassador. I didn\u2019t invite you here just to meet with old friends, but to discuss our contract for next year.\"</p><br/><p>The man pushed two thick piles of paper towards them and fell silent, waiting for their response.</p><br/><p>\"What? Do you know what going abroad means for a model? It\u2019s like cold storage! The audience won\u2019t be able to hear news about Qin Guan in the media. It is not worth the trouble. You are a businessman!\"</p><br/><p>As she tried to persuade him, Sister Xue read through the contract.</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, just keep reading.\" The man smiled like a shrewd businessman.</p><br/><p>Finally, Sister Xue saw the different terms on the contract.</p><br/><p>\"Ha! You plan on entering the US market? You\u2019ll open your first store in Manhattan? That\u2019s so bold!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

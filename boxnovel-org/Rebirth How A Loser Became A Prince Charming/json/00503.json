Welcome to Harvard and the academic exchange program. Of course, during the exchange, we should combine hard effort with fun. Shall we have a sports activity to relax after a hard-working day? Do you guys want to admire Qin Guan's abilities on the court?\"</p><br/><p>The guy was very charismatic. Both the Harvard students and some Columbia students looked excited over his suggestion.</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, I support you!\"</p><br/><p>I\u2019m doomed. Qin Guan looked around, only to see a group of thin short guys, stocky Xu Xiaoxiao and smart Lan Jin.</p><br/><p>Putting on a warm smile, he raised a question.</p><br/><p>\"Columbia students are no professional athletes. Won\u2019t the competition be unfair for us?\"</p><br/><p>The guy winked at him. \"It\u2019s no big deal. We just want to compete against you. Am I right, my friends?\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides, you can choose any sport you like. We have all kinds of equipment and facilities here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Qin Guan! Anything you like! We support you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was enlightened.</p><br/><p>\"Anything I like?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I choose ping pong.\"</p><br/><p>The strong men froze at once, while the Chinese students burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Chinese ping pong players are the best ping pong players...\"</p><br/><p>\"Who can play ping pong? I don\u2019t even know the rules!\"</p><br/><p>After a short discussion, they rejected his proposal. \"No can do. No one could beat you at that. Plus, we prefer outdoor sports! Everyone enjoys those!\"</p><br/><p>It seemed like they wouldn\u2019t give up until Qin Guan made a fool of himself. Okay. There\u2019s a key for each lock. Who cares!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded at them. Then the crowd followed him and the athletes to the court.</p><br/><p>The students hanging out there were shocked by the big crowd. When they were informed about the situation though, they volunteered to help.</p><br/><p>Actually, they were interested in the competition. The only Columbia athlete did not seem like a very good player. With such a good chance of beating their opponent, anyone would be happy to participate.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went to the locker room with his sportswear. As he changed, he analysed the advantages of both sides.</p><br/><p>The power-oriented sports, which included shot put, discus, javelin and hammer throw, could be dealt with.</p><br/><p>Dash races were a lost cause though. There were several black men on the other side.</p><br/><p>There were only a few choices left: the high jump, the long jump and the pole vault.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan went out of the locker room and told Cong Nianwei his idea. Cong Nianwei burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Do you believe in me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure! You are my girlfriend!\"</p><br/><p>\"Long jump. Trust me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why?\"</p><br/><p>\"Idiot! Your fans don't care about the result of the competition. They are just intrigued by your glamor. If you run and crawl back like a dog, they will leave without looking back. Don't pay attention to the others. Just try to look as handsome as possible. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised an eyebrow. It\u2019s that simple?</p><br/><p>He had unconsciously gotten used to victory. I\u2019ll just try my best.</p><br/><p>He hugged her around the shoulders and handed her his clothes. \"Watch me and cheer for me!\" Then he strode out. Before leaving, he waved back at her.</p><br/><p>Holding his clothes in her arms, Cong Nianwei smiled. \"Idiot! You don\u2019t need to show off with me!\"</p><br/><p>It was a hot summer afternoon. The temperature rose even more. Qin Guan was wearing a black tank and a pair of shorts that complimented his perfect figure.</p><br/><p>His muscles looked smooth and graceful. He looked like the favorite of the gods, like a pearl shining among plain rocks.</p><br/><p>Screams rose from the crowd. Qin Guan turned around and waved at his fans, which made the screams get louder.</p><br/><p>\"Bro, we outsmarted ourselves.\"</p><br/><p>\"If we beat him, they will vent their anger on us!\"</p><br/><p>The sports club leader was biting on his nails fretfully. \"Who cares? It\u2019s not our fault if he\u2019s inferior to us!\"</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s beat him! Give him a lesson! We\u2019ll reveal his true colors to his fans.\"</p><br/><p>Making a decision, they walked over to Qin Guan. \"Which sport do you choose?\"</p><br/><p>The handsome guy nodded at them. \"The triple jump.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

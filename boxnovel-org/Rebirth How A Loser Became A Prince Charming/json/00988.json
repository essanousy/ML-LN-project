They became real comrades, which helped the shooting go smoothly.</p><br/><p> Only the producer and the director could sense Qin Guan's mood. As the main sponsor of the show, Qin Guan remained unsmiling when he saw the location expenses, the temporary actors and the military training.</p><br/><p> Winter went away and spring came. The actors were now able to endure hard training, such as carrying wood, shooting, long-distance running, cross-country kayaking and jumping over ground obstacles, without hesitation.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's acting awards didn't amount to much in this case. His talents were nothing before the mud and the rain. All the men had gotten a tan by working under the sunshine. They all looked like a group of plain countryside boys.</p><br/><p> Eventually, Duan Yuhong achieved his goal with Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> As the actor who portrayed the trainer, he had an advantage over him. He didn't need to train personally. When Qin Guan was crawling in the mud, he was in charge of spraying water on him, which he did with a high-pressure hose.</p><br/><p> Kang, who was behind the camera, felt like he could read his mind. He was so happy, delighted, pleased, satisfied...</p><br/><p> He seemed to have realized his lifelong dream.</p><br/><p> Who else has sprayed water on an award-winning actor? Only me! I can die satisfied now.</p><br/><p> As Qin Guan climbed up from the mud desperately, there was only one thought on his mind: Would there be any food in the dining hall?</p><br/><p> The crew relied on the army for its accommodation, so they had to obey the army's rules.</p><br/><p> There were strict regulations on every activity, so the dining hall had its own schedule as well. Unfortunately, the shooting schedule was not fixed. The small shop in the camp was their only hope.</p><br/><p> Instant food tasted terrible to a foodie like Qin Guan, who was eager to have some good dinner after working all day.</p><br/><p> Everyone had come to a tacit understanding. As soon as the director stopped the camera, they rushed to the same destination without even looking at each other.</p><br/><p> The dining hall on Tuesdays was different than it was on other days. There would usually be buns, which were the specialty of the cooking team.</p><br/><p> The cook had to be from North China, as the big buns were so delicious that nobody could deny their lure.</p><br/><p> Plus, they were filled with a meatball! The meatball, which was a combination of pork and spices, was everyone's favorite.</p><br/><p> The buns were there, sitting in their steaming baskets, all white, fat and sweet-smelling.</p><br/><p> The delicious food made everyone ignore any classifications between juniors and seniors. Everyone's eyes were fixed on the buns.</p><br/><p> When the large steaming basket was uncovered, steam immediately filled the kitchen. The oily cook looked like a sculpture of Buddha in a mysterious temple.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan felt much better.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Could you please tell me where Nobita Nobi is? What a mess! I think Gouda must be on his way.</p><br/><p>After that incident, the event proceeded normally. When the finalists were announced, Qin Guan let out a long sigh. His two films had two different goals. One was aiming at the Asian award, and the other at an independent award. Qin Guan himself was not on the list of nominated actors though.</p><br/><p>All the cameras turned to him. He was just as confused.</p><br/><p>What's going on? Have they made a terrible mistake? If he is not nominated, why did the organizing committee invite him to the event?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shot a look at the two directors. Were they messing with him?</p><br/><p>Wang got angry immediately. The invitation she had received had stated that Qin Guan had been nominated for an award at the festival. Is this true? Liars! They invited a superstar by tricking him to add glamour to their ceremony. Now they can publish that Qin Guan has returned to China empty-handed. Liars! What the f*ck... They just wanted to use Qin Guan!</p><br/><p>Wang Liying had the impulse to pull Qin Guan out of the hall. If you want big news, I'll give you a bigger scoop for free! \"The Tokyo Film Festival cheats an award-winning actor. According to the calculations, Qin Guan has lost one million dollars by attending the event...\" Just wait and see!</p><br/><p>Before Wang could bounce up from her seat, the host on the stage announced the most important award of the festival in a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\"The winner of the Asian Outstanding Contribution Award of the 20th Tokyo Film Festival is Qin Guan from China! Let's welcome him on the stage with our warmest applause! I hope our festival will be flourishing just like this young man!\"</p><br/><p>What? Are you kidding? Isn't the Outstanding Contribution Award supposed to go to an experienced actor with countless films in his resume? It's usually awarded to someone who has influenced an entire generation. Qin Guan is only 26 years old. You gave him this award too soon!</p><br/><p>Wang sat back down immediately.</p><br/><p>\"Why did you sit down again? I thought you wanted to pull me away.\"</p><br/><p>\"You misunderstood. I just wanted to fix my dress.\"</p><br/><p>Okay. My agent is a lovely person.</p><br/><p>The two of them stood up and hugged each other. Then Wang stepped back calmly to watch Qin Guan hug everyone else. All the Chinese guests were excited about the result.</p><br/><p>This was not just a mere acting award, but the biggest honor for an Asian actor. It was one-sided recognition from Tokyo. In the future, Qin Guan could even become one of the judges if he wished. He could become a standing member of the judge committee and an important person amid the Asian film circle.</p><br/><p>He was the youngest person to ever win an Outstanding Contribution Award, which was usually the last honor bestowed upon senior actors. That year, the crown was on the head of a rising young actor. The result made everyone rethink the real meaning of the award. Should age be the only criteria? Shouldn't the judges focus on one's artistic contribution?</p><br/><p>Wasn't Qin Guan a unique actor in film history? He had broken the restrictions of region, race, language and background and acted in films produced in different countries.</p><br/><p>His charm, talent and kindness had helped him overcome racial discrimination and various other unwritten rules. His films and performances kept getting better and better.</p><br/><p>He had made so many breakthroughs and faced so many difficulties successfully. That was what real contribution was like.</p><br/><p>He had made the European fashion circle pay attention to an Asian model.</p><br/><p>He had introduced Asian people to Hollywood.</p><br/><p>He had earned a spot in The Times.</p><br/><p>He had made foreigners show interest in China and oriental culture.</p><br/><p>He most definitely deserved the award. His power had made the judges ignore his age.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After the crowd dispersed, the policeman took out his phone in secret with a gentle expression on his face. There were photos of Qin Guan on it.</p><br/><p>\"God...\" The man kissed the screen and put the phone back in his pocket carefully. Love was love, regardless of nationality, race or gender. In that romantic country, there were Casanovas everywhere.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan attended the Gucci press conference. He was not the brand's ambassador, but he had been invited by the organizing committee.</p><br/><p>Top brands held small press conferences before the Fashion Week as a way of testing the waters. Any designs that got a negative reaction would be cut from the formal conference.</p><br/><p>The people invited were all VIPs in the fashion circle. As a top model, Qin Guan had been assigned to different shows as a representative of Chinese models in Milan.</p><br/><p>It was his first time sitting under the stage among the audience. He also had the right to reject or approve a design, which was wonderful.</p><br/><p>The empty chairs around him were gradually occupied by the audience. Some spectators were acquaintances, while others were complete strangers.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea that the people there were all fashion insiders and designers from different countries. Maybe they weren't enjoying worldwide fame, but they were all god-like figures in their own countries.</p><br/><p>Kim Sheji from South Korea was sitting next to Qin Guan. His specialty was designing wedding dresses. On Qin Guan's other side sat Rei Kawakubo, one of the most famous designers in Japan. The two of them were among the top designers in the Asian fashion circle.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt their gazes on him. He could actually answer their questions in both Korean and Japanese!</p><br/><p>This impressed the men a lot. A top designer needed a good modeling team, and a top model had to be good at understanding instructions and performing.</p><br/><p>Even though he was still young, Qin Guan had managed to reach that level in a few years. His talent at languages was evident to everyone around him.</p><br/><p>The designers kept this in mind and considered opening a door for Qin Guan in the future if there was a chance of cooperation.</p><br/><p>Some people were shocked. It was said that Armani didn't speak English, so being fluent in Italian was a must for working as an exclusive model for him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was Chinese, but he also spoke Japanese and Korean. Plus, he was a college student in America, which meant that he could speak five different languages.</p><br/><p>If he was not a model, he would have been considered a genius.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the host announced the opening of the show. The curtain opened and the models started walking on the stage one by one. They were all wearing the sample collection.</p><br/><p>As the show went on, Qin Guan grew more and more serious.</p><br/><p>The models were dressed in luxurious colorful outfits. They all looked gorgeous, but they were made of various types of fur.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan could tell by the stripes and spots on the clothes. A jaguar, a python, a zebra and a snow fox had given their lives for those outfits.</p><br/><p>That year, Gucci had chosen luxurious fur for their new collection. They were a favorite of women and a symbol of talent.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was holding a piece of paper in his hand. It was his feedback for Gucci. The simple questions on the paper were very difficult for him to answer.</p><br/><p>Although he was hated and rejected by animals, the fur on the stage still made him uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had never accepted an offer from a brand that used animal fur. He had even avoided leatherware made of rare animals. On his first night at the Milan Fashion Week though, he saw a whole collection made of fur.</p><br/><p>He didn't know what to say. After the models left the stage, he wrote something firmly down on the paper.</p><br/><p>Sheepskin and cattle hide are enough. Spare those rare wild animals!</p><br/><p>He had a soft heart deep down.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If he opened the door that moment, all the girls would turn their attention to him.</p><br/><p>Wang was really regretting not covering the new car's windows. The transparent glass revealed everything.</p><br/><p>When the girls left the parking lot, Wang opened the door silently. When she saw that everything was alright, Qin Guan got out of the car like a thief.</p><br/><p>He closed the door and then turned around in fear. There were countless actors getting out of their cars around them and craning their necks to peer at him.</p><br/><p>They were all trapped inside their cars. There was also a group of famous comedians, including Feng Gong, Cai Ming, Niu Qun and Gong Hanlin.</p><br/><p>They were all experienced actors who would be performing at the gala. Qin Guan felt like a square peg in a round hole.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! That young man is so handsome! Has he been hired for the gala? Who is he?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. He is wearing sunglasses, so maybe he's from Hong Kong or Taiwan.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, the CCTV staff would have picked him up at the airport. This young man drove here.\"</p><br/><p>His name was popular in the entertainment circle, but the national system was different from the indie cinema industry. In their eyes, Qin Guan was just a young actor.</p><br/><p>What should an honest young actor do when he met actors like them?</p><br/><p>\"Nice to meet you, Teacher Feng! I grew up watching your work!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow, you are so beautiful, Teacher Cai Ming! May I call you sister?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no! I'm not qualified to call you Brother Huang. You are Teacher Huang to me!\"</p><br/><p>A young man had to be humble and honest with older actors, so Qin Guan tried his best to impress them.</p><br/><p>The gala staff led them to different areas.</p><br/><p>\"Actors performing short plays, cross talks and operas, please follow me to Area C.\"</p><br/><p>\"Singers, this way, please. You are in Area D.\"</p><br/><p>Along the long, winding corridor were fitting rooms, lounges, and waiting areas for different people. Dancers were lining up for makeup, and figurants were waiting for their turn. Qin Guan and the group attracted everyone's attention.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! That's Feng Gong and Niu Qun!\"</p><br/><p>\"I know them! My mom loves their performances!\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is that guy? The one wearing sunglasses! He looks so funny!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took off his sunglasses awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" All the senior actors looked scared.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan! I love his films!\"</p><br/><p>Are you sure? Very few of Qin Guan's films have been released in China. You can't have watched them. You just like his looks, don't you?</p><br/><p>The sad older artists turned left, and Qin Guan turned right. He pushed the door open and entered the makeup room. The two people already inside turned in his direction.</p><br/><p>\"How are you? You must be Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"How are you?\"</p><br/><p>It was Yu Chengqing from Taiwan and Xie Tingfeng from Hong Kong, both of whom were big shots. That explained why CCTV had invited Qin Guan to the gala.</p><br/><p>Judging by their heights, Qin Guan knew that he would be standing in the middle on the stage. He would act as a Chinese mascot during the performance. The audience would pay attention to their looks instead of their singing ability.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan held his hand out towards his partners. \"Hello, I'm Qin Guan. Nice to meet you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Likewise. Go to the stylist first. Our act will be among the best. We'll have some time to chat after the rehearsal.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>Work came first and socializing second. Qin Guan rushed into the fitting room.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

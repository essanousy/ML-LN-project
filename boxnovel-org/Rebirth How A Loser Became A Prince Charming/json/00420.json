I heard that he\u2019s on a full scholarship...\"</p><br/><p>\"He is handsome, hard-working and capable at making money. He gave part-time jobs to plenty of seniors...\"</p><br/><p>The loudspeakers beside Zhang were broadcasting Qin Guan\u2019s achievements. Suddenly, Zhang shouted at his assistant, who was carrying a pile of posters and leaflets.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing here? Be smart! Be positive! Distribute the material!\"</p><br/><p>The girl, who was wearing black-framed glasses, got scared. She pursed her lips, as if she was about to cry.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay. Stop! Go to the meeting room and check our budget. I have to invest more!\"</p><br/><p>\"But we do not have much money left...\" she said hesitantly.</p><br/><p>\"Shut up, Liu Tianxia! Do something about the budget! You are in the Accounting Department, aren\u2019t you? You have an auditing certificate, right? I need an extra 500 dollars for my campaign! Go!\"</p><br/><p>Liu ran to the meeting room with tears in her eyes. She was afraid that she might start crying in public. A small robot disappeared in the thickets silently.</p><br/><p>Inexplicably, Qin Guan found himself the focus of the whole campus. Everyone he passed by greeted him.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, miracle boy! I support you!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll vote for you, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>\"Looking forward to your election speech!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt like a monkey in the zoo, surrounded by onlookers. It was stranger than in China.</p><br/><p>He saw people playing a soccer game on the field between the two libraries. The cheerleaders were waving boards with the phrase \"Qin Guan will win\".</p><br/><p>Would the tradition of the cheering team ever change? Those people would cheer for anyone who paid them.</p><br/><p>Hovering above the campus was a sea of balloons. Occasionally, a poor balloon would break away from its owner and drift in the air before it exploded.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw his face get smashed. That hurt! Dear Xu, how much have you prepared for my campaign? It looks like a wedding ceremony!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan saw Xu standing by the cars. The two of them fought playfully. Meanwhile, Zhang's car remained silent.</p><br/><p>In the meeting room, Zhang's face was as dark as the burned bottom of a pan. As he looked at Liu, he tried his best to suppress his rage.</p><br/><p>\"For the last time, Tianxia, help me! You are good at accounting. I only need a little help. The election is in two days. We are working hard for a better future, aren\u2019t we?\"</p><br/><p>\"I know what you are thinking about. You think that without a bright future I will turn you away. I swear that if I am elected chairman, I will reciprocate your true feelings. Help me, Tianxia!\"</p><br/><p>The girl was not stupid. She knew that the man was lying. If he really liked her, he would have confessed his feelings earlier. They had known each other for a long time after all.</p><br/><p>\"I want to think it over...\" She lowered her head, her face hidden behind her long hair. Zhang was hell-bent on winning...</p><br/><p>Outside the window, a flying object that resembled a UFO was on its way home.</p><br/><p>The day of the election came fast. The auditorium was crowded. It was an unprecedentedly gigantic election. During the previous elections, only a few internal members had voted for the chairman. Attracted by Zhang Dekai and Qin Guan\u2019s candidacies, most Chinese students had shown interest in the activity.</p><br/><p>Zhang was excited about the big occasion. The more people voted, the more significant the role of the chairman would be for the University of Columbia, as well as many major companies.</p><br/><p>The hostess was a new member of the union. She was a pretty girl in a cute white dress. She stared at Zhang with blinking eyes and smiled at him from time to time.</p><br/><p>Liu Tianxia watched them with a poker face. She left without a word.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I know. Don't push me. It\u2019s only a speech. Why do I have to dress like this?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was looking down at his formal outfit. He looked as if he was attending a grand banquet.</p><br/><p>Xu smoothed out the wrinkles on his suit. He patted Qin Guan on the shoulder and shouted, \"Come on, my friend! I\u2019ll always be by your side!\"</p><br/><p>The hostess invited the first candidate to deliver his speech. Qin Guan mounted the stage leisurely.</p><br/><p>He knocked on the microphone gently and stood straight, smiling at the audience.</p><br/><p>He was like a wintersweet with red petals and yellow pistils bursting into bloom on its skinny branches. He was like an orchid with a nice smell amid ancient ruins. He was like a lonely bamboo tree on a remote mountain or withered golden asters in a forbidden city.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

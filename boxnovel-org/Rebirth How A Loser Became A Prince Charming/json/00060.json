Qin Guan had decided that except him and Liu Xiaoyang, all the others in his dormitory had really cunning personalities. Qin Guan set his book on the table. Honest students like me are rare these days. (You are already beyond the scope of examination, you show-off!)</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang waved his game console at Qin Guan. \"Do you want to play?\" Qin Guan stood up curiously, only to find Liu Xiaoyang playing Tetris. The console was quite new. He was speechless. \"Isn\u2019t this an old game? Why are you still playing it?\"</p><br/><p>\"I discovered a game secret!\" Liu Xiaoyang answered excitedly.</p><br/><p>\"What is it?\" Qin Guan asked torpidly.</p><br/><p>Liu looked around before he said in a low voice, \"The record can be renewed repeatedly. I\u2019m working on the scores in various ways.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan left him and went straight to the bathroom. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s a genius or an idiot.</p><br/><p>Nothing happened that night.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia entered her examination room on June 27th 1999, at the same time that Qin Guan was taking his own exams. It was an unprecedented exam held at the college lecture theatre. The large room provided many loopholes to take advantage of. All the students tried their best to get a passing mark.</p><br/><p>Some of them had reprinted the material in a smaller format. Without a magnifying glass, Qin Guan couldn\u2019t read it at all, but he admired the eyesight of the people who could.</p><br/><p>Some students had also carved the answers on their desks or drawers in advance. They possessed excellent carving abilities.</p><br/><p>The methods mentioned above were only simple measures the students had taken beforehand, but more striking skills would follow.</p><br/><p>The invigilator was the top hunter in the college. She tutored about Marxism-Leninism. As she was passing out the papers, she reminded the students once again, \"Cheaters will be announced all over university, and their scores will be cancelled. I won't let anybody off.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan watched the boy sitting in front of him shiver and put the books under his bottom away.</p><br/><p>The bell rang, and the exam began. For naughty students, that threat meant nothing. They would risk their own lives to get a passing mark.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan observed the cheaters as he wrote.</p><br/><p>A fat student to his right moved. He pushed the desk and a textbook slid from the drawer and fell onto his legs. He had one hand on the desk to prevent others from seeing while he turned the pages of the book with his other hand. He found the right place and put the answers down on his paper.</p><br/><p>How skillful of him!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished a question and looked to his left, discovering another cheater. The superpower of perspective eyes was hardly possessed by common people. Copying answers off others was a most familiar skill. Cheaters observed carefully the answers of students sitting around them and put them down on their own papers.</p><br/><p>Several students like that had gathered around Qin Guan and Wang Lei. Of course, they didn't copy all their original answers. They would intentionally make some mistakes so their papers wouldn\u2019t be identical.</p><br/><p>After watching them, Qin Guan concentrated on his own paper. It took him only 50 minutes to finish it, while the exam was supposed to take students one hour and a half to complete. He scanned his paper from beginning to end. I\u2019ll get a perfect mark again, no doubt.</p><br/><p>Before he handed in his paper, another girl from his department stood up and handed in her own. Shorty thereafter, Qin Guan saw an apple appear outside the window. It must be that girl!</p><br/><p>Glancing at the boy sitting beside the window, everything suddenly became clear. The two of them were boyfriend and girlfriend and were known around the college for their different interests. The girl was focused on her courses, while the boy was a fan of video games.</p><br/><p>An apple appeared outside the window once again. The boy began to write swiftly on his paper. Qin Guan looked down at his own paper and realized the answers of the first two multiple choice questions were both A.</p><br/><p>When a banana followed, Qin Guan tried his best to keep a straight face.</p><br/><p>Finally, after Qin Guan had waited for a long time, a C appeared. What's that? Again! A chestnut? Chinese people are really talented.</p><br/><p>Not long after, they were discovered by other students. They all could do nothing but watch, as they didn\u2019t know what the corresponding questions were.</p><br/><p>It was an uncopied success. The boy was laughing to himself. Qin Guan compared his answers to the girl's and found that she had made two mistakes.</p><br/><p>When the bell rang, Qin Guan handed in his paper and followed the boy outside the classroom. When he found the couple, the two of them were eating the banana and apple. With an obscene smile, Qin Guan jumped in front of them. \"The answer of the last question was chestnut, not apple. You were wrong!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

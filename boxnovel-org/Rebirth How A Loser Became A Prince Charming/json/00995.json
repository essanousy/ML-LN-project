Thin streams united to form a long river that poured help to the disaster area.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan's team was driving in the traffic that headed to the Sichuan Province. He was moved to see that he was only a member of a bigger group of volunteers.</p><br/><p>At the intersection were the organizers sent by the government. Although they were advancing slowly, everyone still obeyed the rules.</p><br/><p>\"Volunteers? Supplies? Okay, go that way.\"</p><br/><p>The volunteers were talking to each other.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, dude. How's the situation ahead?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's pretty terrible. Take care of yourselves and save as many people as you can!\"</p><br/><p>The first 48 hours after the earthquake were the most important for the survivors. The key was to be as quick as possible. Qin Guan attracted wide attention among the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"He looks really familiar!\"</p><br/><p>\"It must be Qin Guan! The award-winning actor!\"</p><br/><p>\"What is he doing here? Is this a charity act? It's too early for the disaster area.\"</p><br/><p>\"Look at the team behind him! He's brought supplies on demand!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow, he brought his donation here personally. What a kind man!\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, he is rich!\"</p><br/><p>\"Not all rich men were kind enough to do this. Look at the label! That's medicine. It must have cost him a fortune!\"</p><br/><p>More and more people started voicing their positive opinions about Qin Guan. Qin Guan didn't care about their comments, though. He just waved his cap in greeting at the volunteers.</p><br/><p>\"Next one! Come here!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's team moved forward.</p><br/><p>\"Follow our military trucks to the front. Don't fall behind. We are in great need of medicine. Hey! It's you! Brother Qin!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan recognized the military officer. He was the one who had taken him to the dormitory before he had started shooting \"Soldiers Sortie\".</p><br/><p>\"What a coincidence! Fancy meeting you here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Take care, Brother Qin. We are lacking manpower, and there are still some aftershocks going on. You must be aware of the landslides and all other possible dangers.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks!\" Qin Guan smiled. \"You are as reliable as ever.\" The officer blushed.</p><br/><p>\"Cheers! We'll get going now. See you around!\"</p><br/><p>They followed the military trucks ahead.</p><br/><p>The farther they got into the mountains, the more dire the situation became. Fallen trees and rocks served as natural barricades on the roads, and the ground ahead was cracked. Everyone fell silent as they advanced. All the drivers were driving carefully.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the earth started trembling. It was another aftershock.</p><br/><p>\"Look out! Turn off the engine and find shelter!\"</p><br/><p>All the trucks pulled over.</p><br/><p>\"Help\u2026 Help!\" Qin Guan heard a weak voice shouting. \"Do you hear somebody yelling?\"</p><br/><p>\"It seems to come from behind!\" An experienced soldier looked down. \"It must be a local resident! He must be trapped here!\"</p><br/><p>\"What shall we do?\"</p><br/><p>They couldn't just stand by and watch. There was still some distance from the first emergency rescue spot. Fortunately, the team was well-equipped.</p><br/><p>The soldiers started preparing for the rescue. In a few minutes, a soldier climbed down with a rope.</p><br/><p>\"It's two adults and a kid. I'll take the kid first.\"</p><br/><p>The survivors were the owners of a cottage nearby. The parents had escaped with their kid, yet before they had been able to reach a safe place, they had fallen through a deep crack in the ground.</p><br/><p>The kid was saved first. Except for a slight dehydration, he was otherwise alright.</p><br/><p>\"Second one coming!\" The first adult was saved.</p><br/><p>The family's luck ran out while the soldiers were rescuing the second adult.</p><br/><p>\"Another aftershock!\"</p><br/><p>As the soldiers tried their best to salvage the situation, Qin Guan rushed over.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

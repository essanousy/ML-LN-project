With a disdainful expression, Fang Yanyu scanned the famous model.</p><br/><p>The lines of his face were too gentle.</p><br/><p>He had lost too much weight.</p><br/><p>His body-leg ratio was not perfect.</p><br/><p>In Fang's eyes, Shao Xiaobing didn't have a single redeeming quality. He couldn't help but request, \"Could you walk on the stage? Just take a few steps.\"</p><br/><p>Shao\u2019s agent wanted to protest. How dare he ask that! He's contradicting his boss and being picky with my model. I noticed his expression just now! How can he even ask him to walk on the stage? Does he think he's picking chickens in the market?</p><br/><p>Before he could say anything though, Shao Xiaobing smiled and stopped him, answering calmly, \"Okay, shall I walk here?\" Fang Yanyu relaxed his eyebrows slightly as he waited for his performance. Shao took a starting pose, and his agent clapped his hands tacitly. Shao walked to the rhythm.</p><br/><p>He was pretty good for a rising star, but Fang wasn't impressed. He hesitated before he told the boss firmly, \"I insist on my model.\" The boss was completely torn. He was about to shout at Fang, when the designer waved at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed at himself and looked around. Is he talking to me? He approached the group slowly. Everyone saw a smartly dressed childe walk over. Unconsciously, the boss had the impulse to shake hands with him. The model looked super elite.</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu was very satisfied with Qin Guan. He introduced him to everyone, \"This is Qin Guan from New Silk Road. What do you think of him, boss?\" Shao's agent felt grateful that Shao Xiaobing had started his career a few years earlier. That model is superb! Judging by his looks, few domestic models could surpass him. If Shao had started at the same time as him, it would have been hard to tell who the real lucky star would be.</p><br/><p>A good point indeed! The models that had started working at the same time as Qin Guan, especially Ouyang Fen, were weeping silently in a corner.</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu cared about nothing. He asked Qin Guan to walk before the members of the SS Group. Qin Guan had no idea about the status quo, but he doubted that there would be any changes in the show. He just nodded seriously and tried to do his best.</p><br/><p>As he took several perfect steps, silence prevailed. Everyone turned their eyes to the boss simultaneously. The boss was also hesitant. For a green hand, the model was perfect. He was almost convinced by the designer, but Shao was still more famous and influential.</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaoning clenched his fists secretly, but maintained a smile. He murmured something in the ear of his agent. The agent was also hesitant as he murmured, \"It's unnecessary... Fine....\"</p><br/><p>The two of them reached a conclusion. The agent squeezed into the crowd and told the boss something in low voice. The man\u2019s eyes got brighter, and he finally smiled before turning to Fang Yanyu, \"The model you selected is outstanding, but the choice for the main show should be made based on the future development of our group. Shao Xiaobing could promote our brand, so he will be the main show model.\"</p><br/><p>He waved his hand to stop Fang Yanyu. \"That's it. Your model can open the show. That way we\u2019ll be making the best of our resources. You should learn to be flexible, young man.\" Then he told the staff, \"Get ready as soon as possible. Time is pressing. I would like to congratulate everyone beforehand. I\u2019m sure our show will be a successful one and our products will sell well!\"</p><br/><p>Then the boss left with the group, leaving Fang Yanyu and Qin Guan behind. Shao Xiaobing chuckled before bringing the two guys back to reality. \"Shall I change clothes?\" he asked Fang in a friendly tone. \"Is the suit he\u2019s wearing the main show outfit?\"</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu felt a headache building up and pressed his fingers against his temples to stop it. He waved at his assistant and said, \"Ask Ouyang Fen and Li Tianyang to come here.\" The assistant, who had watched the whole dispute, nodded obediently. Not long after, Ouyang Fen and Li Tianyang arrived. Fang didn't explain everything in detail. He just started making adjustments at once. \"Ouyang Fen, you change sequence and clothes with Li Tianyang. Qin Guan, you will open the show instead of Ouyang Fen. Put on Ouyang\u2019s outfit and give yours to Shao Xiaobing. Li Tianyang, go find my assistant after changing out of your clothes and follow his instructions.\"</p><br/><p>Before the unexpected changes, the young models could do nothing but follow Fang\u2019s orders. The sponsors were considered gods. Time was pressing, so they hastened to change clothes. They went into the adjacent fitting rooms and exchanged outfits.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen's suit overall fit Qin Guan. Except for its shorter legs, looser waist and narrow shoulders, the ensemble was fine.</p><br/><p>Who\u2019s laughing at Ouyang's figure?</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen walked out in anger. I went from opening the show to this. I can't walk after Qin Guan. He will cut a dash! He is doomed to be my enemy!</p><br/><p>Li Tianyang was the unluckiest one among them. The assistant told him that he would be a backstage reserve, but his salary would still be the same. At least he wouldn't have worked in vain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

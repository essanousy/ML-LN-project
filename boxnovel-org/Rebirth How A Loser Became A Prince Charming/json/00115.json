It might look unflattering on a customer's figure.\" That dealer was the intellectual type.</p><br/><p>\"As long as the customers like it, it\u2019ll be okay. That suit could attract attention even on a plastic mannequin. Customers will enter the shops.\" That dealer was the realistic type.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! He is definitely a green hand. He\u2019s so handsome! God! He is like a shelf for clothes. I\u2019ll order the maximum amount to give it a try.\" Is that what you call a try? The female dealer was the hyperbolic type.</p><br/><p>The rest of the dealers were speechless. We shouldn't be influenced by such a model. Yet they spontaneously ticked the larger amount rather than their previous estimation.</p><br/><p>Depending on his typical outfit (picture something superheroes wore in movies), Ouyang Fen took advantage of Qin Guan's leading position and got favorable comments from the dealers as well. Integrity promoted sales.</p><br/><p>Fang Yanyu was half-relaxed when Qin Guan returned backstage. It had been a perfect opening. Models came and went one by one as sweat ran on Fang\u2019s palms. The perfect end would depend on the final model.</p><br/><p>He cast a glance at Shao Xiaobing, who smiled back confidently and politely. The model got on the stage as the timer backstage started to count down.</p><br/><p>\"Attention! Five, four, three, two, one, up! \"</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing got on the stage with the count. The lights made his eyes a little uncomfortable. He smiled smartly as he got up, his slender waist swaying to the rhythm. He seemed to be walking on a cloud. He was as light as a feather.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the audience fixed their eyes on him until he disappeared backstage. Before they could decide on a suitable adjective for him, the designer had gotten on the stage, holding the hand of the main show model. The other models got on the stage one by one, clustering behind the designer and leaving the shiniest part of the stage to the backroom hero.</p><br/><p>All the attending dealers and media representatives applauded, signalling the end of the fall collection show of the SS Group. Journalists went to interview the designers, and the dealers stayed behind to discuss their affairs with the SS Group.</p><br/><p>One of them breached the topic first, \"What did you think of the final outfit?\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Do you mean the first one? We have already discussed it.\" The other dealer sounded doubtful.</p><br/><p>\"Are you a green hand? The featured outfit is the final one. The final model is the main show model.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, he should be. I know him. He\u2019s Shao Xiaobing, a rising Vogue model.\" Those dealers were veterans.</p><br/><p>\"It was a traditional suit with creative details. It should do well in the market.\"</p><br/><p>\"But why was there something off about it? It was a little light. It should have given off a sense of capability and experience.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it was too loose on him. Most people could wear that suit.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that's why it seemed strange. It might be popular though.\"</p><br/><p>They had not reached a decision after their discussion. Their pencils were still hovering above the options.</p><br/><p>Backstage, all the models were waiting in line outside the fitting rooms. The first one to use the room had to be the most famous model. In this particular show, it was Shao Xiaobing. When he came out, he smiled at the waiting models. \"You worked really hard, everyone. I hope I\u2019ll get the chance to collaborate with you again.\"</p><br/><p>The other models were glad. Their senior was a kind person. He was polite to them, even though they were mere nobodies. They all replied, \"You are welcome, Brother Shao. It's us who troubled you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that's right.\"</p><br/><p>Shao waved to their sincere smiling faces and left.</p><br/><p>He might have gone away, but his charm was still lingering around. He had made an extremely good impression on everyone. Time and again, they all shared with each other the pleasure of being appreciated by a senior model.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt a little strange, but Ouyang Fen was expressionless. He should have been as proud as a peacock, but Ouyang Fen was not a silly guy. He knew what Qin Guan was thinking about, and he was hesitant to express his feelings. \"I know why you\u2019re laughing at me. Shao is a gentleman, but I\u2019m too scared to get close to him.\"</p><br/><p>Then he shivered. \"It's strange, but I can't make it any clearer.\"</p><br/><p>What an acute animal-like intuition! Sister Xue's eyebrows shot up. Shao seems like the perfect man. If he wasn't kind, he would have been an evil person. Qin Guan is clever. I\u2019ll take care of him.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen felt a little shy as he shared his innermost thoughts and feelings with Qin Guan. By that time, Qin Guan had pulled his pants up to his thighs and entered the fitting room.</p><br/><p>\"Finally, it's my turn. Whose suit is this? The legs are too short, and the bottom is flat. Plus, the pants are too small for me. My balls hurt, and people can see my underwear!\" He wrenched his body around several times.</p><br/><p>The boat of friendship was turned over as blue veins popped on Ouyang's forehead. I shouldn't be soft-hearted with Qin Guan! He\u2019ll be my arch enemy for life!</p><br/><p>Everyone was finished, and the noisy backstage area grew quiet again. All the scattered equipment was arranged in order, and the dealers handed their preliminary orders to the assistant. Fang Yanyu read the first orders and frowned at the difference between the opening and the main show.</p><br/><p>As he touched the tired sockets between his fingers, he let out a long heavy sigh. Those were some unexpected statistics. The main show had had only half the order quantity of the opening show. He had been prepared for the trial of the opening show orders, but the stakes had been placed on the main show. This result was unacceptable to him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Qin Guan's makeup would get washed off in the rain.</p><br/><p>Zhen Zidan returned to his seat with mixed feelings. He was used to his partners being inferior to him during fighting scenes, while he was the inferior one in looks.</p><br/><p>After returning from the US, he had gotten proud and arrogant. His career had taken off in Hong Kong, and he was considered the third best martial artist after Cheng Long and Li Lianjie. He was confident that he would get his dignity back during the next martial arts scene.</p><br/><p>If he had known about Qin Guan's gift and the evaluation of the action director, whom he also respected, he wouldn\u2019t have underestimated Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>After three minutes, the director announced the next scene.</p><br/><p>Despite his bitterness, Zhen made a handsome movement with his shining spear. Qin Guan was stunned. Those movements were in his nature though. His body had the right reaction automatically.</p><br/><p> His bronze sword hit the spear. Qin Gian rotated smartly, as if he was dancing.</p><br/><p> Startled, Zhen Zidan pulled his spear back. That young man is an expert. My sudden attack didn't trouble him. He had the perfect reaction.</p><br/><p>There was no time for him to think it over. Zhen stabbed at Qin Guan's chest. Qin Guan moved his sword back immediately to protect himself. Encouraged, Zhen pushed the spear forward towards Qin Guan again, using his full strength.</p><br/><p>It was terrible. The spearhead began to shake vigorously from his high speed, aiming for Qin Guan's face.</p><br/><p>Zhen was alert. It was his fault!</p><br/><p>His pupils expanded slightly. He was a professional martial artist, so he tried to control the spear with his wrists.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused. The spear should have swept by the side of his face. This was not in the script. His face would get destroyed. There would be holes in it, and his teeth would get knocked out.</p><br/><p> People always had crazy reactions when they were afraid. Only one thought was echoing in Qin Guan's mind. \"Thank god I covered my face and saved my handsome looks.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was about to scream out. Silence prevailed in the studio. Only the camera was still working. Qin Guan moved.</p><br/><p>His muscles pulled his head to the side. It was a real dodge. His twisted mouth made the picture seem alarmingly dangerous. It was an actual fight.</p><br/><p>The silver spear cut the long hair behind his head and a wisp of black hair fell on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took three steps back to steady himself, influenced by Changkong's fierce attack.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang shout calmly, \"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>His voice broke the tense atmosphere on set. Everyone rushed over.</p><br/><p>Zhen Zidan felt sorry about what he had done, but the proud man found it hard to apologize. Picking up the spear, he told Qin Guan, \"Sorry.\"</p><br/><p>Zhen's agent was stupefied. Zhen had never apologized to a nobody.</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhen was obsessed with martial arts. He felt proud next to guys without real skills. If one could convince him, he thought very highly of them.</p><br/><p>Of course, he never took looks into consideration.</p><br/><p>Everyone else dispersed and Sister Xue reached Qin Guan. She checked his face carefully for a long while.</p><br/><p>\"Are you looking for wounds?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan massaged his hurting jaw.</p><br/><p>\"Be careful, Qin Guan! This is your first scene and you nearly got disfigured! Pay attention! Stop laughing! Is he jealous of you or something?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at her doubts. \"Impossible! We are from different domains. I\u2019m not worth his jealousy.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan cast a glance at Zhen and saw the man looking at him. Qin Guan smiled at him and Zhen twisted his face to return a forced smile.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned back to Sister Xue. \"See? It was only an accidental injury.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was used to thinking the worst of people. \"If he found out about your gift in martial arts, he would regret sparing your life,\" she murmured.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan would not be making action movies in the US though.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang shouted at the crew. He wanted to finish the scene that day.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked to a white spot, which marked the actors\u2019 position.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It also serves as a tie among Chinese students that have graduated from Columbia...\"</p><br/><p>\"The structure of the union is outdated. If I was elected president, I would engage in external relations and focus on the employment of Chinese students...\"</p><br/><p>In his convincing speech, Qin Guan spoke about the problem the students were concerned about the most. His style was different from the current working style of the union. Most students knew the name of the president, but had no idea what he had done for everyone.</p><br/><p>Zhang Dekai was getting more and more nervous. He had originally thought that Qin Guan knew nothing about the internal affairs of the union and had paid no attention to its actual functions.</p><br/><p>However, not only did Qin Gian make a perfect analysis on the advantages and shortcomings of the union, but he had also made a good plan for the future, one that was actually much better than his. The loud applause woke him up. Qin Guan had finished his speech.</p><br/><p>\"Now we would like to invite the next candidate to deliver his speech.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang fixed his tie, mustered up all his courage and got on the stage.</p><br/><p>Turning to face the audience, he began his speech.</p><br/><p>\"Some people can give easy promises, but one should actually show the time they have spent working for the union. I have been a member of the union ever since I registered at Columbia. I started my service as a staff member, at the bottom of the pyramid, and invested most of my time in this work...\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a muted video with subtitles started playing on the screen behind him.</p><br/><p>There was a man and a girl in the video. The man was Zhang Dekai and the girl was a sweet junior.</p><br/><p>The camera snapped a picture of the scene. The board on the door behind them read \"Chinese Union of Columbia\".</p><br/><p>The two of them were talking happily. The subtitles were transcribing their dialogue.</p><br/><p>Zhang: Give me a kiss, younger sister.</p><br/><p>Girl: I want a beautiful dress.</p><br/><p>Zhang: No problem. I\u2019ll ask Liu Tianxia for some money from the union expenditure. I\u2019ll buy one for you tomorrow...</p><br/><p>Girl: You clever guy...</p><br/><p>The shape of their mouths was corresponding to the subtitles. Both Qin Guan and Xu Xiaoxiao were shocked. We should just finish the meeting now. There is no suspense about the president anymore.</p><br/><p>The audience held its breath, pretending nothing had happened. That was a really good joke!</p><br/><p>The hall was even quieter than when Qin Guan had been delivering his speech. Everyone\u2019s eyes were fixed on the screen, leaving Zhang to speak excitedly on the stage.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the scene changed. Zhang was reproaching Liu Tianxia by his campaign car. In the next scene, Liu was working on the fake account.</p><br/><p>By then, Zhang had realized that something was going on. He noticed that all the audience was staring at the screen behind him.</p><br/><p>What are they looking at? A blank screen?</p><br/><p>He turned his head around just in time to catch a glimpse of Liu Tianxian and the forms on the table.</p><br/><p>He felt as if he was about to have a stroke. Who did this?</p><br/><p>In a corner, Rongzhi was quickly manipulating a small car with a mini ejector, making it escape as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>The video was cut off suddenly, leaving no time for Zhang to take action. He didn\u2019t even know what everyone had seen before he\u2019d noticed.</p><br/><p>He had lost his voice. He turned his head around again stiffly, only to find the audience looking at him full of anger and contempt.</p><br/><p>Zhang knew he was doomed. He would be facing not just a failure in the election, but also a follow-up investigation. Thank god Liu took care of the account. I can just say I knew nothing about it.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a member of the audience shouted, \"Any other candidates running for president? Any other ideas anyone?\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Qin Guan! Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>The audience was disgusted with Zhang. They were eager for a representative of their own to put an end to that ugliness. Qin Guan was a newcomer in the union, but they hoped that he would work for their benefit.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was elected president for the next semester. His predecessor also felt hatred for Zhang. There were still six months left before he graduated. What would everyone think of him now?</p><br/><p>Standing on the stage, Qin Guan waved his hands down, indicating for the audience to be quiet.</p><br/><p>\"My first task after taking the post will be looking into the dereliction of duty of the second candidate. I will announce the results publicly. In the future, I want to establish an effective supervising system to make the Chinese union as clean as all other college clubs...\"</p><br/><p>The audience applauded again. As Qin Guan talked, Zhang was getting more and more desperate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

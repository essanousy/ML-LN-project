All the attendants were seated, and the crowd gradually quieted down.</p><br/><p>Shao walked to first position. The other model who would be on the stage with him was Ouyang Fen. He would be entering through another entrance.</p><br/><p>The music began and the door was slowly opened. Qin Guan got on stage alone barefoot.</p><br/><p>He looked like an intangible cloud bearing the dreams of the sky, like an illusory city filled with blooming flowers. The angle made his clothes look like they had dropped on Earth from Heaven.</p><br/><p>A man with a beard was crying backstage. He was the designer.</p><br/><p>I made it! I\u2019ll get an invitation to the Milan Fashion Week with the help of the Asian Fashion Man Competition. My dream will come true after all these years!</p><br/><p>Fang Meiya was sitting close to the stage, looking at Qin Guan in appreciation. He was the only man who had escaped her grasp and he looked much more handsome than before.</p><br/><p>Chang Jin had no idea about their backstory. He was concerned about his girlfriend though. He had noticed something strange.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s dangerous! He carefully sized Qin Guan up, but he was beyond his knowledge of beauty. Then he cast a secret glance at Fang, who turned her gaze away from Qin Guan regretfully.</p><br/><p>What is she regretting? Chang Jin\u2019s simple mind stopped thinking. Nature told him that the powerful hunter was not interested in that prey.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished the opening show successfully. He was about to go upstairs to return to the backstage area. Shao Xiaobing was waiting backstage. He was looking through the door at the most prominent place in the auditorium, where his dreams and future would materialize.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan stepped on the stairs and walked towards him. As he watched the king arrive, Shao couldn\u2019t express his feelings with words. He stretched his boots forward slightly. It was like a curious coincidence. A trick only old dogs could spot. Ouyang Fen, who was also about to get on the stage, knew that Shao was deliberately trying to gain the advantage.</p><br/><p>He would be sharing the same foothold with Qin Guan. On the narrow stairs, Qin Guan would either fall off in his effort to avoid him or get stomped by his boots. No matter the outcome, Shao would influence the final show.</p><br/><p> The rage of the big sponsor and the negative comments from all the media on site would be enough for Qin Guan to lose his favorable position in the competition as well as the market in the future.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ouyang Fen moved. He didn't rush up to Shao, but he kicked his supporting leg fiercely.</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\"</p><br/><p>The models behind them had seen everything. Everyone chose to keep silent, except for the models from New Silk Road. Qin Guan's failure would make people lose their confidence in their company.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Fen had become everyone\u2019s savior. The youngest model\u2019s eyes were filled with tears.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who hadn't entered the backstage area, was still thinking about his performance. He had no idea about the accident, or that he couldn't have avoided Shao\u2019s boots. He would have just taken it and accepted the worst outcome.</p><br/><p>Reality turned out to be much nicer though. After the attack, Ouyang returned to his position quickly and went out along with the rhythm. He had only missed two beats.</p><br/><p>After several steps, he caught up with the music again. He was walking up the stairs with resounding steps. He looked like a general.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Shao lost his balance. He rushed out and went down on one of his knees. His head hit the floor before Qin Guan's shoes.</p><br/><p>He was like a loser kneeling before the king. Humiliation flooded his mind.</p><br/><p>\"Wow...\"</p><br/><p>Because of their respect for the show, the audience didn't shout or laugh at his failure. Maintaining his original pace, Qin Guan disappeared backstage. Nothing could stop him.</p><br/><p>Supporting himself on the stairs, Shao stood up with effort. By then, he was 10 steps behind Ouyang Fen. The models behind him were waiting for him to get out of the way.</p><br/><p>The music went on. Shao sped up, trying to catch up with Ouyang.</p><br/><p>He walked forward with a delightful expression. He still noticed the disappointed expression on Fang\u2019s face though.</p><br/><p>No! It wasn\u2019t just Fang. The chief director of Asian Fashion was also looking at him with a disagreeable expression. So were the directors of top Asian brands. </p><br/><p>What? What happened? I can deal with an accident during the show. I can adjust and catch up to the rhythm. Won\u2019t they praise me for it?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The jeans fit his full backside and slender legs well.</p><br/><p>The plaid shirt was tied around his waist. Not an inch of his skin was exposed, yet he looked incredibly sexy.</p><br/><p>\"The style is really\u2026 interesting!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" The assistant understood what his boss meant immediately. \"He is good at everything.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled like a cowboy looking at his beloved girl. His smile was warm and sincere.</p><br/><p>Giorgio Armani smiled. The whole audience was smiling, yet Qingmu felt like crying.</p><br/><p>The reporters were absorbed in thought.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan retreated behind the curtain, getting buried in encouraging embraces and soft pats.</p><br/><p>So this was what professional acceptance was like.</p><br/><p>An old grey-haired man under the stage was watching Qin Guan with tears covering his face.</p><br/><p>The general manager of Miramax Films was wiping his sweat away. He had flown to New York to discuss a movie adaptation with him.</p><br/><p>After arriving at the set location, he had made a call to change the time and place. He was involved in the fashion circle, so he had been invited to the New York Fashion Week.</p><br/><p>Miramax Films had no other choice. He was Chuck Barris after all, the most famous TV producer of the 1980s.</p><br/><p>He was the creator of the earliest TV entertainment programs. Until then, he had only engaged in producing and transcribing American entertainment programs.</p><br/><p>However, being a romantic in nature, he had also written an autobiography about his unique life. Miramax was competing for the rights to adapt it.</p><br/><p>They were under a lot of pressure, as many big Hollywood companies had important projects coming out that year. Considering the ever-shrinking box office earnings, they had to carve a new path out.</p><br/><p>Indie films were their first choice, and they had invested a lot in order to win a prize. George Clooney had actually agreed to star in the film, making them extremely happy.</p><br/><p>Of course, the main problem was getting the approval and rights to an adaptation from Chuck himself.</p><br/><p>The manager was straightforward. \"Mr. Barris, what do you think of our terms?\" he asked Chuck in a gentle voice.</p><br/><p>The handsome old man wiped his tears away with a handkerchief.</p><br/><p>\"They\u2019re alright, but I have my own terms. I want to have a say in the casting. Otherwise, there\u2019s no need to discuss this. This is my autobiography after all. My own life. I don't want to see an ugly actor portraying me on screen. I already found the right actor for you. It\u2019s that beautiful fairy. He looks exactly like me in my prime time!\"</p><br/><p>The manager narrowed his eyes and scanned the old man over. He looked like he might have some West Asian ancestry. When he was young, both his eyes and hair had been black.</p><br/><p>The manager rubbed his face awkwardly. \"This is an arbitrary decision. We have many suggestions for the main lead. Besides, we have a big enough budget to hire famous actors...\"</p><br/><p>Chuck broke in impatiently, \"You are not the decision maker. Ask him to come here. He will stay. He has another show later. Is George the director? Ask him to evaluate my choice. Beauty is good for our health, isn\u2019t it?\"</p><br/><p>The negotiation came to a temporary end. Chuck always did as he wished. He took out his vintage monocle like a naughty boy and watched the next show carefully. It was CK's underwear show. Those sexy legs were definitely worthy of his attention.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn\u2019t know about their fight. When he changed out of his outfit and got ready to leave, he got a short, strange notice from CK. He was asked to go to the CK headquarters after the fashion week.</p><br/><p>The first day of the fashion festival had ended with many conflicting thoughts.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei got an email from Sister Xue about the fashion week. On the computer, Qin Guan looked much better than he had in China. It was deep at night, but she still made an overseas call.</p><br/><p>\"Richard! Yes, it's me. I sent you an email. Did you see the boy? I\u2019m promoting him to be on the next VOGUE. Full inner pages. Front cover would be even better.\"</p><br/><p>The red-haired man nearly had cerebral haemorrhage when he heard his arch enemy.</p><br/><p>VOGUE is not yours! Although he had noticed Qin Guan, he was not a popular public figure in the US.</p><br/><p>A regular advertorial would be enough. It was impossible to arrange such a large layout for him. He had to consider the sales volume of the magazine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

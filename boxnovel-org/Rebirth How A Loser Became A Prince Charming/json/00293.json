Everyone was invisible in her eyes. Jingzi should kowtow in apology in her short skirt on that cold cement.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt pity for the girl. She shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against for her terrible taste. She didn\u2019t commit a crime. This punishment is totally out of line.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan stood up from the bench. The tall boy looked like Triton among the girls. Feeling the change in his pocket shake, he told them, \"Don\u2019t torture them, I\u2019m okay. My president, I\u2019m hungry. I could treat everyone to lunch.\"</p><br/><p>He pointed to the street across from them. It was a narrow road with countless small restaurants. Blue curtains were swaying in the wind, the word \"Ramen\" printed on them.</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" The girls hailed. They thought it was their lucky day.</p><br/><p>They forgot about their enemies and followed Qin Guan, leaving the black girls behind.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome!\"</p><br/><p>It was a small ramen restaurant.</p><br/><p>A couple was busy working behind the long counter. There were several customers sitting inside. Some tough men were drinking saki.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan invited the girls inside. \"Come on in. Just order whatever you like.\"</p><br/><p>Some girls were itching to enter, but Yamaguchi Tsutomu wasn\u2019t moving. She was looking inside with curiosity. One of her bodyguards warned her, \"Miss, the environment and food here...\"</p><br/><p>Yamaguchi Tsutomu gestured to stop him. Then she entered.</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" the other girls hailed as they followed Yamaguchi Tsutomu in.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat by a long wooden table and told them, \"Just order whatever you like.\"</p><br/><p>The restaurant was full, so the bodyguards had to wait outside.</p><br/><p>\"What would you like, please?\" The female owner bent forward from the kitchen counter and pointed at the boards hanging on the wall. \"Tell me when you decide. The menu and prices are right there.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" they answered happily.</p><br/><p>\"I want chicken and roast pork!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019d like some soba noodles, madam!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll have the seafood noodles, thank you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's brain worked rapidly as he heard their voices. One portion costs 700 to 1,000 yen... I have only 5,000 yen left... I forgot my wallet at the hotel...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan read all the boards. That's it! This is the cheapest dish!</p><br/><p>He held up his hand to the woman. \"Excuse me! I\u2019d like some soya sauce ramen!\" It costs only 500 yen!</p><br/><p>\"Okay, soya sauce ramen!\" The honest owner was working busily in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Yamaguchi Tsutomu didn't say anything. She was watching the owner boil noodles behind the counter.</p><br/><p>\"Ms. Yamaguchi Tsutomu, what would you like?\" She came back to her senses and looked down. \"I\u2019ll have the same with you,\" she said.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled and told the woman, \"One more.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, wait a moment.\"</p><br/><p>It had to be an old restaurant, as the owner was quite skilled at cooking. The girls at another table were enjoying their noodles.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! They\u2019re delicious!\"</p><br/><p>The owner smiled at the praise.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry to keep you waiting. Here\u2019s your ramen.\" The woman put a big bowl on the table. The clear soup gave Qin Guan a good appetite. There were dissected boiled eggs, shredded bamboo shoots and nori on the noodles. It was a simple, yet abundant dish.</p><br/><p>\"Ladies first.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed the bowl towards Yamaguchi Tsutomu. Although he was quite hungry, he had to act like a gentleman.</p><br/><p>Yamaguchi Tsutomu never shared anything with others. Taken aback, she gave Qin Guan a quick, small smile.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><br/><p>Qiuye, who was keeping an eye on them, was so shocked that she stopped chewing. Am I dreaming? Did I just see Ms. Yamaguchi Tsutomu smile? Someone pinch me!</p><br/><p>Another big bowl was placed in front of Qin Guan. It was the same ramen with three thick slices of pork.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s chopsticks lingered above the noodles. This must cost more than 500 yen!</p><br/><p>The owner saw his hesitation. \"It\u2019s our treat. You\u2019re the most handsome customer we\u2019ve ever had in our restaurant and the most considerate boyfriend.\"</p><br/><p>\"You remind us of ourselves when we were young. We could afford only one portion of ramen and my husband always asked me to eat first.\"</p><br/><p>The kind woman covered her face shyly. Time had made her youth and beauty fade, leaving only the beautiful memories behind.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you very much.\" Qin Guan picked up the chopsticks as he explained, \"This beautiful lady is my good friend.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

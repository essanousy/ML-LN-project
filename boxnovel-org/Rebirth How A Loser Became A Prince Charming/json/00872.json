Stars were also humans with normal, natural desires. No one liked to live in the spotlight.</p><br/><p>This was an inevitable result of being famous though. One could choose to retire. There were many stars who had been forgotten by the public. Otherwise, one had to face the media and their fans and act completely at ease around them. People with a conscience were frank with others.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Qin Guan belonged in the latter star category. He had created a microblog that reported his activities in real time. One didn't have to write long essays, a few short sentences were enough to attract readers.</p><br/><p>Fashion was as popular around the country as Facebook was in America. Qin Guan warned Lan Jin and He Ming, who were still in America, to invest in Facebook. If the website entered the stock market, they would become billionaires overnight.</p><br/><p>While Qin Guan was mentally travelling in outer space, Cong Nianwei had picked two houses with the professional help of the sales ladies. They were both on the same floor across from each other. They were also the same size and had the same layout, as well as big beautiful balconies.</p><br/><p>If their parents wished to stay in the capital for some time, these houses would be the best choice. The manager didn't waste their time with negotiations. Qin Guan just threw out a golden credit card and his lawyer's business card and then left leisurely. That was how the international award-winning actor dealt with such matters.</p><br/><p>The couple was happy with the deal. On the way home, Qin Guan told Cong Nianwei about his next plans.</p><br/><p>\"Since you have some time off now, will you come to Hong Kong with me? We could take a short trip to relieve our boredom. Plus, we could also attend Nicholas Tse and Cecilia Cheung's wedding.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Are they getting married? They've only been together four months!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, everyone is surprised. Director Ang Lee also wants to meet you in Hong Kong. Shall we take a sweet trip before your director keeps you hostage on that construction site?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei felt embarrassed. The two of them had been in love for eight years, but she kept turning down his marriage proposal. If Qin Guan's joke came true, she wouldn't get married to him before 2008.</p><br/><p>Thus, she decided to comfort her boyfriend by going on this trip.</p><br/><p>Soon, Wang Liying arranged their schedule, adding the trip to Hong Kong.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan reached Hong Kong without notifying anyone. He just wanted to enjoy his girlfriend's company for once.</p><br/><p>His plan did not work though. As soon as they checked in at the hotel, a man sneaked into his room with Wang Liying. The man was wearing sunglasses, a cap and a scarf. That outfit in autumn made one stand out instead of blend in.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not make fun of Tse. He just welcomed the reliable man into his room.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing here? You must be busy preparing for your wedding.\"</p><br/><p>\"I need your help. Are you familiar with the Philippines?\"</p><br/><p>No, I'm not.</p><br/><p>\"I want to book the P island in the Philippines for the ceremony.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are such a rich guy. I know you've been earning a lot these past few years, but you spend money like water. Such a ceremony would cost a fortune!\"</p><br/><p>\"I know that, but Cecilia told me this would be her dream wedding. She wants to get married on a beach under the sunshine. No tourists, no reporters, just the two of us. I want to make her dream come true.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan held his next words back when he saw Cong Nianwei's face. What was he supposed to say? He would never tell Tse his opinion about his miserable marriage.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was an international award-winning actor, so he was able to help Tse by taking advantage of his various social connections. Then he simply gave up on his original plan and decided to go have dinner with Tse.</p><br/><p>Thus, the three of them sneaked away from the hotel.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xu wiped her eyes and then moved on to the next scene, which was an erotic one.</p><br/><p>All romantic films included an erotic scene, especially the ones with playboy protagonists.</p><br/><p>The most aesthetic erotic scene Qin Guan had ever been involved in was shot silently in the old yard.</p><br/><p>Red lanterns were hanging high, and a decadent smell of tobacco was lingering around the room. The bed, which was a mixture of oriental and occidental culture, had red embroidered sheets and a golden continental quilt on it.</p><br/><p>Xu Jinglei was sitting on Qin Guan's thighs with her back turned to the camera. Her clothes were taken off slowly by his slender hands, revealing her thin fair back to the camera. It felt so good to be young...</p><br/><p>The hands she was longing to touch were on her bare back, moving up along her skin before finally pausing at the slim red belt on her stomach.</p><br/><p>Her traditional Chinese underwear showed her desire as Qin Guan's lips smothered her heavy breaths. It was a magical moment. As the two of them hugged each other and fell down on the bed, the room went dark and the conservative erotic scene ended.</p><br/><p>Most of the crew members were women. Wang Liying, who was one of them, was finally experiencing her boss' unparalleled charm and attraction. Wang's eyes hardly ever shone like this. It was a pity that taking pictures on the set was forbidden. Otherwise, she would have taken some photos for his firm and blog.</p><br/><p>Now all she could do was search for delicious food for her boss.</p><br/><p>The shooting went on smoothly. In a few days, their work in Tianjin was finished and they headed to the last exterior shooting location, which was Huanglongxi Town in Chendu.</p><br/><p>The buildings of that particular era were well-preserved there, and the mountain city was famous for its beautiful landscape, warm residents and delicious Sichuan Cuisine.</p><br/><p>The most important scenes of their romantic affair would be shot there. It would be a wild romance set during troubled times.</p><br/><p>To avoid the chaos of war, the military and political center of the area had been moved to the city. Meanwhile, the rulers continued to lead luxurious lives.</p><br/><p>Xu Jinglei had come to the city to live with a boy Qin Guan did not know. Her lover had abandoned her after spending a few crazy nights with her. The only way a beautiful, lonely woman could survive amid such chaos was by selling her body.</p><br/><p>There were all kinds of ways to sell oneself. The most unwise women sold themselves at low prices, while the most clever ones acted much more nobly. Xu Jinglei had found someone to help her in Sichuan, a young promising squadron leader called Huang Jue, who didn't detest her son.</p><br/><p>He was even planning on marrying her to protect her and the boy, when she suddenly met that man again.</p><br/><p>It was that playboy who had passed through the foolish woman's life and left a mark.</p><br/><p>Xu attended the luxurious ball in a splendid dress, the flowers blooming on her breasts expressing her love for him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the most handsome man at the ball. He was wearing a grey waistcoat, a fancy white shirt and a golden chain watch. His white gloves made him look really handsome.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's eyes were attracted to the most beautiful woman in the hall. Eight years had passed since they had last met, but her blooming beauty attracted him immediately.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he didn't recognize her.</p><br/><p>As the woman sat in a quiet corner, a match lit the slender cigarette in her hand. The camera recorded the final lines between the hero and heroine, not missing even the slightest detail.</p><br/><p>\"When can I see you again?\"</p><br/><p>\"Anytime you like.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan caressed his jaw and leaned his head slightly towards Xu. He was flirting with her, but there was nothing aggressive about him.</p><br/><p>Thus, the man started spreading his poison amid the decadent music of the time and the delighted toasts taking place around them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

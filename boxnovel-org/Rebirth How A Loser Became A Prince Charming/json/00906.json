People were discussing passionately the erotic scenes between the actors. Most men only focused on Tang Wei's boobs though.</p><br/><p>The female audience was much crazier and braver than those wicked men. They used photos of Qin Guan's naked chest as their screensavers. Thanks to the internet, they were able to search for the full version of the film in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The short version had aroused their interest.</p><br/><p>Chinese people preferred things to be partly concealed, so the film's nudity became the hottest topic online, overshadowing all other big news. Photos and videos of it went viral immediately.</p><br/><p>Tang Wei became widely known, surpassing even Qin Guan's fame. She was suddenly considered a pioneer of sexual liberation. She had finally succeeded and attracted the attention of the SARFT in the process, which was good for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan let out a long sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>As soon as he entered his office though, he got a call from the SARFT.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, is this Mr. Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is the movie-approving department of the SARFT. I would like to confirm whether the gossip online is true. Did you violate your original application during the filming process by shooting overly erotic scenes?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>\"Did Director Lee ask the actors to shoot realistic scenes for the sake of shock value or the plot itself? Did you have more intimate physical contact with the heroine than necessary?\"</p><br/><p>That's a good question. You might as well ask me if we had sex.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had to clarify the issue. He was not an adult film actor after all.</p><br/><p>That question insulted both the director's professional ethics and Qin Guan's profession.</p><br/><p>Thus, Qin Guan said seriously, \"Absolutely not! I would never do that. I'm a professional actor and a moral man. I have my limits. If you do not believe me, please give me half an hour so I can prove my innocence.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" The girl on the other end of the line couldn't remain calm any longer. After a short silence, she lowered her voice and said, \"I'm a fan of yours, Qin Guan. I believe you. Can I know how you will prove your innocence? Do you have any video evidence? Has Ang Lee threatened you?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled.</p><br/><p>\"I would like to keep it a secret for now. If you want to find out, try checking my microblog.\"</p><br/><p>Then he hung up.</p><br/><p>You have gone too far, SARFT!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not want to clarify the issue because of the SARFT's investigation or for Ang Lee and Tang Wei. He cared more about his family. A happily married man would never do that!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan called Wang Liying and Sister Xue immediately and discussed his marriage and the gossip online. The two women did not object to his decision.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

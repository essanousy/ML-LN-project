The director went pale, but Qin Guan smiled.</p><br/><p>He was familiar with Lv Opera.</p><br/><p>Lv Opera, which was also called Yang-Chin with makeup and Chin Opera, was one of the eight most famous Chinese operas and a very popular opera in the Shandong Province.</p><br/><p>The actors spoke with a local accent, so the elderly loved it. Compared to Peking Opera, Lv Opera was much closer to life. Everyone in the Shandong Province could understand the lines easily.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's knowledge of Lv Opera had not come from Teacher Rong. Although she was a history professor, she couldn't understand the Shandong dialect. He had actually learned everything from his grandpa, an old man who knew a lot about folk art.</p><br/><p>His grandpa had always liked immediate pleasures, so his own grandfather, who had been a strict man, hadn't liked him very much.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's grandpa led a cozy life with plenty of hobbies. When Qin Guan would stay with him during summer vacation, they would play a different game every day. They would never play the same game a second time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had learned about Lv Opera from him. When he had been a child, his grandpa had set him down in his lap and waited for the opera to begin with a dish of sunflower seeds and a pot of tea next to him.</p><br/><p>The original music, plain makeup and bright costumes had been imprinted in Qin Guan's memory. The two old men had just reminded him of them.</p><br/><p>\"Lv Opera? No problem!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked, except Wang Xiaoya, who shouted confidently, \"Yeah! I told you Uncle Qin could do anything!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's friends in the auditorium fell silent. What the hell is Lv Opera?</p><br/><p>They had no idea, even though they were natives. Qin Guan took off his coat happily. \"Where is the dressing room? Is there a professional stylist?\"</p><br/><p>The two older actors shot a supercilious look at him. \"This group tours the countryside. Of course there's no stylist! The actors have to be self-sufficient. The older generation could always do its own makeup!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was happy to hear that. \"No problem. Today I'll show everyone what I can do!\"</p><br/><p>Then he walked to the backstage area slowly, leaving the two old men to look at each other in shock. Will he perform a Lv Opera?</p><br/><p>There were not that many people backstage, so Qin Guan picked a vanity with a mirror.</p><br/><p>Modern cosmetics were easier to use than traditional ones. Qin Guan applied Vaseline and liquid foundation to his face, and then brushed some blush on his cheeks and drew black lines around his eyes.</p><br/><p>When the prop masters rushed to the backstage area, Qin Guan had already finished his eyebrows and eye makeup and was rummaging through an old case.</p><br/><p>He was looking for a tool used for touching up makeup during the break.</p><br/><p>Water was flowing in his eyes. His face looked like white jade, and his red lips were as bright as roses. No words could express his elegance.</p><br/><p>Decades ago, a Xiaosheng [1] with Qin Guan's face could attract rich women from all over the country. The crew members around Qin Guan felt secretly grateful for the monogamous rules of New China.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan finished his makeup, he started to put on his costume.</p><br/><p>\"I have decided what I will do, Master Zheng. I will perform 'Watching Lanterns', the five-minute Xiaosheng solo. It's perfect for a TV broadcast.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone, including the cast and crew of other acts, took a seat under the stage. They were curious about what the superstar would do. The director confirmed that all six cameras were in place before he gestured at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Lv Opera was called Chin Opera for a reason. Its background music was composed only by chin and pipa.</p><br/><p>After one minute of background music, Qin Guan walked on the stage at a lively pace.</p><br/><p>Yes, lively. Very lively, indeed. Lv Opera was very close to life.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing white leg wrappings and black cloth shoes, which looked very different from the thick-soled Peking Opera boots. He was even able to take a few leaps.</p><br/><p>[1] Young men in Chinese operas.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Class of 2001!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm a senior at the Accounting Department. Class of 2000!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan marched on. Every person he looked at would shout out their identity like a soldier.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan realized it was impossible and unnecessary to hide his face from his fellow students, so he took off his white cap and smoothed down his hair.</p><br/><p>Loud cries broke out.</p><br/><p>\"You are so handsome!\"</p><br/><p>\"You are really a superstar!\"</p><br/><p>Mou, who was standing at the end of the line, was so excited that she left a handprint on the iron pole. It was more than a year since they had seen each other last. The boy walked over slowly with the same smile he was wearing in her dreams. He was her first love.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia scolded her.</p><br/><p>\"Calm down, please! He is not a panda in a zoo!\"</p><br/><p>\"You cried just as much when he left...\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Mou noticed that Qin Guan had reached the end of the line.</p><br/><p>\"He is coming!\" The iron pole made a cracking noise.</p><br/><p>\"Where? Where is he?\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia turned into the passionate young girl she had been at the age of 16. She turned around and saw the boy she used to be in love with. </p><br/><p>He was a short distance away, and yet they seemed miles apart. Her eyes met his.</p><br/><p>How are you getting along?</p><br/><p>I'm okay.</p><br/><p>They nodded at each other without saying a word. The familiar expression in their eyes made them feel as if they'd gone back in time.</p><br/><p>Crack! Mou had broken the chain behind the railing.</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry! Let's go, Qin Guan! I'll help you with your luggage!\"</p><br/><p>The students clustered around Qin Guan and left the terminal orderly.</p><br/><p>The hall was quiet once again. If it was not for the broken chain, nobody would have known what had just happened.</p><br/><p>\"Shall we stop them?\" a young security guard asked his superior. \"They destroyed public property after all.\"</p><br/><p>His superior set the railing back as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>\"It's no big deal, young man. Chains require maintenance. They tend to break after long use.\"</p><br/><p> \"Only an idiot would try to stop that girl...\" he murmured to himself.</p><br/><p>The group of students went out in a formidable array. The other celebrities finally saw the face of the person who had embarrassed them.</p><br/><p>\"It's Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Agents had to pay close attention to all the rising stars in the entrainment circle.</p><br/><p>\"He is the man who was hindering your career in China. We are lucky that he moved to America, or your fame would have been inferior to his.\"</p><br/><p>The female agent let out a long breath as she watched Qin Guan and his team walk over. He had a perfect figure, and his jeans and hoodie complimented his long legs and slender waist.</p><br/><p>The splendid smile on his face looked dazzling in the sunshine. The agent felt the impulse to cover her eyes.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was standing in the middle of the two groups, looked around, revealing his white teeth.</p><br/><p>\"Hi!\"</p><br/><p>The F4 were smart boys. Following the rules in Taiwan, they bowed before Qin Guan politely. Their agent didn't want their imposing demeanor to take a hit, but she knew that the four boys were not equal rivals of a man with two Best Actor Awards.</p><br/><p>She had to obey the rules.</p><br/><p>The Koreans were not as tame though. They tended to bully the weak and fear the strong. Judging from Qin Guan's Armani and Rolls Royce advertisements, they believed that Qin Guan had powerful connections.</p><br/><p>He had also won two out of the three European awards, so Pei's commercial value and professional status were inferior to Qin Guan's.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a few seconds, Pei's agent stretched both his hands out.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, I'm Piao Changqu from the BF agency in South Korea. It's an honor to meet you. I'm looking forward to cooperating with you in the future...\"</p><br/><p>He tried to create an opportunity out of their accidental meeting.</p><br/><p>Actually, the modeling industry had been going the wrong way since the very beginning. Fake faces couldn't prevail for long.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan retracted his hands politely when the bus pulled up to the curb. The large bus with the university logo departed fast.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhang cried out, pointing to Qin Guan\u2019s hiding place.</p><br/><p>\"There they are!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\" He took a bullet in the leg and started shouting and rolling around on the floor. Are you blind? I\u2019m too far away from them. Why did you shoot at me?</p><br/><p>\"Traitor! I\u2019ll find them myself! Ha ha! Qin Guan, this is your friend. Push Xu out, and maybe I will let you go...\"</p><br/><p>With the gun in his hand, Kuhn strode over in their direction without a pause. Xu Xianxiao and Qin Guan exchanged a knowing glance.</p><br/><p>Kuhn was approaching. His long shadow was visible on the floor next to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Now! Lifting up the wooden table top, Qin Guan covered his upper body and rushed out without hesitation like a brave Minotaur.</p><br/><p>For the clan!</p><br/><p>Little did Kuhn know that there was a counter-attack coming. He fired again.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a single gunshot was aimed at the ceiling. Xu rolled out from the other side and grabbed Kuhn's legs, pushing the crazy man off balance.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Kuhn fell and hit the floor, the gun flying out of his hand. \"Here... Sir!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei had run back, out of breath. Her nurse uniform had gotten torn. In two minutes, she had reached the nearest police station. The gunshot had been too loud to be heard in the noisy campus. Without Cong Nianwei's warning, the policemen would still have been searching.</p><br/><p>\"Hands up!\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck!\"</p><br/><p>Kuhn wanted to stand up, but he was pressed against the floor. His hands were tied.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll call my lawyer! Do you have any idea who my father is?\"</p><br/><p>Nobody could rescue him now. Before getting into the police cruiser, Kuhn looked back at his arch-enemy angrily.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was holding her high heels in her hand. Barefoot, she saw her boyfriend smiling at her like a European knight.</p><br/><p>\"Cong Nianwei?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t your feet hurt you? Put on your shoes, or they will think you are a victim of domestic violence.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\" Cong Nianwei was not as nervous.</p><br/><p>The ambulance arrived. The policemen were taking eyewitness testimonies. This was another shocking event after 9/11. The security guard, who had been wounded seriously, had been sent to the hospital. The Barnard party had to come to an abrupt end.</p><br/><p>It was early in the evening, but nobody was in the mood to have fun. Xu and Qin Guan were standing by the entrance. The smell of blood was still lingering in the air.</p><br/><p>\"Shall we continue?\"</p><br/><p>\"You want to go to another party? I don\u2019t. Could you take us back to our apartment?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed at Cong Nianwei\u2019s turned back. \"Her feet are a little bruised.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem.\" They returned to his car. We should buy a car as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>The street was deserted at the time. All the kids had gone back home.</p><br/><p>Saying goodbye to Xu, Qin Guan carried Cong Nianwei out of the car. Before he could close the car door though, Qin Guan's pant leg was seized by a hand.</p><br/><p>\"Cough, cough... Help me!\"</p><br/><p>A man was lying on the grass beside the building. He was covered in blood.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly turned serious. He put Cong Nianwei down. Xu craned his neck to see the man.</p><br/><p>\"Be careful, sir!\" the driver reminded him carefully. The man looked awful.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan squatted down. \"Shall I call the police? Or maybe an ambulance?\"</p><br/><p>The hand on him tightened. The man shook his head slowly. \"No... You do it!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he looked up like a wolf. Under his body was a gun. He pointed the gun at Qin Guan's chest.</p><br/><p>It was actually an Asian gun. When he saw Qin Guan clearly, he looked disappointed. \"You are not a real doctor? Don\u2019t call the police. Do as I tell you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Han Zhujiu?\" Xu shouted.</p><br/><p>Han Zhujiu glanced at Xu. An acquaintance! He\u2019s a member of the Xu Family!</p><br/><p>\"Childe Xu, great! Help me!\" The man looked seriously wounded, but his hand was firm on the gun. He noticed that everyone was looking at Qin Guan. So that young man is calling the shots?</p><br/><p>The resolute man wanted to say something threatening. Qin Guan cast a glance at Xu Xiaoxiao. \"Save him. I know you can!\"</p><br/><p>Xu grinned. \"Actually, I wanted to negotiate with him. But since you already decided, I will help him for free.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded and took off his white gown. They couldn't carry the man to their apartment for fear that their landlord would see him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

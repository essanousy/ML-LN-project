If you look down upon the university theater club, I could recommend you to the actor union on Broadway.\"</p><br/><p> \"Large theaters have strict regulations, but if you pass the test of the union or get approval from famous actors in the circle, you\u2019ll do great things on Broadway.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan shook his head at Wendy\u2019s kind words. Although Broadway played an important role in the entertainment circle in the US, it was only a small part. Considering their limited audience, both musicals and dramas were in an awkward position.</p><br/><p> Besides, long-term rehearsals and tours did not fit in Qin Guan's schedule.</p><br/><p> Out of respect for Wendy, Qin Guan didn't try to mess with her. He gave her a detailed explanation instead.</p><br/><p> Different people had different aspirations. Wendy loved Broadway, but she would never force others to love it. The reasonable girl gave up her plan to convince Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Xu Xiaoxiao left, ignoring the light in Wendy's eyes.</p><br/><p> Xu was a cunning guy though. Although he had an idea about Qin Guan's plan, he thought Qin Guan shouldn't let that chance go so easily. He tried to explain the benefits to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Being a member of the theater club was a unique experience.</p><br/><p> \"Hey, dude! Don't be silly. You\u2019ll be an important member of the club. You are even better than the students from the Art Department. It will be a rich experience that will get you offers from big companies in the future. You shouldn\u2019t say no to that.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan grinned at Xu. \"Who cares? I\u2019ll return to China after I graduate.\"</p><br/><p> Xu was astonished by his splendid smile. He followed Qin Guan, thinking of the old photos his grandfather often caressed in his spare time. \"Is China really that good?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan nodded firmly. \"Of course. It is perfect!\"</p><br/><p> \"We have the financial center in New York, there\u2019s Hollywood in Los Angeles, and the iron planes in Seattle.\"</p><br/><p> \"We have everything in China. We also have nothing. You have to experience it yourself. I\u2019m inviting you to China. You should come to my home court.\"</p><br/><p> Xu fell silent. He secretly decided that he would go to China someday. I\u2019ve heard that Chinese people can't even afford tea...</p><br/><p> Time passed peacefully. Qin Guan had gotten used to the homework by now. He was leading a regular life.</p><br/><p> The routine tests would be over at 12:00 every day. Then the papers would arrive in the afternoon. Qin Guan was fully prepared, so he saved a lot of time each day.</p><br/><p> He decided to execute his plan in Manhattan. It was not his fault he would have to work part-time one month after arriving in Manhattan.</p><br/><p> They spent 3,000 dollars a week, and it cost a week\u2019s wages for Cong Nianwei to have a haircut on Times Square.</p><br/><p> She didn't ask for a lot. She simply cut her hair shorter. Qin Guan couldn\u2019t help but use the word \"f*ck\" to describe the prices in New York.</p><br/><p> John invited Qin Guan to the LEE headquarters in Kansas. Thanks to his recommendation, the designer had sent an invitation to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> After checking his schedule, Qin Guan apologized to John. \"I have only one day off in October. Your launching event will still be in the early stages. I have no time for that.\"</p><br/><p> John roared angrily, \"This is about your future development! I have made so much effort to get you this chance! New York Fashion Week will take place in late October. It\u2019s among the top four international fashion weeks. If you get that chance, you won't need to go to f*cking auditions!\"</p><br/><p> \"You are an Asian stranger in New York. Nobody will be interested in you!\"</p><br/><p> Unconsciously, Qin Guan recalled the old professors back at his college. If they knew that their best student skipped classes for a part-time job, they would hang him upside down.</p><br/><p> Sometimes, giving up was necessary. Qin Guan took a long breath. \"John, I started my career from being a nobody. I\u2019ve been to auditions before. Why couldn\u2019t I do it again? You know how strong I am. Believe in me! I\u2019ll see you at New York Fashion Week.\"</p><br/><p> Then he hung up, feeling very ambitious.</p><br/><p> John looked at the silent receiver, grinding his teeth. He was at a bar, and the phonograph was playing soft music. A girl in a short skirt smiled at him.</p><br/><p> \"May I treat you to a glass of wine, honey?\"</p><br/><p> In the flirty night, John temporarily forgot about his Asian fairy.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan prepared his resume and sent his homework to Prof. Martin. He wondered if there was a place for him on Times Square, where the most designers and clothing companies gathered from all over New York.</p><br/><p> New York gave the impression that it was the center of finance and press. Actually, that was only part of the truth. The city had important ports, but it was also the largest fashion center in America.</p><br/><p> That contradicting combination was perfectly embodied on Times Square and Chelsea Street.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

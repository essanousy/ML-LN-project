He was wearing a formal outfit designed and tailored personally by GIN, the winner of the fourth season of \"Project Runway\".</p><br/><p>The lucky winner had gone to Venice as Qin Guan's temporary fashion advisor. He was also given the chance to learn from Armani's designers.</p><br/><p>This was every designer's dream. Plus, the event would be covered by every fashion magazine in New York. Although it would probably be published in a small corner, this was a rare chance greenhands only got once in a blue moon.</p><br/><p>NBC had also sent reporters to Venice to boast about the news. They would shoot a short video of Qin Guan at the Venice Film Festival for promotional purposes.</p><br/><p>As soon as the New York Fashion Week ended, NBC would broadcast the program and promote it aggressively.</p><br/><p>\"This is the secret guest of the fourth season.\"</p><br/><p>\"The New York Fashion Week is a feast for supermodels.\"</p><br/><p>\"The private fashion party gathered a selection of the most amazing designers.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's all worship Qin Quan and Tim!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Tim stood shoulder to shoulder and told the camera together, \"We are ready for the fourth season. What about you?\"</p><br/><p>Most American viewers would watch that silly clip when they turned on their TVs. They all loved funny and dramatic promotional videos. Even the upper-class citizens living on the Upper East Side, who only watched the financial news and current affairs, stopped flipping through channels.</p><br/><p>More and more people fell in love with the show thanks to its tight schedule, Qin Guan's brilliant presence and Tim's fame. It was not a hasty project. They had even hired an award-winning actor.</p><br/><p>When the news about Qin Guan's participation in \"Project Runway\" was released, his fans in China were annoyed.</p><br/><p>\"Great! We can watch the show in Hong Kong.\"</p><br/><p>\"Some Japanese TV stations have bought the broadcasting rights.\"</p><br/><p>\"So did some South Korean ones. The show might be broadcast a little later, though.\"</p><br/><p>The Chinese, who did not like to watch other people celebrate, came up with all kinds of strange ideas.</p><br/><p>\"If I install a better antenna, will I be able to receive signal from other countries?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't think that would work.\"</p><br/><p>\"We could share our resources online. American people like to record some classic shows on tape.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, we could ask someone to send the episodes through the internet.\"</p><br/><p>\"I speak English well. I could create subtitles for everyone...\"</p><br/><p>\"Isn't that illegal?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea, but we definitely won't make profit from it.\"</p><br/><p>The topic was changed automatically to Venice to push away all evil thoughts.</p><br/><p>When Venice was mentioned, most people thought of boats and bridges. However, Qin Guan's fans had a different reaction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

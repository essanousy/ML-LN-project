At the beginning, it had been just about promoting simplicity over extravagance, but people had gradually given it a more profound interpretation.</p><br/><p>The name combined two different meanings. One could find both modern patterns with simple, smooth lines and complicated vintage clothing at their store. Their brand offered everything one would expect.</p><br/><p>QC had found a large building in Wangfujing that they could use as a private design studio. The small studio inspired the ambition of Qin Guan's design team, whose work was printed on posters in the building. The feedback of the market was essentially the sales volume.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Qin Guan's influence in the fashion circle, their brand had its own agents in dozens of cities even before opening for business.</p><br/><p>On a September day in 2005, their clothes were placed on the counters of different malls in different cities.</p><br/><p>The grand opening ceremonies were magnificent. Their agents had collaborated with the local media to organize big events. Some rich agents had even rented all the mall business exhibition halls to hang Qin Guan's posters. From then on, Qin Guan started occupying all levels of the fashion market.</p><br/><p>The grand events shocked other brands, such as Baoxiniao, Seven Wolves, Shanshan and so on, who had no idea what the new brand would be like.</p><br/><p>What will this mysterious brand be like? What about their prices? Do they have any special promoting skills? Who will be their potential customers?</p><br/><p>All this information had been kept secret until 10:00 a.m. that day. Qin Guan cut the ribbon of the shop in Wangfujing, and then all the chain stores opened one after the other. The audience could watch the opening ceremonies of other cities on a large screen by the entrance.</p><br/><p>The flagship store took up a full 800 square meters in Wangfujing. This was considered luxurious in that area, as an inch of land there was worth an ounce of gold.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had invited all his friends from the fashion and entertainment circle to the ceremony, which was a lot like a press conference of a top brand. The LESS/MORE logos printed on the background were all striking, and his friends shocked the media even more.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had used public office for private benefit. He had gotten his renowned models to attend the ceremony wearing clothes made by his own brand. Although the reporters couldn't recognize them all, the clothes were still sparkling before their eyes.</p><br/><p>Huayi had also sent Li Bingbing and Fan Pingping. The two flowers were the best actresses of the company. Du Chun, Xu Zheng and Wang Baoqiang stood behind them. Their status in the entertainment circle was less significant.</p><br/><p>The event was too grand for an opening ceremony, but it seemed that the award-winning actor had good social connections.</p><br/><p>The decorated baskets were arranged in order by the entrance. The names on the baskets attracted the attention of the reporters.</p><br/><p>Sixth-Generation Directors: Zhang Yang, Ning Hao, Lu Chuan</p><br/><p>Famous Directors: Zhang Yimou, Feng Xiaogang, Zhang Jizhong, Yin Li, Hu Mei...</p><br/><p>Actors: Zhang Xueyou, Wu Junru, Zeng Zhiwei, Zhou Xun, Jiao Huang, Chen Baoguo...</p><br/><p>Wang Liying was a good girl. Before leaving the crew, she had sent invitations to all the actors. She didn't actually expect them to attend, but a basket was enough for her.</p><br/><p>Huayi and \"If, Love\" would collaborate with Qin Guan again, and all sixth-generation directors were longing for his presence.</p><br/><p>Starlets from all sides started gathering around the site. An appearance before the cameras was all they were after.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

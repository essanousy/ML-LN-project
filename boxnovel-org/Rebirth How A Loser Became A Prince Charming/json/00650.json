Gambling Strategy</p><br/><p>Translator: Lan_ Editor: Efydatia</p><br/><p>The man shot a proud look at his own tray, where the coins were getting fewer and fewer. He felt sad about his luck, but he was suddenly startled by the cry of the Asian man.</p><br/><p>\"Ha! I won!\"</p><br/><p>Coins were pouring out of the machine as Qin Guan squatted down and stuffed them in his pockets. When both his pockets were full, he took a coin out and kept gambling.</p><br/><p>\"Beginner's luck\u2026\" the man murmured to himself jealously. He pushed the button angrily, but got nothing in return.</p><br/><p>The guy next to him shouted happily, \"Ha! I won again!\"</p><br/><p>He couldn't help but crane his neck towards the Asian man. \"Hey, dude. How much did you win?\"</p><br/><p>\"60 dollars in total!\"</p><br/><p>The strong man rolled his eyes and pulled a trick that was useful for beginners.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know the first law of slots?\"</p><br/><p>\"What's that?\"</p><br/><p>\"The probability of winning decreases after two winning rounds. See? Everyone is changing machines!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took a look at the other gamblers, who cooperated with the man. They were all frequent patrons of the casino.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan expressed his appreciation for the man's advice. \"Thanks, bro. Without your help, I would have lost everything. You saved my motel money!\"</p><br/><p>The man handed him a box kindly.</p><br/><p>\"Take it. The security here is good. You can change your coins to bills at the reception.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, thanks a lot!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan threw his coins into the box and left for another row of machines. When he disappeared from view, the man grinned and took his seat.</p><br/><p>It was said that there was always a lucky slot machine in every casino. If one was able to find it, they would win dozens of times in one night.</p><br/><p>The man believed that myth, so he threw a coin into the machine and pressed the button nervously. He heard the crisp sound of coins, but nothing came out.</p><br/><p>All the gamblers fixed their eyes on the machine pouring out coins. It was the Asian man again.</p><br/><p>He must have won more than 100 dollars. Qin Guan could not even hold the money in his hands, so he changed it into 200-dollar chips. Considering his initial capital, he could afford to play some more games.</p><br/><p>Black Jack was a very popular card game in Western countries. The players compared the sum of their cards to the banker's. Because of the limited cards in each player's hand, the players could apply statistics to the game and fight the banker by using their good memory.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan did not want to abuse his luck at the casino, but he liked playing and studying, so he sat by the table of a blond dealer.</p><br/><p>The dealer looked up and saw an Asian man in ordinary clothes. If it was not for his handsome looks, he would have seemed like a common visitor.</p><br/><p>When he saw the Asian man take out a five-dollar chip, he was left speechless. He must be a poor man. He is no star or VIP.</p><br/><p>Feeling at ease again, the banker glanced down at his own cards and then at Qin Guan's nervous expression. The Asian man shifted his eyes between the cards on the table and his own hands. As an experienced dealer, he knew that the greenhand had 17 points and was considering whether to ask for more cards or not.</p><br/><p>He was right. After a few seconds, Qin Guan suppressed his desire for more cards and threw his cards into the pile. He quit the round.</p><br/><p>The dealer swiped the chips away calmly. That might have been a lot of money for the guy, so he threw a 10-dollar chip on the table.</p><br/><p>As expected, he lost again.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan banked out his leftover chips, which were worth 185 dollars. The dealer looked at him mercifully. Young men are always so excitable.</p><br/><p>The dealer had 20 points in his hand. The young man had the same expression on his face, yet this time he did not hesitate to ask for a third card.</p><br/><p>\"One more?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head hard.</p><br/><p>\"No\u2026 Show me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan won, 21 to 20.</p><br/><p>The odds had been 1 to 2. His chips had now been doubled.</p><br/><p>Dear everyone, here is the new book of Kiki, my lovely editors.

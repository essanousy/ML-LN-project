A big fat bear nearly the same height as him was in his arms. It felt like it was early morning, and the boy and the bear were waking up from a good dream. In the soft yellow lights of the shooting studio, the hair of the bear and the thin hair on Qin Guan\u2019s face were clear.</p><br/><p>Taking the advantage of her position, the assistant immediately decided to keep the photo. That would be one more picture added to her Qin Guan poster collection. It was enough to make her smile for the whole day.</p><br/><p>The photographer put away the camera and saw Qin Guan and the bear lying on the floor side by side. Their heads were close, and the podgy legs of the bear rested softly on Qin Guan's thigh. They looked like two children snuggling up to each other, full of pure, warm childishness. The click of the camera sounded again, and the assistant looked around for her tissue.</p><br/><p>The scene reminded the boss of his own daughter, who had had too much food that day. The boss thought that his daughter had looked as lovely as the large bear. Shall I buy some pig's feet for her on my way home? She will look as lovely as that bear in that kid-sized shirt. Dear boss, you might be overestimating your daughter.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had just finished a cigarette outside. Such an easy photoshoot was nothing for Qin Guan. In her spare time, she had set up an interview for Qin Guan with Ni Dalei of New Silk Road. After Qin Guan had won the competition, Ni Dalei had selected new jobs for him. After all, with a domestic prize, Qin Guan\u2019s level had been promoted to somewhere between C+ and B-.</p><br/><p>Ni had made several interview appointments, including a shooting for a magazine spread, a brand T show, and a still advertisement. Ni expected Qin Guan\u2019s work to increase even further.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue hung up the phone, threw away the butt of the cigarette, and returned to the shooting site. She found Qin Guan lying on the floor and embracing a bear with a silly expression on his face. I\u2019m doomed to be his babysitter. I leave for a minute, and the boy starts acting silly again.</p><br/><p>When the photographer handed her the photo excitedly though, she understood what the expression \"fortune favors fools\" meant. The theme of the photos could have been \"Angel Dreaming\", a sweet but appropriate title. The happy, content smile of the boy matched the cute bear well.</p><br/><p>The photoshoot was completed with great success thanks to Qin Guan's cuteness.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was paid 5,000 yuan, out of which 1,500 yuan went to Sister Xue. Sister Xue packed the bag and returned to her car, only to find Qin Guan in the passenger seat, wearing that kids shirt and holding the bear and the money in his hands.</p><br/><p>He was smiling at her stupidly, which made her angry. She pushed the big bear away in disdain and started the car. \"You are a 19 year-old man, Qin Guan. Why are you still interested in stuffed toys?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan choked up. Actually, he liked cute things, like idols, Garage Kits, Lolitas... Huh? That was strange. Judging by the age difference between him and Cong Nianwei though, she was also a lolita. Qin Guan nodded, ignoring the reality of his Okatu nature. Sister Xue laughed helplessly at his stubbornness to admit his mistake.</p><br/><p>Then she pulled at the bear paws on the shirt sleeves. \"Why don\u2019t you take that silly shirt off?\" Qin Guan moved her hands away and carefully arranged the paws, showing off proudly. \"I\u2019ll see my girlfriend, and I want to show her my new shirt and give her the bear as a present.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was confused. \"I know you like the bear. Why don't you keep it for yourself?\"</p><br/><p>Hesitating, Qin Guan sighed. \"It\u2019s more suitable for a girl. Besides, it was for free.\"</p><br/><p>Does Cong Nianwei know how stingy you are, Qin Guan?</p><br/><p>Sister Xue had to turn the steering wheel around to drive for QH. When they reached their destination, she kicked Qin Guan out of the car and drove away, leaving smoke behind her. I\u2019m so ashamed to be seen with him!</p><br/><p>Paying no attention to the onlookers, Qin Guan put the money in his pocket carelessly and carried the big bear on his shoulders. He called Cong Nianwei while he was walking. \"Is your class over? Fine, I\u2019ll go to your dormitory.\" He ran to her dormitory happily with the bear. Between the small trees, many students saw a big bear running among the leaves, its small tail jumping up and down. Before they could comprehend how a teddy bear could run, Qin Guan had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>At the gate of the building, he retreated before the sharp gaze of the administrator.</p><br/><p>This young man seems to have a mental disorder. I can't let him in. He may harass the girls! The old woman was sure about her judgment, even more so when Qin Guan began to shout loudly.</p><br/><p>\"Cong Nianwei! Cong Nianwei!\" he yelled as he put the bear on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Hearing his shouts, Cong Nianwei and some of her roommates poked their heads out of their balcony. Cong Nianwei burst into laughter when she saw Qin Guan. What\u2019s that silly boy doing? It\u2019s October, yet he\u2019s only wearing a short-sleeved shirt with a waistcoat.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

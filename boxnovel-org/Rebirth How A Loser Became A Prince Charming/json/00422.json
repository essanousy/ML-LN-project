She seemed well-prepared. \"Take a look, everyone. These are the documents concerning the union\u2019s finances ever since Zhang took over the job.</p><br/><p>They looked at the documents page after page. Zhang\u2019s signature was on every page. Without it, the budget wouldn\u2019t have been valid.</p><br/><p>Every detail was clearly recorded by Liu Tianxia. No rules had been broken. The chief criminal seemed to be no other than Zhang Dekai.</p><br/><p>Well done! Liu gave everyone an honest, innocent smile.</p><br/><p>Zhang Dekai was taken away. Qin Guan had no interest in seeing the end of his story. Personal shame should not be made public. He would only lose some money and get a warning.</p><br/><p>Actually, Qin Guan was interested in Liu\u2019s skills. He stopped her before she could leave.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing, Master Qin? You want to defend your opponent against this injustice? Impossible! Look at your trouble-making face!\"</p><br/><p>Without Zhang, the girl had changed completely.</p><br/><p>\"I just want to hire you part-time at my company.\"</p><br/><p>Liu was stunned. She looked at Qin Guan as if he was an idiot.</p><br/><p>\"How could you trust me?\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s only some basic data. Besides, I do trust you.\"</p><br/><p>Liu burst into contemptuous laughter. \"After seeing Zhang Dekai\u2019s end?\"</p><br/><p>\"I read through the forms. You didn\u2019t make any mistakes in the data or process. All the money was taken by Zhang. You didn\u2019t even stuff one coin in your pocket. Why would I not trust you? You are an accountant with professional integrity. I can't let such a talent go to waste!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s eyes were clear. Liu stopped laughing. Burying her face in her hands, she fell silent.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt sorry for her when they saw her shoulders shaking. If Qin Guan was right, then the excellent girl had been hiding from the public eye for a long time.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Liu put her hands down. There was not a single tear on her face.</p><br/><p>\"You read all the forms in a few minutes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Xu Xiaoxiao began to show off to her, as if it was his own achievement.</p><br/><p>\"Have you seen our department\u2019s ranking list? Qin Guan is the best postgraduate student.\"</p><br/><p> Looking at him calmly, Liu Tianxia said in a disdainful manner, \"I\u2019m a junior...\"</p><br/><p>The girl was indeed a genius.</p><br/><p>\"Anyway, I need to have some fun after quitting from the union. You can send the forms to my email. I\u2019ll charge according to the current prices.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Tianxia left the hall without looking back.</p><br/><p>That day was a celebration for Qin Guan. After six months in the US, he had become the president of the Chinese Union of Columbia. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>The storm had gradually passed, and a sincere smile had appeared on the faces of the Chinese students.</p><br/><p>There were more and more parties and balls, hosted by renowned people from different industries and graduates of Columbia University.</p><br/><p>Words couldn\u2019t express their gratitude towards the most handsome president their union had ever had. By then, the advertisement of the Armani perfume had been released all over the world. The beautiful small bottles appeared again and again on mainstream channels and TV stations.</p><br/><p>The perfume quietly made a gap in the line of defence of Channel in North America.</p><br/><p>When they saw Qin Guan hug Raquel, housewives paused, their fingers hovering over the remote.</p><br/><p>When he disappeared like a bubble, they burst into tears.</p><br/><p>\"That b*tch killed him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Vampires are a symbol of evil. Forgive me, my Lord! I am still your sincere servant...\"</p><br/><p>\"I love that handsome boy...\"</p><br/><p>In the latest edition of NYLON, Qin Guan's advertisement took up a whole page. He had left the perfect image up to fashion insiders.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemei and Richard were preparing for the activity. According to the report on their boss\u2019 desk, NYLON had the largest sales volume out of all fashion magazines.</p><br/><p>Qu's prophecy had come true. Richard had lost all confidence in Chad.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Busy days always went by quickly. Before Qin Guan could realize it, Oscars season had come around.</p><br/><p>Before the 2003 award ceremony, movie critics, actors and directors had arrived in Los Angeles to experience the warmth of the West Coast.</p><br/><p>It was a fine day. Qin Guan had asked for leave from Prof. Martin and got together with the cast and crew of \"Heroes\".</p><br/><p>He had no idea about the ceremony until he checked in at the hotel. Horrified, he realized that only three people were qualified to attend the ceremony, Zhang Yimou, Zhang Weiping and him. All the other stars were absent because of their tight schedules.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt strange about the situation, but Sister Xue found out the truth after conducting an investigation in Los Angeles.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Sister Xue, look at me! I'm changing clothes. You haven't seen my body for a long time. I bet that if you compare me to Yin, you'll lose any interest in him.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan never changed. Sister Xue went out of the room with a knowing smile.</p><br/><p>No one was faster than a model changing his clothes, unless one was wearing nothing at all. A few minutes later, Qin Guan was wearing a pair of soft, comfortable velvet pyjamas.</p><br/><p>He Gong followed Qin Guan with the camera. They had to walk a long way before they reached the hotel swimming pool. When the walky-talky rang, they exchanged a look.</p><br/><p>The old hotel still had spiral stairs with smooth iron handrails. If one looked down from the top, they got dizzy. Qin Guan went out of his room and wandered in the empty hallway. He had been suffering from insomnia for years.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he leapt from the stairs and fell down like an angel with broken wings. Before anyone could scream out, he slid down along the handrail like a kid playing on a slide. He moved down the end of the rail wildly as He Gong filmed him. Indie film directors loved scenes like that. It looked like a dream on his camera.</p><br/><p>No one but Qin Guan knew how much it hurt to do this. The friction between his bottom and the rail was very painful. If he slid down one more floor, he would be the first actor to have their butt catch fire during shooting.</p><br/><p>The director stood by the end of the stairs silently. He didn't give Qin Guan any instructions, so he just worked his way to the swimming pool across the dark hall jerkily. Director Chen looked at the lonely figure from behind the camera.</p><br/><p>His acting skills are perfect. He treats even the simplest scene seriously. Everyone can feel his sadness and confusion.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan cried to himself. My butt hurts!</p><br/><p>It was a wonderful misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan reached the end of the way, where the crew was gathered, amid loud shouts of applause. The water in the large pool glittered under the pale moonlight.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xue was standing on the other side of the pool in a pink swimming suit. They looked at each other from afar.</p><br/><p>Both the hero and the heroine had stayed up late to swim. Their meeting was a romantic coincidence. Qin Guan ravished her with a kiss.</p><br/><p>Yes, that's right. Qin Guan grabbed this opportunity to kiss her. Generally speaking, such things only happened in stories about aggressive male CEOs, but now it was also happening in a musical.</p><br/><p>Everyone gathered around the pool curiously to watch the mysterious award-winning actor kiss the girl. All kinds of idlers showed up, pretending to be working on something.</p><br/><p>Zeng Zhiwei and Zhang Xueyou hid in a corner, holding cups of coffee in their hands. Wu Junru stood next to the director, her eyes fixed on the camera. Everyone was captivated by the beautiful couple.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan jumped into the pool without hesitation, only to realize that the water barely reached his knees.</p><br/><p>The prop team looked on blankly. The prop master, who was a veteran, opened the gate before the director could go crazy. We can pour water into the pool while we are shooting.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not affected by any means. He just hid his face under the water like an ostrich in the face of danger. He had to perform under the water anyway.</p><br/><p>Shocked by his quick reaction, the crew adjusted the angle of the camera. Qin Guan had saved the scene and avoided a retake.</p><br/><p>Everyone had thought it was impossible. Usually, they would wait for the director to adjust the setting to perfection before they continued. That was a common routine for actors in both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was used to Western methods though. His experience with indie films had taught him to be more flexible and innovative.</p><br/><p>No one wanted to waste any time or money, so Qin Guan's improvisation had taught them a good lesson.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

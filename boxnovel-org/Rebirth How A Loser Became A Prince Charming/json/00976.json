He passed the safety check and got on his flight to London.</p><br/><p> The first-class cabin was a sight to behold. When the viewers were presented with the comfortable environment, Qin Guan's job was over.</p><br/><p> It was a sunny day, so sunshine went through the portholes. The broad seats, the bright cabin, the considerate flight attendants\u2026 Every detail reflected the outstanding services of Air China. Of course, one had to have enough money to enjoy them.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan did what he usually did during a flight. Soon, he turned off his light and fell asleep on the adjustable chair. The film crew left the cabin silently and went to their own seats.</p><br/><p> At last, the director's assistant had the opportunity to ask him some questions.</p><br/><p> \"Are you angry about this assignment, sir? You know that everyone starts their career by shooting music videos and advertisements. Air China is actually a good chance for a rookie like you. Besides, Qin Guan is the protagonist! So many directors will envy you. Hey! What are you thinking about? I'm talking to you!\"</p><br/><p>Is there something wrong with the guy? He hasn't said anything ever since he met Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> Director Wen came back to his senses when the assistant patted his back. He rubbed his stiff face and turned around slowly to face the assistant.</p><br/><p> \"What did I just do, Liu?\"</p><br/><p> \"Are you kidding? You just filmed an ad for Air China.\"</p><br/><p> \"Oh. Was Qin Guan the protagonist?\"</p><br/><p> \"Of course. You're scaring me, Wen. Are you okay? Did you lose your memory?\"</p><br/><p> The director came out of his reverie. He hadn't been able to fall asleep at night ever since he had heard the news. When he had actually met Qin Guan personally, he had been stupefied. His mind had gone completely blank.</p><br/><p> Although he had gotten to work automatically, he only came back to reality when Qin Guan disappeared.</p><br/><p> When his assistant found out the reason behind his behavior, he was left speechless. The first thing he did was play back the film. He was afraid that Wen would ruin it in this state.</p><br/><p> Soon, he let out a sigh of relief. The ad could be considered Wen's best work. It was an inspired film without any commercial characteristics.</p><br/><p> \"Could you do me a favor, Liu?\"</p><br/><p> \"What kind of favor?\"</p><br/><p> \"Could you ask Qin Guan for an autograph on my behalf?\"</p><br/><p> \"Why? You could ask him yourself.\"</p><br/><p> \"I'm too nervous to do it...\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled and granted his request. The flight attendants caught on, too.</p><br/><p> \"I really like your films, Qin Guan. I hope you will release even better ones next year.\"</p><br/><p> \"Thanks. Maybe you won't need to wait till next year. Two American films of mine will premiere in China during the Spring Festival. One of them is a sci-fi thriller and the other one is a comedy. There is one for everyone.\"</p><br/><p> Actually, both films were really funny, but the one that had been shot in the museum was especially so. Children would like such a funny, educational film, so the Chinese critics accepted the two Hollywood blockbusters easily.</p><br/><p> The long queue for an autograph came to an end when the flight attendant approached Qin Guan with three pieces of paper. She wanted to ask for an autograph for the pilot and co-pilot as well.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan left the airport without seeing his silent fans again. As soon as he landed, his job came to a temporary end.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

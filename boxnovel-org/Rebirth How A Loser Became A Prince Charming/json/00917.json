This was actually pretty much Qin Guan's total fortune in 2005. As Qin Guan sighed with emotion, Braga mustered the courage to walk over to him.</p><br/><p>The Brazilian beauty, who had black hair and eyes, was much younger than Qin Guan, but she was more experienced than him. Everyone liked beautiful women, so even if they were green hands, pretty girls were still popular in superhero films.</p><br/><p>Braga had been participating in all kinds of Hollywood films ever since she was 18 years old. After being confused for six years, she had finally gotten the courage to ask Qin Guan, the most famous man she had ever cooperated with, a question.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me, Qin Guan? May I ask you a question? I hope I'm not bothering you.\"</p><br/><p>She was a sensitive woman, but she considered Qin Guan a kind man, so she had decided to express her thoughts, even though he was a stranger.</p><br/><p>Plus, she thought Qin Guan was qualified to answer her question.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to her. Their short cooperation had been enough for her to show her professionalism. She was not like those bland Hollywood beauties. She had impressed him a lot. Plus, she was one of those rare people who were immune to his looks.</p><br/><p>\"Of course you are not. I'll be happy to answer your question.\"</p><br/><p>\"I've been wondering why my agent is always choosing sci-fi, post-apocalyptic movies for me. Ever since I entered the circle, I have never acted in a single normal film. Do you think I'm scary?\"</p><br/><p>That's a good question.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at her carefully. She was a typical Brazilian beauty. The only characteristics that might interest a director had to be her black hair and eyes, as well as the slightly droopy corners of her mouth.</p><br/><p>As an Asian, Qin Guan didn't know what the basic aesthetic standards of Western people were. One had to be born one to know. Western people couldn't even distinguish between Fan Pingping and Li Bingbing though.</p><br/><p>As a result, he had to find another way to answer her question politely.</p><br/><p>\"I think you are both pretty and smart. That must be why they cast you in thrillers. Beautiful ladies with walnuts for brains are usually satisfied with playing the pretty girl. That way, they don't need to pour their soul into each character.\"</p><br/><p>\"Heroines in thrillers and sci-fi films are different though. They face much more complicated situations, so they have to be strong enough, both physically and mentally, to deal with all kinds of emergencies. These roles require better acting skills. That's why you are perfect for them.\"</p><br/><p>\"There are lots of beautiful women in Hollywood, but only a few of them can impress the audience. Do you want to be famous for your private life instead?\"</p><br/><p>Braga shook her head.</p><br/><p>\"Exactly. That would be an insult for any real actor. How many big films have you been in? Is it three or four? That's enough. If every director thinks of you as soon as they get such a script, or the fans consider you a goddess, then you are successful.\"</p><br/><p>\"When your name is mentioned in the same sentence as Julia Roberts or Sharon Stone, you won't be worried about the type of films you act in anymore. You will be able to just be yourself.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The vaccine that saved human lives was a poison that would change the monsters into different creatures. Nobody had the right to change them into another species.</p><br/><p>Did Lawrence want to convey an underlying message concerning the secret surveillance of common American people? In a nation that advocated freedom, ordinary people wanted to finally experience real democracy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to his senses. The director's reasonable explanation made him accept the change without hesitation. It would only take an extra five minutes after all. Wang Liying told something to the producer in a low voice and then gestured at Qin Guan that everything was okay. He would get paid extra for this.</p><br/><p>At the cameraman's signal, a large hole was blasted into the ceiling above Qin Guan with a bang. The leader of the monsters rushed up to him. Qin Guan hid behind the barricade and threw the case with the vaccine at Alice, the female supporting character.</p><br/><p>When Alice caught the case, she realized that they were separated by a thick glass wall. Qin Guan was relieved. The roaring monsters were approaching, but he was at ease. He could see the beautiful future waving at him. He had saved the hope of humanity. Nothing could prevent him from leaving that boring world now.</p><br/><p>He had achieved his goal before the end of his life.</p><br/><p>He growled and pressed the button without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Bang! The whole lab was destroyed.</p><br/><p>\"Perfect! Wonderful! Where is the prop team? Restore the ceiling to the state it was in before Qin Guan pressed the button. We'll shoot another version of the ending.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took advantage of the situation to ask a final question.</p><br/><p>\"Which ending will make it to the screen?\"</p><br/><p>\"That will depend on the company.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"We'll choose the one that's more relevant.\"</p><br/><p>So you haven't decided yet?</p><br/><p>The right decision was obvious. The first ending would make it to the theatrical version, and the second one would be included in the DVD.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to do his best during the second version, as it could bring some much-needed life to the declining DVD sales.</p><br/><p>As soon as the prop team had finished its job, Qin Guan returned to the set and witnessed the emotional exchange between the leader of the monsters and a female monster which he had injected with the vaccine. Suddenly, the dozens of photos of monsters on the wall seemed like a joke. They had all been killed by Qin Guan for the sake of the experiment. They were not his guinea pigs though. They were living beings whose lives were worth just as much as his.</p><br/><p>We are not sick. We don't want to become like you.</p><br/><p>The monster looked down at Qin Guan. He considered killing him after saving his woman, but instead he left immediately with his followers. Qin Guan was left sitting on the ground in confusion. His horror and loneliness were now meaningless. He decided to leave the city and head to the human shelter.</p><br/><p>The cameras worked endlessly. Everyone was left speechless by the ending. Then the crew burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't open the glass wall to get out. Alice, who was played by a Brazilian beauty, helped him push it hard. Their effort was in vain though.</p><br/><p>The crew lifted the thick glass, laughing all the while.</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck... I thought I had to crawl out of the hole...\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha ha...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her tutor at the Manchester Institute of Technology had loved her so much that he had taught her all his secrets.</p><br/><p>One day, she had received a call at the laboratory, taken her mask off and left without looking back. She had packed her luggage immediately and gone to work for the J Clothing laboratory.</p><br/><p>The strange girl was sitting before two silent men and studying a pile of samples. Suddenly, she turned off the lamp and took off her glasses. She looked as enchanting as an evil spirit.</p><br/><p>Unlike Huang Jiajia's raised phoenix eyes, her dignified thick eyebrows and big eyes were a perfect match for her elegant, flirtatious aura. She always walked and stood slowly, with a subtle charm in her movements.</p><br/><p>She was a paradox of danger and innocuity.</p><br/><p>The girl started picking strips of cloth from the samples and putting them together. Her nails were painted enamel.</p><br/><p>The process took her a full three minutes. Both Xue Yayan, the boss of J Clothing, and Guo were waiting for her, but she did not seem sorry.</p><br/><p>When she had arranged all the strips in order, she finally stood up. \"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>Guo felt glad, but his mouth opened wide at Hu's next action.</p><br/><p>Hu took a pair of sharp scissors and cut off the hanging parts of the strips carefully.</p><br/><p>\"Perfect!\" she said before turning her eyes to the two men.</p><br/><p>\"When did you get here?\"</p><br/><p>We've been sitting here for an hour! We were just too afraid to disturb you!</p><br/><p>In Hu's eyes, the two men paled in comparison to the cloth strips. She spread her fingers proudly, showing off the natural enamel, which was a mixture of Arabic gum, impatiens, alum, gelatin and beeswax. It was actually based on an ancient formula of the Ming Dynasty.</p><br/><p>\"I know what you're waiting for. Don't be nervous. Do you see these?\"</p><br/><p>Guo nodded, standing up for his boss. He had to look ashamed for the sake of his superior.</p><br/><p>\"Our team could have developed it too. High-tech fabric is nothing. Some cheaper materials can be good alternatives for it. Maybe they will get more popular in the market, but our new products can do even better than this.\"</p><br/><p>Come back to reality, sister. The production lines can't be stopped. We will lose money!</p><br/><p>Xue Yayan held back his tears. Why are scientists always living in a dream? I just want to make profit!</p><br/><p>\"Fine, fine! Don't take that expression with me!\" Hu Li pointed at Guo's forehead.</p><br/><p>\"If you want quick money, you need to work on this first.\"</p><br/><p>\"Memory fabric is a joke. My tutor's team developed it. It's the same formula our laboratory developed. I don't see why people are fighting over it. The formula is right here.\"</p><br/><p>She pointed to her own forehead. When she saw the wide smiles on their faces, she changed her attitude again. \"Good work, right? Where is it?\" She stretched her palm towards Xue.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, oh! I got it. Xiao Guo, give this to Dr. Hu.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem.\" Guo carefully handed her a lunch box.</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\" The girl smiled. \"Pea flour cake! Fresh from the oven! It's delicious!\"</p><br/><p>Before her voice could fade away, her cheeks bulged like a hamster's with food and she gave Guo a thumbs-up. \"When Boss Xue mentioned braised Dongpo pork hock with brown sauce on the phone, I'd had pizza for three days in a row at the laboratory. That's why I returned to China. I'd rather enjoy the food at home than starve in the UK. Believe me, British food is not made for humans!\"</p><br/><p>The girl concentrated on her food amid the harmonious atmosphere. A few minutes later, Xue's phone rang.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Qin Guan? What's the matter? If this is about the money, we can negotiate. What? What fabric? We do not have a high-end fabric.\"</p><br/><p>\"You know everything? Hu Li? What do you suggest?\" </p><br/><p>\"You want to buy some? Of course you can. Which kind do you want? We have only common fabrics.\"</p><br/><p>\"Memory fabric? No problem. We are focusing on the low end of the market right now. Okay! I'll call you when I have the batch.\"</p><br/><p>The other two were listening to their call carefully. They did not feel ashamed. They were actually really excited.</p><br/><p>\"Was that Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Does he want to buy the fabric? Have we been exposed?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, here is the order.\"</p><br/><p>A complacent smile emerged on his face. I made the right decision!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

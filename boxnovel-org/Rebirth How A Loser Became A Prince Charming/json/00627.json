He was determined to do his best to finish his guest role early. He only had five minutes of screentime in the film after all.</p><br/><p>Fan Wei was the leading character in the scene, who would be making funny jokes. Qin Guan would just help him amuse the audience.</p><br/><p>He would be portraying one of the three robbers. It was only a scene shot with a single lens, but most of the actors were gathered there to shoot some highlights as a way to test the shooting and editing skills of the director.</p><br/><p>This was nothing for Feng. When all the main actors were present, the funny scene began.</p><br/><p>They were on a train heading from the plateau to the urban area. The staff of the Qinghai Railway Administration had helped them arrange the set in a few spare carriages on the tracks. All the figurants were natives. The leading actors were all in position, waiting for the director's orders.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was standing in front of the carriage with Fan Wei. You Yong was right behind them.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Qin!\" Fan's unique accent amused Qin Guan, but he tried his best to suppress his laughter.</p><br/><p>\"That's it! I was afraid that you would laugh during my performance. Greenhands always laugh at me!\"</p><br/><p>It seemed like he was always made fun of.</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, Fan. I promise I won't say a word...\"</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his words, the assistant told them to get started.</p><br/><p>Old Ge You was standing across from Qin Guan. He had a big round head, but he was just as tall as Qin Guan. He was looking emotionally at Qin Guan, who was wearing a cat mask. The two of them exchanged a meaningful glance.</p><br/><p>Out of the blue, You Yong's gun was pushed against Ge's head.</p><br/><p>\"Robbery!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked down at Ge and whispered a secret to him while waving his forefinger.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the carriage panicked. \"Hush! Silence!\" Qin Guan warned them gently.</p><br/><p>Fan couldn't stand it anymore. \"Ru.. Run!\" he shouted at the crowd.</p><br/><p>Ge You sighed as Fan forced the words out of his mouth. Then the old man said calmly, \"Robbers like you annoy me. You don't even have any basic skills...\" He was telling the truth.</p><br/><p>His calm interpretation was extremely funny. Comedians who didn't use exaggerated facial expressions and body language were much more talented than guys like Jim Carrey.</p><br/><p>They were more capable and could have more successful careers, as it was easier for them to form their own style.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan observed everyone's acting skills carefully. They were all experienced actors in the Chinese film industry, so there was a lot for him to learn from them.</p><br/><p>The shooting went on. Both Fan Wei and Qin Guan took off their masks to reveal their faces. Qin Guan melded carefully with the background, serving like a perfect contrast to Fan's funny performance.</p><br/><p>Director Feng nodded behind the camera. What a good actor! He knows how to cooperate with others. He is not like those rising stars who are always eager to show off.</p><br/><p>The honest actor was about to be tested though.</p><br/><p>The main camera retreated, leaving Qin Guan to be the center of the scene. His orchid-like fingers made him look like a sissy as he waved his arms before his chest, threatening all the passengers. \"Be serious! We are robbing you!\"</p><br/><p>As expected, everyone burst into laughter. The weapons in the robbers' hands didn't frighten them at all.</p><br/><p>\"Stop laughing! We are robbing you!\" He had an authentic capital accent that lacked any scary elements.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\"</p><br/><p>Feng was the first to burst into laughter. The whole crew was looking at him blankly. \"Great! Cut!\" he shouted in an effort to hide his guilt.</p><br/><p>But we were just half-way through the scene...</p><br/><p>\"Five-minute break so everyone can laugh!\"</p><br/><p>What a considerate man!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

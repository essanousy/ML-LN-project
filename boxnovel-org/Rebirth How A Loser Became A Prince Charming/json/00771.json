Qin Guan will audition when he comes back from America. We are professional filmmakers after all. He is a good, honest boy. He does everything the directors tell him. It's true. Can I send him the script first?\"</p><br/><p>Yin nodded in satisfaction before shouting at his employee, \"Qiang Zi, get me a script!\" The employee nodded and left.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Yin concentrated on the script. Much later, Yin Li let out a long sigh of relief at a corner outside the studio. Did I give a good performance?</p><br/><p>He had pretended to be a proud director before the famous actor's agent. He had actually never worked with actors like Qin Guan before. The American philosophy might have made the young man rebellious, so Yin Li had decided to act proud at the beginning.</p><br/><p>Actually, most directors didn't know the young award-winning actor well, with the exception of some sixth-generation directors, but the foreign directors he had worked with were all renowned idols of the Chinese directors.</p><br/><p>Everyone was curious about Qin Guan, as he had received unanimous praise from famous directors. Yin Li was very eager to meet him. Meanwhile, Qin Guan welcomed some uninvited guests to his new house in Los Angeles.</p><br/><p>Some good friends had encouraged him to buy a villa in Beverly Hills. The place looked like a mansion in the eyes of the local residents, but it was actually the same size as Qin Guan's villa in Long Island. The only difference was the private building in front of the entrance and the small hill behind the villa.</p><br/><p>Americans loved their privacy, and Beverly Hills was a place where Hollywood stars could hide from reporters. Most of the villas there were empty though, as only a few owners were actually stationed in Los Angeles.</p><br/><p>Some of them were not even American. They only stayed in Beverly Hills when they visited America to attend some important event. For them, Beverly Hills was only a vacation spot.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had acted wisely in buying the villa. The house had been on sale at a low price, because its owner had gone bankrupt and had to sell it to pay off his debt.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had found Los Angeles to be much better than New York. Most of his work in America took place in that city, so he had bought the villa at a favorable price. 4.8 million dollars was considered a good price in 2005.</p><br/><p>When he woke up from a good night's sleep in his mansion, two men were standing outside his door. It was Director Chen Kexin and his assistant. The director stood before the award-winning actor, who was still in his blue pajamas, with a familiar smile.</p><br/><p>Chen didn't feel embarrassed for visiting him.</p><br/><p>'Why didn't you stay at a hotel? Why buy a house in Beverly Hills? If you are rich enough, you could invest in my film. No Chinese star would buy a villa in this area.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you too excited to speak? Show us around then!\"</p><br/><p>No, elder brother. I was just left speechless by your visit. Qin Guan couldn't help but invite them in.</p><br/><p>\"I had no idea you would be visiting, so I have nothing to treat you. What would you like to drink?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was not very familiar with the rooms of the house. He had to try three doors before he found the kitchen.</p><br/><p>The previous owner must have liked parties, as the villa had a large hall and plenty of guest rooms. It could actually have served as a family inn.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, Qin Guan had been inspired by the eight tubs inside the villa and considered turning it into a hotel. After calculating the cost though, he had rejected the idea.</p><br/><p>Chen and his assistant asked for a glass of water each. Fortunately, the director shared the purpose of his visit right away.</p><br/><p>\"I can't go to New York before the Oscars!\" Qin Guan shook his head. \"No, I have a tight schedule. Plus, I was not nominated by the Queens Festival.\"</p><br/><p>He had a point. Chen smiled awkwardly and gave up on his plan, putting forward a second suggestion.</p><br/><p>\"Could you make time to meet the three producers of the film? Just one hour. Could you maybe take a picture with them?\" he asked sincerely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

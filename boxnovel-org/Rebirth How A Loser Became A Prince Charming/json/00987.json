Soldiers were simple people, so military camp was the perfect place for people with real practical learning.</p><br/><p> However, there were many actors around who had suffered a lot and wouldn't accept a comrade who hadn't been tortured like them.</p><br/><p> This was impossible!</p><br/><p> They were all eager to try another plan.</p><br/><p> \"Will he shoot any other scenes today?\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes. He has to run around the playground and perform a muster drill at night.\"</p><br/><p> \"He better be in the dark.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes!\"</p><br/><p> Wang Baoqiang, who was an honest boy, asked, \"Is that proper? If anything goes wrong, Brother Qin will have to work overnight.\"</p><br/><p> \"You don't need to worry about him. He is a smart guy.\"</p><br/><p> \"But...\"</p><br/><p> \"Hush! Let's go!\"</p><br/><p> They had fooled Wang once again.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was about to experience his first night at the camp.</p><br/><p> When the lights went out, all the men in the dormitory took off their uniforms and put on tanks and shorts.</p><br/><p> \"Let's go to sleep.\"</p><br/><p> Everyone went to bed, leaving only the camera to function in the moonlight. When Qin Guan covered his body with the quilt, the cameraman looked away.</p><br/><p> Wow! Wonderful! This is the first time I get lost in a frame.</p><br/><p> Director Kang nodded in satisfaction. Suddenly, he felt Duan Yihong pull at his sleeve. The cameraman turned off the camera silently.</p><br/><p> \"Beep--\"</p><br/><p> The assembly call started screaming in the quiet building. Chen Sicheng and Wang Baoqiang bounced off the upper bank nervously and started beating on the bed frame to wake the two guys sleeping below. \"Muster drill!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was confused. There was no such scene in the script. According to the original script, they would just have to go downstairs for the assembly. They didn't need to leave their dormitory like real soldiers.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan, who had been given no advance warning, didn't move. He just lay still in bed and waited for the director's orders.</p><br/><p> The other three guys, who couldn't keep acting, realized that Qin Guan was watching them leisurely. This was stupid.</p><br/><p> \"I'm out. We are all idiots. He is just laughing at us!\"</p><br/><p> Director Kang realized what was going on.</p><br/><p>So you want Qin Guan to share your woes? He is no fool!</p><br/><p> Qin Guan felicitated his decision.</p><br/><p> \"You all performed really well. I thought this was an extra scene involving you three. Is it a kind of welcoming ceremony?\"</p><br/><p> Wang walked over to Qin Guan, looking ashamed. \"This is my fault, Brother Qin. I conspired against you with them.\"</p><br/><p> \"Ha! You don't need to be so serious. You didn't plan this. Who was it? Was it Duan Yihong?\"</p><br/><p> Duan, who had run down to the playground, shouted at them calmly, \"I'm ready for the next scene, director! Shall we begin now?\"</p><br/><p> Life was like a TV show, and TV shows mimicked life.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was the winner.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hundreds of candles were placed around it, shining with a soft light. The candlelight was reflected on the glass ceiling, looking extraordinarily romantic.</p><br/><p> This had to be the site. Qin Guan went through the room hurriedly and walked to the small cabinet in the back.</p><br/><p> The bustling scene inside brought him back to reality.</p><br/><p> The assistant took out his outfits and pushed him towards the makeup room. Without saying anything, Qin Guan changed clothes in a corner. I\u2019m coming, New York!</p><br/><p> Distinguished guests had been invited to the show, including not only VIPs of the fashion circle, but also curious residents of the Upper East Side.</p><br/><p> The educated guests did not look very excited. They were just whispering greetings to acquaintances.</p><br/><p> There was no opening speech or gorgeous background. A deep rhythmic song began to play.</p><br/><p> The red velvet curtain was suddenly opened, and a splendid Christmas tree was revealed. The reflected light lit up the whole hall.</p><br/><p> Shoes stomped on the floor as beautiful models started filing out through the curtain. The black and grey tones were a little dark for the season, but the brave, practical designs attracted the audience\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p> The Upper East Side residents, who focused on high-end tailoring, were their target group.</p><br/><p> An anxious middle-aged man in a polo shirt looked shocked by the models. He had been annoyed for a long time. As a director of an independent film with a limited budget, his trip to the Cannes Film Festival had been unsuccessful.</p><br/><p> The first reason was that he had been short on money. The second was that the vulgar actors had not been interested in his film. When it came right down to it though, the first reason had been the most important.</p><br/><p> Everyone knew that if you were lucky enough to win a big prize, your place in US movie theatres would be mediocre at best.</p><br/><p> This was because people stressed on box office success, which was the only way to attract public attention. That was why Director Gus was gloomy.</p><br/><p> The show had inspired him though. His actors could come from the fashion circle! They were all beauties after all. Thinking of that, he began to observe the models carefully in excitement.</p><br/><p> When Qin Guan got on the stage, it was like a small stone had been dropped on a quiet lake, causing ripples to form on its surface.</p><br/><p> The Asian model looked different from the other models. He was too elegant to be real. He looked like an illusion that would be gone with the wind.</p><br/><p> As Qin Guan walked through the room, the audience held its breath for fear of scaring the fairy away.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, drums started to beat. In a moment, he became a general, a king and an emperor. Every identity presented resonated with the model.</p><br/><p> He was wearing black silk pants, that looked thin and airy. It was the first time CK had used oriental silk as a material.</p><br/><p> His loose pant legs were stuffed into his high boots. Actually, that style was out of date for Chinese people.</p><br/><p> It was not a real design in China. Labor workers and independent traders used to stuff their pant legs into their shoes to move more comfortably before 1949.</p><br/><p> The difference was that they used to wear straw sandals and Qin Guan was wearing leather boots.</p><br/><p> Americans had no idea about it though. They just liked the cultural shock. Going with the wind was their favorite feeling.</p><br/><p> Besides, black was the best color for elites. Compared to other colorful outfits, that one suited the Asian model the best.</p><br/><p> No one knew who had made the final decision, photographer Jones, the senior executives of the operational department or the chief designer, but the outfit looked like it had been designed specifically for Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> The candlelight was reflected back from the glazed eggs, leaving a colorful halo on Qin Guan's face. It was a classic clash between black and white. A blooming flower! A scream amid the quiet!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

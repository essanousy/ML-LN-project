I hope that you will give us priority. People are inclined to work with acquaintances in the fashion circle after all. Besides, there is always affection among us humans. If you maintain your professionalism and our brand remains a suitable platform for you, I would like to continue our cooperation.\"</p><br/><p>Armani spoke neither too fast nor too slow. His sincere words moved Qin Guan.</p><br/><p> \"You are definitely my priority. Chinese people always show their gratitude, and your help and encouragement has given me a new life...\"</p><br/><p>The two of them shook hands. Armani was a kind old man who liked to help young people, and Qin Guan was a promising, grateful young man.</p><br/><p> The warm scene didn't last long though. The music was still echoing around the square.</p><br/><p>\"Let's enjoy the show, shall we?\"</p><br/><p>Several girls went out one after the other. The first eight girls were fair-skinned Europeans wearing colorful furs. The furs included fox, mink and other animals.</p><br/><p>After that group came some black beauties. They were as black as Qin Guan's neighbor Coulibaly, and all of them were renowned beauties in Africa.</p><br/><p>They were wearing zebra, leopard and tiger skins.</p><br/><p>When the last group of models came out, Qin Guan saw some familiar faces.</p><br/><p>Du Juan and Lv Yan had been assigned to the Gucci show by the organizing committee. All six Asian models were wearing deerskin and chamois skin. Qin Guan held his breath.</p><br/><p>According to Sister Xue, Gucci had been one of the first brands to send him a contract for the next year. Qin Guan looked at their collection and threw the contract away.</p><br/><p>He wanted to cooperate with old Giorgio Armani for another year. I better keep some distance from that brand.</p><br/><p>The collection met the demands of high-end customers though. Orders started flooding the box, making the assistant smile with joy.</p><br/><p>Gucci had captivated the hearts of rich people obsessed with the beauty of nature.</p><br/><p>Hunters in Kansas liked to hang stag heads and antlers on the doors of their houses. Those noble ladies had a similar sense of taste.</p><br/><p>Clothing was a way of showing off, and the best choice was to select original materials.</p><br/><p>After the conference, Qin Guan and Armani left together talking happily. They paid no attention to the Gucci director, who was shooting proud looks at them.</p><br/><p>Most of the audience was leaving the site while talking about the collection. The gate opened. Outside was a small square with a round fountain. The parking lot was right across the street.</p><br/><p> People paused there and said goodbye to each other. Suddenly, a sharp sound interrupted them.</p><br/><p>The reporters and the photographers turned around to find the origin of the sound. The security guards also became alert.</p><br/><p>It was a shabby truck with a large container at the back that stood out against the luxurious cars and well-dressed guests.</p><br/><p>The truck pulled up to the square and a red-haired girl in a bikini opened the door and got out. The girl, who had a cigarette in her mouth, was wearing high-heels.</p><br/><p> She lit the cigarette and took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>A shaky smoke ring flew out of her mouth. Everyone on the square felt attracted to the strange girl.</p><br/><p>\"Cool! Let's get to work!\"</p><br/><p>The girl seemed to come back to life as she walked over to the container. She used one of her feet to stomp on the fence and the other to open the door of the container.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>The door opened and light poured into the dark container.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

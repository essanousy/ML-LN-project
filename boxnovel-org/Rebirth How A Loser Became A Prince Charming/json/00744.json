Thanks to Qin Guan's effort, Chinese designs took their rightful place among the competing countries. The open-minded Paris fashion circle showed great interest in the oriental patterns. </p><br/><p> However, they didn't pay much attention to Lynn Hung and Eileen's looks. Instead, they were inspired by Liu Wen's thick eyebrows and phoenix-like eyes.</p><br/><p>Another strange phenomenon also took place. Although Qin Guan hadn't brought many male models to Paris, they still managed to attract the attention of the most famous brands.</p><br/><p>Male models were rare all over the world, and those handsome guys were at their prime, so Sister Xue started receiving non-stop offers from designers and brands. Qin Guan's agent felt like she was at the top of the world.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had received countless invitations, so he had to be very selective. He only attended two shows, the Armani and the Hermes one, and he set brand new standards for the industry by being the first model to be paid based on how many times he walked down the runway.</p><br/><p>T stages varied in length, but Hermes paid more than 10,000 dollars for him to walk on the stage once. Hermes' smart director didn't choose the floating bridge beside the Louvre, which was 100-meters long. Instead, he chose the stage by the pond of the Jardin des Tuileries, which was only 10-meters long.</p><br/><p>The salary was reasonable considering that Qin Guan was the only Asian top model at the event. The Hermes' director hired the popular model to show off to Gucci, LV and Channel.</p><br/><p>As night fell in Paris, the garden of the royal European family opened its gates to the guests.</p><br/><p>All the guests had to wear old European costumes. Old-fashioned gentlemen were wearing white gloves and holding sticks, while their female companions were wearing long dresses. The site of the show was a small white dome that looked like a small-scale opera of the 1900s.</p><br/><p>The U stage, which resembled the stage in \"Phantom of the Opera\", was paved with black and red velvet. Long tassels were hanging down from the curtains, swaying in the night breeze.</p><br/><p>The first row of seats, which was labelled with different names, was already occupied. The people behind just stood there with cameras in their hands, their eyes fixed on the stage.</p><br/><p>The big lights around them went out at the same time and small kerosene lamps lit up one after the other on the stage. The dim lights revealed the luxurious royal yard that dated back to an era before the French Revolution.</p><br/><p>As background music began playing, the Hermes show began.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the first model to set foot on the stage, wearing a monocle. A silver chain was swaying beside his ear. He was wearing a white shirt, black pants, a waistcoat and leather shoes. The gem buttons and golden watch chain on his chest had been used by nobles when they wanted to outshine each other.</p><br/><p>The show brought back the old times, when noblemen took baths in their jewellery and heritage was counted by chests full of golden coins. Qin Guan was holding a soft black leather bag with a square bottom in his hand. It looked like a large briefcase one could take on a business trip. The four buttons on its bottom helped it balance when it was set down on a flat surface.</p><br/><p>As his assistant, Wang had to count Qin Guan's steps.</p><br/><p>\"44, 45, 46... Yeah! That's right!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan actually wished he could walk to the end of the world.</p><br/><p>When he led Zhang Liang and Nan Fulong backstage, he asked how they felt with a smile. He was no longer the cool, proud model he had been on the stage.</p><br/><p>\"How are you feeling? This is the best stage in the world, but if you remain calm, it will feel just like Professor Li's shabby stage.\"</p><br/><p>The two young men let out a long sigh of relief at his kind, casual question.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! I was so nervous. Thank god you were with us, Brother Qin, or I would have made so many mistakes!\"</p><br/><p>Nan's Tianjin accent sounded very funny. Before Qin Guan and Zhang Lian could burst into laughter though, the group behind them entered the backstage area. They were also a combination of Asian models.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

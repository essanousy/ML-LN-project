I want to sing a song.\"</p><br/><p>The musician looked up and saw Nick, the member of a popular band. The other members of the band were making noise for their friend, making sure Nick had everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>As a professional singer, Nick was not nervous at all. The bigger the audience, the more excited he was.</p><br/><p>Picking up the microphone, he spoke in the direction of Hilton, \"I would like to dedicate this song to Paris Whitney Hilton, the beautiful princess who has conquered my heart. I hope she can reserve a place for me in her heart.\"</p><br/><p>The blonde boy was radiating tenderness and love through his eyes. The girls under the stage were screaming. This was not surprising, as the band was popular all over the world. All members of the band were very handsome.</p><br/><p>Nick didn't pay attention to the girls though. He was concentrated on Hilton. As the music began, he started to sing.</p><br/><p>It was a lovely love song. All the party guests stopped chatting, getting absorbed in the beautiful music and the handsome boy on the stage.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s so beautiful...\"</p><br/><p>\"I admire Hilton so much. This song makes me feel like I\u2019m drunk...\"</p><br/><p>Hilton was looking at Qin Guan though.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! She really likes Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! The party queen is hiding in a corner!\"</p><br/><p>Two annoying voices were suddenly heard. As expected, they were Hilton's frenemies, Britney and Madonna.</p><br/><p>\"It was shameless of you to come here!\" Actually, Hilton had sent them invitations when they had still been friends. Their friendship had ended unexpectedly easily though.</p><br/><p>\"Stop blaming us. Nick is singing for you on the stage, while you are lost in thought. How is that polite?\"</p><br/><p>Britney saw Nick cast a look at them and realize Hilton was absent-minded. Wow! This will be good...</p><br/><p>She was right. Nick dared not blame his goddess. Instead, he blamed Qin Guan. He finished his song and gestured at the audience. Everyone fell silent, waiting for his next move.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, everyone. Does anybody feel that this party is different than usual?\"</p><br/><p>\"Is there anything special about it?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's interesting as always.\"</p><br/><p>\"Right!\" Nick continued. \"Did you notice that there are photos and posters of a guy hanging around us? Do you know him? Tell me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s Qin Guan! A hot top model!\"</p><br/><p>\"He was the Best Actor Award Winner at Cannes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" Nick had just come to Los Angeles from the UK. He had no idea about the spreading news about Qin Guan. He nearly choked on the stage.</p><br/><p>\"Well, it seems that the man is a celebrity in America. Would you like to see him on the stage then?\" the smart guy changed the topic in a flash.</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is Qin Guan here?\"</p><br/><p> Some audience members began to scream. He was the most talked-about person in the American media. Famous stars of different ages were competing over that title.</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s give him a round of applause then!\" Nick pointed to the buffet area. \"What are you waiting for, Qin Guan? Come on!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who had a piece of sausage in his mouth, was shocked when everyone\u2019s eyes were turned on him. He pointed to his own nose. \"Me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! That\u2019s Qin Guan. Clap for him!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was clapping their hands, just like people had done at Cannes. Qin Guan put down his fork and wiped his mouth. Then he got on the stage, bracing himself.</p><br/><p>Hilton had no idea what was going on. She was talking happily to Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>\"What will he perform? He looks so handsome on the stage!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei cast a supercilious look at her. She realized that things were not going well. Nick continued to exert himself.</p><br/><p>\"Was my song beautiful?\" he asked the audience, taking a flirting pose.</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"Did you like its feeling?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you want that feeling to get better?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>The general enthusiasm peaked. Some people were whistling as Nick kept speaking.</p><br/><p>\"Nobody has heard Qin Guan sing, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course not!\"</p><br/><p>The mysterious Asian model had only appeared on the cover of a magazine. Nobody had heard his voice. Most of the guests were members of the music circle, so they were curious to hear it.</p><br/><p>\"May we have the honor of hearing him sing at this wonderful party?\"</p><br/><p>\"Good idea!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

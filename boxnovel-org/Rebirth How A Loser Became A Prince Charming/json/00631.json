The hardships of living in that area could not be expressed with words. It was not surprising that they had decided to leave.</p><br/><p>After a few days, rhagades formed on Qin Guan's lips. His face felt rough, but he didn't give up. The Tibetan men realized that he was braver than they had expected.</p><br/><p>He could swallow up raw rabbit flesh and roll down a sand slope. Thanks to him, the shooting had been shortened and the final scene came to an end.</p><br/><p>The wind was blowing sand all over as Qin Guan knelt down on the ground and fixed his eyes on Ritai's corpse. There were no tears in his eyes, but everyone could feel his sorrow.</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Chuan hoarsely asked all 60 members of the crew to pack up their luggage. Everyone was really happy to be returning home. Qin Guan had become good friends with the natives though. \"Are there any poachers nowadays?\" he asked them on their way back.</p><br/><p>\"It's hard to say. They avoid the checkpoints, but they linger around the area.\"</p><br/><p>\"We have police stations protecting us here...\"</p><br/><p>An awkward smile froze on his face when he realized that this was true.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing will happen to us. We are only shooting a film here. Shall we go greet them?\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, it was just an accidental discharge!\"</p><br/><p>The shot helped them escape from the doomed desert. A group of poachers not far away heard the shot and stayed away. They always avoided large armed groups, so they left the scene of the crime with their harvest as fast as they could. On their way back, the crew came across some dead antelopes.</p><br/><p>Fresh blood was streaming out of their bodies, and their black eyes were wide in fear. The scene they had shot earlier had suddenly come true.</p><br/><p>The guards walked over and counted the dead animals with broken hearts. One, two, three\u2026 They were four hundred and five, including the cubs. That was the exact amount killed in their film. Reality was ugly and depressing.</p><br/><p>Everyone fixed their eyes on Lu Chuan.</p><br/><p>\"Let us know if you need anything, director.\"</p><br/><p>\"Cheer up! We'll finish the film as soon as possible.\"</p><br/><p>That was a desire shared by everyone.</p><br/><p>They reported the crime to the authorities right away. The young policemen started tracing the criminals with a bitter hatred.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked over to Lu Chuan. The two of them looked at each other for a long while, communicating their sincere thoughts that way.</p><br/><p>\"It's a good film. It should be shown to the world.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are a good actor. You've been born for the cinema.\"</p><br/><p>The two men embraced each other and the plain Tibetan men.</p><br/><p>\"You are welcome back anytime, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are our good friend. If you want to have a celestial burial, we'll find a temple for you.\"</p><br/><p>Thanks in advance...</p><br/><p>Farewell, Kekexili!</p><br/><p>When she left Qinghai, Sister Xue felt immediately refreshed. She and Yin Changtao had decided to travel around Beijing, as Yin had never been to China before.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned home to find his surprised parents there.</p><br/><p>\"Were you really shooting a film? You look like you've returned from a coal pit!\"</p><br/><p>His mother caressed his face with a sigh while his father patted his shoulder with a worried expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei's father seemed to be taking pleasure in his misfortune.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! He looks so ugly, Weiwei! Did he really go to Qinghai? He looks like he's returned from the South Pole!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hush!\"</p><br/><p>He kept laughing at Qin Guan until Cong NIanwei stopped him. Qin Guan struggled out of his mother's arms and exchanged a look with his girlfriend.</p><br/><p>\"Dad, mom\u2026 Let's talk about this tomorrow...\"</p><br/><p>Their parents returned to their hotel, leaving the apartment to the young lovers. They would start looking for a house the next day.</p><br/><p>All the cabs in the capital had been changed to Jettas and Santanas.</p><br/><p>Their first stop were the advanced apartments downtown. According to Qin Guan's memory, they would have the biggest potential. Most of them were in-stock houses with fine decoration. They were outstanding compared to ordinary residential buildings. After two years, the property developers had still kept some good houses in hand.</p><br/><p>Those would be Qin Guan's first choice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

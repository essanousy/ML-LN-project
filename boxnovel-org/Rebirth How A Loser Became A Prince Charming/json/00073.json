He is 186 centimeters tall. (Qin Guan had grown by 1 centimeter in half a year). Not that tall, more like average height. He is 19. Huh? He's studying at the Capital University of Finance and Economics, not at a modelling school. I should pay attention to him. Who said that models are not educated? Here is an exception.</p><br/><p>The photographer called Chen watched Qin Guan walk until he reached the backstage. \"Look at his figure! He's the perfect human. His shoulders, waist and hips are all perfect. Maybe I can invite him to work with me on my next project.\"</p><br/><p>Professor He pushed the photographer to recall him back to reality. \"Let's talk about the competition first. Pass?\"</p><br/><p>Chen nodded heavily. \"Definitely pass!\"</p><br/><p>As No. 22 walked out holding his head high, He and Chen looked up and had a discussion.</p><br/><p>\"He looks fine, but something's off about him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Compared to No.21, his legs are shorter, his waist is thicker, and his feet and head are bigger.\"</p><br/><p>No. 22 walked forward with tears on his face. My dear judges, could you lower your voices? I can hear you in this large, empty room. I'm so depressed!</p><br/><p>His fate had been decided before he'd turned around.</p><br/><p>\"Generally speaking, he is fine compared to the rest.\"</p><br/><p>\"There is nothing special about him. I can't decide. He's a maybe.\"</p><br/><p>A good young man, who would have normally passed to the next stage of the competition, had his application ruthlessly thrown into the undecided pile because of Qin Guan. No. 22 went backstage in low spirits. The first thing he saw was Qin Guan, who was putting on his pants.</p><br/><p>He walked towards him angrily with narrowed eyes. The charged atmosphere immediately attracted the surrounding models\u2019 attention.</p><br/><p>\"No. 22 is looking for trouble with No. 21.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why?\"</p><br/><p>\"He was just unlucky enough to get on the stage after No.21.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow!\"</p><br/><p>The onlookers watched the two of them meaningfully.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fastened the buttons on his jeans. Putting on his T shirt, he asked, \"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>No. 22 glared at him. \"Where are you from?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan answered automatically, \"Y city.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m asking about your agency!\"</p><br/><p>\"New Silk Road.\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible!\" No. 22 exploded. \"I work with New Silk Road, and I have never seen you before!\"</p><br/><p>The gossip-loving audience grew even more excited.</p><br/><p>\"What's going on? They're from the same agency?\"</p><br/><p>\"Possibly. They don't know each other. It\u2019s an internal conflict.\"</p><br/><p>No. 22 was quite agitated. Qin Guan said one word slowly, \"Subordinated.\"</p><br/><p>No.22 was so angry, his lungs seemed about to explode. That man is so annoying!</p><br/><p>If Qin Guan was new at New Silk Road, No. 22 would have avoided him in the competition. He happened not to be in the system, so they would have fought with their gloves off. He had made a promise to his agent that he would become the champion in the local final easily. What now though? No. 22 felt a little fatter, as if he had swallowed his promise.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan arranged his clothes in his bag, walked past No. 22 and asked an assistant, \"Can I leave to get some rest when the competition is over? When will the results be announced?\"</p><br/><p>The assistant answered carefully, \"On the same day. When the competition is over, the contestants can go wherever they like. They can just come back here and check the results. The contestants who pass the preliminary competition will be informed about the local final by the organizing committee with a notice. All they have to do is attend the final on the date and address stated in the notice.\"</p><br/><p>The rules were clear. Qin Guan nodded and got ready to leave with his bag.</p><br/><p>No. 22, who had been openly ignored, shouted angrily at Qin Guan like an aggressive rooster, \"You have no manners! I was talking to you! Why aren't you paying attention? Actually, I\u2019m also a New Silk Road model. I\u2019m your predecessor! These days people don't respect their predecessors!\"</p><br/><p>No. 22 was getting more and more agitated. He had been ashamed into anger, and his confidence had been hurt. He was waving his arms around, looking even more like a rooster.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed helplessly as he put his bag on his back. Those young men can hardly control their temper. (Please, your actual age is 19.) He shrugged at No. 22 with open arms and said without any sincerity, \"Hi, predecessor.\" Then he added, pouring oil on the flames, \"So?\"</p><br/><p>So? F*cking so! No. 22 was about to explode when Qin Guan went on, \"Any questions? In any competition, we depend only on results. Manners maketh a man, as you said yourself just now.\"</p><br/><p>No. 22's heart was pierced by his words, as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head. His liver was quivering. Shaking, he looked like he was about to say something. Before he could find the right words, Qin Guan walked out, leaving him alone in the empty backstage area like a clown surrounded by his audience.</p><br/><p>No. 22 looked left and right, picked up his bag and ran into the fitting room quickly. He was still in his swimming trunks. You bastard, wait and see! I\u2019ll make you die!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was quite relaxed. The competition had been more casual than he had imagined, which had fit his taste well. Sister Xue stood nervously in the corridor outside. She felt relieved as soon as she saw Qin Guan walking out with a relaxed expression.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gave her a summary of the future arrangements and told her about the farce with No. 22 backstage.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue sneered, \"Don't worry about him. Just prepare for the following competition. That guy can't handle you. If he's plotting something, he will regret it.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was curious about her confidence. \"Why? Sister Xue, are you a Mafia boss? Have I fallen under your protection by accident?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue poked at his head. His behavior had once again not lived up to her expectations. \"You bastard! I've told you time and time again to pay attention to the modelling profession, but you don't listen to me. Professor Li is your boss!\"</p><br/><p>\"Professor Li?\"</p><br/><p>\"Definitely Professor Li!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is she a tutor at the Capital Institute of Fashion Technology?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was so angry that she burst into helpless laughter. She patted Qin Guan on the back hard. \"A tutor? You have been her student for so long! Is that the only thing you know about her?\"</p><br/><p>Bang, bang, bang, bang...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got beaten again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

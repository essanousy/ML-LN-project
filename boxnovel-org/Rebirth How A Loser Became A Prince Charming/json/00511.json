Soon, Hilton\u2019s friends arrived.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan had expected, the famous girl had not gone there alone. Paris Hilton\u2019s friends were really famous, which made the pack of reporters get excited. They lifted their cameras and started pressing the shutters like crazy.</p><br/><p>Hilton had been waiting for Madonna and Britney Spears, the most popular female singers in America. Either of them could make the headlines of any newspaper by herself, let alone if they appeared in the same picture.</p><br/><p>By the time Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei looked up from their plates, the situation was even stranger.</p><br/><p>At Hilton\u2019s orders, there were some Spidermen hanging by the windows, blocking the light coming off the street lamps. The three ladies greeted and kissed each other.</p><br/><p>Qu swallowed her golden chips, murmuring, \"Those three here\u2026 What a coincidence!\"</p><br/><p>\"Coincidence?\"</p><br/><p>\"They are the two singers of the music video. They contacted me to invite you to shoot it with them. They are releasing an album together.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were stunned, when suddenly Britney turned her head around.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, isn\u2019t that the handsome guy we invited to our music video?\"</p><br/><p>The other two turned around as well. Hilton was shocked at first glance.</p><br/><p>\"Who is he? What music video?\"</p><br/><p>\"Our company will release a joint music video. Madonna found him while reading some magazines. We picked him to be the protagonist of our video. He must be an Asian model. That\u2019s all I know.\"</p><br/><p>As the other two stopped talking, Madonna warned them, \"Don\u2019t look down on him. There\u2019s gossip about him everywhere online. He is a Columbia student. Even his vacation trips attract reporters. He is really popular now.\"</p><br/><p>Paris Hilton's eyes were shining brighter and brighter. I like popular guys. I\u2019m the Gossip Queen after all!</p><br/><p>\"Shall we say hello to him?\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! You like him?\"</p><br/><p>Hilton nodded without hesitation. She looked like she had discovered her favorite kind of jewellery at an auction. He\u2019s mine!</p><br/><p>\"Let's go!\" Britney was not the sweetheart her agency made her out to be. She wanted to watch the whole world burn. She was as much of a rebel as Paris Hilton.</p><br/><p>Before Madonna could say anything, they stood up. Madonna couldn\u2019t help but sigh, shaking her golden-blond curly hair.</p><br/><p>The two princesses were really bold. Judging by their status and popularity, they could just wave at Qin Guan and the Asian model would walk up to them seductively. Actually, they didn't even need to approach the model personally. For the sake of their dignity, Madonna decided to follow the girls.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the reporters, they were just greeting some friends, not looking for a boyfriend.</p><br/><p>\"Hi, Qin Guan. Can we sit here?\"</p><br/><p>\"How are you, dear?\"</p><br/><p>Not good. I nearly choked. Qin Guan had an ominous premonition as he saw the looks the three ladies were shooting at him. When they had stood up and come over, he\u2019d almost choked on his tuna salad from the shock.</p><br/><p>\"Cough, cough...\"</p><br/><p>Qu stood up in time. \"Hello, I have met Linda from your agency. I am Qin Guan's agent.\" She had to protect Qin Guan from any gossip in this occasion. The Spidermen nearly crashed the windows in their effort to take pictures.</p><br/><p>This was breaking news. The three ladies had approached a mysterious young man together, greeting him warmly and urgently! This was headline material!</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Qu's Tai Ji didn't work. Hilton, who was a cunning girl, sat down in Qu's vacant seat, right next to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, I\u2019m Paris. Are you alone here? I have never seen you before.\"</p><br/><p>Her large innocent eyes sent him seductive messages. Cong Nianwei was invisible to her. Britney was a little annoyed. She liked bad boys herself, so Qin Guan was not her cup of tea.</p><br/><p>His raised eyes looked straight at her heart though. A good boy can also be a bad boy.</p><br/><p>Madonna was the calmest one among them. Smiling, she sat down across from Qin Guan, stretching out her hand. \"I\u2019m Madonna. Do you know me? We\u2019ll be working together tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>She was a real superstar. Even though Britney had won a Grammy, she was still a little girl.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s nice to meet you, Qin Guan. I\u2019m looking forward to working with you.\"</p><br/><p>The two of them shook hands. The reporters outside were disappointed by the blurry photos.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei noticed that Qu looked terrible. Her outstretched hand was ignored, left hovering in the air. Cong Nianwei, who knew the capable woman well, looked at Hilton with a sympathetic expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

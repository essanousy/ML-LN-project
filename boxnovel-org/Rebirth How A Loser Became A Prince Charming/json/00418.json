She did not care about the result.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, it sounds doable. It\u2019s been a long time since all the bosses met. You and Richard can take care of the details. First, make a schedule with the two boys.\"</p><br/><p>Their biggest issue had been settled by Qu in a dramatic way. She had promoted her model skilfully. Whatever the result, she would be the final winner.</p><br/><p>Richard couldn't express his feelings. He was itching to say something. That clever, mighty woman seems so charming right now! Surely, this doesn't mean I\u2019ve fallen in love with her?</p><br/><p>He shivered at the thought. Forget it.</p><br/><p>After the one-month winter vacation, schools opened again. Qin Guan was active at the beginning of the semester, but he did not join any new societies or do any voluntary work on campus.</p><br/><p>During their last meeting at Columbia, he had met many Chinese juniors and seniors majoring in Accounting. They were all going to interviews and getting internships by then, so they had mastered the basic level of knowledge.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was seeking part-time staff for large-scale statistics. He needed final results to carry out his analysing work.</p><br/><p>His firm had hired some part-time accountants for basic data calculation. This actually saved him on rent.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was too busy with work. As soon as he left the PWC building, he called Xu Xiaoxiao excitedly.</p><br/><p>Xu liked Qin Guan\u2019s ambition like a cat liked fish. He asked Qin Guan to come over.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan arrived at Xu's restaurant and found many people waiting for him there, including the young married woman who owned the general store next door, the Chinese supermarket owner across the street, and the massage parlor owner around the block... All of them were Chinese. Their eyes were glinting. Xu must have told them something before Qin Guan arrived.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, pretty boy! Are you good at accounting and reasonable tax avoidance? Have a look at my accounts. I have to submit a lot of forms to the government every month.\"</p><br/><p>\"American officials are so shrewd, young man. They charge my massage parlor so much at random...\"</p><br/><p>As they all complained loudly, Qin Guan looked at his potential clients speechlessly. Are you kidding, Xu Xiaoxiao? These people are not rich enough to hire an accountant!</p><br/><p>When he learned about their assets, income and property though, he realized he had underestimated them.</p><br/><p>What did Chinese people like to do after residing in a place for a long time? Purchase a house!</p><br/><p>Chinese people didn\u2019t understand the American concept of renting a shop. In Manhattan, where an inch of land was worth an ounce of gold, those store owners actually owned their own stores. They were great and powerful.</p><br/><p>After an initial evaluation, they all reached the lowest standard of a CPA, which was over one million.</p><br/><p>Each of them could only spend 6,000 dollars on basic CPA work, including dutiable goods declaration and annual verification. They could get at least 50% tax reduction though, so it was worthwhile.</p><br/><p>After experiencing what it was like to have a professional CPA, they wanted to sign a contract with Qin Guan's firm.</p><br/><p>Xu also hired Qin Guan for his restaurant, which would bring him a lot more profit. It was so generous of him!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s firm had actually reached the professional standards of a single firm, which was 100,000 dollars a year.</p><br/><p>From that day on, Qin Guan\u2019s QC accounting firm was officially open.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>A small grey sparrow flew down to the ground from a withered weed. It was getting higher and higher due to its ambition. There was still a chilling wind and the sneer of the bald eagles, but those things couldn't delay it from getting to its destination.</p><br/><p>In one day, it would transform though flourishing Chinese magic and reveal its real nature. It would become a splendid phoenix.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was working hard towards his goal. The Chinese students also appreciated the chance he had given them through their part-time jobs.</p><br/><p>The greatest obstacle for an accountant was inexperience. Experience was precious when seeking a job or applying for an internship. Although they weren\u2019t making much money and the job required lots of patience, they enjoyed it like malt sugar.</p><br/><p>Before, they had only known about American company functions in theory. It was Qin Guan who had given them the chance to put their knowledge into practice.</p><br/><p>Many foreign students had been attracted by his reputation, in hopes of getting an internship. Nobody cared about the low payment.</p><br/><p>As a result, Qin Guan had gathered many Chinese students, who were following his lead naturally.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s influence among the Chinese students made Zhang Dekai nervous. He paid no attention to Qin Guan's status in the fashion circle or his popularity at Columbia, but he attached great importance to his influence among Chinese students.</p><br/><p>This was because all clubs and societies would be having elections at the beginning of the semester, because the seniors had graduated at the end of the previous semester.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

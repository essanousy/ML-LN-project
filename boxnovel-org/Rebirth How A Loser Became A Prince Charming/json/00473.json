They can only be leading actors in B level films though. It's difficult for an Asian actor who started from an indie film to reach a B level.\"</p><br/><p>With those straightforward words, Martha put Qin Guan's paperwork back into a small archive cabinet. Thanks to his \"C\" mark, he could have priority for middle-level films.</p><br/><p>Although the award was important in any other country, it only carried a small weight in Hollywood. There was only one criteria there: commercial value. One might get a chance, but the box office was the final judgement. That was the strict law of the jungle. Nobody could deny it.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was busy in his decorated office. Xu Xiaoxiao, who was fascinated by Chinese Fengshui, had invited a master there as a gift for the new business.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan was arranging desks and chairs in the office, he heard the tinkle of the bells. A middle-aged man in a grey satin traditional Chinese garment and a pair black cloth shoes was standing by the door leisurely. He had a linen bag in his hand, and three threads of macrochaeta were hanging under his jaw.</p><br/><p>Xu invited him in respectfully. \"This way, master. Could you please check the Feng Shui in this office for my friend? Should we make any changes?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless. Cong Nianwei turned around, trying to hold her laughter back. Where had he found that guy? Lan Jin was also interested in him.</p><br/><p>The sage-like man accepted the title of \"master\" calmly. Holding his hands behind his back, he went around the office leisurely. His loose gown seemed to move with an ethereal lightness.</p><br/><p>After making a full round, the man stopped.</p><br/><p>He cleared his throat and stared at Xu. \"The structure of the room is quite reasonable. It\u2019s facing south\u2026 There\u2019s enough sunshine\u2026 Appropriate composition\u2026 High utility...\" He spoke with fervour and assurance. Cong Nianwei's shoulders were shaking with laughter.</p><br/><p>He looked like a realtor.</p><br/><p>\"However...\" The man stopped and folded his arms across his chest with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Xu looked scared. \"What's wrong with the room, Master Zhong?\"</p><br/><p>Master Zhong narrowed his eyes and smiled. \"I have advised your father many times in the past. I\u2019m not here to scare you. I\u2019ll help your friend.\"</p><br/><p>While they were talking heatedly, Qin Guan waved at Lan Jin. Lan ran over to him and asked in a low voice. \"What's the matter? He is very interesting.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed to the master. \"Where is he from?\"</p><br/><p>Lan was good at spreading gossip. He got close to Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei and said, \"I drove them both here. They were boasting in the backseat all along the way. He was recommended by Xu's father\u2019s brother\u2019s uncle's nephew. He said he was an alumni of the Maoshan School [1] in China. He has checked the Feng Shui for many of Xu\u2019s father\u2019s stores. The stores are all flourishing. He is well-known in the Chinese circle.\"</p><br/><p>\"Xu is obsessed with traditional Chinese culture. He believes that there is still a phoenix deep in the forest.\"</p><br/><p>\"I hear that the Maoshan School is good at capturing ghosts. Are there any Maoshan Taoists now?\" Cong Nianwei asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lan grimaced. \"He said his branch practises Feng Shui. This is beyond me.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei exchanged a glance and decided to accept Xu\u2019s kind gift.</p><br/><p>Then Qin Guan told his staff, who were still working in the room, to take a break. They could continue after the master was done.</p><br/><p>Everyone found a chair and sat down to watch the drama.</p><br/><p>\"The building is too close to your neighbours. This goes against the diffusion of evil spirit. As time passes, it will come back to bite the staff working here.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were stunned. All the buildings on Wall Street were close to each other. And what was that \"evil spirit\"?</p><br/><p>\"Any ideas on how to avoid it?\"</p><br/><p>\"I suggest finding two mascots to place on both sides of the door. \" The master glanced at the transparent glass door and then added, \"You can put them inside so they don\u2019t get lost.\"</p><br/><p>Who would put two stone lions in an accounting firm, and who would steal them?</p><br/><p>\"Besides, the window glass on the building across the street is reflecting sunshine back into your office. This is not natural light. It might be filthy...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

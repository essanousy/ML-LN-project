Silence! Do your f*cking work! Move! Get ready for the next scene!\" The director cast a warning glance at Huang Bo.</p><br/><p>Huang bent his head and hid behind his script. He wouldn't miss the next action scene for the world. Perhaps you\u2019re wondering why there was an action scene in that show? Keep watching to find out!</p><br/><p>Pingr was torn by grief. She intended to commit suicide with the scissors on the table, but Jia Lian seized the scissors and shouted, \"No! I\u2019ll die with you!\" The two of them started wrestling together, fighting over the scissors.</p><br/><p>Huang's tiny eyes were shining with laughter. It looked like he was farting.</p><br/><p>Wang Xifeng was shocked. \"Second Master, calm down! Look at the bigger picture!\"</p><br/><p>\"You look at the f*cking bigger picture! You are always blocking the view from me!\" Jia Lian couldn't seize the scissors from a girl, so the three of them ended up wrestling together. What a mess it was!</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" the director shouted. He ran outside immediately, as if relieved from a heavy load. Huang was still laughing.</p><br/><p>Annoyed, Qin Guan took off his gown and told Huang, \"My work is done for today. I\u2019ll be free for several days. You have no lines left. What's your plan?\"</p><br/><p>Huang grinned and said in a self-mocking tone, \"I\u2019ll just be waiting for notices. I have to stay in the area and look for new opportunities.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had a flash of inspiration. He pulled Huang with him and walked towards Sister Xue, who was standing sleepily by the set. He wanted to introduce them to each other. That way, Sister Xue wouldn't starve when he left.</p><br/><p>He made a mutual introduction, which surprised them both.</p><br/><p>Huang was thinking, \"Should I get an agent? It's too early. Does an extra even need an agent?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was thinking to herself, \"What a joke! No brand will hire such a short boy as a model. And look at his face!\"</p><br/><p>After negotiating, Sister Xue had agreed to remain Qin Guan's agent until he left for the US. Then he wouldn't need to worry about the film or TV circle anymore.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan just wanted Sister Xue to give Huang a chance. The final outcome would depend on his talent.</p><br/><p>The shepherd didn\u2019t care about the number of the sheep after all. Besides, the new sheep was obviously a wild goat, so he would be much easier to deal with than Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue learned about figurant auditions from several crew members and made a tight schedule for Huang. She was unprecedentedly satisfied with his admiring expression.</p><br/><p>Compared to picky Qi Guan, Huang was by far the better actor. He was afraid of neither hardship nor fatigue. Besides, he asked for very little in a play. He was happy with one line or a close-up of his face. Could he become my next source of money in the future?</p><br/><p>In the flourishing film and TV industry, there were many similar groups doing business on their own. Neither Qin Guan nor Huang were famous at the time though, and big companies held such small fish in contempt.</p><br/><p>They had no desire to sign a contract with Sister Xue, so she and Qin Guan had been free and unfettered for a long time. Those wonderful days would be gone though, as Qin Guan's advertisements were aired on all TV channels.</p><br/><p>The pharmacy plant had invested a large amount of money in promotion, and the other two famous brands had done the same.</p><br/><p>The TV audience thought this was a strange phenomenon. Whenever they turned on their TV, no matter the channel, they would see that handsome boy.</p><br/><p>\"Xianqu Biscuits, your best choice!\"</p><br/><p>In the evening, a housewife saw the advertisement during the break of a cooking program. On the screen, Qin Guan was fighting with a cute dog over a package of biscuits.</p><br/><p>The woman swallowed her saliva as her tiny dog barked at the TV.</p><br/><p>\"Okay! We\u2019ll go to the supermarket after supper and buy those biscuits!\"</p><br/><p>The dog lay down on the floor again silently. Not long after, the woman stood up and prepared to go out. \"Still hungry? Let\u2019s have a snack first!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Another woman was watching her favorite health program, when she saw a snotty boy on the screen.</p><br/><p>\"Poor boy! He should go to the hospital at once!\"</p><br/><p>In one second, Qin Guan had already recovered and he was smiling at her, holding the XXX medicine.</p><br/><p>Absorbed in thought, the woman stood up and decided to buy the medicine. It seems to have a good effect! Don't judge it only by an advertisement, woman!</p><br/><p>It was late at night, and a young white-collar woman was lying down on the couch. She looked exhausted. Overcome by boredom, she turned on the TV to watch a midnight series. Suddenly, a naked handsome young man appeared on the screen.</p><br/><p>She cheered up at once. Sitting up, she fixed her eyes on the screen.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was in the shower. Water drops were flowing along the sexy muscles of his back and down to his slender waist. Qin Guan wiped the water from his face and turned around, facing the audience.</p><br/><p>It was a high-definition ad. The blue veins on the woman\u2019s hand, the one that was holding the remote, popped up.</p><br/><p>\"Turn around! Turn around!\" Chest. Abdominal muscles. The Adidas body wash. \"I love sports, but I also love taking a shower afterwards. Adidas body wash, the right choice!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As soon as they reached Qin Guan's villa in Beverly Hills, Sister Xue collapsed on the couch and started laughing.</p><br/><p>\"You could be a spiritual advisor, Qin Guan. You could empower others to do things!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't make fun of him. This is useful for his interpersonal relationships.\"</p><br/><p>Qu sat down on the couch as well.</p><br/><p>\"I have a question. Qin Guan has gotten very successful during these past few years, both domestically and internationally. His fans go wild for his looks, even though they are all sensible people. Don't you find this strange?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused. He had been away from China for a long period of time.</p><br/><p>\"What are you trying to say? Did something happen in China?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, yes. Americans don't pay much attention to the entertainment circle in China. This was a warning for everyone in the circle.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Andy Lau is innocent. He was just unlucky to have such a fan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly. Plus, the media added fuel to the fire. That crazy girl's father jumped into Victoria Harbor. They retrieved his corpse from the sea a few days ago.\"</p><br/><p>\"All this because Lau refused to meet Yang Lijuan. People say that Yang's father considered Lau unworthy of his daughter's affection. The mental and physical exhaustion, as well as all the money he had to spend to visit Hong Kong, made him commit suicide.\"</p><br/><p>Will the girl have to face reality when she comes back to her senses?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't know what to say about that incident. It went beyond human imagination. He could only sigh over Lau's bad luck. The public's sympathy for the weak would put a heavy burden on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"Actually, I think the media should take the blame. They stir up trouble all the time and force people to jump off cliffs.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. China is developing really fast, both financially and otherwise.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue suddenly recalled something. She rummaged through her bag and took out a piece of paper.</p><br/><p>\"Here it is. It's a new job offer.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is it? I don't want to agree to a new film at this stage. I have another film to shoot overseas.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not a film or a TV series. It's an offer from two different TV stations. It's said that they have been fighting over you for a long time. The salary has reached this amount by now...\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue showed Qin Guan her palm and then turned it over.</p><br/><p>\"This is the initial offer. They are not done fighting yet.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took the paper curiously.</p><br/><p>\"I know these shows!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had heard about them. They were both talent shows. The first one was the show \"My Hero\" on Dragon Television, and the second one was the show \"Supper Boy\" on Hunan Television.</p><br/><p>They were both nationwide shows that discovered talented young people. They selected talented individuals for their subordinate agencies and tried to increase audience ratings and attract sponsors.</p><br/><p>Actually, participating in a talent show was the easiest and quickest way to make a fortune and become popular. All ambitious young people wanted that.</p><br/><p>\"What's the difference between the two?\"</p><br/><p>\"'Supper Boy' focuses on musical talent, while 'My Hero' looks for personal qualities that are useful in film and TV.\"</p><br/><p>\"Last year's winner was Purba Rgyal. He could become famous in the future. It's interesting, because this program arranges special lessons for each contestant. The audience watches as the frog turns into a prince.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

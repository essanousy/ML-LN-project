Her mother had found the crew by getting five different cars.</p><br/><p> When they started talking about cars, Lin Zhiying\u2019s expression changed. As a racing driver, he was crazy about cars.</p><br/><p> \"Hey, Qin Guan. Did you see her mother's car? This evening I\u2019ll show you something interesting under that hill.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan nodded in confusion. The director was shouting at somebody. His voice had attracted their attention. Nobody saw a small head emerge by the hillside not far away.</p><br/><p> The entertainment reporter was not afraid of hardship or exhaustion. He had followed Liu's mother uphill to get the scoop. That disputable actress seems to be a second-generation rich kid!</p><br/><p> His conclusion was perfect for sensationalization. She would make headlines that night. Compared to her, Qin Guan would be lucky to even get mentioned in the news.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan had no idea about his place in the local newspaper. He was concentrating on taking a beating. He was sent flying backwards and fell to the ground hard.</p><br/><p> Xuzhu was holding a white chess piece in his hand blankly. Director Zhang made another close-up to his face.</p><br/><p> Words couldn't express his assistant's feelings for his simple shooting skills. Director Zhang liked films of high resolution. Everyone's face could be seen clearly on the screen.</p><br/><p> Some people called it realism, while others just laziness to edit. As a result, the actors could do nothing but compete against each other\u2019s acting skills.</p><br/><p> Carefree School stressed on appearance. In the original work, Xuzhu had been rejected by the person in charge, Wuyazi, for his ugliness.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was renowned for his beauty though. The actor who played Wuyazi changed his lines a little. \"Only your looks meet my criteria.\"</p><br/><p> Director Zhang explained that his remark would have to imply a meaning opposite to what the original said, or he wouldn't be able to explain Qin Guan\u2019s looks.</p><br/><p> Finally, Qin Guan got his power of 100 years. What a lucky guy!</p><br/><p> He also got the master position, as well as volumes of martial arts. As a simple monk, Xuzhu refused to accept the position. Little did he know that his master and Su Xinghe had died by Ding Chunqiu's poison.</p><br/><p> It was the first time that he deeply hated somebody. In the end, he took charge of the Carefree School.</p><br/><p> The whole show had been completed. Everyone started packing up tiredly. They would return to their base to get some rest.</p><br/><p> After two scenes, they would fly to Dali in the Yunnan Province.</p><br/><p> The whole crew admired Qin Guan, who had just joined them in time for the trip. He hadn\u2019t had to stay in simple dwellings or hotels under the hill, or sleep in a tent on the mountain.</p><br/><p> Even the main actor, Hu Jun, and the actress Liu Tao had had to sleep in a tent for several days.</p><br/><p> Some of the staff would whisper to each other with meaningful smiles. According to some people who had woken up at night, the two actors were having a secret affair.</p><br/><p> Hu Jun was famous for cherishing his family though, so people were uncertain about the relationship.</p><br/><p> On the way back, Lin told Qin Guan again, \"Wait for me in your room when you finish dinner. I\u2019ll take you to an interesting place. Don't go to sleep.\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was curious. He had never participated in any night activities with a crew member before.</p><br/><p> Huang shared the same room with Qin Guan. Of course, they didn't share the same bed. Cong Nianwei would blame him, even if the other guy was Huang Bo.</p><br/><p> There were two single beds in the room. It was the best accommodation in the village.</p><br/><p> Director Zhang never made a bad investment.</p><br/><p> The meals were also included. The cook in the kitchen had counted the lodgers in order to prepare dinner for them.</p><br/><p> Zhejiang cuisine was one of the top eight most famous Chinese cuisines. It was known for its fine taste and sweetness. The rich culture of Zhejiang gave cultural meaning to the dishes.</p><br/><p> It was called the scholar of Chinese cuisines. Visitors would taste both delicious food and traditional culture.</p><br/><p> Luckily, Qin Guan had had authentic village dishes down the hill, which was quite different from those in the urban area.</p><br/><p> Shaoxing braised meat, Chinese eddo with dried small shrimp and sweet and sour fish were all famous specialities. Of course, as a guy who preferred a large meat loaf, Qin Guan liked Dongpo pork the best.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

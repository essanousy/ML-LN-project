Compared to those girls, who had big eyes and fair skin, she looked like an ugly duckling.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue felt tender as she saw the anxious flame in her narrowed eyes. \"Why are you still here, Lv Yan? We have so many models, but only one assistant. Follow us. Quick! You can clean this up when we return.\"</p><br/><p>Grateful, Lv followed everyone out. She knew Sister Xue had given her a chance.</p><br/><p>The sky was completely dark and all the lamps around the square were lit up. When their makeup was ready, the supermodels gathered backstage. During the weeks they had lived together, they hadn't become friends. They were each other\u2019s arch enemies.</p><br/><p>Born in a country full of confident people, each girl was sure about her own strength. They believed that their failure didn\u2019t imply inferior ability. </p><br/><p>There would be disputes, which the audience loved. When they were alone, the cameras recorded their real opinion on the others.</p><br/><p>\"This is pure lesbian discrimination. Models like me are very elegant,\" said the only model with a different sexual orientation.</p><br/><p>\"May God never forgive those infidels!\" said a sincere Catholic, who claimed that she had devoted herself to God and refused to take off her clothes for a nude photoshoot.</p><br/><p>\"Are you kidding? How can a woman like her be one of the two finalists? She never cleaned the dormitory! She applied olive oil to her body and didn\u2019t bathe for days!\"</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s room looked like a pigsty. Dirty underwear was lying everywhere on the floor. Even the photographer shivered. It was so disgusting!</p><br/><p>\"She looks like a whore with an enchanting smile. I\u2019m a real professional, perfect for both commercial and high-end jobs.\"</p><br/><p>Before the final competition, the two girls taking part had already torn each other down. That was the highlight of the program.</p><br/><p>As the hostess, Tyra Banks was busy backstage. Qin Guan, who was sitting under the stage enjoying himself, finally saw the Chinese group.</p><br/><p> Sister Xue was wearing a purple suit. Surrounded by a group of girls, she walked up to Qin Guan proudly and sat down next to him.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s bloody hot in New York! It\u2019s the same in China. I\u2019m dying.\" Fanning herself with her handkerchief, Sister Xue looked at her beloved warrior.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was wearing a formal grey suit, a white shirt and brown leather shoes. Such a handsome guy.</p><br/><p>She gestured behind Qin Guan. \"These are your younger sisters. This is Du Juan, the No.1 model of New Silk Road. Say hello to each other. They need your help and guidance here in America.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around and saw a commotion.</p><br/><p>Du Juan\u2019s fair skin blushed under Qin Guan's eyes. It turned pink, pinkish, purplish red... Sweat slowly appeared on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, sir...\" the slender girl murmured.</p><br/><p>The other girls were in an even worse situation. One had difficulty breathing, one collapsed on the ground, and a third one couldn\u2019t speak. They had all gone crazy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned to Sister Xue helplessly. \"Are these the best models in China? Do they expect to survive in America with such a mentality?\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue shot a supercilious look at him. \"They are all your fans. They grew up hearing inspirational stories about you. It\u2019s common to go mad when you meet your idol.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was speechless. Suddenly, he felt strange. Who did I just see among these girls? He slowly turned around again and found the only normal girl.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, tall lady! Yes, you! The one with the freckles! May I know your name?\"</p><br/><p>Lv Yan was surprised to see the legendary model talking to her. She pointed to her own nose. \"Me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Are you also a model?</p><br/><p>\"No, no! I\u2019m a newly-promoted assistant. I was a cleaner before,\" Lv Yan hastened to explain.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't say much. He just turned and whispered to Sister Xue, \"In my opinion, Americans would love Lv and Du.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Did you call us?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, help us! Our model is surrounded by crazy fans. Disperse them before they kill him!\"</p><br/><p>The first policeman to get out was a new recruit. After hearing the alarm, he rushed into the store to save the poor victim.</p><br/><p>At the sight of the crowd, his partner, who was a veteran, returned to his car. \"This is PA4769. We need support at 998 Times Square... A gathering crowd is causing havoc... Yes!\"</p><br/><p>The policeman lit up a cigarette as he stood by the entrance calmly.</p><br/><p>\"Who are they?\"</p><br/><p>In one minute, the young policeman squeezed out with scratches on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Young man, you have a lot to learn!\" The older policeman was not surprised. He just looked in the direction of the crossroads, his voice fading away as several police cruisers drove over to support them.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, let's start!\"</p><br/><p>The man took a loudspeaker from the backseat and shouted at the crowd inside the store as if they were robbers in a bank.</p><br/><p>\"Attention, please! The police is in charge now. Please walk out one by one. We were notified that there is an unlawful assembly here that is disturbing the social order.\"</p><br/><p>The excited people around them seemed shocked. They all exchanged surprised looks.</p><br/><p>They were an experienced, sophisticated group that had been following bands on tour and attacking celebrities. The police was no threat in their eyes.</p><br/><p>They went out in a line with their heads held high, as if they were victorious generals.</p><br/><p>\"Line up facing the wall! Lilith, check for weapons!\"</p><br/><p>\"You have inflicted illegal damage to commercial stores and meddled with public security... Write down your names here. They will be transferred to the police station records later.\"</p><br/><p>\"As for you...\" The policeman put out his cigarette on the ground and pointed at Qin Guan, who was walking out with wobbling steps.</p><br/><p>\"You were the cause of the riot. Follow us to the station!\"</p><br/><p>Guo, who was used to the kinder manners of Chinese policemen, was stupefied.</p><br/><p>\"But he is the victim, sir! He is all right now. Can't he leave?\"</p><br/><p>\"No way! I have to file a report. He was involved in the riot, so he is obliged to cooperate with us. Follow me. When the procedure is completed, we will let you go. You have to follow us too, sir!\"</p><br/><p>He had just finished his words, when a MINI pulled up to the side of the road. Qu got out and shouted at Qin Guan, \"You have to follow them! Can I drive him to the station, sir?\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure!\"</p><br/><p>Guo asked his men to clean the store and move on with the operation. Then he sat down in the backseat, murmuring, \"I should ask Xu Xiaoxiao for help, but I have to go to the police station now.\"</p><br/><p>Qu shot a supercilious look at him and destroyed his illusion.</p><br/><p>\"They will turn this into a real gangster fight... Nobody will be able to save Qin Guan. The media will be over the moon.\"</p><br/><p>Guo was shocked, but Qin Guan, who had remained silent for a long time, turned around calmly.</p><br/><p>\"According to my observation, the fans didn't want to hurt my face.\"</p><br/><p>He seemed proud. \"So they hurt your body instead?\" Qu asked, fixing her eyes on the road ahead.</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the car. Guo sized Qin Guan up from head to toe before he turned his eyes away.</p><br/><p>The red hoodie Qin Guan was wearing had been torn apart. His shoulders were visible through his collar and his sleeves were no longer the same length.</p><br/><p>Qu cast an unconscious look at Qin Guan's pants. At least they were still intact. She tried her best to hold her laughter back.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't enjoy any special treatment at the police station, even though he was a celebrity. Qu called Cui Ming, who was his lawyer, while a receptionist came over with a pile of forms.</p><br/><p>\"The person who caused the riot and the one who called the police have to fill in these forms. Am officer will come and take your statement later.\"</p><br/><p>This was the standard procedure. When she looked up carelessly, she noticed that the guy before her looked familiar.</p><br/><p>\"Are you that Asian model on TV? What's your name? Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>It wasn't her fault that she was ignorant. After a busy day at work, she preferred to go to sleep or go out with their girlfriends. She had no time to pay attention to the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's me.\" Qin Guan fixed his eyes on the forms. After suffering under the hands of those crazy music fans, nothing could scare him anymore.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he had underestimated his appeal. The policemen did not worship him like an idol, but they loved to gossip about celebrities.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

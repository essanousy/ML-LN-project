Her back was turned to the camera.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's shirt was wrinkled and the buttons were unfastened, revealing his strong chest and sexy muscles. His legs were open unscrupulously. He looked completely lost and heartbroken.</p><br/><p>Natalie performed a beautiful split and exposed herself to him.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was scared, but the whole crew was pretending to work carefully.</p><br/><p>They had to act like this. They loved watching a girl strip dance for free!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was holding a slender glass in his hand. He took a 10-pound bill out and stuffed it into the black silk stocking on Natalie\u2019s leg. The girl with the purple wig cheered up and started dancing even more vigorously.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan lowered his head and buried his face into his hands, hiding his expression. The powerful man had burst into tears. </p><br/><p>\"Is he really sobbing, or is he just pretending?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. Let's check later.\" The man was too busy appreciating the beautiful dance to cry.</p><br/><p>Where is your dignity?</p><br/><p>Nichols was very confident about Qin Guan though. Crying should be nothing for him considering his Best Actor awards. </p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't disappoint him. He looked up with tears running down his face, his bloodshot eyes and red eye sockets expressing his sadness.</p><br/><p>Natalie seemed absorbed in his sorrow. The same grief was evident on her face.</p><br/><p>The two outcasts were like two hedgehogs. They couldn't get close to each other for fear of getting hurt.</p><br/><p>A 10-minute dialogue followed. It was difficult to deliver long lines, but they did so perfectly.</p><br/><p>No one on set, including idlers like Sister Xue, focused on Natalie\u2019s body. They were all attracted by their splendid performances.</p><br/><p>The cameraman recorded the scene calmly. He didn\u2019t come back to his senses until the actors had finished all their lines.</p><br/><p>The director started shouting at them happily. The complicated scene had been completed smoothly!</p><br/><p>This was a success for Qin Guan, who hadn't realized when he had stopped acting.</p><br/><p>Natalie didn't move. This was their last scene in the film, so there was a cantankerous sparkle in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Disaster is imminent!</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could escape, Natalie hit him again!</p><br/><p>\"Well done, Qin Guan! Your performance exceeded my expectations! I was completely captivated! How did you do that?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan grimaced helplessly. He had learned a lot from that Shakespeare play on the beach, as well as the play he had watched on Broadway.</p><br/><p>He had a general idea of what Nichols wanted from him. Unlike his implicit performance in other films, good acting skills were essential this time.</p><br/><p>He would rather call \"Closer\" a play than a film though. Plus, he liked competing with other actors while filming.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue showed up in time to save him from the girl.</p><br/><p>\"My agent is here!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pointed to Sister Xue, who was waving at him, and left the girl as fast as he could.</p><br/><p>The director was talking to Sister Xue happily. At the sight of his favorite actor, he gestured and said, \"Let's call it a day. Your last scene is tomorrow, so you can go around London in your free time.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan forced a smile at Sister Xue's silent threat and left reluctantly.</p><br/><p>I have no time to idle around.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, there's nothing else for you to do now. Just tell me why you told me to take a look at that street!\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue and Qin Guan were walking slowly along the bustling narrow street, which was filled with all kinds of stores and restaurants.</p><br/><p>\"Take it easy...\" Qin Guan looked at the stores carefully. As he passed by a pretty fruit stand, he picked up a green apple.</p><br/><p>\"How much is it?\"</p><br/><p>\"You just want one? Take it, it's a gift. I like handsome boys.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan washed the apple under a water pipe.</p><br/><p>\"Do you want it, Sister Xue?\" Before she could answer, he took a big bite. He had just wanted to be polite.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Suddenly, a group of heavily armed football players came over. Their leader was Joseph.</p><br/><p>\"Joseph?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? Cong Nianwei?\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m a student here!\" they all said in one voice.</p><br/><p>Why couldn\u2019t they talk about business like ordinary people? They were too sensitive about their privacy, so they knew very little about their fellow students.</p><br/><p>\"What a coincidence!\" Joseph became serious when he saw the scene. \"What happened? Were you beaten? Who was the troublemaker?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan is the best cook I have met. I have to protect him for my stomach\u2019s sake.</p><br/><p>Joseph looked at John. That guy is famous in college. He must have been competing with Qin Guan over the girls. Qin Guan was alone, so he was defeated.</p><br/><p>Joseph cast a glance at Susanna and Wendy. Those easy b*tches! They always try to flirt with that handsome boy!</p><br/><p>Joseph handed his hamlet to a strong black boy who was under his command and strode over to John.</p><br/><p>He looked at John with his cold grey eyes, showing him his strong chest. \"Hey, boy! Qin Guan is my brother. Don't cause trouble for him on campus.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, there must have been a misunderstanding! Qin Guan just saved Wendy. That\u2019s why everyone is shocked.\"</p><br/><p>John did not look nervous. He wasn\u2019t afraid of anyone on campus. The two guys were from two different worlds. If he knew Joseph better, he would have been more careful around the German.</p><br/><p>\"It's just a misunderstanding, Joseph. Are you here for training? Just go, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019ll tell you the whole story at supper.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved at Joseph, gesturing for him to go away.</p><br/><p>\"Really? I\u2019ll bring some wine. What's for dinner tonight?\"</p><br/><p>\"Meat and rice!\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" Joseph left, swallowing his own saliva. He didn't forget to make a suggestion though. \"I liked those potato threads!\"</p><br/><p>Poor boy.</p><br/><p>The dancing teams left for another place. Qin Guan decided to continue their trip around campus.</p><br/><p>John and Susanna led the way, when suddenly Wendy, who had remained silent for a long while, said, \"Thank you very much, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>She took out a pen and wrote her phone number on Qin Guan's arm.</p><br/><p>\"This is my number. I\u2019m a postgraduate student at the Media Studies Department. I think we are in the same semester. You can call me if you need anything.\"</p><br/><p>Biting on her lips, the beautiful girl added, \"Are you a foreign student? I\u2019ll be in the dancing studio on the second floor. Everybody knows where it is.\"</p><br/><p>When she left, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei followed John to the main building.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\" Cong Nianwei asked in a soft voice.</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>\"I have told you to behave yourself. Don't act like a peacock! Wendy is acting too strange around you.\"</p><br/><p>Your Majesty asked me to save her, but now Your Majesty is suspicious of me.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt wronged. \"Impossible! We idled on campus for half an hour. I\u2019m just good at acting now. I\u2019m not flirting with other girls. Besides, we are strangers here!\"</p><br/><p>His words convinced Cong Nianwei, and they continued their trip.</p><br/><p>The character of a college lay neither in its lofty, magnificent buildings, nor in the beautiful scenery on campus. It was the ordinary details that showed the university\u2019s humanistic concern for its students. </p><br/><p>Sure enough, the student dormitories were plain even at Columbia University.</p><br/><p>Independent American students were inclined to live outside campus after spending several months there.</p><br/><p>Plus, the dormitories were a rare resource. You had to apply one year in advance. With enough good luck, you might manage to get a key.</p><br/><p>However, their first stop on their traditional campus trip was still the dormitories. After all, there would be quite a few of their fellow students living there.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan entered one of the dormitories and saw the master, a strong man with a beard, who was calmly typing on his computer amid a pile of rubbish.</p><br/><p>It was a double room of about 10 square meters. The gap between the beds was wide enough for one person to walk through.</p><br/><p>There was an independent washroom, which was good if one neglected the strange smell.</p><br/><p> John, who was familiar with the scene, led them to the next building. The rooms there were all the same.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by the next building though. There was a 24-hour gym with top equipment, and it was for free!</p><br/><p>There were all kinds of equipment, including yoga, aerobic gymnastics, free sparring equipment, and so on. The university had made great effort to enrich the students\u2019 lives after class.</p><br/><p>On the first floor, there was a giant swimming pool with diving towers and boards. A city sports meeting could be held there.</p><br/><p>After their visit, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei were confused. Should we go to university just for education?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

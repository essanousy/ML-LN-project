In Los Angeles, In-N-Out Burger was the best choice. It was just like McDonald's in China.</p><br/><p>Thanks to its simple food, the Southern California hamburger chain met the strange needs of the natives. There, one saw people eating hamburgers everywhere around them. It was hard not to be influenced by them.</p><br/><p>As a foodie, Qin Guan was deeply influenced by a strong young man at the cash register. The fat man weighed a full 100 kilos, but felt no shame in blocking the view of everyone behind him. He was living proof of what a real foodie could become through hard effort.</p><br/><p>There were three kinds of hamburgers on the menu: hamburgers, cheeseburgers and two-plus-two burgers (which included two meat patties and two slices of cheese). No matter how big one\u2019s stomach was, one two-plus-two burger would be enough for them, as one could also add anything they liked to their burger.</p><br/><p>The extra patties cost about 1.09 dollars each, which was a reasonable price. </p><br/><p>\"30 patties and 30 slices of cheese, extra mayonnaise and vegetables...\"</p><br/><p>The waiter did not look surprised by the order as he typed on the keyboard quickly.</p><br/><p>The hungry lovers waited about 10 minutes for the fat man to finish. When they took a seat with their own tray, they forgot to eat. The sight of the giant hamburger that guy had ordered was astonishing.</p><br/><p>They were curious about how he would eat it. The burger was almost half-a-meter tall.</p><br/><p>The guy took out a patty and a slice of cheese from the burger and swallowed them along with some lettuce. He ate it all piece after piece!</p><br/><p>Why did you even order one burger?</p><br/><p>To save money! This way, the guy didn\u2019t have to pay for two burgers!</p><br/><p>That was what was amazing about that place. However, after someone had ordered a hamburger with 100 patties, the store had updated the rules and regulations, putting a limit of four meat patties and four cheese slices per burger. Unfortunately, that regulation wouldn\u2019t be put into practice until 2004.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei and Qin Guan finished their ordinary, yet delicious food as fast as they could.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the city felt like a seaside resort. Tourists could spend the whole afternoon on the beach, sleeping and relaxing.</p><br/><p> At sunset, the couple found a place among the crowd on the beach. There would be a free Shakespeare play presented by a local theater company.</p><br/><p>It was an outdoor play, so the night breeze was blowing gently as they watched. The stage was on the soft beach, and the lights were basically some large lamps originally used by the staff of the beach administrative bureau.</p><br/><p>It was a simple play, but the actors were very dedicated. They were wearing wigs and dramatic makeup.</p><br/><p>The partings and reunions of the characters shocked Qin Guan, who knew very little about Shakespeare.</p><br/><p>During the break, the director approached the audience to invite one of the tourists to guest star on the play. It would be a very interesting experience.</p><br/><p>\"Is there anybody who wants to act with us?\"</p><br/><p>There were some heated responses.</p><br/><p>\"What's next?\"</p><br/><p>\"We want to know what the role would be. Is it too difficult?\"</p><br/><p>Although everyone was curious, they were also afraid of making a fool of themselves before an audience.</p><br/><p>One had to know oneself and their enemies.</p><br/><p>The bearded director was smiling cunningly.</p><br/><p>\"Alas! It's a very famous play and a favorite of romantic girls all over the world. Which play do you think it is?\"</p><br/><p>\"Romeo and Juliet!\" a loud yell echoed all around.</p><br/><p>\"Bingo! It\u2019s a very popular play. Most people have played it in middle school. Are there any volunteers?\"</p><br/><p>However, the passionate audience was just as cunning. Someone in the crowd asked a question.</p><br/><p>\"There are so many characters in that play. Which scene are we talking about?\"</p><br/><p>What a smart guy! The director tried to tempt them. \"The one after Juliet dies. Who had a dispute with Romeo at the graveyard?\"</p><br/><p>\"Paris!\" the audience shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! Is there a confident young man who thinks he can fight Romeo?\"</p><br/><p>Most of the audience liked the role, as it had few lines and required only simple skills. Besides, the actor would interact with the heroine!</p><br/><p>\"Me! Me!\" everyone started shouting.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei nudged Qin Guan. \"Wouldn\u2019t you like to try a different performing method? Give it a try!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

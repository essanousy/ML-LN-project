Cong Nianwei kissed him on the face.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll celebrate my birthday two days in advance. I like your present very much. You are really attentive.\"</p><br/><p>What boy bought such practical presents for his girlfriend? No one! Cong Nianwei liked practical presents. Maybe she was a boy in nature. Qin Guan was an honest boy who could make her feel assured her in the future.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was excited by the kiss she gave him. The more he got, the more he wanted. He begged for more, but Cong Nianwei refused with a red face, \"I\u2019m only a teenager. You need to wait several years!\"</p><br/><p>F*ck! It\u2019s your birthday! I even dressed up as a present. He wanted to have some dessert for comfort.</p><br/><p>He finally found the birthday cake between the printer and the computer. The box had been crushed. He took out the distorted cake resentfully. I\u2019m the most stupid man in the world! I got the wrong date and I destroyed the cake!</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei smiled. She scraped some light cream with her finger and tasted it. \"Wedome? [1] I like it!\" Qin Guan had a bite of cake from her hand. It was like a sweet dance of red strawberry and whipped cream. \"Happy birthday! I love you.\"</p><br/><p>Night fell. Qin Guan lit several candles, and the young couple watched them burn, their shoulders and heads touching. They wished that time would move more slowly. After many years, they would still recall that moment vividly.</p><br/><p>The wheels of time turned, and ordinary life went on. On the next day, Cong Nianwei was busy with work, while Qin Guan had to run for the Fashion Week.</p><br/><p>He had to try on outfits, negotiate, rehearse, adjust, check the stage\u2026</p><br/><p>He was really tired, but he didn't regret his choice.</p><br/><p>He suffered from the alienation of the models from the other two Asian countries and the hard intensity of work.</p><br/><p>He would only be a few minutes on the stage, but the preparation was a long, boring process. Sister Xue turned down screen tests for small parts on TV.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had read the scripts. He had no wild dreams for the small screen, but the titles of the plays were still ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\"Women Soup\", \"Dangerous Sisters\", \"Lottery Dream\"... What the hell were they even about? Besides, the roles only had one line. It was strange that Qin Guan was famous for period plays, when the plays mentioned were all modern.</p><br/><p>They were all evil characters with good looks. Sister Xue also expressed her worry about it. Zhang Chanzong and Yang Lianting had limited Qin Guan's choices, so they had to tread carefully. He had to focus on maintaining his fame, not promoting it.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had not logged in on the internet at all. He had no idea about his fame on the Haijiao Forum. On the other side, he was sneered at on the Goupu Forum, Hanjiao\u2019s rival website. The two forums were always in dispute for appealing to different audiences.</p><br/><p>The guys on Goupu were annoyed by the silly girls on Haijiao, and they began to photoshop Qin Guan's photos as a joke.</p><br/><p>Thanks to their dispute, Qin Guan had also become famous on Goupu. He had become a superstar on the internet by then.</p><br/><p>Cyber fame didn't influence him though. He was shocked by the Te-Tiger outfits. The brand is renowned for its traditional Chinese style. Why do I get the imperial robe and mandarin jacket?</p><br/><p>The cheongsam of his partner, who was a female model, was beautiful and charming, yet Qin Guan\u2019s costume\u2026</p><br/><p>Shao Xiaobing put on his gown with a smirk. He calmly caressed his jaw. It was trifle for him to trouble with Qin Guan. He had just told the designer which models would be able to pull off that costume in his opinion. Distinct characteristics sometimes were a double-edged sword.</p><br/><p>Work had to be treated seriously and models had no right to question designers. Qin Guan wore a skullcap and attached a coronet braid to the back of his head.</p><br/><p>He looked tragic among the other elegant models.</p><br/><p>Never mind the beauty of the embroidery or the shine of the imperial yellow. The costume looked really ugly among the costumes of different dynasties.</p><br/><p>Foreigners had a different opinion though. At the time, everything about China seemed mysterious to them. Chinese people had inherited countless treasures and inspiration from their history.</p><br/><p>The collection shocked the audience. It was scary, but not dangerous. When Qin Guan finished his first show, the designer hugged him excitedly in the backstage area.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] A famous bakery chain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

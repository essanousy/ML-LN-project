Ni Dalei, who was standing behind him, stopped him before he could get angry.</p><br/><p>Ni murmured something to him before answering the phone.</p><br/><p>Smiling, Ni sat in front of them and tried to persuade them, \"Think it over. Leave some space to each other and wait for a while.\"</p><br/><p>Wait for what? Qin Guan and Sister Xue had no idea, but Ni seemed nervous. The call had been from Two Sung Electronics, a South Korean company.</p><br/><p>The company exported its products, which included small household appliances, DV cameras and cell phones, to China, just in time to catch up with the lastest trends in electronic appliances.</p><br/><p>They were unsatisfied with their small market share in China though, so in 2000, they began to invest great capital in advertisements.</p><br/><p>The directors of their Publicity Department had seen Qin Guan\u2019s sample in the A.M advertisement company.</p><br/><p>\"Who is this model? He is really young and handsome.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Even better than Zhang Dongjian.\"</p><br/><p>\"We want him as our model.\"</p><br/><p>The director of A.M swiped his sweat away. \"You have so many products. Which one do you want him to represent?\"</p><br/><p>The man from Two Sung pointed at one of their products with certainty. \"This one, but we also have some additional items. Tell the model. If he agrees, we\u2019ll start at once.\"</p><br/><p>Wilful rich men! You haven't even seen our advertising plan!</p><br/><p>A.M had called New Silk Road, but that level of customer was beyond Ni\u2019s authority. He was only in charge of C level models.</p><br/><p>The director hung up and turned over the news in his mind in embarrassment. He had to negotiate with Qin Guan gently. There was a carrot in front his nose now. A.M assigned background model work to New Silk Road too. I can get mad over anything except money!</p><br/><p>His attitude changed all of a sudden. He returned to the table with large steps and picked up the formal contract again. Then he told Qin Guan naturally, \"What are you waiting for? Like I said, we can't yield to our opponents. I've decided to fight them! We won\u2019t abandon any model, even an affiliated one. We\u2019ll get revenge for you. I arranged an advertisement with Two Sung to compensate for your losses. Just do it, young man! Don't worry about anything.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue accepted the result. In her opinion, it was the best outcome for her and Qin Guan. It would be better for him if he didn't do part-time jobs before he became famous. Besides, Qin Guan would get an ad as a bonus.</p><br/><p>After receiving the shooting annunciate, Sister Xue waved farewell to the director and left the headquarters with Qin Guan. They were more scared than hurt.</p><br/><p>They didn't care about how the director would deal with Shao Xiaobing.</p><br/><p>The director of New Silk Road wouldn't let Shao go. That same day, Shao's agent received an internal warning from the company, commanding that he stop stealing their orders. The company also asked Shao to reflect calmly after finishing his current work. He wouldn\u2019t be getting any new offers anytime soon, except for original representing jobs.</p><br/><p>Shao wasn\u2019t angry when his agent informed him of the punishment. \"Shao, we are all tired these days. It'd be better if you took a break. The company also has some things to consider.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. I need to take a good rest. Don't worry, it won\u2019t be long. Soon those sons of bitches will be licking my toes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Why? What for?\" His agent was confused. Is he hiding something from me?</p><br/><p>Putting down his teacup, Shao explained happily, \"I have predicted the outcome. I knew that New Silk Road is no tame lamb, so I secured immunity for myself in advance. The Capital Fashion Week!\" he said before closing his mouth and tasting his tea.</p><br/><p>\"What?\" His agent was not as calm as Shao. The fashion week had first been launched in 1997 and had been getting more and more influential ever since. Plenty of overseas brands participated in the event.</p><br/><p>He turned around before the tea table in excitement. \"Great! If you can participate, I won\u2019t be worried about the force-out. There'll be no more than eight models attending the event from the whole company. Which interview did you pass though? An obscure brand won't do.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ne-Tiger.\" Shao smirked slightly in pride. \"And the other smaller brands I have cooperated with. If the other models didn\u2019t mind, I would like to build a bridge for the company.\"</p><br/><p>His agent relaxed. Shao had the best connections in the modelling circle. He always made friends with people who could help him, but seldom did he ever suppress somebody who was a threat to him.</p><br/><p>Those unlucky models were usually newcomers with no background. After several rounds, they were forced to the shallow waters before they could adapt to the deep sea.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan is the only exception. Is Shao's instinct too sharp? Or is it too weak?</p><br/><p>Against all expectations, Qin Guan had soared up to the sky with one jump. All the TV stations were playing his advertisement.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Shao to suppress him now. He had to jump higher to get out of this muddle. The Capital Fashion Week would be a good start. It would be better to change career though.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qin Guan was on his way to his dormitory. It was dark, and the hit song \"Leaving Sorrow to Myself\" was playing in his car. Qin Guan was swaying to the music helplessly.</p><br/><p>Too bad he was not gifted at singing. He was not tone deaf, but his voice was terrible.</p><br/><p>He had the typical Qin voice, which was low and magnetic, but broke at a high pitch. It was the so-called karaoke throat that failed at professional singing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We are leaving!\" Li Bingbing took Liu Jia for a cunning bitch who planned on using Qin Guan, so she stepped forward and protected Qin Guan with her body.</p><br/><p>\"Oh!\" Liu Jia came back to her senses at the sight of Li's cool, beautiful face.</p><br/><p>She took a step back, but stamped on the edge of the narrow carpet. The slippery rainwater and her plastic soles were what caused the tragedy.</p><br/><p>She slipped on the floor thanks to her heavy boobs. She could have kept her balance without the weight of her upper body, but...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan watched her fall down and stepped forward to grab her arm. Fortunately, he was able to pull her back before her body could hit the floor. Unfortunately, her tight wrapped skirt was torn in the process.</p><br/><p>At the sound of it ripping, Qin Guan looked down and saw the pink kitty on her underwear. He had not expected that. Such a sexy girl wearing cartoon underwear...</p><br/><p>He turned his head away like a gentleman.</p><br/><p>Li Jia tried her best to block the ripped skirt from sight as the reporters cast covetous glances at her.</p><br/><p>The star walking behind her felt like crying. No one was paying any attention to her. You are stealing the show! That\u2019s so cunning! Then she smiled again. That unlucky girl had gotten into big trouble!</p><br/><p>Li Bingbing smiled, taking pleasure in Liu\u2019s misfortune. She locked her arm in Qin Guan\u2019s and whispered to him, \"Shall we go?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed at the beautiful girl, who was busy hiding her underwear. If she had been an experienced star, she would have stood still and walked carefully, so the split wouldn\u2019t have been so obvious. She had hurried to cover it though, the result turning out to be the exact opposite of what she wanted.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan began to unfasten the buttons on his suit jacket. The fans outside started shouting.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! I love you! You are such a gentleman!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Give me your buttons!\"</p><br/><p>Stupefied, Li Bingbing watched Qin Guan take his suit jacket off quickly and hand it to Liu Jia.</p><br/><p>\"Put my coat on. Don't worry, it\u2019s bigger than your skirt,\" he said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>He was her savior. Fans were rushing up to the red rope, trying to slip through the security staff to get a closer look at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>In his white shirt and fitting suit vest, he looked even more handsome in the cold autumn breeze.</p><br/><p>The usher reminded them, \"Quick, Sister Bingbing! The next star will arrive!\"</p><br/><p>Li and Qin Guan exchanged a glance and locked arms again.</p><br/><p>The star following Liu Jia cried out. She had failed to catch up with them. Qin Guan and Li left in a natural manner, leaving Liu and her lonely follower behind.</p><br/><p>Both the reporters and the fans were satisfied with the funny incident.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Li Bingbing found their seats in the hall. In the spare time before the ceremony began, Li scolded Qin Guan, \"Are you silly? Others would have hid from her, why did you do that? If the reporters took any ambiguous photos, how would you explain them?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at her. No one had dared speak to him like that before. Not even Cong Nianwei's admirers or any cunning reporters.</p><br/><p>People were pouring into the hall. Liu Jia sat behind Qin Guan and Li Bingbing, a black Burberry coat covering her fair legs.</p><br/><p>She was looking at Qin Guan with a grateful expression. Her agent was chattering away beside her.</p><br/><p>\"What did you do? The company was planning on promoting you! Why would you do that during your first festival? Behave yourself and use your brain in the future! Otherwise, I can\u2019t help you!\"</p><br/><p>The noisy crowd calmed down when the host got on the stage. The screen lit up and the curtain rose. The Silver Eagle Festival had just begun.</p><br/><p>Everything went on in an orderly way, just like the previous years. Wang Jingcao, who was sitting at the side of the hall, smiled mysteriously. She had just received a call from Sister Zhao. The results had been as she\u2019d expected.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

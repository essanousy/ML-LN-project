He suddenly recalled Ou Qiang's sad face far away in China. Before he could consider it any further, Nichols shouted at him. It was time for his last scene.</p><br/><p>Forget it. No one can control their emotions...</p><br/><p>Qin Guan adjusted his blazer and sat down at his luxurious executive desk. This was his last scene in the film, as well as his only chance to face the other male actor. The camera started filming in the corner as Jude Law pushed open the door angrily.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had stolen his lover again.</p><br/><p>\"You are a rude man without any temperament or interests. Why don't you let your wife go?\" The bastard's figure occupied his whole pupils.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned his watch around calmly. He was sitting comfortably on the couch without any intention of standing up.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at Jude Law silently. The whole crew could feel the strange tension between them. It looked as if a junior assistant had met a CEO, a young officer had encountered the head of the nation, or a playboy had come across his strict father.</p><br/><p>No one could breathe.</p><br/><p>Even though Jude Law was a good actor, he was still suppressed by Qin Guan's vigor. Although his every movement, expression and line were right, he seemed inferior compared to Qin Guan's acting skills.</p><br/><p>Yes, the outstanding actor was inferior to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The director was hesitant. He wanted to stop them so they could repeat the scene, but Qin Guan made the final decision for him.</p><br/><p>His eyes were sparkling in the camera as if his wish had come true. He was bold and elated with the joy of vengeance as he delivered his cruellest lines.</p><br/><p>\"You took my wife away, but I got her back. I also made love with your ex-girlfriend Alice. We had a lot of fun together. We stayed awake the whole night...\"</p><br/><p>\"I didn't want to tell you those private things at first, but I will never forgive you anyway...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised an eyebrow at Jude with unreasonable contempt.</p><br/><p>Jude Law surrendered before Qin Guan's acting skills. All he could do was finish the scene uncertainly.</p><br/><p>\"Liar...\"</p><br/><p>He happened to be in the same emotional state as his character in the film. Both he and his character were on the verge of breaking down. He had finally earned some points himself.</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Nichols saved Jude Law, who was now completely out of breath. After shooting a meaningful look at Qin Guan, he left as fast as he could and tried to calm down in a quiet corner.</p><br/><p>In a few minutes, he had fallen under Qin Guan's control. He had lost himself and unconsciously followed the young man's lead. The feeling had been so terrible that he didn't want to relive it.</p><br/><p>Jude Law's team was busy around him as Qin Guan walked over to director Nichols to watch the playback with him.</p><br/><p>Once, twice...</p><br/><p>After watching it four times, the director looked up at the young man with a confused expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jude Law was more experienced than Qin Guan by a full 10 years, yet he couldn't rival Qin Guan's abilities.</p><br/><p>I was lucky to choose him...</p><br/><p>Jude was waiting for the director to ask them to repeat the scene, when he suddenly saw the crew pack up the cameras and props. His assistant walked over to them and then came back.</p><br/><p>\"The director said that the scene is finished. Well done! We still have time to shoot your scene with Natalie.\"</p><br/><p>Jude's cup paused before his mouth.</p><br/><p>\"So Qin Guan's scenes are finished?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, he has a very tight schedule. He will return to America as soon as possible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" The assistant saw a helpless weakness flash over Jude's face.</p><br/><p>\"He is the most talented actor I have ever met...\" he murmured to himself.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had no idea about Jude Law's opinion of him. He was just eager to return to his nest in New York. He had been away for seven days now!</p><br/><p>It was not just a distance over rivers and mountains, but also a distance across time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn't know that Sister Xue had booked a first-class ticket for him until the air hostess led him to his seat.</p><br/><p>That was so unprecedented for Sister Xue that Qin Guan felt the impulse to check if the sun had risen from the west that day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

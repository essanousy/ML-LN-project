The wooden shoes were a popular souvenir in the Netherlands after all.</p><br/><p>As Qin Guan walked in that pair of shoes, his each step produced a cracking sound. Walking like this was a test for his leg muscles. Thanks to his strong willpower and body coordination though, he was able to walk out of the hall and take the cab that was nearest to the exit.</p><br/><p>In 10 seconds, he had opened the door, taken off his shoes, gotten in the car and closed the door again. All the cab drivers outside burst into laughter at the funny guy.</p><br/><p>The car drove off, leaving Guo behind it, carrying the big bag alone.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan spent the next three days eating and sleeping. On the last day of the fair, the host was introduced to the legendary Asian sleeping prince.</p><br/><p>Although this was a far-fetched description, that was what Qin Guan looked like. The insatiable guy slept on blankets, couches and beds to show how comfortable their products were.</p><br/><p>Wang looked speechlessly at his sleeping face, while all the Chinese manufacturers smiled in pleasure at the orders they got. They were already packing for their return home.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had nothing to do after the fair, so he decided to stroll around the German city. Cong Nianwei had returned to China, so he had to buy her some gifts to show her his love.</p><br/><p>Frankfurt was renowned for its cider. The spirit was brewed from apples, just like wine was made of grapes. The production of cider could be dated back to the 1600s. Thanks to its low alcohol level and calories, cider was the favorite of female drinkers, which was why one could see cider bars everywhere.</p><br/><p>The producers added bubbles and powdered cinnamon to the spirit to create an even richer taste, thus making cider a must for tourists looking for souvenirs.</p><br/><p>If there was anything that could rival cider in Frankfurt, that had to be Frankfurt sausages.</p><br/><p>That name might sound unfamiliar to most people, but the sausages themselves were actually famous all over the world. They were the infamous hot dog sausages, which could be turned into a cold dish, a barbecue snack or a noodle combo. Some cunning pedlars even fried them on iron plates and sold them on the streets.</p><br/><p>The Chinese liked to serve them with chilli sauce and eat them on the go.</p><br/><p>Frankfurt sausages were a simple, convenient and cheap ingredient that everyone liked, so they certainly made Frankfurt proud.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wondered whether it would be stupid to take some sausages back home. Real foodies bought food from its place of origin after all.</p><br/><p>In the city and the suburbs, butchers would print a Frankfurt Sausage stamp on the packages. Qin Guan selected some traditional sausages with ham for his girlfriend. Cong Nianwei's soft hands unpacked them when he got home.</p><br/><p>After months of separation, the two of them were finally together again, They looked at each other silently by the breakfast table in the morning, sharing food and life events with each other in low voices.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei suddenly recalled something and gave Qin Guan a paper bag.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Xue sent this for you. She said it's a surprise, so I didn't open it. There seems to be a lot of stuff inside. What is it? It looks so mysterious!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took the paper bag. It was as large as a file cover.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

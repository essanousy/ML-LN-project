The model was embracing the spring spirit. With a wanton expression in his eyes, Qin Guan opened his arms, attempting to fly. That\u2019s wonderful! The click of the camera sounded again and again.</p><br/><p>The photographer shouted loudly, \u201cGood! That's right! One more pose!\u201d</p><br/><p>At his words, Qin Guan lay down on the floor at once. He curved his body slightly, his hands lying limply on his chest. His eyes were unfocused.</p><br/><p>The photographer was over the moon. \u201cThat's it! That\u2019s the spirit! This is nothingness and mystery! Okay, keep it. Okay. That\u2019s a wrap!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the word \u201cwrap\u201d came out of his mouth, the designer burst into tears. Her teachers had always told her that the work of a good designer could reach a delicate resonance in collaboration with the model. When she was in college, the designer had never had such an experience. Qin Guan had excellently explored the ideas behind her creations.</p><br/><p>She was extremely moved. The satisfaction of the completed work overwhelmed her.</p><br/><p>The boss had already walked away excitedly to have a glass of water. He had gotten thirsty just by watching.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was still murmuring to himself. Is this what being drunk is like? That's what I\u2019m familiar with. In my past life, when I used to sell machines, it was part of my job to drink with directors. You would be considered a snob if you did not drink. It was so simple for Qin Guan to recall that feeling.</p><br/><p>While she stood to the side and watched, Sister Xue did not feel as optimistic as Qin Guan. She had just realized what she had neglected right from the very beginning. Qin Guan had never received any professional model training. He was an amateur, self-taught model.</p><br/><p>On his first part-time job, Qin Guan had beat all the other models with his outstanding appearance and figure.</p><br/><p>But what about the other aspects of the job? Qin Guan had never practised the professional catwalk and he was unfamiliar with the background of the fashion industry. Plus, he wasn\u2019t aware of the ideas behind the designers and the brands.</p><br/><p>He makes a living off his face. I could pick up any random model from the bottom of the fashion industry, and their basic skills would definitely be better than his.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Sister Xue felt very agitated. She took a slightly flattened cigarette pack out off her pocket and pushed the door open to go out and have a cigarette. Then she came to a decision. She threw the lit cigarette down on the ground and ground it with her foot before she returned to the studio.</p><br/><p>By that time, Qin Guan had changed into his third shirt.</p><br/><p>It was a traditional formal shirt. The only difference was that it was black. Qin Guan stood still against the lights. Everyone could see the silver silk thread woven into the cloth, which reflected light spots under the light.</p><br/><p>The designer was proud of her inspiration. It was a subtle luxury that elevated the taste of the shirt.</p><br/><p>The boss was satisfied as well. The 80 Yuan retail price is a little higher than the original 60 Yuan price, but the cost is only raised by 2 Yuan. The shirt looks like a high-quality one. It\u2019s definitely worth 80 Yuan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the most relaxed in this series of photos. He wore glasses with golden frames in an elite conservative style. He didn\u2019t need to strike a pose, his serious expression was more than enough.</p><br/><p>The photographer finally shouted loudly, \u201cThat's a wrap! Let's pack up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The designer and the boss hastened to check the pictures. Sister Xue focused on the photos with the second shirt. She observed them carefully, letting out a long breath.</p><br/><p>Naturally, after the shooting Qin Gun got an extra gift. The boss was satisfied with the photos and paid him delightedly.</p><br/><p>While they were preparing to leave, he told Qin Guan to keep all the shirts he had tried on. This part-time job had become his clothing source for the whole term.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got into Sister Xue's car so she could take him to campus. Sister Xue talked to him while she drove, \u201cQin Guan, can I find a trainer for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was a little confused, \u201cA trainer? For what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Xue sighed, \u201cYour modeling foundation is unsteady. I suggest that we find a professional trainer to teach you. Your appearance won\u2019t get you every job. You have to improve yourself in order to make more money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded at the word \u201cimprove\u201d. \u201cI hear you, Sister Xue. You can make the arrangement, provided that you leave me enough time for my courses. It won't hurt to study a little more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was quite surprised with Qin Guan\u2019s reply. The little money grubber doesn\u2019t want to stop the part-time jobs and learn slowly. She had prepared a speech to persuade Qin Guan, but it was useless now.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got off the car, waved to Sister Xue and entered the campus. Seeing him off, Sister Xue found that she didn\u2019t understand the boy. She joked to herself, \u201cAnyway, at least he likes studying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his dormitory, arranged all his new shirts and then went to Huang Jiajia\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>It was her first lesson for the new term. Qin Guan had prepared a set of papers for each subject so he could make a revision test for her.</p><br/><p>Huan Jiajia was very confident about the papers. She listened carefully to the teacher at school. On the weekends, she had lessons with Qin Guan, and during winter vacation she had attended cram school.</p><br/><p>She had made a huge effort on her courses, which made her confident about the scores.</p><br/><p>After she finished the papers, Qin Guan announced the results.</p><br/><p>Chinese: 98 (pass)</p><br/><p>English: 80</p><br/><p>Math: 66</p><br/><p>Science:69</p><br/><p>Chemistry:72</p><br/><p>The total score was 385. She qualified for the College Entrance Examination for students who wished to take Arts Studies.</p><br/><p>As an ordinary student, Huan Jiajia might only be able to enroll at a junior vocational school with such a score.</p><br/><p>Huan Jiajia\u2019s mother was pleased. My daughter has made great progress. She could qualify for a junior college. Well done, Professor Qin! I haven't paid him for this term. I\u2019ll prepare 500 Yuan for him later.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia was also satisfied with the results. As a second grade student in senior high school, I can get a higher score next year. I have shortened the distance between Professor Qin and me by one small step.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded and said to Huan Jiajia, \u201cYou did well! Try to keep it up. If you can get a B or more in every subject in your general examinations in June, I\u2019ll take you to Carrefour and buy you snacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia jumped up at his words. \u201cReally? Don't mess with me, Professor Qin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded and patted her head once. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my promise. That\u2019s it for today. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had won the popularity vote once again with his free shopping cards. He had sent a box of snacks to Cong Nianwei\u2019s dormitory. Her roommates called him the local tyrant. As for the shameless people in his own dormitory, Qin Guan was ashamed to be one of them.</p><br/><p>They insisted on profiting at a rich person\u2019s expense and followed Qin Guan to do their shopping for free.</p><br/><p>You, Ye Dong, drop that MP3! Do you want to remain good friends with me? That cell phone was not on the shopping list!</p><br/><p>The design of the electric appliances at Carrefour was quite unreasonable. After they had finished their shopping, Qin Guan still had more than 1,000 Yuan left in his card.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia didn't know that she was the last one to benefit from Professor Qin\u2019s card. He is definitely encouraging me. That\u2019s when she decided to make more of an effort.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

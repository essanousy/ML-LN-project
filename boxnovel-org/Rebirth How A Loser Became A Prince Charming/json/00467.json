What are you doing here? Are you throwing me a party? Are there any presents for me? Or did you just realize the advantages of marrying me, Wei? Do you want to propose to this famous, handsome guy?\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei rushed up to Qin Guan. The crowd around her looked ready to explode. She would rather be with a normal guy.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s going on?\"</p><br/><p>\"Take a look at this.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan opened the newspaper and almost spit out blood. He tried to explain anxiously.</p><br/><p>\"Wei, this is a f*cking lie. It\u2019s nonsense! You know I have cooperated with Li Bingbing. If I wanted to date her, I wouldn\u2019t have done so in public.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know, don\u2019t worry.\" Cong Nianwei tried to comfort Qin Guan, who was about to go insane. Aren\u2019t I the victim here? Shouldn\u2019t I be comforted?</p><br/><p>\"I won\u2019t let that guy get away with it! What did the other newspapers report?\"</p><br/><p>Xu had bought several copies of other newspapers, where there were reports on the Cannes Best Actor winner without any gossip.</p><br/><p>\"This is fake news. He has to pay,\" Qin Guan said with a frown. Everyone agreed and began to make plans.</p><br/><p>\"That's right. I will get my hands on the original photos. There must be something wrong with them,\" Rongzhi said first.</p><br/><p>\"I know some good Chinese lawyers. This is a race discrimination case. They\u2019ll be killing two birds with one stone. They\u2019ll get famous through this case!\" He Ming suggested.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin didn\u2019t object to the idea. \"The best way is to root the enemy out. How much would it cost to buy The New York Times?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone fell silent at his shameless proposal. He was a lazy guy spending his spare time in an outside coffee bar, talking about a newspaper worth one billion yuan...</p><br/><p> It was both funny and stupid.</p><br/><p>He Ming stopped him. \"How much money do you have? Shut up and stand still!\"</p><br/><p>Xu was enlightened. \"If we can\u2019t inflict a critical strike to his spirit, we\u2019d better eliminate him in flesh. Does Han Zhujiu have any spare time? Has there been any human trafficking recently?\"</p><br/><p>Dude, can we talk about this in private? This is a crowded airport! People are looking at us as if we are idiots. </p><br/><p>\"I will discuss it with my agent. I think Qu is familiar with media conflicts in America. Then I\u2019ll come to you for help if I need any.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" Everyone was eager to do something. They would even risk their lives for him.</p><br/><p>Such funny guys!</p><br/><p> On the way back, Qin Guan got a call from Qu Xuemei. She had already formed her own opinion on the matter.</p><br/><p>The headquarters of VOGUE America were much larger than those in China. The building was more crowded and busy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was in Qu\u2019s office, learning about her way of dealing with things. She was his part-time agent in America after all.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll have a lawyer send a letter to the reporter and the chief editor of The New York Times.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan choked on his tea. Can\u2019t we negotiate with them first? That would be very rude!</p><br/><p>Seeing the doubt on his face, Qu said, \"This is America, not China. It\u2019s common to quarrel openly here. You don't want to promote yourself by taking advantage of this?\" She pointed a delicate finger straight up.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head firmly. I\u2019m not a small star relying on these affairs.</p><br/><p>\"You don\u2019t want to depend on the media for publicity?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head again. Such popularity would only do harm to an Asian actor. An inappropriate affair would humiliate him in the eyes of the public.</p><br/><p>\"People think that the Chinese like to pour oil into troubled waters. I\u2019m not that tolerable though.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head again and again. Qu looked like a lion ready to roar.</p><br/><p>No one could prevent a woman from fighting, unless they wanted to die first.</p><br/><p>\"No problem. I\u2019m always at your disposal.\"</p><br/><p>Qu felt a warm stream in her heart. Qin Guan trusted her... She knocked on the desk gently with her fingers.</p><br/><p>\"You don't need to worry about these things. You have powerful friends, don\u2019t you? I will give the case to Cui Ming, a Chinese lawyer. He has already accepted it because of your friend. You don\u2019t need to pay him either. He said some rich guy has already paid for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Only the phrase \u2018plain sailing\u2019 could be used to describe your life and career. The matter is settled. Go! I\u2019m busy now.\"</p><br/><p>Qu told Qin Guan to leave without hesitation. Beauties always cause trouble. He managed to cause trouble even at an award ceremony!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

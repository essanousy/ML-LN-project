The colorful pillows, which were embroidered with flowers, birds and Chinese characters, looked like artwork.</p><br/><p>Before he could try to touch them, Qin Guan suddenly opened his eyes. The man stopped in fear.</p><br/><p>\"Do you want this? Here you go!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pulled a few pillows from under his body. He gave the man one of each kind and then closed his eyes and went back to sleep.</p><br/><p>The man burst into laughter at Qin Guan's strange behavior.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, that's enough. I have to take a careful look. Your model's hard work certainly demands it.\"</p><br/><p>Wang, who didn't feel ashamed at all, answered politely, \"Of course, take your time. Our staff is as professional as our products.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Dong couldn't help but admire the girl. She would make a good politician.</p><br/><p>Thus, they received their first big order at the fair.</p><br/><p>Suppliers for 240 international stores ordered 72,000 pieces, with an average of 300 pieces per store. This included 18 kinds of products made by Chinese manufacturers.</p><br/><p>Everybody was really happy to make money. Their first success increased their self-confidence.</p><br/><p>Are our products too outdated for the international market? Could our skills and machines take the lead on an international level?</p><br/><p>Do our manufacturers have an advantage over our competitors? Are our patterns too boring?</p><br/><p> Chinese people liked to learn from other people's strong points and make up for their weaknesses. That's what they planned on doing at the fair as well.</p><br/><p> Several hours passed in the blink of an eye. Qin Guan woke up in the noisy hall and stretched out.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! That was wonderful! What time is it, Wang?\"</p><br/><p>\"Fifteen minutes before closing.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Qin Guan sat up in surprise and saw his assistant squatting next to him like a guardian.</p><br/><p>\"Did Ye Dong make any arrangements for me? Some small show, maybe?\"</p><br/><p>\"You did it by yourself just now. Everything is okay.\"</p><br/><p>\"You mean my sleeping?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" Wang turned around with sparkling eyes. \"It was perfect! Ye said that you could go on sleeping tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>What a wonderful trip! I get free dinner and free accommodation! Qin Guan bounced up from the ground.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go! Where is Guo Nuoyan?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm here. Wait for me! We can leave together!\"</p><br/><p>Guo pulled a large weaved bag towards Qin Guan with a proud smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Where were you the whole day?\"</p><br/><p>\"My boss gave me a secret assignment.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan suddenly realized that his shoes were not by the end of the blanket anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Where are my shoes?\"</p><br/><p>\"What shoes? Everyone put their shoes on this shelf when they came in to check out the products.\" Wang pointed at a shelf behind them.</p><br/><p>\"I didn't know. I just put them here by the blanket.\"</p><br/><p>Wang and Guo looked at that spot, which was a small path for shuttling customers and employees, when they suddenly heard Qin Guan cry out.</p><br/><p>\"My Hermes shoes! This was my first day wearing them! They were a gift from Coco Chanel! They cost 10,000 yuan!\"</p><br/><p>Wang and Guo looked at the heavy bags in their hands. What shall we do about him?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Ye Dong, who had just returned from another section of the fair, burst into laughter. He actually took a picture to remember this moment.</p><br/><p>So did Wang, who saved the precious photo on her phone.</p><br/><p>In the photos, Qin Guan looked gentle and elegant in his white suit. Of course, one had to ignore his tearful eyes, messy hair and stomping feet. Poor guy!</p><br/><p>After laughing, Ye Dong, who was a reliable man, solved the problem by getting Qin Guan a pair of big wooden shoes from a Dutch stand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

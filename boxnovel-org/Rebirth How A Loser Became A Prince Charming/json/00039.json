Qin Guan had been in hard pursuit of Cong Nianwei, but little did he know that he would be successful.</p><br/><p>He was the first boy in the dormitory to get a girlfriend. Wang Lei had bet that Qin Guan would not get a girlfriend in college. He had lost 100 yuan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished his washing and called Cong Nianwei before lunch. If the party was in the evening, then she would have spare time.</p><br/><p>The elections of the student union in the afternoon were extremely boring. There were only two candidates.</p><br/><p>The Vice Director of the Public Relations Department was a senior who had no time for the job anymore, so he\u2019d asked a freshman or sophomore to replace him.</p><br/><p>Using his charm, Ye Dong had gotten the position without much effort. He became the youngest Vice Director in the history of their university. As for his application to become a member of the Communist Party? That was a question that Qin Guan, who lacked any political consciousness, could not answer, but he knew his application had already been submitted to the University Communist Party Committee.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Qin Guan met Cong Nianwei at the entrance of the campus and introduced her to his roommates proudly. Under their envious expressions, they held hands with each other brazenly.</p><br/><p>They walked slowly to the Minzu Capital University, which was located three streets away from their university. The party would be held at the \u201cTyphoon Shelter\u201d tea house not far from there. At the price of 26 yuan per customer, people could enjoy beverages, cards games and mahjong private cabinets.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the Typhoon Shelter, the five girls of the other dormitory were already there.They paid at the cashier and ordered several drinks from the menu.</p><br/><p>Mu Lejiang was quite shy. He had met with the girl sitting opposite him during the train ride back to college, which had lasted 26 hours. Their hometowns were quite near, and the girl was very beautiful. In typical northwestern style, her characteristics were deep and clear, featuring angled eyes and a high-bridge nose.</p><br/><p>As a Dancing Major at the Minzu Capital University, her figure was excellent. She also had a beautiful name. She was called Ayimina.</p><br/><p>The key to their acquaintance had been the gigot. During the train ride, she just hadn\u2019t been able to ignore Mu Lejiang, who was carrying a big gigot and attracting too much attention.</p><br/><p>As a curious girl, she had struck up a conversation with the boy and discovered that they unexpectedly got along quite well with each other.</p><br/><p>Of course, Mu Lejiang had other things in mind, and he\u2019d asked her for her telephone number and address.Then he started contacting her daily to hear her news.</p><br/><p>Ayimina had been annoyed those days. The eldest girl in her dormitory had just just broken up with someone. Her ex-boyfriend though was not a gentleman and he kept harassing her, troubling the girl and annoying her roommates.</p><br/><p>The girls had pooled their wisdom to try and find a solution. That\u2019s when Mu Lejiang had appeared like a knight in shining armor, promising to help them solve the problem.</p><br/><p>Thus, he had organized the party and tricked his eldest brother into attending it, so he could pursue Ayimina.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Mu Lejiang wanted to introduce the eldest girl to Ye Dong. If the two of them hit it off, then the ex-boyfriend will have to step back. What's more, Ye Dong and I will be dating two sisters [1].</p><br/><p>Originally, Ye Dong had been opposed to the plan. After going to Typhoon Shelter though, he began to change his mind. Dancers sure are beautiful!</p><br/><p>Let's forgive the boys their shallowness. They focused only on girls with limited IQ.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere of the party was quite good. Both Mu Lejiang and Ayimina had feelings for each other. With their help, the members of the two dormitories had soon gotten familiar.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei asked Qin Guan secretly, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a girlfriend, would you choose one of those girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt that this was the time to show his loyalty, \u201cOf course not. A boy like me could only choose you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the peaceful atmosphere, they heard a strange voice come from behind them, \u201cAh! So you\u2019re cheating on me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned around and saw a boy standing behind their table, looking furious. He was sneering at the eldest girl, \u201cHow long has it been since we broke up? How desperate are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest girl, Guli, looked like she was about to cry. Ayimina couldn't bear it anymore and stood up, slapping her hand on the table, \u201cStop cursing, Guli is not in a relationship with you anymore!\u201d Then she pulled Ye Dong over and pointed to the boy, \u201cCan\u2019t you see? He is Guli\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy looked crazy as he came up to Ye Dong with red eyes, willing to risk his life. Ye Dong could handle him alone. He looked really weak.</p><br/><p>They fought for no more than two seconds before the boy was pushed to the ground by Ye Dong.</p><br/><p>The girls burst into laughter. The boy\u2019s face was red with anger. He turned around and left without a word.</p><br/><p>Ayimina softly comforted Guli, \u201cYou see? I was right. He\u2019ll leave you alone if you get a new boyfriend. Ye Dong could fight three guys like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's roommates were also happy, \u201cThere is hope for our eldest brother. He can win the beauty over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was joyful again. They were just discussing where to have dinner when the bell beside the door rang.</p><br/><p>They turned around and saw the front hall fill with more than 30 people. Leading them was Guli\u2019s ex-boyfriend, who was talking excitedly with a strong-looking man while he pointed at them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pulled Cong Nianwei closer and instructed her, \u201cGo around the tables and along the aisle by the wall. You\u2019ll find the exit. There\u2019s a back street outside. You return to college.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei considered it for two seconds, \u201cShall we decide on a meeting place instead? If I go home, I\u2019ll only be worried about you. After the matter is settled, I\u2019ll go back to college.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was taken aback. He felt moved. My girlfriend is so considerate. She is both reasonable and cares about me. Then he nodded, \u201cOkay. You go out through the back door and walk along the small hutong. At the end of it, is Weigongcun bar street. Wait for me in the Red Star Bar.\u201d Cong Nianwei took her bag from her chair and asked him, \u201cShall I call the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made a gesture under the table, \u201cThe staff will call the police. You don't need to call. You might get in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei joined the onlookers and retreated to walk along the aisle.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan released a long breath and turned to assess the situation. The group of people had confronted them.</p><br/><p>They all had various weapons in their hands, including an iron tube and a mop, which they had obviously borrowed from somewhere.</p><br/><p>Ye Dong was at a stalemate with Guli's ex-boyfriend. The strong-looking man stopped them from saying anything. He poked Ye Dong's chest with the iron tube, \u201cDude, you are not honest. It\u2019s not right to steal someone else\u2019s girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] In China, from ancient times, husbands of sisters always had a special relationship because of their wives. There was a special title for these kind of relatives, namely, \u201cLianjin\u201d.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

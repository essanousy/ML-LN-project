Party A shall provide Party B with a publicity and promotion platform.</p><br/><p>2. Party B shall voluntarily participate in the commercial performances, events, advertisements, and other activities organized by Party A.</p><br/><p>3, Party B shall provide Party A with all necessary personal information, including personal photos. Personal information has to be provided voluntarily and be true, accurate and reliable. In case of a dispute caused by false information, Party B will bear all responsibility.</p><br/><p>Party A: (Stamp) Party B : (Signature)</p><br/><p>Date:</p><br/><p>It was a simple contract with only 13 terms. Qin Guan went through it quickly, smiling at Sister Xue as he signed his name.</p><br/><p>From that day on, Qin Guan was honorably promoted from an untrained model to a C-level model with a formal agency and an agent.</p><br/><p>Sister Zhang stood up and walked around the desk, encouraging Xue Wanyi, \u201cSince Qin Guan is now our model, he should get acquainted with our staff. He will have to communicate with them in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the Marketing Department today. In the future, they will share resources with you, besides the channels you find yourself. You have to cultivate a good relationship with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Sister Xue followed Professor Li and Sister Zhang out of her office and headed towards the Marketing Department.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by the noisy scene in the offices of the Marketing Department. People were answering phones, making posters and carrying costumes. It looked like a bazaar was taking place there.</p><br/><p>Sister Zhang didn\u2019t seem surprised. \u201cEveryone is always super busy after the last date for competition applications. That's to be expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>She led them to a group of staff who were making calls, where a gentle, middle-aged man sat.</p><br/><p>She introduced the man, \u201cThis is Lan Jin, marketing director of New Silk Road. He is in charge of model promotion and agent services. He is a very powerful leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she pointed to Xue Wanyi and Qin Guan and introduced them as well, \u201cThey are a new subordinated agent and model, a combination with great potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director scanned Qin Guan from head to toe in satisfaction before shouting loudly to his staff, \u201cNi Dalei, come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>A strong man stood up from the phones and ran over at his call. \u201cI\u2019m coming! What's the matter, sir?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Jin pointed at Xue Wanyi, \u201cNew subordinated agent. They\u2019ll be in your group from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ni Dalei looked gloomy. Subordinated agents are so hard to control. They know nothing, but they\u2019re always really picky. They can't share the good resources of the company, and if the model does not qualify for ordinary resources, the customers are left unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>In his opinion, subordinated models were of little value, but unwilling to be cast away. They would share tiny jobs with their own models, but the handling charges weren\u2019t even enough to pay for a meal.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Ni Dalei glanced at Sister Xue and Qin Quan furtively.</p><br/><p>That glance changed his mind completely though.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was bound to attract attention as he stood there. Nothing could cover his charm. It didn\u2019t matter if he was among ordinary people or other shining models.</p><br/><p>Ni Dalei reached for Xue Wanyi\u2019s hand at once and tried to persuade her, \u201cWhat a handsome boy! How can you sign a subordinate contract for him? Where is your professional conscience?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Xue Wanyi's turn to be gloomy now. Everyone who sees Qin Guan blames me!</p><br/><p>She explained the situation again helplessly.</p><br/><p>Ni Dalei felt pity for her. He considered Qin Guan really promising for participating in a work-study program and decided to select the best jobs for him.</p><br/><p>In such a world, good appearances were the key to every door.</p><br/><p>The morning passed without any trouble.</p><br/><p>To celebrate her success, Sister Xue decided to treat Professor Li and Qin Guan. After all, the logo of the New Silk Road company would be printed on her business card from now on.</p><br/><p>She drove everyone to the Agency of the Xinjiang Province in the capital, which was located on Sanlihe Road 7 in the Haidian District.</p><br/><p>The Xinjiang style restaurant was inside the agency. With its delicious food, large portions, and reasonable prices, the restaurant was so popular that customers were always waiting to find a seat.</p><br/><p>However, the dinning area in the noisy hall was mediocre. This was a common feature for most Xinjiang style restaurants.</p><br/><p>It was suitable for collective dinner though, especially for meat-lovers.</p><br/><p>They found a table at the innermost corner and asked the waiter to order.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was a frequent patron at the restaurant. She ordered without any hesitation as Qin Guan observed the restaurant.</p><br/><p>It looked ordinary, just like a college cafeteria. The tables and chairs were in disarray, and the window for staple food was outdoors. Customers could just grab a plate and help themselves.</p><br/><p>The dishes were served quickly. A giant plate of meat packaged in crusty pancakes was already on the table.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tried a crusty pancake. Delicious!</p><br/><p>The crisp pancake was soaked in thick mutton soup and tasted soft and tender in his mouth.</p><br/><p>The Xinjiang rice that followed it was just as wonderful. Qin Guan nearly swallowed his tongue along with the carrots slices and chopped mutton.</p><br/><p>A kebab with rose willow sticks followed. The golden baked meat with oil drops smelled excellent on the slightly parched branches of rose willow.</p><br/><p>The cluster was much larger than the kebabs Qin Guan had sold. (Actually, Qin Guan could be an unscrupulous merchant.)</p><br/><p>The meat was tight. Qin Guan enjoyed himself to the fullest, eating meat in thick slices and drinking wine from a large cup.</p><br/><p>Unsatisfied, Qin Guan finally ordered a plate of fried noodles with tomatoes, celery and cutlets. It tasted sour, but the noodles stimulated his appetite to the fullest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That model is called Qin Guan. One month ago, he submitted his resume to our company.\"</p><br/><p> \"He is an independent model. I remember that he was sincere that day. I\u2019m also sure he had not been hired by CK yet.\"</p><br/><p> \"How sure are you?\"</p><br/><p> Armani's assistant looked alert at the news.</p><br/><p> \"Completely. I swear. He is perfect. I had put his resume aside and filed it in our database.\"</p><br/><p> \"Impossible. We would have discovered him during the selection. The HR Department would never have overlooked such an outstanding model.\"</p><br/><p> \"It's true!\" she protested. \"You could check my records in the system. I personally sent his resume to Jimmy in the HR Department.\"</p><br/><p> \"I remember his resume because of his outstanding figure. Qin Guan, male, 21 years old. Chinese, the first Asian Fashion Man, Citizen... LEE...\"</p><br/><p> \"Really? He chose us first?\"</p><br/><p> Giorgio Armani and his assistant exchanged a glance. Then the assistant said, \"Let\u2019s talk about this later. Email me his resume.\"</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Giorgio Armani was reminded of something. \"Do you remember his basic information?\"</p><br/><p> \"Of course!\"</p><br/><p> She recited a series of numbers, making the old man feel relieved.</p><br/><p> \"That\u2019s pretty good. Even better than Chad. Chad used to be an athlete after all.\"</p><br/><p> \"Make a survey later. Even our brand couldn't bear to suffer that kind of loss.\"</p><br/><p> \"Besides...\" He straightened his back. \"I can do nothing about the comments about us and CK... Maybe this will be our Waterloo. We will be brought down by a brand that started by selling underwear! Get me all the media reports tomorrow!\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes, sir!\"</p><br/><p> Chad was talking with his agent, his eyes fixed on Giorgio Armani. The old man should have come over to praise his performance, thus giving his agent a chance to talk to him about renewing their contract.</p><br/><p> His dream didn't come true though. Giorgio Armani and his staff left hurriedly after the show, leaving the assistants behind to deal with the aftermath.</p><br/><p> Chad shrugged at his agent. He was too proud to ask what had happened.</p><br/><p> Countless brands would be waiting for him after the fashion week. Citizen would be his next client. Their investment had pleased his agent the most, so they had to be impressed by his performance.</p><br/><p> The Citizen representative was Qingmu, who had negotiated with Sister Xue and Qin Guan back in Tokyo. As he sat by the crystal castle, he didn't know what to say.</p><br/><p> The rejection in Tokyo was visible in his eyes. He had seen Qin Guan in the fashion week. He had not been working for some inferior brand. He had been an opening model for CK!</p><br/><p> He was just as good as Chad, the leading model of Armani. Qingmu was regretful. A weak voice in his mind kept reminding him of his mistake.</p><br/><p> He was in no mood to see the rest of the show. Before he could stand up though, the spare seats beside him were suddenly filled.</p><br/><p> He gave the newcomers a flattering smile when he saw them clearly. He couldn't leave now.</p><br/><p> Giorgio Armani and his staff were sitting in the spectator seats.</p><br/><p> The next show was LEE, which was quite different from Armani in terms of operation policies and products. Armani was showing an interest in jeans, the poor man\u2019s clothes. The media had discovered something interesting.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan changed his clothes. Suddenly, he turned from a prince into a farmer. He put on a brown cowboy hat. His black tassels swayed as he walked.</p><br/><p> The atmosphere backstage suddenly changed. The tough cowboys stuffed their hands into their pockets and stomped their boots against the floor.</p><br/><p> American country music started playing. The curtain was lifted up, revealing an immense grassland to the audience.</p><br/><p> People in business wear were watching cowboys in cheap outfits with poker faces. The strange scene attracted a lot of attention.</p><br/><p> \"He is coming...\" Giorgio Armani's assistant warned him.</p><br/><p> Qingmu was quite curious about them.</p><br/><p> What? Who is coming?</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was coming...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

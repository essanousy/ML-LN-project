Those sons of bitches! Are you challenging me? This is my home court!</p><br/><p>You are wrong Qin Guan. Models depend on their ability, not nationality. Look! Those domestic male models are taking advantage of this to seize opportunities. Wake up!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan watched domestic models pour out of a sports brand\u2019s office, which he\u2019d originally planned to audition for. He felt disappointed with the cold-blooded world.</p><br/><p>If you all see me as an imaginary enemy, I\u2019ll show you who I am!</p><br/><p>He showed them his middle finger. Just wait and see, you sons of bitches! Then he rushed to the Cabben studio, which was the most important brand during the closing ceremony.</p><br/><p>Cabben came from Hong Kong, and it was actually the name of a famous designer. As a spokesperson for original domestic brands, the brand insisted on the concept of overturning fashion trends. It was famous for its fine lines and the development of materials in Asia, so its first choice were models from the Pickle Nation.</p><br/><p>No one expected Qin Guan to audition for the last show in advance. Surely, this didn't mean that the shameless guy had given up on his original plan?</p><br/><p>They were only half-right. Suppressed by so many opponents, Qin Guan had decided to set a new path. He knocked on the door of the Cabben studio. Sure enough, the other models were all auditioning for the first group of shows.</p><br/><p>There were very few candidates in the Cabben studio. The designer\u2019s eyes lit up as soon as Qin Guan entered.</p><br/><p>He was even more satisfied with him after reading his resume. Confidently, Qin Guan made a simple self-introduction. By then, the models of the Pickle Nation had followed him into the room.</p><br/><p>Brands always had the same character as their designers. Te-Tiger was bold and generous, and Cabben was weird and delicate. The crowd made the designer angry. He asked his assistant to lead everyone out. He had to rub his eyes before looking at the fake models outside.</p><br/><p>After the designer's screams, Qin Guan finished his solo show leisurely. He passed the audition without any suspense.</p><br/><p>The rest of the models had failed every single audition except for the audition of an indifferent brand.</p><br/><p>Before going to another audition, they saw Qin Guan hugging warmly the designer of LEE, who John had introduced him to.</p><br/><p>There was no hope. The guy had been gifted with both good looks and public relations.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had a nice meeting with many designers and discussed their concepts (thanks to Professor Li\u2019s lessons). The others were taking their interviews one at a time.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan got offers from LEE, B+by, GIOIAPAN, Luomeng, Aimer underwear, VLOV and BRJ.</p><br/><p>He only spent a little over an hour on the interviews, although they might have taken others a week. He finished his work in the fashion salon.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was over the moon. If it were not for his tight schedule, she would have asked Qin Guan to take shows till the last day of his life.</p><br/><p>One show for each day. That was enough for Qin Guan. Sister Xue turned down his suggestion to participate in more shows.</p><br/><p>\"You are a public figure now. There will be media at the Fashion Week. If you perform in an inferior show, you will be sneered at by the reporters.\"</p><br/><p>On their way back, Qin Guans\u2019 ears were filled with her rebuke. Sister Xue came back with fruitful results. She had gotten a pile of business cards from designers, which would be a valuable resource for Qin Guan's development.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wasn\u2019t thinking about the same thing. His and Cong Nianwei\u2019s home and Cong Nianwei's birthday filled his mind.</p><br/><p>He had to buy a TV, an air conditioner, a computer and other things, which would be a large expense. He also had to buy a birthday present for his girlfriend. Without any new income, he would be a pauper.</p><br/><p>He bid Sister Xue farewell hurriedly and drove to QH to pick up Cong Nianwei. They had decided that she would temporarily live at their home for the summer holidays. He had to be hospitable so that she wouldn\u2019t change her mind.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan thought this was the happiest day of his life. He slept in in the morning and found breakfast on the table. Cong Nianwei had prepared it for him before leaving.</p><br/><p>With a warm feeling in his heart, he bought household electric appliances and furniture to fill their small nest. It was really his home now.</p><br/><p>In the evening, they finished their work and watched TV together, sitting with their shoulders touching. That was all. Qin Guan slept in a small bed in the other room. The carpet was too hot for him.</p><br/><p>It was August 6th, several days before the Fashion Week. Qin Guan furtively opened his eyes and realized that Cong Nianwei had sneaked out. He jumped out of bed.</p><br/><p>It was Cong Nianwei's birthday, so he had to order a cake and buy her gifts.</p><br/><p>After making preparations the whole day, Qin Guan finally covered everything with a big cloth in the living room. The key turned in the lock, and Cong Nianwei pushed her way in.</p><br/><p>She looked at Qin Guan speechlessly. He had tied a silly blue bow around his neck. She had gotten used to his stupid behaviour by now.</p><br/><p>She watched his performance calmly. Qin Guan bowed before her politely before pulling off the cloth.</p><br/><p>He revealed a professional designer desk, a complete tool set, a PC, a printer, and a designing software.</p><br/><p>Even a calm girl like Cong Nianwei was excited by the sight. She checked all the presents one by one before turning around and asking Qin Guan in confusion, \"Is this all for me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, it\u2019s for my dearest girlfriend. Don't you see the colorful stickers on the machines?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you giving me so many gifts?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why? It's your birthday! These are your birthday gifts from your boyfriend. The one who loves you best!\"</p><br/><p>\"My birthday is on August 8th.\"</p><br/><p>Surprised, Qin Guan looked at Cong Nianwei, who was trying hard to hold her laughter back.</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! I saw your student ID!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei laughed again. \"That's why you peeped at my ID? Didn't you notice that I covered a corner with my finger? I was born on August 8th!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

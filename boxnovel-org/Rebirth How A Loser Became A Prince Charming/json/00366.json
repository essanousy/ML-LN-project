His outstanding looks were appreciated by designers. Fame followed merit, so he would undoubtedly be the model of the opening show.</p><br/><p> Everyone calmed down, and the Armani models, who were led by Chad, changed into their outfits and got on the stage solemnly.</p><br/><p> The CK chief designer nearly fainted when he saw Armani's fall collection. Coincidently, Armani was also featuring a concept of dark tones and practical styles, which was quite similar to the style of CK. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, their leading model, Chad, was also wearing a military style outfit.</p><br/><p> As a result, the two brands would have to depend on their models\u2019 performance, as well as the response of the fashion circle and the media.</p><br/><p> The chief designer secretly congratulated himself. VOGUE's favorite model? The best model in the US? Who cares? My work is better than Armani\u2019s!</p><br/><p> The curtains were lifted to reveal the crystal castle behind them. </p><br/><p> Everything was transparent. The T stage, the chairs, the ceiling, the wall... It was like a little girl's paradise.</p><br/><p> Every flashlight from the spectator seats was reflected with a colorful light, and every model on the stage was enveloped by a magical halo.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan smiled to himself.</p><br/><p> Chad had no idea about the relationship between him and the new CK model. If he knew, he would have just huffed.</p><br/><p> He was the best example of an American Idol. He had originally been an athlete before he had been discovered by VOGUE. Mr. Armani had gotten infatuated with him at first sight, and he had become the old man\u2019s favorite boy.</p><br/><p> As he walked on the stage, Chad looked proud and strong, filled with an eagerness to win.</p><br/><p> The sad city needed to be cheered up. Armani had had to change its usually gentle, refined style to a tougher one. Chad had been the best choice for that.</p><br/><p> The strong American man stood on the stage with his hands hanging deliberately between his thighs. The hearts of the ladies and young girls in the audience were beating fast.</p><br/><p> If I could spend a night with the hottest man on a fashion magazine, all my dreams would come true.</p><br/><p> Chad returned to the backstage area, leaving the stage reluctantly behind him. The seductive moment had been recorded by the cameras.</p><br/><p> Both the designer and the senior manager were frowning slightly, but they remained silent for the sake of their models.</p><br/><p> What should we do after the Armani show?</p><br/><p> There was no time for them to think. Qin Guan turned around, the light of the crystal getting reflected on his jade-like face.</p><br/><p> The chief designer suddenly smiled. He instantly calmed down.</p><br/><p> Moving along to the melodious blues song, Qin Guan walked on the stage.</p><br/><p> The excited audience was frozen on the spot. Qin Guan walked towards the audience like a haughty god descending from Olympus, or an Ice Queen in her own castle. The black suit he was wearing looked loyal on his body.</p><br/><p> Despite the fact that the concept was similar to Armani\u2019s, Qin Guan had a completely different style.</p><br/><p> The photographers went crazy. The designers looked excited. Fashion insiders covered their mouths and hearts with a dramatic expression on their faces.</p><br/><p> Hardess, the God of Ice and Snow, had returned to his grim throne.</p><br/><p> Silence prevailed in the hall, although the music was still playing.</p><br/><p> The chief designer hugged the senior manager, tears filling his eyes.</p><br/><p> \"Awesome!\"</p><br/><p> \"Wonderful!\"</p><br/><p> The staff backstage couldn't help but pat Qin Guan on the shoulder as they passed by him. The Asian young man had performed a miracle!</p><br/><p> The Armani models had been too busy changing clothes to watch the CK show. In their opinion, the brand was not worthy of their attention.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan disappeared in the changing rooms backstage. Giorgio Armani combed his silver hair with his fingers, looking lost in thought.</p><br/><p> He leaned his head slightly to the left, and his smart assistant bent over to him.</p><br/><p> \"Who is he? Where did CK find him? Why have I never seen him before? I need his resume right now.\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes, sir!\" The assistant left immediately.</p><br/><p> \"Excuse me, but I think I know him,\" the receptionist said courageously.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Oh, no. Three buns, please.\"</p><br/><p> The fat soldier looked up in surprise.</p><br/><p> Wow! Another potbelly. Who is he?</p><br/><p> He was shocked to realize that it was Qin Guan. It was actually him in the flesh!</p><br/><p> Some officials had said that Qin Guan would come to their camp to shoot a film, but no one had actually seen him.</p><br/><p> \"What's the problem? They are right here!\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan pointed to the steaming basket behind him. The fat soldier came back to his senses immediately.</p><br/><p> The guys who distributed food in the dining hall were martial artists, so they could use the same ladle to distribute food in different quantities.</p><br/><p> Whoever they liked would get three pieces of pork. Whoever they disliked would only get a side dish.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan, who was experienced at this, got his buns fast. The three white fat guys filled his lunch box. The porridge on the tray was sticky and crystal clear, and the cold dish seemed nice and tasty. Qin Guan got hungry just by smelling it.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, Duan Yihong showed up again with an evil smile and bent over to look at Qin Guan's lunch box. He immediately noticed the discrimination.</p><br/><p> The buns in Duan's hands were smaller, and his porridge was as thin as water. He frowned as he cast a look at the soldier. Are you kidding me?</p><br/><p> Qin Guan was the only famous actor there, so all the soldiers around were shooting curious looks at him.</p><br/><p> Duan, who was a smart guy, decided to steal from him.</p><br/><p> \"Hey! I like your buns. Let's eat together.\"</p><br/><p> He took a bun out of Qin Guan's box and took a bite. The soft crust parted to reveal the tasty, sweet-smelling meatball. It was the perfect combination of wheat and pork. The sweet porridge and spicy cold dish turned it into a wonderful dinner!</p><br/><p> More and more people gathered around Qin Guan to share his food. This was the best advantage of eating in a dining hall.</p><br/><p> After they had dined and wined to satiety, they had to get back to work. Before they left the Beijing Military Region, the cooking team received a notebook with the signatures of the crew. This was the crew's way to express their gratitude.</p><br/><p> Then, they moved to another battlefield. The last scene would be shot on a field training base.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan's charm was covered up by makeup. This was the perfect look for a field battle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

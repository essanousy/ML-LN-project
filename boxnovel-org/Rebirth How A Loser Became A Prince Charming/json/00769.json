He watched the girl in the black wind coat and boots get into a car with the Morgan Stanley logo. She just turned around and drove away.</p><br/><p>Disappointed, Zheng headed back to his own office. He knew that there was another newsstand behind the building. He was really curious about the newspaper after hearing Huang Jiajia's words.</p><br/><p>What the hell is in that newspaper? Why would it make me lose my confidence?</p><br/><p>When he bought the last copy from another newsstand, he understood what she meant.</p><br/><p>The \"Beijing Life Guide\" cost one yuan and was printed like a magazine. When the readers spread it out, they saw that it was just as big as a newspaper.</p><br/><p>Unlike other ordinary newspapers though, it was printed in color. Actually, it was a magazine that cost as much as a newspaper. Its bright design and low price captivated young people all over the capital.</p><br/><p>Soon, Zheng Chuanming noticed the folded page at the bottom. It was a really large poster of Qin Guan smiling at the readers.</p><br/><p>He was wearing black Armani Haute Couture, and even the wrinkles on his black bowtie were visible on the photo as he smiled, holding the golden award up elegantly.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan possessed every good quality of a Chinese man. The young man looked as gentle as jade.</p><br/><p>As he looked at the newspaper, Zheng smiled as well. This will be a good topic for the meeting. The best sacrifice!</p><br/><p>He was not jealous of the man. He just thought that he would be a good introduction to the messy Chinese film circle.</p><br/><p>There were actually nine SARFT branches, but Zheng belonged to the film administration branch, which was a powerful, comprehensive department in charge of all things related to the film industry.</p><br/><p>The meeting that day was about the current situation of the film industry, as well as the actors' social influence. Qin Guan had originally not been on the list, but Director Chen wanted to include him. He was suddenly interested in the young man's future.</p><br/><p>He rushed to the office two minutes before the meeting began, entering the meeting room with all his paperwork. He was just in time.</p><br/><p>The topic was the harmful social effects of the improper behavior of a star. A few days ago, three schoolgirls had gotten involved with some bad boys. They had just been copying the heroine of a film, so the educational department had suggested that TV stations and websites ban all stupid TV shows.</p><br/><p>As a result, they were having a meeting in order to find the stars that promoted the darkest part of society. SARFT would monitor their every activity.</p><br/><p>When they began to discuss negative news about stars, Director Zheng revealed his secret weapon.</p><br/><p>\"Don't just concentrate on those notorious stars. The audience knows them well. They can only improve their image by speculation. They don't have any real social influence. We have to pay attention to the most popular stars. They all have an obscure attitude towards social responsibility, but the public loves them.\"</p><br/><p>\"If scandals about them leak out, young people will learn from them.\"</p><br/><p>His subordinates exchanged speculative looks. Influential stars? But there are so many of them...</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Director Zheng threw the latest issue of the \"Beijing Life Guide\" onto the long table. The newspaper opened to reveal Qin Guan's poster. Everyone suddenly understood his words.</p><br/><p>The award-winning actor was considered an eccentric guy in the film circle, but he had fans everywhere. A girl lifted her hands up with a tremble.</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean by 'obscure attitude towards social responsibility?'\"</p><br/><p>\"Has he cooperated with a national film studio? Did he ever shoot a mainstream film? Did he accept a job from the government or play in a film about the army or the party? These are all important criteria. Do you get my point?\"</p><br/><p>The girl tried to defend her idol. \"He played a part in 'Ke Ke Xi Li' last year. It's a mainstream film about a Chinese-Tibetan antelope reserve.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He felt that the term would go smoothly with so many good things happening.</p><br/><p>First, he had been praised on the professional course by the tutor, who had been deeply impressed by his performance in class. During a routine quiz, Qin Guan had accidentally given a detailed explanation about the next studying material.</p><br/><p>As a result, the tutor believed that Qin Guan was enthusiastic about the courses. Although accounting was not a profound theoretical science, it could be considered an important subject.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s exciting that my student studies in advance.</p><br/><p>Wang Lei, who sitting beside Qin Guan, was left temporarily speechless. That evil scoundrel! He has more part-time jobs than me and only studies a little in the evenings. He has reviewed English ahead of time and studied the professor\u2019s courses in advance. Does he want to drive others mad? It seems like it\u2019ll be much more difficult for me to get the national scholarship this year.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was very pleased with himself. Following Sister Xue's instructions, he set out to go to the Capital Institute of Fashion Technology in a very good mood.</p><br/><p>In the alley beside the Institute, he found the shabby house on the address he had been given. He pushed open the groaning swing door, and was astonished by the scene inside.</p><br/><p>There was nothing in the big spare space, except the standard T stage right in the middle of it.</p><br/><p>All around the house there were piles of photoshoot equipment. Mirrors were hanging on the walls on both sides of the room, reflecting every detail clearly.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue waved to him, and Qin Guan noticed that there was another person standing beside her. He ran up to Sister Xue.</p><br/><p>She pulled Qin Guan over and pressed his head to take a bow before the other person. \u201cProfessor Li, this is my model. He has great potential. His name is Qin Guan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was forced to bow. He stole a glance when he straightened up again.</p><br/><p>An elderly woman was standing opposite him. Time had already marked her cheeks with wrinkles, but she looked extremely elegant.</p><br/><p>Her grace made people forget about her age and clothes, and focus solely on her. She was like a shining object, attracting people in an obvious way.</p><br/><p>The woman scanned Qin Guan calmly from head to toe. Sister Xue, who was standing beside her, put her cigarette nervously into her pocket, secretly holding it between her fingers before she put it down again.</p><br/><p>The teacher sized up Qin Guan and said in low voice, \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Xue immediately held out her hand for Qin Guan to turn around. \u201cTurn around fast. Professor Li, have a look please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan turned. Professor Li looked at him again and said, \u201cOkay. Tell me more about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Xue signaled for Qin Guan to find a place to sit for a while before she started talking at length with Professor Li.</p><br/><p>Professor Li raised her eyebrow slightly as she was told about Qin Guan\u2019s resume, but she said nothing. Instead, she asked Sister Xue a question, \u201cFirst of all, why did you quit modeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Xue was taken aback. She raised her head and then lowered it again, replying in a low voice, \u201cFamily affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not inquiring any further, Professor Li said, \u201cThat\u2019s your business. I\u2019ll take the boy as a student.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Xue raised her head excitedly, \u201cReally? Thank you so much. Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Li only smiled slightly, \u201cDon't read too much into it. I\u2019m only taking him on for his good looks. It would be a pity to see such good material go to waste without proper training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Xue seemed quite excited by her words and nodded hard. \u201cExactly. Just look at him. Ordinary Asian people can\u2019t measure up to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was unknowingly betrayed by Sister Xue once again. Professor Li waved to Qin Guan, who approached at her signal. \u201cMy place offers training for students every day. Xue Wanyi says that you are not a professional and that you have other courses during the day. You could come on the weekends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded. Professor Li continued, \u201cYou have to study the very fundamental skills. The speed of the courses will depend on your progress. Any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head. I know nothing about this job. It won\u2019t hurt to follow a professional\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>Professor Li didn't say anything about his cleverness. She asked Qin Guan to get on the stage and told him, \u201cLet\u2019s start from the basics. Do you know the basic gestures of modeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about the basic hand moves?\u201d Qin Guan shook his head again. Sister Xue began to sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cBody posture? Pace? Standing posture? Sitting posture?\u201d Qin Guan shook his head repeatedly just like a rattle drum. He felt faint. Sweat dripped down Sister Xue\u2019s face under Professor Li\u2019s sharp gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cShame on you, Xue Wanyi! You care about nothing but making money. Your reputation would be tarnished if others found out. How can such a model work for employers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Xue Wanyi were cowering into a small corner, lowering down their heads like quails while they listened to Professor Li\u2019s scolding. \u201cQin Guan, why you are squatting there? It\u2019s not your fault...\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked up at Professor Li. It\u2019s better for me to squat, it makes me feel safer.</p><br/><p>Professor Li was already tired from her lessons. She let out a long breath and told Qin Guan, \u201cLook and listen to me carefully.\u201d Then she shouted at Sister Xue, \u201cDon't just stand there! Help us with note-taking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Xue nodded like a chicken. She took out a small notebook and took notes obediently.</p><br/><p>Professor Li began Qin Guan's first lesson, \u201cLook, gestures are the most important things for models. The first gesture goes like this. It\u2019s called finger-pressing. Your index finger has to be curved slightly to the front. Your thumb should press at the side of the middle pad of your middle finger. This gesture is flexible in modeling\u2026 Does it hurt? Relax and don\u2019t raise it, or you\u2019ll hurt yourself...\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Li made the gesture. Qin Guan automatically opened the gift of his memory. His muscles adjusted to a standard gesture.</p><br/><p>Professor Li glanced at his hand, \u201cThe second gesture is palm-showing. Your palm has to be open. Straighten your index finger, draw your middle, ring and little fingers close to each other and curve them up. It's one of the most common gestures during a performance.\u201d Professor Li switched to the second gesture and Qin Guan mimicked her.</p><br/><p>Without any word, Professor Li changed gestures again, \u201cThe third one is called orchid finger. With your palm facing up, fold your middle finger and thumb. It looks like an orchid.\u201d Qin Guan mimicked her again without any trouble.</p><br/><p>After Qin Guan had learned the three standard gestures, Professor Li suddenly turned to Sister Xue, \u201cXue Wanyi, you naughty girl! You dare try to cheat your teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pointing to Qin Guan, she asked, \u201cYou mean to tell me that he\u2019s a beginner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Wanye trembled at her tone of voice and looked at Qin Guan doubtfully. Qin Guan got up the courage to reply, \u201cProfessor Li, I only have one advantage. I\u2019m a fast learner. I can learn anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Li laughed at his answer, \u201cI have taught quite a few students, but none of them boasted like you. Okay, you say you can learn anything? We\u2019ll continue. Show me the double-hanging gesture.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Professor Li, please tell me what it is, or at least show me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really learning by sight?\u201d Professor Li made the gesture doubtfully. \u201cCurve your middle finger slightly to the front and press your thumb to the middle pad of the middle finger. Like this.\u201d Qin Guan copied her gesture perfectly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

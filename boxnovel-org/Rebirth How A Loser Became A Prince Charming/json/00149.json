They met the same director who had welcomed them last time. They didn't beat around the bush. \u03a4hey talked about the controversial points of the contract right away.</p><br/><p>\"We know the rules. As a big company, their payment is reasonable for Qin Guan. He isn't a famous model yet. What does DV film mean though? We have to shoot a DV film for the contest sponsored by Two Sung.\"</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s a leading actor in a small film? That sounds great. Is the payment included?\" Are you kidding me? We\u2019re not idiots to do two jobs without getting paid anything!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan read the contract twice before replying, \"I accept.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Are you silly? We don\u2019t have to be afraid of such a big company. I\u2019ll ask for more money for you!\"</p><br/><p>Without further explanation, Qin Guan pointed at the DV director's name and signed his name.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue stopped at once and smiled at the director of A.M. \"Shall we begin today? Where is the studio?\"</p><br/><p>Where\u2019s your moral integrity, sister?</p><br/><p>If you think Qin Guan was an idiot, you\u2019re wrong. He knew nothing about the entertainment circle, but he had a general idea of the famous guys appearing on media, magazines, networks and newspapers in his past life.</p><br/><p>The name \"Zhang Yang\" was on the column of DV directors. He was among the sixth-generation directors in China, who were good at maintaining a balance between art and commerce. This could be considered a God-sent ability. Zhang Yang could feel the pulse of both sides. His films became popular without any trouble, and were not overlooked as underground films.</p><br/><p>He had gained professional praise and a wide audience. Generally speaking, he was a very talented director. Of course, the DV was a trial for him. In Qin Guan's opinion, he was using it as a background for prevailing in feature movies.</p><br/><p>That was why Qin Guan could be lead. It was just for play. There was no mention of the box office, as the show would be suspended. The contract had been settled, so they could start.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was shocked by Two Sung\u2019s investment when he entered the studio. The product that would be featured in the advertisement was a professional PD110 DV. Of course, as a layman, Qin Guan thought it was a household camera. The background was quite fashionable, and Qin Guan's costume was a space suit.</p><br/><p>The idea was that a space traveller had stepped into a mysterious room and opened the DV on the transparent tribute altar, which projected the Earth on the screen inside the room.</p><br/><p>There was a vast starry sky. Clustered by shining stars, the water-blue planet looked dazzling. The handsome invading alien would make the advertisement perfect!</p><br/><p>Of course, post-production would be A.M.\u2019s responsibility. All Qin Guan had to do was act the part. His costume had cost a lot. He would be wearing long silver hair, pale semi-transparent skin, and clear puce eyes. It was the best test for a model\u2019s looks.</p><br/><p>It was nothing for Qin Guan though. After the final brush of silver powder, he hastened into the studio. He wanted to start and finish work early so he could get paid earlier. His new house was in need of overall decorations for the kitchen and washroom.</p><br/><p>\"Actor ready! Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed in. In the lens, the alien invader gasped in admiration before the mysterious DV altar. A surprised expression formed on his fairy-like face. He walked to the altar like a nobleman, his waving cloak shining like silver.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan touched the DV on the altar with a religious gesture. The lens zoomed in, his curious eyes becoming clear as a day.</p><br/><p>After a series of movements, the director reshot close-ups of the altar. When everything was perfect, he let Qin Guan go.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt sweaty all over his body when he took off the costume. Sweat was flowing down, leaving a trail on the silver powder.</p><br/><p>It was the middle of May, and the temperature was getting higher. Qin Guan had suffered in the airtight jumpsuit and the thick cloak.</p><br/><p>He didn't feel refreshed until he changed into his loose T-shirt and put a sweet frozen sucker Sister Xue gave him in his mouth.</p><br/><p>The DV contest would take place in the second half of the year. He had no idea about Zhang Yang's film. I won\u2019t suffer any losses anyway. The profits from the advertisement will be 50,000 yuan!</p><br/><p>Before he could relax for a few days, he received a call from Sister Xue asking him to go to the Wangfujing Church. The church was located near the busy Wangfujing business street.</p><br/><p>Confused, Qin Guan stepped into a small photographic equipment store a few metres across the church.</p><br/><p>Sister Xue hadn\u2019t been clear on the phone, and this seemed like an unlikely place for shooting. Suddenly, the glass door was pushed open and five people squeezed in. The room was too jammed to move.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan fixed his eyes on the newcomers. Wow! It\u2019s my acquaintance, Li Bingbing! The two of them hugged.</p><br/><p>Then Qin Guan turned around. The two leaders of the group were taken aback when they saw Qin Guan clearly. A short-haired man in high spirits said, \"Hi, I\u2019m Zhang Yang. Are you Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>He\u2019s the director! Qin Guan greeted everyone, \"Hello, I\u2019m Qin Guan. I\u2019m employed by Two Sung!\"</p><br/><p>The director touched his recently-cut hair, murmuring, \"Are they kidding? I only needed an ordinary shop assistant, not such a handsome guy.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused himself. What? A shop assistant? Only by then did Zhang Yang realize that it was their first meeting and Qin Guan had no idea what the script was about.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it's quite a simple DV. There\u2019s time for him to read the scrip now.</p><br/><p>Du Haibing, who was standing behind him, took a sample script from his backpack and handed it to Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan finished the script within two minutes. Aha! No wonder there were only a few pages. Even the leading actor had very few lines.</p><br/><p>They were actually the following.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck!\"</p><br/><p>\"How much for one?\"</p><br/><p>\"The yellow one.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you selling roses now?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's for you.\"</p><br/><p>That was all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

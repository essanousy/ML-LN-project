Later, Qin Guan sold the banks to dozens of shops in batches of five or ten.</p><br/><p>His journey ended successfully.</p><br/><p>He sold the memory banks for 246 yuan each.</p><br/><p>His small-scale opportunistic practice was finally rewarded.</p><br/><p>His investment lasted for four days. His original capital had been 7,900, and in the end he got 24,600 yuan, earning a profit of 16,700 yuan. The ratio was 300%. He was still nervous until he got the final sum of money. Suppressing the urge to cry out loud, he left Zhongguancun as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Depositing the cash into his account at the Construction Bank in Zhongguancun, Qin Guan let out a relieved breath.</p><br/><p>To celebrate his successful business, he decided to treat his roommates. He made a call to his dormitory.</p><br/><p>\"Hello? Is that Wang Lei? This is Qin Guan. I\u2019m treating you! I\u2019ll bring a pizza back!\"</p><br/><p>Cheers were heard through the receiver. Qin Guan massaged his shocked ear, hung up and took the bus to the pizza place near his college.</p><br/><p>Domino\u2019s Pizza was a restaurant chain for take-away pizza. Qin Guan and his roommates were frequent customers there.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, he ordered at the cashier, \"Seafood, Super Deluxe, Pepperoni, and Hawaiian, one for each. The large size. 12 inches.\"</p><br/><p>The cashier typed on the keyboard with effort.</p><br/><p>This is a frequent customer. Every time our staff are surprised by his good appearance and his ordering speed.</p><br/><p>\"Also, Spaghetti Seafood Bacon and Spaghetti Bolognaise, one for each, Cheesy Bread and Garlic Bread, one for each, and one portion of Seafood and Pork Combo. That's all. Oh, I almost forgot. Is there a free drink for a 200 yuan order?\"</p><br/><p>The young girl checked the menu and answered, \"Yes, there is. Your order costs 355 yuan. We\u2019ll give you a large bucket of a soft drink for free. Is there anything else I can get you?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shook his head. \"That's all.\"</p><br/><p>The girl placed the order and took his money. \"Here\u2019s your change. Please wait a moment. Is it eat-in or takeaway?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan found a seat not far from her. \"Takeaway.\"</p><br/><p>The cashier was pleased. I\u2019m so close to this handsome boy. What a lucky day!</p><br/><p>Watching the passersby outside the window and listening to the country music playing in the restaurant, Qin Guan enjoyed a leisurely time until his order was ready.</p><br/><p>The cashier handed all the food to Qin Guan and smiled sweetly. \"Looking forward to your next visit.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned to his dormitory and found five starving boys in the room.</p><br/><p>They all rushed at the bag in his hands like vigorous tigers jumping down a hill.</p><br/><p>In a moment, all the boxes were open. There was hot pizza covered in cheese, smooth spaghetti in thick meat sauce, and crisp fried chips and chicken wings.</p><br/><p>In 10 minutes, all the food had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Everyone started complaining, \"This is not enough! There should have been some vegetables too! You better go buy a Sunny Veggie pizza, Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Foodies were always shameless. Suddenly, Qin Guan's phone rang. It was Sister Xue, who told Qin Guan to go to the second shooting for the J shirts and attend a photography exhibition.</p><br/><p>The photographer of the J shirts, who had sent Qin Guan's photos to a competition, had won an award.</p><br/><p>The full title of the competition was Top 10 Awards for National Figure Photography. It was held by the \"Figure Photography\" Magazine every three years since 1993.</p><br/><p>3,000 photos by 145 artists from 29 provinces, cities and municipalities had participated in the competition that year. The J shirts photographer had made the top 10.</p><br/><p>He had been completely over the moon. He knew that he owed all his success to his luck and his outstanding model, so he had invited Qin Guan to the exhibition.</p><br/><p>It was a small-scale exhibition in the photography circle, but the prize winners\u2019 works would be exhibited in a small gallery.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was surprised. He had forgotten all about this. He had only met the photographer once, at the shooting site of the J shirts.</p><br/><p>The photographer\u2019s face was full of joy. The boss of the J shirts was also proud. My model is an official New Silk Road model, and my photographer is a rising star in figure photography. Plus, my products are selling well, aren't they?</p><br/><p>He had experienced a lot of happy events lately. Business was going well and the sale volume was steady.</p><br/><p>When the new summer collection came out, his first physical store would open in a new shopping mall, which he considered a very good start.</p><br/><p>The boss was very satisfied with Qin Guan. When he put on the new short-sleeved shirts of that year though, his satisfaction reached its peak. Sister Xue kept flattering him, so he gave them a bonus.</p><br/><p>The theme of that summer was \"cool and refreshing\". Through the thin, light material of the shirt, Qin Guan's skin could be seen indistinctly. It looked very attractive.</p><br/><p>The photographer put down his camera and thought for a while. Then he asked the boss, \"Is there any water?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, in the corner. Are you thirsty? I\u2019ll ask them to get you some. Little Tian, get a box of mineral water over here!\"</p><br/><p>The assistant carried the box over. The photographer took a bottle, waved for Qin Guan to approach, and turned around to ask the boss, \"Can I get the shirt wet?\"</p><br/><p>The boss nodded. \"Yes, feel free to do whatever you want. Everyone here is at your service.\"</p><br/><p>The photographer pulled Qin Guan over and discussed it with him. \"Let's do something sexy. Can I get your shirt wet?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

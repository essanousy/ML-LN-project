They had had a good collaboration a few years ago, so he was in Xu Zheng's mind constantly.</p><br/><p>After the scene, Qin Guan let out a sigh of relief and rushed over to Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>\"I have some spare time now, Wei. It's really hot today, but I'll show you around the base before you return to Beijing.\"</p><br/><p>The two of them smiled and chatted hand in hand. All the newcomers had settled in and some staff had left after getting off work. Some girls tried to take photos of the set and actors in secret so they could show off to their friends.</p><br/><p>In the process, a girl discovered some striking news.</p><br/><p>The man in white is Qin Guan! What a handsome boy! He is holding hands with his assistant! Could this be an office romance? A perk of the job?</p><br/><p>The girl took some pictures as fast as she could and then left with the others. The first thing she did after returning home was copy the photos into her computer and expand them.</p><br/><p>She was right. Qin Guan and the girl looked like lovers in the pictures. They were holding hands and chatting happily. Plus, he also bent down to touch her cheek once.</p><br/><p>The spontaneous shots showed their intimacy clearly. They must have been lovers for years.</p><br/><p>It's said that Qin Guan's girlfriend is not from the entertainment circle. Why would she appear at the film base then? Did she go there to meet Qin Guan? Or did he maybe get a new girlfriend?</p><br/><p>The girl was confused. Unlike other guys in the circle, Qin Guan had never had an affair. The only relationship he had admitted to was the one with his childhood sweetheart.</p><br/><p>Is that her? She had to seek help from Baidu [1]. \"Who is Qin Guan's girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p>There was an abundance of links, most of them from gossip websites, but there was no official answer.</p><br/><p>\"Photos of Qin Guan's girlfriend.\" Strange photos started appearing on the screen, a fat girl topping the list in ridiculous \"S\" poses. All the photos were accompanied by articles or poems.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan's girlfriend should be a talented woman like me!\"</p><br/><p>\"He is my boyfriend. Come to Tsinghua University!\"</p><br/><p>The girl closed the pages speechlessly and tried to calm down. The truth must be on the Haijiao Forum!</p><br/><p>The girl uploaded the photos on the discussion board of Qin Guan's blog and the Haijiao gossip section with the title \"Qin Guan's mysterious girlfriend makes an appearance. Can anyone confirm that this is her?\"</p><br/><p>Below the striking title were photos and an article.</p><br/><p>\"I captured this moment by accident at the Hengdian Film Base. The man in the costume is Qin Guan. I saw him holding hands with this woman. The two of them looked about the same age. They seemed to be very familiar with each other. They looked so intimate and in love!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is there a reliable source that could answer this question for me? Is she Qin Guan's girlfriend? Is she his childhood sweetheart?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm looking forward to your answer.\"</p><br/><p>The stone she cast roused monstrous waves. Some entertainment news reporters always watched that famous forum for striking news.</p><br/><p>These news were certainly worth their patience. There were even pictures!</p><br/><p>The reporters analysed the photos to rule out the possibility of them being post-production pictures. Thanks to the help of professional software, they concluded that the photos were real.</p><br/><p>This only added oil to the fire. People gathered on the forum and posted hundreds of responses, so the admin had to warn the head of the IT department.</p><br/><p>This was destined to be a sleepless night for the entertainment circle. As users poured into the forum, the staff struggled to keep the website running, afraid that it would collapse under the pressure. The excited fans were itching to test its limits.</p><br/><p>[1] The top search engine in China.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

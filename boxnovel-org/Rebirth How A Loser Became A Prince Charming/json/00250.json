It would sell like crazy.</p><br/><p>The worship of foreigners always resonated with ordinary people.</p><br/><p>Thinking of the military flag incident, Wang sneered.</p><br/><p>\"Rather than admiring Japan or South Korea, we should make them admire China. That would be the real success.\" She clicked on the second photo and suddenly sprayed water on the screen. What's going on?</p><br/><p>It was a photo from South Korea. Two girls in different school uniforms were fighting over a magazine.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they had no idea that a boy had taken advantage of their fight to steal the magazine from them and pay the newsstand owner.</p><br/><p>At the back door, an old man was taking a photo of the scene.</p><br/><p>Wang laughed. The photo would be perfect for propaganda.</p><br/><p>Out of the domestic photos, she selected the one with the most people lining up to purchase the album. That was enough. Qin Guan was really charming!</p><br/><p>Wang's propaganda material was silently placed on the boss\u2019 desk.</p><br/><p>\"She signed on with another actor?\" he asked his secretary doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\"No, she\u2019s just preparing for the future. He is not an actor, he\u2019s actually a model. He has enjoyed certain fame in the entertainment circle though.\"</p><br/><p>The boss picked up a photo and recognized Qin Guan, whom he had failed to recruit.</p><br/><p>He knocked on his desk. \"What's the relationship between him and our company?\"</p><br/><p>\"According to Sister Wang, they\u2019re collaborating. If our actors fail an audition, he will be a substitute. We have a detailed contract on the income share. Sister Wang says it's better than letting other companies benefit from him.\"</p><br/><p>The boss nodded in agreement. \"Show him our power, provide enough opportunities, and he will gradually join our camp. Good idea! All the agents in our company should learn from Wang. This is what a talented agent is like. Others get frustrated, but she explores ways out of a muddle.\"</p><br/><p>The boss signed the list. It would not cost him much anyway. \"In the future, the expenses of this actor can be incorporated into Wang's bills. There\u2019s no formal contract, but they can be considered daily expenditures.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" The secretary retreated from the office with the list.</p><br/><p>It seems like I have to change my evaluation of Wang. Even the boss trusts her!</p><br/><p>Every company had its own mechanism on publicity and propaganda. The machine quickly got to work.</p><br/><p>They used printed media, the internet and TV, silently reaching all entertainment fans.</p><br/><p>\"Top Chinese male model d\u00e9buts in Asia. 10,000 Citizen photo albums are selling like crazy.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, the most cost-effective ambassador of Citizen.\"</p><br/><p>Those were the titles on several national newspapers.</p><br/><p>The editor read the latest Southern Weekly contently. W. Brother was so generous.</p><br/><p>He took the bills out of the envelope and began to count them.</p><br/><p>600 yuan, no more or less. In an era when ordinary white-collar employees earned 2,500 yuan monthly, it was quite a good bonus.</p><br/><p>He knocked on a photo of Qin Guan and whispered with satisfaction, \"Thank you, bro!\"</p><br/><p>The news on the internet were a mess. Chinese people were interested in the foreigners\u2019 worship of Great China, which arose a heartfelt sense of pride in them. At the time, young people wanted to be understood and accepted by the world. Due to the anonymity of communication, many misunderstandings arose among countries.</p><br/><p>Patriotism was a civil feeling that existed not only among middle-aged people, but also among the youth. Most young nationalists gathered on the internet.</p><br/><p>When the news were released, commenting areas suddenly got jammed. Thousands of comments appeared under the news.</p><br/><p>The news about Qin Guan were just in time to provide an outlet for confused young people.</p><br/><p>Forum users discussed and spread the news.</p><br/><p>They began to sneer happily at photos from Japan and South Korea.</p><br/><p>\"Chinese boys have a lingering charm. It\u2019s said that top brands and designers prefer models who refuse to have cosmetic surgery.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, they like natural beauty. Wild flowers are much better than plastic ones.\"</p><br/><p>Those kinds of comments kept emerging, some of them analysing the situation and some just boasting. To everyone's surprise, the Goupu Forum, who used to belittle Qin Guan, remained silent. Everyone on the forum was applauding.</p><br/><p>By then, Qin Guan had become a symbol of national honor. Between seven and eight p.m. in the comprehensive entertainment reports, different local TV stations broadcasted the news in their own way.</p><br/><p>Prompt news was a way to keep up audience ratings. Real photos were also proof of the news\u2019 authenticity.</p><br/><p>Qu Xuemen opened the door of her apartment and threw her high heels at random. Despite its elegant decoration, her room looked like a waste yard.</p><br/><p>Judging by her strict and capable image, no one could have imagined that Qu was lazy in nature.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His outstanding skills were beautiful to watch, but something went wrong during the last step of the plan. His smart hands, which were dressed in black gloves, paused 10 centimeters away from the jewellery.</p><br/><p>He tried his best to extend his arms, but it was in vain. It turned out that his extraordinary skill, clear mind and nimble body could not beat the unscrupulous merchants of Chongqing.</p><br/><p>All his equipment had been stolen, so he'd had to repurchase everything at a wholesale market in Chongqing, the wire around his body included. The merchant had told him that it was a full 10 meters, but it was actually shorter.</p><br/><p>The thrifty merchant had sold him a 9.90-meter rope. Those missing 10 centimeters were the final distance between him and the jewellery.</p><br/><p>What a tragedy!</p><br/><p>\"F*cking scammer!\" Qin Guan still managed to get the jewellery out. Just when he thought that everything would be okay though, one of the local thieves arrived.</p><br/><p>He grabbed Qin Guan's jewellery rudely and took off his mask to reveal his face.</p><br/><p>\"Alas! It's you again! Too bad that the stone is mine!\"</p><br/><p>He waved the jewellery proudly at Qin Guan, who was still hanging in the air.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was furious. Those small-town thieves had insulted him too many times! \"Give it back to me!\" he roared.</p><br/><p>This was not a good idea. A man hanging in the air was weaker compared to one standing on the ground.</p><br/><p>Ning Hao and the other actors, who were all smoking by the camera, smiled and laughed. Qin Guan was a cruel boss. He forced them to work overtime every day and set very high standards for their performances.</p><br/><p>This was their payback. They wanted to see their boss go through this miserable experience. That scene was so funny!</p><br/><p>The thief hit Qin Guan on the forehead and pushed him away. Qin Guan couldn't help but turn around in the air. His enemy also used psychological attacks.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! You are Spiderman!\"</p><br/><p>The man pushed Qin Guan again. Qin Guan formed a perfect circle with his body as he spun in the air. The small camera fixed on the rope filmed the scene from his point of view.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha!\" Huang Bo was the first to burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"I'm fainting! What about you, Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone burst into laughter, except for Qin Guan himself. Before the thief escaped, he triggered the alarm system, leaving Qin Guan to be caught by the security guards.</p><br/><p>The director zoomed in on Qin Guan again as he climbed up the roof. Ning Hao had originally intended to use a body double for that part, but the body double's figure did not resemble Qin Guan's. A part of the audience would be Qin Guan's fans, so they would notice every detail right away. They were experts when it came to research.</p><br/><p>Take \"Emperor Han Wu\" for example. Qin Guan's fans had recorded his screen time, different costumes and lines in each episode. Those were the most popular posts on the forum. Thus, after a discussion with Ning Hao, Qin Guan had decided to film the action scene himself.</p><br/><p>He had practised a lot that day. He had climbed walls while the others had been resting, so now it was finally time for him to show his abilities!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

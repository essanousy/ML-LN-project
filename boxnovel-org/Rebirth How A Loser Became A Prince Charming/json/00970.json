We are good friends, right? We should take the risk together. You are welcome.\"</p><br/><p>They made a plan eagerly without consulting Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>What could Qin Guan say? The two of them had to figure out the bright future of the script. Plus, he was a little impatient. They both saw through him.</p><br/><p>Friendship was more important than profit after all. However, a win-win situation beat everything. Besides, the main lead had to be approved by both of them, as well as the director.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan wanted to choose the actor.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, but splitting the risk evenly is not a good idea. You can take 30%. I want to recommend a guy for the leading role.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem. Who is it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Wang Baoqiang.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wang Baoqiang?\"</p><br/><p>\"The miner in 'Blind Well' and Shagen in 'A World Without Thieves'.\"</p><br/><p>The Wang Brothers remembered him.</p><br/><p>\"His looks fit the part. We can discuss this with the director.\"</p><br/><p>After his role in Director Feng Xiaogang's film, the actor had become popular in the circle. However, he was still defined by his redneck image. After several attempts in shoddy TV shows, Wang Baoqiang had disappeared again.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn't understand his choice. In his opinion, Huang Bo was a clever, hard-working man. He was serious with every tiny role and underwent all kinds of training in his spare time. He also tentatively rejected commercials and variety shows. He was a steady actor!</p><br/><p>It was his personality that affected his fate.</p><br/><p>Wang Baoqiang was a plain boy. Qin Guan made a decision and scheduled an appointment with him.</p><br/><p>The film \"Mei Lanfang\" was based on a real person's story. If it succeeded, it would become a classic, but if it failed, the consequences would be terrible. He had to have a meeting with his team.</p><br/><p>When his schedule was ready, Qin Guan realized that he would have a lot of spare time during the next half of 2007. Thus, he decided to carry out his evil plan and try his best to achieve his next goal. He wanted to have a baby.</p><br/><p>A striking man showed up at the construction site of the Olympic stadium. The young man made Cong Nianwei's work a lot of fun.</p><br/><p>\"Did you know that directors from different departments will inspect our work today?\"</p><br/><p>\"I had no idea. I only pay attention to Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't be nervous. The directors won't even look at us. They will just shake hands with the chief engineer.\"</p><br/><p>\"I prefer my part-time job over their long, tedious speeches.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly. I'm so tired these days. If I don't get a big enough bonus, I won't accept another job like this.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's a rare chance, though. My classmates envy me for this chance. It's a precious experience for a future architect.\"</p><br/><p>The man, who wasn't taking the inspection seriously, took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and lit one up amid the blowing wind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

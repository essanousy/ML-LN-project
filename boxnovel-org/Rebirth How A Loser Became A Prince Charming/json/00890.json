The reporters were not satisfied with being limited to that small area by the strange regulations of the festival.</p><br/><p>The Japanese restricted their ideas with all kinds of laws and procedures, so they had set strict rules on the schedule of the film festival as well.</p><br/><p>The stars had to walk to the middle of the carpet according to the beat and then stop. According to the regulators, they had to smile, turn left, smile, turn right, and then move forward.</p><br/><p>Fictional characters didn't have to follow that rule though. When Ultraman began to take his symbolic crossed-arms pose, no one came to stop him. Japan was more lenient with fictional characters than with real people.</p><br/><p>The foreign reporters made their way over to Qin Guan and pointed their cameras at him.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, look over here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, smile!\"</p><br/><p>Even though they were occupying the fan area, the Japanese fans did not complain.</p><br/><p>The Japanese had been focused on other people's appearance since ancient times. In such a country, Qin Guan was considered a national treasure. The fans were screaming out, ignoring the excited reporters. </p><br/><p>They were waving glow sticks, lamps, dolls\u2026 Anything they could find. The crowd followed Qin Guan to the middle of the carpet. Suddenly, a fat man in black walked around a corner slowly. Although he was confident about his own power, the crowd around him would make any individual feel like an ant.</p><br/><p>He put his arms down carefully to reveal the person hiding behind his strong body.</p><br/><p>\"You!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hai!\"</p><br/><p>\"You protected me well, but I wasn't able to see anything.\"</p><br/><p>It was an angry Japanese girl. Only Yamaguchi Tsutomu would wear a traditional kimono to such an event. </p><br/><p>The strong man didn't argue with her. He just bowed deeply, looking very guilty. \"My bad, Miss. I'll fight over the best viewpoint for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's up to you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hai!\"</p><br/><p>The big man rushed into the crowd like a bomb, forcing open a narrow path. Yamaguchi Tsutomu walked along the path at a moderate pace.</p><br/><p>\"There he is, Miss!\"</p><br/><p>They were just in time. Qin Guan was walking in the direction of the girl.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Qin Guan!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan followed the sound of the voice and turned towards Yamaguchi Tsutomu.</p><br/><p>\"Yamaguchi Tsutomu?\"</p><br/><p>A soft fleck of dust flew over to him. Qin Guan caught it unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\"I will always be your fan, Qin Guan! I really like you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks. I like you too.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved at the girl kindly and walked to the end of the carpet. The girl didn't move with the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"Shall I find you another position up front, Miss? Or would you like to know the number of his room?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, that's it for today. Thank you. Let's go back now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hai!\"</p><br/><p>Rich families made connections through marriage. Everybody's life was on the right track, but reality was the best stimuli. In the real world, even a really powerful man couldn't swim in shallow waters forever.</p><br/><p>Yamaguchi Tsutomu bid her love farewell. From that day on, she would go her own way. If everything went well, the two of them would never meet again.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt guilty for stealing the spotlight from a popular children's character.</p><br/><p>Doraemon was moving after him, waving its round hands at the audience.</p><br/><p>I should move faster. I don't want to stay here with it. </p><br/><p>This had to be the funniest red carpet event Qin Guan had attended. Eventually, he reached the stage at the end of the carpet and said goodbye to the cartoon characters.</p><br/><p>The hostess was an elegant woman with a familiar voice. She didn't ask Qin Guan any awkward questions and she let him go as soon as his time was up.</p><br/><p>When Qin Guan took his seat, Wang reminded him who she was.</p><br/><p>\"The hostess is a cartoon voice-over actress. The organizing committee is really creative!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! That explains why her voice sounded so familiar. Which character has she dubbed?\"</p><br/><p>\"Minamoto Shizuka.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

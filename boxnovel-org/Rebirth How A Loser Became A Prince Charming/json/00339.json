Xu didn't ask about the outcome of the interview. He had a general idea judging by the effect he\u2019d had on the customers and the very few clothes that had been left on the shelves. </p><br/><p> He was confused by the brands Qin Guan chose next though.</p><br/><p> In his opinion, Qin Guan looked splendid in casual clothes, so he should try out for similar brands.</p><br/><p> GAP, AE and AF would have been good choices.</p><br/><p> Why did he want to visit CK and NORTHFACE?</p><br/><p> He couldn\u2019t figure out Qin Guan\u2019s criteria. Maybe models had their own secrets.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan saw Xu Xiaoxiao off and returned to his apartment in a good mood. All his preparations that day had been groundwork for the future.</p><br/><p> He couldn't rely on casual clothing brands. His ultimate goal was to get into the US modeling circle.</p><br/><p> He needed a chance to introduce himself to the brands.</p><br/><p> He was focused on the width and not the depth at the moment. It was enough to get a taste of the most popular brands in America.</p><br/><p> He was taking off his shoes at the entrance, when Cong Nianwei craned her head around to look at him from the kitchen.</p><br/><p> \"Tomorrow is Columbus Day. What shall we do?\"</p><br/><p> Qin Guan realized that the holiday was right after the weekend. Italian-Americans celebrated their holiday on the second Monday of October.</p><br/><p> Americans liked to change other people\u2019s traditions and make them theirs.</p><br/><p> This holiday had originally been in memory of Columbus\u2019 adventure, and it had been celebrated by Italians.</p><br/><p> However, as more and more Americans followed the tradition, the president had declared it an official holiday.</p><br/><p> The next day, Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei attended the festivities on the busiest street of New York.</p><br/><p> That day, there was a festival dedicated to countries from the American Continent.</p><br/><p> The floats in the parades were moving slowly. Girls from Latin countries, such as Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, were dancing in sexy costumes of their national flags. A group of strong men seemed fascinated by their slender legs and the colorful feathers on their heads.</p><br/><p> The poor guys waving Italian flags were ignored by the crowd.</p><br/><p> Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei discovered a unique skill Italians possessed. The 58th Columbus Day didn\u2019t disappoint them.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, dozens of fine horses appeared. Handsome Italian riders in uniforms and silver helmets were on top of them, holding Italian flags. They strode along Fifth Avenue in an imposing manner.</p><br/><p> A group of beautiful girls followed. The flower balls in their hands dazzled everyone.</p><br/><p> \"It's the parade!\" Before Qin Guan's voice could fade away, he nearly choked on his juice.</p><br/><p> A group of clowns rushed out, rolling and crawling. Their ridiculous masks attracted a lot of attention.</p><br/><p> That was why everyone considered Americans the most swanky people in the world.</p><br/><p> The clowns blew ribbons at the children, disturbing the array of Italian beauties, and ran up to the floats to show off.</p><br/><p> They forgot that the horses were not war-horses from the Middle Ages though. They were just ordinary horses from the suburbs.</p><br/><p> Most of them were used for transportation. They were tame with their masters, but they had been raised in the quiet countryside. As a result, they got frightened by the crowd and the strange faces all around them.</p><br/><p> They neighed and jumped, and their riders couldn\u2019t control them. After all, they were not professional riders. They were just handsome actors.</p><br/><p> Noticing that the commotion was getting closer to him and Cong Nianwei, Qin Guan pushed Cong Nianwei behind him and turned to leave as fast as he could.</p><br/><p> He was surprised.</p><br/><p> If this had been in China, everyone would have backed off, putting their own safety first.</p><br/><p> The strong American men were itching to help though. Some short-tempered members of the crowd put their bottles down, climbed over the fences and rushed up to the horses. Qin Guan looked down and saw the pile of beer bottles on the ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

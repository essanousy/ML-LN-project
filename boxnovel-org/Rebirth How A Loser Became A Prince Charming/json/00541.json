The shrimps were small and elastic, with the typical sweetness of North American species. </p><br/><p>She swallowed a mouthful of soup and told her depressed boyfriend, \"You didn\u2019t like the pancakes?\" Qin Guan had nearly torn apart the small pancakes.</p><br/><p>\"No, I\u2019m just feeling down. I\u2019m a star in America, so I don\u2019t understand why there were no news about me in the newspaper.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei took a pancake, put some pickles on it and rolled it up. Then she stuffed it into Qin Guan's mouth.</p><br/><p>\"You had five minutes of screentime. How could they judge your acting? Finish your breakfast quickly. Your big event is in a few days!\"</p><br/><p>\"You are the lead in \u2018Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\u2019. Few indie or artistic films are distributed by Miramax. You\u2019ll be scared by the overwhelming reviews then!\"</p><br/><p>As he chewed, Qin Guan\u2019s attention was diverted from the newspapers. As a Chinese foodie, for him delicious food was the solution to everything.</p><br/><p>The mainstream media didn't pay much attention to Qin Guan's role in \"Heroes\", but Qin Guan's fans liked anything he did. After leaving the cinemas, they would post on Qin Guan's blog right away.</p><br/><p>So did Qin Guan\u2019s haters.</p><br/><p>\"Look at that funny guy with the beard! He is not handsome at all!\"</p><br/><p>\"He is a servant of Jet Li in China!\"</p><br/><p>As his fans got angry about the comments, someone said calmly, \"How did you find this actor and his blog then?\"</p><br/><p>This enlightened everyone. Suddenly, Qin Guan\u2019s fans began to make fun of his haters.</p><br/><p>\"You must be big fans of his! Thank you for your contribution to the box office!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s haters left the blog helplessly.</p><br/><p>Wood was the No. 1 fan of Britney Spears, so despite his extreme hate for Qin Guan, he had bought a ticket for \"Heroes\".</p><br/><p>Now he was looking at his computer screen angrily. Why did I buy a ticket? I\u2019m such an idiot! Did I do it just to get to know my enemy?</p><br/><p>Who knew how many silly guys had bought tickets for the foreign film for the same reason, thus helping it reach the top of the American box office for three days.</p><br/><p>\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", which was an indie film directed by George Clooney and distributed by Miramax, did unexpectedly well at the box office on the day of its release. The minority film made as much profit as \"Heroes\", which shocked all movie critics.</p><br/><p>As the old gentlemen went out of the cinema with their high top hats and walking sticks, along with their old companions, the reporters were enlightened.</p><br/><p>The fans of the novel and the generation that had been influenced by Chuck were yearning for something. This was not a film targeted at young people.</p><br/><p>As a result, the reviews were not as mixed as those of \"Heroes\". The audience didn't pay much attention to the plot, but they were passionate about Qin Guan's performance.</p><br/><p>They felt like they had discovered a gem in the sand.</p><br/><p>\"The plot was boring, to be honest, and the directing was average. The only highlight was the protagonist. That Chinese actor was outstanding.\"</p><br/><p>\"The film is loyal to the original overall. Its black humor is still there. It tried to copy everything, but I have to say that the best thing about it was the lead.\"</p><br/><p>\"I can sense the actor\u2019s potential from his resume. He could become famous all over the world.\"</p><br/><p>The media praised Qin Guan as his fans celebrated on his blog. Meanwhile, he was kneeling on the keyboard at home [1].</p><br/><p>\"Tell me how you felt when you exposed your bottom before the camera. That explains why you didn\u2019t want me to watch the film!\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was sitting in a chair with a smile on her face. Qin Guan remained silent.</p><br/><p>\"Was it necessary for the advancement of the plot?\"</p><br/><p>\"I think you enjoyed it.\"</p><br/><p>\"How did you feel when Julia kissed you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Did Drew Barrymore see your body clearly?\"</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lan Lan</p><br/><p>[1] A common method used by women to punish their men at home.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After pondering it for a while, Qin Guan ticked the names of Lynn Hung (1980), Eileen (1984) and Liu Wen (1988).</p><br/><p>After changing clothes, the selected models were led to a large meeting room. As they waited, they split into two groups based on their gender and began to talk to each other.</p><br/><p>Wherever there were people, there were always cliques. The Chinese judged others by the region they were from, so the girls were divided into three groups: Mainland, Hong Kong &amp; Macao and Taiwan. Each group had its own leader, but there was actually one model who had worked in the mainland for a long time. That was Lin Zhiling.</p><br/><p>The girl, who was good at observing others, was the oldest one among them, so she acted as a kind coordinator.</p><br/><p>Lynn Hung: Those rednecks are trying to pass this selection in vain!</p><br/><p>As a local Dior model, she was certainly qualified to say that.</p><br/><p>Liu Wen did not seem like a cool girl, but she was definitely hot. She was the youngest one among them though, so she dared not challenge Lynn Hung.</p><br/><p>\"This is typical. Why are all mixed-race models so arrogant? They are no better than everyone else.\"</p><br/><p>The other girls smiled at her answer.</p><br/><p>The girls from Hong Kong felt insulted though. They all had ties to different countries, such as France, the UK, Portugal, Spain, and so on. Eileen suddenly made another attack. \"From a biological standpoint, mixed-race individuals are more likely to be attacked by new viruses...\"</p><br/><p>Before Lynn Hung could burst into tears, the door of the meeting room was suddenly pushed open and Wang walked in with a short list.</p><br/><p>\"Lynn Hung, Lin Chi-Ling, Zhang Li... Follow me, please!\"</p><br/><p>The 44 models that were left in the room knew that they had been selected.</p><br/><p>The 22 male models who had been chosen, including Zhao Lei, Zhang Liang, Fu Zhenggang, Zheng Yuguan, Nan Fulong and Ji Huanbo, would become famous during the next few years.</p><br/><p>The assistants led the models to their apartments, which were located in the Chaoyang District. Eight models would have to share one apartment, which was much better than their average living conditions. Some of them were still struggling to make a living after all.</p><br/><p>They would all go through a paid training, but it was the bonus of the Paris Fashion Week that was the final goal of the eager models. They didn't aspire to achieve what Qin Guan had. Lv Yan and Du Juan had failed to do that.</p><br/><p>They were just longing for a chance to participate in the Paris Fashion Week. The international stage seemed to wave at the rising stars as the power of Chinese models gradually increased.</p><br/><p>The eliminated models were all calm and peaceful. Lin had been offered a contract of one million, so she left without any regrets.</p><br/><p>Lynn Hung though, who was the best model in Hong Kong, didn't understand why she had been weeded out. Kathy Chow and Patina had been selected after all. When she tried to get in touch with Qin Guan through her agent, she received a small note in response.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's sincere but indifferent words helped her come to terms with reality. She felt colder after reading the note.</p><br/><p>\"Hong Kongers rule in Hong Kong because they understand the city better than everyone else. That's why they can make good use of the city's resources.\"</p><br/><p>\"Similarly, before entering a country or a region, a top brand has to take the local customers into consideration. When it comes to different cultures and cities, a renowned local star or model will usually be the key to their market.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are certainly loved by Hong Kongers, but you do not qualify for an international runway show.\"</p><br/><p>\"Considering your five years of experience, you must be aware that there is a gap between you and international top models. I wonder if you have received a foreign offer other than an invitation to watch the show.\"</p><br/><p>The note shattered the girl's dreams as the reality of the situation wounded her pride.</p><br/><p>She tore the note into pieces slowly. Instead of throwing them away though, she stuffed them into her purse and left silently. The assistant didn't say anything. Hong Kongers were none of his concern right now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

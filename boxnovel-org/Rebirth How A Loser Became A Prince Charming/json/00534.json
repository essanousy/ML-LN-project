This was her last chance to kiss Qin Guan. He looked really handsome that day...</p><br/><p>As the cameraman zoomed in on Qin Guan\u2019s face, she put her arms on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>There was a slow, soft song playing. Lindsay was watching his face shyly, exuding tenderness and love through her eyes. \"Are you feeling sick?\" Qin Guan asked his partner affectionately.</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>\"Did you drink?\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled at her. His eyes looked like a new moon. Qu swallowed her saliva, feeling jealous of the perks that actresses enjoyed.</p><br/><p>Before everybody came back to their senses, Qin Guan kissed Lindsay on the lips.</p><br/><p>The director eyed the cameraman. Three cameras were pointed at the dancers, light pouring onto their bodies. The camera on the ceiling was rising slowly.</p><br/><p>The lovers were kissing each other as if there was no one else present. The camera was rising higher and higher, until it reached the ceiling.</p><br/><p>It had been five minutes. What was the director doing? When would this scene end?</p><br/><p>Lindsay was thanking God silently. Becoming an actress had been the wisest decision of her life. She was really enjoying it.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>The camera had reached the top. The sound woke up the director.</p><br/><p>\"Cut!\"</p><br/><p>Thus ended Qin Guan's part in the film. What he needed was to rest in a quiet corner. After five minutes of kissing, he was experiencing an oxygen deficit.</p><br/><p>Qu was talking with the director as all the actresses gathered around Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, can I have your MSN?\"</p><br/><p>\"Me, too!\"</p><br/><p>The girls, who were the same age as Qin Guan, had forgotten about their small conflicts during filming and decided to take advantage of these last moments to be with him. The good-tempered actor had impressed them with his looks and kindness.</p><br/><p>A girl tried to confess her love to him, but he answered her with a few words. His rare morals were precious.</p><br/><p>It was thanks to the director that they had met such an outstanding gentleman. The girls had now higher boyfriend standards.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qin Guan left the set, the company published the news online. The insiders of the film circle were happy to see the news published on a fresh platform.</p><br/><p>It was a blog run by some geeks.</p><br/><p>Due to the timeliness of the updates and the convenience of the news dissemination, many users in the United States tried to use blogs to share their first-hand news about the stars.</p><br/><p>Film companies and fashion insiders started official blogs.</p><br/><p>Professional blogs were flourishing like mushrooms after the rain, but Metefilter became a pop culture phenomenon.</p><br/><p>Metefilter was a blog where stars and fans discussed film plotlines, TV series actors and performances, as well as other related topics.</p><br/><p>The users had heated live discussions, and countless companies, agents and stars also visited the site.</p><br/><p>Although there were always special teams working on official blogs, some lucky fans would see their favorite star on their blogs.</p><br/><p>The website was also famous for its heated discussions and rude words.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was reading a script in the car as he headed to the Mike Nichols\u2019 Company. An old friend and colleague of his had recommended him to the director as soon as he had said yes to a new film.</p><br/><p>He had been lucky enough to audition for the investor, producer and director of the company.</p><br/><p>He owed Julia Roberts big time.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qu was still thinking about Vivian\u2019s call. \"Do you think it\u2019s necessary to start your own blog on Metefilter? I\u2019ve heard that fans there are not friendly.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who was still absorbed in the script, smiled. \"I\u2019m not worried about that. I\u2019m more worried about my blog not drawing enough attention. That would influence my status. Film companies all over the country would know.\"</p><br/><p>Qu sneered at him. \"Don't worry, you\u2019ll have more than enough fans. If you are not afraid, you can ask Vivian to set it up for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's settled then!\"</p><br/><p>At the temporary office of the Nichols Company in Los Angeles, the curious old man finally met Qin Guan, the actor who had been strongly recommended by Julia Roberts.</p><br/><p>His eyes were sparkling behind his glasses. Unlike other directors, he was not shocked by Qin Guan's looks.</p><br/><p>As Qu introduced Qin Guan, Nichols sprang up from his chair and took Qin Guan's arm.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

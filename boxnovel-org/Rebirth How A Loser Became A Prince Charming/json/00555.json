As a result, it had the lowest audience ratings. It was aiming at a distinct target group of young women between the ages of 16 and 34, so it would be easy for it to become a popular TV station if it made the right choices.</p><br/><p>The new TV series airing on it were a disaster though. The audience ratings suffered because of the network\u2019s weak promotion. TV stations relied on viewers attracted by stellar programs. A TV station needed a loyal audience in order to attract advertisements.</p><br/><p>This was the basic relationship between sponsors and good programs. While that network was stuck in the mud, CW was promoting \"America's Next Top Model\", a fresh-from-the-oven program.</p><br/><p>CW had smartly chosen to broadcast it during summer vacation, when teenagers were still at home, and hire some controversial personas as judges. Before the first broadcast, CW promoted the program for two weeks. Now it was finally showtime.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan\u2019s loyal fans were already sitting on their couches. They had been informed by his official blog that a new TV program would air on CW featuring Qin Guan as a judge. This was a chance for them to find out about the latest activities of their idol. They could never let such a chance go.</p><br/><p>Of course, most of the audience had been attracted by the constant advertisements. They were wondering if the program would surprise them pleasantly.</p><br/><p>The show began.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, I\u2019m Stella from Indiana. I\u2019m 175 centimeters tall...\" An average-looking girl was talking before the camera.</p><br/><p>The girl on the couch grimaced and shouted to her mother, \"Mom, come and see! How dare such a girl submit a tape to the competition! I\u2019m prettier than her!\"</p><br/><p>Her mother walked over slowly with a plate of cookies and some juice.</p><br/><p>\"Let me see, honey...\"</p><br/><p>\"There she is, mom! This is a competition for top models. Any confident girl above the age of 16 can participate, regardless of race, height or weight...\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, honey\u2026 This is a new program. Maybe it's some kind of parody. Look at those contestants. If they could be selected, then you could win this competition!\"</p><br/><p>She sat down next to her daughter and criticized the program with her as they ate cookies and drunk juice.</p><br/><p>Women always compared themselves with others unrealistically, even if they were 100 years old and toothless.</p><br/><p>The forum on Qin Guan\u2019s official blog was bustling.</p><br/><p>\"As a girl from Oklahoma, I think she looks ridiculous!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is Oklahoma an American state?\"</p><br/><p>There were acerbic comments everywhere. People even made fun of the accessories the contestants were wearing.</p><br/><p>The contestants were concerned about the program the most. Although many of them had already been in the modelling circle, they participated in hopes of getting more popular.</p><br/><p>As a result, they were angry about those comments.</p><br/><p>Soon, Tyra Banks, Jay Alexander and Qin Guan showed up, making the girls scream in glee.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! It\u2019s Tyra Banks! One of the top female models in the world!\"</p><br/><p>\"And Jay Alexander! Founder of the best model-training school! Am I dreaming?\"</p><br/><p>\"You must be dreaming! Look who they invited! It\u2019s Qin Guan, the famous top model!\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder how he gets along with the three ladies...\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the audience changed its mind about the show. CW must have invested a lot to get so many big shots of the fashion circle on the show.</p><br/><p>Everyone began to concentrate on the ordinary girls, getting absorbed in the process. Qin Guan walked on the stage calmly. The mother and daughter sitting before the TV forgot to swallow their cookies.</p><br/><p>The 13 girls looked like ugly ducklings compared to his brilliant looks. When Qin Guan finished his performance, they all came back to their senses.</p><br/><p>\"It was cruel to have him on the show. The comparison with the girls was abysmal.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

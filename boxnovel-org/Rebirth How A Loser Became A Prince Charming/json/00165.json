Qin Guan\u2019s companions looked at each other in confusion.</p><br/><p>\"I don't want to say any more. You can go, Qin Guan.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and Sister Xue left conscientiously. Considering that there hadn\u2019t been any real injury, that was the best they could expect.</p><br/><p>They had acknowledged the existence of a criminal and left it up to Cabben to catch him. It was time to call it a day.</p><br/><p>They drove quietly on the way back. Without a detective on site, that was the best result they could have hoped for. At least they would be more vigilant in the future.</p><br/><p>The model from the Pickle Nation would be on Cabben\u2019s black list from that day on, which was no trifling matter.</p><br/><p>People had to pay for their stupid behavior, but clever men escaped unscathed.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan returned home and put on his favorite colorful shorts. He took out a beer out of the fridge and drank it. Cong Nianwei was asleep in the bedroom. In the living room, the TV was broadcasting boring TV shows on mute. Qin Guan had been busy the whole summer, so he\u2019d missed the European Cup.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, I didn\u2019t miss her. All his anger and pressure dissipated at the sight of Cong Nianwei\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>On the desk, several blueprints were rustling in the breeze. After a hard day, Qin Guan fell asleep on the couch.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was woken up by his heavy breathing. She went to the living room and covered him gently with a blanket.</p><br/><p>\"Sweet dreams!\"</p><br/><p>It was a dreamless night.</p><br/><p>As the saying went, no pain, no gain. As juniors, Qin Guan and Wang Lei finally had some kind of routine. They wouldn't be cheated by Ye Dong though. Ye had become Vice Chairman and an honorable CCP member during the new semester.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan couldn\u2019t help but annoy his classmates by getting the top college scholarship, but his roommates didn\u2019t care about that. Without any family education courses, Qin Guan felt relaxed. He could finally calm down and find a good job in his spare time.</p><br/><p>While he was explaining his splendid future plans to Wang Lei with his new textbooks in hand, a girl called him from behind, \"Senior Qin!\"</p><br/><p>It was Mou Xiaoliu. Qin Guan turned around and saw Huang Jiajia next to her. After enrolling at college, Huang Jiajia had found herself again, and her mother had come to appreciate the spoiled fashionista that she was.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan gestured at Huang Jiajia to stop her from rushing up to him. He asked Mou instead, \"Why are you two together?\"</p><br/><p>\"She has enrolled at our college.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? That\u2019s impossible with her score!\"</p><br/><p>\"Many ways lead to Rome. I could have a specialty or a sponsor. Who cares?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved at Wang Lei, who was watching the scene happily. He handed his books to him and said, \"It\u2019s nothing. She\u2019s just my student. Go! I\u2019ll explain later.\"</p><br/><p>Then he turned to Huang Jiajia. Before he could say anything, Hang Jiajia beat him to it. \"I\u2019m your schoolmate now, I\u2019m no longer your student. I like you and I\u2019ll chase you!\"</p><br/><p>Mou was stunned. Why had Huang Jiajia confessed so suddenly? Wang Lei stumbled on a stone not far away and ran away in a hurry. (He had definitely been eavesdropping.)</p><br/><p>Annoyed, Qin Guan told Mou, \"I want have a private word with her.\" Mou left as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan led the smiling Huang Jiajia to a pavilion nearby.</p><br/><p>\"Huang Jiajia, I have a girlfriend.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know, I\u2019ve met her. So what? No one can predict the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"Listen to me. Frankly, we are just teacher and student. Nothing else. You might be in the same college as me now, but you will always be like a little sister to me, no matter how many years pass.\"</p><br/><p>\"But...\"</p><br/><p>\"Huang Jiajia, I don\u2019t like ambiguous emotions. You had never made a clear confession like this, so I couldn't say anything.\" (Actually, it\u2019s a little cruel to treat a girl like this.)</p><br/><p>\"But... I really like you.\" Tears filled Huang Jiajia\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\"I appreciate your feelings, but I\u2019m only a tough guy with good looks. It would be irresponsible of me if I reciprocated your love. I\u2019m not good at nice words or delicate rejections. I\u2019m sorry.\"</p><br/><p>\"What if you broke up with your girlfriend?\" Huang Jiajia was unwilling to give up.</p><br/><p>Closing his eyes, Qin Guan tried to imagine Cong Nianwei leaving him. He felt pain in his heart.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, he opened eyes again. \"No, never! I love her. If she wants to leave me though, I\u2019ll give her my most sincere blessing.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia burst into tears. Her budding blossom of love, which had been waiting to burst open, withered. She cried her broken heart out. Tears poured from her eyes, ruining her makeup, but Qin Guan didn't think she looked ridiculous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

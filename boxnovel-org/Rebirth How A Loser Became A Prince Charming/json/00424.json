What do you do for a living? You have the perfect figure. I could make standard models by putting you in a plastic mold.\"</p><br/><p>Thanks so much for the appraisal. I\u2019d die in the mold.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan put on the white linen shorts and explained to him, \"Strictly speaking, I\u2019m a part-time model.\"</p><br/><p>Then he turned around. When he saw Qin Guan's face, the strong man immediately covered his face with both hands. \"F*ck! Let me calm down for a second. I\u2019m not gay! I like girls with big boobs. Okay, let's get to work. Fred will make sure even your own mother won\u2019t recognize you.\"</p><br/><p>He took out a box of diluted latex and brushed some on Qin Guan's chest and belly.</p><br/><p>When the latex was thick enough, Fred pasted four pieces of artificial skin on Qin Guan's ribs and abdomen. Then his assistant began to apply bad-quality powder and liquid foundation over them.</p><br/><p>In five minutes, the snow-white latex had turned the same color as human skin. It looked like Qin Guan\u2019s real skin.</p><br/><p>Fred estimated the effect and took a small bucket from the table. Inside it was blood, the best tool for the dressers of a dracula movie. Some careful dressers would blend paints of different colors, while some tougher guys would just apply tomato juice.</p><br/><p>The man-made blood was poured over Qin Guan's belly. After a while, Qin Guan had a general idea about his make-up.</p><br/><p>The reason he was lying on the table was because he had been disemboweled. The texture of the latex expressed that terrible visual.</p><br/><p>The assistant took a mini disposable injector filled with a suspicious-looking liquid. \"Open your mouth,\" he told Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked at the liquid in alert. \"What's this?\"</p><br/><p>Fred laughed. \"I thought you were experienced, young man. Don't worry, it\u2019s a mixture of syrup and edible paint. It\u2019s not eel blood or anything.\"</p><br/><p>Some smaller studios used eel blood for convenience.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan relaxed. The assistant injected the artificial blood into the gaps between his teeth.</p><br/><p>It was the perfect bloody make-up. Sour, sweet and tasty!</p><br/><p>Qin Guan tasted the blood carefully. It's good. I want more!</p><br/><p>Before he could say anything, the director shouted outside of the room, \"Are you ready for the next scene?\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay! Roll him out!\" Fred shouted back.</p><br/><p>Dude, can I have some more juice to go?</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could voice his shameless requirement, he was rolled out by an assistant.</p><br/><p>There were some simple mechanical machines in the center of the set. Qin Guan's bed was rolled over to them.</p><br/><p>It was dark. There was only a surgical lamp hanging down from the ceiling. It felt like the Sun, projecting heat and light down on Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>The latex was burning with the heat. Qin Guan paid no attention to the hot pieces though. He was absorbed in the entrails hanging by threads above his head. The end of a hanging gut was touching his stomach.</p><br/><p>This role was an unprecedented tragedy. He was disembowelled and living thanks to all kinds of machines. What a miserable life!</p><br/><p>American people are f*cking crazy! I like them!</p><br/><p>Sister Xue couldn't stand still from the shock. My baby, you have been a leading actor in two films! If this was China, you wouldn\u2019t have accepted such a role!</p><br/><p>That was why indie film actors were not very popular in the US. Their films were nowhere to be seen and all their effort went to waste.</p><br/><p>Before Sister Xue could come back to her senses, everyone was ready. A D-level actress was standing by the operation table. She was one of the heroines of the seven stories of the film.</p><br/><p>Marsha had straight brown hair. She had discovered the abandoned warehouse by chance during summer vacation. It looked like Hell itself. Blood and guts were everywhere.</p><br/><p>Besides, there was still a living person inside. At his request, Marsha liberated him from death, but she got in danger later.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was the guy liberated by Marsha, an extra with only one line.</p><br/><p>\"Three, two, camera!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Guan entered perfect acting mode.</p><br/><p>Marsha mustered all her courage to move slowly into the warehouse. Blood was everywhere. The main source of blood was in the center of the room. It was an operation table.</p><br/><p>Artificial blood was pumped into curling guts to form a steam. There were blood drops dripping from the gaps.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my God...\"</p><br/><p>On the cold operation table, she saw a stranger. The man\u2019s pupils were already slack and his face was shining with joy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Among that group of people, only Lin Zhiying was a professional racing driver. Besides, it was a mountain road with certain angles and turns.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan, who cherished his life, made the right choice.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he was too careless to notice Hu Jun and Xiu Qing\u2019s expressions. They were grinning widely without any sympathy.</p><br/><p>The car roared away, leaving dust and smoke behind it. The roads of Zhejiang Province were quite smooth. There were bright street lamps all along them, helping drivers see even in the dark.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sat at the passenger seat. As they drove on, the road gradually became steep and narrow. Not long after, they went through three curves.</p><br/><p>The only advantage was that there were no other cars on the road. They just relaxed and drove at full speed.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, here it is! Get some rest first. The official race will start later.\" Lin Zhiying reached the clearing on the mountainside first.</p><br/><p>The other cars followed him and parked behind him. They all opened their windows. \"The loser treats everyone as usual, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused. I\u2019m not racing anyway. I\u2019ll know about the stakes later.</p><br/><p>Lin Zhiying was excited. \"If I win, you\u2019ll win. We\u2019ll ask Hu Jun to treat us to dinner,\" he told Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>Huh? Okay. I don't know what you\u2019re talking about, but it seems like there is some kind of benefit in it for me.</p><br/><p>\"Seatbelts fastened?\"</p><br/><p>\"On your mark!\"</p><br/><p>An assistant waved a small flag at Lin Zhiying. He was holding a round professional timer in his hand. It seemed like they held such competitions often.</p><br/><p>The flag was dropped and Li\u2019s nerves were eased. Qin Guan was influenced by his emotions. Everybody cherishes their life. They\u2019re just competing for fun.</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could come to his senses, Lin stomped fiercely on the accelerator.</p><br/><p>The car moved forward at air-breaking speed. Qin Guan could clearly hear the sound. His seatbelt was useless. Inertia threw his upper body forward.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! What the f*ck\u2026 Oh!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan seized the handle above the window, which he hadn\u2019t paid attention to earlier. It might be the only thing that could save his life now.</p><br/><p>In front of them was a smooth downward slope. It was horrifying in the dark night, but fortunately, Lin chose the inner side. Otherwise, Qin Guan would have cried out in fear.</p><br/><p>They met at the first turn. Qin Guan held on to the handle tightly while Lin smiled pleasantly.</p><br/><p>They dashed down as fast as the wind. The gentle man was finally showing his savage side.</p><br/><p>Slow down! Slow down! Slow down! That was the only sentence echoing in Qin Guan's mind. People balancing between life and death couldn't think about much.</p><br/><p>Not his parents, family or girlfriend, nobody came to mind. His brain was blank, as if there was a chasm before his eyes.</p><br/><p>The car was getting close to the cliff. The driver rotated the steering wheel in excitement and stomped on the brakes again and again.</p><br/><p>Are you stomping on rats, bro? One stomp is enough!</p><br/><p>The road was gradually getting flatter. Lin parked at their destination. He looked at Qin Guan, who was much younger than him, with an admiring expression.</p><br/><p>It was his first time racing on a mountain road. No tears or snot in sight. He is worthy of my respect. He is as calm now as he was when the race started.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? We\u2019re here! Shall I get out and meet Hu Jun and the others?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan?\"</p><br/><p>Lin pushed Qin Guan gently, bringing him back to his senses. Did you say something, bro?</p><br/><p>Actually, the guy\u2019s spirit had freed itself from his body. It was too slow to keep up with the car.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, we\u2019re here! Brother Lin, you are the one I admire most among the crew!\" Really? Qin Guan used to call him Senior Lin.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re flattering me! Let's get out now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, okay.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waited until Lin got out of the car. Then he took a deep breath and loosened his grip on the handle, murmuring to his legs, \"Please try for me.\"</p><br/><p>They were both limp.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan managed to get out and lean against the car. Then he observed the road.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Hu Jun and the others were driving at a normal speed. They were not professional racers after all.</p><br/><p>Hu Jun was surprised to see Qin Guan standing by the car.</p><br/><p>\"Wow, he is really brave! I shouldn\u2019t have judged him by his looks.\"</p><br/><p>Xiu Qing gasped in admiration. \"Such a brave guy! I remember you spitting out when you got out of Lin\u2019s car.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha! Shame on me!\" They both burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\"Another round?\" They looked at their watches. \"No, tomorrow we\u2019re flying to Dali. It\u2019s already late at night. We have to go back.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem.\" They headed back to their cars. Lin Zhiying noticed that Qin Guan was still leaning against the front side of the car.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, get in!\"</p><br/><p>\"I can\u2019t move, brother.\"</p><br/><p>What a funny boy! Lin helped Qin Guan through the door and reassured him, \"Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t speed on the way back.\"</p><br/><p>[1] A Japanese cartoon about downhill racing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

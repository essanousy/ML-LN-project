The salary standard is in accordance with the salary of first-level TV actors per episode.\"</p><br/><p>\"Count the episodes carefully then. It's important.\"</p><br/><p>You are really serious about small change. Aren't we putting the cart before the horse?</p><br/><p>After she arranged an audition with the director, Qin Guan handed Wang another script.</p><br/><p>\"Look at this too. It seems like the director and the producer have made a decision, but it's interesting. The whole cast and crew is a secret, so don't post any news on our website. As soon as the Golden Horse Awards are over, I'll fly to America directly from Taiwan.\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem, Brother Qin. Shall we go to the Beijing Film Studio now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><br/><p>They headed to the studio in Qin Guan's new car. His Cherokee had been scrapped, so Qin Guan had chosen the latest Benz E280, which had a high-end look and cost a reasonable price. He didn't like the Audi A6 Sister Xue had chosen for him. That was not the right car for a young man. </p><br/><p>The gatekeeper of the studio let his car in without any questions. In Director Yin Li's office, Yin Li and Director Hu Mei were standing by the window, looking at the long legs that had gotten out of the car.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan is coming.\"</p><br/><p>\"You can recognize him just by his legs?\"</p><br/><p>Women were always careful with such strange questions. Yin Li choked.</p><br/><p>\"You just cooperated with him. What did you think of the young man?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is pretty good. The two actresses were both inferior to him in terms of acting talent. Don't just use my word as a reference though. He has never acted in a historical TV show after all.\"</p><br/><p>Director Hu nodded before she returned to her own office. Not long after, Qin Guan knocked on her door.</p><br/><p>\"Come in, please.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed the door open and entered, leaving Wang outside. As expected, the interior design and decoration of the office were the same as in Yin Li's office.</p><br/><p>Before he could introduce himself, Hu Mei spoke without beating about the bush.</p><br/><p>\"I heard that you wanted the role of Tian Fen? Just act a little for me.\"</p><br/><p>She was curious to see which scene he would choose. Qin Guan leaned on the couch and stretched his hand out furtively towards his sister's jewellery case. His elder sister was a palace concubine, so every time he had the chance to enter the palace, he would steal something from her.</p><br/><p>His sneaky expression made Hu angry. She was itching to throw something at him.</p><br/><p>\"Cut! Cut!\"</p><br/><p>As soon as she spoke, Qin Guan retracted his hand as if he had been interrupted by a maid and looked at Hu guiltily. She had actually become a part of the scene.</p><br/><p>Hu burst into laughter. \"Why are you so eager to get the role?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is interesting. He is a real person instead of just a simple historical symbol.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. Your sincerity won me over. You can join the crew. Don't forget that it's a big role.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much, director!\"</p><br/><p>His gratitude was more sincere than the one he felt for Yin Li. He really loved the role.</p><br/><p>After so many years since \"The Legend Of The Swordsman\", Qin Guan flew to Zhejiang again. His destination this time was the Hengdian film base in Jinhua, one of the two best film bases in China. The other one was in Zhuozhou in the Hebei Province.</p><br/><p>It had taken the prop team one year to build the Qin Palace. The most important scene of the entire show would focus on the details on the tombs of the Han Dynasty.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan and his assistants joined the crew. Before he could even unpack his luggage, the older actors arrived.</p><br/><p>\"Are you new here, Xiao Qin?\"</p><br/><p>\"Come here!\"</p><br/><p>They were all as old as Qin Guan's father. He handed his luggage to his assistant and walked over to them.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, I'm Qin Guan. Nice to meet you.\"</p><br/><p>\"We finally have a young man here. Make yourself at home. Bring a watermelon from the well for us.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

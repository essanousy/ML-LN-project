IMG is the largest model agency with the biggest number of top models, while ELITE has the longest history.\"</p><br/><p>\"I never got in touch with them. I didn\u2019t even get an invitation from them.\"</p><br/><p>\"According to my source, you accepted a card from a top talent agent from one of them and never responded.\"</p><br/><p>\"Plus, Xue Wanyi turned down an invitation from the other company after arriving in the US. She prefers that I arrange your schedule.\"</p><br/><p>\"Considering that you have signed contracts with VOGUE, NYLON, BAZAR and other famous fashion magazines and accepted representative offers from nearly 10 top brands, they feel threatened. They think their profits will suffer.\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! My contracts are not worth that much. How much loss will I cause them?\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\" Qu Xuemei broke in, swaying on her black high heels. \"The market for male models is different from the female model market.\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s common for top female models to get tens of representative contracts worth 100 million dollars. Compared to the giant market of products and brands for women though, the market for male models is limited.\"</p><br/><p>\"There are few subordinate brands for the top brands. If there is a male model with a high quality and comparatively low salary, he will occupy half of the high-end market.\"</p><br/><p>\"To summarize, the money tree is in someone else\u2019s yard, and that tree blocks the way of other poor male models. If you were them, what would you do?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan shivered as he answered, \"Poison that guy?\"</p><br/><p> You must read too many novels on Qidian.</p><br/><p>Qu shook her head at his low IQ. \"No! Prevent him from getting offers.\"</p><br/><p>\"They will show your shortcomings to the top brands to verify that you are not worth your salary. Your ability is not enough for them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Those proud brands would never allow someone with big flaws or ordinary abilities to be their representative.\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s why I think that someone is after you. Enemies are interfering with your work without you noticing.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan frowned at her words. His work was an important source of income for him that had nothing to do with his own dream. They had gone too far though. Preventing him from making money was as bad as killing his own parents.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan asked a last question. \"I\u2019m clear about the situation, but when and where?\"</p><br/><p>Qu stared at him for a full 10 minutes before she realized that he was serious.</p><br/><p>\"L\u2019Oreal,\" she said with a sigh.</p><br/><p> \"With that top model?\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha... Is that their trap? They are underestimating me!\"</p><br/><p>Qu grimaced. They have really underestimated you, you genius.</p><br/><p>Qu smiled as she thought about the new contract with L\u2019Oreal.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you still here? Go have lunch!\" Before Qin Guan could come back to his senses, she left the site on her high heels.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn\u2019t take the news seriously. He began thinking about Cong Nianwei instead. How is she doing now?</p><br/><p>IMG and ELITE would have been enraged if they knew what he was thinking about.</p><br/><p> ...</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was doing well, but the atmosphere was not good.</p><br/><p>The competitors had originally worked harmoniously. Most of them worked in studios in New York, or were team members of some university. There were always some special people in every industry though.</p><br/><p>Lan Jin was a member of a rich second generation of business talents. He Ming had been born into an elite family with a general idea of the policies and the international situation. Unlike them though, there was a group of black sheep that was very good at throwing gold into the river.</p><br/><p>They were talented in the eyes of their families.</p><br/><p>One of them was sitting next to Cong Nianwei. He was the boss of the Caiwang Design Company and had graduated from the famous New York State University.</p><br/><p>He was male and he really liked women. He had the same name with his company. His surname was pretty good. It was Qian.</p><br/><p>Those company and group executives couldn\u2019t take any money from the companies easily. They seemed rich, but they had to get pocket money from their mothers.</p><br/><p>Qian Caiwang was different. He was even richer than Lan Jin. His father owned a family enterprise, several mineral caves, and half of a business street.</p><br/><p>He was the only member of his family to get a degree. He had finished his studies and opened a design company with some schoolmates one year ago. This was his first trial at a formal business.</p><br/><p>Actually, he had planned on going shopping with his new girlfriend from South Korea to show off his power as a boss.</p><br/><p>Anyway, I\u2019m a wonder boy.</p><br/><p>He had encountered the goddess of his dreams in that serious workplace though.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

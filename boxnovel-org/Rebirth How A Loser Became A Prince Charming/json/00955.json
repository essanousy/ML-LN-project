She should have been preparing for her new album.\"</p><br/><p>\"Actually, she went to Egypt to shoot for her new album. She was kidnapped there, but she escaped.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! That's legendary! I have a question, though. Every time we travel abroad, a big group of people follows us. She went there to shoot for MTV, not to explore the pyramids.\"</p><br/><p>\"People say that her tour guide...\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait a second!\" Cong Nianwei was not there, so Qin Guan's IQ would have to do. He hung up and made another call. In his opinion, this had to be fake news.</p><br/><p>He called He Ming, who was his informant.</p><br/><p>He Ming had been born into a family of diplomats, so he had good connections in that circle and was a good source for international news and secrets between nations.</p><br/><p>He Ming accepted the task and called his friend, who was working at the Egyptian Embassy.</p><br/><p>He Ming was right. The officials stationed in foreign countries always kept an eye on any news related to their countries, for fear that their national image would be affected by something.</p><br/><p>Thus, the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Egypt had attached great importance to Sun's case as soon as the Taiwanese media had made it public. In an effort to restore the truth and guarantee the safety of tourists, the embassy had sent two officers to get all the details.</p><br/><p>His friend was happy to tell him everything.</p><br/><p>\"So, that's what happened. Why are you so interested in this matter? I thought you never paid attention to entertainment circle gossip. Do you like that girl?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, rubbish! Qin Guan asked me for information.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan? The famous Qin Guan? Brother He! You have to introduce him to me! I'm a fan of his!\"</p><br/><p>\"No problem!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much! Tell Brother Qin about this as soon as possible. See you!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was scared by this brave attempt.</p><br/><p>\"What? The news were fabricated?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Sun had signed a contract about some specific scenic spots for her music video. The guide was sent by the tourism administration, which was afraid that the crew would cause unnecessary damage to the antiques.\"</p><br/><p>\"Nowadays, Chinese people do not take trips to Europe anymore. They go to Egypt instead, because of its abundant history and culture. These kind of news always trouble domestic travelling agencies.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sun went to Egypt through an official channel, so the Chinese embassy and Egyptian officials found the so-called criminal. He was only a tour guide. He was guiding another group, when our people found him.\"</p><br/><p>This must have been very dramatic. The kind guide had just been guiding a group, and people had fabricated lies about him...</p><br/><p>\"So, this was nothing but fabricated news?\" Qin Guan was speechless. He was shocked by the brave attempt of the Taiwanese.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Don't give up!\"</p><br/><p>The situation was under control immediately. The soldiers turned around to express their appreciation.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks! Be careful!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's expression shifted from appreciation to horror.</p><br/><p>\"Look out!\"</p><br/><p>The voice was still clear in his ears, when he heard faint creams come from afar.</p><br/><p>\"Boss Qin! Be careful!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Watch out!\" Time seemed to freeze as darkness clouded Qin Guan's eyes. The sky and earth started spinning around as years seemed to go by in a short period of time. When Qin Guan woke up again, everything around him was white.</p><br/><p>Am I in a hospital? This is a lot of equipment for a disaster area.</p><br/><p>It was really quiet, but the light above him was on. Qin Guan felt terrible.</p><br/><p>Where am I? Did I lose my consciousness and get transferred out of Sichuan? Where is my assistant? Where is my wife? Is anybody here?</p><br/><p>Someone was coming. It was Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>Is this April Fool's? Are you kidding me?</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei, who was wearing a nurse's uniform, stared at Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>\"Alas! You woke up at last. I have to inform aunt as soon as possible.\"</p><br/><p>Aunt? Before Qin Guan could say anything, Cong Nianwei turned around and left. When she returned, Qin Guan's mother was with her. She had tears in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! You woke up! What a miracle! My son...\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, aunt. He will recover soon.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you calling her aunt? You should be calling her mom.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei flushed and left again.</p><br/><p>What the hell is going on?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan realized that something was wrong. Cong Nianwei looked a little older than he had expected. The calm girl seemed really shy, yet she was still lovely.</p><br/><p>His mother seemed pleased.</p><br/><p>\"Son, you are finally back. You are over 30 years old. I know you've liked Wei for a long time, but no ordinary girl would want to marry you... You are always away on business trips and you drink too much wine. You were rejected in 99% of your blind dates... You seemed to get lucky during that last date, but then you had an accident on that construction site...\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan swallowed his saliva as he tried his best to select the right words.</p><br/><p>\"Was that last date with Cong Nianwei?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. You were so happy when you came home. You kept singing for a full three days. You even shaved your beard!\"</p><br/><p>Beard? Qin Guan was shocked.</p><br/><p>\"Is there a mirror in the room? What's the date today?\"</p><br/><p>His mother handed him a small mirror.</p><br/><p>\"You have been sleeping in this bed for a week. You must be confused.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan took the mirror and saw the familiar big fellow in it. The guy in the mirror was plain, strong and short. A thick beard covered half of his face. It was the very beard he'd had in his previous life. An ordinary man would have lost his mind, yet Qin Guan only asked one question.</p><br/><p>\"Did Wei take care of me while I was sleeping?\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow! You call her Wei? When did you two get so close? You didn't have any time after that first blind date.\"</p><br/><p>\"Maybe we dated in my dreams. I want to marry her!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's mother patted her thighs. \"Alright. Then propose to her. I'll call the matchmaker and express my appreciation.\"</p><br/><p>The two of them had forgotten to close the door. By that time, Cong Nianwei had notified Qin Guan's doctor, so a group of people had heard their dialogue. Cong Nianwei's colleagues fixed their eyes on her.</p><br/><p>Does this mean that she's getting married? That gentle girl is really unlucky. She has been single for too long.</p><br/><p>They all turned to the patient on the bed.</p><br/><p>He seems like an honest, simple guy. As long as his head is alright, then we are all happy for Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was looking at Cong Nianwei eagerly. Cong Nianwei buried her face in her hands.</p><br/><p>\"You idiot! She didn't say no! That's basically a yes!\" His mother poked his head with a finger.</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" Qin Guan got up excitedly, got out of bed and walked over to Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>\"We can talk about it later, when you get off work.\" He took her hands.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! Put on some pants!\" Qin Guan looked down and realized that he was naked. He hastened to cover himself with the sheet.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei flushed again as she nodded faintly. Qin Guan grinned wider and wider, until he started laughing happily.</p><br/><p>I don't care that I returned to my previous life. I don't care that I'm a loser again. You are my whole world, no matter where we are!</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Doctor! Come and see! Why is our boss laughing like this?\" The exhausted doctor was pulled close by Qin Guan's team. She shot a fierce look at them.</p><br/><p>\"He's having a really good dream. He is about to laugh himself awake!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

To whom could he express his grievance? Chi was going to cry.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei couldn't bear to be around someone with such a low IQ. Covering her forehead helplessly, she waved to Qin Guan. \"I have a headache. Don't talk to him, your IQ will get lower. Take me back to my dormitory.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang burst into laughter. This is free entertainment! How could Chi even survive this far in life?</p><br/><p>Since the heroine had left, everyone walked away, smiling to themselves. The funny incident was spreading as fast as a tide. It was already considered one of the most ridiculous events of the year.</p><br/><p>As Chi\u2019s best friend, Zhao Tianyi helped him back to their dormitory and tried to comfort him. The two lonely boys could be seen under the dim light of the lamps. Friendship lasted forever. A true friend supporting one unconditionally was a life fortune. Forget about love, Chi Hailin. Go down the road of friendship instead!</p><br/><p>Liu Xiayang couldn't stop laughing on the way back. He narrated the story vividly to other people as he returned to his dormitory. Thus, a new legend about Qin Guan started spreading around campus. It was said that his girlfriend was as pretty as a fairy, and all the boys at QH had committed suicide for her. Like a god from Heaven, Qin Guan had rescued the stray lambs with his charm.</p><br/><p>What juicy gossip!</p><br/><p>The incident remained in Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei's memory as a brief interlude. After many years, there would only be sweetness left.</p><br/><p>What was Qin Guan doing then? He was working on the freshman welcoming party, helping Ye Dong organize it. After the tedious military training, the freshmen had returned to college. They were fixing up the hall for the party, as those guys were too disoriented by the prank calls junior girls were playing on them.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn\u2019t stay for long, as he had to go to Huang Jiajia's home. When he arrived and saw the smile on her mother's face, he knew Huang Jiajia had gotten a good mark on the general examination. On the school report, which Huang Jiajia cherished like treasure, Qin Guan saw a series of A\u2019s. The few B\u2019s couldn't influence the final result. Qin Guan praised Huang Jiajia and promised to take her to Carrefour the next day.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia was really excited that they would go on a date together. Early the next morning, she turned over her chest of clothes, looking for something to wear.</p><br/><p>\"Too simple!\" She threw a piece of clothing away.</p><br/><p>\"That skirt is too short!\" You have turned your back to evil and returned to the good side, Miss Huang. Did you forget your bare midriff and the miniskirts you used to wear?</p><br/><p>\"Not good!\"</p><br/><p>\"Not good enough!\"</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia weeded out most of her clothes. When one needed to dress up, they always wished they had more clothes than they did. Finally, Huang Jiajia decided on the outfit she would wear that day.</p><br/><p>She looked pretty in her white sweater, skinny jeans and white child-like shoes. Before leaving, she took two bills from her mother\u2019s wallet and a yellow backpack decorated with rivets. It was the perfect outfit for a date!</p><br/><p>......</p><br/><p>The Carrefour supermarket was near the capital zoo. A famous garment wholesale market was located diagonally across the busy road. The location was perfect. She was early for her date, so Huang Jiajia enjoyed the lively scene outside Carrefour.</p><br/><p>A new discount mall had opened that day. Balloons and colorful ribbons could be seen everywhere, and promotion girls were standing by the entrance. The most interesting thing were the two large bears played by real people, who were giving out leaflets to passersby. The two bears had short arms and legs and were charmingly naive. Huang Jiajia was deeply absorbed in them.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she heard a noise. A motorcycle passed through the street, the driver grabbing the bag of a lady. The motorcycle went through the crowd and passed by the entrance of Carrefour. In a moment, it would reach the road and nobody would be able to catch the thief anymore.</p><br/><p>The thief smiled happily, and the lady stopped chasing him, accepting her misfortune. Everything had happened in a moment, so the onlookers had had no time to react. The thief pressed on the accelerator proudly. Huh? Why am I still this far from the road? He turned his head around, realizing that his motor was being pulled by a hairy bear paw. One of the bears giving out leaflets by the road was holding on to the running motor with one paw.</p><br/><p>The back wheel was lifted from the ground, emitting thick smoke. The motorbike couldn't move. It was as motionless as a statue.</p><br/><p>\"Wonderful!\" The onlookers applauded.</p><br/><p>Huang Jiajia was really excited. So powerful! So brilliant! It was the kind of scene one saw in an action movie, not in real life.</p><br/><p>The guy in the bear costume waved at the onlookers, acknowledging their applause. Dear onlookers, please be serious. He is no acrobat! The thief was ferocious. He got off the motorcycle and pulled at the bear with force. It was difficult for its thick hairy paw to hold on. The bear loosened its grip. Taking advantage of it, the thief lifted up his motorbike, ready to escape.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

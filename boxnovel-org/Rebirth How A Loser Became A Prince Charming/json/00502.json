Leave this to me!\"</p><br/><p>Vivian and Liu Tianxia spread the flag and banner, which had the phrases \"Qin Guan\u2019s Fan Club Arrives at Harvard\" and \"Fans of Qin Guan, what are you waiting for?\" printed on them. On the back were large photos of Qin Guan. In two minutes, they had attracted all the students\u2019 attention.</p><br/><p>\"Is that a sports champion?\"</p><br/><p>\"Impossible. Maybe it\u2019s about some party? Oh no, they are fans of some star!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is a star coming here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why would a star come here?\"</p><br/><p>The professors turned around to locate the source of the noise.</p><br/><p>\"Isn\u2019t he handsome?\"</p><br/><p>The Harvard professor didn't say anything. He just turned around, murmuring, \"I\u2019m gonna crush you with my IQ...\" Before they could reach the building, the square was filled with fans.</p><br/><p>Some young men playing football on the lawn saw the flags from afar.</p><br/><p>\"What's that? The guy on the banner looks familiar.\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s Qin Guan\u2026 Those are his fans\u2026 He\u2019s from Columbia...\"</p><br/><p> \"F*ck! I know him. Do you remember the mischief during the game with Columbia?\"</p><br/><p>\"The \"Harvard sucks\" sign?\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! The guy on the photo is one of the culprits. I\u2019d remember him even if he was burned into ashes!\"</p><br/><p>His friends felt the same bitter hatred for their enemy. \"What shall I do? Should I beat him?\"</p><br/><p>The leader watched the group of Columbia students and the fans gathering under the banner, shaking his head.</p><br/><p>\"We should beat him with our strategy, not by force. Harvard students are no bullies.\"</p><br/><p>\"It seems that they are here for the academic exchange. When we get to the canteen, we can...\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The atmosphere during the academic discussion was hot. Qin Guan, who acted like the college mascot, nearly fell asleep during the meeting. Shocked by his looks, Harvard had sent a team of boys to the meeting, so that Qin Guan wouldn\u2019t distract everyone. The two groups were equal, which made the Columbia professor quite resentful.</p><br/><p>After the meeting, they went to the public canteen. Half of it was occupied by Qin Guan's fans. When they entered the room, they were welcomed by loud cheers.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, welcome to Harvard! We love you!\"</p><br/><p>The excited girls, led by Vivian, greeted their idol. They were holding food, flowers and gifts in their hands.</p><br/><p>The college mascot, who had nearly fallen asleep and drooled during the meeting, attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Once again, looks were exceeding one\u2019s IQ. The straight-A students had teared up.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me!\" Some strong men squeezed through the crowd. \"Are you Qin Guan? Welcome to Harvard. We are your loyal fans.\"</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the canteen. In a few seconds, people started whispering to each other.</p><br/><p>\"Why is the sports club here?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea! They must be training for the competition.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was confused. When did so many strong guys become my fans? He looked at them, finally understanding. His perfect memory helped him recognize the guys who had chased after him after the game.</p><br/><p>They are here for me! What should I do?</p><br/><p>Qin Guan's brain was functioning at high speed. Maybe going on the offense will be better. There\u2019s a key for each lock after all.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smoothed down his hair and smiled, which Sister Xue strictly forbade him. </p><br/><p>His eyes were clear and sincere. His face was pure and warm. He looked like the bright moon.</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked when he took the hands of the sports club leader.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much for being my loyal fan.\"</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was the only one who had understood that her boyfriend was in trouble.</p><br/><p>The leader flushed. \"Why\u2026 Why are you holding my hands?\"</p><br/><p>As the girls around them screamed, Qin Guan said, \"I\u2019m paying back the favor. Shaking hands is a natural form of expression.\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! I support you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan! Shake hands with me!\"</p><br/><p>The crazy girls cast fierce looks at the strong men. How dare you compete with us! This is disgusting!</p><br/><p>The sports club leader had lost, but there were still some guys that were immune to Qin Guan\u2019s charm. A cunning-looking guy stepped forward.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

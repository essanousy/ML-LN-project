Thank god I\u2019ve kept a distance from you, Xu Xiaoxiao. You lower the IQ of the whole class.\"</p><br/><p>Kuhn took his paper away. Looking up at the ceiling, he walked out of the room. When he reached the entrance, he turned around and said, \"My name is at the top of the grade list. You guys should be ashamed.\"</p><br/><p>Xu was speechless. What do you mean? Look at the list more carefully before you speak.</p><br/><p>Prof. Martin swallowed awkwardly. He had no chance to warn Kuhn, who was already reading the list outside.</p><br/><p>At the top of the list was... Qin Guan.</p><br/><p>A line of A+! Kuhn looked at the lonely \"+\" on his own paper, as well as his name under Qin Guan's, in astonishment. Tears started running down his face.</p><br/><p>Leaving a few scraps of paper behind him, he disappeared at the end of the corridor.</p><br/><p>\"What happened to him?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea.\"</p><br/><p>As they walked on the campus path, Qin Guan and Xu Xiaoxiao finally felt relieved. Now they could enjoy the beautiful day.</p><br/><p>The latest newspapers were on a stall by the corner. As a well-informed guy, Xu had to get one.</p><br/><p>As he had expected, the front-page headlines were about the prince of the welcoming party.</p><br/><p>The full-page photo was of a really good quality. The reporter was the best student of the Media Studies Department. The article was professional in both wording and composition.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan didn\u2019t take the article seriously, but Xu, who knew the power of gossip very well, was anticipating more drama.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was waiting for Cong Nianwei by the stairs next to the library, still in denial.</p><br/><p>In Western countries, blondes were always more attractive than brunettes.</p><br/><p> A group of blondes that looked like gorgeous celebrities were sending invitations to the handsome, mysterious boy.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, I have an extra ticket to a midnight film...\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m Jenny. Will you have a cup of tea with me?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan made a face and pointed to Cong Nianwei on the newspaper. \"Sorry, but she is my goddess...\"</p><br/><p>American girls were very straightforward. They left without getting angry, but not before reminding him, \"Call us if you break up. We\u2019re always free.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan waved a handful of cards proudly at Xu Xiaoxiao.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Guan, what are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>Safety first. Qin Guan pushed all the cards at Xu fast. \"Nothing important. Xu asked me for some paper.\"</p><br/><p>The two of them went downstairs hand in hand, leaving their silly friend behind.</p><br/><p>A lot of people greeted them along the way. \"Hey! Qin Guan! You look wonderful! Well done, bro!\"</p><br/><p>The two young foreigners were remembered by all tutors and students at Columbia. This was the beginning of their fame.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Sister Xue received an email from Qin Guan, reporting his success. The newspaper article and CK's splendid show made her extremely happy.</p><br/><p>She sorted the material and sent it to his fan club and to Qu Xuemei at VOGUE.</p><br/><p>The phone was ringing nonstop. The busier she were, the better. \"Hello, Director Zhang Jizhong? I know that. The TV shows will air in early 2003? That\u2019s such a coincidence. Director Zhang Yimou will send his work to Hollywood during that period. Of course, it matters. Qin Guan had a role in the film.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that\u2019s right. You\u2019ll have to help us with the promotion...\"</p><br/><p>The crew of \"Hero\" was still working at night. Zhang Weiping got an email from Sister Xue and showed it happily to Zhang Yimou.</p><br/><p>\"Who shall we take to the US? Have you made a decision? Maybe we could just give him a free ride?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yimou looked at Qin Guan, who was smiling under the flashlights at Columbia. He pressed the end of his cigarette into the ashtray. \"You are the boss. You decide.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay. We\u2019ll take him next year.\"</p><br/><p>\"Next year.\"</p><br/><p>Everybody in China was happy about Qin Guan, who had finally found direction in the small room he had been given at the Chelsea Fair, inspired by his girlfriend, Cong Nianwei.</p><br/><p>This had to be named the new gathering place of designers. China would lift its mysterious veil there.</p><br/><p>Cong Nianwei was measuring the room. Time and again, she would turn to Qin Guan to exchange ideas with him.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan was talking with Teacher Rong on his cell phone. They were discussing the products of the store. He was planning on creating a palace of custom-made artwork.</p><br/><p>Because of the limited space, the products would all be from China, but because of the specialty of the district, they also had to be high-end.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

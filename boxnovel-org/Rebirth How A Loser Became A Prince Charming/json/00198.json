She passed them to Qin Guan after he took a seat on the couch.</p><br/><p>They were all in foreign languages. VOGUE was in English, and ELLE and COSMOPOLITAN were in French.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan looked up at Yin, waiting for an explanation.</p><br/><p>Yin Yan massaged her eyebrows. \"You know why ELLE chose me as the Chief Editor of its Asian version. I\u2019m French-Chinese after all, and I have a systematic knowledge of the fashion industry. I graduated from a Fashion Editor School in France.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Asian version is separate from the original magazine, and I\u2019m the director. The headquarters have acknowledged my work of taking China as the foothold of conquering Asia though.\"</p><br/><p>\"In the past two years, ELLE Asia has brought in 40% of the total income, creating more investing opportunities for ELLE in China.\"</p><br/><p>\"On the other side, our competitors have realized there\u2019s money to be made and they want to share it with us. VOGUE is a fashion magazine in the US, and COSMOPOLITAN is ELLE\u2019s main rival in France. They are all among the top five fashion magazines in the world.\"</p><br/><p>\"Here is some good news for you, Qin Guan. VOGUE is about to enter the domestic market, followed by COSMOPOLITAN. VOGUE has reached an agreement with our headquarters. We\u2019ll work together to drive COSMOPOLITAN out of the market. It's funny! They did this only because we were rivals.\"</p><br/><p>\"I am strongly against this agreement. I don\u2019t think we should cooperate with our rivals. The headquarters thought it would be okay to lend you to VOGUE for several issues though.\"</p><br/><p>\"So congratulations, Qin Guan! You have another contract with a top fashion magazine. Even if it\u2019s only the Asian version. Believe me, those American guys are much more shrewd than the French. \"</p><br/><p>Feeling awkward, Qin Guan said, \"Sister, we are friends. Please stop beating around the bush. You\u2019re worried about me, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll take me away with a higher salary.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes,\" Yin Yan replied. \"That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking what your plan is.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan leaned back against the couch, smiling happily. The flowers on the tea table seemed dull compared to his smile.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Yin, I\u2019m not a green hand anymore. I won't say no to a job for anybody. That\u2019s the reality of the modelling circle. With enough popularity, a model can appear in all five top magazines at the same time, not just two. I suggest you change your future plans. Stop competing with Rayli. The Japanese are short-sighted. A model cannot help everyone prevail in this situation.\"</p><br/><p>\"When the domestic fashion magazines come out, there will be fierce competition. All flowers will bloom at once, and you will be having a really hard time. Don't worry though, I\u2019ll never say no to you.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan raised his eyebrows at Yin, casting a soft glance at her. Yin threw a small box fastened with a ribbon at his head and waved him away. \"Go! Go! So much for this business! I don't want to hear your advice! This is a gift from f*cking VOGUE! Take it and go to hell!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan caught the box, blinking at her. He retreated from the office quickly before she threw the scissors as well.</p><br/><p>He opened the gift on his way to the parking lot. It must be an interesting guy who asks an opponent to hand over a gift. Yin Yan thinks she is facing a formidable enemy. Qin Guan was curious about the man.</p><br/><p>When he got to the parking lot, he saw that there was a BOSS tie clip in the box. BOSS was considered the most rigorous fashion brand in Germany. He was so shocked by the gift that he posed like a pheasant, standing on one foot and shouting, \"YES!\"</p><br/><p>A little girl standing nearby pulled at her mother's sleeve and pointed at Qin Guan. \"Mum, is that big boy silly? Why is he posing like that?\"</p><br/><p>Her mother locked the car and turned around, only to see Qin Guan standing still in the parking lot. He was standing on one foot, his other foot curled up. His arms were both raised up above his head.</p><br/><p>He looked like a thief sneaking around in the most exaggerated, cartoonish manner. Putting on a black mask would have worked better.</p><br/><p>Holding her daughter's hand, the mother stared at Qin Guan's strange pose silently.</p><br/><p>\"I don't know, darling. We\u2019d better not disturb him though. He might be a performance artist. I\u2019ve heard that there are many artists like that in foreign countries.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? So he just poses in an empty space? He could be pushed down among a crowd. He is so handsome!\"</p><br/><p>They both expressed their admiration of the artist. The capital is the center of the fashion industry. That\u2019s why we get to watch such an elegant performance!</p><br/><p>They stared at Qin Guan and talked for a short while. Unable to bear the pain on his waist any longer, Qin Guan put his arms down.</p><br/><p>The woman and the girl walked up to him with shining eyes. A small hand was stretched out towards him with a 10-yuan bill in it.</p><br/><p>\"Here you go, big brother. There\u2019s nobody left here. Have a rest while you wait for an audience!\" The girl gave him the tip and waved at him happily. Then she left with her mother.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

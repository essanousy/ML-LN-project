And what about the sponsors?\"</p><br/><p>\"Last season's sponsor was Leica. Any company with a young target group can sponsor the show.\"</p><br/><p>\"My brand is not right for it then. Is there a sponsor for this season?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's said that Metersbonwe is interested.\"</p><br/><p>\"Metersbonwe is similar in style to J Clothing. Call the boss and ask for his opinion. Tell him that I may be involved in the show. I don't need his money. Our brand just needs new materials for the summer. Ask him if he can produce them for us.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Liying was writing swiftly. It was her job after all.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, I almost forgot. Contact the agency of the contestants to see if there is any valuable information. I'd like to sign a contract with some young men. Huayi would be better, I think. It would be the right fit for a greenhand.\"</p><br/><p>Wang was a serious agent, so she tried to warn him. \"Would it be proper to seize talented individuals this openly? Dragon Television is located in Shanghai, at the headquarters of Tiancheng Entertainment Co.\"</p><br/><p>\"We do not get along,\" Qin Guan broke in. \"Competition is the only way to success in the entertainment circle.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had the confidence of a rich man.</p><br/><p>\"Anything else?\"</p><br/><p>\"One last thing.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Xue handed Qin Guan the last document.</p><br/><p>\"It's from Chen Kang.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, it's a personal affair.\"</p><br/><p>The three ladies opened the large fridge, took out its contents and had their afternoon tea in a sunny corner.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan walked to his desk with the papers and read his latest real estate statement.</p><br/><p>The development of Chinese real estate and the Chinese economy had reached a certain stage at which countless problems were caused by the incomplete regulations. As a cunning man, Chen Kang made use of some loopholes to make profit for his employer.</p><br/><p>This was not a report of his success though, but of the influence of the latest regulations.</p><br/><p>For example, private residence owners would enjoy certain property rights for 70 years, while business property owners would only enjoy them for 50 years. After this period expired, the owner would have to pay a fee again.</p><br/><p>This applied to Qin Guan's shops on the Second East Ring. If Qin Guan had a child, he or she would have to pay a fee again for up to 100 houses, which was crazy.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan came back to reality and realized that he had reached the last page. It was a photo of a diamond shining in the sunshine. It was the treasure locked in the safe of his Swiss bank account.</p><br/><p>Tiffany and Cartier had carefully selected the raw gemstone for Qin Guan's wedding ceremony. The perfectly-cut blue diamond, which weighed 19.8 carats, would be inlaid in a ring.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan had spent a long time seeking a ring worthy of his girlfriend. It was lucky that he had participated in \"Lust, Caution\". The 6-carat diamond had shockingly come from Cartier.</p><br/><p>Even Qin Guan, who was used to owning such rare treasure, couldn't help but gasp in admiration.</p><br/><p>\"It's really beautiful, but the color will not suit her.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

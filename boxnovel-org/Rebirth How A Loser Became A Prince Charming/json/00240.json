He would be surrounded by gawkers whenever he strolled along the street.</p><br/><p>He scampered off like a frightened rat to training school with Cong Nianwei. A few days later, the courses would be finished and they would drift apart.</p><br/><p>The tutor was making a speech on the platform, giving them a pep talk for the following exams.</p><br/><p>He Ming murmured, \"That's why I hate new teachers. They are still new to their roles. Soon they won\u2019t be so excited anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Lan Jin was laughing in the front, his red hair shaking.</p><br/><p>He Ming hit him on the head. \"This is the last time we meet before the exams. We should take advantage of it and have a party together. We could look after each other in the US in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Lan Jin was in high spirits, when Qin Guan's phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's me, Brother Bu. What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>Bu Qinglu was lying on the couch in his office, his feet on the tea table. Two more guys were lying on the couch across from him.</p><br/><p>He spoke to the receiver loudly, \"I have two things to tell you. First, your roommates came here today with your VIP card and I led them to the third floor for free.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, Brother Bu. Just leave them alone. You don't need to take care of them.\"</p><br/><p>Bu grinned. \"Do you think I\u2019m a stingy man? I\u2019ll make them feel at home, don't worry.\"</p><br/><p>\"Second, you are our shareholder and CFO, right? I\u2019ve come across an opportunity here. Could you come over and give me some advice? The partner seems reliable, but you know I\u2019m only experienced in the service industry. Help me and I\u2019ll share the opportunity with you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I\u2019m coming. Will it take a lot of my time?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, we\u2019ll just meet them here and get a general idea of their plan. We\u2019ll decide what to do on the spot. They are old friends and pretty straightforward guys.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled. \"Okay. I have some new friends here. Could you give us some good rooms?\"</p><br/><p>Bu sounded much happier. He put his feet down and told Qin Guan in a mysterious voice. \"Quick! You\u2019ll really like it!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan hung up and asked He Ming and Guan Jian, \"Shall we go to the Fruit &amp; Candy Club? I have some friends there.\"</p><br/><p>He Ming and Guan Jian exchanged a glance and shrugged. \"Good choice.\"</p><br/><p>Did you forget to ask somebody else\u2019s opinion? Cong Nianwei always followed Qin Guan to any place he went for amusement.</p><br/><p>Did he even ask Lan Jin?</p><br/><p>Everyone always ignored him. The boy would be happy to go with them wherever they went.</p><br/><p>He was a textbook case of a guy with no friends, who didn\u2019t feel loved.</p><br/><p>After the teacher's 10-minute testimonial on graduation, the five boys left the classroom.</p><br/><p>Four vastly different cars roared to life. Led by Qin Guan\u2019s Cherokee, they drove in line, heading for the main road.</p><br/><p>It took them only 15 minutes to get to the club. They got out of their cars and entered through the gate.</p><br/><p>Qin Guan nodded at the manager and reached the third floor without any trouble.</p><br/><p>\"My roommates are also here. I have to go greet them.\"</p><br/><p>He Ming smiled. \"Your schoolmates? Let's go together.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan smiled back. \"Okay. Then we\u2019ll go to the fourth floor.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan pushed in and the happy laughter and cheerful voices inside stopped at once.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiaoyang was shouting at a microphone selflessly. The boy had taken off all the clothes on his upper body and tied ribbons on his head. A girl named Mimi or Lulu was applauding behind him.</p><br/><p>There were empty beer bottles on the floor. Li Jie, who was slightly drunk, was teasing a beautiful girl. There were lipstick stains all over his face.</p><br/><p>They were all stunned when Qin Guan entered. Li Jie fixed his eyes on him and grinned. \"Qin Guan, it's you! Come in! Let\u2019s have fun together!\"</p><br/><p>Before Qin Guan could say anything, he noticed that Liu Xiaoyang suddenly looked way more shocked than before. His eyeballs nearly dropped off his wide open eyes.</p><br/><p>He turned off the microphone and stood up straighter. Trembling, he told the man behind Qin Guan, \"B\u2026 Brother Guan, what are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Liu was famous for his sharp wit. Why was he stammering though? Did he know Guan Jian?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

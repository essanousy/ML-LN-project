According to native tradition, that was the only way to resist the wind. Qin Guan was standing in front of the camera.</p><br/><p>A shabby truck was approaching from afar. It was a shuttle bus used by the villagers on the plateau.</p><br/><p> This was the first time Qin Guan was experiencing a battle of wits and courage between the voluntary guards and the smugglers.</p><br/><p>Who knew that half a kilo of wool would cost 1,000 dollars and be sealed in a torn cotton jacket?</p><br/><p>The driver's clothes had been taken off. Qin Guan rubbed his face distraughtly. \"What shall we do with those?\"</p><br/><p>\"Let him go...\"</p><br/><p>\"Why?\"</p><br/><p>\"There are dozens of people smuggling goods for the poachers. Bus drivers, travelling doctors... We can't catch them all!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan sighed under the sky, unable to fathom the dirty deals humans made.</p><br/><p>The first scene came to an end.</p><br/><p>\"We could go to Chumar River by Lake Zhuonair,\" their guide told him.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of this, Qin Guan talked with the real heroes on their way there. They were all guards of the Tibetan antelopes. They would spend a large amount of their paychecks on equipment for their base.</p><br/><p>\"Is there someone stationed there?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. We are short on personnel, so it's just one guy. The poachers dare not approach though.\"</p><br/><p>\"How often do you relieve the guard?\"</p><br/><p> \"Never. He's been there for three years.\"</p><br/><p>Silence prevailed in the car. The old jeep was making cracking noises as it drove through the Gobi Desert. The sky seemed much clearer than before.</p><br/><p>They hurried on their way, driving day and night. The dull scenery made everyone sleepy. When they reached their destination though, Qin Guan suddenly came back to his senses.</p><br/><p>Chumar River was a fresh river winding through the unpopulated area. It was also an important location for the battle between the guards and the poachers.</p><br/><p>Their guide made a campfire, while the crew was busy with their props and equipment. In that unpopulated area, fire was absolutely necessary. Qin Guan put on his cap and got his camera ready. He was the only pretty boy among a group of tough men.</p><br/><p>The next scene was a simple yet hard chase. All they had to do was run across the shallow river and catch the poacher on the opposite bank, but they had to be half-naked while they waded into the cold water.</p><br/><p>Lu Chuan sighed before he shouted at Qin Guan and the Tibetan people, \"Run!\"</p><br/><p>At his order, the sturdy Tibetan warriors rushed to the bank without hesitation. Qin Guan followed them closely, unwilling to look weak before them.</p><br/><p>\"Take off your pants and cross the river!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone took off their pants and ran to the river. Bare legs and underwear were the only things visible on the camera.</p><br/><p>\"Ouch!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Guan felt terrible. The temperature was really low, and the chilling water felt as if it was biting his legs. His whole body was shaking. He panted as he moved his legs with all his might. The bank was only a few meters away, yet it seemed unreachable.</p><br/><p>They reached the opposite bank panting. Then they got some sad news.</p><br/><p>\"Once again! Some people were not visible on the camera!\"</p><br/><p>They had to repeat the scene 30 times!</p><br/><p>When Lu Chuan finally nodded in approval, Qin Guan collapsed on the ground. His bare legs felt numb, but the sunlight was unprecedentedly warm.</p><br/><p>After that battle, Qin Guan was accepted by the Tibetan men.</p><br/><p>\"You are really good, young man!\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! I'm no coward!\"</p><br/><p>\"Really? Stand up and dance!\"</p><br/><p>They all got to their feet and began dancing around the outsider, wild voices escaping their throats. Qin Guan lay on the ground, watching their long legs and underwear moving around above his head.</p><br/><p>He shouted along with the Tibetan men, their voices echoing around the desert.</p><br/><p>It felt wonderful to make some unexpected friends.</p><br/><p>In the following days, almost half the crew got sick because of the tough living conditions. They suffered from pneumonia, emphysema, fever and hypoxia. Their passion disappeared, making some of them abandon the whole endeavor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

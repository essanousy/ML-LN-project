Master control room.</p><br/><p>This place was noisier than a marketplace today. From employees responsible for airing to employees from other teams, they were all scrambling noisily while waving banknotes.</p><br/><p>\u201c2.5% for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that it\u2019s damn hot right now? 3% for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3.3%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Stop! The director is coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as someone shouted hurriedly, the control room\u2019s door flung open. Then Director Bae and General Manager Song of the drama department, as well as Director Shin Taekyun, entered. As it was a drama with so much interest, they planned on tracking the viewership rating in the master control room today.</p><br/><p>The people who had been whispering amongst each other quickly left while clearing their throats.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re betting on the viewership rating again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The technical director showed a bashful smile at General Manager Song\u2019s words. General Manager Song intercepted a post-it, which had the evidence of betting on the viewership ratings, and read it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost all are 3%?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the reactions are so heated, everyone held higher standards. Still, with this mood, it might reach 4% if we\u2019re lucky\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet 50,000 won<sup>[1]</sup> that it\u2019ll be higher than 4%.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Song took out a banknote from his wallet. The master control room employees showed startled expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral manager, isn\u2019t that too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are tons of dramas that don\u2019t reach 4% by the time they end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet on 5%.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Director Shin Taekyun this time. A 50,000-won-bill swayed in his hand.</p><br/><p>The technical team and programming team employees read the mood as they accepted their money. Afterwards, they whispered to each other that those men probably counted their chickens before they hatched in quiet voices so they wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><br/><p>However, the employees had to retract their thoughts in a few minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201c2 minutes in\u2026 Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant manager, who had been checking the time, halted after checking the graph recording the minute ratings in real-time. TVL\u2019s minute ratings were rising at a rate incomparable to other cable channels on at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, right now, uh, what the, it\u2019s already over 2%?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>A programming team employee read the mood behind him as he even tapped on the monitor. During this time, the line on the graph was quickly rising at a steep angle.</p><br/><p>The technical director gulped his saliva and mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow high will it rise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s going to reach 3% before it starts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then that possibility became a reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe-we reached 3% minute ratings at the start!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the better-than-expected start, the master control room became noisy.</p><br/><p>Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019s title screen flashed by. Then the best highlights picked from the edited version swept through. Cuts of the lead and supporting actors passed by at a breathtaking pace until it came to a sudden stop.</p><br/><p>It was Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>As if the director had planned it this way, there were a ton of highlight scenes of Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>The technical director forgot to pay attention to the graph as he looked at the screen.</p><br/><p>He had expected she would be good at acting since there had been a rumor that she was a great actress spreading within TVL. However, he didn\u2019t have high hopes. While he was in charge of the broadcasting in the master control room, he had seen his fill of actors who received high praise. Therefore, most things he saw weren\u2019t exciting anymore.</p><br/><p>However, he clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think I would have said that she was a natural without any truth? I even asked her to get psychological counseling.\u2019</p><br/><p>An interview with a camera operator followed after veteran actress Jang Yoonok\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why, you know those actors that come up occasionally. The ones that seem possessed by their character? I sometimes got shivers when I looked at her through a camera.\u2019</p><br/><p>The scene changed to the film set. A Lee Songha with a cold, depressed expression was edited next to a different Lee Songha, who was following behind her manager to maximize their contrast.</p><br/><p>The technical director nodded his head without knowing.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t this be what people call possessed?</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I-it passed 4%!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the cracking voice, the technical director came to his senses.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the minute ratings monitor. The moment they saw the graph, which had passed 4%, someone screamed in excitement. Soon after, a round of applause broke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost triple GTBN right now, triple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-at this rate, won\u2019t it really reach 5%?\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Song clenched his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, what did I say? This is a hit! As soon as it\u2019s been unveiled, the ratings passed 4%, 4%! If it\u2019s like this, we can compete against public networks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Bae nodded. Although he had a serious face, he too was stealthily clenching his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Shin, Shin Taekyun! You worked hard, buddy! Now, all we need to do is keep rising to the top! First, let CEO Kim Pansuk and W&amp;U\u2019s CEO Baek Hansung know the news, no, I\u2019ll personally call-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease watch quietly, general manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Shin Taekyun said. He hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off the minute by minute ratings for a while now. The chattering employees, director, and even the general manager once again looked at the monitor. No one could open their mouths.</p><br/><p>Within the silence filled with excitement, the ratings graph gradually rose higher.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung was sitting on her sofa with her legs crossed as she stared at her TV.</p><br/><p>There was only one thought on her mind.</p><br/><p>Fail.</p><br/><p>Because of Lee Songha and her manager, whom she didn\u2019t want to see, she had a loss of appetite these days. She was the kind of person who couldn\u2019t do anything if something bothering her. Only once she saw that drama go under with less than 1% ratings would her mind be at peace.</p><br/><p>Veteran actress Jang Yoonok\u2019s interview sounded from the TV.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think I would have said that she was a natural\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung, who had been biting her nails, threw whatever she could get her hands on at the TV.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t her eyes skewed? Well, that\u2019s probably why she\u2019s doing cable with her experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon the screen changed to show a scene of Lee Songha acting in the role of Jung Haewon. Son Chaeyoung unconsciously lowered her arm at the chilling scene.</p><br/><p>Her hairs stood on their end.</p><br/><p>She bit hard on her lower lip. Unable to continue looking at the screen any longer, she took her eyes off it and irritably pulled her laptop close. In times like these, it was best to look at hate comments swearing at Lee Songha to change her mood. Her mind would quickly relax like a calm lake.</p><br/><p>As soon as she opened a portal site, Lee Songha\u2019s name was first on real-time search rankings.</p><br/><p>Even the articles on the main page and the countless articles below it all had Lee Songha\u2019s name on them. The keywords were \u2018sweeping away her acting controversy\u2019. \u2018netizens\u2019 applause\u2019, \u2018best acting\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>Reporters, what do they know?</p><br/><p>Comments. Comments will be fine. Haters don\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>She went to a site that would indiscriminately curse and hate female celebrities. There were tons of related articles and comments. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s lips curled upwards.</p><br/><p>-It looks like the director ground his teeth to make this and put the controversies to rest. Just look at this we can tell she\u2019s good at acting.</p><br/><p>-Are all the people who had been swearing at her, saying she wouldn\u2019t be good at acting, kicking their blankets? It\u2019s so quiet. I knew this would happen.</p><br/><p>-With no experience, and no talks about her learning acting for a long time, she got hate because they said she was a natural or whatever, at looking at her now, it seems saying that she\u2019s a natural was reasonable. It doesn\u2019t even look like she\u2019s acting.</p><br/><p>-Even Jang Yoonok asked her to consult with a psychologist. I\u2019m a little worried tbh.</p><br/><p>-But it looks like this will have incredibly high ratings. The drama looks like a heck of a lot of fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Astonished, Son Chaeyoung threw her laptop. Still angry, she threw her remaining pots, remote, and even the Mermaid out of Water script in irritation.</p><br/><p>Nervously going back and forth in her living room, Son Chaeyoung called Chief Jo. A commercial was playing after the Cat Guardian Ghost broadcast had ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, what were its ratings? You checked, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she shouted fiercely, Chief Jo mumbled in a reluctant voice.</p><br/><p>-That is, umm, Chaeyoung\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were its ratings?! 2%? 3%?\u201d</p><br/><p>-So that is, that\u2026 Haaa.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s forehead distorted at the ominous sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026. Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s 4%?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Chaeyoung. Once Mermaid out of Water comes out, it\u2019ll get great ratings too. You can get twice, no, triple the ratings of Cat Guardian Ghost. So\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s obvious! So what are its ratings?!\u201d</p><br/><p>-I\u2019ll te-text you.</p><br/><p>Chief Jo hung up as if he was distancing himself from a bomb. Then, a few seconds later, a text appeared on her phone. After hurriedly checking it, Son Chaeyoung stiffened. She blinked her eyes but the number didn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A chaotic aura appeared in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Son Chaeyoung began screaming as she smashed the items around her.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a low laughter echoed in the CEO\u2019s office at W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s like this from the start, then I\u2019ll expectant how high it\u2019ll go from now. Don\u2019t worry about her condition. I\u2019ll look out for her, and even now\u2026 she has a good manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>After exchanging a few more pleasant words, CEO Baek Hansung hung up.</p><br/><p>After placing his phone down, he stood up from his chair. Then he walked a few steps and stood in front of a wall. It was packed with pictures of celebrities under W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>He rubbed his lips as he gazed at an empty space. It was the place Sung Dowon\u2019s picture had been hung. Thinking about putting Lee Songha there instead, he suddenly lowered his gaze.</p><br/><p>He looked at a picture of a brightly smiling Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>He silently looked at the picture before stretching his hand out.</p><br/><p>With the tip of his long finger, he tapped on her face as if in thought.</p><br/><p>And in Jongno District. In G-Today\u2019s entertainment department\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Reporter Park Woojeong glanced at the clutter of references and materials on her desk as she passionately tapped on her keyboard. Her hair, which she pulled on intermittently, had already become a rat\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>Other employees passed by her while clicking their tongues. Not caring about them, she leaned her face closer to the monitor as if she was about to crawl in it. Her screen was scattered with Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019s broadcast, real-time search rankings, and reaction comments.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201dHey, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprised, she turned around to see a man with a messy beard standing behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, general manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that everyone\u2019s pouring out articles about Lee Songha? You should be publishing articles even a second faster, why are you holding onto it so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit close with Lee Songha\u2019s manager so I wanted to write it earnestly\u2026 I\u2019ll publish it immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hastily grabbing Reporter Park Woojeong\u2019s shoulder, her general manager asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close with Lee Songha\u2019s manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you should have told me. People are desperately trying to get an interview with Lee Songha and anyone involved right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her general manager\u2019s eyes shined as he added,</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk the manager for an interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo frowned. After looking back at his phone a couple times, he asked again,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat percent was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>While listening to what the other side was saying, Kim Hyunjo\u2019s expression gradually turned strange. Like meerkats, we stretched our necks and looked at Kim Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>Just what was it? What percent was it? I was so curious I could die. It must have done better than Next K-Star since people\u2019s reactions were incomparably more heated than that. Also, internet aside, my phone was creating a fuss for a while now. The calls and messages this morning were cute compared to right now. I felt that my fingerprints would wear out writing all those replies.</p><br/><p>Just then, Kim Hyunjo hung up. Im Seoyoung immediately asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat percent was it?! Quickly, quickly tell me! I\u2019m going to die of anticipation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo slumped onto the sofa.</p><br/><p>Then he looked at each of us once, especially Lee Songha and me.</p><br/><p>\u201c5<sup>th</sup> place in TVL\u2019s all-time drama ratings was 5.9%. Winter Sun.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they said Cat Guardian Ghost hit 6% today. Since they only have the real-time ratings right now, we won\u2019t know precisely until tomorrow, but it won\u2019t be much different.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, no one showed any sort of reaction. Everyone was probably deciphering the number Kim Hyunjo had just said.</p><br/><p>I was too.</p><br/><p>Although my expectations were high since the reactions on the internet were so explosive\u2026</p><br/><p>6%?</p><br/><p>A cable drama, that only just started, got 6%?</p><br/><p>\u201cAl-all-time 5<sup>th</sup>\u2026 Doesn\u2019t that mean it\u2019s really good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung stuttered. LJ had a dazed expression as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs\u2026 n\u2019t it? I mean how many dramas have TVL broadcasted so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, right? It\u2019s a success, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung slapped my back with both hands as she asked.</p><br/><p>I gulped my saliva and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a resounding success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung screamed at the top of her lungs. Lee Taehee and LJ stuck next to Lee Songha with bright complexions. Then, with Lee Songha, who was still caught up in the lingering feelings after the broadcast, in the middle, the two chatted noisily. Of course, 95% of it was Im Seoyoung\u2019s voice, but their voices clearly contained their excitement.</p><br/><p>After ending a call with someone else, Kim Hyunjo gestured to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Team Leader Park, and she says it\u2019s crazy in the PR team right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said inquiries by people who now want a piece of the cake are flooding in. Since there are so many calls, she said it\u2019s not a PR team but a call center. Apparently, she said it already feels like the drama hit 10% ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>As his smile curled all the way up his ears, Kim Hyunjo slapped my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>How do I feel, huh?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you only brought the opportunity for Neptune to appear on Next K-Star, isn\u2019t this time something you brought up with your own hands? You received the synopsis, pushed Lee Songha to act, and even preparations for the audition and film shoots. What you brought up has become a success right now, so how do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>How do I feel now that the first drama I was involved with has broadcasted?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo laughed loudly like a drunken person.</p><br/><p>I was filled with pride. My chest felt stiff, and my heart felt like it would explode. If there wasn\u2019t anyone here, I might have shouted refreshingly. Also, I might have called my parents and my brother and bragged on and on. They would all be very happy.</p><br/><p>I clenched my fists.</p><br/><p>Like Kim Hyunjo said, I had suffered hardships and brought it up to this point, and it returned to me as a great success. I felt that I accomplished something that I could hold with my own two hands, drunk from people\u2019s acknowledgment of me and my fruits of labor. It was an amazing feeling.</p><br/><p>I looked at Lee Songha, who was buried under the girls, receiving their congratulations. She had been gawking just now, but she was smiling brightly right now, perhaps due to the girls causing such a large commotion.</p><br/><p>Yeah, smile. It\u2019s a day you can\u2019t help but smile.</p><br/><p>The people who had hated on Lee Songha were dispirited, pushed aside by the masses. Instead, it felt like there were people crowding at hate comments, tearing them apart. This was because there were people uploading evidence of others who had previously hated and bashed Lee Songha because of her controversies, and sympathy for Lee Songha spreading like wildfire. Neptune\u2019s fan cafe, as well as Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019s fan cafe, were filled with supportive comments.</p><br/><p>From now on, she wouldn\u2019t have to suffer like in the past.</p><br/><p>Now, there was no need to take Lee Songha\u2019s phone away, and there would be no need to feel down because of people\u2019s mocking looks anymore.</p><br/><p>As if she noticed my gaze, Lee Songha looked at me. Our eyes momentarily met. Her picturesque eyes smiled slightly. How many emotions passed by in that brief moment? If possible, I wanted to stop time and closely examine them.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who was about to approach me, was grabbed by Im Seoyoung\u2019s hand and was shaken, while I turned my head at Kim Hyunjo\u2019s call.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I bet the mood at Neptune\u2019s album meeting will be great tomorrow because of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Park told me to bring you, saying that there are a lot of people who want to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo gave a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. You really are a lucky charm. Even when I saw you for the first time, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He went on about the repertoire I had heard multiple times.</p><br/><p>Soon, we began a simple celebration, although it later changed to a drinking party once Kim Hyunjo brought out another wild ginseng wine the team 3 leader gave him. I felt this last time as well, but the wine\u2019s effects were amazing. After two hours, there was almost no one in their right mind anymore.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who had been nodding her head constantly, eventually slumped over. When I barely managed to lean her against the sofa, she had a faint smile as she mumbled something. Just what was she eating in her dreams after finishing off a chicken?</p><br/><p>I looked at the living room, which looked more like a mess than a girl group\u2019s residence, and at the people who were collapsed like stragglers, but there was someone missing.</p><br/><p>The traitor wasn\u2019t here.</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, I felt like I didn\u2019t see him for a while. Did he go out to smoke again?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Choi Gunyoung entered the quiet residence.</p><br/><p>It seemed they had dragged the Neptune members back to their rooms as only Kim Hyunjo and Jung Sunwoo were wearing their outerwear as they nodded off.</p><br/><p>Choi Gunyoung stood in front of Jung Sunwoo and looked down at him.</p><br/><p>You couldn\u2019t find a smile on his always smiling face. He was cold and rigid like lead.</p><br/><p>He clenched his phone in his hand as he thought that if today was Jung Sunwoo\u2019s day, then tomorrow would be his.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup> [1]</sup> 44 USD.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-61\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 61\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-63\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 63\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201237\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

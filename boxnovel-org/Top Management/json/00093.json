Amidst the staff, who were bustling to prepare for the outdoor shoot, there were two vans of the same design but different colors.</p><br/><p>When I opened the driver\u2019s seat door out of habit, the two people who were already inside turned their gazes towards me.</p><br/><p>One was Hwang Jaehyun, who I had talked to before. The other was the youngest character on \u2018Now, We\u2019, Im Joowon, an actor.</p><br/><p>As soon as I greeted them, Hwang Jaehyun dropped his formal speech and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou picked a card too, right? What kind of power is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I can see the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo. 28 years old. Future Prophet.</p><br/><p>What should I say? It seemed like words had power. Once my biggest secret, which I had kept hidden for almost half a year and would continue to do so from now on, left my lips, I felt refreshed all the way from my belly.</p><br/><p>Hwang Jaehyun and Im Joowon each had their own power. While I was listening to their explanations, other people soon arrived as well. The child actress Song Yuri, Lee Taehee, and Lee Songha, who sat next to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, what did you pick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHypnotist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha replied with a proud expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can hypnotize one person and make him mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I just need to hypnotize that person and write my name on his forehead. I think I chose well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing as she stared at my forehead after saying that, I had a feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t trying to use it on me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha avoided my gaze and focused on something else. So she was going to.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy use that on me? What use will I be after you hypnotize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. This or that.\u201d</p><br/><p>So what were they!</p><br/><p>When I told her to aim for someone else besides me, she looked at me with an expression that asked, \u2018Why?\u2019 While telling her that she would get more screen time and it would be more fun if she used it on a cast member, I heard Hwang Jaehyun\u2019s voice from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, Im Joohwan\u2019s reactions were a bit weird. I could tell that his pretty face, which ignited women\u2019s maternal instincts, was a bit stiff. He was also glancing at me and Lee Songha since a while ago.</p><br/><p>Hwang Jaehyun waved his hand as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just jealous. The lead male role for Cat Guardian Ghost was offered to him first. Mr. Seo Jijoon\u2019s role. If he had done it, he would have been a big hit right about now. Since he kicked that away, how upset must he be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really, hyung!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about it now, there were articles regarding Im Joohwan before Seo Jijoon. Something about him being injured?</p><br/><p>When I glanced at him, Im Joohwan was making an irritated face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could have made it for the drama since it was a minor injury, but my company told me not to do it. Saying that it wouldn\u2019t do well and that I should just use my injury as an excuse to refuse. The hell they mean by it wouldn\u2019t do well? Damn company! They\u2019re no use. After my contract ends, I\u2019m going to leave it without turning back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m slowly starting to look for a company too, sunbaenim<sup>{1}</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Yuri, who was sitting in the middle, joined in while blinking cutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil now, my uncle managed my schedule, but it\u2019s a bit frustrating. If I want to transform into an adult actress later on, I felt that I would need a company.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two went back and forth discussing a few management companies. They were all management companies that were famous in this industry.</p><br/><p>Well, if it were those two, then almost all companies would welcome them. Im Joohwan was a star actor who could play lead roles on public networks, and Song Yuri was a child actress with outstanding potential, having received the Best New Actress Award at a film festival, which was unprecedented for a child actress.</p><br/><p>My company would welcome them as well. The PR Team seemed to be constantly looking actors entering the free contract market. Should I try my hand?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about W&amp;U?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two stopped talking once they heard my words.</p><br/><p>Im Joohwan and Song Yuri stared at me. Just as my cheeks were heating up, Im Joohwan asked with a strange expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you scouting us right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to reply while smiling when Producer Bae stuck his head in through the van window.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuperhumans, are you ready to move?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is this all? Where are the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hwang Jaehyun\u2019s question, the producer gestured towards the white van standing a bit away from us. Writer Song was there, explaining something to them, and I caught a glimpse of LJ and Im Seoyoung through the door opening.</p><br/><p>Producer Bae spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, we divided you into two teams: the Superhuman team and the Researcher team. The Superhuman team has to be careful not to get caught by the Researcher team. Since superhumans are valuable test subjects, you will be dragged to their research lab if you are caught.\u201d</p><br/><p>Valuable what?</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that too cruel? What have the superhumans done?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked sincerely. I already had a nightmare where a mad scientist found out about my foresight ability and kidnapped me. I woke up after being bound up tightly and laid down on a surgical table.</p><br/><p>With a brazen face, the producer stared at me as if asking what was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the way of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a rated G entertainment show to take on such a world view devoid of hopes and dreams\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the world has always been like this. Even kids know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was okay for kids to watch this program, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen before we head out, Mr. Sunwoo, please see the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer handed me a box the size of my head. Inside were a few different colored dice, and there were stickers on each of the six faces. The people at the back chatted noisily as they leaned their heads forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just need to throw the dice all at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there some sort of chant when using your superpower?\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost swore at Hwang Jaehyun in front of the cameras.</p><br/><p>When I imagined myself chanting, \u2018Come out, future!\u2019 while holding the dice, shivers ran down my entire body. No way. There was no way, right? If I had to do something like that, then I might really see a future where I die. This time, my cause of death would be out of humiliation for sure.</p><br/><p>The producer glanced at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want a chant, \u2018Moon Prism Power, With Light-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll just throw them. I\u2019ll throw them right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without breathing, I threw the dice all at once. I heard someone sigh in regret beside me. When I turned to look at her, Lee Songha acted otherwise.</p><br/><p>Hitting the walls of the box, the rolling dice stopped one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow take off the sticker on top and see the event that will happen in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Producer Bae\u2019s request, I began tearing off the stickers, starting with the red die.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Superhuman team will, in one hour, on the streets of Sinchon, with civilians, complete a mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haha, so this was what future foresight was. If the futures I had seen were even half as clear as this, I might have already become a chief. Licking my lips, I returned the dice.</p><br/><p>Then we drove to Sinchon as the future indicated.</p><br/><p>Of course, we played Neptune\u2019s new songs loudly in the van.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people because it\u2019s the weekend. Everyone, be careful while on your mission so that there aren\u2019t any accidents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Bae asked us as soon as we came out of the van.</p><br/><p>There were clearly a lot of people. Since it was the weekend, they had even restricted traffic. From the sidewalks to even the asphalt road, the entire Yonsei Street was crowded with people. Wherever I looked, I saw couples, and there were a lot of families with strollers.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhh! It\u2019s Im Joowon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the \u2018Now, We\u2019 team over there? Right? Hey, hurry up! They are filming something here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like Song Yuri\u2019s a guest! Who\u2019s that next to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Neptune? Oh, my god. Seeing their appearance in person\u2026 Amazing! Let\u2019s go closer!\u201d</p><br/><p>People began to gather around us as soon as we entered the streets. Because of the filming staff, they weren\u2019t able to come too close. All the women looked at Im Joowon and the men watched Lee Songha and Lee Taehee as their excitement heightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019re going to be squashed. The weather\u2019s gloomy, yet they still came out on dates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019ll be difficult for the Researcher team to find us because of all the people, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwang Jaehyun shrugged at Im Joowon\u2019s complaint. Then he asked Lee Taehee,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re probably going to have to run today. How are Neptune\u2019s athletic abilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn our group, LJ is the best since she boxes as a hobby. Seoyoung practiced dancing since she was young so she\u2019s good too. Songha, if you provide her with sufficient fuel, ah, if you give her food, she can move well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m awful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee replied without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwful? How are you at running?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never run since the physical fitness test during high school\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking off into the distance, Lee Taehee took something out from her pocket and ate it. It was a ginseng jelly, a healthy food she received from a fan. Seeing her like this, Hwang Jaehyun clicked his tongue with an expression that read, \u2018There\u2019s no hope for her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, quickly give us the mission! So that we can complete it quickly and flee before the Researcher team gets here!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Im Joowon\u2019s urgings, the producer handed out mission cards. On my card, it said to bring a same-aged couple.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaehee, what does yours say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy two fresh fruit juices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee replied while looking around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMine says to bring a baby boy on a stroller.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, theirs weren\u2019t too picky. Mine was the pickiest. While there were countless couples, I had to ask each of them to see if they were the same age.</p><br/><p>I separated from the girls and went into the crowd of people. The cameraman assigned to me chased after me. I asked smiling couples for their understanding and age.</p><br/><p>However, it felt weird standing amidst people who came to leisurely enjoy their weekend.</p><br/><p>Should I say that I felt like I became distanced from this normal scene after living busily in the entertainment industry all this time? A sudden sense of reality overcame me.</p><br/><p>On my next break, I must meet a friend or someone.</p><br/><p>Resolving myself, I was about to ask my fourth couple.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you Jung Sunwoo? Right? Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, a familiar couple was looking at me. The one who clearly called my name was the man. I definitely remembered his face, but was he my university colleague? Or from high school? I couldn\u2019t remember his name.</p><br/><p>When I smacked my lips, the man\u2019s complexion crumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t remember me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. I have trouble recognizing faces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKim Taejong, man! Kim Taejong! But what are you doing these days? Did you come here alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guy, who just told me his name on his own, looked up and down at me while questioning me. Seeing as he was pulling his girlfriend\u2019s shoulder in, it seemed he wanted to ask if I was single on this spring weekend.</p><br/><p>A stronger sense of reality overwhelmed me like a tsunami.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou used look after kids all the time instead of coming to the PC room<sup>{2}</sup>. Like some boy breadwinner with a bunch of younger siblings. Do you still look after them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was taking care of some girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnjoy your life a little. We\u2019ll be thirty soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kim Taejong said this, his girlfriend tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaejong, did I see your friend before? He seems familiar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, how would you have seen him if this is my first time seeing him in a long time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than their conversation, I heard their casual speech<sup>{3}</sup>.</p><br/><p>They were the same age! I quickly smiled friendlily at Kim Taejong and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the same age as your girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, why\u2026? Hey, doesn\u2019t it seem like that cameraman is filming us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Taejong suddenly tidied his hair as he looked behind me. The cameraman was still filming me from a little distance away. I was about to explain in detail to Kim Taejong and ask for his cooperation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha approached me from my right.</p><br/><p>With a slightly smiling face and while carefully pushing a stroller. Behind her lush hair that fluttered in the wind were men who followed behind her like zombies, completely entranced.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I think I\u2019m almost done too. I met someone I knew-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you get married?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Taejong suddenly said something ridiculous. He foolishly looked at Lee Songha and the stroller before looking back at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-did you marry? Did you marry th\u2026 that person? Is that your kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to prevent someone\u2019s chances of getting married?<sup>{4}</sup> That\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Of course, no wonder. The kid didn\u2019t resemble you. I was shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind Lee Songha, a young couple, who looked to be the baby\u2019s parents, laughed while covering their mouths. I was about to explain the situation to Kim Taejong once again, but this time, I heard a commotion from my left.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, I bought fresh fruit juice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee came out through the crowd holding a green juice glass in each hand.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because of crowd of people, but she approached me with unusually swift steps. She looked at Kim Taejong and tilted her head. Kim Taejong opened and closed his mouth before asking me,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t tell me, she\u2019s-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Whatever you\u2019re thinking of, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Neptune!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Taejong\u2019s girlfriend shouted out of the blue. Then she pointed at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Neptune, right? And, you\u2019re their manager, right? The one who appeared on the New Year\u2019s Special!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We are currently filming \u2018From Now On, We\u2019re\u2019. If you have the time, would you mind doing a mission with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s fine! Oh, my! What do I do?! I\u2019m totally fine! We can just cancel the movie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was explaining the situation to the two people in detail, there was a commotion behind me this time. Wondering who it was this time, I turned around and flinched.</p><br/><p>I saw familiar faces. LJ and Im Seoyoung were running straight at us.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa! Stay there! Don\u2019t run away!\u201d</p><br/><p>I understood the situation as soon as I heard Im Seoyoung shouting forebodingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, hey, we should run.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked Kim Taejong and his girlfriend to wait a little, and we quickly scattered to avoid LJ and Im Seoyoung. I was wondering how we would complete our mission now that we had been seen.</p><br/><p>Then, in front of me, an ear-piercing scream erupted amidst the crowd of people.</p><br/><p>Then a second and third time. The screams quickly spread. At first, I thought Im Joowon was doing something. Or that the \u2018Now, We\u2019 team had gathered and were inciting cheers. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else that could bring about such an intense reaction besides those two.</p><br/><p>However, something was off. These weren\u2019t happy screams from seeing celebrities. They seemed as though they were stricken with fear. \u2018Avoid it!\u2019 \u2018Run!\u2019 Screams like these that didn\u2019t suit this place were mixed in as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think something\u2019s happening over there? Uhh, why are those people acting like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck! Someone\u2019s going to get hurt!\u201d</p><br/><p>People around me murmured.</p><br/><p>The screaming people ran in our direction as if running away from something. I figured out the reason a few seconds later. An old truck loaded with water bottles was rushing towards us. Through a street packed with people.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Just what was that person doing? Was he insane?</p><br/><p>A fleeing woman was hit by the truck. Screams erupted all around.</p><br/><p>As if swaying, the truck turned and rushed side to side. People scattered like a swarm of minnows hit by a rock. An abnormal event was occurring in this place, which had been extremely normal only moments ago.</p><br/><p>Wait, where were the girls?</p><br/><p>I hastily looked around within the confusion. LJ and Im Seoyoung were far away, and Lee Taehee was a bit away as well. Lee Songha had abandoned the stroller and was hugging the baby.</p><br/><p>She was in the direction the truck was charging at.</p><br/><p>Without having the mind to comprehend the situation, I shot forward. Lee Songha, who was running away while hugging the baby, seemed to trip on something as she fell over. When she got back up, the truck was right in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked in my direction. An unknown expression brushed across her shocked face. I ran forward and embraced Lee Songha and the baby. I heard the sound of tires scratching the asphalt.</p><br/><p>It was going to hit us.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this, Lee Taehee suddenly pushed my back forcefully.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> I\u2019d usually find an English equivalent, but in this case, since both Song Yuri and Im Joohwan are young, it felt odd calling Im Joohwan \u2018senior\u2019. Sunbae \u2013 senior in the same industry, work, organization, etc. Side note: Song Yuri uses a much more formal version \u2013 sunbaenim.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> PC Room/Bang \u2013 Places where you can pay to use the computer, mainly for games.

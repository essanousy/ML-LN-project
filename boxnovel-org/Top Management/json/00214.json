Detestable. Sneaky. No, these were excessively nice descriptions.</p><br/><p>These pieces of trash.</p><br/><p>{This Year\u2019s Hot Keyword for Films, Interest in Crowdfunding Soars.}</p><br/><p>{Two Films Attempt Crowdfunding, \u2018City Jungle\u2019 and \u2018Supernatural\u2019}</p><br/><p>{Supernatural Opens Crowdfunding with an 800-Million-Won Goal, \u2018Largest Ever\u2019}</p><br/><p>\u2026 Director Cha Jaeho of Supernatural stated that \u2018Mr. Heo Kakyung, the lead, expressed he wanted to use crowdfunding the join the audience together\u2019 and that \u2018they decided to proceed after confirming that it was a good project in a meeting\u2019.</p><br/><p>Additionally, in regards to the other film their crowdfunding project overlaps with, City Jungle (Director Oh Hyunkyung, Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon as leads), he said, \u201cI have a close relationship with Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, who first planned the crowdfunding event. I also sent him my scenario while he succumbed to the pressure of choosing his next project\u201d and that \u2018he wished both films would have good results even though they are competitors, so that it would add more energy to the national film industry\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>Hahaha, how absurd.</p><br/><p>Supernatural was dragging us by our hair for their marketing strategy.</p><br/><p>They constantly mentioned City Jungle in their crowdfunding press release and kept bringing up Lee Songha and me as well. It was all so that those looking for more information on City Jungle, Lee Songha, or me would naturally see information about Supernatural as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, Supernatural might appear as a top search keyword amongst City Jungle related searches!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, did they shove their manners down the toilet? Isn\u2019t this too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was looking to regain my senses, the PR Team\u2019s female and male employees, the Team 3 Leader as well as others surrounded a monitor and were discussing. Realizing the mood wasn\u2019t very good, the camera director had long since left with his camera.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeo Kakyung brought it up first? Look at how they are using the actor as a scapegoat in case they get criticized!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt did work though. Looking at the comments, \u2018Kakyung oppa is famous for loving his audience. Let\u2019s hit ten million viewers. Fighting!\u2019 is what someone wrote. \u2018I looked up what kind of movie Supernatural was, and it\u2019s a blockbuster with a 15 billion won budget\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Sung Uimin said as he looked at his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s Team Leader Park?\u201d</p><br/><p>The PR Team female employee replied with an agitated face,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is flipping out- I mean lodging a complaint to Supernatural\u2019s marketing agency!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccumbed? Succumbed to the pressure of choosing his next project?! Have you seen Jung Sunwoo ever succumb?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Team Leader Park was flipping out.</p><br/><p>With her phone stuck to her ear, she approached us while shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if promoting City Jungle isn\u2019t my business, promoting Jung Sunwoo is my business! It\u2019s not like he had an interview with a reporter. Even if Director Cha Jaeho did say that, you should have removed it from the press release! Don\u2019t you know this is a sensitive subject?! Already, reporters\u2019 eyes are shining, looking to prey on anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park\u2019s torrential criticism ended with,</p><br/><p>\u201cStop saying sorry, and make sure not to do it again. I hope that we never have to call you again for something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hanging up, Team Leader Park let out a sigh. The Team 3 Leader said in a dazed voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you too harsh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a company known to have hired part-timers to review bomb competing films. They\u2019ll look down on us if we tried to talk nicely. They know not to mess with us if we flip out like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park looked towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you ever hear any unpleasant words from Director Cha Jaeho? If they are mentioning you, we probably have to intimidate them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnpleasant words.\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled my memories before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou work so foolishly. Han Seoyeon is much better than Lee Songha. Stuff like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t do anything when you heard that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I told him that I thought Supernatural was going to be a huge flop and that there was no need for me to put my actors in to flop with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>My surroundings became quiet. Team Leader Park opened and closed her mouth a couple times before changing the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cSBE Film is going to discuss with their marketing agency about the crowdfunding. They are probably in an uproar too. They sold your name for the past six months trying to raise people\u2019s interest and expectations, only to have Supernatural take the first bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face became distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat pisses me off more is that this will be greatly effective in promoting Supernatural.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was greatly effective.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to say about how they swept through the real-time search rankings. As soon as Supernatural\u2019s crowdfunding event became known, people quickly went to invest.</p><br/><p>Well, it was objectively an appealing option. It was a large-scale blockbuster. It had a well-known director and top star leads. Supporting roles were also famous for being great in their roles.</p><br/><p>The number of investors and the amount of funds received kept going up without hesitation.</p><br/><p>And, in just one day, they surpassed 200 million won.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporters wrote articles about how Supernatural would reach the highest crowdfunding goal among national films at this rate. Ln a large portal site, articles about Supernatural, albeit with different headlines, continued to be in the \u2018Most Viewed News\u2019 section.</p><br/><p>Even the public who invested in Supernatural became marketers as they spread information about Supernatural here and there.</p><br/><p>During this time, City Jungle staff were suffering from symptoms</p><br/><p>Their stomachs hurt, heartburns, and irritation.</p><br/><p>It was a disorder caused by rage.</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s project producer complained every day about how his stomach hurt and felt like his insides were twisted. The only calm person was Director Oh Hyunkyung who still locked herself in the editing room.</p><br/><p>Anyways, even in this situation, City Jungle\u2019s promotional activities were proceeding smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Geumjoo\u2019s Culture Storage! This week, we had Mr. Jung Sunwoo, and we introduced City Jungle, which is about to be released. Join us next week for more plentiful news!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter shouted the close remark of the info program. The staff went up onto the studio to prepare for the next segment. As soon as I handed my mic over to the audio team, the producer and main writer approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung! You\u2019re going to help us cast an actor next week, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a recording of it. We really will call you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The main writer, who laughed in a friendly manner, added,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right! City Jungle\u2019s crowdfunding must have started already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it should be around an hour since it started.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied after checking my watch. Today was the grand opening of the crowdfunding event.</p><br/><p>Right now, all the City Jungle staff were probably hung up on the crowdfunding platform. They were probably waiting impatiently for the aggregate results. After thanking the producer and writer, who said they would participate in funding, I went back to the waiting room to get my things.</p><br/><p>I barely managed to retain ahold of my senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector! I am interested in acting, so can\u2019t you use me in a minor role next time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too, unni? I received acting lessons in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, my goal was to be a comedian/actor\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfamiliar celebrities were trying to strike a friendship in front of my waiting room. There were rookie girl group idols and a comedian. I checked the door in case I came to the wrong place, but it had \u2018Jung Sunwoo\u2019 in big letters.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait. The waiting room owner has arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard a familiar voice. When I turned my head, I unconsciously frowned.</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho was sitting amongst the celebrities.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, uh, hello!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello!\u201d</p><br/><p>The celebrities greeted me with surprise.</p><br/><p>Soon, Director Cha Jaeho chased the others away. Only after we were the only ones left in the room did he speak again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came for a radio show, and I heard that you happened to be filming here too. So I came over to say hi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy bother/\u201d</p><br/><p>With our relationship?</p><br/><p>My thoughts blurted out my mouth. Director Cha Jaeho\u2019s brows moved up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you that the trend of crowdfunding began. This is a better marketing tool than I initially thought. We also receive investments. A stock firm said that our total funds and the rate we received funds is the best thus far.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, is it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do now that we beat historic records before you? We should leave City Jungle with something at least. I heard City Jungle started crowdfunding today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho mocked. Maybe it was because he was an eyesore, but every orifice of his face irritated me. His creased forehead wrinkles looked like he was needlessly stubborn, and his thin lips made it seem like he was a horrible character.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you come here to pick a fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I asked, Director Cha Jaeho got up from the sofa and came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to have you face reality. My film, which you rejected because you thought it would flop, is a work that has both commercial value and essential elements for box office success. Whether you call it dull or that we sold our soul for commercial value, in the end, the audience will buy tickets. Can\u2019t you tell by how people are clamoring to invest as soon as we set crowdfunding up?\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes glimmered with excitement. He repeatedly pushed my shoulder with his index finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you feel? Isn\u2019t it time for you to regret your decision? If you still haven\u2019t figured it out, then you\u2019re hopeless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although there were multiple times where I thought, \u2018just where did a guy like him come from,\u2019 this man was the most absurd amongst all of them. To think that the guy causing trouble for me just because I rejected his scenario is one of the famous individuals in the movie industry.</p><br/><p>Even now, his expression read, \u2018You dare reject my work? Do you even know who I am?\u2019 Oh my god. Would he be satisfied if I said, \u2018Sorry for not seeing this sooner, teacher.<sup>{1}</sup> I was blind.\u2019</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t do that.</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho became more intimidating when I didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You dare reject my film because you think it\u2019ll flop? In all my twenty years as a director\u2026 It was so absurd that it appeared in my dreams!\u201d</p><br/><p>That was some good news.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you, who chase after celebrities, squawk in front of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you answered in a crude manner after I put it politely. That was why I matched your preferences and spoke crudely. I guess you didn\u2019t really like that. Also, I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding, but even if there was on City Jungle, I still wouldn\u2019t have done Supernatural.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bastard. The first digit of my age is changing this year too.\u201d <sup>{2}</sup></p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho, who was glaring at me, made a sarcastic remark,</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing as your neck is still upright, I guess your film came out quite good. I saw that scenario too. Since it is my competitor. Well, it was okay. However, no matter how artistic you create a film, the audience in our country don\u2019t like dark, difficult films.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed certain at this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a clear limit. Even if rumors spread about how good the film is, at most, you\u2019ll have a million viewers. Well-Made will get you in theatres at first, and people will gather since they are curious, however, that\u2019ll only be for a moment. I bet that the number of viewers will half in a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I guess you can see the future. What an interesting ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious without that. The film market is pretty much a fight for a larger slice of the pie. How long do you think a film that turned its back on the public will last again blockbusters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, my phone rang. It was SBE Film\u2019s project producer.</p><br/><p>I left Director Cha Jaeho aside and answered the phone. The background was full of loud noises.</p><br/><p>-Team leader! It\u2019s over! We\u2019re done!</p><br/><p>Done?</p><br/><p>My heart dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What is?\u201d</p><br/><p>-The crowdfunding!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt started one hour ago? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s over! We surpassed our goal of 300 million! In an hour!</p><br/><p>This guy must be experiencing side effects after taking too many pills for his heartburn\u2026 There\u2019s no way that\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>The crowdfunding has ended? We gathered 300 million in one hour? Not even a day?</p><br/><p>Was that possible?</p><br/><p>I first put down my phone. I gulped dryly before turning my gaze.</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho was looking at me with his arms crossed. It seemed the project producer\u2019s voice didn\u2019t leak out. Director Cha Jaeho seemed to have assumed that there was a problem with funding from just my words as he arrogantly began talking about funding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas City Jungle\u2019s goal 300 million? I was thinking about investing around 2 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke as I hurriedly got my bag form the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Do you not want my money? But our marketing agency said it would be a good idea. It\u2019ll be newsworthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t accept even if we wanted to, though we don\u2019t. The funding\u2019s over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe funding. We checked the aggregate total, and it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe reached our 300-million-won goal in one hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho simply blinked.</p><br/><p>My expression was probably the same just moments ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I think I need to head back quickly. Ah, you can rest easy here.\u201d</p><br/><p>All he could do was open and close his mouth as he was so taken aback. Leaving him behind, I left the waiting room.</p><br/><p>Behind me, I heard loud noises like a table being flipped.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Teacher here is used as a form of respect, how you would talk to someone deserving of respect.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> The word \u2018bastard\u2019 can also refer to babies as well.

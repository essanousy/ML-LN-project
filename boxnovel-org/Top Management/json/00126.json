It was wet everywhere I touched. When I licked my lips, I tasted alcohol.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, what do I do? Oppa, does it hurt/\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was rubbing my face with the sleeve of her bathrobe. Even though her movements were hasty, she was careful like she was touching a wet chick. Since there weren\u2019t just one or two people looking at us, I pushed Lee Songha\u2019s hand away and wiped my face with the back of my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, but Sonha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I told you to discuss with me if you wanted to throw something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though she said her hands felt empty and even if it was out of reflex, I had thought that our promise would take priority.</p><br/><p>When I stared at her, Lee Songha nervously said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry, oppa. But the director\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe director?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked at the production team, Director Woo was replaying the filmed scene while talking with the production staff and assistant director.</p><br/><p>Soon, Director Woo jolted up from his seat and came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, your reactions were amazing. We were able to clearly capture your surprised and flustered reactions. See, I told you that you only needed to react. If you knew you\u2019d be splashed with alcohol, you wouldn\u2019t have made such an expression.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>So Director Woo ordered her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for giving you this role after asking you to make a cameo appearance. Ms. Chaeyoung\u2019s presence is too big that I thought we needed at least this much action for Mr. Songha to win their power struggle. Since everyone at home knows your relationship with Ms. Songha, the scene will also be comedic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. As long as you got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>And here I thought Lee Songha couldn\u2019t control her instincts and threw it at me.</p><br/><p>I was going to tell Lee Songha that she did a good job before pausing.</p><br/><p>If the scene came out great, why was it NG?</p><br/><p>Before I could ask, Director Woo said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Chaeyoung, your actions and ad-libbed lines were all great. There\u2019s nothing more to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s lips curled up slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is Ms. Songha. I don\u2019t think we can use any bust shots of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes unconsciously widened.</p><br/><p>It was NG because of Lee Songha? They wouldn\u2019t be able to use a single cut?</p><br/><p>Director Woo frowned as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour gaze was great for the previous scene, but this time, the tension in the air crumbled. It was clearly obvious you were hesitant when splashing the cocktail on him. Why are you like this suddenly? Is it your first time in a scene like this? Is it difficult to splash a cocktail on someone you\u2019re close to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it was my mistake. I flinched without knowing\u2026 I\u2019ll do it properly this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha replied while biting on her lower lip.</p><br/><p>Director Woo nodded and place his hand on my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung\u2019s reaction was perfect, but since there\u2019s a three shot and an angle where a camera is filming over your shoulder, you are always in the frame. Would you mind doing it again\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded at the apologetic Director Woo.</p><br/><p>I had already been worried that Lee Songha didn\u2019t feel as realistic as Son Chaeyoung, who was only making a cameo appearance. If the mood changes from this scene, if it makes the viewers look at Lee Songha more than Son Chaeyoung, then why not?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s refreshing and nice. It\u2019s tasty too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Other actors in dramas were hit with kimchi, flour, and stuff, so cocktails weren\u2019t so bad. When I said this while licking my lower lip, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s eyes narrowed. Then she revealed a crooked smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like this? Then should I ask her to throw a cake at you next time? That feels much worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m satisfied with just watching\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I trailed off mid-reply.</p><br/><p>A few steps away, Lee Songha was constantly conscious of us.</p><br/><p>She was burning to know what we were talking about. Although it was the director\u2019s order, she felt sorry and guilty for splashing a cocktail on my face and for getting a NG. Which was why she felt she couldn\u2019t join in our conversation.</p><br/><p>These were probably her thoughts right now.</p><br/><p>I decided now wasn\u2019t the time to leave her in that state and talk to Son Chaeyoung so I immediately went over to her. Then I comforted Lee Songha, who was feeling down from the NG.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, don\u2019t worry about the NG. Just do it without worrying about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, oppa. I\u2019ll do it perfectly this time. There won\u2019t be a third time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said resolutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cNG!\u201d</p><br/><p>Again?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was taken aback with a flustered face, but Director Woo immediately shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain! And, cue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung tightly grasped my arm and dragged me over.</p><br/><p>This time, I observed Lee Songha\u2019s expression without a care for the cocktail flying at my face.</p><br/><p>I understood why the scene was no good.</p><br/><p>While acting, Lee Songha seemed to embody her role to the point it was worrisome, but this wasn\u2019t the case right now. The one who stood rigidly while holding an empty cocktail glass wasn\u2019t the audacious top star Lee Sohee.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the celebrity Lee Songha who people mistook for being cold and unapproachable.</p><br/><p>She was the Lee Songha that I knew.</p><br/><p>The Lee Songha who held my sleeve and slightly pulled on it and rustled in the passenger seat while handing me jellies or chips.</p><br/><p>That was why the scene was no good.</p><br/><p>Multiple takes all resulted in NGs while I was thinking about what to do.</p><br/><p>Cocktails splashed on my face that many times, and Lee Songha firmly embedded herself into a state of disorder. At first, she didn\u2019t know why the scenes were no good, but after checking the scene on the monitor with the director, she looked even more surprised.</p><br/><p>If I excluded the time she was flustered and forgot all her lines, she never had such a hard time with acting. It seemed she herself was frustrated and nervous that she couldn\u2019t act the way she wanted to as she was at a loss at what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I do this? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>While the next cocktail was being prepared, Lee Songha poured water into the used, empty cocktail glasses and threw their contents in a frenzy. She returned to her role quite a bit. The snap in her wrist was also relentless.</p><br/><p>The problem was that she relapsed when the shoot began.</p><br/><p>It seemed she couldn\u2019t immerse herself in her role because of me, should I talk to Director Woo again? But that man\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look great. Don\u2019t tell me the entire scene would be cut?</p><br/><p>I thought about it while drying my hair with a towel when I heard the staff members whispering behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is she like that? Apparently, she almost never made any NGs when filming Cat Guardian Ghost? Was it because she never had to adlib and strictly followed the script?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you not to listen to those \u2018apparently\u2019s. Ms. Son Chaeyoung and the manager are the ones suffering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPutting the manager aside, I bet she\u2019s nervous about Ms. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s mood. How many times did she mess up in the exact spot of the scene with her great sunbae? It\u2019s great that she isn\u2019t pissed. This is worse than the scene with Ms. Seo Eunkyo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? If this continues, will Ms. Lee Songha have a mental breakdown?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this scene is cut. We are using an incredibly expensive film to make the footage pop since it\u2019s our first scene and there\u2019s a cameo appearance. We\u2019re just burning money like we\u2019re throwing out cocktails.\u201d</p><br/><p>I glanced at Director Woo. He was scratching his sideburns as his eyes were glued to the screen while shaking his head intermittently. He looked like someone who expected something spectacular but suffered a total loss.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Seo Eunkyo looked like she was enjoying this situation.</p><br/><p>Previously, she looked like she was about to dig her own grave and lie in it because of what happened with Son Chaeyoung and how she messed up the first shoot, but now, she was lying on a sunbed, drinking cocktails jubilantly.</p><br/><p>She was glancing at Lee Songha while whispering to her manager, but it was obvious what they were talking about. They were probably hoping that Lee Songha messed this shoot up so that her scenes would decrease and that she would leave a bad impression on the director and Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>If that happened, they would be joyfully toasting with their cocktails.</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it made my insides twist.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I approached her, she flinched in surprise like a guilty person.</p><br/><p>I looked around before saying in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel so pressured. It\u2019s normal for a rookie actress to mess up. You\u2019re just making mistakes because there are a lot of spontaneous parts to this shoot. That\u2019s why you should just relax and remember how you calmed read Lee Sohee\u2019s lines during practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry, oppa. You\u2019re soaked because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Getting splashed with cocktails isn\u2019t bad once in your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already your fifth time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I feel like a lead in a drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got splashed five times because of me and got grabbed five times\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha mumbled in a gloomy voice as she stared at Son Chaeyoung. She was oddly quiet. I thought that, like Seo Eunkyo, Son Chaeyoung would be beyond irritated and personally attack Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>She was simply looked at us with crossed arms.</p><br/><p>I took my eyes off Son Chaeyoung and lowered my voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you still can\u2019t get into the role, think that you\u2019re splashing Son Chaeyoung instead of me. You said that your hands felt empty. You remember when you threw a cake and a snowman\u2019s head at her, right? Recall the rage you felt back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRage\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Narrowing her eyes, Lee Songha snatched and downed the other cocktail on the pool bar in an instant. She brought the glass down with a thud. Then, with clenched fists, she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I can do it properly this time. I got a feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, Director Woo approached us with a frowning face and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our last take. If it\u2019s no good this time as well, we\u2019re moving onto the next scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was our last chance.</p><br/><p>People who heard Director Woo\u2019s words murmured. They seemed interested in whether this final take would be okay or end up as a NG again.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo looked like she needed popcorn.</p><br/><p>Damn it. Let\u2019s not look in her direction since it angers me.</p><br/><p>Anyways, everyone was watching us. If the take resulted in a NG again, then her image as a talented rookie actress she gained while filming Cat Guardian Ghost would be tossed away. Also, the events of today would follow her around throughout the shoot.</p><br/><p>I swallowed dryly and looked at Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand,\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA cameo appearance is an appearance, but I\u2019m doing this because my screen time might be cut out completely because of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, she steadfastly walked to Lee Songha. Then she whispered something in her ear.</p><br/><p>What was she whispering about?</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t hear anything even though I perked my ears.</p><br/><p>The surrounding gazes began to lock on them. Although there were quite a few people who were trying to act like they were coming closer and perking their ears, since I, who was closer, couldn\u2019t hear it, they obviously couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Their secret conversation ended quickly.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung casually returned next to me, and Lee Songha stood rigidly with a tight grip on a newly made cocktail I couldn\u2019t clearly see her expression because her head was slightly lowered.</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to ask Son Chaeyoung what she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our last take! And, cue!\u201d</p><br/><p>The murmurs quieted down immediately, and Lee Songha swiftly raised her head.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s it!</p><br/><p>I inwardly yelled in delight when I saw her expression.</p><br/><p>Her chilling face that seemed to have frosted over. However, her eyes were burning in fury.</p><br/><p>A \u2018Lee Sohee-like\u2019 gaze. She looked like she could kill.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what she said to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung pulled my arm while saying in an irritated voice.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lee Songha swung the cocktail glass without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Her emotions looked good! The snap of her wrist was good too! So was her spirit!</p><br/><p>I confirmed as a lemon wedge slapped my cheek.</p><br/><p>This was, without a doubt, a good take.</p><br/><p>That moment, Lee Songha forcefully pushed me aside. Then she suddenly grabbed two cocktail glasses in each hand and swung them.</p><br/><p>Without me as a shield, Son Chaeyoung was completely soaked by her attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, are you crazy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha didn\u2019t seem to even hear her as she threw away the empty glasses. Then she reloaded with new ones. Madness lingered in her eyes. It was to the point where I was confused whether she was holding cocktail glasses or Molotov Cocktails.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough! Do you to fight right here and now? Is that it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hear Son Chaeyoung grind her teeth.</p><br/><p>Then, with a dazzling smile, Lee Songha replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof, woof.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pushed aside, I blankly watched the scene in front of me.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung grabbed Lee Songha\u2019s hair first, and Lee Songha immediately grabbed Son Chaeyoung\u2019s head with both hands. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s yells and Lee Songha\u2019s barks mixed together and rang throughout the swimming pool.</p><br/><p>Fighting in close quarters, the two splashed into the pool.</p><br/><p>People hastily retreated from this disaster.</p><br/><p>The quiet pool had, in mere moments, devolved into a mess.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, I suddenly recalled what Director Woo said before.</p><br/><p>He said he wanted to see a \u2018I\u2019m the craziest bitch in this industry\u2019 attitude.</p><br/><p>There it was.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Director Woo\u2019s butt heaved up and down.</p><br/><p>His beard that ran down his sideburns to his chin trembled. His eyes, which were as wide as brass bells, and his thick hands holding a rolled up filming script were shaking. He observed the screen with excitement.</p><br/><p>Most drama writers hoped for their characters to jump off the script.</p><br/><p>And directors hoped for acting that exceeded their own directions.</p><br/><p>In front of him right was a heated performance that exceeded his expectations.</p><br/><p>Director Woo wasn\u2019t the only one who was surprised.</p><br/><p>The production, directing, camera, lights, and audio staff were all hypnotized by the fight in the pool.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo, who had hoped for Lee Songha\u2019s terrible performance, couldn\u2019t close her agape mouth, and the spectators, who were in an uproar to take pictures while avoiding the security guards\u2019 gazes, stood stiff, only moving their eyes.</p><br/><p>A Well-Made Production employee broke the silence and admired,</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Goddamn! Their energy is amazin-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Woo raised his hand and cut him off.</p><br/><p>Then he began quickly ordering the staff.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe keep rolling! Have the jib camera chase them and get a full shot! Boom mic! Audio director, we\u2019re going to use all their adlibbed lines so try to preserve as many as possible. If we leave it for post recording, it\u2019ll kill this amazing scene!\u201d</p><br/><p>The audio director checked that the boom mic was above the pool and gave him a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to preserve almost all of it. The two actresses are no joke. They are saying some aggressive adlibbed lines without rest, yet their pronunciation is clear and steady so your ears pick them up easily!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Woo licked his dry lips and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cGet one camera on Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s reaction. His reaction is great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, a camera got a closeup of his face.</p><br/><p>With a face full of confusion and amazement, Jung Sunwoo was looking into the pool that was splashing about. His expression was clearly recorded by the camera.</p><br/><p>A staff member, who had been staring at the various closely arranged screens, pressed her chest and whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my. Even as a spectator, I can\u2019t help but hold my breath. Even if we consider Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s reaction as real, Ms. Son Chaeyoung and Ms. Lee Songha are incredible. So realistic and lively! It feels more realistic than a real fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConsider yourself lucky. Do you think it\u2019s easy to see a something like this? An adlib scene like this is rare even in the movie business. They looked possessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir cooperation is amazingly good. You might even doubt this is all adlibbed and think they\u2019ve rehearsed it a hundred times. I bet no one would believe that this was all adlibbed even if we showed them the tapes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, even their pronunciation is precise. That means they are thinking about how they should deliver lines in this situation, just amazing. How could they improvise something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why they are actresses, man. That\u2019s why they are professionals.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two actresses\u2019 performance didn\u2019t end even as the faces of everyone gathered in the swimming pool flushed with excitement and their mouths were dry from admiration.</p><br/><p>Just then, Director Woo\u2019s signal rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! Cut!\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-125\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 125\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-127\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 127\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201365\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

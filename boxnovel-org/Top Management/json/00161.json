Her eyes moved quickly under her lashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSue? Did you ask if we\u2019ve ever been sued?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, whether it\u2019s for defamation or damages.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever. And we never did anything to warrant it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo placed both his arms on the table. His hands slowly clasped together under his rolled-up dress shirt sleeves. Park Hyojin unconsciously leaned back. She somehow felt like her neck was held between his two hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, looking at it, it seems like an accident like that could occur.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo said with an unpleasant expression.</p><br/><p>His still gentle voice no longer seemed so gentle.</p><br/><p>Having understood the situation, Yoon Bora made an innocent expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid your company talk about making a media play?\u201d</p><br/><p>They coughed. This time, it really felt like they were suffocating.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>So they did.</p><br/><p>I took a sip of my peppermint tea as I observed them. Although I didn\u2019t say much, their eyes were trembling, and their breaths became rough. Especially Yoon Bora, it looked like she would need a respirator.</p><br/><p>If someone else saw this situation, they would think that I made them sign a slave contract and was selling them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 They did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe chief said that doing an interview would be a good chance at getting our names out there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said it was only a media play to win over the public\u2019s sympathy. C-can we still be sued?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora asked with a frightened expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem if it\u2019s a normal interview. Of course, there wouldn\u2019t be. But if you try too hard and say something you shouldn\u2019t, then that\u2019ll be a problem. Like if you mentioned investors or drinking parties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe-we won\u2019t say things like that. We aren\u2019t planning on saying anything bad. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora jumped up and down as she shook her head.</p><br/><p>Was this an act or not?</p><br/><p>What were they thinking when they mentioned it to a program writer?</p><br/><p>Was it part of a cunning, elaborate plan? Or something they said without thinking? If not, they might have let it slip, and the writer could have thought she hit jackpot and put it in the show.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think NK Entertainment would force them to talk about the drinking parties if they were really just trying to garner sympathy as they said. If they intentionally tried to pick a fight with W&amp;U, they would lose more than they would benefit.</p><br/><p>Were these two cunning or stupid?</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>The incident happened because of that interview and being stupid didn\u2019t clear you of your crimes.</p><br/><p>Although I told Chief Lee Taeshin that it was for the worst-case scenario, I had planned to lock their mouths up from the beginning. I still hadn\u2019t fully recovered from my distrust in humanity caused by the traitor.</p><br/><p>This was a problem of whether a person lived or died. There was no need to leave any room for uncertainty.</p><br/><p>Well, there would be a difference in whether I used polite words or threatening ones.</p><br/><p>I gently smiled and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s a relief. I was worried because I had heard rumors that NK Entertainment was planning on doing something like that as noise marketing. It seems the rumor was exaggerated. You must have been shocked when I suddenly brought up suing you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s okay. I was a bit shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said something like that? The person must really hate us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. We will never do something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, no need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora and Park Hyojin confirmed.</p><br/><p>Then the same voices rang in my ear.</p><br/><p>-Tell them to sue us.</p><br/><p>-Hyojin!</p><br/><p>-People are flooding us with sympathy so it\u2019ll be great for us if you sue. People will take even more pity on us. They\u2019ll say that a big company like W&amp;U is bullying powerless people like us.</p><br/><p>-We\u2019ll just pay.</p><br/><p>What kind of crazy\u2026</p><br/><p>Their conversation was so absurd that I belatedly realized that I was in the future. Although there was a bit of static, it wasn\u2019t so bad that I couldn\u2019t distinguish their voices. Yoon Bora, Park Hyojin, and Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s voice played from the earphone in my ear.</p><br/><p>The jack was plugged into my phone. Was this an audio recording?</p><br/><p>For a while, all I could hear was Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s distressed pants. He seemed to be having trouble breathing as it became more ragged.</p><br/><p>-How can\u2026 How can you still\u2026 How could you do this to Jae?!</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s not like we said her name. It\u2019s the netizens who looked into it.</p><br/><p>-We are powerless, so we have to find a way to be famous. Jae unni has a lot of people helping her. She even has you. W&amp;U is going to respond and cover the whole thing up since it\u2019s not like she really did do any sexual favors.</p><br/><p>It felt like someone popped my head open and poured ice into it. My brain froze.</p><br/><p>My future self took the earphones out and turned his gaze. Lee Kwanwoo was sitting next to me. He had a very serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cKwanwoo, I\u2019ll send this file to Team Leader Park, so you go stay with the PR Team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Where will you be going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty Girls\u2019 residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere probably won\u2019t be anything. There are a lot of people looking after Jung Jae right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>So we did find her. Jung Jae.</p><br/><p>As I patted my chest in relief, my phone rang. It was Oh Yeondu of Pretty Girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ch-chief, chief. Jae unni. Jae unni.</p><br/><p>Her voice creaked with fear. I also heard people crying and screaming.</p><br/><p>I had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>Someone took the phone from Oh Yeondu.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m Lee Suji. Jae just sli-slit her wrist!</p><br/><p>I returned to the present.</p><br/><p>Damn it. I downed the peppermint tea in an instant. Thinking about the future I saw before and the one just now left a bad feeling. It felt like my entire body was frozen. I licked my dry lips when a glass of water slid towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease have some water if you\u2019re thirsty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we ask for the menu again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin and Yoon Bora asked in front of me.</p><br/><p>Their voices were pleasant, unlike the cold voices I heard just before.</p><br/><p>I laughed. I used human words all this time for nothing.</p><br/><p>When my foe were animals.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome trash might try to talk or push you into doing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019Our previous company took a member to a drinking party with investors. We left because we didn\u2019t want to do something like that.\u2019 If you say something like that, it\u2019ll definitely be a hot topic and the public will sympathize with you. Even if W&amp;U sues you, you could consider it as an opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taken aback, they exchanged glances with each other. Yoon Bora gulped a couple time. Were her cunning desires fanning the flames right now?</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin was the first to return to her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, we said that something like that will not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only saying this so that you remember my words if you are ever faced with a decision like this. If you make the wrong decision and this project fails, we\u2019ll be taking very aggressive measures. Our PR Team will make you out to be complete bitches in the public\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I leaned forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to continue as a celebrity, no, even have a social life when it gets out that you pretended not to know that a member was being dragged to drinking parties since you thought you could become famous if she was able to nab a sponsor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their faces paled like they had been dunked in water a few times.</p><br/><p>After shifting her eyes back and forth, Yoon Bora asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cW-who said that? Was it Chief Lee? D-does he have any proof?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora flinched at my smile.</p><br/><p>Of course, we didn\u2019t have any proof. But, thinking like that, there was also no proof that Jung Jae went to drinking parties either. In a dirty fight chipping away at each other\u2019s image, the victor would be decided by whose PR Team was more skilled and well connected.</p><br/><p>Their faces gradually paled after every word I spoke.</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin, who seemed to be wracking her brain, looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really won\u2019t do anything like that, so don\u2019t scare us like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It seems like you\u2019re threatening us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora pouted, looking like she was about to cry.</p><br/><p>I carefully examined their expression. Then a smile hung on my lips again.</p><br/><p>In a voice that was as friendly as possible, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you like this, but this could be a very serious problem. All sorts of things happen in this industry. Although I think that the rumors I heard were nonsense, I thought it would be good to confirm with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They smile awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Just as the tense mood seemed to relax a little, Yoon Bora, who had been carefully reading my expression, couldn\u2019t hold her words back any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, chief. Is there really no way we can rejoin Pretty Girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>There could be a way. Perhaps.</p><br/><p>If things went as expected, we would have asked them to appear on Making Film. If they had sincerely supported the other members like Chief Lee Taeshin said they would, then Producer Yoo Sooyoung would have packaged it into a warm, heartrending story.</p><br/><p>Then, the viewers might take pity on the dispersed Pretty Girls members, and their opinion that the Pretty Girls should be whole again could get large enough that NK Entertainment couldn\u2019t ignore it.</p><br/><p>If things played out that way, then perhaps.</p><br/><p>A deal that benefited both NK Entertainment and me could have been made.</p><br/><p>Maybe, but that would never happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead, I looked into NK Entertainment\u2019s group a little. The one you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two who were visibly disappointed quickly raised their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it was alright. I think the group\u2019s image matches you better than Pretty Girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>The more I spoke, the more their faces swelled with anticipation.</p><br/><p>In a voice filled with certainty, I hammered in the final nail.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll do well there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRe-really?\u201d</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>Just empty drivel.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>After finishing things up, I went to find Chief Lee Taeshin. He was looking for Jung Jae in Yeouido with a cameraman. I picked them up, and as soon as they got in the minivan, Chief Lee Taeshin cautiously asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did the meeting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about that later. Do you happen to know Lee Suji\u2019s number?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Suji?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin asked back, confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who left Pretty Girls with Kang Suran. Ah, there isn\u2019t someone else named Lee Suji that Jung Jae knows, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s probably right. But I already called her multiple times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>I entered her address and began to drive as he tried to call her.</p><br/><p>The future I saw back then kept floating around in my mind. The last person who talked about Jung Jae definitely called herself Lee Suji. I heard she completely left the entertainment world after leaving Pretty Girls. Did they say she was a university student now?</p><br/><p>It felt odd that she was at Pretty Girls\u2019 residence for some reason.</p><br/><p>Although she could have come over because she was worried about Jung Jae with all the bad press, it was better to be safe. I also didn\u2019t have any other hints to go off on.</p><br/><p>We soon arrived at Lee Suji\u2019s home in Mapo. Having called ahead, Lee Suji was waiting for us on the street. Even from afar, I could see the concern on her pretty face.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin almost rolled out the minivan and asked her about Jung Jae\u2019s whereabouts. Lee Suji shook her head with a troubled look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t hear from her? I\u2019m just really worried about her, Suji. If you know anything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, of course, I\u2019ll contact you. Last time, last last time, and even before that, I told you that it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve heard from Jae. You said that she hasn\u2019t gone missing and even called her parents. You don\u2019t need to wo-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>I cut in.</p><br/><p>It seemed she recognized my face as Lee Suji looked shocked like she had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lee Taeshin might be sued at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that we are preparing for Making Film, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to start recording and practicing choreography, but Pretty Girls and Chief Lee Taeshin stubbornly said they were going to wait for Ms. Jung Jae and are wasting time. We are already way behind schedule. The broadcast might completely fall through.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Suji was so shocked that she didn\u2019t know what to do, but even Chief Lee Taeshin and the cameraman were at a loss for words. I waved my hand and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already started filming a few scenes, and if we are met with a lawsuit asking for compensation, Chief Lee Taeshin might be fully responsible. Chief Lee is already in debt, and at this rate, he could actually go to prison. I think Ms. Jung Jae should know about this situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took a step closer and asked again,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really not know where she is?\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-160\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 160\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-162\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 162\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201434\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Producer Choi recalled the conversation he had ten minutes Chief Jung Sunwoo arrived.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you sure it\u2019s okay to push him? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s some minor company but W&amp;U. Also, you know Chief Jung Sunwoo.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you so cautious around some budding seedling as a network producer? Large management companies are taking on bad habits because of guys like you. They think they\u2019re the best since we treat their top stars well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What if they take the reality TV show elsewhere because they are offended? This proposal is good.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018There are two Neptune members on your show. We can just put a little pressure on him saying that they could be taken off the show.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Will that work?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll have to. I\u2019m doing this for you, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019ll be the one to pressure him, so you just play up to him from the side. There\u2019s a ton we can gain from him. We need to take every last bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>At first, Producer Choi felt skeptical, but he slowly began to think General Manager Hwang\u2019s words had some truth to them.</p><br/><p>If things work out and W&amp;U actors will appear on his show and if he could properly utilize Jung Sunwoo, who the general public had an eye on\u2026 This was something he couldn\u2019t pass when he was worried he might be changed out from the program as he awaited the spring restructuring.</p><br/><p>Just as his small hope grew, Jung Sunwoo spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was calm despite having been looked down upon.</p><br/><p>\u201cSponsored idol reality shows are trying to do business with their fans, but our situation is a bit different, is it not? This will be a hot topic. It\u2019ll get ads, and you might be able to sell the rights as Chinese demand increases with Lee Songha\u2019s appearance on the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it still a three or four-part series? There needs to be a bit more of a benefit for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, are we asking for a lot? In exchange for giving you a good timeslot and setting you up with a good director and writers, all we want is W&amp;U\u2019s wholehearted support. I\u2019m simply suggesting we help each other out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to help each other out. But we can\u2019t order our top stars around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo made a difficult expression.</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang, who acted like he was upset, changed his tone,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about those at a lower level? Who\u2019s that actor, the one who\u2019s in the news a lot? Nam Joyoon? What if him and you come on the show and share your story? Wouldn\u2019t it benefit him as well if we promote him like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. It\u2019ll be beneficial, but we are carefully deliberating his entertainment show appearances. It\u2019s a very important time for him right now, and he\u2019s not a skilled talker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow really. Then let\u2019s have Neptune\u2019s comeback performance on our network? They are preparing an album, right? Since you did it on PBS last time, you should do it on our network.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Jung Sunwoo could reply, General Manager Hwang cut him off and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it carefully. Chief Jung, if you keep saying that you can\u2019t do this and that, then we\u2019ll get upset. Internally, people have brought up switching out Im Seoyoung and LJ, and if our relationship with W&amp;U sours, that might actually happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, general manager. Why would you bring that up here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Choi quickly joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung and LJ are part of our family. It\u2019s our fault that they aren\u2019t trendy enough. Why do you keep bringing up hard-working cast members?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because it feels like we\u2019re the only ones who think of them like family!\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang clicked his tongue then left the room saying he had to make a call.</p><br/><p>Producer Choi placed his hand on Jung Sunwoo\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t say anything because he\u2019s our chief producer. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo turned to look at him. Producer Choi swallowed dryly as he examined Jung Sunwoo\u2019s expression. He had thought he would either be at a loss at what to do or mad at the general manager\u2019s intimidation. He thought it would be one of the two\u2026</p><br/><p>But it was neither.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit taken aback. Can we consider this as IBC\u2019s official stance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot mine, but it\u2019s the general manager\u2019s stance. You know how the higher-ups think. I\u2019ll try talking with the general manager again so please help me out. Please think of it as helping Seoyoung and LJ out. Of course, we\u2019ll push the reality\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Choi examined his expression again as he tried to persuade him.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo had a thick smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Lee Kwanwoo, correct? Neptune\u2019s road manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo, who was glancing at the meeting room, stood up. The man who approached him had an IBC employee card around his neck. He introduced himself as a drama director before handing him a warm cup of coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Chief Jung Sunwoo came to the entertainment department. Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are in a meeting right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh wow. I came right over when I heard the news. It\u2019s been difficult to meet with him to discuss any projects. Does our Chief Jung like coffee or juice?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director asked while holding a can of coffee and juice in either hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I know, he drinks coffee more often.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what is the meeting about? He needs to be in a good mood so that I can strike a conversation with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo was sidestepping the conversation when Jung Sunwoo walked out of the meeting room.</p><br/><p>The director beamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know what they talked about, but I guess things went well? He\u2019s smiling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo mumbled.</p><br/><p>The director quickly headed over and handed him the can of coffee and a script.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung! This, I talked to you about it on the phone before. This will be a huge success.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t received a timeslot because we haven\u2019t confirmed the leads, but if Ms. Lee Songha says she\u2019ll do it, we\u2019ll get a timeslot immediately. It\u2019s also time for Ms. Songha to be a sole lead! Don\u2019t go anywhere and work with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, we\u2019ll have to see the schedule for any new projects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe match your schedule! Call me once you\u2019ve read the script, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll let you know first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind the wistful drama director, he left the building with steadfast steps.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo followed behind and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess the meeting didn\u2019t go well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think that? I\u2019m smiling, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo laughed.</p><br/><p>Taking a step back, Lee Kwanwoo scratched his neck, which had broken out in goosebumps.</p><br/><p>Greeting people as he passed by, Jung Sunwoo said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been looked down upon like this. It\u2019s refreshing. I feel two years younger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Did they say they won\u2019t do the show?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they said they want to, but they want too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to live together, but if we want to live with them, we need to buy the house, appliances, furniture, and a car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Understanding what went on in the meeting, Lee Kwanwoo frowned. The battle of wits between broadcasting and management companies. And the tyranny of network producers who held the timeslots. This wasn\u2019t surprising.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>All traces of a smile disappeared from Jung Sunwoo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>I left Lee Kwanwoo to go back to the company before heading to Neptune\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>I opened the door and went in. Lee Taehee was standing by the entrance.</p><br/><p>It was usually Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee gestured with her chin as though she read my mind. Lee Songha was sleeping, flopped on the sofa. She had an interview early yesterday morning as well. She has been so busy that it felt like I\u2019ve only seen her eat or sleep when she wasn\u2019t working.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the other girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think they are sleeping? They haven\u2019t left their rooms, saying that it was going to rain since the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRice wine is best for rainy days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee licked her lips before continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cI was working on songs while having a drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you tell the others about your songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I plan on telling them once it\u2019s decided.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she smiled faintly. It suited her.</p><br/><p>She was always like this while she was waiting for my reply. She was always calm and quiet.</p><br/><p>However, when I told her that Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader danced when they heard her songs\u2026 When I said sorry for the late reply and laughed as I told her she might be a genius\u2026</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee\u2019s relieved expression was completely different from normal.</p><br/><p>Although she acted like nothing was wrong, she must have a lot on her mind. Also, this probably wasn\u2019t limited to Lee Taehee. It was the same for Lee Songha, who was becoming more famous by the day but was also gaining a lot of personal fans that negatively affected their group\u2019s fanbase. This also went for Im Seoyoung and LJ, who were appearing on entertainment shows.</p><br/><p>I wondered how much they had on their minds that they weren\u2019t telling me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa! When did you arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung burst out her room. Her hair was a mess like she had just woken up, and she had a yellow blanket wrapped around her like a cloak. Im Seoyoung\u2019s cheery voice shook their residence. Lee Songha\u2019s eyes immediately opened, and LJ yawned as she came out of her room.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Lee Songha have another schedule today? Euahh, but she looks like a complete couch-potato right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have ssamjang<sup>{1}</sup> on your chin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha hastily rubbed her chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung giggled. Then she asked me,</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, why did you come today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh, don\u2019t lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung, who shook her blanket in a playful manner, stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to see you and LJ.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking a moment to process this, Im Seoyoung and LJ blinked.</p><br/><p>We went into LJ\u2019s room. Im Seoyoung\u2019s room had no space due to all her stuffed animals.</p><br/><p>This room was filled with exercising equipment and gaming gear. Thick books in their original language were neatly organized on her desk. I couldn\u2019t tell what they were about as their covers had pictures of shackles or handcuffs on them.</p><br/><p>We took our places on the chair, bed, and floor when the door creaked open.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, do you want coffee?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha leaned her head out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe also have citron tea, ginseng extract, and tomato juice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have stuff like that in our fridge? Why didn\u2019t I see them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung\u2019s eyes widened. LJ flatly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should tell her to bring you something. It looks she\u2019s worried you\u2019ll faint from a parched throat while talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen citron tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait a moment. I\u2019ll make it right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung glared at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you not going to ask us? I\u2019m going to drink all of oppa\u2019s share.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have water and barley tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having gotten her revenge, Lee Songha soon brought over three cups.</p><br/><p>Taking a sip of citron tea, I looked at Im Seoyoung. She acted stiffly when I told her I wanted to talk, but she now returned to normal thanks to Lee Songha. Looking at her sipping tomato juice while holding her cup with both hands, I asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the mood on Good Friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her large eyes shook like they were struck by an earthquake.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really? It seems like they are a bit restless with the upcoming restructuring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ said.</p><br/><p>Surprised, Im Seoyoung couldn\u2019t even shout before slapping LJ\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? It doesn\u2019t matter if we talk about it now. He\u2019s already decided to appear on the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to discuss this once anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at me. LJ downed her bottle of water in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe staff kept going around asking us to get you to appear on the show. They only asked me, but it seems they pestered her because she seemed like a pushover. Especially the producer. He asked why we couldn\u2019t ask our manager to do this and commented about how we didn\u2019t have any affection for the program.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Choi Byungsoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ nodded before adding,</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, stop it! It\u2019s so embarrassing! What are you going to say now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung was nervous as she bounced up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I stop?\u201d</p><br/><p>I handed her my citron tea and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, tell me everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Rain sprinkled on my windshield. The white streetlights\u2019 light diffused through the rain. Sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, I quietly observed at the scene. The incident at the broadcasting company and LJ\u2019s words rang in my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice broke the silence. Chief Lee Taeshin got in the passenger\u2019s seat. He seemed to have rushed over without an umbrella as his hair was wet.</p><br/><p>He clenched his fist once before lowering his head. His expression became gloomy like a cloudy night sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t found Jae yet. She hasn\u2019t contacted her home. She came to the city during high school with the dream of becoming a singer, so she probably doesn\u2019t have any friends to spend the night at. The other girls signed with another company, but I have no idea where she disappeared off to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, he examined my expression.</p><br/><p>It seemed he was worried I would tell him to stop looking for Jung Jae.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m constantly looking around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess she might contact you once the article is published.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe article?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin quickly looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, please let the goldfish, I mean, members know that they can tell their family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of my lips rose as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to start.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Korean sauce usually used for Korean BBQ</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-153\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 153\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-155\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 155\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201420\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

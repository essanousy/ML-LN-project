A frightening rise!}</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plastered on the newspaper columns again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a drama with 20% ratings for a while now. The drama department is excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>PBS\u2019s cafeteria.</p><br/><p>The broadcasting team employees walked while continuing to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe entertainment department is making a fuss, telling us to get the Royal Family cast to appear on our show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen our program probably won\u2019t even be able to bring it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhohoh, isn\u2019t that Chief Jung Sunwoo? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest writer pointed to the other side. It seemed like they had just finished eating as two men were walking towards them whilst having a friendly conversation. One was the chief producer of the drama department while the other was Chief Jung, who came up quite a bit in the news.</p><br/><p>The second writer poked the producer\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer! Lee Songha, get us Lee Songha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, just call them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer shirked away, but the writers pushed his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were already rejected a hundred times on the phone! They might make an exception for you! The entertainment producers help their programs with casting through their connections!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that you did a program with Neptune when they were still unknown!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung Sunwoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second writer quickly raised her hand.</p><br/><p>Seeing him personally, Chief Jung Sunwoo seemed quite gentle despite his outer appearance.</p><br/><p>However, he was quick to refuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We don\u2019t even have enough time to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, our international star Lee Songha is busy these days!\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief producer patted Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, we heard you work on a program with our producer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jung Sunwoo stared at the producer.</p><br/><p>The producer\u2019s eyes trembled like there was an earthquake like he had something to hide.</p><br/><p>Soon, Chief Jung Sunwoo opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did. It\u2019s been a while, producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Chief Jung. I\u2019m sorry about the past. That time, there was so much rain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Even though we were cut from the live broadcast, the video of them rehearsing in the rain and Songha falling helped improve their image.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood became strange. Including the chief producer and the second writer, the broadcasting team employees simply blinked as they listened to their conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, th-that\u2019s right? In the end, it was helpful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer stated awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe concept we\u2019re preparing is \u2018International Stars\u2019. It\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we are simply too busy right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jung Sunwoo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cA day, no, can\u2019t you even make room for half a day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There are schedules that were set months ago so we can\u2019t change them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, if you\u2019re upset about what happened\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still smiling, Chief Jung Sunwoo waved his hand and said goodbye before walking away. His refusal was without fault, but it left a strange icky feeling. The chief producer clicked his tongue and walked away with him.</p><br/><p>The writers whispered quietly next to the red-faced producer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one you both worked on was that campaign broadcast? The one where Neptune overexerted themselves in the rain and that was criticized as the broadcasting company abusing their power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have rejected if I was Chief Jung as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer kicked the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was all humble back when he was a road manager, yet he\u2019s changed because he\u2019s some bigshot now, huh?! He\u2019s so full of himself because everything he does ends up in a success. Someone like him needs to fail horribly one day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person\u2019s next project was Royal Family. The one with 20% ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the second writer gave him a pitying look, the producer shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that movie! I hope that flops horribly!\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Yeongdeungpo MA Cinema.</p><br/><p>It was bustling with photographers, cameramen, and security guards in front of the VIP screening photo wall. A commotion even louder than when other celebrities passed by broke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, uh, the cast of Royal Family have arrived! Yoon Taekyung and Im Joowon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly Seo Eunkyo isn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fingers were already rapidly tapping on their laptops. Articles went up within minutes.</p><br/><p>{Even during this busy time, the \u2018Royal Family\u2019 cast shows their loyalty, but where is Seo Eunkyo?}</p><br/><p>The photographers continued to press the shutter even after the two men had left the photo wall. Chief Jung Sunwoo, who came out to greet them, led them into the theatre.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait! Could we get a 5-minute-!\u201d</p><br/><p>An entertainment reporter, who rushed with his press card stretched out, was bounced away by a security guard. Other reporters, who were half-worried, half-expectant that the reporter got an exclusive interview, turned their gazes.</p><br/><p>Soon, Jung Sunwoo\u2019s picture was framed on the portal site.</p><br/><p>{Whatever he picks is a success? Chief Jung Sunwoo of W&amp;U, is it \u2018luck or skill\u2019?}</p><br/><p>{When will Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s divine choices end? Showdown at \u2018Alive\u2019}</p><br/><p>\u201cI think there\u2019ll be a ton of newsworthy stuff if we get close to Chief Jung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe used to come out to get-togethers in the past, but he doesn\u2019t show up anymore? Why is it harder to have a couple drink with a chief than a director?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it? Park Woojeong of G-Today? Apparently, they became close while he was still a road manager and now she\u2019s hit jackpot. Why can\u2019t I have that much luck?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would have known Jung Sunwoo and Lee Songha would become this big in two years?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters sighed, consoling their regrets.</p><br/><p>While they were talking, celebrities attending the screening were posted on portal sites as if showing off Alive\u2019s large scale. Their outfits, body, makeup, and even actions were dissected and filled the entertainment column.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Neptune!\u201d</p><br/><p>Flashes erupted simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Neptune, without Lee Songha, were walking up to the photo wall. When Im Seoyoung, who had her hair done up, waved her hand, the spectators shouted like they were at a consolation performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey all came? I guess they are close?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Lee Songha\u2019s the only one who blew up, it\u2019s about time for some bad rumors to spread, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if you compare to when they were unknown two years ago, they blew up too. Lee Taehee\u2019s OST song{2} is first on the charts, and Im Seoyoung and LJ are regular members on an entertainment program and host their own radio show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard they were preparing for their next album. Will things fall apart if that fails?\u201d</p><br/><p>{All Neptune members attending the \u2018Alive\u2019 screening! Confirmed \u2018Loyalty\u2019 Idols!}</p><br/><p>{Lee Taehee, whose \u2018Royal Family\u2019 OST swept through the charts on first place, appeared for the first time in a while!}</p><br/><p>Chief Jung Sunwoo appeared again and brought them inside. The same reporter came rushing forward for an interview, but he was bounced away by the same security guard.</p><br/><p>The returning reporter huffed while saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust you wait! If the movie screening reactions aren\u2019t good, I\u2019ll write a hundred articles criticizing it!\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Once the media movie screening ended, social media, movie, and entertainment communities posted their reviews.</p><br/><p>-Finally, a \u2018not-embarrassing\u2019 Korean zombie movie appears. (Park Bumtae @3scene)</p><br/><p>-While it\u2019s a feelgood movie with tons to see, it mixed in observations of the cruel nature of human society without it going stale. Looking good! (Shin Boyoung @kor-cine)</p><br/><p>-At first, I only saw the actors rather than the background, but I became completely absorbed by the movie at some point. All the top actors on the poster are amazing. However, the scene-stealer was elsewhere. (Oh Hyunjin @film magazine)</p><br/><p>-I thought there would nothing to eat at this rumored feast, but I hope people who have the same thoughts as me would go watch it. I am fully sated. There was even something that wasn\u2019t on the menu. That was amazing. (Lee Saechul @movie adventure)</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>A large, slick van finally found a place to park.</p><br/><p>There were six people who got off the van and looked around the parking lot. Four middle-aged men and women and a man in his twenties. Finally, there was a female student with short-cut hair and a Mickey Mouse hoodie.</p><br/><p>They were Nam Joyoon\u2019s family who had come to see Alive\u2019s paid screening.</p><br/><p>The glasses-wearing middle-aged man, Nam Joyoon\u2019s father, approached the driver.</p><br/><p>\u201cDriver, thank you for bringing us all the way here. We were able to come here comfortably thanks to you, but I don\u2019t know if Joyoon paid you for your troubles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry and please enjoy the movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should watch this movie too. My son is in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I have already bought tickets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s father grinned when he heard the driver\u2019s response. His cheeks became rosy like he had a few drinks. Nam Joyoon\u2019s mother dragged him towards the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, you old man, act your age!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s good if one more person comes to see!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet people will watch even if you don\u2019t? It\u2019s the most popular one right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female student holding the elevator, Nam Joyoon\u2019s cousin, said.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are tons of internet articles about it too because famous actors are in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Joyoon have any articles?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s aunt, who was fixing her purple scarf, asked.</p><br/><p>This time, Nam Joyoon\u2019s male cousin shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot one, mom. I already checked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important. What\u2019s important is that he\u2019s appearing in such a big movie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s father said resolutely. The higher up they went, the brighter his smile became. The tip of his dress shoes tapped the floor like he was listening to music.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s mother shook her head at the sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, this old man can\u2019t contain himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been so happy besides when you go out to drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>His father kept tapping his shoes while laughing despite her scolding.</p><br/><p>His mother\u2019s cheeks were slightly flushed as well.</p><br/><p>MA Cinema was on the eighth floor. As soon as the elevator doors opened, the heat inside overwhelmed them. The smell of nutty popcorn, buttered squid, and nachos filled their noses. The theatre was bustling with hundreds of people.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s uncle looked around with a shocked face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s crazy in here. We won\u2019t be able to find each other if we get lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll theatres are like this, dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s female cousin glared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare answer your phone in the theatres! I\u2019m going to act like I don\u2019t know you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, throw your father away.\u201d</p><br/><p>They slowly walked in.</p><br/><p>Interviews at Alive\u2019s VIP screening played on the big screen on the wall. Alive\u2019s poster was displayed on the electronic ticketing system, and there was a huge display used to promote Alive.</p><br/><p>They could hear loud noises coming from the box office.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is impossible to buy Alive tickets on site, dear client.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are more than four hundred seats, yet none are available?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were completely sold out through pre-orders for this screening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say they can\u2019t. Let\u2019s just see what we came here to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I really wanted to see this. The media\u2019s reviews say that this is really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHighly reviewed movies are usually no fun anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>Each station was bustling with people trying to purchase tickets for the screening.</p><br/><p>People were chattering on while holding a few pamphlets from the display stand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a copy of the pamphlets. Look at Lee Kihwan. He\u2019s a feast for the eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have pictures of the cast. Park Saeryung and Lee Songha look so awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perking his ears, Nam Joyoon\u2019s father went to the display stand. Looking around, he grabbed an Alive pamphlet. The cover was Alive\u2019s movie poster, and inside were individual posters for the cast.</p><br/><p>Carefully examining the pamphlet, Nam Joyoon\u2019s father grabbed a couple more.</p><br/><p>Then his mother placed them in her purse.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother-in-law, why are you taking them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to take some home to commemorate this day. I want to show our family members who didn\u2019t get to come today and show other people as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>At his words, Nam Joyoon\u2019s aunt flipped through a pamphlet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish Nam Joyoon\u2019s face would at least be on it, no matter how small.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey normally only display famous actors on the poster. Hyung\u2019s not famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s male cousin shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even see him in the trailer. What is his role?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he a zombie? Maybe you couldn\u2019t recognize him because he was all dressed up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll tire my eyes out trying to look for him for two hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice was abruptly heard behind them.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon was carrying a box full of soda and popcorn with both hands.</p><br/><p>His father held his arm with a happy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you send a car for us? We could have watched it at a theatre nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say this theatre is good. And it\u2019s big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said, smiling silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, father, I\u2019m not the one who sent the car\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>His female cousin, who was distracted by other things, quickly came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, did you go to the VIP screening too? Did you see the celebrities there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have taken some pictures with them! Did you get close to Lee Kihwan or Park Saeryung on set?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so frustrating! You need to get close when you have an opportunity like this! You don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll see them again!\u201d</p><br/><p>His female cousin stomped her feet in frustration. Then she suddenly became surprised.</p><br/><p>A man wearing a black knit sweater was approaching them. He was holding a box of popcorn and soda with one hand. And for some strange reason, he was wearing sunglasses.</p><br/><p>Coming up close, he respectfully greeted them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I am Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>When his family gave him blank stares, Nam Joyoon walked next to him and introduced him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dongsaeng I work with. He\u2019s the one who sent the car. Last time, he-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he the one who gave you side dishes last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother\u2019s eyes shined. Nam Joyoon bashfully nodded.</p><br/><p>His family greeted him with eyes of puzzlement and gratefulness.</p><br/><p>Even until then, Nam Joyoon\u2019s female cousin was suspiciously staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, why are you wearing sunglasses indoors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, because people might recognize me. I\u2019ll take them off when we\u2019re inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man said with a slight smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a celebrity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would recognize you when you\u2019re not even a celebrit\u2026 Huh? Jung Sunwoo? Are you a manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>She asked as though she was going to rush over to him.</p><br/><p>The man lowered his sunglasses a bit. His cold eyes curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Oh my god!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, people might recognize me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s two cousins rushed over to Jung Sunwoo and whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you close with our oppa? Joyoon oppa, you seem like an actor now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really Lee Songha\u2019s manager? Did Lee Songha come here too?\u201dThe more of a fuss they made, the more lost the adults\u2019 expressions became.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, he\u2019s a hundred times more famous than Joyoon oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s famous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Lee Songha\u2019s manager! Why you saw him on TV!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe does seem familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s father leaned closer and examined Jung Sunwoo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Then Nam Joyoon\u2019s mother slapped him on the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you staring at him! You\u2019re making him nervous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m just surprised Joyoon has a famous dongsaeng!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot long from now, hyung will be much more famous than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo said, his lips curling upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cA hundred times more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh? Joyoon oppa has been an unknown actor for ten years now, you know? There are hundreds of people here, yet none of them recognize him.\u201d</p><br/><p>His female cousin said without a hint of expectation. Nam Joyoon\u2019s family had similar expressions. Even Nam Joyoon didn\u2019t have any reaction.

I had expected a generous reward when he tried to hand me a natural disaster of a celebrity\u2026</p><br/><p>I gulped and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I can build my team with people I want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you uphold that even if the Team 2 Leader is extremely against it?\u201d</p><br/><p>His chopsticks stopped in midair. CEO Baek Hansung looked at me.</p><br/><p>I felt like the moisture in my body was draining from me. I wet my throat with cold water. CEO Baek Hansung occasionally looked at me like I was a very young fledgling. Of course, I could look very young to him because of our twenty-year difference, but it still made my back tingle.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you have someone you want to bring from Team 2?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem interested in learning who it was and immediately said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as the person is okay with it, then I\u2019ll handle the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a short promise, but it was more effective than a long speech about asking me to trust him.</p><br/><p>I placed a piece of beef tartare in my mouth. My head spun with every chew. He said that he wouldn\u2019t just give me a team but allow me to make it with the people I wanted. Could there be any sweeter words? Who could have ever received a proposal this sweet?</p><br/><p>It was so sweet it made me dizzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Ms. Son Chaeyoung can\u2019t be persuaded no matter what, is there any disadvantage for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>So there was no risk either.</p><br/><p>All I had to bear was the fact I would have to talk to Son Chaeyoung. If I succeeded, I would obtain an opportunity not given to anyone in the company. If I didn\u2019t, it would simply be me stepping on the thorny path for a bit.</p><br/><p>I asked another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why Ms. Son Chaeyoung isn\u2019t picking her next project, is it because she is dissatisfied with the company? I heard that her previous contract renewal didn\u2019t go so smoothly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung coolly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a yearly event.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA yearly event?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce every two years, around the time of her contract renewal. There was a time where she wanted to attend New York\u2019s fashion week before signing then went to Paris, Milan, and London, not coming back for three months. The company was in an uproar.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung laughed gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems she heard that it was a way to increase her worth, but it\u2019s lasting particularly long this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>So this happened every time her contract was up for renewal?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t listen to a single word the Team 2 Leader said and seeing how she acted towards Team Leader Park, I didn\u2019t think she would change her actions even for the director. There was nothing more to say about other employees, which is probably why he wants me to try since Son Chaeyoung personally asked for me to be her manager.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid she not listen to even you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, she doesn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said with a light chuckle.</p><br/><p>So even he couldn\u2019t persuade her.</p><br/><p>I took a sip of water to refresh my mouth and mind before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll discuss this with the girls and get back to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDiscuss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, especially with Songha. This is an emotional issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t like I was becoming Son Chaeyoung\u2019s manager with this, it was still Son Chaeyoung. Neptune\u2019s public enemy. This was a completely different situation from Nam Joyoon and Pretty Girls. While the girls were one thing, I definitely needed to discuss this with Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>She acted like a hopeless puppy waiting for her owner when I returned from Nam Joyoon or Pretty Girls\u2019 schedule. I didn\u2019t know what to expect if she saw me with Son Chaeyoung without any prior discussion.</p><br/><p>It could even make the cake or snowball incident seem even cute\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, it should be fine. I already talked with Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he do?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough she won\u2019t like it, she\u2019ll understand. Since it\u2019s something I requested.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>He talked about this with Lee Songha separately? When? If something like this happened, then I, her manager, should have been told\u2026 No, since he was the CEO, there was no reason for him to have to tell me.</p><br/><p>I barely managed to swallow back the words the surged up my throat.</p><br/><p>It rubbed me the wrong way. I was uneasy when handing Nam Joyoon\u2019s schedule to Kim Hyunsup and Neptune\u2019s schedule to Lee Kwanwoo, but it was similar to when the quadruplets entered elementary school.</p><br/><p>This was unpleasant.</p><br/><p>It was like I was handing Lee Songha to someone else. It was simply CEO Baek Hansung and Lee Songha having a private conversation without my knowledge, but it felt unpleasant like a worm wriggling in my veins.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Why didn\u2019t Lee Songha say anything?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I drove more roughly than usual. Parking at their residence, I opened the back door to see the rear seats crammed with bags. Snacks and cans the girls liked were scattered here and there. I took them all and went up to the fifth floor.</p><br/><p>I opened the door after pressing the passcode.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who was waiting beside the shoe rack, called out to me. She seemed to have been catching on lost sleep from today\u2019s morning schedule as her hair was all tangled. Her eyes also showed clear signs of sleepiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a sudden schedule?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha asked while grabbing the bags from my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour expression doesn\u2019t look very good. Also, usually, you would drive into the parking lot slowly, but you came in quite quickly today\u2026 I opened the window to check if the weather was bad. I can see the parking lot entrance from my window.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her question became an excuse as she avoided my gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you have an interview, so come out when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said before looking around the living room. LJ and Im Seoyoung had been laying on the rug and were in the middle of getting up. Lee Taehee was stuck to the sofa like moss on a tree trunk and didn\u2019t move in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou become so curious about the weather when you hear a car in the parking lot, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ snorted. Im Seoyoung narrowed her eyes and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha only comes out of her room if I call her three times, but she can here you enter the parking lot from five stories below. It\u2019s like she has an antenna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen was I like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday. Yesterday. The day before!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even curious who it is when you go to the front door, you puppy dog.\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>Lee Songha tried to deny it and escaped to the bathroom. While I was talking to the girls, she quickly got ready as expected of a busy celebrity. I brought her out right away. The elevator went down more slowly than it went up.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha fiddled with the bill of her baseball cap, which was pressed down on her hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wash my hair because I was in a hurry. Are we going to the shop right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there is no schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha immediately raised her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to talk with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are we going on a drive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could feel her sleepiness take flight.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha hastily pressed the elevator button. Around five times in a second.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come down after washing my hair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only one who\u2019ll see you anyways. We won\u2019t leave the car, so you can just go as you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been a celebrity for four years. I can\u2019t go out like this. It\u2019ll be humiliating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would it be humiliating? Then should we talk in your home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be fine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who didn\u2019t get off despite arriving on the first floor, finally moved, dragging her feet. Seeing how she was pressing her baseball cap even in this situation made me laugh unknowingly.</p><br/><p>The unpleasant feeling was partly gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go and come back. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in ten minutes!\u201d</p><br/><p>She quickly went up and came back down in ten minutes as promised. The tips of her hair were still slightly wet, and she changed her lipstick as well. It was the coral color she normally wore.</p><br/><p>She got in the passenger seat as I started the car. She put on her seatbelt and looked at my chest as if she was checking if I had mine on as well. Then she opened the glove compartment to check if her snacks were still there.</p><br/><p>She leaned back into her seat and hummed. It was easy to tell she was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, what are we going to talk about? A next project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s next project.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her humming halted immediately.</p><br/><p>I started to drive while feeling her gaze prickle my cheek. The car handled smoother than when coming here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you talked with the CEO. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it a secret?\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.</p><br/><p>I had planned on slowly easing into it. I bit my impulsive tongue and glanced at her. She was looking at the glove compartment. No, she was staring at it. She bit her lower lip.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also know that this is a good opportunity for you. It\u2019s also good for us. We don\u2019t know which team we\u2019ll be assigned to after the restructuring, but the unnies and I will be able to join your team without any issues if this goes well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha took gummy bears out from the glove compartment. She ripped the package open.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, I didn\u2019t want to ask- I just didn\u2019t want to be the one to bring it up first\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to bring you with me. I\u2019ve been talking with Chief Kim and the Team 3 Leader about Neptune as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>While it wasn\u2019t certain, I made it seem like it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause Blackout and Neptune succeeded one after the other, we might introduce an idol trainee system with this restructuring. Then the team leader and Chief Kim will become busy, so even if I don\u2019t bother with Son Chaeyoung, Neptune will be assigned to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it. It\u2019s not like it doesn\u2019t bother me but I\u2019m not okay with it but I\u2019ll be able to endure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She mumbled before continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have other people you want to bring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re changing who you\u2019re managing, and this is simply an opportunity for you. An opportunity where you can pursue your ambition with total concentration as you mentioned. Also, during that time, I have my own plans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlans?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m currently chewing on a bear\u2019s gallbladder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGall-what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha put another gummy bear in her mouth and chewed on it diligently.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bear\u2019s gallbladder. The gallbladder I\u2019m chewing now will one day return as bear soup.\u201d<sup>{2}</sup></p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know where to start on her remark.</p><br/><p>I drove slowly as I turned to my side.</p><br/><p>Biting off a gummy bear\u2019s head, Lee Songha smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go on a drive, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader asked while picking their ears. It was the same reaction when I said it to Neptune. When I summarized my discussion with CEO Baek Hansung, they leaned back into the meeting room chairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was the CEO. That\u2019s why he called you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said with a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was why Team 2 chiefs have been noisy lately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they hear that you\u2019re going to try to persuade her, they\u2019ll cause even more of an uproar.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Lucky Charm, you have no free time with Pretty Girls, Neptune, and Nam Joyoon. Do you think you can take care of Son Chaeyoung as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already took care of the urgent problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018took care of\u2019. Aren\u2019t Pretty Girls releasing their album the day after tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said as though he found this ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir complexions have been changing every day. Their faces were orange yesterday. Even the project members are nervous. Aren\u2019t you too calm as the team leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was because I knew how it would go.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader crossed his arms and joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right that a team leader shouldn\u2019t be nervous since it\u2019ll agitate his team members even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you know that, then you should stop fussing about every little thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping you calm down by acting like that. Anyways, it\u2019s true that you need to be composed, but you\u2019re a little excessive. The broadcast was a success and their fame has increased, so you think it\u2019s fine to not care too much about their album? Even still, they need to have a good finish\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? He apparently said that their song would be first on the weekly charts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Crazy. You\u2019ve started again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo shook their heads in unison.</p><br/><p>After hearing about how I was crazy so many times that it was echoing in my ears, the Team 3 Leader suddenly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you sticking to Son Chaeyoung. Was the Team 2 Leader not angry when he heard about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he knows yet. They are going to talk about it in the CEO\u2019s office soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? With his personality, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll pat your shoulder and wish you good luck?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader patted my shoulder.</p><br/><p>Unlike his words, his gaze read, \u2018You\u2019re screwed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Anyways, his reaction was calmer than I expected like someone with ulterior motives. Even the director looked surprised as his eyes widened. CEO Baek Hansung was still calm. I couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I, I never thought I would say this.</p><br/><p>I would have tried to change this situation if I had seen it in one of my future visions.</p><br/><p>There was no turning back now. With a big breath, I took a step.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to persuade Ms. Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Into the natural disaster.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Management Business Department Team 2\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Having heard the results of the meeting, Chief Jo noisily tapped the back of his foot on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, but if, if Son Chaeyoung changes her mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader shook his head. His eyes looked like he was completely lost in his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Son Chaeyoung\u2019s reaction is different from the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDifferent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s serious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader rubbed his beard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that\u2019ll be solved with Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Her phone was off. Again.</p><br/><p>I glanced at her contact saved as \u2018The Crazy Bitch in This Area\u2019 and put my phone down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to call Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun of Team 2 swaggered over to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, her phone\u2019s off right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s common.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a time or day when Ms. Son Chaeyoung comes to the company?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have something like that. She doesn\u2019t come when we tell her to and won\u2019t leave when we tell her to. She only does outside schedules.\u201d</p><br/><p>He scanned my face with an odd gaze. His eyes seemed to indicate he was planning something.</p><br/><p>Soon, he smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about it from Chief Jo. You need to know more about Son Chaeyoung to even try to persuade her. Now really, I really don\u2019t understand. Well, she does have something going on today. I\u2019ll get you started so come with me if you have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun led the way as he replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo her home.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Originally \u2018goldfish poop\u2019, which is used to indicate how she sticks to Jung Sunwoo. Changed to puppy dog.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> Bear bile is apparently used in some traditional Chinese medicine, probably doesn\u2019t taste great. Also, the soup is technically beef-bone soup, but I changed it to bear soup to hopefully preserve some more of the meaning. Obviously, it still doesn\u2019t make sense (it\u2019s not supposed to), but I tried.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-175\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 175\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-177\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 177\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201465\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

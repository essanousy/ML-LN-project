In the corner, the security guards were busy scuffling with the spectators who were taking out their phones.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo, who now resembled a chihuahua, was wagging her tail at Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunbae, it\u2019s our first time meeting since the airport! Are you making a cameo appearance?\u201d</p><br/><p>I guess she really didn\u2019t remember.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was waiting to meet you again all this tim-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you not remember me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>For someone who struck the back of another person\u2019s head, she seemed too nonchalant.</p><br/><p>\u201cRe-remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot long ago. In the seventh-floor hallway. You were drunk. We saw each other then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith me? Uh, I blacked out that day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo\u2019s eyes shook. She was so taken aback that even her stuttering voice cracked. Not caring about her, Son Chaeyoung left while talking to Director Woo about the camera angle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, look here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo abrupted swung her head towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you were the one who discovered me that day. Was Chaeyoung sunbae there as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDi-did I say something improper in front of her while drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026 something improper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I or not? Quickly tell me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo shouted, stomping her feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did. Rather than saying something improper, I think it\u2019s like you showed off your true self.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what did I say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 You said some very offending and unpleasant words.\u201d</p><br/><p>I slightly frowned and shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaying stuff like who slept with who\u2026 You said things that would make people never want to associate with you ever again so I can\u2019t say anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRe-really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust thinking about it feels like it\u2019s dirtying my ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo\u2019s face paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say for her to be like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lying on the sunbed, Son Chaeyoung asked while glancing in her direction.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo was looking at us while looking like a nervous chihuahua that had made a mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t too far from the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it was true that she said some very insulting words in Son Chaeyoung\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>Though her target was me.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 I thought you said you weren\u2019t doing a cameo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come because of you. The director was just mistaken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said as she put her sunglasses on.</p><br/><p>I was wanted to say something, but simply opened my mouth a little and stopped. I was at a loss for words. There were too many times where I tangled with Son Chaeyoung that I didn\u2019t know where to start to untangle.</p><br/><p>No, to be honest, there wasn\u2019t a reason to nor did I want to.</p><br/><p>Although I was the one who brought up apologizing, her terrible past was still vivid in my mind. Even if she apologized with utmost sincerity, I wondered if I could talk with her like nothing happened.</p><br/><p>Not seeing her would be most comfortable, instead of constantly being entangled with her.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this, Son Chaeyoung said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI came here for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>I was about to turn around when she continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. A lot of people at work know that I wanted to work with you, but if you are disregarded out in society and people swear at you, what do I become? It makes it seem like I have a crappy eye for people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, that\u2019s why I came. But you handled it on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung looked at Seo Eunkyo again and shrugged.</p><br/><p>Then she exhaled and brushed her hair to the side. She touched the back of her neck, which looked slender enough to fit in one hand, then grabbed the sunbed\u2019s armrests a couple times. She also opened and closed her mouth a few times as if she was beating around the bush.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t see her expression because her sunglasses covered half her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung began to speak.</p><br/><p>I heard hurried steps behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Her bathrobe was tightly wrapped around her like someone had rolled her up in a blanket.</p><br/><p>All that was exposed were her flawless, milky-white arms and legs.</p><br/><p>The gazes that had previously focused on Son Chaeyoung now fixated on Lee Songha. There weren\u2019t just one or two faces that were enchanted. Another scuffle broke out between the spectators and security guards. There seemed to be a bigger commotion than before.</p><br/><p>Who amongst them would know?</p><br/><p>That, at this moment, the peaceful swimming pool was, in fact, a war zone.</p><br/><p>I took some deep breaths. Since I was stuck between two people who always caused trouble when together, every hair on my body was alert. Making all sorts of preparations wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, I changed into my swimsuit.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed she didn\u2019t notice Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>Unlike her usual self that was unconcerned with her surroundings, she was conscious of her surroundings as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I changed into it, it was a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s too racy. It exposes so much skin. The stylist unnies said it was fine, but I wanted oppa to tell me how it-\u201c</p><br/><p>While Lee Songha was hesitantly talking while fiddling with her fingers, Son Chaeyoung suddenly got up from her sunbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an amateur.\u201d</p><br/><p>She took off her sunglasses with one hand and untied her bathrobe with the other.</p><br/><p>The next moment, her bathrobe slid down her shoulders. Then she clearly revealed her white bikini. Sounds which seemed like admiration or screaming erupted around us.</p><br/><p>My gaze also drifted to her for an instant.</p><br/><p>Only for a moment. Just a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha asked in a monotone voice.</p><br/><p>Her gaze, which alternated between me and Son Chaeyoung, looked serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Did you rent the entire swimming pool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe film crew did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to make a cameo appearance. Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said while placing her hand on her hip.</p><br/><p>As she glanced up and down at Lee Songha who was wrapped tightly in her bathrobe.</p><br/><p>It was clear that her actions disintegrated the last bits of Lee Songha\u2019s rationality. Her wariness of Son Chaeyoung, which continued since she met her at the airport, exploded like a grenade thrown without its safety pin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an amateur.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha energetically untied her bathrobe.</p><br/><p>Then, as if showing off, she placed both hands on her hips.</p><br/><p>She wore a black monokini that was prepared for her top star Lee Sohee role.</p><br/><p>I understood why Lee Songha said it looked racy. Just judging purely by exposed skin, Son Chaeyoung wearing a bikini had more. However, the monokini Lee Songha wore was designed with intersecting strings, it was oddly\u2026</p><br/><p>Stop it, you crazy bastard!</p><br/><p>Now was not the time for this. This was a battlefield. A battlefield.</p><br/><p>I forced myself to look away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, the mood\u2019s great! Have the two of you already gotten into your roles?\u201d</p><br/><p>My heart quickly relaxed when I saw the hairy Director Song.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Lee Songha and Son Chaeyoung entered a ceasefire at the director\u2019s appearance. Director Woo made a frame with his thumb and index fingers as he looked in our direction, smiling in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, yeah, perhaps Son Chaeyoung\u2019s cameo appearance would have a positive effect. Writer Jang said that she wanted actors to fly off the page and feel more realistic.</p><br/><p>Maybe Writer Jang would be satisfied looking at this scene?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scene looks good. Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Woo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think this\u2019ll work great? I already finished editing it in my head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat great. It\u2019s the very important first scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I replied, Director Woo looked at me with a sly expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that, chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it would be wonderful if you also made a cameo appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really going to do it? A cameo?\u201d</p><br/><p>A makeup artist asked while tapping my face with a compact.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to. If it\u2019s a scene with Songha, then her airtime will increase and the director said he already finished editing it in his mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>My face was already out there. I didn\u2019t think it would cause a huge incident because I made a cameo appearance for a couple seconds. If Lee Songha\u2019s first scene would be longer and increase its impact from this, then it wasn\u2019t something I couldn\u2019t handle.</p><br/><p>After changing into an outfit, I approached Director Woo.</p><br/><p>Director Woo and the Well-Made Production staff were gathered in front of the monitor. I looked at the screen from behind as well.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, Son Chaeyoung, and Seo Eunkyo were talking to each other.</p><br/><p>The sight in front of me was busy with reflective panels, lights, a camera on rails, a boom mic, and a jib camera that moved in the air, but the scene reflect on the screen seemed like a completed drama.</p><br/><p>There was a tremendous power struggle going on between two very prideful top actresses.</p><br/><p>And an aloof heiress who couldn\u2019t stand it and cut in.</p><br/><p>I observed the screen while thinking of their roles.</p><br/><p>\u201cNG! We\u2019ll start from the beginning again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Woo raised his voice while clicking his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Eunkyo, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike his happy appearance, he looked completely unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so dispirited? Are you not well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, director! I\u2019ll do it properly this time! Sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo bowed apologetically.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo, who had a gloomy complexion, talked with her similar unhappy manager. Not long after, the cameras began rolling again. However, Director Woo\u2019s expression still didn\u2019t look bright.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad, but maybe it\u2019s because the other two are so eye-catching? She seems to lose out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than losing out, it\u2019s more like she\u2019s squashed by their presence?\u201d</p><br/><p>A production producer from Well-Made Production added in a quiet voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Ms. Son Chaeyoung and Ms. Lee Songha are saying their lines, the mood\u2019s overflowing with tension, yet when Ms. Seo Eunkyo joins in, it completely deflates. It\u2019s no use even if I give her directions. We might have to cut some of her lines and reduce her screentime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was really good during the reading session. Maybe she\u2019s not the type that does well in front of the camera?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe might be. Well, it\u2019s fine. The scene is abundant with just the other two.\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation went over to a more exciting topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Lee Songha\u2019s acting is very realistic. She\u2019s a monster rookie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rumors about her acting skills were so glamorous that I only believed half of it. This industry is known for exaggerating, but seeing her act in person, it feels like the rumors didn\u2019t go far enough? It\u2019s like Lee Sohee from the script is standing there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of my lips happily curled up.</p><br/><p>The production producer admired,</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Ms. Son Chaeyoung, there\u2019s nothing more to say. I heard Writer Jang originally wrote Lee Sohee while thinking about Son Chaeyoung?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I heard it, I thought her image didn\u2019t suit the role, but seeing her now, it might have been great if we went with her as well? Especially when comparing the two next to each other. Her cameo role feels livelier than the lead actress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust look at how much experience she\u2019s had.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though Ms. Lee Songha isn\u2019t doing a bad job, Ms. Son Chaeyoung is just so-\u201c</p><br/><p>Someone poked the production producer\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Turning around, the production producer jolted from her seat upon discovering me.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung. That is\u2026 What I meant wasn\u2019t that\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed my expression didn\u2019t look very pleased considering how nervous the producer was.</p><br/><p>She did her best to compliment Lee Songha, saying how she was speaking nonsense just now and that Lee Songha\u2019s acting skills were topnotch.</p><br/><p>I controlled my expression and nodded.</p><br/><p>Then I pondered while observing Lee Songha moving in the screen.</p><br/><p>Since I was a cameo now anyways, I needed to boost Lee Songha as much as possible.</p><br/><p>How should I go about doing that?</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung will go in for this scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of role am I playing? I can\u2019t prepare if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Woo patted my shoulder with his thick hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better if you don\u2019t prepare. If amateurs prepare for and think about their roles, it becomes too plainly obvious that they are acting and it\u2019ll look awkward. We\u2019re going to film your reactions without and dialogue so don\u2019t feel pressured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour role will be Ms. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOka\u2026 Pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s manager. Ah, please wait for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I stood rigidly, Director Woo approached Lee Songha and Son Chaeyoung. Both their faces become strange when they listen to Director Woo. Then they looked at me.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was obviously taken aback.</p><br/><p>She felt like Lee Sohee just moments before, yet what did he say for her to act like this?</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung had an expression that made it difficult to tell if she was smiling or frowning.</p><br/><p>Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>Director Woo soon called out to me so I came over.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha flapped her mouth like she wanted to say something.</p><br/><p>Director Woo requested,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s a cameo scene, Ms. Songha and Ms. Chaeyoung, you can adlib as much as you want. Let\u2019s make it as realistic as possible. Just say to yourself, \u2018I\u2019m the craziest bitch in this industry.\u2019 Although it might be uncomfortable for you to say rude things to each other because of the seniority between you two, just close your eyes and bear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncomfortable?</p><br/><p>Director Woo looked at me and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Chief Jung just needs to react realistically. The rest will be taken care of by the actresses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Woo asked one thing from me.</p><br/><p>To approach them like I had been looking for Son Chaeyoung. Then to leave it to the two actresses.</p><br/><p>I waited for the director\u2019s signal as I watched Lee Songha and Son Chaeyooung act.</p><br/><p>Just then, the director gave me the signal.</p><br/><p>Gulping dryly, I approached the two who were arguing.</p><br/><p>Multiple thoughts crossed my mind. My steps should be quick since I was supposed to be looking for Son Chaeyoung. Damn it, but why did I have to be Son Chaeyoung\u2019s manager? I couldn\u2019t get in my role.</p><br/><p>Just as my foot stepped into the camera frame,</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung cheerfully grabbed my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood timing. Come over here! Do you know what she just said to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She pointed at Lee Songha with one hand and dragged me with her other.</p><br/><p>Dazed, I looked at Lee Songha who was blocking Son Chaeyoung\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>What happened next went by in an instant.</p><br/><p>A cocktail splashed on my face and a cold lemon wedge slapped my cheek.</p><br/><p>Then I heard Director Woo\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNG!\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-124\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 124\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-126\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 126\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201363\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

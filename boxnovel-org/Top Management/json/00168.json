She ran away, unable to meet the other members\u2019 gazes. Her eyes, desperately looking for a place to hide, landed on me.</p><br/><p>She painfully bit her lip.</p><br/><p>The words that left her mouth clearly rang in my ears.</p><br/><p>\u2018Our company sent Sunwoo oppa to us, and I was fortunate enough to be in that team.\u2019 \u2018I tried all sorts of things, but nothing never happened to me.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019m the dregs of my team right now.\u2019</p><br/><p>I knew. I was aware of it. There was no way I wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Since I could tell she was trying hard.</p><br/><p>The foresight that let me glance at Lee Songha and Lee Taehee\u2019s success. The same one that told me of Pretty Girls\u2019 success, who I was only slightly acquainted to, was heartlessly quiet when it came to Im Seoyoung and LJ. As though it didn\u2019t notice them.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t like I was hung up on them like Nam Joyoon either.</p><br/><p>However, even if there wasn\u2019t anything like that, I wanted to make them successful.</p><br/><p>LJ\u2019s situation was a bit better. She was famous for her talent since she was an underground rapper and was one of the top female rappers in the country. There were even plans of giving her a solo track on the album and making a separate single album if that went well.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, things were difficult for Im Seoyoung.</p><br/><p>Although she was good at singing and dancing, this industry was overflowing with people like her. That was why I put her on any entertainment programs I could get. The person I know as Im Seoyoung was lovely. She was someone who people would like.</p><br/><p>But the camera didn\u2019t really pick up those aspects of her.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to do better.\u2019 \u2018I need to try harder.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because of those thoughts.</p><br/><p>She tried her all in changing, but it was naught.</p><br/><p>That was why I set up this playing field.</p><br/><p>A playing field that could be the turning point for Neptune and Im Seoyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that was because I was caught up in their crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung said in a bright voice.</p><br/><p>As if she was trying to change the mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are times when you find little things big and when negative emotions explode! Thinking back, I think I might have been on a period that day!\u201d</p><br/><p>The living room became even quieter. The moment Im Seoyoung, who couldn\u2019t even breathe properly and didn\u2019t know what to do, stood up, a pale hand held her ankle. It was LJ. LJ said to Im Seoyoung, who was flailing to escape,</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just anyone. LJ apologized.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung instantly froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling you dummy and idiot all this time, I went too far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why are you acting like this? I know it was a joke! What I\u2019m-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I knew words came true, then I would have been more careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung, who was shaking her head and hands side-to-side, stopped. It seemed she understood the odd meaning behind LJ\u2019s words as her eyes widened. LJ pulled and sat her back down and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDregs? If you\u2019re dregs, then am I crumbs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprised, Im Seoyoung jolted in her seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crumbs! You-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are the ones who get schedules on their own. Do I have anything going for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ gestured to the two on the sofa with her eyes before continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cAll I did was get featured on a couple tracks. I\u2019m on entertainment and radio shows because I\u2019m a set with you. If you are the dregs of Neptune, then I\u2019m its crumbs. No, not just normal crumbs, I must be dust.\u201d</p><br/><p>She placed her elbow on her raised knee. Her chin rested on her hand.</p><br/><p>The corner of LJ\u2019s slanted lips was covered by her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI look confident all the time? That\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to look embarrassed or shallow. I\u2019m better than you when you try to keep your expression under control. I\u2019m a master at acting like nothing\u2019s wrong and like I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m a mixed-race.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her hand covered half her face.</p><br/><p>This time, Lee Taehee spoke to Im Seoyoung, who stiff like a tree struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung, I always think that I am an incompetent leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung\u2019s complexion was turning closer to black.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee calmly looked at Im Seoyoung. Like always, her eyes were like a placid lake with no wind. However, they were dark inside. They were so dark if there was something lurking underneath.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because we have you that our team is can continue without problems. You do what other team leaders should be doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-stop it, unni! I\u2019m really fine. You don\u2019t have to comfort me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to just comfort you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout you, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to last without any troubles when we were unknown. Without you, we wouldn\u2019t as close as a family right now. I have no confidence in making a team like this. So why are you the dregs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears pooled in Im Seoyoung\u2019s teary eyes.</p><br/><p>Still holding onto her ankle like it was some sort of lifeline, LJ joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, do you know what our residence is like when you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an area of solitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung stopped crying and tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-area of solitude?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet we don\u2019t say a word to each other when you\u2019re not here. Taehee unni is cooped up in her room, drinking beer and making songs, like some senior citizen. Songha reads the same scripts repeatedly like some social outcast. If they are moving around, it\u2019s only to the washroom or fridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said, gesturing to Lee Taehee and Lee Songha. This time, she pointed at herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Im Seoyoung\u2019s expression became serious, LJ let out a short sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that our relationship is bad. It\u2019s just how we are. That\u2019s why the cameras in our home are usually off when you\u2019re not here. The producer said that there wasn\u2019t a rat\u2019s poop worth of airtime to get from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said before adding,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ flatly turned her gaze.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee\u2019s gaze momentarily fell on me. She spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to Sunwoo oppa before playing my songs to you. I probably wouldn\u2019t have told you that they were done if he didn\u2019t have a good reaction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? The songs were great!\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ and Im Seoyoung asked simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung stretched her neck out, her previous crouching appearance gone without a trace. She continued by saying how she felt like lightning struck when she heard Lee Taehee\u2019s songs and how she felt they should be their title tracks.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee rubbed the back of her neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not confident in my songs. I was scared I would fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she added while looking at Im Seoyoung,</p><br/><p>\u201cStuff like that happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange silence hung in the air. Having expressed their inner thoughts, the members exchanged glances. Although it was as silent as before, it wasn\u2019t a splitting silence. This time, it was a bit moist.</p><br/><p>Like the ground after rain.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung took a deep breath and was about to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I was the useless person in our team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said as if she had been waiting for an opportunity to say something.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the living room was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich bastard said that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, including Im Seoyoung, shouted as they turned to look at her.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha glanced at me. Seeing that, the girls began agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cOp-oppa did?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told oppa that. Before Cat Guardian Ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dummy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that ever again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t think that ever again too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung, who was about to scold her, flinched.</p><br/><p>She bit her lip before nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I get it. I get it so don\u2019t think those thoughts again. Why would you be useless? Look how much we\u2019ve\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha cut her off and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI still think that occasionally. Being able to help the team through my acting used to be a motivating factor for me. However, the mood of our team has become a bit unsettled because of me. There are a lot of bad rumors as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was calm, but her gaze, looking at the crumbs on the rug, was slightly wet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to return things to how they were before, but I don\u2019t know how. I want to keep living here. But I worry if I really should in case the mood worsens because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you can! It\u2019s our home! It\u2019s fine if you mark your territory in the kitchen as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung said in an almost screaming voice.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha stuck the nail in.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re dregs and LJ unni is crumbs, then I\u2019m a nuisance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it! Don\u2019t say it! Stop that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung waved her hands as her face reddened.</p><br/><p>Beside her, LJ mumbled to herself,</p><br/><p>\u201cA rash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Stop it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my instinct.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ shrugged. Soon, Im Seoyoung and LJ began fighting. Having said what she wanted, Lee Songha rested her head against Lee Taehee\u2019s thigh, and Lee Taehee brushed Lee Songha\u2019s long hair as she watched the two fight like cats and dogs.</p><br/><p>It was a normal sight.</p><br/><p>The corners of my mouths curled up without me knowing. With a smile, I was watching the scene in front of me and the laptop screen when Im Seoyoung rushed at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa! You should have at least told me about that scene ahead of time! I almost fainted!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her small palms smacked my arm. Her slaps noisily filled the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for not telling you before. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while scratching my cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to show the viewers this side of you. One where you aren\u2019t aware of the cameras and act normally. I thought that it would be a big hit if we could properly show that to the viewers..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-bit hit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her slaps became weaker.</p><br/><p>I placed the laptop in front of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung scanned the screen with an odd look. I had searched her name on the portal site. There were countless articles with Neptune and her name in the headline and continuously updating social media reactions.</p><br/><p>There was also \u2018Im Seoyoung\u2019 on the real-time search rankings.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung wavered as she grabbed the laptop. The tip of her finger touched the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIm Seoyoung\u2019s not going to be able to sleep tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ smiled as she placed her chin on Im Seoyoung\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou always sleep after checking internet reactions when you\u2019re on TV. If you want to read everything, you won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just read it all night then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung hugged the laptop. Her eyes were glazed like she was entranced.</p><br/><p>Then she turned to look at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this was filmed a long time ago. What does it have to do with not telling me today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe filming hasn\u2019t ended yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>I gestured with my cheek at the daze Im Seoyoung. When I gestured to various placed in the living room, her gaze followed behind. Then after a long time, Im Seoyoung\u2019s eyes bulged as though she discovered something. Her trembling hand pointed at the shelf.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA camera. We installed them when you weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung hastily looked at me. Then she looked at the other members who didn\u2019t seem surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you. I wanted to show the viewers this side of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe filmed all of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung dropped the laptop.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Late at night, I sent the recordings to two places.</p><br/><p>One was IBC Producer Yoo Sooyoung\u2019s editing room.</p><br/><p>The other was W&amp;U\u2019s PR Team.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park watched the recordings and made an odd smile. It was similar to mine. This was because the recordings clearly recorded a side of Neptune we had long since wanted to reveal to the public.</p><br/><p>Lots would change depending on how we used these recordings.</p><br/><p>The night was long and busy and heated with excitement.</p><br/><p>The project team, including me, and the PR Team were all working hard on it. We also received help from Making Film\u2019s staff. After staying up all night, we create a ten-minute clip.</p><br/><p>We removed all the inadequate parts and only got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>The drizzle, which began early in the morning, was started to stop.</p><br/><p>As the internet reactions of yesterday\u2019s hidden camera broadcast were beginning to cool and as Im Seoyoung\u2019s name began to slip from the real-time search rankings, we uploaded the clip to the portal site.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-167\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 167\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-169\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 169\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201449\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

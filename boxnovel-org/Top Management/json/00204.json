There is no final draft without the first.\u201d</p><br/><p>I propped my chin up and stared at Director Joo Jaechan. He looked like he desperately wanted to escape from this embarrassing and uncomfortable situation. Director Joo Jaechan forced a smile as though he was suppressing his emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you perhaps talk to Director Oh Hyunkyung? I don\u2019t know what she told you, but the matter has been settled internally. She caused a ruckus at the film production company not long ago. There\u2019s a reason why the investors want to assign the project to me instead of her\u2026 You also said that you liked my directing.\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes gradually began to shine with madness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a project I must direct with my own hands. It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew it too.</p><br/><p>That it would become a great work in his hands.</p><br/><p>While he couldn\u2019t keep his hands still, crossing and uncrossing his fingers, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWill there be any problems in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Oh Hyunkyung. She seemed very attached to the scenario. It\u2019ll become noisy if she files a lawsuit once the movie goes into production. Articles will also mention actors\u2019 names.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan blinked. Then, with an excited face, he jumped from his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not need to worry about that! No one would film a movie if you could sue investment and production companies with this. Who would work with a director like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>He glanced at my expression before chatting more excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis. She already signed over the rights to the production company. Because the production company is adjusting the movie\u2019s budget, they\u2019ll have to do their best to cooperate with investment companies. That is why a lawsuit isn\u2019t worth mentioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot worth mentioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Director Oh Hyunkyung will be credited as an embellishing writer. There are cases where a scenario goes through various writers, so you can\u2019t argue that it is your work because you edited it. This is how it works in this industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That is how this industry works.\u201d</p><br/><p>Around the time our talk was about to end, an employee knocked on the meeting room door.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung, you have another guest. The mood is a bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The whispering employee trailed his words. Director Oh Hyunkyung approached from the half-opened door. She looked like she aged ten years. Thick veins filled her eyes, making the whites in her eyes look red.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for barging in again, team leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>She bowed then stood rigid in place as though struck by lightning when she noticed Director Joo Jaechan. The person who looked like she was about to die now looked like she was ready to kill.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou rat-faces bast\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat great timing. I just happened to finish talking with the team leader.</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan nonchalantly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will await your call, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>He bid farewell, as though showing off to her, before passing her. Even though this took less than a minute, Director Oh Hyunkyung\u2019s complexion went from deathly black to pale white. She faltered like she had lost her spirit and sat down in the seat in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much of the situation did he tell you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat the main investment company opposed casting Joyoon hyung, and that the director was likely to be replaced. This is the most unsettling production circumstances I have encountered so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyungkyung\u2019s head drooped.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly sorry that things ended up this way after proposing it to you so confidently. I was sincere when I said that I thought Mr. Nam Joyoon was perfect as the male lead. This was something I should have persuaded the investment company. But the situation suddenly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, investment companies may have different options on the cast than you. Because they also have a big say on the matter. I understand the situation. What are you planning on doing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if my words stung, Director Oh Hyunkyung flinched. She simply opened and closed her dry lips for a moment before hastily getting up. She desperately pleaded,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, I know this is a shameless request, but if you really like the scenario, could you consider Ms. Lee Songha or Ms. Son Chaeyoung for the female lead? Then I could try to persuade the investment companies again. If you have any conditions, I\u2019ll definitely\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her teary voice dampened. She had been avoiding my gaze, worried about what my reaction would be, but now she raised her head and checked my expression. The next moment, her face dropped in despair.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I am in my mid-forties. An age overflowing with dignity.</p><br/><p>I was the CEO of a global management company who wore a classic suit, one that those British secret service agents would wear, and worked in a luxurious office akin to that of a penthouse apartment. After convincing myself this, I became more comfortable in confronting CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you bring your resignation letter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, damn it.</p><br/><p>\u201cResignation letter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the type of face you\u2019re making. You\u2019ve been glaring at me for a while now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy face is always like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that, but it seems particularly resistive today.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung laughed in a low voice before asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not a resignation letter, have you come to prepare an exclusive contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you even do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want. I told you that I\u2019ll manage you like a celebrity. Do you also want a signing fee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to do City Jungle.\u201d</p><br/><p>I poured cold water onto the warming mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI tried to forcefully give it up, but it felt like my insides were turning.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven celebrities can express their opinion when they aren\u2019t considered rookies anymore. Whether it\u2019s years of experience or fame, I believe I have passed that of a rookie. Also, above all, you are someone who respects the option of the celebrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave some lip service at the end, but the mood was still chilly. I felt like I would freeze to death.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I not say it so that you understand? Other celebrities can get back up if they fail once, however, your title is like a sand castle. Once you fail, its strategic value collapses. I had thought I gave you a great offer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think that it was a great offer since I would be walking a smooth path if I just do as the company decides. If I just follow that path, my career would also be excellent. It\u2019s a great opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you are aware. Then why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had a similar experience. Once you start on that path, you end up getting hung up on it like an addict. And if that path cuts off, you get withdraw symptoms like a crazy person. It\u2019ll become difficult to take a single step on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>I swept away all thoughts on going on different paths and stared at CEO Baek Hansung. He was also staring at me. He no longer kept up his composure and gentle smile. He had no expression.</p><br/><p>I brought up my conclusion, which I had wrung my brain to come to.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why, rather than getting swayed my opportunities, I plan on using them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>If a movie with a high risk of failure was a problem\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI will increase the movie\u2019s potential with my own hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Strategic value. A sand-castle-like title.</p><br/><p>In order to not get hung up on those things, I will create my own worth through my own ways.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cA declaration of war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only one who\u2019s ever declared war on the CEO. He\u2019ll be the only one ever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the Team 2 Leader, who\u2019s been at the company for so long, was cut off in an instant. Where does he get the courage? I think he\u2019s a sociopath or something. How can a normal person with over two years of experience declare war to his CEO\u2019s face?\u201d</p><br/><p>I corrected the fellows who were chatting near my desk so that I could hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t to the point of declaring war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you said, \u2019Screw you, I\u2019m going to do things my way,\u2019 then that\u2019s a declaration of war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you prepare a resignation letter? You might end up having to leave without saying goodbye, so wouldn\u2019t it be best if we had a farewell party ahead of time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader, Kim Hyunjo, Chief Lee Bongjoon, and Chief Sung Uimin said one after the other. While they were joking, their faces were wrought with worry. Like they were certain I was going to be fired soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you become tired of company life? Do you just want to act crookedly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired, rather I\u2019m completely motivated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amongst their dumbfounded faces, Kim Hyunjo rubbed his face as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The first place I went to was the outdoor filming set, a mud pool, of Good Friends. After greeting Producer Yoo Sooyoung, who became the main Good Friends producer after completing Making Film, I went to see the girls. They were on as guests as part of their comeback special, so all four of them rushed over to me.</p><br/><p>Covered in mud.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy! Rather than giving us hugs for our hard work, are you running away from us because we are dirty? Were you that type of person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am. Don\u2019t come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four of them stuck to me, and soon, I was covered in mud. Lee Kwanwoo simply flinched his hands as he watched from afar. He seemed to have already been caught as his thick arms coming out his t-shirt and neck were covered in mud.</p><br/><p>LJ even rubbed mud under my shirt as she grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look since you\u2019re here. Today\u2019s shoot is dirty and fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep it dirty and fun. I have things to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is a manager busier than his girl group, who just made a comeback?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung grumbled. At least they had the energy to chitchat. Lee Taehee simply breathed, completely exhausted. She seemed to have been stuck in the mud the longest as her appearance was the most spectacular.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha avoided my gaze as she asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cI look like the poop emoji right now. Should I go take a shower?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you look good, like microwaved chocolate ice cream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChocolate ice cream?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice brightened. Lee Songha glanced at my face before smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour face looks brighter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks for the mud pack. I put a scenario in the passenger seat for you,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA scenario? Did you come here to give me that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s eyes shined. I nonchalantly shrugged.</p><br/><p>I was worried she would pick it if I showed that I was interested in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor multiple reasons. I wanted to see you girls before you went on your out-of-city schedule and give you a new scenario I received so that you could read it during your free time. Let me know if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like someone said, a project was chosen by both the manager and celebrity.</p><br/><p>I left the set and drove to a small supermarket near a one-room apartment. Nam Joyoon was putting rice, curry, black bean sauce, meatballs and the like in a yellow shopping basket.<sup>{1}</sup> He made an awkward expression when he saw me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s my first time seeing you. You\u2019re probably buying stuff to fill your fridge with since I was coming over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon just laughed. I stacked his basket with rice and fruits and placed it on the counter as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought over another scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMovie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s best to read up to this one and decide on your next project. I\u2019ll ask a nutritionist to set up a diet for you, so follow that starting tomorrow. You need to maintain your body if you are going to work all day and night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s expression completely changed when I mentioned filming.</p><br/><p>The expression of the middle-aged woman at the counter also changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you get a job? Oh, that\u2019s great news when you were going around with nothing to do!\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving Nam Joyoon, who was the official bum in his neighborhood, I dropped by my house. I wiped away the mud still stuck here and there, paid particular attention to my attire, and once I had a clean appearance like a salesman, I drove out to Chungmuro.</p><br/><p>Amongst the densely populated forest of buildings, I found one with a huge banner of Alive and entered.</p><br/><p>The moment SBE Film\u2019s project producer saw my face, he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you come to ask for any new, good scenarios?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did he greet me happily and led the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cI definitely thought you had a condition for coming. I\u2019m now more afraid of phone calls from you than debt collectors. I told you I will contact you when we receive a good scenario. We have our relationship from Alive. It\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many times have you made that promise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, but all the good scenarios have dried up these days. There are none!\u201d</p><br/><p>We entered the meeting room while joking. An employee quickly brought over some drinks.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you didn\u2019t come to see scenarios, then why\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to show you something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do? Show me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I handed the project producer an envelope. He received it with a dazed face before taking the City Jungle scenario out of it. After scanning the title and synopsis, his face became even more perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scenario? I think I saw this before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt also came to SBE?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless a production company has an idea and is setting it up with a writer and director, most scenarios floating around Chungmuro without a production company usually pass through our company. We reject most of them for various reasons. I think this was one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it not good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember it well, but it probably was if we rejected it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He closed the scenario he was glancing through and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why did you come over to a production company with a scenario\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me W&amp;U is interested in production films? Is this a project W&amp;U is investing in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while shaking my head.</p><br/><p>The project producer frowned like he had just heard some amazing nonsense.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Those are references to well-known instant foods.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-203\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 203\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-205\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 205\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201514\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Think about it. If we can\u2019t get absorbed in our roles, it\u2019ll be funny. If we can, then it\u2019ll be awkward. Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought about it, but it isn\u2019t awkward. I thi- I can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said confidently.</p><br/><p>However, her hand wasn\u2019t simply fidgeting with the scenario, it was crumbling it. Also, it seemed like she was trying to read my expression. Whenever her long, delicate brows rose, her black eyes would glance over my mouth, eyes, or forehead.</p><br/><p>A sudden sense of disharmony ran down my spine.</p><br/><p>The figure of Lee Songha, who was especially friendly with me, slowly appeared in my mind. While I didn\u2019t have the sharpest senses, this was a bit chilly.</p><br/><p>Maybe\u2026 Should I probe her a bit?</p><br/><p>I used my rigid lips to smile as I asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, are you perhaps-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s work so I have to do a good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha abruptly cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am really confident in being able to focus, no matter scene it is. It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>She emphasized with a nonchalant face. The chilling feeling that had slapped both my cheeks had disappeared without a trace. Was I excessively sensitive? Well, she was seven years younger than me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that you won\u2019t be able to act.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, you\u2019ll be able to focus as you get used to it. So let\u2019s read the script together. It\u2019s better with you than the acting teacher. I need to practice a lot so that my next project is a success and I succeed as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my reply, Lee Songha smiled slightly as she calmly organized the scenarios.</p><br/><p>Seeing her like this, my heart slumped down. It was a real relief that I didn\u2019t finish what I was saying just now. If I did, I would be embarrassed forever.</p><br/><p>I let out the breath I had been holding back as I shook my head.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not think about pointless things from now on.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my goodness. Ms. Songha\u2019s lips are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey work with any color, right, chief?\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded at the fussy makeup artist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Do they all suit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha asked as her eyes turned towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. What wouldn\u2019t suit you?\u201d</p><br/><p>A small brush with lipstick rubbed against her lips. Her lips, which had reddened after repeatedly putting on and erasing lipstick, were pushed by the brush. Between her lips, which were slightly open to make it easier to brush\u2026</p><br/><p>There was no other way. Let\u2019s not look.</p><br/><p>I acted like I was looking around at the photo shoot set as I avoided looking at Lee Songha. Damn it. I kept becoming conscious of her actions and words. I felt like I would go crazy. Was it because I thought such useless thoughts about how she might\u2026?</p><br/><p>Or did I have spring fever? Was my testosterone stirring?</p><br/><p>\u201cChief!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was pressing my temples, the person in charge of the photo shoot approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the lip product is promoting its lasting power that won\u2019t erase after eating, we have to film her eating. Should we prepare a bag she can spit the food out in after chewing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? We were concerned because she\u2019s an actress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about other actresses, but Songha\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the staff\u2019s concerns evaporated as soon as they resumed the shoot.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha ate the crispy fried chicken thigh, cheese-covered lasagna, and a hamburger that was as big as two fists as though it was her first meal every time.</p><br/><p>She ate the food with gusto. Why was I so happy whenever I saw her eating like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe model is amazing, but is this a lip product photo shoot or a food photo shoot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven her eating amazes me. If she was my girlfriend, I would even empty my wallet to feed he-\u2026 I mean, sorry, chief. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hair team assistant, who was spouting nonsense, shut his mouth the moment our eyes met. I relaxed my frown and looked back towards Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>At some point, her food changed to a cream pasta. Wrapping a huge amount of pasta around her fork, she shoved it in her mouth. She wiped the cream on her lips with her fingers then licked her fingers with her tongue.</p><br/><p>That was all, yet my heart felt like it had suddenly jolted like an elevator.</p><br/><p>Was I crazy?</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah, that shocked me. I gasped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scene just now would make anyone, young, old, male, or female, gasp.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it wasn\u2019t just me. What a relief.</p><br/><p>Well, it would be weird if someone could be normal after seeing that. There were times in the past when my heart jolted because she was so pretty and her atmosphere really suited my preferences. I also quickly brushed those thoughts away and returned to normal.</p><br/><p>When I calmed down, the photo shoot was over.</p><br/><p>I was leaving with Lee Songha after saying our farewells to the cosmetic company, photo shoot team, and other staff members when Lee Songha showed me the seven different lipsticks in her pouch as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought them since they asked me to use them to promote the product. Oppa, which color did you like best?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI liked the third one you tried on.\u201d</p><br/><p>My throat became parched when I recalled the previous events so I gulped down a soda.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third one\u2026 Ah, \u2018coral orgasm\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost spit out my drink.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Coral what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey sometimes name cosmetics like this as sex appeal marketing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After calmly answering my question, Lee Songha took out the lipstick I had mentioned and rubbed it against her lips twice. It dyed her makeup-removed lips. The tips of her lips rose beautifully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also like this color. It looks like we have the same tastes. How interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I was going crazy.</p><br/><p>Placing Lee Songha, who was in a good mood, in front of me, I slapped my cheeks.</p><br/><p>I had to get it together. It would be troublesome if I let down my guard.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I felt like I had become Paul.</p><br/><p>The octopus that predicted the World Cup match results.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow really, do people in our company have nothing to do? Why are you all spectating someone picking a project they think will do well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy actor pushed me here, telling me that we should consider the project he picks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lounge was more crowded than ever. From familiar faces to people who I had never seen before, they came and watched me.</p><br/><p>Scenarios and synopses were uniformly spread on top of the table in front of me. Someone cheered me on, though I didn\u2019t know what he was cheering me on for. Anyways, he placed three soda cans in front of me like they were some sort of tribute.</p><br/><p>In front of me were Kim Hyunjo, the team 3 leader, and the director.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader smiled brightly as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust pick one, there\u2019s no pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere has never been a more uncomfortable moment in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel pressured and just choose the one you like! Is there one that you liked that didn\u2019t work out? At this point, you can consider it a skill instead of luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat puts more pressure on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mouth was dry. After downing a soda can, I stretched out my hand.</p><br/><p>Expectations, disbelief, and interest, various gazes landed on my hand. I took out a scenario and synopsis from the pile of papers. The stack of papers in my hand felt heavy.</p><br/><p>It was the final moment. There were no signs of my vision going black this time as well.</p><br/><p>Suppressing my disappointment, I placed the two projects down.</p><br/><p>One was a supporting role in a 34 billion won<sup>{1}</sup>, large-scale movie.</p><br/><p>The other was a lead role in a Korean-Chinese joint venture miniseries.</p><br/><p>These were the results of agonizing for sleepless nights.</p><br/><p>The murmurs grew louder. The two projects I picked were immediately handed to the director. Kim Hyunjo scanned the covers with his sharp eyes, while the team 3 leader asked as if confirming,</p><br/><p>\u201cThose? Really? Those two?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I think those two are the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo let out a sigh after hearing my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a relief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how nervous I was that you would push a ridiculous synopsis and say, \u2018this is the one,\u2019 like before? Fortunately, we had selected those two as first and second choices as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, objectively speaking, they were projects that were a shame to miss out on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like something big will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader and Kim Hyunjo said. The director got up and waved the two projects in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll closely examine these two projects with the CEO. The CEO is very interested in the projects you chose this time as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went upstairs with a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>I closely controlled by heart.</p><br/><p>The die had already been cast. All that remained now was to make the next project a success no matter what.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>W&amp;U Management Business Department Team 3. New recruit, Lee Kwanwoo. 26 years old.</p><br/><p>He saw something during his first meeting with his superior, Chief Jung Sunwoo, on his first day.</p><br/><p>A terrifying thorny path welcomed by the sound of a devil playing a horn.</p><br/><p>The moment they met, Jung Sunwoo stared at Lee Kwanwoo\u2019s face for a long while. Then he smiled, saying, \u2018Let\u2019s work hard together.\u2019 His smile seemed like he would flop him down and whip him if he made a mistake during work.</p><br/><p>For a smooth work life, Lee Kwanwoo gathered information about Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>When he visited the PR Team to introduce himself, he was flooded with information.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Mr. Sunwoo is your superior. Oh, my. His first impression was scary, right? He looks like he has a bad personality, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>The PR Team employees persistently egged him on when he replied late.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh? If my superior was Mr. Sunwoo, I think I would be very uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI might have thought about quitting. Geez, it\u2019s not good for my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are having fun. Stop teasing the recruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The PR Team Leader grinned as she joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo\u2019s impression is very\u2026 intense, but he\u2019s a good person. He\u2019s quick-witted too. Seeing how he treats Neptune, he\u2019s responsible and takes care of his own people. He takes action when necessary. Also, he\u2019s very talented. If you follow him well, your future might be as open as an 8-lane highway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, Lee Kwanwoo obtained information from the Neptune members.</p><br/><p>When Jung Sunwoo had left the waiting room for a bit, Im Seoyoung smiled as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNew recruit oppa and Sunwoo oppa really give off contrasting feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. In terms of animals, you are like a large, very docile dog with your big build and drooping eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what kind of animal is Chief Jung?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he asked, the members, who were each doing their own thing, answered at the same time,</p><br/><p>\u201cSnake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSnake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSnake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHamster.\u201d</p><br/><p>A commotion erupted in the waiting room. Shocked, Im Seoyoung jumped up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha, don\u2019t lie with such a brazen face! Euu\u2026 I got goosebumps!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not! The only thing Sunwoo oppa has in common with a hamster is that they are both mammals!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung shouted while rubbing her arms. Lee Taehee and LJ agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, a hamster is a bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Songha, do something about your eyes. Try taking them out and washing them. It\u2019s bad. It\u2019s not enough that you follow him around like a puppy, now you want to make him into a hamster and bring him around in your pocket?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sitting quietly, Lee Kwanwoo blinked.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was the hardest to talk to amongst the Neptune members. Compared to Im Seoyoung, whose friendliness rivaled that of the women\u2019s society president, Lee Taehee and LJ weren\u2019t on the friendly side either, but Lee Songha stood out.</p><br/><p>She already didn\u2019t look human, yet her expression barely changed as well. She didn\u2019t talk much and gave off a cool, calm feeling. Rather than feeling a gap between them, it felt like Lee Songha was in a different world.</p><br/><p>Yet, when they talked about Jung Sunwoo, her expression changed multiple times in a moment. She would even smile.</p><br/><p>A dramatic suspicion crossed his mind.</p><br/><p>A suspicion that maybe they were in <em>that</em> sort of relationship.</p><br/><p>However, his suspicion crumbled like a deflating balloon the next day.</p><br/><p>They were driving to a different film shoot. Instead of Jung Sunwoo, who had other things to do, Kim Hyunjo sat in the passenger\u2019s seat. While it wasn\u2019t on the same level as Jung Sunwoo, Kim Hyunjo\u2019s impression was quite bad as well. Kim Hyunjo told him,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are occasionally people who can\u2019t differentiate reality and drama, but don\u2019t even think about dating your assigned celebrities. If you\u2019re caught, you\u2019re fired. Even if you\u2019re really lucky, you\u2019ll be moved to another team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo made a throat-cutting gesture.</p><br/><p>Then he turned around and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou girls don\u2019t forget either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know, we know! Stop talking about it! You say it every time our manager changes!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Im Seoyoung shouted noisily, Kim Hyunjo smiled like the devil as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough even if I say it a hundred times. Succeed if you find it unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow successful do we have to be?! How successful?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you can tell the CEO to stop concerning himself with your personal life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to keep us single forever?!\u201d</p><br/><p>During this commotion, the other girls joined in as well. Only Lee Songha was quiet. Lee Kwanwoo glanced at Lee Songha. She had her chin propped up on her arm, which was on the windowsill, as she looked outside. She was eating almonds.</p><br/><p>If there was something going on between her and Jung Sunwoo, then there should have been some sort of reaction, yet she was calm. Same as usual. She didn\u2019t look even slightly interested in the dating discussion.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo erased the various dramas between a celebrity and her manager that he had come up with last night. Then he thought,</p><br/><p>\u2018Like Kim Hyunjo said, dramas were dramas, and reality was reality.\u2019</p><br/><p>His thoughts shook once more the next morning.</p><br/><p>The Neptune members, who finished their morning workout in the gym attached to the company, were spread out, exhausted. When Lee Kwanwoo was handing each of them a sports drink, an unfamiliar voice approached from the locker room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Jung Sunwoo from Team 3. Apparently, he\u2019s close with Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you hear that nonsense? I heard something happened to them and now they\u2019re practically enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the same, but they saved each other\u2019s phone numbers on their phone and call each other casually. For Son Chaeyoung, that\u2019s really close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Who told you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not one or two people who witnessed their call. That\u2019s why Team 2 is trying to assign Son Chaeyoung to Jung Sunwoo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The chatting men swallowed their words when they discovered Neptune. When they left to changing room with quick steps, silence hung in the air where the members were. A silence, which prickled as though they were rubbing their skin on broken china.</p><br/><p>The moment Lee Kwanwoo added Son Chaeyoung\u2019s name to his information on Chief Jung Sunwoo, Im Seoyoung glanced at Lee Songha as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, that is the most baseless rumor amongst all the nonsensical rumors I\u2019ve heard. Sunwoo oppa hates Son Chaeyoung so much. I bet he hates her more than we, no, Songha, you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other girls supported her, but the mood was gradually becoming odder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, how annoying! Let\u2019s just ask Sunwoo oppa out right!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Im Seoyoung\u2019s lead, the other members got up and left. Lee Songha also trailed along behind them. They didn\u2019t need to search for long. Jung Sunwoo was on the phone, standing on the stairs outside the gym.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, did you just wake up? There\u2019s food in the fridge, so eat some before you leave. There\u2019s only going to be lunchboxes or kimbap on set anyways, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Neptune members stood rigidly.</p><br/><p>Their faces, as they looked at Jung Sunwoo, turned strange. Discovering them after, Jung Sunwoo immediately hung up. A troubled expression flashed on his cold face. Frowning, he approached them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand what you might be thinking, but it\u2019s not my girlfriend. While I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m explaining myself, it\u2019s not. Just an actor. After reading scenarios together last night, we ended up sleeping at my house.\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words, the girls\u2019 expressions became odder.</p><br/><p>As if there was no other alternative, Jung Sunwoo clicked his tongue and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I thought you, especially Songha, would be concerned about this, I wanted to tell you when the time was right. To be honest, I\u2019ve been assigned to another actor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo unconsciously looked at Lee Songha. Then he saw it.</p><br/><p>The intense change in her expression that looked like a tornado had been tossed onto a calm lake.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> ~$31.8 million USD</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-108\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 108\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-110\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 110\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201331\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

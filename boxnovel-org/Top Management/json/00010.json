Even I strained my ears to listen to the small voice.</p><br/><p>-Uh\u2026 Hoooo, is this Hyunjo?</p><br/><p>It was the management team 3 leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung! What did you do all this time? I thought you guys drank too much and were knocked out on the streets!\u201d</p><br/><p>-Hey, hey, it just ended. I think I\u2019m going to die. These not-so-young-anymore men drank like they were trying to fill a bottomless pit. Their liver is better than mine.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? What happened in the meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard someone gulp their saliva. Was it me?</p><br/><p>-We decided to do it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Really?!\u201d</p><br/><p>-Tomorrow\u2026 Oh, it\u2019s today. Articles will be released soon.</p><br/><p>I clenched a fist on top of my knee. If I didn\u2019t, I might have yelled.</p><br/><p>I wonder how the conversation went for them to agree so easily?</p><br/><p>-The CEO pushed for it really hard. And we were lucky. There was a group that the staff dropped in the end, but they just got an overseas schedule. Their director came over and made a mess and everything. If the timing was even a bit off, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to get it. Who was that guy, the Lucky Charm who got this? That guy really did something big.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s really been decided?\u201d</p><br/><p>-We haven\u2019t officially signed yet, but it\u2019s already decided.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! The girls would love to hear this.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yeah, they must have had a hard time up until now so quickly tell them the good news. We got the chance, how popular they become all depend on you guys.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Do a good job.</p><br/><p>Hyunjo talked with the management team 3 leader for a long time afterwards before hanging up. Then he used his phone for a bit before handing it to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere. Take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I accepted the phone without thinking, I saw that it was dialing Lee Taehee.</p><br/><p>Why did he give this to me?</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo was the one to grab this chance, so you be the one to tell them. Before they release the articles.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ringing stopped and a sleepy voice answered.</p><br/><p>-Did something happen? We don\u2019t have anything scheduled today.</p><br/><p>It was Taehee.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, I\u2019m Jung Sunwoo. I have something to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I raised my head, I saw Hyunjo and the traitor looking at me expectedly. Hyunjo motioned to quickly tell them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you happen to know the new program that\u2019s about to start on Knet?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes. I\u2019ve heard of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune\u2019s going to appear on that.\u201d</p><br/><p>-\u2026Sorry?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe program on Knet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-No, I did hear it properly\u2026 is it true? I heard that they had already cast everyone and had finished their photo shoots for the poster\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. One of the girl groups had to leave, so Neptune was chosen to replace them. The chief wanted me to tell you guys before they released the articles\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very noisy at the other end of the phone. It seemed like Taehee woke everyone up to tell them the news. I could hear the \u2018Kyah\u2019 \u2018Kyah\u2019 screams. It was Seoyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it here for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo grabbed the phone and pressed the record button.</p><br/><p>The loud noises of girls chatting. Close to tears, cries of excitement. Various sounds were recorded. It wasn\u2019t even a video call, yet I could imagine what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you record\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere might a use for it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>To even think of the future at a moment like this, I had to learn this as well.</p><br/><p>Seoyoung, who was close to crying, kept asking if it was real and after constantly confirming that it was, I passed the phone to Hyunjo. He gave them a few words of caution before hanging up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, how do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>How do I feel?</p><br/><p>How should I explain it? When the girls were so happy they were about to cry, at that moment, I felt\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel proud\u2026 And satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like that when you are taking care of new groups. The feeling of their increasing number of regular programs. The rise in people who recognize them and their fans. The pleasure you feel knowing that you built this up. If you get addicted to it, you will never be able to stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we all get up now? We have to rest to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>We grabbed all our things and got up.</p><br/><p>While Hyunjo was paying the bill, we were waiting outside. I didn\u2019t know if it was the alcohol, but the wind didn\u2019t seem that cold. Ring, I heard the sound of bells ringing and Hyunjo opened the door.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, my vision went dark.</p><br/><p>Again.</p><br/><p>I was in my future office again. As soon as I realized this fact, I concentrated my eyes and ears. The things I see and hear here could change my life. I can\u2019t even ignore the smallest detail.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou started with Next K-Star and now, 20 years later, you became the CEO of a company with a worldwide network.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. I still have more to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour first experience was with Neptune and Next K-Star; did they influence your actions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter Song asked. My future self pondered for a bit. For a while, I only saw the body below my neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Because I got addicted then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAddicted\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pleasure of watching someone grow. That time, even though I only dug my own grave and didn\u2019t contribute much, I still felt that way. Neptune was unknown, but through their appearance on Next K-Star, their popularity rose quickly. Although they did receive a lot of insults\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I look at it now, it seemed like just a passing rain shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hoped he would talk more specifically on why Neptune received insults, but the topic quickly changed. Damn.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd their next album did really well and they even received first place on a music program. I received a lot of pleasure watching their progress from the sidelines. If I didn\u2019t experience that then, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been the person I am today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good. Neptune\u2019s next album will be a hit. Although it gets me that they received insults, it seemed the end result was good.</p><br/><p>\u201cI used to listen to the song a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>The quietly listening Director Park added in.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was Neptune\u2019s first hit song and it is still the first song you think of when you remember Neptune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems to have been a good song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t listened to it before? Ah\u2026 Right, it\u2019s an old song for Reporter Song. The song was really good. It really matched well with Neptune as well. I miss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we listen to the song while we continue? It\u2019s been a while for me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>As my future self spoke, I suddenly heard a clear, vivid song.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, are you drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>I abruptly awoke from the music.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you staring so intently at the floor? Do you feel like you\u2019re going to throw up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo patted my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem weak to alcohol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not drunk. I was just thinking of something\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly showed him my clear eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. From now on, you\u2019ll be drinking more often.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, both of you did well today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, thank you for your hard work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a safe trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor and I grabbed a taxi. Hyunjo said while getting in the taxi first.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s 5 right now, go home and rest well. Eat something good in the morning and be at work by 8.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did I hear it wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201cBy what time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy 8. If we want to write a press release in time, we need to have a meeting with the PR team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we got a regular program, we will much busier starting tomorrow. But once you get used to the work, you guys can work together and help each other out, so don\u2019t get too scared. Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>A devil. There\u2019s a devil here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen see you tomorrow. Don\u2019t disappear on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo left with a smiling face. The traitor and I looked at each other silently. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he was a backstabber who was completely different inside from his outward appearance, I might have felt a much deeper comradery.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo home safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took an empty taxi after we went our separate ways. I didn\u2019t know if the taxi had a drunk client before me, but the car smelled of vomit. I rolled down the windows, but it suddenly started to rain.</p><br/><p>The taxi quickly arrived at my one-room apartment. I paid the driver and received a receipt. Just in case I could file it under company expenses.</p><br/><p>As the rain dripped down on me, I made my way up to my cramped room. It was somehow already past 6 a.m. I had to get to work by 8. I guess I can sleep for 30 minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>However, after washing then lying on my bed, I couldn\u2019t sleep. My exhausted body was stretched out on my bed, but my mind was as awake as ever.</p><br/><p>Eventually, I got up and turned on my laptop. I paused briefly on the search engine. What should I search\u2026 Yeah.</p><br/><p>[I got a supernatural ability.]Movies, dramas and anything related to supernatural abilities appeared on the screen until I found one that was like what I was looking for. A question asked by a person claiming he had a supernatural ability. I read, half in doubt, but found that he was in a similar situation to me.</p><br/><p>It was a concern on whether he should continue to hide his power he received one day in a dream or use it to help others.</p><br/><p>Was this really real?</p><br/><p>I examined the page with expectation, but found that it was under the humor category of the forums. Damn. All the comments were of ridicule and mockery and some even suggested a hospital.</p><br/><p>[Power of foresight] [Real Supernatural Being]I gave up after searching a few more times. I felt like I would get a mental disorder.</p><br/><p>I rolled around my cramped one-room. There was only me. No one would know if I did something weird, right?</p><br/><p>Now then\u2026</p><br/><p>What do I have to do to use this power at will?</p><br/><p>There was no user\u2019s manual and there was no one I could ask. If I asked, I would probably be recommended to a mental hospital as well. Finding out for myself was the only way.</p><br/><p>First, I concentrated as I closed my eyes. I tried my best to recall the future I saw. Although I was frowning weirdly and concentrating to a point I was about make a weird noise, there was not even the slightest change.</p><br/><p>I quit after trying for a countless number of times. This meant one of two things.</p><br/><p>Either I was unable to figure out the method to use my power or the power was not something I could use whenever I wanted to and randomly occurred.</p><br/><p>If I found a method to control my power, I was going to check what the next lottery numbers were\u2026</p><br/><p>I opened up a notepad and recorded all the information I heard and saw.</p><br/><p>The distant future me was the CEO of a management company. One that was quite successful. It seemed like I was acquainted with Director Park who came for the interview. From Reporter Song\u2019s words, I seemed to have obtained my position as the CEO of a major management company through my persistent efforts. Recalling how he said how the door of hardship was opened wide, it really seemed like I didn\u2019t succeed easily.</p><br/><p>First, I didn\u2019t get assigned to an actor like I wanted, but to Neptune. Neptune appeared on Next K-Star and from the initial success, it would be greenlit for more seasons.</p><br/><p>Neptune received insults from appearing on the show, however, in the end, their popularity rose. Their next album was a big hit and they placed first in a music broadcast.</p><br/><p>Remembering how future me said that it was the start of a relationship with Neptune, it seemed like I would continue to have more relations with them\u2026</p><br/><p>And Gunyoung was the bastard who backstabbed me.</p><br/><p>Was there anything else? Ah, one more. I deducted I was single in the future as I didn\u2019t have a ring on my ring finger. It was either I was unmarried even at forty or I was divorced. I couldn\u2019t tell which one was worse.</p><br/><p>This was all the information I collected from seeing the future three times.</p><br/><p>Wait, but\u2026</p><br/><p>I changed the present. Instead of getting backstabbed by the traitor, I was the one who became the Lucky Charm as the one who connected Producer Joontae with Neptune.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, the future changed?</p><br/><p>When looking at the butterfly effect in movies and dramas, the flutter of a butterfly\u2019s wings caused a giant hurricane. What if my actions yesterday were like the fluttering of wings?</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t stop me from becoming a CEO in the future, right?</p><br/><p>No, after seeing the future the first and second time, I had already changed the present. In the future, they said Hyunjo didn\u2019t have a favourable first impression of me so the door of hardship was opened, however, due to me selling out the quadruplets, I was able to fix that. The Lucky Charm title that the traitor, who backstabbed me, took also belonged to me now. Even though the present changed significantly, I didn\u2019t notice any signs of the butterfly effect in the future the second and third time.</p><br/><p>Then was it\u2026 something like a parallel universe?</p><br/><p>The future I saw and the present I am currently in have already split into two.</p><br/><p>I searched parallel universe on the internet. An incredible amount of information popped up. I changed my posture and started to read it.</p><br/><p>However, like a side effect, sleepiness started to overcome me after reading for a short while. I shook my head in an attempt to keep myself awake. I would have to get ready for work soon.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t be the new recruit who was late on his second day of work\u2026</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-9\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 9\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-11\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 11\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201132\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

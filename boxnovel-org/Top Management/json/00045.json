There are three laptops. We also checked the wi-fi.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor said as he pointed to the laptops spread out in the living room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are the girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s fine except Seoyoung, who\u2019s uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m fine too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung protested fiercely at my words. When I turned around, she was tightly clenching her phone and looking in my direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re fine, put your phone down. You\u2019ve been refreshing entertainment news for an hour now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey might put something up. I can\u2019t be at ease if I don\u2019t check!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you call being uneasy, you dummy.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ smirked. The other three had set chicken and other snacks on the table in the living room and were sitting, waiting for Next K-Star to begin.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo placed the shopping bag he brought on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cYounghoon hyung gave this to me. He said it was precious and to only drink it if we hit a peak of at least 1.5% in viewership ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecious? What is it? Alcohol?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWine?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the girls\u2019 gazes gathered on the bag with curious eyes, Kim Hyunjo brought out the object inside the bag. I glanced at it as well. A glass cylindrical bottle, around 40cm tall. It had leaves, whose color had faded white, and thumb-width roots dangling below.</p><br/><p>I felt like I had seen it before.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNatural wild ginseng wine. He said he personally dug and fermented them. Younghoon hyung\u2019s hands were trembling when he gave this to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the girls\u2019 faces indicated they weren\u2019t interested. It may be a precious, invigorating alcohol to some, but to girls in their early twenties, it was simply an expensive root-soaked soju<sup>{1}</sup>. The wild ginseng wine bitterly made its exit off the table.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo glanced at the clock on the wall and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are 30 minutes left. Did you all contact your families?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already did. My mom said that she even had my aunts come over to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung replied, trying hard to calm down. Lee Taehee and LJ nodded their heads in affirmation. The only one who didn\u2019t reply was Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, why didn\u2019t you tell your family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was scolded a lot in the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said flatly while hugging a bag of chips.</p><br/><p>I suddenly recalled what Lee Songha said before. She had told me her parents opposed her becoming a celebrity, asking her why she continued doing something that wasn\u2019t working out. That she didn\u2019t call them ever since their previous album flunked.</p><br/><p>Considering her situation, I understood why she couldn\u2019t tell her family. Since she was the only one who received the judges\u2019 criticism during the recording of their first mission. Perhaps it was because of this, but the expression she had while waiting for the broadcast seemed more placid than the others.</p><br/><p>Vrrr.</p><br/><p>My phone was vibrating endlessly for a while now. My parents back home and my brother\u2019s family were sitting in front of the TV. My friends said they were at a pub, waiting for the broadcast, and even sent me a photo as proof.</p><br/><p>This time, it was a message from Reporter Park Woojeong.</p><br/><p>-I am waiting after finishing my preparations to write an article! My senior who came back from Knet said that he heard the first broadcast will focus on Neptune. I will publish a great article as repayment for last time!</p><br/><p>\u201cChief. I received a message from a reporter I know, and she said that she heard the first broadcast of Next K-Star will focus on Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and the girls quickly turned to look at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that true? Really? Do you think it\u2019s true, oppa?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Im Seoyoung\u2019s hurried urging, Kim Hyunjo licked his lips and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s from a reporter, then it\u2019s not like it doesn\u2019t have any credibility. They say Knet holds a preview screening of edited program broadcasts with around twenty people. Someone among them might have let it slip.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood inside surged. I thanked Reporter Park Woojeong and sat in front of my assigned laptop. I had even registered on a membership forum bustling with elementary, middle and high schoolers for this day.</p><br/><p>When I glanced through it, there wasn\u2019t much of a reaction yet. Since even I, who knew that Next K-Star would get great viewership ratings through my foresight, was nervous, there was nothing more to say about the others. With thick wrinkles drawn on their foreheads, the traitor and Kim Hyunjo each moved their own mice.</p><br/><p>Of course, the most serious person was Im Seoyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do? Someone posted a comment \u2018Anyone waiting for Next K-Star\u2019s first broadcast?\u2019 on the forum, and it hasn\u2019t had a reply for 11 minutes! Should I leave a reply? I shouldn\u2019t, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGunyoung\u2026 No, I feel like you\u2019re going to have it snatch right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Kim Hyunjo\u2019s words, the traitor smiled, revealing an awkward expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunwoo. Take her phone from her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I snatched Im Seoyoung\u2019s phone from her hands. Im Seoyoung clung on my leg like an addict experiencing withdrawal symptoms.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ah, oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust watch TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only hold it and not look at it! No, I\u2019ll only check once every minute!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re heartless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a heart. Now go watch TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>I firmly pointed at the TV.</p><br/><p>While we were chatting to calm our nervousness, the minute hand continued to move without stopping.</p><br/><p>Then, 11:12 p.m.</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah, it\u2019s starting. It\u2019s starting! Ah, I\u2019m so nervous, I can\u2019t watch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, be quiet. Or I\u2019m going to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The first broadcast of Next K-Star, which we had been waiting for for a long time, began.</p><br/><p>Neptune was the focus of the broadcast.</p><br/><p>In a bad way.</p><br/><p>From the start, each team quickly made their appearance one after another, then suddenly, when it was finally Neptune\u2019s turn, a video of Lemon Girls appeared.</p><br/><p>The broadcast revealed that they were a team who was originally cast for Next K-Star, even kindly explaining they were dropped due to public criticism from the DUI incident. Then they filled the screen with headlines and internet comments that appeared the day Neptune was cast.</p><br/><p>{Who is \u2018Neptune\u2019 who is replacing Lemon Girls on Next K-Star?}</p><ul><li>A team I haven\u2019t heard or seen before suddenly popped out. It looks like the staff were really in a hurry hahaha</li><li>An article that they were cast came out immediately after the article about Lemon Girls dropping out. What the? I\u2019m at loss for words.</li><li>They are from W&amp;U. I\u2019m 100% certain their company put them on the show.</li></ul><br/><p>Then the video of the first time they met and the audio from interviews with other teams meshed together.</p><br/><p>\u2018No one knew who they were. Everyone was like, \u2018Who are they? Do you know them?\u2019 and then, when someone said that they were from W&amp;U, everyone was like, \u2018Ahhh\u2026\u2019\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Did they get preferential treatment because they were from a big company?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t everyone think that? Ah, I don\u2019t think this is right\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Neptune\u2019s interview appeared the next moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Five out of the seven teams chose Neptune for last place.\u2019</p><br/><p>A still of Im Seoyoung\u2019s stiffening face as she heard Producer Go Joontae\u2019s words was captured.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>A chill blew in the room. It was expected. Since the broadcast was edited with the obvious intention of creating conflict between Neptune and the other teams.</p><br/><p>Even afterwards, the broadcast progressed in an unfavorable direction for Neptune. Reactions from community sites began to show up, but the majority of comments about Neptune were negative.</p><ul><li>Just looking at them, I can tell they are girls pushing their looks. Why are they on this program when they don\u2019t have any popularity or skill?</li><li>Aren\u2019t they embarrassed appearing there when there are a lot of new groups who have the potential of becoming true K-pop stars?</li><li>If it was going to be like this, why did they call it \u2018Next K-Star\u2019? A shame to the country.</li><li>As expected of Knet, I smell another devil\u2019s edit<sup>{2}</sup> hahaha They just sacrificed a girl group.</li><li>It\u2019s not a devil\u2019s edit. Those girls deserve heaps of criticisms. Extremely disgusting.</li><li>Although they started mildly, they are getting heated reactions with this. They brought them in aiming for this. To use them to make the program a hot topic right from the start.</li></ul><br/><p>It was a relief I took Im Seoyoung\u2019s phone from her.</p><br/><p>When I sighed, the traitor poked my side. Then mouthed, \u2018How is it on your end?\u2019. I shook my head in reply. When I asked, \u2018How about you?\u2019 he briefly clicked his tongue and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Well, if the tame community sites were like this, then internet and social media comments would be much cruder. I could picture it already. I glanced at Kim Hyunjo, and his expression looking at his screen was dark as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have told my mom\u2026 I told her to watch for no reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung murmured with a depressed voice before burying her face in her knees. LJ was glancing at the TV while punching a cushion, and Lee Songha\u2019s hand gradually became faster as it went in and out of the chip bag.</p><br/><p>The only one who kept her calm was Lee Taehee\u2026 was what I thought, but she wordlessly opened the wild ginseng wine and started to drink it with a beer mug.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo roughly tangled up his hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait a little longer. The mission went well. It might end in a twist after progressing like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor and I both nodded our heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the staff was in a hurry. They dissed themselves while bringing up these comments. If you look at it that way, then there\u2019s a high chance that it\u2019ll end in a twist like chief says.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd dramatic broadcasts usually do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still, the mood wouldn\u2019t get better easily. Eventually, we, obviously including the girls, poured the strong wild ginseng wine down our throats without any snacks. In a grim voice and after drinking several glasses consecutively, Kim Hyunjo declared he would kill Producer Go Joontae if the program ended like this.</p><br/><p>Soon, the mission performances began.</p><br/><p>The performances with no instrumentals were followed by the judges\u2019 unbridled compliments and criticisms. In the viewer\u2019s perspective, the broadcast was so exciting that they couldn\u2019t take their eyes off it. The reactions on the internet gradually grew until it exploded when it was Sugar Cats\u2019 turn.</p><br/><p>Then, we saw Neptune get up on the stage.</p><br/><p>Yeah, there will definitely be a twist. Since it was a great performance, no matter who saw it.</p><br/><p>But, what should I do if they only showed a tiny bit of their performance and cut to the criticism about Lee Songha? Don\u2019t tell me that the thing I heard from my foresight that made Neptune receive criticisms is this?</p><br/><p>My throat felt parched.</p><br/><p>Accompanied by a tense BGM, the targeted comments from other teams, which appeared in the beginning, were inserted once more before Neptune\u2019s performance began. Up until then, my shoulders were tense and rigid due to nervousness.</p><br/><p>However, the moment Lee Taehee\u2019s voice flowed out of the speakers.</p><br/><p>My nervousness relaxed like it was never there.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only me. The depressing mood that hung densely in the living room was washed away in an instant. Everyone was dazed at first, then absent-minded before finally looking at the TV with relieved expressions.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung broke the silence with a dazed voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Aren\u2019t we doing well? Right? It\u2019s not coming out all weird, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many seconds has it been? I think our performance is being shown the longest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhh, what do we do? We\u2019re getting tons of close-ups as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls\u2019 performance and the cuts to the surprised reactions of the judges and members of other teams who were watching from the seats intensified the exhilarating sense of pleasure felt from the twist.</p><br/><p>Neptune\u2019s performance was shown longer and was more successful than any other team.</p><br/><p>Vrrr!</p><br/><p>My phone, which had been silent throughout the broadcast, vibrated.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Korean alcohol.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> I don\u2019t believe I explained this before, but devils\u2019 edit/ devil\u2019s editing process is when the staff is purposefully editing a broadcast to put someone in a bad light.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-44\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 44\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-46\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 46\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201202\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

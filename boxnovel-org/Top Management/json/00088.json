It seemed he was on a call as his phone was stuck next to his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Reporter Min. Look into it for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After ending the call, he looked back and forth between Team Leader Park and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear about Lee Joohwan\u2019s relationship with a girl? Did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When we looked at him blankly, Kim Hyunjo said in a frustrated manner,</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that that bastard was seeing another girl? I hear she\u2019s a non-celebrity. Reporter Min says that since the story is so detailed, it\u2019s pretty much a fact. Apparently, G-Today holds the information. Sunwoo, don\u2019t you have a reporter you\u2019re close with there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I replied, Kim Hyunjo slapped my back and urged,</p><br/><p>\u201cCall her and ask. You have to use your connections at a time like this or when else would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Hyunjo, don\u2019t be so hasty and have a seat. Calm down a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park pointed to an empty seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I look like I can calm down right now? When a rabid dog is causing a fuss? Wait, if you\u2019re telling me not to be hasty, that means you\u2019ve already heard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, who had been talking with a frown, paused before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, why are the two of you like that? Team leader, why are you so calm? Not long ago, you were going berserk, asking where Lee Joohwan was and how simply screwing him over wouldn\u2019t be enough, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park looked at me and smiled brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk Mr. Sunwoo. Mr. Sunwoo made a great contribution today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA great contribution? What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo completely submerged Lee Joohwan in shit. We now only need to take him out and fry him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo looked at me with a perplexed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, listen to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without tiring my mouth from explaining, I handed Kim Hyunjo my phone. Then I played an audio recording. The audio recording contained the conversation I had with Lee Joohwan on the phone.</p><br/><p>As soon as he heard Lee Joohwan\u2019s voice, Kim Hyunjo\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Lee Joohwan? That bastard picked up his phone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust listen to it, Mr. Hyunjo. Then your mind will be at peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo hesitantly took a seat. Lee Joohwan and my voice played out in silence. Kim Hyunjo\u2019s face gradually turned strange, and he even started staring at me intensely.</p><br/><p>I avoided his gaze with a cough since I wasn\u2019t used to threatening someone then listening to the recorded threat with others. No, wouldn\u2019t it be a problem if I got used to it?</p><br/><p>With a thrilled expression, Team Leader Park said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the climax.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Umm. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll take it down right away. The post. I made a mistake while drunk.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lee Joohwan\u2019s excuse was smeared with anxiety and confusion.</p><br/><p>Even though it was her second time listening to it, Team Leader Park\u2019s reaction was outstanding. Should I say it looked like she had downed a beer in one shot?</p><br/><p>\u201cSend me this. I need to save it on my phone and listen to it when I need to calm my heart. It has an immediate effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>I readily nodded my head at Team Leader Park\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, who now had an expression similar to Team Leader Park, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet his company is in mayhem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis post on social media was brought down right away. They are probably wracking their brains trying to deal with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Kim Hyunjo gave me a strange look once again. Then, with a laugh, he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy\u2019s talented, isn\u2019t he? You\u2019re even better than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I smiled without replying, Kim Hyunjo patted my back.</p><br/><p>With a relaxed expression, he told Team Leader Park,</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking about how this was a bolt out of the blue, but if it\u2019s like this, things should blow over without any damage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just let things blow over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not wearing any makeup, Team Leader Park\u2019s lips became crooked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he\u2019s already pulled Lee Songha into this, even if he takes his post down and explains, there will be a lot of people who won\u2019t believe it and will think that we pressured him. Elementary and middle schoolers ignore facts and believe in whatever they want to believe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, if we want to make this situation advantageous for us, let\u2019s make Lee Joohwan a true bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, my blank phone vibrated. It was Reporter Park Woojeong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, reporter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park and Kim Hyunjo\u2019s gazes were locked on me. Their gazes contained a strange excitement. Reporter Park Woojeong\u2019s voice from the other side was also quite excited</p><br/><p>-Mr. Sunwoo, I found her. I found that woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did? Already?\u201d</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t even been that long since I told Reporter Park Woojeong.</p><br/><p>Even the police wouldn\u2019t be able to find their suspect this fast.</p><br/><p>-My colleague helped me. Since this didn\u2019t involve a celebrity couple but was a scandal involving an idol and a non-celebrity, he wouldn\u2019t have helped out normally but said it would be interesting if we pulled Lee Songha into the story as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>-We checked people associated with Punchline members. Though they swore at us since we woke them up early in the morning. After snooping around knowing her appearance, occupation, and name, we found her in no time. We already talked to her on the phone as well.</p><br/><p>I was really surprised this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou even talked to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>-The bar she works at opens until 4 a.m. Also\u2026</p><br/><p>After pausing for a moment, Reporter Park Woojeong said in an excited voice.</p><br/><p>-We confirmed the facts after saying we would compensate her. Now we just need to write an article.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>There was still a lot of time before the day brightened.</p><br/><p>The Punchline members, who had been taking a nap, were forced awake and were sitting in the living room. They sighed out of frustration and gulped down cold water. They also stared at Lee Joohwan mumbling on the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, if you\u2019re going to do something, do it properly. What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do if our team image becomes bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, that foolish son of a bitch. Preventing us from sleeping by causing a ruckus so early in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re loud! I\u2019m already pissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Lee Joohwan spoke out impulsively, the Punchline members, who were familiar with his personality, ignored him as if he was a barking dog.</p><br/><p>Scratching his head aggressively, Lee Joohwan swore.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherfucker, this was definitely a foolproof plan. My popularity would rise, and I would knock Lee Songha off her high horse as well. It was pure genius. Fuck. That manager bastard, I didn\u2019t like him during the recording, but in the end\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He vented his anger by kicking the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Joohwan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief, who had constantly been on the phone in another room, rushed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why? What is it now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou called that Hyesung or whatever and handled things properly, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw me talk with her a while ago. I told her to keep her mouth shut since reporters might call her.\u201d</p><br/><p>With an uneasy expression, the chief said,</p><br/><p>\u201cCall her again. I heard some strange information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s so head over heels for me that she won\u2019t say anything if I tell her not to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grumbling, Lee Joohwan called her.</p><br/><p>However, after ringing for a minute, it went to her voicemail.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, why isn\u2019t she picking up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she answering on purpose? Send her a text.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you she\u2019s not. She\u2019s probably busy. Just wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second, third, and even the tenth call.</p><br/><p>The destination of the attempted calls was her voicemail. Lee Joohwan, who had boasted that there was no way she would talk during the first few attempts, grounded his teeth after the fifth. His face was distorted and his cheeks convulsed subtly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? What is she doing that she\u2019s not answering her phone?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this won\u2019t do. You can\u2019t have a scandal with a non-celebrity. Doing noise marketing by pulling a hot topic maker like Lee Songha in and being exposed in a scandal with a non-celebrity are completely different! Your fans will all leave! And if they mention the post you wrote\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherfucker, it\u2019s her voicemail again! Where the fuck does she put her phone?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both had anxious expressions and they said whatever was on their mind.</p><br/><p>Lee Joohwan shook his leg restlessly as he made his umpteenth attempt.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, hyung, hyung! There\u2019s an article!\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest member, who had been on his tablet, shouted.</p><br/><p>Everyone was gathered in front of the tablet in an instant. While multiple pairs of eyes read the article, a suffocating silence hung in the living room.</p><br/><p>His face ashen, Lee Joohwan opened and closed his mouth.</p><br/><p>The chief rushed into another room while holding his vibrating phone.</p><br/><p>Then the main vocalist of the group glanced at Lee Joohwan before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really fucked.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if this was a signal, Lee Joohwan began swearing loudly.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The sky was unusually clear and fair.</p><br/><p>Since so many things occurred during the night, I was sleep deprived, but my mood was as bright as the sky.</p><br/><p>Holding bagels and coffee I bought at a nearby caf\u00e9, I entered Neptune\u2019s residence. The girls gathered in on the rug in the living room looked at me.</p><br/><p>Although I told them that things ended well early morning, they looked terrible, clearly having spent the night awake.</p><br/><p>With sunken eyes like a zombie\u2019s, Im Seoyoung staggered her way towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpppaaa, just what happened last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot happened last night. But why are you girls like that? Did you not sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung gulped down her saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We were readying our hearts because we thought a storm was coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough a storm did come, it passed by us.\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered with a grin. Only then did Im Seoyoung\u2019s complexion brighten.</p><br/><p>LJ, who had been tapping at her laptop on one side of the rug, smirked as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat storm, it seems it went to Punchline. There\u2019s a huge fuss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, it did deal a strong blow to Punchline.</p><br/><p>While netizens with nothing to do were spreading screenshots of Lee Joohwan\u2019s post and driving Lee Songha into a corner, G-Today took the post and released an exclusive article that included Lee Joohwan\u2019s date.</p><br/><p>Follow-up and aggregate articles were published after that. Like how Team Leader Park intended, Lee Joohwan\u2019s image completely went to shit and many fans who called him \u2018our oppa\u2019 left him.</p><br/><p>Even though we didn\u2019t act, Lee Joohwan and his company desperately explained the post he had uploaded. Only then would he look a little less like trash. Either way; because of their explanation and Team Leader Park\u2019s media manipulation, those who were on a witch hunt against Lee Songha retreated.</p><br/><p>While the other girls were looking at the articles and comments about Lee Joohwan, I placed a bagel in front of Lee Songha. Then I asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you waiting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said while smiling brightly as the sky.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director scratched his chin while asking.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader and Chief Jo were sitting on the sofa across from him. After taking a sip of steaming tea, the team 2 leader spoke. The speech he had prepared to persuade the director flowed out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha, it\u2019s an important time for her right now. It\u2019s not rare for those who debut brilliantly with a successful first project and disappear after dull projects afterwards. If we want to take care of her properly from now on, it\u2019s better to assign a veteran to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, instead of Lucky Charm, she will be assigned to you, Chief Jo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director asked while blowing on his tea.</p><br/><p>Chief Jo, whose complexion had brightened a little, readily nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Chaeyoung\u2019s situation right now is a bit\u2026 There\u2019s no need for me to be in charge of her right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader added,</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha will be busier from now on, and if she wants to properly take steps into the drama and film world, a bunch of problems will crop up suddenly. We can\u2019t keep leaving it to Jung Sunwoo. Since Lee Bongjoon was there with him, there wasn\u2019t a problem with Cat Guardian Ghost, but he\u2019ll have to face problems by himself in the future. He\u2019s just a rookie with five months of experience, do you think he can handle it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you not hear about what happened last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director abruptly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw that Lee Songha\u2019s name was rising up and down in the articles\u2026 It didn\u2019t seem like a big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Chief Jo\u2019s reply, the director clicked his tongue and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what Team Leader Park says that Lucky Charm handled a scandal concerning Lee Songha that would have given us a rough time this early in the year. Considering he\u2019s a five-month rookie, he\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, still\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t incite someone who\u2019s doing his job properly and let him be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unsatisfied, the team 2 leader began to speak, but the director looked at Chief Jo as if he didn\u2019t need to hear any more.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, why are you guys acting like this? Chaeyoung pestered the CEO to assign Lucky Charm to her, and you want Lee Songha? If you really want to change who you\u2019re assigned to, then get Lee Songha\u2019s approval.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo, who had been sitting scrunched in his seat, suddenly raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you assign her to me if I persuade her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it if you get her approval.\u201d</p><br/><p>That night, Chief Jo called out to Lee Songha, who was exhausted from preparing for their next album in the basement practice room. Then they sat across from each other in a small meeting room. With a brightly smiling face, Chief Jo talked about the data he had prepared ahead of time.</p><br/><p>The conversation only went on for about ten minutes.</p><br/><p>After ten minutes, Lee Songha returned to the practice room with no change to her normal appearance. Chief Jo left the meeting room only after a long time had passed.</p><br/><p>From that day onwards, Chief Jo didn\u2019t bring up the topic of changing the celebrity he was in charge of.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-87\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 87\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-89\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 89\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201289\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

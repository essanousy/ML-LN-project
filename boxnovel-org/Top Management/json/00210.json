Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>My name was suddenly mentioned. It was too loud to consider it a whisper.</p><br/><p>The theatre company members, who were examining Chief Lee Kyojin and wondering if he was one of those common scammers, quickly turned to look at me. Thinking this would be fast, I took off my glasses and hat. I even took off the university jacket I used for my disguise. This was a bit of a shame. I felt younger with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes, hello\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The theatre members greeted me back before simultaneously reacting like they were on cue. I have become used this after my face became known, but it was strange considering it was actual actors reacting this way.</p><br/><p>A few more sociable members approached us.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a surprise! You really came regarding an audition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you shocked me. I was 80% sure that this was a scam!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for City Jungle, right? Mr. Nam Joyoon and Ms. Lee Songha as the leads. The film being made by SBE Film! I saw an announcement for supporting and minor roles on the community site, so I was thinking about sending in my profile or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin, who retreated back at some point, crossed his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It seems there is no need for any further explanation. This gives me a strange sense of shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup, who was leaning on one foot, tapped Nam Joyoon\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust take off your mask and hat. There\u2019s no point since no one can recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon took off his hat and mask as if he had been waiting for those words. The theatre members reacted even more loudly than before. Sort of like an idol holding a fan meeting? Their reaction was so cheerful and positive that it was strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe story behind you two is quite famous in our industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA story where an unknown actor meets a manager and they both support each other and succeed. It\u2019s romantic. I really hope you do well, Mr. Nam Joyoon. That way, people like us who threw away their lives to chase their dreams can continue with hope!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPark Hyejae! You become a film scene-stealer next year and get married!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following this mood, we ended up in a snack stall. After a round of drinks, the theatre members became even rowdier. The captain of the group placed his arm around Park Hyejae, who was drinking with a complicated face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard hasn\u2019t been able to get married for three years due to his to-be in-laws\u2019 refusal. That they couldn\u2019t give their daughter to a guy who can barely make ends meet acting in a small theatre company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it. That\u2019s not something to brag about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyejae looked at me and Chief Lee Kyojin before asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of role is it? Is it a minor one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a supporting role. There are a lot of lines, and it\u2019s a very important role.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll casting directors seem to say that though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyejae said bitterly at Chief Lee Kyojin\u2019s reply. The theatre members chimed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we have high hopes that it\u2019s a good role and go, there really are a lot of weird ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was tricked by a casting director and auditioned for an erotic film.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all so negative? There was one time when I was introduced to a really good role. I passed the audition and attended a reading session, but they told me to leave after casting an actor that was more famous than me. Bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTons of movies and dramas come out every quarter, so why aren\u2019t there any roles for me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s like how there are apartments everywhere, you can\u2019t afford one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The theatre members\u2019 lives were all dramatic. Dramas that kept twirling down with no end in sight. Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup joined in. Nam Joyoon\u2019s life\u2019s hardships didn\u2019t lose out to anyone. His life was a hardcore drama.</p><br/><p>Sitting with Park Hyejae, we talked to his agency and scheduled an audition date.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem to have much hope for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe saw hundreds of profile pictures again and again, and you stood out to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stopped his glass halfway at my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour acting skills were better than expected, and I could visualize the film scene in my head as I saw the play. Although you\u2019ll be confirmed after an official audition, I\u2019ll cheer for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyejae\u2019s neck reddened.</p><br/><p>The theatre members gave him \u2018energy\u2019 by shoving more boilermakers down his throat.</p><br/><p>We met multiple actors since that day.</p><br/><p>Some were recommended by Chief Lee Kyojin, and others stood out to me. Their charisma and skills were diverse. There were cases where I thought, \u2018that person\u2019s the one,\u2019 when I saw them act, and other times when I experienced shock and horror.</p><br/><p>There were a lot more of the latter. A lot more.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because she\u2019s nervous!\u201d</p><br/><p>The director of an acting school clung to Chief Lee Kyojin\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than being nervous, she was unbelievably confident. It\u2019s like she not even reading off actual literature but a children\u2019s book. Why did Director Yoon recommend someone like her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I haven\u2019t been learning for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female high schooler, whose terrible performance rivaled Im Seoyoung, defended herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t fully prepared for the audition. If you give me some more time to practice, I\u2019m confident I can act as good as Lee Songha unni! Also, to be honest, my face is better. She seems to benefit from the camera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, she had the looks! Her face doesn\u2019t lose out\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The director stopped talking.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who was standing there completely disguised as a film company employee, took off her hat. Her tied up hair fell loosely. After taking off her mask, her face was completely unveiled. The blankly staring director and high schooler shrunk back.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin came over and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, it seems that the director who recommended her to me is her relative or received something. That guy\u2026 What a loss of face after bringing Ms. Lee Songha all the way over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather, I think the student who acted as her counterpart was good. She had a good image too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You thought so too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Our gazes turned. The female student who played as the counterpart was sitting in a corner watching us. While eating a triangle kimbap. The next moment, she was coughing excessively after receiving Chief Lee Kyojin\u2019s business card and an audition offer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the ones who called for a replacement driver, correct? Where\u2019s your car?\u201d</p><br/><p>A man in his mid-twenties. His face had scars like he had been in fights. His punk-vibe face was quite good-looking, but his hoarse, glum voice was particularly impressive.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin chewed on a fry as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t bring a car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you kidding? Then why did you call for a replacement driver?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause we wanted to talk to you about an audition.\u201d</p><br/><p>The actor, who dazedly sat down in front of us, began pouring his heart about how shitty life was for having to chase auditions by day and work as a replacement driver at night.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I get a minor role, I get fired from part-time jobs where I have to be available at all times. I can endure all other things, but food is really\u2026 It makes me distressed. Sorry, but could I have a fry?\u201d</p><br/><p>After showing off his impromptu acting skills full of sincerity, he received Chief Lee Kyojin and my business cards and left.</p><br/><p>Clinking our glasses, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really are a lot of talented unknown actors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is still only the tip of the iceberg. I realized this while working in this industry, but if you want to become a star, you need both luck and opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin drank.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis project, I think its casting luck is quite good. Good acting skills are different from being suited for the role, but quite a few actors caught my eye. I was worried at first since they said that we would have to cast lesser-known actors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe decided to purposely fill our cast with new faces. To look refreshing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a risk. It can go one way or another.\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled the actors I met over the past few days as I drank.</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t bring SBE Film into the picture, there would have been no way Chief Lee Kyojin became the casting director. Meaning that the supporting role candidates I met these past few days were very likely to have had no relationship with City Jungle in the original future.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the casting.</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung and the project producer were working hard trying to bring on skilled staff, like cameramen and audio directors. If things go well, the resulted would be different from the original future.</p><br/><p>After veering from the path my future showed me, I stopped seeing any visions.</p><br/><p>Also, the present was constantly being changed.</p><br/><p>At a fast rate, like a tire rolling downhill.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The panel was put up in an area that was a mess for a while due to construction.</p><br/><p>W&amp;U Management Business Department Team 4.</p><br/><p>It was across from the PR Team\u2019s office on the fifth floor. I saw the team leader\u2019s office beside the company desks and partitions. I carefully opened the door. The office with a large desk and seats for guests was still empty.</p><br/><p>I sat down on a chair and looked around this unfamiliar space.</p><br/><p>Office.</p><br/><p>I mumbled in a quiet voice. I felt a strange sensation rise up within me from my toes. Although it was small compared to the office my future self had, it was the first personal office I received.</p><br/><p>Noises came in through my partly-opened door. Chief Lee Bongjoon and Chief Sung Uimin, as well as other members of the team, were unpacking their things. We decided early on to hold a get-together tonight. Moving day. It was a day worth celebrating.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam 4 Leader, when are you going to show us around?\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was lost in my emotions, the Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo suddenly walked in holding a box of tissues and a palm-sized cactus. The Team 3 Leader looked around with an investigative eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your view better than mine? It also gets a lot of sunlight. How odd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you clashed with the CEO, there were rumors that your office would be moved to the basement. That\u2019s why there were many people coveting this office. Anyways, don\u2019t make yourself a nameplate just yet since you don\u2019t know how things will unfold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you cursing him? Didn\u2019t the CEO move past it after saying that he would be waiting for the results?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt could be that he hasn\u2019t had much time to pay attention to him because he\u2019s focused on other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like the Team 3 Leader said, CEO Baek Hansung and the director rarely showed up at the company these days. They were busy going to China and the US. Seeing as they frequented Los Angeles, it looked like they were working on trying to get a foothold in Hollywood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are agency and contract problems as well. Also, problems with investors. They probably have a lot of things to handle right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader clicked his tongue before changing the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s City Jungle? Are things going well? Articles about you pop up regularly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start filming as soon as we finish auditioning. Songha and Joyoon hyung are busy training with a martial artist director and coordinating with each other. Any moment now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t turn back anymore. You better succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The timing will be the worst if you fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, the door burst open.</p><br/><p>Then Chief Lee Bongjoon stuck his head in.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, can you come out and watch the TV?\u201d</p><br/><p>Employees were already crowding around the large TV in the lounge.</p><br/><p>It was airing a show that briefed people on gossip in the entertainment world like tabloids. I saw people coming out of the airport through the shaking camera. Security guards, managers, staff, and actors completely disguised with sunglasses and hats.</p><br/><p>They were all W&amp;U actors who knocked on the door to Hollywood.</p><br/><p>The panelists were making a fuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a hot video we just received. Their official return date was tomorrow, right? What do you think is the reason for the actors to secretly return early?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Of course, it\u2019s to avoid media attention. There were a lot of fans hoping the actors would make a glorious return after becoming world stars, but in the end, they ended up returning with embarrassing results.</p><br/><p>The screen replayed the actors\u2019 backs. Their past interview clips and pictures appeared on the screen in the middle. The way the edited the picture of actors waving their hands as they left confidently and their current return felt almost malicious.</p><br/><p>The employees\u2019 gazes alternated between the TV and their phones as they murmured,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe company was supposed to not tell anyone and have them return quietly, so how did they know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, wow. There are tons of articles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we expected the media to cause a commotion, they just can\u2019t wait to get their hands on it, can they?\u201d</p><br/><p>I checked articles on my phone. Provocative headlines already messily filled the news column. There were two key phrases.</p><br/><p>Despair of Entering Hollywood. Embarrassing Return.</p><br/><p>There were a few W&amp;U actors who tried to become world stars. There were only three who didn\u2019t fall off and held on. There were even actors who were considered at the top of the country amongst them. These were actors who made you think that they could work in the US with their skillset.</p><br/><p>As the company poured money to promote them, they appeared on quite a few Hollywood works. They also poured tons of money into promotional activities in the country whenever a film or a drama pilot was released.</p><br/><p>Appearing on blockbusters with budgets of hundreds of millions of US dollars. Coordination with famous Hollywood actors.</p><br/><p>However, the results were always below our expectations.</p><br/><p>-Entering Hollywood\u2019s market was W&amp;U\u2019s internal project.</p><br/><p>-To be exact, it was CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s project.</p><br/><p>-I heard that they poured an enormous amount of money in the US market, so this failure likely hurts a lot. What do you think they\u2019ll do from now on?</p><br/><p>-W&amp;U\u2019s PR Team commented about how this was just them taking a breather.</p><br/><p>-That\u2019s just a public comment. I heard that their contract with a major Hollywood agency, which caused a lot of buzz when it was first announced, ended. I think it\u2019s fine to say that this is actually them pulling out from the US market?</p><br/><p>-It just shows how hard it is to get your foot in the door in Hollywood. How sad.</p><br/><p>Despite their words, the panelists were talking excitedly. They criticized CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s failure and negatively predicted actors\u2019 activity here having lost some of their fame in the country now. Reporters quickly proceeded to publish Asian actors who entered Hollywood.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon was astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey went with the thoughts of starting with nothing and ended up suffering for it. Their futures will be tough. We did well by not going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Joowon\u2019s interested in Hollywood though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Sung Uimin made a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Considering the situation, the company will probably put entering the US market on hold for a few years. Also, which actor doesn\u2019t want to become a world star? Heck, I want to too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, how about Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon turned to ask me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha lived overseas so she\u2019s good at English. Is she not interested in Hollywood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Songha never mentioned the US.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I recalled the future vision I saw a long time ago.</p><br/><p>The future where Lee Songha filmed a secret audition tape. Apparently, a casting director put her on the audition list after learning about her through her role as an interpreter on Cat Guardian Ghost. They also said they didn\u2019t know what the title was, who was the director, and what role it was for.</p><br/><p>I wondered if that might have been a Hollywood project.</p><br/><p>She had yet to receive a secret audition proposal until now.</p><br/><p>The future had either yet to come or it completely disappeared through the butterfly effect of me changing the present. It was one of the two.</p><br/><p>This time, Chief Sung Uimin asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you, Team Leader Jung? Are you interested in Hollywood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hollywood, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am interested, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation between panelists entered my ears.</p><br/><p>-Will failing to enter the US market affect W&amp;U\u2019s domestic position?</p><br/><p>-What\u2019s funny about that is, while W&amp;U was wasting away in Hollywood, things have been going very well for them in the domestic and Chinese market. Their celebrities\u2019 albums or projects have done extremely well.</p><br/><p>-It was great. They\u2019ve been on a streak since early this year.</p><br/><p>-Above all, Mr. Jung Sunwoo firmly building up his image as \u2018never failing\u2019 played a huge role. Any W&amp;U fully took that image in. They\u2019ve been on a roll domestically that we didn\u2019t notice their failure in the US. Until now.</p><br/><p>-This, it seems that a lot hangs on Mr. Jung Sunwoo\u2019s next project.</p><br/><p>My photo appeared on the screen for reference.</p><br/><p>An employee ran up the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Team 1 Leader and actors arrived below!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people around me murmured. The employee gulped before adding,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mood is really terrible.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-209\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 209\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-211\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 211\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201520\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

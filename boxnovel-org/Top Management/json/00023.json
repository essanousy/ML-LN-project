In her mid-thirties. Married. Released two romance novels under a pen name and was completely new to writing dramas.</p><br/><p>So this person was the one who hit the jackpot with her debuting work?</p><br/><p>Then after this drama ends, her worth would go up tremendously. And this would be the only time she would be troubled with casting actors as a new writer.</p><br/><p>So it was definitely a chance that wouldn\u2019t come twice.</p><br/><p>If I was assigned to an actor, I would have immediately looked up the date of the audition. But, I wasn\u2019t. Even though I knew this would be a huge success, I had no actors to push.</p><br/><p>My actor\u2026 when I thought that, I recalled Sung Dowon.</p><br/><p>Should I ask him?</p><br/><p>My eyes shined for 3 seconds before I shook my head. Ridiculous. What did he lack that he would do a new writer\u2019s drama, on a cable network to boot? He was a top actor who people would cling to cast in a public network drama for $70, 000 per episode.</p><br/><p>Was there a new actor in W&amp;U that I could talk to?</p><br/><p>I recalled the frames on the fifth-floor hallway before shaking my head again.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>I was currently Neptune\u2019s manager. I couldn\u2019t go to a new actor, show him the synopsis and ask him to do it with me. Those people would all have their assigned managers as well.</p><br/><p>It would be a relief if I didn\u2019t get beat for touching someone else\u2019s rice bowl[1]. Even if it was me, I would be frigging pissed.</p><br/><p>So an actor with no assigned manager, did I have to find an aspiring actor outside of W&amp;U? However, since I was part of W&amp;U, I didn\u2019t know if it was possible to approach a different actor and even if it was possible, I didn\u2019t know what to do. Unless my foresight ability kindly gave me new information on an aspiring actor that would pass the audition. Above all, I didn\u2019t have time to push this forward.</p><br/><p>Since I was in a situation where I couldn\u2019t even go home and was sleeping in the company\u2019s sleeping quarters.</p><br/><p>Of course, the traitor who lay above me and Hyunjo who lay on the other side were passed out.</p><br/><p>Buzz.</p><br/><p>My phone lit up as it vibrated.</p><br/><p>Right, I forgot today was the day I was supposed to call my brother.</p><br/><p>-Are you free to chat?</p><br/><p>It seemed like someone had seen the light in that short moment as I heard someone move. I quickly put on my shoes and left the sleeping quarters. Blech\u2026 I was still drunk so every time I moved my head would ring.</p><br/><p>I stood in the chilly hallway and called back. After a few rings, he answered.</p><br/><p>-Yeah. Are you still working?</p><br/><p>\u201cI was lying down to sleep. I was going to call you once I finished but I forgot, sorry. Were you still up because of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was already passed 1 a.m. It was natural for me to be up at this hour but my brother was the type to sleep right at midnight.</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s fine. I got lost in reading and didn\u2019t notice the time. Are you home?</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>-You are still in Seoul, right? You haven\u2019t been sold off to a faraway district, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going back and forth from Chungdam-dong and Sangam-dong every day. Right now, I have no time. I\u2019m constantly following behind Neptune but soon, the trai-, no, the person I work with and I are going to split the jobs and then I\u2019ll have some breathing room.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Okay. Come to my house then. The kids are really looking forward to seeing you.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen them. When I would see them once every two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Come solidly prepared. It looks like they have a lot of questions for you. When you come, we might even have to set up a press conference.</p><br/><p>I held my phone as I laughed for a long time. So those kids were looking forward to seeing me? I wasn\u2019t sure if they were waiting for me or something else\u2026 even if it was a bit embarrassing, I should ask if I could obtain some signed Blackout CDs.</p><br/><p>-I think celebrity managers are at the same level as superheroes and the president.</p><br/><p>My laugh instantly died down. I even awoke from my drunken state.</p><br/><p>With the mention of superheroes, I thought of my supernatural ability.</p><br/><p>-You probably need to rest so let\u2019s hang up. Wear warm clothes. You don\u2019t have anything going on, right?</p><br/><p>Unorganized words I weren\u2019t sure of crept up to my throat before I stopped them. The words that came out of my mouth would be the same as an everyday joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLots of things. Every day is dynamic.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Haha. That fits well with you.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not the same person as I was in the past. It\u2019s been a while since my life\u2019s changed to a fantasy blockbuster.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a joke; it was the truth.</p><br/><p>-Hahaha. That seems like fun.</p><br/><p>I could hear my brother\u2019s deep laugh.</p><br/><p>As I was quietly listening, slowly a smile appeared on my lips.</p><br/><p>It had a been a few days since my foresight ability suddenly squeezed into my life. At first I was at a loss, but afterwards, since it helped me, I embraced it. And the fact that no one knew and that I could be the sole person who possessed such an ability excited me as well.</p><br/><p>However, somewhere in my heart, I felt nervous that I was caught in some unrealistic event.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like I confessed anything but just talking casually like this relaxed my heart. Although I was caught up in something unreal, I was still reassured that I had my life and my family.</p><br/><p>I ended my call with my brother and went to the office. I didn\u2019t know if it was because I awoke from my drunken state but I was thirsty.</p><br/><p>I filled a paper cup to the brim with water, drank it and returned to the sleeping quarters with quick steps. It was too cold outside with only a t-shirt. If it was already like this, I wondered what I would do during the winter. Did I have to buy hot packs in bulk?</p><br/><p>Brr, I needed to quickly slide myself into warm covers and rest my eyes for a bit.</p><br/><p>Just when I was thinking that, my phone vibrated again.</p><br/><p>-Oppa, sorry it\u2019s late. Are you still at the company?</p><br/><p>It was a message from Seoyoung.</p><br/><p>-Yeah. Why?</p><br/><p>-Songha still hasn\u2019t come home. She doesn\u2019t answer her phone. Could you check if she\u2019s in the practice room? I\u2019m so worried I can\u2019t sleep. T^T</p><br/><p>-Okay. I\u2019ll go check.</p><br/><p>-Yes yes. Thank you!</p><br/><p>I got on the elevator and went to the practice room located in the basement. It wasn\u2019t strange for Songha to stay late in the practice room. Since even I had seen her there a few times. At first, when I saw her roaming around with her hair down, my heart felt like it was about to stop.</p><br/><p>Although Neptune did practice a lot, Songha was the one that spent the most time practicing among them.</p><br/><p>As expected, the lights of the practice room were lit today as well.</p><br/><p>Knock, knock.</p><br/><p>I knocked a few times but there was no answer. When I opened the door and entered, I saw Songha coolly moving in front of the dance mirror. She was in the middle of practicing the choreography and the vocals of Neptune\u2019s title track. She practiced for so long that even her back was soaking wet.</p><br/><p>I closed the door and briefly observed Songha.</p><br/><p>Her actions and expression reflected on the mirror.</p><br/><p>I thought this when I first saw her but Songha really wasn\u2019t simply pretty.</p><br/><p>Maybe she was born with it or she was doing it deliberately but she really had a certain charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like the song had ended during the time I was blankly staring at her. Songha\u2019s eyes widened and her face stiffened as she turned towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now. Seoyoung was worried that she couldn\u2019t contact you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it was already this late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha who was surprised when she saw her phone replied to a text.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will just do another hour. You can go in first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to wake up before the sun rises for your schedule tomorrow. Are you going to be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I eat as much as I use.\u201d</p><br/><p>So there was a reason why she would eat so much every meal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working hard, practicing until morning by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Because I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey might lose because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLose\u2026 Ah. The mission for Next K-Star?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could feel the worry in her voice.</p><br/><p>So she was practicing this hard for the team mission.</p><br/><p>The reason why she felt sad was because even if she practiced for an incredible amount of time, she wasn\u2019t as good at singing as Taehee and she wasn\u2019t as good at dancing as Seoyoung. That was why her position was subvocal and subdancer. And rap, well there was nothing to say.</p><br/><p>She knew herself that she was lacking compared to the other members. And that was why she would practice alone.</p><br/><p>Since she thought she was a burden to the team.</p><br/><p>Even though her skills were lacking relative to the others, she had the most parts in the center in their dance. Even in music videos, her face would come up the most often. It definitely was a weight on her shoulders.</p><br/><p>Although Hyunjo said that she had the most exposure since she was the prettiest, my thoughts were different. I couldn\u2019t say it in case they said, \u201cWhat would you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>From my personal opinion, Songha\u2019s acting was good.</p><br/><p>A short 3-minute 40-second track definitely had a story. Neptune\u2019s title track was about a woman who struggles between a man she loves and a man who loves her. The lyrics expressed the conflicted heart very well.</p><br/><p>Although the girls were good at dancing and singing, outstanding singing abilities and dance skills weren\u2019t able to convey that emotion. It did look like those girls tried hard to convey it but they seemed to come short by 2%.</p><br/><p>However, Songha was able to convey the conflicting emotion in the lyrics as they were. With only her expression and voice. It didn\u2019t even look like she was trying hard either.</p><br/><p>So for the 3 minutes and 40 seconds, no, for the few seconds Songha would sing, I would be completely immersed in it. And of course, the lyrics would pour into my ears.</p><br/><p>I thought that was really impressive.</p><br/><p>It was a bit regrettable that she didn\u2019t think that way and only urged herself to practice areas she lacked.</p><br/><p>No matter how much I thought about it, she really should be an actor\u2026</p><br/><p>I abruptly revealed the thoughts I had while observing her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you ever think about acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>I came to the future at a completed unexpected time.</p><br/><p>I quickly grasped my surroundings. This time was once again the hazy failed connected future. I was sitting on a beige chair looking at a video on a laptop.</p><br/><p>The table seemed very familiar\u2026 Ah, this was the meeting room.</p><br/><p>The person in the video was Songha. She looked similar to her current age. Her hairstyle was different. It was the same straight black hair but it was bit longer. If you weren\u2019t sharp-sighted, you wouldn\u2019t notice it but in preparation for situations like this, I meticulously remembered the girls\u2019 appearances.</p><br/><p>How long would it take for her hair to grow that much? No, since she could have cut it when it was longer, I can\u2019t determine the date just from her hair.</p><br/><p>But what was Songha doing?</p><br/><p>I narrowed my eyes and concentrated. In the video, Songha was talking and moving by herself. Because of the static, I couldn\u2019t hear it clearly but it seemed like she was talking in both Korean and English.</p><br/><p>Was she perhaps\u2026 acting?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone asked from behind. Who was it?</p><br/><p>My future self didn\u2019t even look at the person behind me and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We just need to send it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how did they know about Songha and send her a synopsis?\u201d</p><br/><p>They sent a synopsis?</p><br/><p>Then was she really acting? Was this an audition video?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like their casting director coincidentally saw her playing an interpreter and added her on their list.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha\u2026 She really did play that one well. It was the rediscovering of Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected!</p><br/><p>I knew it. My thoughts were right.</p><br/><p>That Songha would be good at acting.</p><br/><p>I forcefully calmed down my excitement and shoved the information into my head. Role as an interpreter and a casting director coincidentally saw her acting and added her to their list.</p><br/><p>The person behind me threw his thick arm on my shoulder. And I heard his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut do we really not know what this project is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really don\u2019t. We don\u2019t know the title and the director. We don\u2019t even know her role. It is a completely closed door audition. I am curious about their identity as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Songha goes to the final audition\u2026 we\u2019ll probably know then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActing?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I regained my senses, I was once again in the practice room.</p><br/><p>In front of me, Songha was staring at me with a sour look.</p><br/><p>At that moment, without my knowledge, without any filters, these words popped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You should act.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>[1] So their paycheck.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-22\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 22\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-24\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 24\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201158\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Hearing his nonsense was funny.</p><br/><p>Stretching his bowed back, Director Park laughed like I did. Then he tapped my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did well in ripping this up. I was thinking about increasing his pay and signing a new contract anyways. Producer Park, what are you doing? I told you to print the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said with a smile.</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk, who stood up to jump into the conversation, lost his chance and closed his mouth. Then, faltering, Producer Park Sookyung\u2019s gaze alternated between me and Director Park.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you print a contract without reason? You\u2019re just wasting ink.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung Sunwoo. Are you acting like this to gain something? If a director bowed this much, you should at least give him some face. Do you not think of the future? Are you going to keep this unpleasant mood when we\u2019re filming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you are misunderstanding something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe I properly conveyed my thoughts. We have no plans on continuing with this movie. We aren\u2019t trying to gain anything from you either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s aura became fierce. He acted like he would give us his kidney just moments ago, but now he looked like he wanted to rip my kidney out and chew on it raw. He approached me with this threatening aura. Nam Joyoon silently took a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cDi-director, Ace keeps calling us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the fifth time. They are texting me to answer the phone, what should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you not to answer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park shouted before glaring at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, you\u2019re unexpectedly the type to hold long grudges.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your grudges last this long, then your life will become tiresome. As a chief, you should be concentrating on managing your contacts, yet what do you hope to gain from acting like this to a director like me? I told you rumors spread quickly in this industry. You should look to the future. Are you not planning on working in this industry for a long time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why were there so many people worrying about my future these days?</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore, you bastard! Are you threatening someone in front of me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk cut in, huffing and puffing. His already large body coupled with the scowl on his face gave off a murderous feeling. However, Director Park didn\u2019t even look at CEO Kim Pansuk as he mocked,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not threatening him, just warning, no, giving him advice. As he works in this industry, he\u2019ll be faced with worse situations than this, but what is he going to do if he breaks off relationships every time he\u2019s faced with situations like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned my gaze from the two arguing men and looked to my side.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s face became murkier since Director Park mentioned spreading rumors about me. Table throwing once was enough. Even if there weren\u2019t any cameras, there were too many watching eyes here.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike you said, it\u2019ll be best if not to make enemies if I\u2019m not confident in handling it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard me, Director Park turned to me with a bright face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! There\u2019s no need to hate ea-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I plan on handling it this time no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I would act like this without even that much determination?\u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered for a long time.</p><br/><p>Should I endure it or not? Should I go all the way or not?</p><br/><p>Was this situation one I could handle or not?</p><br/><p>Only after wondering and pondering on it did I finally act.</p><br/><p>And\u2026 Well, I didn\u2019t think I would regret this decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being reckless! You craz-!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed he now understood that he was wasting his time trying to change my mind, Director Park\u2019s face turned red. His oppressing aura crumbled, and anxiety took its place.</p><br/><p>Just then, the nervous assistant director cut in,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector! I think you really have to pick up the phone this time. It seems like something happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, do you not understand me? I told you not to pic-!\u201d</p><br/><p>A phone abruptly began to ring.</p><br/><p>This time, it was mine. Just as I was taking out my phone, another phone began to ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the CEO\u2019s phone\u2026 Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Pan Production employees mumbled with dazed faces. The phones of other employees began to vibrate and ring. The regular phone on the desk even began to ring. It was almost like a choir.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know from experience, but this is one of two things.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said to Director Park, whose eyes were shifting rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either incredibly good news or incredibly bad news.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at my phone screen. It stopped ringing. Instead, a message icon lit up on the screen.</p><br/><p>I checked the message and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems to be good news for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park hastily took out his phone.</p><br/><p>Soon, his face distorted with confusion.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>{\u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019s new movie was noise marketing to promote a movie?}</p><br/><p>{SBE Films\u2019 confusion, Jung Sunwoo and Lee Songha\u2019s next project is Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s new movie}</p><br/><p>{Just what is going on? Two movies claiming to be \u2018Jung Sunwoo\u2019s next project\u2019, which one is right?}</p><br/><p>{Ten-million Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s new project! Incredible cast! 30 billion won blockbuster\u2026}</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer was satisfied with the articles popping up one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Minjeong, keep sending out press releases! Gogo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending it to all the entertainment reporters I know! They usually take a few days to read press releases like this, but they are checking it instantly. It\u2019s heating up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The PR coordinator replied as she rapidly typed on her keyboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about real-time search rankings? It probably made it up there, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this momentum, it should be up there soon? The situation is hilarious, and it\u2019s not even a comedy! Haa, how is the marketing team at Ace going to handle this? They probably feel like they\u2019ve been struck by lightning.\u201d</p><br/><p>She giggled before suddenly asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we really want to drive a wedge into this, we need Chief Jung Sunwoo to do an interview. Not one where you just add a comment to a press release but an interview with reporters! He\u2019ll do it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait a bit! Chief Jung told me he\u2019ll contact me as soon as he handles some urgent matters!\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer said while tossing his phone up in the air.</p><br/><p>The PR coordinator subtly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 Apparently, Chief Jung ended things with the other movie on bad terms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the details. It seems that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis situation is one where someone first spread the rumor, articles published, then Ace rushed over in excitement at their luck. Thinking about it now, it\u2019s like their people dug their own graves? So I\u2019m just hypothesizing but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it that your intro is so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose graves, what if Chief Jung set them up? Were there any rumors about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo? I mean you must have looked into the source of the rumor yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If things got this big, usually you\u2019d expect rumors about the source amongst reporters, but it\u2019s completely quiet. I asked the reporter Chief Jung Sunwoo is apparently close to, but it\u2019s not her either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The PR coordinator licked her lips like she was going to die from curiosity.</p><br/><p>The project producer scratched below his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, but if Chief Jung Sunwoo had a hand in this, let me know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you look at it, there are a lot of people who have the ability to do something like that, but people who actually go through with it are rare. Also, if someone like that becomes successful, nine times out of ten\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck? Why is it so loud out here? Did a war break out?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mumbling project producer turned around. Director Choi Sungwon was walking out of the waiting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, director. Are you done thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMostly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer came up close and poked the director\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile I was outside, what did Chief Jung Sunwoo, that unknown actor, and you do? What did you do that you were thinking so hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon didn\u2019t reply and simply rubbed his beard.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Reporter Kim. Don\u2019t publish the article now. I\u2019ll call you back later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is a bit complicated. I\u2019ll call you back once it\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Pan Production employees were having a hard time as they clung to their phones. CEO Kim Pansuk and the assistant director were also in similar situations. The only ones who weren\u2019t on the phone were Nam Joyoon, Director Park, and me.</p><br/><p>Director Park tapped his phone furiously with his stubby fingers.</p><br/><p>His face turned red, then blue, and was now black.</p><br/><p>I could tell what he was seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you..!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mumbling, Director Park suddenly turned his gaze.</p><br/><p>His hand then clamped on Nam Joyoon\u2019s shoulder. Nam Joyoon frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Nam Joyoon! Are you going to throw it all away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he change his target because he couldn\u2019t get through to me?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you just going to sit still? You need to persuade Mr. Jung Sunwoo! Having spent 10 years as an unknown actor on the bottom rung, you should know better than anyone else how big of an opportunity this is! Are you just going to kick away this golden opportunity? Isn\u2019t it a shame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat the scenario met a bad maker.\u201d</p><br/><p>At his calm words, Director Park\u2019s expression crumbled into nothingness.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the contract is settled, let\u2019s go. No need to listen to these harsh words any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, he secretly pushed my back as if urging me to leave.</p><br/><p>However, we were stopped before we could take two steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, where the hell do you think you\u2019re going?! Though I don\u2019t know what kind of things Chief Jung Sunwoo told you, you are an unknown rookie in the world of commercial films!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park shouted frustratedly.</p><br/><p>The whites in his eyes reddened in agitation as his eyes rolled nonstop.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, you shouldn\u2019t act like this if you really care about Mr. Joyoon! What are you banking on? For W&amp;U to help you? Give up on trying to use Lee Songha as leverage! Mark my words, W&amp;U will never help Mr. Joyoon regarding this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I have no plans on asking W&amp;U for help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you know that I, my movie, is the best you can get for Mr. Joyoon! Is he going to go back to independent films and help move luggage around? Or is there someone who can offer the same conditions as me? Is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the- What?\u201d</p><br/><p>His ear-piercing shouts halted as his lips simply flapped.</p><br/><p>The Pan Production employees who were busy on the phone and even the nervous assistant director stared at me with faces asking me what I meant. I looked down at my vibrating phone again. It was SBE\u2019s film project producer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s new 34-billion-won budget project, the conditions are incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a strange expression on his face, Director Park stuttered,</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s Lee Songha\u2019s film-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Choi Sungwon gave us this opportunity. To obtain an opportunity to appear on Director Choi\u2019s project is a dream for most actors. I think words like \u2018golden opportunity\u2019 are more suited for things like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s face became even stranger.</p><br/><p>Just then, the assistant director paled as he grabbed Director Park\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector! Ace said that if you don\u2019t answer the phone, they might actually take their hands off our proj-!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>For a moment, Director Park\u2019s eyes moved furiously as he thought through the situation.</p><br/><p>The situation was accelerating to the worst possible. However, it wasn\u2019t like there was impossible to turn it around since Jung Sunwoo himself hadn\u2019t yet done an interview.</p><br/><p>If he could get Nam Joyoon to sign his contract again, the events of today would simply be something in the passing.</p><br/><p>The media, which was in an uproar, and even Ace would quiet down.</p><br/><p>As long as he persuaded them somehow.</p><br/><p>Somehow.</p><br/><p>If persuasion, reason, and threats didn\u2019t work, there was only one option left. Though he wanted to avoid it, it was his only option. Director Park bit the inside of his lip. His face crumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould the assistant director and I kneel and beg? Huh? Would that be enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Director Park licked his dry lips and said in a slightly heartbreaking voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you two leave, I don\u2019t know what will happen to the film. There are so many people tied to this project. If there\u2019s an investment problem because of you two, then what are we to do about all of them? What about the extras who live paycheck to paycheck? Mr. Joyoon, you should be aware of the situation on set, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park looked like he was about to kneel as he clung to us.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want, the assistant director and I will really kneel so please think of the others and continue working on the film. No, could you please continue working with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>He begged as he looked in front of him.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t fazed by threats or shouts, Nam Joyoon\u2019s eyes now trembled. Director Park inwardly became relieved. Like he expected, Nam Joyoon\u2019s heart was wavering.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was different in movies, but someone kneeling in real life was rare. Since he added the film staff into the mix, it would be stranger if his heart didn\u2019t waver.</p><br/><p>While it hurt his pride, it was worth it.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Director Park looked to his side and was shaken.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo was staring directly at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, director, now that I think about it, I have something I want to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs\u2026 Ask me anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what you said just now. How W&amp;U will never help Mr. Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked in a strangely soft voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know for you to guarantee that?\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-132\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 132\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-134\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 134\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201378\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

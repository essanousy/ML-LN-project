The sky was gloomy without a single ray of sunshine since morning, and now, dark clouds had gathered to cover the sky in a dark gray color.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it will rain today?\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if it was any other day, but we had an outdoor schedule today so it mattered very much.</p><br/><p>The traitor, who was in the driver\u2019s seat, shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, there wasn\u2019t anything in the morning about it raining today. Check again.\u201d</p><br/><p>I checked the daily forecast app again. It still only showed a cloud icon. The chance of precipitation was low as well, and it indicated that the clouds would disperse and that it would be sunny in an hour.</p><br/><p>Was I too worried?</p><br/><p>When I was about to put away my cellphone, it vibrated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I am the youngest writer from the Hope Campaign. When do you think you will arrive?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are entering the parking lot right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The writer said she would come find us before hanging up.</p><br/><p>The schedule we were going to was a live broadcast for a sharing campaign, and they had asked Neptune to perform a song. We troubled over the decision because it overlapped with Next K-Star, but we eventually agreed because there weren\u2019t many chances to broadcast their performance on a public TV network.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirls, we\u2019re he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I shut my mouth when I saw the situation behind me. They had nodded their heads sleepily when we were on the highway, but now they were all sleeping like logs, wrapped in blankets with their heads resting on each other\u2019s heads and shoulders.</p><br/><p>Since their makeup artists and stylists were also dozing off, the traitor and I got out first. As soon as I went out, the cold air seemed to scratch my neck as it passed by.</p><br/><p>Brr, it\u2019s cold.</p><br/><p>Soon after, a woman ran towards us. Looking at how she had an official badge and a headset-style wireless intercom, it seemed she was the youngest writer who had called just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello! Are you Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a stage rehearsal in 30 minutes. Neptune will be on second.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor cut in and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a Next K-Star recording in the afternoon so we need to go immediately. There won\u2019t be any delays or anything like that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, it\u2019s a live broadcast. It will be over after an hour broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will lead you to the waiting room. The members are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was too cold outside. If even I, who was dressed warmly, was cold, the girls, who were wearing their stage outfits that exposed their arms and legs, would shiver intensely if they came out.</p><br/><p>As if he thought the same thing, the traitor showed a friendly smile and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe girls are sleeping right now. Would it be okay if we let them wait inside the van?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, of course! You can do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest writer readily nodded her head. Something suddenly crossed my mind so I asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Writer, the weather looks uneasy; will it be fine? It\u2019s an outdoor performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe weather was supposed to be good today, but it\u2019s like this. We contacted the weather center and they said there will be no problems. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yeah, let\u2019s trust the weather center.</p><br/><p>After we decided to wake the girls in 10 minutes and were about to send Kim Hyunjo a text that we arrived,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor asked abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it on your first day. That you weren\u2019t interested in being an idol manager and that you honestly wanted to be a manager for an actor. That you would immediately transfer if there was a chance to switch to the actor team.\u201d</p><br/><p>I did say that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you go? When he wasn\u2019t an unknown actor but Sung Dowon?\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor asked again.</p><br/><p>I took a moment to choose my words. Perhaps it was because I had set up a wall, but my thought would become complicated whenever we talked.</p><br/><p>What was he thinking now, what motives does he have by asking this, maybe he\u2019s trying to do something, maybe, maybe. Thoughts like these continuously entered my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI kept thinking of Neptune when I thought about switching. Like you said then, now that I\u2019ve experienced it, it\u2019s not bad being assigned to the idol team. And I also had some personal circumstances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCircumstances? What, that you didn\u2019t get a good vibe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked to my side. The traitor was looking at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><br/><p>With an undecipherable expression, he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something I want to ask you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then.</p><br/><p>He stopped what he was about to say and looked up at the sky. I hurriedly looked up as well. The sky was much darker than before. It was completely covered with dark clouds. As if it would rain any second.</p><br/><p>Then -drip- cold water dripped onto my forehead.</p><br/><p>Damn, it\u2019s raining!</p><br/><p>I ran around in the cold rain, looking for the youngest writer. She wouldn\u2019t answer her phone so I wandered for a long time before finding her behind the stage. When I looked closer, she was talking to a man in a raincoat.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, should we continue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what the department manager said? Since we don\u2019t have enough time before the broadcast to change the cue sheets, he says to go as planned!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do if it continues to rain once we\u2019re live? What about the singers\u2019 performances?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe studio control booth contacted the weather center, and they say it will pass soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>That damn weather center, didn\u2019t they say there weren\u2019t going to be any problems a little while ago?</p><br/><p>I called after the youngest writer who was about to run off somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Writer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Manager. I was just about to call you, but the rehearsal might be slightly delayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the rain doesn\u2019t stop, what other alternatives\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest writer showed an awkward expression at my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was a recorded broadcast, we can just wait a little before continuing, but since this is a live broadcast, I think it might continue as it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you put tarps up on the stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, please wait, I\u2019ll ask. Producer!\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest writer ran to the male producer she was talking to previously and asked. Soon after, the producer let out a sigh and walked towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the chief\u2026 who\u2019s in charge of Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m their manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 If we cover the stage, it looks messy on the jib camera<sup>{1}</sup>. The department manager cares a lot about the picture, so that\u2019s a problem we\u2019ll have to think about in the worst case scenario. Since it\u2019s not that bad now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not that bad now?</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the studio will tell the MCs to comment about how Neptune showed a passionate performance even though it\u2019s raining. If we broadcast something like this, it could become a hot topic so please bear with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer didn\u2019t even bother to wait for my reply as he hurriedly ran off.</p><br/><p>I let out a sigh instead of what was boiling up inside. The youngest writer read my mood and cautiously said,</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, we\u2019ll get you some umbrellas and raincoats, and I\u2019ll try to find some towels as well. And let\u2019s refrain from dancing too hard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Eventually, all I was left with were 4 transparent umbrellas and a few raincoats in my hand. When I returned to the parking lot and got into the van with these in hand, the traitor and the girls, who were chatting noisily, turned to look at me at the same time.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa! Why would you get wet when you\u2019re holding 4 umbrellas!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was already wet so it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we don\u2019t have any towels\u2026 Use this to wipe off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung handed me the blanket she had covered herself with.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I dried my hair that was dripping with water, I asked the traitor,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say they are going to continue even if it rains. Did you contact the chief?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said we can\u2019t do anything since it\u2019s a live broadcast. He said that they cannot get hurt and to minimize their dancing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their words were similar. Worried, I looked towards the girls, but they had calm expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we need to do it since we\u2019re going on air. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a typhoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just need to be careful not to fall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, there are a lot of times when we perform in the rain.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all nodded their heads as if there was no problem. I concealed my uneasiness and looked out the window. Thick raindrops knocked heavily on the window.</p><br/><p>Only after the scheduled time had long since passed did they begin the rehearsal.</p><br/><p>While the solo artist was rehearsing first, we waited, gathered under a tarp next to the stage. The solo artist had an umbrella and was wearing a raincoat as he rehearsed leisurely. His manager who was watching him looked calm as well.</p><br/><p>Well, since he didn\u2019t have any big actions and could simply sing while standing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say he\u2019s going to perform with an umbrella, how about we have umbrellas as well\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, in case umbrellas could be okay even if raincoats weren\u2019t, but Lee Taehee firmly shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more dangerous if we hold an umbrella in one hand and a mic in the other. The umbrella takes up a lot of space so our movements will become tangled, and the moment we slip up, it\u2019ll become a mess. No matter what kind of circumstances we\u2019re in, there are people watching us on TV, and this isn\u2019t professional.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, we\u2019ll be careful so don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like the rain is starting stop anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the other girls were like this as well, there was nothing I could say.</p><br/><p>Soon after, the solo artist finished his performance, and the youngest writer gave the signal.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune, please go up now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls walked out into the rain.</p><br/><p>Once they got into position on the stage, the MR of their title track flowed out. I gulped down my dry saliva as I observed the stage. Although the rain had died down compared to before, the girls were completely soaked by the time they sang half their song. They danced in risky high heels, energetically moving on the wet stage.</p><br/><p>However, since the people who were wandering around the plaza were hiding from the rain in various places, almost no one was paying attention to them. Only the cameras in front of the stage were working hard to film them.</p><br/><p>The song was almost over. When I relaxed, thinking the rehearsal would end with no problems.</p><br/><p>The rain started to fall crazily.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this dangerous?</p><br/><p>At this point, it wasn\u2019t a problem of getting wet, but their vision would get hazy. If the rain dripped into their eyes, it would become difficult to see. Just when I was wondering\u2026 how they could dance in these conditions.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who was spinning on top of the stage, suddenly staggered and fell.</p><br/><p>My heart plummeted. I was about to run up, but Lee Songha stood right back up like a roly-poly toy<sup>{2}</sup>. Then she continued to dance.</p><br/><p>Was she okay? Was she okay?</p><br/><p>My heart was agitated, but fortunately, the song ended without any additional accidents. I covered the girls coming down from the stage with blankets and led them to the tarp. When we returned, they all surrounded Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, are you okay? Did you get hurt?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it looked like you fell pretty hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha moved both her legs vigorously and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s fine. I can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like she would protest if we didn\u2019t let her on stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might be too agitated to feel it right now. Sit down, let\u2019s have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat her down on a chair and checked her ankle. Although I wasn\u2019t an expert, it luckily looked fine on the outside. She didn\u2019t look to be in pain when I grabbed it a bit hard, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any wounds on her leg either.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt does seem to be fine\u2026 That was close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI lost my balance when the rain got in my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me right away if you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha nodded with a blanket wrapped around her.</p><br/><p>The rehearsal started later than expected so there wasn\u2019t much time before the main stage. While they were examining their makeup and hair in the van due to the rain, the traitor, who had gone out to see the situation outside, returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rain has almost stopped, it\u2019s to the point where only a few drops are falling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 That\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><br/><p>So the weather center wasn\u2019t completely wrong. It really did pass.</p><br/><p>When I looked outside, it was clearly raining sparsely. The ballad singer was on stage, performing without an umbrella. Since they said that they would transfer to the studio after his performance before it was our turn, there really wasn\u2019t much time left.</p><br/><p>Just when I was about to return to the tarp with the girls and wait.</p><br/><p>The youngest writer peeped in.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Ms. Writer. It\u2019s fortunate that the rain stopped.\u201d</p><br/><p>She showed an awkward expression at my words before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, Mr. Manager. We got a call from the studio control booth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t think Neptune can perform.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems they hastily came to this decision after seeing one of Neptune\u2019s members fall. They said that it could be a big problem if any mishaps occur due to safety\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. We will pay you more than the pay we discussed previously.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood blankly, processing her words. Then I suddenly looked back. At the people looking in this direction. And amongst them, I saw Lee Songha first, standing rigidly with widened eyes.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jib_(camera)</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roly-poly_toy</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-36\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 36\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-38\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 38\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201186\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

You said that Neptune has to film Making Film after, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are filming it right now to be exact. We plan on having an interview after the event.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while nodding.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Yoon licked his lips. His eyes shifted quickly within his plump frame.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould we perhaps extend Neptune\u2019s performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExtend it?\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought about it.</p><br/><p>How could I make the best use of this sudden situation? My mind wandered to the people I left behind in the waiting room, the cameraman filming this current situation, and the screaming fans outside.</p><br/><p>Just as I began to draw an outline of my plan, Team Leader Yoon couldn\u2019t wait and said in a desperate manner,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be forever grateful if you could help me this once. You probably overhead, but, sigh, it looks like Babel will be a little late. It just happened that they were our finale\u2026! The crowd is full of people who came to see them. On top of that, their fans are famously hardcore.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare for a boy group fandom to not be hardcore.</p><br/><p>As girls who came early in the morning to see \u2018their oppas\u2019, they would grow more dissatisfied the longer Babel delayed. While they might not throw stones, they might throw trash.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Babel\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Yoon stopped and glanced at the cameraman. The cameraman turned his camera off and took a step back. As he gestured as if to tell Team Leader Yoon not to worry, Team Leader Yoon continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile they might complain less if they hear Babel got in an accident, it seems Babel\u2019s company wants to ensure the reporters don\u2019t hear about this until the situation is settled and they send out a press release.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing as they said they would still make an appearance, it didn\u2019t seem like they were at fault, and the members seemed to be fine. However, if they let thousands of fans know about the accident, it would immediately spread online.</p><br/><p>Then reporters would swarm in and write even more provocative articles.</p><br/><p>It was difficult for the event agency to ignore a request from a group like Babel in order to maintain a good relationship for future events.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, please help us, Chief Jung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Yoon begged.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Neptune\u2019s on stage, then the crowd shouldn\u2019t be too dissatisfied by the delay..!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much time do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked while glancing at my watch. Team Leader Yoon held my hand like it was a lifeline. I asked again to the man profusely expressing his gratitude,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to keep the delay to a minimum. They don\u2019t have a wide repertoire so it\u2019s impossible to extend their performance for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-how long can you extend it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Normally, we would have four songs \u2013 Satellite and Pisces from their mini-album, their other hit track from their other album, and Lee Taehee\u2019s solo OST. With greetings and some light talk, we could hold on for 30 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we want to add more, it would have to be their missing track from Next K-Star, but I\u2019ll have to check with the girls since these songs weren\u2019t planned for today. We can\u2019t let them make a flawed performance since tons of fancams will be posted after the event.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. Pl-please take care of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled and turned around.</p><br/><p>The cameraman had started filming at some point.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe team leader asked me to give this to you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the event agency\u2019s employees handed me a box. It was full of sandwiches, salads, chips, and drinks. Lee Songha jumped to her feet and accepted the box. Having seen Lee Songha up close, the employee left the room with a red face.</p><br/><p>Our meeting continued.</p><br/><p>The always reliable Lee Taehee calmly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two mission songs we frequently performed at events. We can do those since we\u2019ve been practicing them for events. What do you think, Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha nodded</p><br/><p>\u201cI practiced them yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we can do an encore on top of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung counted on her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we talk with the audience a bit longer. Oppa, what if we talk with the host longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any comments prepared. You\u2019re in the public\u2019s eye. It\u2019ll be big trouble if you say something bad because you\u2019re excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Also, the host, who was a comedian, was the frivolous type. The type who made provocative comments to drag out the audience\u2019s reaction and cause controversy. How could I send them out there with no idea about what he might ask? No matter how much we plead the host to be moderate, there was no guarantee on what would happen on stage.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung smacked her lips in regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if we just introduce our songs and do an extra performance, I think we can extend it by 15 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we add it with our original performance, it\u2019ll be almost 30 minutes long. That\u2019s like a concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ said after licking her lips. Having calculated the length of their performance, Im Seoyoung flinched.</p><br/><p>\u201cC-concert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThough, Babel fans will probably be glaring at us at the front.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung, who was jumping up and down at the thought of a concert, stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-it\u2019ll be fine though, right? There are people who came to see us! Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Uh, we\u2019ll join them too! We even bought glowstick bracelets!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh Yeondu, who particularly followed Im Seoyoung after confessing she was her role model, took out a bracelet. Each of the other goldfish took one out as well and shook them like tambourines. They mentioned how Oh Yeondu paid for them out of her own pocket.</p><br/><p>I calmly looked at Pretty Girls.</p><br/><p>At the three goldfish waving their hands and Jung Jae, who was clapping.</p><br/><p>\u201cchief Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Yoon entered after knocking hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, I asked about other teams\u2019 situations and barely managed to get one team to do an encore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe probably can\u2019t fill the gap with just that though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to do a giveaway event with the host. It seems we\u2019ll be able to hold on for another twenty minutes with the encore performance. Then we have forty minutes remaining\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Yoon trailed off, knowing this was far-fetched.</p><br/><p>Then Neptune\u2019s performance would be an hour long in total. As LJ said, this was a concert. Maybe it would be different if they were experienced artists with lots of hit songs, but Neptune didn\u2019t have the repertoire or experience to pull off an hour long on-the-spot concert.</p><br/><p>I went over to Team Leader Yoon and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there nothing you can do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing else we can do. At most, we can hold on for twenty minutes. I think you have to look elsewhere for the remaining twenty minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while staring at Team Leader Yoon. He also looked at me.</p><br/><p>Then, as though he had a sudden thought, his shoulders jumped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if you came on stage\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will I do up there? Should I sing a lullaby?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiting room was filled with suppressed laughs and coughs.</p><br/><p>There were only two people who didn\u2019t laugh, Lee Songha and Team Leader Yoon. Rather, Lee Songha seemed more into the idea than Team Leader Yoon. It felt like she would give me the mic as soon as I agreed. I waved at her, indicating to not have any thoughts, and looked back at Team Leader Yoon.</p><br/><p>He looked elsewhere with anxious eyes. At Pretty Girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, it\u2019ll be more difficult for Pretty Girls, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The goldfish and Chief Lee Taeshin were shocked.</p><br/><p>Even the Making Film staff, who were laughing about me singing a lullaby, quickly focused on filming.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty Girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we\u2019ll definitely make it worth your while if they do perform. If we introduce them at a leisurely pace, even if they only do one song\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Yoon mumbled before sighing as though he had already been refused.</p><br/><p>That was because Pretty Girls currently didn\u2019t have their stage outfits, makeup, or music.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say that their preparations were non-existent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I glanced at the girls before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess we need to talk with them this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The aquarium froze.</p><br/><p>The goldfish stiffed like frozen fish and simply looked at me.</p><br/><p>Multiple cameras focused on them. Producer Yoo Sooyoung had a short discussion with me before immediately gathering the production staff and writers. Then she started an on-the-spot meeting with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>After Neptune went to a different waiting room to practice, I spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile it would be good if you did it, you don\u2019t have to if you think you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls\u2019 eyes shook like there was an earthquake.</p><br/><p>Yoon Sol cautiously raised her hand and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good if we do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sudden situation, and normally, I would refuse since there are a lot of variables. However, we are filming right now,\u201d</p><br/><p>I gestured to the cameras.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a waste to throw away such a dramatic situation like this when it came so naturally. You were already preparing for your showcase performance anyways. If you can perform well, there\u2019s no showcase that\u2019ll be better than this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls\u2019 faces turned more serious.</p><br/><p>They talked amongst each other for a while before Jung Jae said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it. Please let us perform.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other goldfish gathered around and blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe practiced every day like it was our showcase performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m confident that I won\u2019t make a mistake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe audience might not react favorably. More than Neptune\u2019s performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood chilled at my words. The goldfish simply blinked.</p><br/><p>I observed their reactions while continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough your popularity has been rising at a sharp rate these past few weeks, the people outside aren\u2019t here to see you. You\u2019ll be part of an unexpected event, and there will be many people who won\u2019t welcome you. Babel fans will be particularly unhappy.\u201d</p><br/><p>They gulped and mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cWo-would they boo and jeer, saying stuff like they\u2019ve never heard of us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr maybe throw water bottles\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t all be like that. Nor will they all leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Jae said in a quiet yet firm voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were times when the spectators all left when it was our turn to perform. Saying that there\u2019ll be nothing to see. We also performed a lot in front of people passing us on the street. \u201c</p><br/><p>Oh Yeondu fiddled with her glow-stick bracelet before holding it tight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were people that asked us to wear more racy outfits to gain people\u2019s attention. That we needed to at least show them that much since we were unknown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Jae unni alone wore short skirts. Ones that revealed her thighs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t that short. It only looked that way because my legs are long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Jae joked awkwardly before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow is different from then. There will be people outside who will be happy about our surprise performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. There will. At least a few.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere could even be a few dozens of people since there are thousands outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>The goldfish chatted amongst each other as they became livelier.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin, who was thinking about joining their conversation when the mood was down, was relieved. Then he exchanged a happy glance with Jung Jae. Soon, Jung Jae turned to look at me.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because of the past incident, but she always looked hesitant.</p><br/><p>But she was resolute right now.</p><br/><p>Enough that I could trust her.</p><br/><p>I got up and said to Chief Lee Taeshin,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lee, I already reported the situation to our superiors, so please call the stylist team for their outfits. As well as the instrumentals. Whether you get them to deliver or you go get them yourself, go with the quickest method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left Pretty Girls under the makeup artists\u2019 care and left the waiting room.</p><br/><p>Then I told Lee Kwanwoo, who followed me out after seeing my gesture,</p><br/><p>\u201cFind out Babel\u2019s chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBabel\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the crowd of people outside and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir fans are gathered here. We have to hope that some of them will listen to reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as he made an odd expression, Lee Kwanwoo quickly took out his phone.</p><br/><p>When I returned after confirming Pretty Girls\u2019 performance with Team Leader Yoon and receiving his thanks and promise of some compensation, Lee Kwanwoo already had the number of Babel\u2019s chief in his hand.</p><br/><p>I found an empty waiting room and called.</p><br/><p>-Hello?</p><br/><p>The voice was very hoarse. He sounded nervous and irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Babel\u2019s chief, correct? My name is Jung Sunwoo, the one in charge of Neptune.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Pardon?</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you got in an accident on your way here. Are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, we-we\u2019re fine. But why did you\u2026</p><br/><p>His flustered voice questioned.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Lee Kwanwoo, who was watching me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout today\u2019s university event. We decided to fill the empty time slot under the agency\u2019s request. It will be Neptune and Pretty Girls\u2019 special performance. But because we are currently filming Making Film, there will be cameras filming them.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Pr-Pretty Girls? Pardon? Cameras?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like there are a lot of hardcore Babel fans in the crowd. I think things may get ugly if they learn that Babel\u2019s performance will be delayed. I\u2019m also worried that something bad might happen when Pretty Girls go up on stage. The broadcast is one thing, but there are a lot of people here filming fancams.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, damn it. This is driving me crazy.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t go crazy.</p><br/><p>-Please wait!</p><br/><p>His voice became quiet before he came back.</p><br/><p>-Our fan manager will figure out who went to the event and explain the situation. We can\u2019t control the young ones either, so I don\u2019t know if telling them that they could be banned from the next event will be effective\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I exchanged a few more words with the groaning chief before hanging up.</p><br/><p>In front of me, Lee Kwanwoo looked at me with fervor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just thought that you always act with insurance.\u201d</p><br/><p>He replied, shrugging lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just insurance. It\u2019s not a perfect countermeasure. Do you think hardcore fans are hardcore for nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, after all this, what if they really throw water bottles\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we need to spin that in a positive way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Lee Kwanwoo\u2019s eyes widened, the ground suddenly collapsed.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Married into a Chinese conglomerate. That the person was being treated for anxiety. That the person was pregnant. That the person retired in Korea and went on to do theater in the States. There were all sorts of rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>What the heck?</p><br/><p>I was in the office again. The office of my future self.</p><br/><p>Like always in this future, Director Park and Reporter Song were in front of me.</p><br/><p>However, there was something else same about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe started when she was a child, so she was great at acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park looked in my direction and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what Son Chaeyoung\u2019s doing now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was I seeing this again?</p><br/><p>This had never happened before.</p><br/><p>Why?</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-170\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 170\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-172\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 172\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201455\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

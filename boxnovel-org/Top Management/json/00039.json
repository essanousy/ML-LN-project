I gave each of them words or encouragement to boost their morale.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee who was always dependable at times like this, Im Seoyoung who looked a bit nervous, luckily, her condition was good, and LJ who was so focused that I felt bad saying something.</p><br/><p>Lastly, to Lee Songha, who was silently burning up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, just do like you did in practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I will do my best and return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha nodded her head and followed behind the other girls who going to the front.</p><br/><p>Just then, the first mission recording of Next K-Star had begun.</p><br/><p>I realized something considerably while watching the recording scene.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the recording process, in which they stopped and resumed with multiple times, was very tiring or that cameramen who went around putting cameras in people\u2019s faces and filming managers and staff members\u2019 reactions were very bothersome either.</p><br/><p>The biggest thing I realized was that you couldn\u2019t thoughtlessly tell people to sing without instrumentals.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were teams or members who did well enough that the spectators shouted in admiration. The ones who the judges clapped for and praised that they could become the next generation K-Star.</p><br/><p>However, the performances of some teams literally made you shout. Even though they were new, it came to a point where you would worry whether it was okay to show a performance like that on a show with the words \u2018Next K-Star\u2019 in its title.</p><br/><p>The ones who were unrivaled amongst them was precisely the team currently on the stage.</p><br/><p>Sugar Cats.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026. Hmmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eventually, a sound I couldn\u2019t keep contained escaped. It wasn\u2019t only me, the people next to me were unable to look at the stage directly and avoided their gazes. There wasn\u2019t even a need to look far, Kim Hyunjo even covered his face with the hand that had been supporting his chin.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help it. Even if they had insufficient time to practice, this was too severe.</p><br/><p>After the shocking 3 minutes and 30 seconds had passed, the Sugar Cats members stood in front of the judges\u2019 table. Although their hearts were probably thumping right now, I was calming my heart as well as we waited for the judges\u2019 evaluation.</p><br/><p>This moment right now was filled with more anticipation than the first episode of a drama and more excitement than its last episode.</p><br/><p>The malicious character who stood out even amongst the three judges, Cha Suzy who had smashed the mentalities of those who performed ahead with her harsh criticisms was first to grab her mic. I didn\u2019t think too well of her since she was the type to give overly strong remarks\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have called your team Bitter Cats instead of Sugar Cats. Bitter, bitter. It\u2019s my first time scowling while listening to a song.\u201d</p><br/><p>I think I might become her fan.</p><br/><p>The Sugar Cats girls were taken aback as they stammered and tried to pass each other the mic. However, there were still two more judges left. Before the Sugar Cats could say a word, the criticisms poured in.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re singing without instrumentals, your skills are clearly revealed. This means that you were more or less covering your insufficiencies with the instrumentals up until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour key was wavering from the beginning to the end, and you lost the beat so many times I gave up counting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to compliment about. And you were a team that had good preliminary responses from our viewers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they went on a lot of variety shows.\u201d</p><br/><p>My blood seemed to flow with bubbling soda.<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>Ah. It felt like my heart had finally found peace at last.</p><br/><p>The Sugar Cats got off the stage while crying. When two cameramen filmed their crying figures on their way back to the seats, they wailed, saying that they made so many mistakes because they were nervous as this was their first mission.</p><br/><p>After their interview, the Sugar Cats returned to their seats behind us.</p><br/><p>The Sugar Cats chief clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe judges said those words to make the first episode stimulating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, that was too much. Honestly, if we had more time to practice\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said we were Bitter Cats, oppa. Were we that bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. You know Cha Suzy\u2019s style. Because people tell her she\u2019s a tough unni and a girl crush, she said those harsh comments to harden her character. You didn\u2019t do so bad to hear those words. Look at the other teams, the evaluations will be similar.\u201d</p><br/><p>At his final words, Kim Hyunjo flipped his head around. The Sugar Cats chief cleared his throat and avoided his gaze.</p><br/><p>It was because Neptune was up next.</p><br/><p>The girls, who were waiting with other teams in the front row, cheered and got up. Then they calmly walked in front of the judges\u2019 table.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune\u2026 They have the lowest popularity amongst the participating teams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir skills were pretty good when I saw their music video.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we judged that, then no team would have been criticized.\u201d</p><br/><p>The judges, who had seen Neptune\u2019s preliminary video ahead of time, exchanged some light chatter. Lee Taehee and Im Seoyoung smoothly answered their questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then, let\u2019s see your performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>I clenched the armrests and watched the stage.</p><br/><p>Breaking the silence, their no-instrumentals performance began with Lee Taehee\u2019s lead.</p><br/><p>A bittersweet voice that contained a deep reverberation roused the open hall. A monitor, placed to one side of the stage, caught the judges fixing their postures. It wasn\u2019t only the judges but the spectators in the seats, and even the staff stopped talking and turned to look at the stage.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung\u2019s lively tone added life to the song, and LJ\u2019s rap was so powerful and strong that my shoulders went up and down without me noticing.</p><br/><p>However, the most surprising part was Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>During this time, I had seen Lee Songha practicing a few times, but she was currently better than any of those times. It was to the point where I thought that effort didn\u2019t betray you. Those who weren\u2019t familiar with her may think that this much skill wasn\u2019t worth getting in a fuss, but I knew that this performance was the result of endless effort.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only Lee Songha, all four of them poured all the time, sweat and effort they had spent practicing since the moment the mission was announced into these 3 minutes and 40 seconds. They didn\u2019t make any mistakes, and their performance made you forget that there weren\u2019t any instrumentals.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. This is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, who was in front of me, mumbled in an excited voice. I nodded my head as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like she really did get rid of her bad luck this morning. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d do this well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once their performance ended, the girls waited for the judges\u2019 evaluation as they calmed their breaths. The girls were obviously nervous, but even I, who was watching from afar, was quite nervous as well.</p><br/><p>Cha Suzy raised her mic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was really good. I\u2019m curious why you weren\u2019t popular until now. Why didn\u2019t you become popular?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the girls, who were waiting on top of the stage for their evaluation, brightened at the compliment that exceeded their expectations. Even our side was in a festive mood. Kim Hyunjo hit the traitor\u2019s and my shoulders with his excited palms, and I was too excited that it didn\u2019t hurt. I currently didn\u2019t care about the Sugar Cats grumbling behind me in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaehee is really too good. No, I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re too good to be an idol, but it\u2019s just I want to listen to you sing the song for the full 3 minutes and 40 seconds by yourself.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung balances out the team well. Your tone and even your image. Above all, even though you aren\u2019t very tall, you catch people\u2019s attention as if the camera is zoomed in on you. It\u2019s because you absorb 120% of your choreography. Looking at your record, I want to quickly confirm the entertainment sense you\u2019ve shown in variety programs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if the underground community hasn\u2019t heard of Neptune, they know LJ. So I was inwardly eager to see you, but after I seeing your performance, it was beyond my expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Simon Lee and Producer Song Baekjin exchange some generous compliments. After every comment, the girls would express their thanks in proud expressions. It was to the point where the mood on the stage couldn\u2019t get any better. Light expectations brushed over Lee Songha\u2019s flushed cheeks. I gulped down my saliva and perked my ears up as well.</p><br/><p>Cha Suzy raised her mic.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou alone lowered the team\u2019s average. Are you practicing properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost stood up.</p><br/><p>I thought there was nothing I could do about criticisms about skill. I still didn\u2019t know much about music, and these people had at least ten of years of music experience, so, of course, their words were right.</p><br/><p>However, asking whether she practiced properly or not was being too cruel to Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>She was someone who always stayed behind to practice some more after the girls had finished practicing and returned to their residence. To make matters worse, Simon Lee and Song Baekjin also added in,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a bit regretful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour visuals are too good. Since you\u2019re so eye-catching, my vision keeps going to you, but when I look at you, there isn\u2019t anything beyond that. It would make more sense if you had a record in acting or entertainment, but that\u2019s not the case either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince she has the basics if she increases her practice time from now on\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s head drooped. A camera caught her expression as it was displayed on a stage monitor. The camera director may have expected to see tears, but she was silently enduring their cold-hearted evaluations.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo rubbed his face. Unable to calm my complicated heart, I simply sighed. All of a sudden, I realized that the voices behind me suddenly became brighter. Because we didn\u2019t want to show Lee Songha their deceitful figures, we got up from our seats.</p><br/><p>The girls came down from the stage. Although they ended up with a much higher score than the average team, they weren\u2019t cheerful. A cameraman stubbornly asked Lee Songha questions, but when she showed no signs of crying, he left soon after.</p><br/><p>When Lee Songha came close, Kim Hyunjo patted her slender shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, I said it before, right? The words the judges are saying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s fine, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Since this is the beginning, you just need to show that you\u2019re improving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha smiled faintly as she nodded her head.</p><br/><p>Seeing her face, I suddenly thought.</p><br/><p>How many times had Lee Songha said she was fine today?</p><br/><p>The recording ended well after midnight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a week left until the next recording, so don\u2019t practice today and go home and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo requested. The girls nodded heavily and got in the van. I was thinking about whether to sit in the passenger seat or at the back when Lee Songha slowly approached me from behind and grabbed my clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne second.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I took a few steps towards in the direction she was pulling, she looked around and mumbled in a small voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy foot hurts a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly looked down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts? Since when?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I fell.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was after she fell\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me it was back during their rehearsal in the rain? That was so long ago. Didn\u2019t that mean she didn\u2019t say that she was hurt since then?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t tell the unnies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha tightly held on my clothes with both her hands and prevented me from moving. Dumbfounded, I looked at her, but she shook her head.</p><br/><p>That moment, I recalled the conversation we had on our way back from the morning schedule. They talked about thinking of it as getting rid of her bad luck and that it would have been more troublesome if she got hurt and it affected their Next K-Star schedule.</p><br/><p>If the girls somehow found out that Lee Songha was hiding the fact she was hurt, they might blame themselves. That was probably why Lee Songha was so desperately asking me now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it. I get it, but I need to tell the chief. We need to go to the hospital. I\u2019ll come back after telling the chief so let go. My clothes will rip.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did her white-knuckled fingers loosen up.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Meaning he felt refreshed like drinking soda.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-38\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 38\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-40\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 40\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201190\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

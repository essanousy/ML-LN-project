Are you interested in small investments?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I licked my lower lip and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to mobilize everything I can to invest in this movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer\u2019s gaze alternated between me and the scenario. He looked like he was faced with a dilemma.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m so taken by the project that I want to invest in it, obviously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo taken\u2026 Please wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer jolted up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTen minutes\u2026 I\u2019ll come back before the ice melts!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Having rushed down the hall, the project producer entered the CEO\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! What great timing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The SBE CEO said with a serious face nested on top of his locked hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou remember \u2018Dating Time at 3rd Period\u2019. The one we rejected because it wasn\u2019t fun? Apparently, Watermelon Pictures picked it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Watermelon wants to film that? I guess we really are in a scenario famine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do if it\u2019s a success?\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO tapped his toes on the floor. His actions exuded how anxious he was. As his confidence and ego reached the skies after Alive\u2019s revolutionary success, he was becoming more distressed every day under the pressure that his next project had to be a success.</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about it again, I think it might have been good. Why did you have to reject it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me to reject it! Your standards have shot up after Alive became a success! Also, the \u20183rd Period\u2019 or whatever, it\u2019s not good. If it becomes a hit, then that CEO used the luck of his ancestors. No, that\u2019s not the issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chatting project producer waved his hand. Then he placed both hands on top of the CEO\u2019s desk.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung Sunwoo from W&amp;U is here right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is he looking for a good scenario again? I wish there was one too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he brought one over today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO\u2019s eyes widened. The project producer told him about the short conversation he had with Jung Sunwoo and all the information he was quickly able to find about City Jungle. The CEO, who had been nodding his head while listening, shared his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow really? Was there nothing else to be obsessed with? Is he crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the same thing, but I suddenly thought about what a reporter had said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Making Film and Pretty Girls\u2019 big hit, which resulted in an almost syndrome-like phenomenon, countless people have been talking about Jung Sunwoo. The project producer recalled the remark he heard on a late-night cable entertainment show.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough W&amp;U\u2019s Jung Sunwoo occasionally takes crazy actions, those actions always ended up being an incredible success, so you can\u2019t call him crazy. If he does something crazy next time, I wish I could participate as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO\u2019s face soured.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 shall we listen to what he has to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung Sunwoo from W&amp;U, what was his reaction?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ant Capital employees across from him asked.</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan nonchalantly chewed on his sushi as he replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was really good? He was more positive than I expected. He said that he would give us a call after looking over it with Ms. Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone like Lee Songha would be great! She has that hype factor and will do well in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that it would be good if he didn\u2019t swear at us for reversing Nam Joyoon\u2019s casting offer. It seems Team Leader Jung Sunwoo was quite taken by your short film?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I think he liked it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team Leader Jung Sunwoo he had met at the afterparty acted very amiably towards him. Even though there were other directors who exceeded him, like those who won the grand prize and the excellence award, he felt that Jung Sunwoo was particularly interested in him.</p><br/><p>It was well-known that Team Leader Jung Sunwoo recognized people who would be successful.</p><br/><p>That was why he had thought that he might be able to get Jung Sunwoo to immediately sign on if he talked to him face-to-face, so his actions were slightly disappointing.</p><br/><p>Of course, he couldn\u2019t say that. He first had to prove his skill and worth to the investment company employees in front of him. If he couldn\u2019t, then he would lose the director position he was finally able to get.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work, Director Joo. But did he have nothing to say about the change in directors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he seemed to easily accept it. Well, directors get changed in the middle of production these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Hwang said while rubbing his chiseled jaw.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe movie production company can\u2019t refuse our demands because the project will be overturned if we pull our investments. They don\u2019t have any other investment distribution companies either. Nor do they have partial investors. Therefore, our words hold the most sway. No matter how much Director Oh Hyunkyung endures, you\u2019ll be the one directing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the opportunity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan bowed his head. His lips were subtle trembling due to his excitement. He had his debut project in his hands. It wasn\u2019t an independent film but a commercial one to boot.</p><br/><p>Although his confidence took a blow after bowing down to moneylending investors, it had its value. He was able to take Director Oh Hyunkyung\u2019s edited scenario and position in one fell swoop thanks to it.</p><br/><p>He planned on making City Jungle a success.</p><br/><p>If he is able to make a box office hit once, production companies and investors will stick to him for his next project. Also, he could make those who didn\u2019t even give his scenarios and directing skills a glance regret not working with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will work hard in making the move to make you not regret investing in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Hwang\u2019s eyes narrowed into slivers as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Joo, do you know the return on national movie investments?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the negatives. -7%. You know that commercial films that released last year? The ones with at least a billion won in budget, not overall costs. According to the Korean Film Council, half of them flopped without being able to recover their budget. Only 16 actually reached their breakeven point. Investors go crazy about that. But do you know why they still invest\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Hwang placed the City Jungle scenario, which was in the seat beside him, onto the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are occasionally big hits. Not a large-scale blockbuster that every investor wants in on. Ones with good scenarios but lack public appeal or trendiness. Ones people don\u2019t have an eye one like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Hwang continued while tapping on the scenario with his chopsticks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf something like this succeeds, we\u2019ll get a 200-300% return. This is why we are investing in this. That\u2019s why, please work hard in making it. It is why we changed the directors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan frowned. Director Hwang continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re better than a director, whose past projects failed, you aren\u2019t really a great pick either. We decided to bring you in as the director as you were the writer of the original scenario and told us that you would be most cooperating. If things don\u2019t seem to work out, then, like you said, directors could change mid-production.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Do not worry. I am confident in making the film a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan said with a crooked smile.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t plan on being swayed by the investment company like this. He planned on quickly bringing in other investors. If the number of investment companies increased, then Ant Captial\u2019s stake and influence would shrink.</p><br/><p>He also had bait to lure other investors.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, who was receiving a lot of attention from investors with his Midas\u2019s Hand title. Lee Songha, the international star that created hype whenever she decided on a project. If he put those two out there, other investors would undoubtedly be interested.</p><br/><p>Also, Director Joo Jaechan was confident in persuading Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The two people across from me were boring holes in me with their eyes.</p><br/><p>The project producer, who rushed out, returned in ten minutes like he said. Along with the CEO of SBE Films. He seemed to have looked into the situation around City Jungle, as his expression was stranger than before.</p><br/><p>The project producer started the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI looked into it, and the production situation is a complete mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><br/><p>A production company that couldn\u2019t assign a director they wanted due to the sway the investment company\u2019s move had.</p><br/><p>The fight between an unknown director and a rookie director, who argued the project was theirs.</p><br/><p>To be honest, it was surprising that a project being produced in a situation like this to have had such box office appeal and quality. This was probably why people said projects fated to succeed would succeed even if covered in crap, while project not meant to succeed could not no matter how hard they tried.</p><br/><p>I let out a breath and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that the situation is a complete mess, however, it\u2019s a project I would like to bring in. I believe the film\u2019s potential will greatly increase once the environment improves. That is why I was hoping to actively intervene and create that environment.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my fishing rod with my quiet voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cA good environment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, if a skilled production company joined.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the project producer briefly before turning to the CEO.</p><br/><p>\u201cOr looking for a trustworthy joint production partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA joint production.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO rubbed his chin. He didn\u2019t look completely uninterested, so I explained in more detail.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe film production company, Forest, started off as a mid-sized import distributor, so they had many lacking areas in terms of production. That is why they are very open to joint production.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying they were very open to it was a bit of an understatement. When I asked Forest\u2019s CEO on what he thought about a joint production, he held onto my words like they were a lifeline. While their profits would be split if it became a joint production, but he seemed more interested in splitting the burden.</p><br/><p>The CEO, who had been silently listening to me, crossed his arms and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile we would have to read the scenario again, vaguely remembering it, it didn\u2019t really pull me in. I think the scenario was good, but because there isn\u2019t a lot of popularity for noir genre films in the country, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a box office success. Comedy-dramas are mainstream right now, and this one is too dark.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMainstream? You\u2019re the one who created a zombie film with tens of billions of won and an all-star cast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO coughed at my words. I saw the corners of his lips rise. I heard he liked the review about how he persevered and pushed a nonmainstream movie to success while other production companies came out with mainstream movies that standardized the industry.</p><br/><p>Anyways, I also came here because the CEO had a hand in various different genres.</p><br/><p>On top of that, the project producer, the production producer, who was on Alive\u2019s set, as well as the investment support team that mediated investment companies. They all knew the industry like the back of their hand and were highly skilled.</p><br/><p>The project producer asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re actively intervening, then are you going to decide the leads?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am. Or else, there is no need to be so aggressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their ears perked as they leaned towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are still discussing it. I\u2019ll let you know once it\u2019s been decided. It\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer\u2019s eyes narrowed at my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you gone to other production companies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to SBE first. I was thinking about going to Well-Made if I got rejected here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO cut me off and picked up the scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk after reading the scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, but I heard that two directors are vying for the megaphone? While the scenario is one thing, due to the characteristic of the genre, the directions of the director are very important as well. Depending on their directing skills, it could go from being \u2018charismatic\u2019 to \u2018corny\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded while replying. The project producer said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you decided which of the two you will have direct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason for rejecting CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s offer was because I wanted to walk my own path instead of one someone else created for me. In order to not be swayed by the opportunity, but instead use it to my advantage. To not be swayed by my future visions, and instead, use them.</p><br/><p>Did I want to make this project?</p><br/><p>I did. It wasn\u2019t simply because it was a success in the future. I sincerely wanted to.</p><br/><p>Then how did I want to make this project?</p><br/><p>What would I have done if I didn\u2019t see the future?</p><br/><p>My heart raced as I thought this. Then, I decided to take a different path from the one my future visions carved me. I stepped onto an uncertain path. I thought that the path would disappear and would be dark, but that was not the case. After stepping off the path, I could see countless paths at my feet.</p><br/><p>A path that could lead to failure. A path that could lead to even greater success.</p><br/><p>Under these uncertain circumstances, I was certain of one thing.</p><br/><p>Each step I took was more enjoyable.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan and Director Hwang from Ant Capital entered the restaurant together.</p><br/><p>This was a meeting to decide on our next steps now that the City Jungle director has been decided over a meal. They also planned on bringing up the topic of lead roles to Team Leader Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Joo, you said you haven\u2019t heard back from Team Leader Jung Sunwoo yet, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it seems he\u2019s planning on bringing it up when everyone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Team Leader Jung Sunwoo reserved this restaurant, so I think we can consider it a certainty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan laughed heartily at Director Hwang\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The restaurant employee who guided them opened the sliding door. There were already a few people sitting inside. The two greeted them as they entered but stopped. Beside Forest\u2019s CEO, who was sitting rigidly, seemingly nervous, was Director Oh Hyunkyung.</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan spoke in an irritated voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Oh, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo talk about the film, of course. Do you think I came to see you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung said, raising her eyebrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, what I mean is, why are you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan barely managed to contain his voice. He saw the people sitting across from Director Oh Hyunkyung. Team Leader Jung Sunwoo was sitting next to some people he was seeing for the first time.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Jung Sunwoo shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s here. Shall we discuss the film now?\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-204\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 204\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-206\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 206\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201515\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

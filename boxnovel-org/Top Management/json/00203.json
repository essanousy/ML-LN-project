What are you trying to do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Oh, don\u2019t act like this outside. Let\u2019s go inside the meeting room-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you embarrassed that rumors will spread that this is a mess? If you know that, then why do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. Let\u2019s sit and calm down-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I can calm down? How can you do this to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one in frenzy was Director Oh Hyunkyung. She was almost yelling with hostility. The film production company CEO was stuck in the middle with a pale face soaked in cold sweat. It seemed he was trying to calm the fires as best he could, but Director Joo Jaechan poured oil to the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t he? You signed the contract and handed over the production rights for that scenario to the film production company. Then it\u2019s their right to decide who to give the megaphone to. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already decided that I would be the one directing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was no clause about it in the contract though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO! You promised to leave it to me! City Jungle is my project!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I would like to\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to get to the nitty-gritty, then it\u2019s my project! I\u2019m the original writer who wrote the first draft! All you did was take it and embellish it a little!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? You rat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The argument quickly became a dog fight. They acted like they were the victims.</p><br/><p>I pushed the brim of my hat down. I acted like a spectator who was hesitating on whether to call 112 or not. The employees were so dumbstruck that they didn\u2019t have the time to concern themselves with a spectator next to the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Oh Hyunkyung. This is a business matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone joined in with a sigh. It was a man wearing a suit and sitting on an empty table. He seemed to a man of influence as they immediately quieted down. Their gazes were all focused on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, we have decided that, unless it\u2019s a famous director, it would be better to go with a rookie director who won an award at a film festival than Director Oh. The picture will be good since he\u2019s also the original writer. There have been cases where a director\u2019s debuting film becomes a huge hit and people cause a fuss about how he\u2019s a monster rookie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that the film is a success. How about we settle this matter peacefully with you handing the megaphone over to him and getting credited as an embellishment writer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung\u2019s face turned red and pale at the man\u2019s words. The film production company CEO went over and said something to him, but he was steadfast with his decision. Director Oh Hyunkyung tried her best to persuade him and finally said with a desperate face,</p><br/><p>\u201cI have currently made an offer to W&amp;U\u2019s Team Leader Jung Sunwoo to cast the male lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung Sunwoo? Is he interested in the scenario?\u201d</p><br/><p>My name was suddenly brought up. Their reactions were immediate. Director Joo Jaechan\u2019s eyes were wide open, and the CEO seemed to be in a sticky situation. Finally, the man in the suit, who seemed to be part of the investors, rushed in like a hyena that found a piece of meat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow far have the talks progressed? Does it seem positive? Who are you discussing for the male lead? Seo Jijoon? Im Joowon? Or the one everyone\u2019s up in arms about, Song Inho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe became famous with Alive. Don\u2019t you know him? He received praise as a scene stealer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man tapped his phone like he was searching for Nam Joyoon\u2019s profile before frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Are you planning on filming an independent film? Who\u2019s going to invest billions of won in a project with an unknown director and a supporting-role-level, washed-up rookie? There needs to be something we can put our hopes on. And here I was thinking you had some casting skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man harshly ridiculed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think the movie will be successful if you cast any actor as long as you have Jung Sunwoo promoting you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not any actor. He\u2019s someone I decided after careful deliberation. I saw all the independent films he\u2019s appeared in and his image fits well with the male lead. He\u2019s also good at acting..!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so frustrating. If that was enough, then everyone would pick up theater actors from Daehangno and use them. Why would they bother pouring tons of money to try to get a top star? That\u2019s enough. CEO, if our director-change proposal doesn\u2019t get settled, then we\u2019re going to withdraw our investments and leave. You can look for other investors. Nam Joyoon\u2026 Now really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, Director Joo Jaechan joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cI met Team Leader Jung Sunwoo at the short film festival afterparty. He seemed particularly interested in my projects. I even received his business card. He said that he really enjoyed my short film and to contact him if I had a good project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan glanced at Director Oh Hyunkyung before boasting,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try talking to him this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The film production company, Forest\u2019s CEO, peeked into his office as he wet his dry lips. He saw the back of a man sitting in a chair through the opaque window. Seeing his dark appearance, he looked like loan shark coming to collect money.</p><br/><p>The huddled employees pushed the CEO\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurry me. I haven\u2019t organized my thoughts yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the ice in the coffee completely melted while you were organizing your thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>After realizing this, the CEO placed the two mugs down and handed it over.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both melted. Go make them again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey look fine for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a flood, how is it fine? Quickly, no, slowly go make them again.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending the employee off, he pressed his chest and let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as I thought I could take a breather after sending the directors and investor off\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe probably came because of City Jungle, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he like the scenario? I heard he\u2019s picky when choosing projects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s for other top stars. It\u2019s for Nam Joyoon. Since he received a male lead role after now finally becoming slightly known as a supporting actor, this opportunity probably appealed to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do if he wants to sign a contract right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The employees became silent at the producer\u2019s words. Their gazes gathered on the CEO, but he was busy shaking his leg and wiping his sweat with a handkerchief. He looked like he was about to have a mental breakdown and collapse. The employees continued talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to decline. Is there anything else we can do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a joke. What if our relationship with him sours because of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can we do when we might lose our investments? To be honest, the reactions of other investors will probably be the same. We all opposed the idea in the beginning. We were simply persuaded by Director Oh Hyunkyung because of how confident she was.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if we say that we are in talks with other actors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we get caught, we will be cursed to hell. Why don\u2019t we blame it all on the investors? That they were causing a fuss about how they didn\u2019t like the actor. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to whine about how much of a tough situation we\u2019re in?\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO, who was slumped in one corner, nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go with that. Producer Lee, you go and talk to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s only right for an influential man like you to talk to him, CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, the CEO held two newly made cups of iced coffee and entered his office. His guest, Jung Sunwoo, who seemed to be lost in thought, got up after sensing someone was in the room. The CEO felt his fluttering heart squeeze. His guest seemed to have more influence and dignity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Yes, you must have waited a long time. We were trying to quickly find some ice. In case you were hot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo made smiling eyes as he accepted the coffee. The CEO squeezed into his chair and glanced at the man in front of him. He looked younger than he thought. Since he was supposedly twenty-eight on his profile, he was young in reality as well.</p><br/><p>To be a team leader at a company like W&amp;U at his age. He probably didn\u2019t have to brown-nose anyone with all those talented actors he had under him. After tasting a bitter taste in his mouth, the CEO got to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why did you contact\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of the City Jungle scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you contact the director first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know which director to call out of the two.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO flinched in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the production situation is chaotic right now. If that\u2019s not the case, then we can immediately talk about cast\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is chaotic. We aren\u2019t in a situation where we can begin casting yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO did his best to beat around the bushes now that he saw his opportunity. Jung Sunwoo listened while reacting back. The CEO initially thought that there would be an arrogant side to Jung Sunwoo since he was on the path of success at such a young age, but he was unexpectantly very respectful. The CEO\u2019s nervousness quickly dissipated.</p><br/><p>At some point, his mouth was rambling on.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m in a pinch. When I think of loyalty, obviously we should work with Director Oh Hyunkyung. Director Oh worked so hard trying to create this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that she even took out a loan to pay a sizable amount for the rights to the scenario. However, the director who wrote the first draft seemed to have somehow talked to the investment company, as they suddenly called for a change in directors\u2026 It really was a bolt out of the blue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Joo Jaechan persuaded the investment company?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fellow went around to different production and investment companies after receiving an award at the film festival, but his synopsis was rejected. He was rejected by the investment company we are working with, and it seemed he saw the City Jungle scenario over there. He decided to force his way in after finding out that the rights were signed over to the film production company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen which investment company is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo lightly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe investment firm, Ant Capital. We are in discussion for a 5-billion-won investment, so if we can\u2019t get them, then the production immediately falls through. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can just readily switch out the director. Once we start to get swayed, we\u2019ll probably be swayed by the investment company throughout production\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sighing, the CEO suddenly came to his senses and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil this is settled, there is going to be a stop on casting. Sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo, who was lost in his thoughts, asked in a courteous voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cTheirs is something I want to propose.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was quickly flipping through the last half of the scenario when an employee quickly approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cA director has come looking for you. Again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I asked if he had an appointment, and he said that he\u2019ll wait until you had free time.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a second, I thought that Director Oh Hyunkyung had come again. She had called me a few times, but I had manually replied that I was in the middle of a meeting. I was wondering if maybe she couldn\u2019t wait any longer and had come to the company again, but the name that came out of the employee\u2019s mouth was different.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he was Director Joo Jaechan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou told me to tell you whenever I had a good project.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan said in the exact same place Director Oh Hyunkyung sat not too long ago. Their expressions had a similar side to them as well. Especially their passion-filled eyes.</p><br/><p>His mood seemed different every time I saw him. He looked well-mannered at the afterparty. And he seemed like a completely different person when he argued with Director Oh Hyunkyung. His gaze now was very similar to his future self.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis scenario. I believe you\u2019ve received it from other channels.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took out a scenario from his backpack. Or it was besides the empty director field.</p><br/><p>It was a scenario I was familiar with.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I read it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a project I had held onto for a long time since I was a student. I had certain circumstances which led its rights to be handed over for a while. That was why I couldn\u2019t bring it up when you asked if I had any other projects. Now the situation has changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>His heated voice was filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be the one directing this film.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot Director Oh Hyunkyung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe will be taken off the project and will have her name under \u2018Script Embellisher\u2019 in the credits. I\u2019ll be the one directing. I heard that you met with Director Oh once, but I had something I wanted to say about casting.\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes darted quickly as he examined my reaction before he added,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, back when I was an aspiring director, this scenario was pretty much snatched from me. I couldn\u2019t get a good price for it either. That is why I couldn\u2019t say that it was a scenario I wrote and completely regretted my decision, but it finally returned to its rightful owner. I will put my life on the line\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I flipped over a few pages as I listened. There was no need to look at it. There was not a single character missing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scenario is the edited version?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first draft you wrote.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan replied nonchalantly,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are pretty much the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I asked the film production company and received a copy. The first draft with no title. I\u2019m reading it right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled the scenario I was halfway done reading as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are completely different projects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are completely different projects.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-202\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 202\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-204\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 204\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201513\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

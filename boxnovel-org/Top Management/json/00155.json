Chief Lee, tell me.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, that is\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>-So there is something? Let\u2019s meet and talk in person. How\u2019s lunch?</p><br/><p>He was talking to a producer who had seemed to find him annoying when he went around cable networks handing out coffee to promote Pretty Girls and had never spared him a glance. He had never heard him act this friendly before.</p><br/><p>Although this situation may have once moved him, his face was currently pale. If this place wasn\u2019t the girls\u2019 residence and if the girls were looking at him with nervous gazes, he might have already passed out due to his difficulty breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, I have something urgent right now, so let me call you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Promise me, Chief Lee! Chief Lee!</p><br/><p>He hastily hung up, but the phone rang again. He didn\u2019t know this phone number.</p><br/><p>He hesitated before answering,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe-hello?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Is this Chief Lee Taeshin of Pretty Girls? I\u2019m a reporter from Today Star. I am contacting you about the post on social media. I\u2019m currently preparing an article, but I wanted to confirm the truth with you. Would you be okay with an interview?</p><br/><p>Her voice was pleasant like a customer support representative\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin was taken aback by her words but steadied his breath before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cAn interview is difficult as nothing has been confirmed.\u201d</p><br/><p>-So you are saying that the post isn\u2019t completely baseless?</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, I can\u2019t say anything right now. Please refrain from publishing your article.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shoved his phone in his pocket after barely managing to persuade her. His phone immediately began to vibrate again, but he ignored it. Instead, he borrowed the girls\u2019 phones to try to call a few people. Unfortunately, they were all busy.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, is Chief Jung not answering his phone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. W&amp;U\u2019s PR Team\u2019s representative is busy on the phone as well. It seems that reporters are swarming there as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do? Isn\u2019t this a big problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>The members were frozen with pale faces as they held each other\u2019s hands. Their hands were trembling. They were overwhelmed with joy that they cried as they told their families the good news, yet they looked like they were on the verge of crying from fear.</p><br/><p>It was all because of an unknown high schooler\u2019s post.</p><br/><p>{I heard this from someone who heard it from someone else, but there\u2019s a girl group called Pretty Girls who debuted two years ago. But I think W&amp;U\u2019s Jung Sunwoo is planning on making a reality TV show with them? I don\u2019t know the details, but I think it\u2019ll be fun if he\u2019s trying to get them to shine.}</p><br/><p>The post was deleted not long after it first went up, but like most rumors, it spread like mold. Screenshots of the post spread throughout the internet, and there were even speculative articles. He even received calls from reporters asking if this was true. All of this happened in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s our fault. This happened right after we told our families.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe told our families not to tell anyone. Who did that person hear it from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe someone heard our call? My dad was outside when I told him. He kept asking me if I was sure I wasn\u2019t being scammed and if I saw Chief Jung Sunwoo with my own two eyes. Someone might have heard that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe we told our families for nothing. We should have waited a bit longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh Yeondu held Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s shirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, could this all fall apart because of us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Chief Jung said that you could tell your families yesterday. Don\u2019t worry too much. W&amp;U will probably publish an official release soo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He checked published articles as he tried to calm them down. Tabloid articles poured out when he searched \u2018Pretty Girls\u2019. He couldn\u2019t believe it. He slowly looked through the articles until his eyes suddenly bulged.</p><br/><p>{Exclusive} After discovering unknown actor Nam Joyoon, W&amp;U\u2019s Chief Jung Sunwoo sets his eyes on an unknown girl group next?</p><br/><p>\u2026 Someone from Pretty Girls\u2019 side disapproved of the sudden rumor as he expressed that \u2018it wasn\u2019t 100% confirmed so an interview is difficult.\u2019 He spared his words, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t say anything right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an article for Today Star. They had published his words to add credibility to the rumor. Whatever remaining blood was drained from Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s face. It was to the point that the girls were trying to calm him down.</p><br/><p>He flopped on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I got a call! A call!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh Yeondu hastily handed him her phone. Jung Sunwoo\u2019s phone number was on the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes, there were so many reporters calling me that I was only able to see that you called just now.</p><br/><p>His voice was hoarse and irritated.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m sorry. I think my voice is a little hoarse because I\u2019m tired.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin barely managed to steady his teetering heart.</p><br/><p>Clearing his throat, Jung Sunwoo\u2019s voice now sounded normal. He sounded calm like usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, did you see the article?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I just saw it. I also saw an exclusive from Today Star.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin bit his lip.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person quoted in that article is me. I was on the phone with the reporter just now, and I think I didn\u2019t handle it properly. I asked her to refrain from publishing the article, and I didn\u2019t think she would publish it right away. It\u2019s my first time in a situation like this. Could there be a problem because of that\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, no. In fact, it was good. Very natural.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo told Chief Lee Taeshin, whose face was stiff from confusion.</p><br/><p>-It blew up quicker than I expected. If I knew it would blow up this quickly, I would have told you yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you\u2019re saying that the post was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He heard a laugh affirming his suspicion.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin got in a taxi. He felt like he would cause an accident if he drove in his current state. When he paid the fare and got off, he was standing right in front of W&amp;U\u2019s enormous building. He blankly stared up at the building before jolting to his senses.</p><br/><p>He took out his phone to tell him he arrived. He had ignored his constantly vibrating phone on his way here that it was now full of missed calls and messages. There were even former Pretty Girls members, Park Hyojin and Yoon Bora, who had signed with NK Entertainment, in his call log.</p><br/><p>He tapped the most recent message from them.</p><br/><p>-Chief, why won\u2019t you answer the phone? What\u2019s with all these articles?</p><br/><p>-The articles about Pretty Girls, they are talking about us, right? Where are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone greeted him. Chief Lee Taeshin quickly turned around.</p><br/><p>Gently drooping eyes, and a figure like that of a security guard. It was Road Manager Lee Kwanwoo, who he had seen once with Chief Jung Sunwoo before. He was carrying a coffee tray and convenience store bag in each hand.</p><br/><p>Putting his phone back in his pocket, Chief Lee Taeshin offered to help.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. This isn\u2019t much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo moved his hands to show he was fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came for the meeting, correct? I\u2019ll guide you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease feel free to speak casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m only a chief by name. I\u2019m no different from a road manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, you are older and have more experience than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really okay. This is comfortable for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin scratched the back of his head.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo led him to the elevators. Chief Lee Taeshin was entranced by the LED screen displaying W&amp;U celebrities\u2019 profiles before turning his gaze towards Lee Kwanwoo. He looked calm like the fuss on the internet was nothing.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, Chief Lee Taeshin was also able to regain some of his composure.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo knocked him back down by saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Pretty Girls will hit first on real-time search ranking soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe real-time searching rankings. The one on the portal site.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin gulped.</p><br/><p>Getting first place on the real-time search rankings was a huge improvement for unknown celebrities. This was why some attempted noise marketing by posting questionable behavior on social media or wore very revealing clothes. However, it wasn\u2019t easy staying first with that.</p><br/><p>There was an incident when Pretty Girls momentarily got first. It was due to their high school and apron outfits back when they first debuted. However, Chief Lee Taeshin couldn\u2019t get them back on there no matter how he tried afterwards. He couldn\u2019t even dream about getting first.</p><br/><p>There was no way Chief Lee Taeshin wasn\u2019t shocked since Lee Kwanwoo mentioned something like that so nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they get first, how long do think they\u2019ll stay there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt worst, they\u2019ll probably stay there for the whole da\u2026 Are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin forced himself to breathe. He grasped his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe. I guess things like that aren\u2019t much around here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019ve just become used to it since it happens often.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOften\u2026 W&amp;U\u2019s PR Team is truly amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur PR Team is amazing, but the power of our chief\u2019s name is incredible as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo said naturally before coughing out of slight embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin glanced at him.</p><br/><p>When the elevator stopped on the fourth floor, Lee Kwanwoo took the lead. The lounge was filled with exhausted employees, and there was an office with the name place \u2018Management Business Department Team 3\u2019. It also had a completely filled schedule.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin was distracted by his surroundings but returned to his senses at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reporters are asking for Pretty Girls\u2019 promotional material, should we send that as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a bit. How are people reacting to the reality TV show?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA few subcontract production companies have contacted me, asking to work together if the rumor is true. Cable networks and PBS seem interested as well. PBS is a bit tough. Though they are gentlemen when compared to IBC.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIBC hasn\u2019t contacted you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019ve probably understood the situation after seeing the articles, so they are probably discussing what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess they should know others have approached us as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should have a rough idea. They also have quick senses.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meeting room was noisy. PR Team employees were tapping their keyboards with their phone wedged between their cheek and shoulder. Jung Sunwoo and Team Leader Park were discussing matters.</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought coffee and snacks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo placed the coffee tray and snacks on the table. Vigor returned on the people\u2019s faces. Jung Sunwoo grabbed a hangover drink instead of a coffee and downed the bottle in one go. Then he saw Chief Lee Taeshin.</p><br/><p>He quickly got up to welcome him.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin sat down after Jung Sunwoo introduced him.</p><br/><p>After being told that IBC\u2019s general manager made absurd demands when they approached him with the reality TV show proposal and that they had to release an article to flip the situation, Chief Lee Taeshin gulped.</p><br/><p>A power struggle with a public network general manager.</p><br/><p>As someone who had difficulty exchanging words with a production assistant, just hearing about it made him shiver. His hands and feet grew cold when he thought about what he would have done in a similar situation.</p><br/><p>He glanced at Jung Sunwoo. He seemed laid-back like normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we went to IBC because we had nowhere to go. We simply wanted to let them know out of politeness before we released the article, yet they wanted to strip us of everything we had. I guess I look like a bit of a pushover. Maybe I should shave my eyebrows or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>A female PR Team employee opposed his suggestion while still on the phone. The meeting room was bustling with laughter.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin couldn\u2019t adjust to this situation and awkwardly raised the corners of his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we check their reactions now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo made a call on speakerphone. Only ringing could be heard in the now silent meeting room. Someone answered within ten seconds. Jung Sunwoo silently laughed as though he had been expecting this reaction.</p><br/><p>-Chief Jung?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the late reply. Did you happen to see the articles? We were so busy trying to handle them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He groaned naturally. He seemed so skilled as though this wasn\u2019t his first time doing something like this. Recalling how easily he made a comment to a reporter on the phone, Chief Lee Taeshin rubbed his throat.</p><br/><p>Producer Choi Byungsoo also groaned.</p><br/><p>-There were tons of articles speculating about the reality TV show as well. General Manager Hwang has been urging me, telling me that it would better if we finished yesterday\u2019s discussion and released an official release about it. He\u2019s so impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we haven\u2019t finished discussing it internally though. It\u2019s because of the articles. We also received some requests from other production companies and networks asking us to send them the show proposal as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>-\u2026 Is that so?</p><br/><p>\u201cThey offered better conditions than IBC so I\u2019m in a bit of a bind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other side was silent. This silence continued for a while.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin shifted his eyes. Everyone was staring at the phone. However, he was the only one nervously bating his breath. They all looked like they were curious about Producer Choi\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019ll try talking to the general manager again. I\u2019ll try my best. But, chief, if you move to another network in this situation then that\u2019s a bit\u2026 The general manager already picked a main producer for the show.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes, so there\u2019ll be a huge fuss if he finds out you are considering other networks. He might hop up and down telling me to kick Seoyoung and LJ off Good Friends. This will be a bolt out of the blue for them when they\u2019ve been working so hard on the show.</p><br/><p>It was a threat veiled as a concern.</p><br/><p>As soon as the call ended, Jung Sunwoo exhaled while laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey keep bringing up the girls. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve taken them hostage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the majority of entertainment shows on public and cable networks are a sausage fest, there aren\u2019t really any shows two girl group members and join like Good Friends. At most, their roles will be to sit and clap like pretty little displays.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are being more aggressive because they know there aren\u2019t any programs as good as Good Friends for them. What a bunch of highway robbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin unknowing nodded in agreement. Having no program to appear on was a common concern amongst girl group managers. If the Neptune members were kicked off the show, there would a line of girl groups waiting to take their spots.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be for the best if IBC retracts their absurd demands, but what are you planning on doing if they don\u2019t back down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to go our separate ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo said without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cG-go your separate ways? Are you really going to go with a different network? What if IBC retaliates by actually kicking Neptune members off their show\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin, who had been stuttering because of how taken aback he was, suddenly widened his eyes. Jung Sunwoo was calm even though he brought up the worst-case scenario. Not only that, the people around him didn\u2019t seem worried either.</p><br/><p>Eyes bulging, Chief Lee Taeshin asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you start all this planning to have the members leave the show?\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-154\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 154\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-156\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 156\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201422\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

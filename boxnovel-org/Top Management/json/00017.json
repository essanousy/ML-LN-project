How should I describe it? It was sort of like seeing someone pop out of a TV.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Manager is Jung\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m Jung Sunwoo. My business cards haven\u2019t come out yet, so I don\u2019t have anything I could hand you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it hasn\u2019t been long since you\u2019ve started working?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s my second day at work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Yoojeong was surprised.</p><br/><p>Compared to the dignified Director Park who seemed to have been through a lot, the twenty-something-year-old Park Yoojeong was a bit clumsy and wasn\u2019t good at controlling her expressions.</p><br/><p>For this woman in her twenties who is in the bottom of the food chain to become a strong director in twenty years.</p><br/><p>You really couldn\u2019t tell how one would change in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the same as you. I\u2019m a new recruit as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve started. Though it does feel like I\u2019ve worked here for a long time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoojeong\u2019s expression looked complicated and tired. Well, to get dismissed by her senior in front of people, if I was Park Yoojeong, I probably would be in a corner talking to myself \u2018I\u2019m going to succeed in this dirty world, fuck, fuck\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI look forward to working with you in the future, Miss Reporter. You\u2019ll be the first person I hand my business card to once they come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoojeong hesitated before saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to continue being a reporter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to quit. I can\u2019t deal with it anymore. I don\u2019t think it matches me either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Really? To me, it looks like you\u2019ll be successful as a reporter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Really.</p><br/><p>She laughed out loud when she heard my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhahahaha! \u2026Cough, cough. Even if they are empty words, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t. I\u2019m serious. If I could, I would even bet on it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><br/><p>She suddenly came closer.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Since I am going to quit anyways, I\u2019ll let you in on something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice quieted down to a whisper.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Hwang, Report Hwang Junggu. He\u2019s complete trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the type where if you tell him one thing, he\u2019ll write ten things about it. And Lazy who was interviewed before you wasn\u2019t late because he was sick. It became late because Reporter Hwang Junggu gave him the wrong time. When I told him that we had to do Neptune\u2019s interview, he said that Lazy was more important than some new unknown group and to tell them to leave. I was only able to barely convince him by saying they were appearing on Next K-Star and that there was a lot to talk about. For him to push his way in even though he didn\u2019t even know who Neptune was just a while ago, it\u2019s obvious. He\u2019s going to involve Lemon Girls and Next K-Star and write an exclusive article with a bunch of MSG.\u201d</p><br/><p>I blankly stared at her. It looked like she was completely relieved that get that off her chest.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 She\u2019s saying Reporter Hwang Junggu is trash?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince W&amp;U is a large company, the PR team will be able to bring the article down as soon it\u2019s up. However, it only takes a moment for Urakkai articles to flood the internet and if that happens, even if your PR team could fly, they wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. Search Reporter Hwang Junggu and girl group Happy Candy.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took out my phone and looked it up like she said. An article Reporter Hwang Junggu wrote not too long ago popped up. Even the headline made me gasp.</p><br/><p>[New girl group \u2018Happy Candy\u2019 unhappy being known as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Seraphic]Happy Candy was a girl group I had never seen before while Seraphic was a well-known top girl group with 10 years of experience. For them to be known as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Seraphic would have brought criticism, but to feel unhappy\u2026 Just what were they thinking saying that?</p><br/><p>As expected, the comment section exploded with insults. When I searched the girl group without Reporter Hwang Junggu\u2019s name, several articles came up with only slight deviations to the original content.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they really say that during the interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. When he asked them, \u2018You must not feel good being constantly compared to top seniors like Seraphic,\u2019 they replied, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>The nuance was completely different!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the article was released, their manager came and pleaded him to change the headline, but he was ignored. Their company was small. And this wasn\u2019t the only time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just where did this trashy guy come from?</p><br/><p>Was this the incident that made the girls receive a lot of insults?</p><br/><p>Considering the influence of an article, it definitely could be possible\u2026 Anyways, the girls should be trying their best in the interview right now without knowing anything, I needed to talk to Hyunjo about this and find a countermeasure.</p><br/><p>Ah, I need to thank Report Yoojeong first.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Reporter, thank you for the information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. I am really sorry about the office pantry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you that it was fine. Then let\u2019s meet again next time. Ah, also, I almost forgot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought about it before saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould I be able to contact you if anything newsworthy comes up?\u201d</p><br/><p>For example, if that Lemon Girls\u2019 manager held a grudge and came swinging his fists at me?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You can just call m\u2026 No, I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d</p><br/><p>She gave me a skeptical glance. I smiled and without any more words, ran towards the interview room.</p><br/><p>Inside the interview room, the interview was still going on. When I entered, Seoyoung was explaining every detail of their album concept.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, one moment please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>I made the most serious expression I could. Hyunjo stopped the interview momentarily and came out. I closed the door and told him exactly what Yoonjeong said a few steps away from the interview room. Hyunjo\u2019s face instantly distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure? How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>I guess it was best to keep it anonymous?</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it from an insider. This as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>I showed him the article I searched a while ago. Hyunjo who read the article in an instant glared at the interview room.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, that trash reporting bastard really\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it might not be the case, this time, isn\u2019t it best to be prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s too late if we wait until the article is released. I\u2019m going to call PR team leader Park so you go and talk about nonsense and buy some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>I faithfully followed Hyunjo\u2019s orders. When I went back inside, I talked about how the scent of the soap in the washroom was to my preference for 3 minutes.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Hyunjo returned and the interview resumed. I didn\u2019t know what he talked about with Team Leader Park, but he definitely was more careful with the answers. Every little detail about their current condition was answered by Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Reporter Hwang Junggu concluded the interview.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your hard work. Now let\u2019s go to the studio to take some pictures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Reporter has worked hard as well. Please take good care of the article.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>We went to the studio that was inside the building and took individual and group pictures that would go up with the article. Afterwards, the interview had completely ended.</p><br/><p>As Hyunjo explained everything on our way back, the van became rowdy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really could have been in big trouble! I was wondering why this oppa kept talking about the washroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seoyoung frowned as she grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat reporter, his questions did seem a bit strange. Does he have some sort of grudge against us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that. He\u2019s just trying to write a more provocative article to get more clicks. He doesn\u2019t care what happens to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScary, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut will we really be fine? Won\u2019t the article be all weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>As LJ worried, Hyunjo nodded his head as if telling her to relax.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Park says she\u2019s on friendly terms with their Entertainment Director. She said not to worry as it will be handled without any hiccups.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that trash reporter hands in a strange article, they are going to reject him and tell him to write it all over again. He\u2019s not the director or anything so what can he do when his superiors reject his article?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was like I was seeing an aspect of a huge food chain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will remember that reporter\u2019s name and keep as far away from him as possible from now on, so don\u2019t worry. But, Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was fixing my tangled seat belt when I turned my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you just incredibly lucky or is it something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, it was something else. Well, of course, this time, I really was lucky as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been bringing good stuff since yesterday. How did you meet an insider on your way to the washroom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seoyoung poked her head out as she seconded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Didn\u2019t you meet Producer Joontae on your way to the washroom yesterday too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, wow! It looks like this oppa has a good aura. Let\u2019s stick closely with this oppa. Oppa, just pack your bags and come live with us!\u201d</p><br/><p>My face was hot.</p><br/><p>I mean, it wasn\u2019t like I was the one who said I wanted to, but why were their stares\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung, it\u2019s time for your medicine. Stop talking nonsense and just sleep if you\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ kicked Seoyoung\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense, there some truth behind it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTruth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mom went to a skilled shaman not too long ago and asked when we would be successful. The fairy said that we would be very lucky at the end of this year. She said a snake will bring luck and to tightly grab hold of it to not lose it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Seoyoung made a fuss, the members had no reaction. Seoyoung quickly became glum and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true\u2026 She said we need to grab the snake\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But, I did have an idea about the snake\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you born on the year of the Snake?\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor who was driving abruptly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was born then. And since we\u2019re both the same age\u2026 Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo laughed in the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it. Why are you guys joking around so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Then you both were really born on the year of the Snake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. 1989, the year of the Snake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>The back was silent for a few seconds before becoming noisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah, creeeeepy\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I silently rubbed my shoulders as well.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this foresight ability was more common than I thought?</p><br/><p>We met with the staff of Next K-Star at night.</p><br/><p>Since it was an expensive beef restaurant, I thought the staff had a large budget, but it turned out the first bill would be paid by W&amp;U. I heard it was incredibly high quality, but because of constantly pouring and drinking alcohol, I didn\u2019t get the chance to truly savor it.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the atmosphere was very good the whole time. It looked like the members left a good impression on the staff. And they seemed to have shown off their unique personalities.</p><br/><p>The meeting that started at the beef restaurant continued on to the second and third place and we finally ended past 3 a.m. After seeing off the completely drunk producers and writers, we once again got on the van.</p><br/><p>The traitor who protected his liver while Hyunjo and I were constantly receiving drinks took the driver\u2019s seat. After we dropped off the yawning girls at their residence, there were three people remaining like yesterday.</p><br/><p>Wow, that was yesterday\u2026 It felt like a month.</p><br/><p>Now that the long day was over, all that was left was to rest at home.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys worked hard today as well. Tired, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo talked with a slur.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly go home and sleep and eat something good in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to work by 7. We have a lot to do tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t make the same stupid mistake of repeating his words. Only\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChief. Could I just sleep at the company?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m going to sleep there too. Then let\u2019s go together! The sleeping quarters at the company are pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed as I followed Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>Damn, I need to escape from here as soon as possible.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-16\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 16\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-18\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 18\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201146\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Then he greeted the director and me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hello team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Our eyes met during the short time we shook hands. Maybe it was because he became an upstart star beyond his expectations or because he had difficulty facing the CEO, but Song Inho looked tenser than normal. His hand was stiff and cold.</p><br/><p>When I put more strength into my grip, his mouth opened and closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader urged him. As if being sent aside, Song Inho sat in an empty seat.</p><br/><p>The mood was quite peaceful. The director fussed and praised Song Inho\u2019s achievements. CEO Baek Hansung looked pleased as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s work? I bet it\u2019s hectic since it\u2019s your first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung asked. Before Song Inho could open his mouth, the Team 2 Leader replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that it still feels surreal, but he\u2019s following very well. Now that we\u2019ve made a good start, I\u2019ve picked out a few dramas for his next project. I was planning on showing you some proposals when you had some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDrama?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to expose his face more through dramas before his popularity cools.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you have a project you\u2019re interested in?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung asked Song Inho. Once again, the Team 2 Leader replied for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cInho hasn\u2019t seen them yet. I decided to show him once I\u2019ve narrowed it down to one or two choices. He doesn\u2019t have an eye for projects yet, so he might something strange if there are a lot of choices. Also, since he\u2019s already busy with other stuff, it\u2019ll only complicate things for him more if he looks at multiple projects. Isn\u2019t that what managers are for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader added in a rambling manner. That it was all for Song Inho. He looked like the stereotypical image of a helicopter parent. Song Inho didn\u2019t just look exhausted, he looked lethargic. He wasn\u2019t the type to make such a gloomy expression.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung stared at Song Inho. He soon retracted his gaze.</p><br/><p>When the mood reached its peak, the Team 2 Leader\u2019s shoulders spread wide as though they were waiting for this moment. He held his nose so high that he almost did a flip. His proud gaze fixated on me and the director. It looked like the appearance of a secret royal inspector. I guess Song Inho was like the royal badge?<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>Unable to contain it, the director clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Team 2 Leader, you really do have a good eye. I admit it. I\u2019m sorry for doubting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you like this all of a sudden? I\u2019m blushing. Did I say anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of your prickly gaze. Narrow-minded fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s face, which wore a content smile, crumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNarrow-minded? Should we really bring everything up? To be honest, you\u2019ve hurt me a lot. When I picked a rookie with my discerning eye, you asked me why I picked Inho over Nam Joyoon and whether I rejected him because Jung Sunwoo brought him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really? When did I ever say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how you said it. There are even crazy employees who placed bets on Nam Joyoon and Inho. Didn\u2019t this all start with you? Inho, he must have suffered a lot of hardship by being unwittingly involved in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director avoided his gaze when he brought up the bets. The Team 2 Leader\u2019s gaze was now directed at me. Although he wasn\u2019t openly putting on airs, his eyes were drunk with anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it before. To trust my discerning eye. Nam Joyoon isn\u2019t a bad actor. Only, if I had to pick one of them to be W&amp;U\u2019s rising star, I judged that Inho had much more potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader proudly patted Song Inho\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. The results prove it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was speaking to the director, his eyes were still on me. He raised his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam\u2026 Leader Jung, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you also thought that the reason I picked Inho over Nam Joyoon was for my own personal revenge. That\u2019s why you held a grudge against me. You acted so boastfully when Alive was released, but have your thoughts changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>I scratched my chin before taking a sip of my now cooled coffee. The Team 2 Leader\u2019s gaze intently followed my face like he didn\u2019t want to miss a single change in my expression.</p><br/><p>I fully understood his feeling. This was probably the most refreshing and delightful moment.</p><br/><p>He probably ground his teeth thinking of a way to screw me over since the meeting, and Song Inho happened to rise to prominence. He likely considered Song Inho as a priceless lucky charm.</p><br/><p>How much did he look forward to this moment? From igniting the public\u2019s interest in Song Inho, moving the press, until the title \u2018upstart star\u2019 was given to Song Inho. He likely waited for this moment as he added oil and fanned the flames the past week.</p><br/><p>The moment he could show Song Inho off in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t acknowledge it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I decided to boost the Team 2 Leader\u2019s delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true I held a grudge against your decision. I had thought that I inadvertently involved Joyoon hyung, Mr. Nam Joyoon, because you looked at me in a bad light.\u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s be honest, I was partly right.</p><br/><p>I licked my lower lip and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cI did, but I now acknowledge it. Your eye in picking Mr. Song Inho and your decision-making skills. The public is making a fuss about Song Inho right now, so there\u2019s no way I can\u2019t acknowledge it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I glanced in front of me, and the Team 2 Leader\u2019s eyes glimmered with joy. Almost as though I was on my knees, giving him the highest praise. His cheeks jiggled and beard trembled like he was barely holding back from laughing uproariously.</p><br/><p>Was this the Team 2 Leader\u2019s peak? Had he reached his peak?</p><br/><p>I glanced at Song Inho before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe he\u2019s a great actor with a lot of potential. To the point that I want him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the point you want him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he seems more desirable every time I see him. That\u2019s why\u2026 Please give him to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader made a dazed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Song Inho. I really want to work with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You bastard? What kind of nonsense is that? Jung Sunwoo, are you crazy? Did you lend Inho to me? For you to ask me to give him to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader wheezed out a laugh. I turned my gaze. Song Inho\u2019s eyes were wide open. The director was completely focused on the situation as if there was nothing more worth spectating that this.</p><br/><p>And CEO Baek Hansung was smiling.</p><br/><p>He looked happier now than he did looking at Song Inho, who was considered a rising star.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t lend him to you. It\u2019s similar. I did request the CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe CEO?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s gaze quickly turned. The air tensed.</p><br/><p>\u201cRequest? CEO, what nonsense is he saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told Team Leader Jung that, if he could persuade Chaeyoung to sign onto another project, I would let him fill his team with whoever he wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader jolted to his feet. The hair on his face stood straight from anger.</p><br/><p>I was curious. How it felt for the ground to collapse as soon as you reached the peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re planning on snatching Inho and handing him over to him? What the hell kind of situation is this?! I picked and raised Inho! He\u2019s my child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Again, with the \u2018child\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days since you promoted him to team leader as a reward for succeeding a project! But what are you giving him for persuading Chaeyoung? If things are like this, shouldn\u2019t there be a reward for me, who made Inho W&amp;U\u2019s rising star?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit different.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director scratched the tip of his nose as he joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, since Team Leader Jung had huge hits with Royal Family and Alive early this year, should he be a director? The CEO had been waiting for an opportunity to promote him and simply used the project as a pretext. The CEO separately made a request regarding Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, this isn\u2019t right! Aren\u2019t you stabbing me in the back for him?! CEO, aren\u2019t you too biased? Isn\u2019t this why people in the company are spreading rumors about how he\u2019s your son?!\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung laughed when he heard those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are rumors like that? Team Leader Jung, how old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-nine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible with a twenty-year difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO!\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung waved his hand at Team 2 Leader\u2019s outburst.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down and sit. I won\u2019t split up good partners for no reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless the actor wants to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho\u2019s eyes widened once more. The Team 2 Leader\u2019s gaze alternated between CEO Baek Hansung, me, and Song Inho. Just as he was about to shout, the director nonchalantly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you acting like this? Don\u2019t you remember how you and Chief Jo barged in and asked to manage Lee Songha? He said that he would think about it if Lee Songha agreed. If Chief Jo persuaded Lee Songha, then her manager might have long since changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector! This and that are completely\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different about it? If Song Inho doesn\u2019t want to, then that\u2019s that. Why? Do you not trust your child?\u201d</p><br/><p>At a loss for words, the Team 2 Leader clenched his jaw.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow shall we hear what the person in question has to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung gestured at Song Inho. As more gazes focused on him, Song Inho clenched his fist, which had been quietly sitting on top of his knees. His fist was clenched so hard that his knuckles turned white. CEO Baek Hansung tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it too sudden? Do you need time to think about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho opened his mouth but closed it once more.</p><br/><p>Something was off.</p><br/><p>I sent Song Inho a look that everything would be as he wanted with his reply.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as his gaze met mine, his face distorted like someone who held all the worries in the world. His eyes reddened in an instant as tears dripped from his eyes. I had seen Song Inho cry a few times, but this was the saddest I\u2019ve seen him.</p><br/><p>I raised my coffee cup. I tightened my grip on it.</p><br/><p>I could feel CEO Baek Hansung and the director\u2019s gazes on me. Asking me what was going on.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know. I was wondering that too.</p><br/><p>Did he have a change of heart? If that\u2019s the case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cInho!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader hugged Song Inho\u2019s shoulders in a comforting manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crying? It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shot a displeased glare at us.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow really. How shocked and taken aback must he be to cry? He\u2019s still young. He was already stiff before coming to the CEO\u2019s office, do you think he won\u2019t be shocked being caught in the middle of the CEO and director?\u201d</p><br/><p>He clicked his tongue before shooting me a gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbove all, Jung Sunwoo\u2019s a team leader. How can he not be cautious? Maybe if one was thick-skinned, but he\u2019s not so daring to reject an offer. He\u2019s too soft-hearted.\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze landed on Song Inho in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, so just speak what\u2019s on your mind. You just need to trust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho spread his arms. The Team 2 Leader also spread his arms while smiling gently.</p><br/><p>Immediately, Song Inho hugged\u2026</p><br/><p>Me.</p><br/><p>It was so rough that it felt like my bones were breaking. It felt like I was caught by a giant squid. I let out a breath and looked past Song Inho\u2019s shoulder. The Team 2 Leader still stood with his arms spread. He seemed to still be processing what just happened.</p><br/><p>The corners of my lips rose. I had been looking forward to this moment like the Team 2 Leader had before.</p><br/><p>The moment the Team 2 Leader\u2019s mood hit its peak before falling.</p><br/><p>Smiling, I patted Song Inho\u2019s trembling back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crying? Do you not want to work with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Of course, I want to work with you! I do, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t I be unable to be an actor anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho said tearfully. His voice was of worry and resignation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? Why can\u2019t you be an actor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Team 2 Leader raised me up this far. If I follow someone else, people might say I\u2019m ungrateful. They say you won\u2019t be able to work if rumors like that spread since the entertainment industry is so small. If you want to act for a long time, you need to mark those words\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the Team 2 Leader said that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho quickly nodded at my question.</p><br/><p>That moment, the Team 2 Leader, who had been blankly staring in our direction, crumbled.</p><br/><p>And here I was wondering if he had a change of heart. He had been waiting to work with me like a child at an orphanage waiting for his parents. I was wondering why he was acting like the world was ending rather than being happy. It seemed like his mind was filled with the Team 2 Leader\u2019s words, which were no different from a threat.</p><br/><p>My lips unconsciously made a crooked smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll handle that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I patted Song Inho\u2019s back and looked at CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO, can I tell you more actors I would like to bring over to my team? I have already gotten their agreement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Who? Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung propped his chin up as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s just consider it as me helping the Team 2 Leader whenever there is an issue with Ms. Son Chaeyoung. I\u2019ll feel really bad if I brought over W&amp;U\u2019s poster star. I\u2019m not that insolent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the Team 2 Leader\u2019s distorted face as I smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Seo Jijoon and Mr. Im Joowon.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Similar to an undercover cop revealing his badge.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-192\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 192\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-194\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 194\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201500\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

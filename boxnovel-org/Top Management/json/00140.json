Two million for the first week!\u201d</p><br/><p>The SBE Film CEO shouted while slamming the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few strands of wispy hair remained on his chin. He had lost so much weight that his eyes were sunken with large dark circles. He made people recall the zombies on the poster. The employees, who also struggled through the rigorous schedule for the past few months, were the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cHollywood blockbusters are waiting like a shoal of piranhas. National movies opening on the same day are strong competitors as well. People don\u2019t wait long these days. We need to break through with the first week\u2019s score or else\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur screen time would be taken by the shoal of piranhas.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer said with a frown.</p><br/><p>As if he just imagined it, the CEO\u2019s legs were shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cMarketing is key, marketing! If we want to pull in as many people to watch it in the beginning, we need to pour all our efforts into marketing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have been releasing press releases every day starting last week.\u201d</p><br/><p>The PR Team employee, Kang Minjeong, said with a partly hoarse voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have advertisements on buses, subways, and billboards as well. Our main trailer already has 4 million views.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. How are the comments?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe production team made an amazing trailer. There\u2019s no way the comments will be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production producer blinked his sunken eyes as he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe put our soul into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to that, we\u2019ve received comments like these.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019The trailer is everything. Since I\u2019ve seen it, I probably don\u2019t need to watch the movie.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence hung in the meeting room. Soon, a suppressed laughed escaped. As though it was infectious, laughter quickly spread throughout the room. The zombie employees all had meaningful expressions on their faces as they laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019The trailer is everything\u2019? They don\u2019t even know how much we didn\u2019t show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough that was what we were going for, I want to tell them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what their reactions will be once they see the movie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? I want to invite them all to the preview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the reporters were curious about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong twirled her pen as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were asking why we were offering so many free previews. They were wondering if we weren\u2019t worried that our opening score will be negatively affected by word of mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly those who aren\u2019t confident in their work worry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told them. That we were doing it on purpose to get some word of mouth marketing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong\u2019s red lips curled upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe previews will be the fuse. Once word of mouth spreads, we\u2019ll boost our marketing efforts and bring up the sales for the premiere. The people who watched in on opening day will spread it through word of mouth again. It\u2019ll snowball from there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are the press and VIP preview preparations going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong looked at the list of guests at the CEO\u2019s question and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be as splendid as a film festival. We sent tons of invitations to Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s personal connections and friends of our cast. Even if only half of them attend, we\u2019ll be all over entertainment news columns.\u201d</p><br/><p>After informing them of a few top stars who would be attending, Kang Minjeong added,</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune will be there, and Seo Jijoon agreed to come as well. Chief Jung Sunwoo said he\u2019ll talk to the leads at Royal Family today so if we\u2019re lucky Yoon Taekyung, Seo Eunkyo, and Im Joowon could come too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Royal Family starts this week, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s its first broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO licked his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll benefit if Lee Songha becomes even more of a hot topic. I hope their ratings are great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope so but it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? From the rumors, it seems the quality is good? China seems to be excited about it as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe project is good, but they have bad luck with their competitors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompetitors?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll probably have a rough night.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>PBS\u2019s drama director swore.</p><br/><p>A chill smacked the inside of the director\u2019s office. The chief producer in charge of Royal Family, Director Sung from Well-Made Productions, Writer Jang, and Director Woo. They were all sighing with frozen faces.</p><br/><p>It was because of the ratings chart on the table.</p><br/><p>Two lines were highlighted.</p><br/><p>{IBC\u2019s \u2018Benz after the Crappy Car\u2019 Episode 2. 15.8% national ratings.}</p><br/><p>{UBS\u2019s \u2018Afterlife\u2019 Episode 16. 11.8% national raitings.}</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you add those two together, their ratings exceed 27%. What do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? Why did you schedule things like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Writer Jang said while brushing her hair to the side.</p><br/><p>The pearl earrings hanging from her ear shook violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe needed to start at the same time. Don\u2019t you know that we\u2019ll be at a disadvantage if we start late? Drama performances are set after the fourth episode. Young viewers these days don\u2019t watch on air dates if they miss the previous episode. They wait to binge watch it after the drama ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWriter Jang. I\u2019m the director here. How could I not know this? If those immoral bastards didn\u2019t scheme, all three companies would have started new dramas at the same time!\u201d</p><br/><p>The director beat his chest. The chief producer quickly opened a bottle of water and handed it to the director. Having dealt with the enraged director the entire day, the chief producer said with an exhausted face,</p><br/><p>\u201cIBC feigned ignorance before suddenly getting the jump on us, and UBS suddenly extending their originally 16-episode series to 20 episodes. It seems they worked hard to compete against us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief producer cautiously said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we weren\u2019t doing anything either. We ended \u2018It\u2019s Fate\u2019 a week early for Royal Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you were planning on ending it early anyways because its ratings were only at 4%. It wasn\u2019t \u2018It\u2019s Fate\u2019 but rather \u2018It\u2019s Dead\u2019<sup>{1}</sup>. If you\u2019re going to take credit for something, make it believable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief producer crumbled at Writer Jang\u2019s harsh words.</p><br/><p>Director Woo, who had been silent for a while, scratched his beard as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this after our first episode airs. We marketed as much as we could, and there are viewers waiting for our drama. Is there a reason to be so negative already? Well, we can also increase our viewership through other channels as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Writer Jang said with the click of her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIBC\u2019s \u2018Crappy Car\u2019. People are going crazy over how great the chemistry is between the male and female leads. They ended their previous episode at such a great cliffhanger too. Also, \u2018Afterlife\u2019 is a genre-specific drama. Their viewers are extremely loyal so they probably won\u2019t go watch something else. If we can\u2019t get the ratings tonight, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood in the room became even gloomier at Writer Jang\u2019s words. Like a boat that was about to sink. Just then, Director Sung from Well-Made Productions, who was monitoring IBC and UBS\u2019s Wednesday-Thursday drama reactions, put his tablet down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re really unlucky\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He laughed bitterly as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ve made an amazing drama that will flop.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>I recalled the first night Cat Guardian Ghost aired.</p><br/><p>The staff and cast had gathered to watch the broadcast that time too.</p><br/><p>It was loud and full of anticipation. People were glancing at the clock with expectant faces. Alcohol glasses clinked endlessly. Meat cooked on the grill. And the cheers that erupted after they reported real-time ratings.</p><br/><p>I remembered how the drama\u2019s first broadcast was like a festival.</p><br/><p>Compared to that, this was the Intensive Care Unit.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it would be a funeral in an hour.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this all of sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Crappy Car pretty much splashed crap on us. Why did they have to hit 15% ratings on their second episode? There wasn\u2019t anything to see!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t public broadcast dramas take up at most 35% ratings these days? If IBC and UBS take 27%\u2026 We really might have to start from the bottom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, I thought we would easily exceed 10% on our first night.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff and employees who had gathered for the broadcast whispered to each other. Even the leads, Yoon Taekyung, Seo Eunkyo, and even Im Joowon emptied their glasses with tense faces. The mood at the bar dropped below the ground, even reaching Earth\u2019s inner core.</p><br/><p>In fact, even the behind-the-scenes team that planned on filming the scene had placed their cameras on the ground and raised their beer glasses.</p><br/><p>The situation was just as frustrating as high our expectations and goals were.</p><br/><p>I was fiddling with my glass when something soft touched my shoulder.</p><br/><p>It was Lee Songha\u2019s head. It seemed she was voraciously eating fried chicken moments ago, but she was now sleeping with her round forehead and cheek leaning against my shoulder. With a fork in her hand.</p><br/><p>She had been falling asleep on our way here, but it seems she reached her limit. She probably didn\u2019t have much time to sleep easy having to attend marketing events for both her movie and drama.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t filming anything for the behind-the-scenes clips, and there was still some time before the broadcast.</p><br/><p>I decided to let her sleep a bit and covered her with my coat.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Joowon was chewing on a dried squid tentacle across from me.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s uneasy, yet it seems you and Songha are completely fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>People\u2019s gazes slowly landed on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Mr. Sunwoo\u2019s been quiet for a while now for some reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, is Ms. Songha sleeping right now? While everyone\u2019s this anxious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t sleep properly for the past few days because of her busy schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>People were astonished at my excuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, she has nerves of steel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe can sleep easy because Chief Jung isn\u2019t anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Sunwoo, aren\u2019t you worried? If our ratings aren\u2019t good, isn\u2019t your image as \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 ruined?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? Reporters and netizens are incredibly curious about what will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Joowon leaned his face closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you foresee our ratings being good? Is that why you\u2019re so calm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s it, tell us! I might die from anxiety!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo joke. Seriously. If you say that, I feel like I\u2019ll actually relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>At some point, people from other tables were staring at me as well. They urged my reply with sparkling eyes as though if I said that the drama would be a success, it actually would be.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know when, but Lee Songha had woken up and was looking at me while rubbing her drowsy eyes.</p><br/><p>Under their gazes, I wordlessly laughed.</p><br/><p>If I was honest\u2026</p><br/><p>I was so nervous my mouth felt dry. I felt like I would dry out.</p><br/><p>It was my first time waiting in such frustration. I had some degree of confidence that Next K-Pop Star and Cat Guardian Ghost would be a success. But the future was unclear this time.</p><br/><p>I was able to stop Royal Family from being a bust by stopping Park Dojin from being picked as the lead, but that didn\u2019t ensure success for this drama.</p><br/><p>IBC and UBS\u2019s sudden scheduling change was a bolt out of the blue for me as well. It felt like someone swung a baseball bat at the back of my head. After hearing this news, I was hoping that I could see another future. Anything.</p><br/><p>However, there were no signs of that happening.</p><br/><p>Even though I looked calm on the outside, I was inwardly more nervous than anyone here. Damn it. If I could pay some price to see the future, I would have done it already.</p><br/><p>My cheeks tingled. People were staring at me.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was also looking at me with slowly closing eyes.</p><br/><p>After downing a glass of beer, I casually said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we did everything we could.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re frustrated!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grumbles erupted all around me. Soon, the gazes on me moved towards the clock. 9:55. Royal Family\u2019s first episode would air in a few minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, look at this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha tapped her phone a few times before showing me Neptune\u2019s official social media page.</p><br/><p>-Euaah! Waiting for Royal Family to air! Everyone, please wait with us!</p><br/><p>There was a picture with a caption that was undoubtedly written by Im Seoyoung. A picture of the girls gathered in the living, each holding a slice of pizza. Behind their gathered faces was a commercial running on PBS\u2019s channel.</p><br/><p>When I went on the entertainment section of the portal site, it was pouring with Royal Family related articles. This was the result of PBS\u2019s marketing team, Well-Made\u2019s PR agency, and our W&amp;U\u2019s PR Team holding nothing back.</p><br/><p>Neptune\u2019s picture was already posted in an article. Not only that, but there were also pictures of Son Chaeyoung and Seo Jijoon, who made cameo appearances. Even supportive comments on Alive actors\u2019 social media accounts were picked up by reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like everyone is waiting for it to air.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said while stabbing her fork in a chicken drumstick.</p><br/><p>She looked no different from normal. Like me.</p><br/><p>What was she actually thinking?</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, aren\u2019t you worried about the ratings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did everything we could like oppa said.\u201d</p><br/><p>She replied as she offered the chicken to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd our luck is good. I think our ratings will be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur luck is good?\u201d</p><br/><p>When our luck couldn\u2019t be any worse?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked around before whispering in my ear,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I slept for a long time, but there\u2019s still a drumstick remaining.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she pointed her fork at me, urging me to eat it.</p><br/><p>I unknowingly began laughing. It was so ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha laughed along with me.</p><br/><p>Unconcerned whether people would think we were crazy, we laughed for a long time.</p><br/><p>I hoped everything would go well. Really. Unlike in the past when things didn\u2019t work out no matter how hard Lee Songha tried, I hope that she would be rewarded with great ratings.</p><br/><p>I wished that the future I had yet to see was something like that.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why is Crappy Car starting already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone exclaimed in a flustered voice.</p><br/><p>PBS was still running their commercials, yet IBC was already at their title screen. The text \u2018Third Episode\u2019 appeared on a black screen then the drama began right away.</p><br/><p>With a scene of the male and female leads running towards each other and kissing.</p><br/><p>They hugged each other as they crashed into the fridge, then the table. Plates and glasses were being shattered as they passionately kissed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is supposed to be a romantic comedy! Why are the leads kissing on the third episode?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTongue! I think I just saw tongue?! Isn\u2019t this worth reporting to the KCC<sup>{2}</sup>?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The audio director holding the remote quickly changed the channel. The female lead on UBS\u2019s channel was wailing. A collapsed body spilling blood could be seen on the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they kidding me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod damn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are they pulling here?!\u201d</p><br/><p>While angry voices erupted out, Writer Jang\u2019s drearily said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey want a fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The TV stopped at PBS\u2019s channel. Royal Family\u2019s first scene was playing.</p><br/><p>\u201cRatings! What ratings did it start with?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Writer Jang shouted.</p><br/><p>The production assistant, who already had his phone to his ear, raised his finger to his lips to shush us.</p><br/><p>The bar became so quiet one could hear a needle drop.</p><br/><p>Soon, the assistant opened his lips.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Korean pun. \u2018Passed away\u2019 and \u2018Fate\u2019 here use the same word phonetically.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> KCC \u2013 Korea Communications Commission, a media regulation agency.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-139\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 139\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-141\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 141\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201392\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

The streets had quite a bit of traffic and people were walking around.</p><br/><p>Unable to tell if they were going to or leaving from work, people were hastily walking on the streets early in the morning.</p><br/><p>On the bench in front of convenience store, there was a person drinking a can of coffee. A loosely hung necktie, messy hair and beside him, there was a suitcase. It might have been a daily routine for him, but it somehow seemed cool to me.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I was nervous or excited. Anyhow, it felt good. A student, a soldier, a part-time worker and a job applicant, this wasn\u2019t any of the \u2018half-jobs\u2019 I had till now, I had become a real salaryman.</p><br/><p>Going to an office, leaving an office and drinking coffee while talking about issues around the world with colleagues during our break, that kind of salaryman. That sort of a member of society. A working man.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll buy a car as soon as I save some money.</p><br/><p>The unique appearance of the W&amp;U, in-between similar buildings, caught my eye. In front of a glass door, I double-checked my appearance. I was wearing the suit my brother bought me as my graduation gift, the polka-dotted necktie and dress shoes my mom bought me. The dandy and favorable impression giving off a new employee look was verified by my nephews and my sister-in-law.</p><br/><p>I thought of the brief encounter I had with my older self in a dream. Compared to him, the present me looked sloppy. I looked much more composed and dignified in my dream.</p><br/><p>A CEO of a successful management company. A powerful man.</p><br/><p>My current self was a far cry away from the appearance in my dream. Well, probably because it was obviously a dream.</p><br/><p>Since I was a child, I loved movies and dramas. And I loved the actors that lived in that world. When I was in middle school, I filled my room with card stocks and postcards of Korean and International actors and actresses. In high school and university, I have filled my phone\u2019s photo gallery with them. Even when I was a soldier, my locker was filled with actresses rather than girl groups.</p><br/><p>I loved them and I yearned to be a part of their world.</p><br/><p>In the entertainment world.</p><br/><p>It was an obvious choice when I decided to partake in that world.</p><br/><p>The reason why I chose to become a manager instead of a celebrity was because of my personality. Instead of being in the spotlight, I found it more interesting developing someone who would stand in that spotlight. Even while watching movies and dramas, I found myself more focused on the supporting characters than the main characters themselves. The characters who moved within a story while not getting the attention.</p><br/><p>With my own two hands, I wanted to produce a top star who would be acknowledged not just within Korea, but throughout the world.</p><br/><p>Within the W&amp;U, I could learn and gain experience while working in the management team. And when I get older, I could liberate myself from the company with my actors and actresses and start my own management company, and become the CEO. Becoming the person who I was in my dream.</p><br/><p>That was my ambition.</p><br/><p>Today, I was able to make my first step towards my dream.</p><br/><p>I took a deep breath before opening the door and headed in. No one was there. It was even pitch black. There was only a blinking light in the direction of where I was headed.</p><br/><p>What floor was I supposed to go again?</p><br/><p>As I approached the front of the elevator, I heard the sound of a girl humming somewhere.</p><br/><p>Oh God. I might have gotten a heart attack. Shit, it was my ringtone. It was the soundtrack from a horror movie I was impressed by during the summer. I didn\u2019t think this song was that scary. Who the fuck calls at 3 in the morning?</p><br/><p>As I took out my phone, it was from an unknown number.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Are you Jung Sunwoo who is supposed to start work today?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>I bowed my head out of habit.</p><br/><p>\u2013 My name is Kim Hyunjo. I\u2019m the chief of Management Team 3, are you on your way?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just arrived, but what floor was I supposed to go to?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of the underground parking lot. I\u2019ll meet you there. We need to leave right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand. I\u2019ll get there right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly took the elevator. The mirror attached to the door reflected my face. A stiff, nervous face. I needed to make a good impression.</p><br/><p>I tried to force a smile while looking at the mirror. He wouldn\u2019t spit on a smiling face<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><br/><p>As I arrived on the 2<sup>nd</sup> underground floor, I heard a honk. A man came out of a black van. Some distinct features stood out.</p><br/><p>First, he was thin and short. His slender figure made him look like a student from a far.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, he had a haggard appearance. I wasn\u2019t sure if he just didn\u2019t shave properly or if he just didn\u2019t shave at all, but I was able to see stumbles on his chin. He had dark circles that stretched down to his chin. He seemed like he had went through all sorts of hardships to become an veteran manager\u2026</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect my supervisor to be angel-like, but he didn\u2019t seem like he had a good personality.</p><br/><p>As I took a look at Hyunjo, he glanced at me as if he was scanning me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Feel free to talk to me however you want, chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, this is more comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Also, the fact he said, for now, seemed a bit odd.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 You came dressed in a suit? Didn\u2019t someone remind you to dress comfortably as you would be working on the field right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No.\u201d</p><br/><p>I just received a message about when and where to go for my first day of work.</p><br/><p>Since it was my first day of work, I even took my time on deciding what to wear. But, looking at Hyunjo, he was wearing a sports jacket and jeans. He was also wearing a cap. He was dressed the complete opposite of me.</p><br/><p>I quickly removed my tie and shoved it in my bag.</p><br/><p>Hyunjo roughly scratched the back of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuit and dress shoes\u2026 If you work with those kids, you need to run around to take care of them all day long and most of the time you even need to wait for them all night long inside the van. But, you won\u2019t be able to work properly with a suit on. Starting tomorrow, dress more comfortably. Ah, even if I said comfortably, I will kill you if you wear stretched out sweatpants and squeaky slippers.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m doomed. How bad was my first appearance?</p><br/><p>\u201cComfortable, but not sloppy. Do you get what I mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I underst\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, that guy dressed properly for the job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking behind me, Hyunjo waved his hand. When I turned around, I saw a man who looked similar to my age. He quickly came out of the elevator and walked towards us. A man that seemed to be the kind of person who would kindly answer you when you ask for directions. A face which appeared to be smiling even if it really wasn\u2019t. He even had dimples. Shit, Shit.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Chae Gunyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jung Sunwoo. Hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo great to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After shaking hands, Hyunjo took a look at both, Gunyoung and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cBetween the two of you, I heard one had experience, it\u2019s Gunyoung right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gunyoung nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeel free to talk to me however you want, chief. It\u2019s embarrassing to say that I have experience. I worked part-time under Blackout manager hyung for 3 months. I only drove the van, did the chores and stopped people from taking photos, but that was all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s still good. Ah, then you should know Hojun hyung. Chief Lee Hojun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have met him a few times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blackout. As I heard it, it came to me. The successful boy group of W&amp;U, the \u2018ChoTongLeong\u2019 idol group. They were called Blackout. The company he worked part-time for 3 months was this one.</p><br/><p>Damn it. It seemed as though everything was crooked from the start. The outfit I spent a lot of time on was turned down and the new colleague I was compared to already had 3 months of experience.</p><br/><p>If I\u2019m not careful, he could be recognized as the sharp, fast, sensible, new recruit. And, me as the slow and insensible type of new recruit.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, both of you get in the van. We need to pick them up, get them to the shop<sup>[2]</sup> and drop them off at the music program rehearsal by 7am. Let\u2019s talk about more specific details on our way there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was too lost to realize what was odd about what he said.</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyunjo sat in the driver\u2019s seat and Gunyoung sat beside him. I moved quickly as I sat in the backseat. I quickly took off my jacket and shoved it in my bag, loosened my buttons on my shirt and folded the sleeves up right up to my elbow. It was only then my outfit looked a bit more comfortable.</p><br/><p>As the van entered the highway, we started to talk more about the specifics.</p><br/><p>The specifics that shocked my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting today, Gunyoung and Sunwoo will be in charge of the group called Neptune. They are a 4-member girl group that debuted early last year. Have you heard of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I listened to their single album not so long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gunyoung replied right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reactions didn\u2019t seem that bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad? The single dropped off the charts right away and disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Because the group members are all pretty, they were often talked about in an online community I go on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? They are really pretty. Since we were originally a company in charge of actors and actresses, when we decided to make a girl group, we decided to pick those with actress like appearance. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have the skills. They were mostly trainees for a long time in a different company. We even thought of the oversea market before choosing them so they are capable of speaking other languages. Since they have the basics, if they just make a hit, they will go a long way, but that hit didn\u2019t happen for the last two years. Are they just unlucky, or do we just not have enough experience with planning\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t able to cut in their conversation. I was completely lost.</p><br/><p>The girl group Neptune which debuted two years ago. I was in charge of a girl group instead of an actor or an actress.</p><br/><p>The things I heard from my dream were becoming true, they were really happening. Can this really happen? Is this what I think it is? A d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you, Sunwoo? Is this the first time you have heard of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>I made eye contact with Hyunjo through the rearview mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of my slow reply, he clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you look behind you and search through the index file, you will see it contains all of their profiles. Take one. Since it takes about 15 minutes for us to arrive at their lodging, take a good look at it. Or, search online. You need to at least know their names and their faces before meeting them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I lifted the index file, there were a couple of thick profiles booklets. I took one booklet out. Even if I was still a bit confused, my hands moved automatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Gunyoung, do you have any siblings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an older brother and a younger brother. I\u2019m the second oldest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m also the second oldest. The second oldest are usually more self-determined and quick-witted. For this job, the qualities you need the most are determination and quick-wits. It\u2019s not easy to constantly be with 4 young girls all day long. Do you have any siblings, Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I have one older brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the youngest? Thought so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thought so?</p><br/><p>My mind started.</p><br/><p>What was I doing right now? D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or not, this wasn\u2019t the time to think about my dream. Hyunjo was starting to think of me as a joke. If I don\u2019t straighten up my first impression right now, I\u2019ll have a miserable life ahead.</p><br/><p>I was worried that my life ahead will be full of hardships as I ruined my impression on the very first day.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>[1]</sup> Korean proverb meaning you don\u2019t mistreat someone who treats you nicely.</p><br/><p><sup>[2]</sup> Shop refers to a makeover salon, where celebrities get their hair and makeup done.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-1\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 1\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-3\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 3\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201116\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

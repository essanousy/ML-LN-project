Our CEO is currently talking with Well-Made Pictures about investments and distribution, and they said that they would like to discuss it with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell-Made Pictures?\u201d</p><br/><p>The wilting Forest\u2019s CEO was the first to perk up. Well-Made Pictures was one of the top investment distribution companies in the country. They were also the main investment distribution company for Alive as well.</p><br/><p>I readily replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well-Made Picture\u2019s building was in the middle of Gangnam. SBE Film\u2019s CEO, who had arrived ahead of us, was sitting in a large meeting room by himself. With his arms crossed and head down, he gave off a gloomy mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is your expression like that? I think we can consider this is a green light if they want to talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s CEO\u2019s eyes shot up at the project producer\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, back with Alive, we received a call an hour and a half after sending them the scenario. That their investment screening committee unanimously decided to invest. That is a green light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is different though. Alive was Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s work, and we had Lee Kihwan and Park Saeryung already cast. City Jungle is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Remembering Director Oh Hyunkyung and I were present, the chatting project producer changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, we need to try hard to persuade them. It\u2019s not like they are going to slam the door in our faces after making a lot of money with Alive, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he sat down, the project producer asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, CEO, what is the budget you thought about for City Jungle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe budget?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably crunched the numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung and Forest\u2019s CEO exchanged looks. Soon, Director Oh Hyunkyung answered as though she was applying for a loan,</p><br/><p>\u201c3-2.5 billion won.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c2.5 billion won?\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI read your scenario, and I don\u2019t think 2.5 billion is anywhere near enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can trim down the number of shoots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to jump straight into the deep end? If you set your budget too low and we exceed it later, we\u2019ll need to cling to the investor\u2019s legs and beg for more. Just say what the initial budget you calculated was.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 If possible, 3.5 billion won.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung cautiously raised the amount. The project producer scratched his chin.</p><br/><p>I listened to them discussing financial matters while drinking the coffee an employee got me.</p><br/><p>3.5 billion won at most. It fell short of the average commercial film budget.</p><br/><p>Well, this was because my first film was Alive, whose total production budget was over 30 billion won. Such blockbusters were rare. If I lowered my standards, there were many more films that were created below budget due to lack of funds.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Forest\u2019s CEO cautiously spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if we tried talking to Director Hwang from Ant Capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who mocked us by telling us to do whatever we want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, we were in talks for a 50 billion won investment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer firmly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold onto broken relationships. Also, Ant Capital wouldn\u2019t have given you all 50 billion won. Their methods are a bit malicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey come in as the main investor and act like they are going to invest the full amount, but they\u2019ll drop the amount when it comes time to sign the contract. That way, they hold influence and can sway you however they want. The production company and director have to film with the budget with tears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Forest\u2019s CEO\u2019s mouth was agape.</p><br/><p>The project producer continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we had prints and advertising to the 3.5-billion budget, let\u2019s go with 5 billion as the total budget. While it\u2019s normal to have 30-40% of it from investment distribution company and 60-70% from partial investors, we should be able to make up the difference with partial investors if we get Well-Made Pictures\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He swallowed his words.</p><br/><p>A man wearing a vintage pair of glasses pushed the door open with his shoulder and came in. He was the general manager of the Korean Film Production Department at Well-Made Pictures. I had seen him at the Alive press distribution screening. He had a notebook, files, and a copy of City Jungle in his hands.</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s CEO immediately asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was the meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO, let\u2019s sit before we discuss things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, please sit. How was the meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a hasty exchange of hands. Holding my hand last, the general manager asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any thoughts on changing the lead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the result of the meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked back.</p><br/><p>The general manager looked at the everyone before looking back at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were many comments about the director and scenario, but more people are against the male lead than anything else. With Ms. Lee Songha as the lead and SBE Film producing, investors will invest if the level of the male lead was increased. Perhaps other male actors from W&amp;U\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already handed him the scenario, and the actor agreed to do it. We can\u2019t overturn this and hand the role over to another actor in the company. We have never done it nor have we ever been asked to consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood became strange.</p><br/><p>I had never been treated like a piddling manager since Neptune was no longer considered a \u2018washed up\u2019 idol group and Lee Songha became an international star.</p><br/><p>Well, this was expected in this place.</p><br/><p>If I wasn\u2019t a team leader at W&amp;U and didn\u2019t have other actors in my care. If I was only the manager to Nam Joyoon, they wouldn\u2019t have been suggested his. All I would have been able to do is wait endlessly for the meeting results. I might not have even been informed that the male lead had been changed.</p><br/><p>This should leave a bitter taste in my mouth, but a smile crept up my lips.</p><br/><p>Fervor surged within me.</p><br/><p>Fervor to make the film a success and change people\u2019s opinions on Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, this is a scenario Director Choi Sungwon read and said was good.\u201d</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s CEO said while tapping on the City Jungle scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I told him the male lead, the artist, was Mr. Nam Joyoon, he said that there was a role he wanted Mr. Nam Joyoon to play in his upcoming work and that he needed to get a verbal agreement before Mr. Nam Joyoon\u2019s fame skyrockets with City Jungle\u2019s success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Here I thought SBE Film had agreed faster than expected.</p><br/><p>I should thank Director Choi Sungwon later. And make a verbal agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Is that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Well-Made general manager scratched his cheek. SBE Film\u2019s CEO continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a blockbuster needing tens of billions of won. The total budget for this is 5 billion won. It\u2019s not that big of a burden. You already have a space to fill in next year\u2019s lineup after Director Park Hyungil\u2019s work fell through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAce and AK Entertainment\u2019s lineups seem to be made up of similar works. Isn\u2019t Well-Made\u2019s motto \u2018variety\u2019? It\u2019ll be good to have a polished action noir flick in your lineup. Let\u2019s invest a small amount into its potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s CEO slowly talked Well-Made\u2019s general manager into it. Director Oh Hyunkyung was firm that she wanted Nam Joyoon as the male lead. Soon, Well-Made\u2019s general manager said in a half-convinced face,</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we do invest, it won\u2019t be a lot. Everyone\u2019s clamoring for more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to continue looking at venture capitals and financial companies. With Ms. Lee Songha as the star.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer glanced at me and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, since Team Leader Jung Sunwoo said he would actively help out, there\u2019ll definitely be more people enticed by this opportunity. We were able to easily promote Alive thanks to Team Leader Jung. He\u2019s more a hot topic now than he was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well-Made\u2019s general manager abruptly cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard this in the meeting just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Team Leader Jung Sunwoo developed a panic disorder due to the burden of picking his next project.\u201d</p><br/><p>I barely managed to hold onto my coffee cup. Other people\u2019s gazes turned odd as they looked at me. That rumor was like a cockroach. How was it spreading outside when we finally managed to quell it internally?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s spreading amongst directors and production companies? Discussions about Team Leader Jung Sunwoo are of highest interest in this industry. I heard that Director Cha Jaeho, in particular, has said it on multiple private occasions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who\u2019s working on Supernatural right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I heard Director Cha worked hard to get Ms. Lee Songha. It seems he was upset after being rejected. I think he\u2019s been saying how it was no wonder your sense of judgment fell after he heard you had a panic disorder. Having rejected the male lead, Mr. Heo Kakyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>These fellows\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are all false rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. The problem is, no matter how big or small it is, a false rumor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Well-Made\u2019s general manager clicked his tongue,</p><br/><p>\u201cWill have an effect on investors.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>While Well-Made Pictures was reviewing the investment, I attended multiple meetings SBE Film arranged. There were many who outright refused after seeing that the project had an unknown director and a supporting role male lead, but there were also some who were interested.</p><br/><p>And, whether it was as a joke or not, the investors always brought up the panic disorder rumor. It seems that the fact I chose City Jungle over other great works, including Supernatural, gave credibility to the rumor.</p><br/><p>It was to the point where I wondered if I should carry around a doctor\u2019s note saying I was fine.</p><br/><p>I even had reporters contact me about it. While the rumor didn\u2019t spread in the media thanks to the PR Team, this still resulted in a small wrench in my plans of using my title as \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 to bring in investments.</p><br/><p>While City Jungle\u2019s production issues were being handled\u2026</p><br/><p>I got on track to handle other actor\u2019s next projects.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because I had a change of heart, but I no longer saw other projects as flops. I sent the scenarios and scripts I reviewed and selected with chiefs to each actor. Then I asked for their opinion.</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon was first.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw that scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon suddenly said as he walked into the meeting room with Chief Lee Bongjoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCity Jungle.\u201d</p><br/><p>I unconsciously flinched.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scenario was fun. So about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon slowly rubbed his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking about investing in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I relaxed my shoulders. My heart belatedly started to race. In that short moment, I had thought about 20 different ways to handle the situation if he said he was interested in the male lead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in appearing on it since I\u2019ve done a lot of serious roles. I\u2019m currently interested in works that I can act with a smile, but I was thinking about investing because the scenario is fun. I heard other actors do this when they see good projects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How much are you thinking of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a lot. Maybe 500 million won?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c500 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excessive amount. You might not even get your money back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen well, I guess I was wrong about the scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>He replied with a light laugh. Chief Lee Bongjoon simply shook his head at the side like he couldn\u2019t deal with him. I decided to talk to SBE Film about Seo Jijoon\u2019s interest in investing and brought the conversation to his next project.</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon\u2019s eyes, which shined at the prospect of investing, dimmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any I really feel like I want to act in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even give the scripts a close look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon glared at him. Seo Jijoon, who feigned ignorance, let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader. I wasn\u2019t able to say this when the Team 2 Leader was around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry and you can tell me\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI worked like a dog until now. I was thinking that maybe I could take longer breaks between projects\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the two people in front of me bulged.</p><br/><p>Before the flustered Chief Lee Bongjoon could open his mouth, Seo Jijoon brightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I think it\u2019ll be good if you go do your mandatory military service while taking a break.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I said that, Seo Jijoon got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I have to go do mandatory service. I\u2019m thinking about going after one more project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd not take a break?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to work like a dog when I can, why would I take a break? Let\u2019s go take a look at those scripts, hyung!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon chuckled as he was dragged out by Seo Jijoon.</p><br/><p>Next was Im Joowon.</p><br/><p>As soon as he entered the meeting room, he took off his shirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, look at this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 At what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you want me to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed to his stomach. His face looked so uncontrollably happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a six pack! I worked so hard at the gym to make this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it does seem like you have one.\u201d</p><br/><p>It also seemed like you don\u2019t.</p><br/><p>When I looked beside him, Chief Sung Uimin was smiling with a Buddha\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the work drawn up by IBC? The one with Bok Seoin as the male lead. He wants to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why that?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t one of the projects we looked favorably on.</p><br/><p>What happened to the scenarios and scripts we gave him and why did he settle on this on?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe obstinately says he wants to do that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gave me a look, asking me to persuade him because he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Im Joowon was still bragging about his flat belly. He was so jealous whenever Yoon Taekyung took his shirt off for a scene during Royal Family. First, I got Im Joowon to put his shirt back on and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem with that role isn\u2019t your body though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, his body was the biggest problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Boyeon is the female lead. I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any chemistry with you two as love interests because you look so young. Rather than showing off your manly side, it might have a negative effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably look like an aunt and nephew.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that bad, to be honest.</p><br/><p>Chief Sung Uimin dragged Im Joowon, who was intently looking at the mirror, off.</p><br/><p>Song Inho was last.</p><br/><p>He came with the independent film director, who was again doing reshoots and additional shoots.</p><br/><p>The bearded directors entered the room like he was entering a tiger\u2019s den.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that is. Last time I came here, Chief Jo Byunghwan said that they wanted to cancel Song Inho\u2019s contract and were willing to pay the fee. I\u2019ve been avoiding him since then. I don\u2019t even come near W&amp;U anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine now, director. Those days have passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho held the director\u2019s arm while smiling.</p><br/><p>Checking my expression, the director cautiously said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere have been people wanting to invest now that Inho\u2019s fame skyrocketed. I would like to shoot scenes we had to skip due to budget restraints, so if you could free up Inho\u2019s schedule a few times\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might become a posthumous work at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director was shocked as though he felt his life was at risk.</p><br/><p>Song Inho spoke as if trying to calm his worries,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke. Hyung, no, the team leader is a bit of a mischievous joker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hyung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUp until that was all a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>I added with a laugh. Only now did the mood relax.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll you need to do is adjust when it overlaps with other schedules. We\u2019re reviewing a few dramas, but as a rookie, there\u2019ll probably be many days where he has to wait day and night on set.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We can definitely\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The concern in the director\u2019s face was washed away. After those two left with faces like they were about to play pattycake, I organized my thoughts in the meeting room. I twirled the pen in my hand.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>This was the second meeting with Well-Made Pictures.</p><br/><p>The general manager, who had been slowly been thinking over this, finally nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe decided to invest in the film\u2019s potential with a small investment. We will invest 20% of your budget. There are many employees who are against this still, so we couldn\u2019t take out a lot of money. Let\u2019s fill the remaining 80% with partial investors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are working hard to gather the funds.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer replied as he relaxed.</p><br/><p>I silently listened to them before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI did think about the matter of investments.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their gazes gathered on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we ask the public to invest through crowdfunding?\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-206\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 206\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-208\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 208\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201517\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

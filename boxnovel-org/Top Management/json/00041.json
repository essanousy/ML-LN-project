Or a divine move? (2)</p><br/><p>TL: emptycube</p><hr/><br/><p>Seo Jijoon. Seo Jijoon might become the lead\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the team 2 leader is opposing it so we don\u2019t know how it will turn out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he was someone I didn\u2019t expect, my mind became more complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. The script. You need to take a look at it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo took out a thick envelope from a desk drawer. I gulped down my saliva as I received it. When I opened it, I saw two scripts printed on A4 papers. They were the first and second episodes of Cat Guardian Ghost.</p><br/><p>After many ups and downs, I finally held the script which had become a big hit in my hands.</p><br/><p>I carried the script and shut myself in a meeting room.</p><br/><p>After reading the two 50-page scripts, I let out the sigh I had been holding in.</p><br/><p>It was fun.</p><br/><p>Not one scene was boring. The lead and support, even the extras, all the characters seemed lifelike. It followed the fantasy romantic comedy genre while mixing in a complex, yet strong composition of characters as well as realistic dialogue.</p><br/><p>I had only read the text, yet it felt like the two episodes were playing in front of my eyes.</p><br/><p>The script deserved its praise as doing all the work as it truly was entertaining.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Then let\u2019s think about the situation again.</p><br/><p>If I thought with the presumption that the lead would change, Seo Jijoon was definitely not a bad card.</p><br/><p>From what I knew, strong candidates for the male lead were actors, Im Joowon and Park Hyemin. When looking at their levels, Seo Jijoon was the best.</p><br/><p>The problem was that using a successful actor didn\u2019t directly lead to success. Then, wouldn\u2019t every drama that cast top actors become a hit?</p><br/><p>The time when the \u2018top actor effect\u2019 worked had passed, now the key was how well they could digest their role.</p><br/><p>How well they brought out the character\u2019s charm.</p><br/><p>They had to have decent acting skills, however, when an actor who could perfectly get into his character and a great script met, it would have an explosive synergistic effect.</p><br/><p>The male lead in Cat Guardian Ghost had the outer appearance of an extreme perfectionist, but he was careful and shy on the inside. Although, in some ways, he may look foolish, that was actually his charm.</p><br/><p>But the Seo Jijoon I knew was an actor who had shown a very consistent image up until now.</p><br/><p>A cold, irritable elitist image.</p><br/><p>Would an actor like that be able to properly digest this character?</p><br/><p>Such a comical role?</p><br/><p>\u2026 Damn, what a headache.</p><br/><p>I thought about it by myself for a while before going up to the PR office on the fifth floor. Of course, I carried coffee in both hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, have some coffee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Familiar faces poked out between the partitions. Team Leader Park grinned as she got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to used to you standing there like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? Although we\u2019re happy since you bring coffee every time you come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it today?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked after drinking a sip of my coffee,</p><br/><p>\u201cDramas like\u2026 Hwarang of Silla<sup>{1}</sup>, The Beast, The Odd Man, Couple\u2019s Obligation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, they were all successful dramas.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf their leading actors had been changed, would they still have been successful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park knit her brows as she thought before opening her mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, although there would be no end to it if we kept going on and on\u2026 in one word, it\u2019s luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey could have failed or become even greater successes. Or else, why would they say casting is a gamble?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if we\u2019re talking the projects Sunwoo said, even if the leading actors changed, wouldn\u2019t they still have been decent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female employee added in while rubbing her chin in a serious manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, those projects had good scripts as their base. The directing was good too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. No matter what we say, the script undoubtedly plays a large role. Unless the changed actor wasn\u2019t terrible at acting or their chemistry with other actors didn\u2019t work out,\u201d</p><br/><p>Added in the male employee.</p><br/><p>Those were my thoughts as well. Just as I was about to open my mouth, Team Leader Park abruptly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cCat Guardian Ghost. It seems you have a ton of worries about that project. We read the script yesterday, and it was fun. It was the most entertaining out of the projects I\u2019ve read recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The synopsis wasn\u2019t very good, but I read the script without noticing time pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brought Next K-Star on your first day, and if this drama\u2019s a hit as well, there really is something up with you, Sunwoo. We\u2019ll need to keep watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park gave a meaningful smile as she prodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, about why you asked if a drama will be okay even if the leading actor had been changed. Is it maybe because Jijoon might go in as the male lead? Because you worry the project will become weird if he joins?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that true? Then who did you think will be the male lead? Kim Yeonsung? Im Joowon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEy, Jijoon is better than them. If they get can get Jijoon, the production side will be completely ecstatic.\u201d</p><br/><p>I briefly licked my lips before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that Seo Jijoon is a great actor. However, the male lead has parts throughout where he acts foolishly. And in reality, Seo Jijoon\u2019s image is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you haven\u2019t seen Jijoon in person yet, have you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park suddenly laughed out loud. Even the two employees shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Jijoon has no reason for wanting to do this drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I were to say this in the perspective of someone who knows the person known as Seo Jijoon well, if he gets cast, I bet this will be a divine move<sup>{2}</sup> for the project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 A divine move?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Management Business Department Team 2.</p><br/><p>A heavy air hung in the office where two people were sitting face to face with each other</p><br/><p>\u201cJijoon, you weren\u2019t like this before. Why are you suddenly so stubborn?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader vigorously scratched his shaggy hair</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already decided to film a movie this year. We only need to pick a scenario. Once you film a movie with cinematic quality, the title \u2018Movie Star\u2019 will be stuck next to your name, and you will be worth much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon said in a calm voice filled with certainty,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scenario team leader gave me. The roles you suggested me saying that they fit me. In reality, I don\u2019t really understand. You know I\u2019m dumb. How can I act when I don\u2019t understand the character?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJijoon, listen to me. That\u2019s\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Cat Guardian Ghost. I think I can do well in that project. It\u2019s fun as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, even if you\u2019re going to do a miniseries, why does it have to be on cable of all places? Huh? So many projects from public TV networks wanted you. You should know as well, no matter how well-made a drama is on cable, there are many that end with a viewership rating of 1 percent. Why are you trying to waste your time? Don\u2019t you know how important this time is for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader, feeling frustrated, thumped his chest as he attempted to persuade him. Seo Jijoon, who had kept his silence until now, suddenly frowned with his sharp eyes before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI did all the projects team leader picked out for me until now. I want to do what I want this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJijoon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jijoon deeply lowered his head.</p><br/><p>After a moment had passed, Seo Jijoon opened the office door and left expressionlessly. His long legs walked in long strides before he let out a small sigh and opened the emergency exit door. Lee Bongjoon, his manager, who had been sitting on the stairs, stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did it go? Did you tell it to him straight?\u201d</p><br/><p>After closing the door, Seo Jijoon slumped down.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, I think so. Ah, damn. I thought I was going to die of suffocation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s lucky you weren\u2019t eaten by the team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I asked you to come with me! How can hyung let your actor go into a snake\u2019s den alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re the actor, you can go in and say it straightforwardly. If I went in there, I\u2019d be fired. Would you like it if I was fired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mumbled Seo Jijoon as he licked his lips. Lee Bongjoon let out a sigh and said with a relieved expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s good that it went well. Even if you\u2019re a bit stubborn, I think it\u2019s good if you do this drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? You think the same, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I knew it the moment I saw it. This is a script meant for you. As well as a role meant for you. I even thought that the writer wrote it with you in mind, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really\u2026 How is it that hyung and I think so similarly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. That\u2019s why I\u2019m your manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two crouched down on the cold emergency stairs and laughed for a while. Then, as if he suddenly thought of something, Lee Bongjoon mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is the case, I should meet with Team 3\u2019s Lucky Charm. Since we might be filming together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky what? Who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know Neptune from our company?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I think I\u2019ve heard of them before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s their manager. They say he\u2019s the one who brought this project here. He asked the PR team for the synopsis and even requested for the script to put one of Neptune\u2019s members in the drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really? Then, if it wasn\u2019t for him, I wouldn\u2019t have seen this script?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon, who thought with narrowed eyes, opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, I want to come with you when you go meet that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Pan Production. CEO Kim Pansuk didn\u2019t move as he stared holes into his cellphone. Production Producer Park Sookyung placed the bowl of jjajangmyeon<sup>{3}</sup> he had completely wiped clean down and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO, your jjajangmyeon is going to get mushy. You should hurry up and eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I can swallow jjajangmyeon right now? In this critical moment when Seo Jijoon is thinking about whether he will do our drama or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like the call will come faster because you\u2019re staring like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Shin Taekyun yawned as he joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people from above are in a frenzy, telling us to quickly bring them Seo Jijoon\u2019s contract. They say they are waiting with articles confirming his casting already written.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026 This is so nerve-wracking. So nerve-wracking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that that guy is good at acting, but will he fit with our project? Senior said you met him briefly yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I felt it that moment. If Director Shin and Writer Hong saw him, you\u2019ll know what I mean. So we need to get him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk held his cellphone as if it was a treasure and slouched over the table.</p><br/><p>Park Sookyung, who had been organizing the dishes, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, CEO. Was it Lee Songha? When should we schedule her audition? We promised to contact them so we need to decide fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 that girl group? The one who\u2019s acting for the first time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. For the role of the interpreter, Jung Haewon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Shin Taekyun, and even Writer Hong Jumi, who had her face in the bowl of jjamppong<sup>{4}</sup>, lifted their heads. CEO Kim Pansuk said in an awkward expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, if she fails the audition, Seo Jijoon won\u2019t join or anything, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like we sent it with Seo Jijoon in mind in the first place. They contacted us because the member known as Lee Songha read the synopsis and wanted to audition for it. They say her manager actively suggested it or something? I don\u2019t even know where he heard about our drama, but they say he was the first one to ask for the synopsis as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen. Contact this grateful manager and ask him if she could audition for an easier role instead of Jung Haewon. Since the role of Jung Haewon will be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough Jung Haewon is a supporting role, she is of great importance. And if they don\u2019t have the acting skills, they will definitely not be able to get into character.\u201d</p><br/><p>Writer Hong Jumi, as well as Director Shin Taekyun, nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk said it again,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we cast a first-timer and if they can\u2019t act, the actor and the project gets criticized. How can we ruin this great script with a miscast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I will call the manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Sookyung picked up his cell phone and got up.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Hwarang is also known as Flowering Knights.

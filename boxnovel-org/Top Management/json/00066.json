I don\u2019t have any plans on watching it. Go back.</p><br/><p>How successful would I have to be to be able to say such refreshing words to a top star?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I saw it. It was really fun. Congratulations on ranking first in ratings amongst the programs airing at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor stood up from his seat and said in greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Neptune\u2019s manager, Choi Gunyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face was so friendly that it made anyone, whether they were young, old, male, or female, have a favorable impression of him. However, it didn\u2019t work on Son Chaeyoung. As soon as she heard he was Neptune\u2019s manager, her eyebrows rose.</p><br/><p>Glancing briefly at the traitor, Son Chaeyoung looked at me and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you? Did you watch it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was too busy yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied nonchalantly. Maybe it was because Son Chaeyoung straightforwardly acted as the \u2018crazy bitch\u2019 in this region, but she was easier to deal with than the traitor. Although they were pretty much the same, my mind was less complicated at the very least.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung, who had been fully prepared to boast, frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You didn\u2019t watch it? Why didn\u2019t you watch it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t watch it because I was busy with my schedule, but if you ask me why I didn\u2019t watch it, then all I can say it I was too busy to watch it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while shrugging, but Son Chaeyoung stomped her sharp heels on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how busy you are, you should have watched it! I watched Cat Guardian Ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>She shouted before quickly adding in as if she had slipped up,</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that basic manners since we work in the same company?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manners? For the word \u2018manners\u2019 to come out from her mouth. It sent shivers down my spine.</p><br/><p>It seemed like she had expected me to react with a \u2018Damn it! For Cat Guardian Ghost to be pushed aside by Mermaid out of Water! For Songha to lose to Son Chaeyoung! I\u2019m angry!\u2019 Well, that wasn\u2019t happening.</p><br/><p>Even if I didn\u2019t know that Mermaid out of Water would flop its tail before it dried up and died, I would never reveal such a reaction in front of Son Chaeyoung. I would rather play Sse Sse Sse<sup>{1}</sup> with the traitor.</p><br/><p>Either way, it was nice she watched Cat Guardian Ghost. Just imagining what her expression was like when she watched it made me feel refreshed as if soda was being poured into my blood vessels.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha, did she see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>A grinding sound escaped her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch it today for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a night shoot today as well so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>That surprised me. The more I saw her, the more I felt the team 3 leader\u2019s words that day were correct. Considering the way she acted, she had to have a mental illness. It looked like Son Chaeyoung was trying to pierce the floor as she stomped the ground with her heels when suddenly, the glass door burst open once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cChaeyoung! Just where did you go, leaving your phone behind?! I looked everywhere for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Chief Jo. Panting heavily, he sighed when he saw me. His face indicated he figured out what was going on with a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to see the CEO. Since his meeting ended just now, let\u2019s quickly go meet him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I saw Chief Jo trying his best to coax her, I suddenly recalled what I thought when I saw him for the first time. I had thought that he was someone who had saved a nation in his past life to have become Son Chaeyoung\u2019s manager, but it was the opposite. Looking at her, there was no doubt he sold out his nation in his previous life.</p><br/><p>It seemed meeting CEO Baek Hansung was more important than hassling me as Son Chaeyoung told me repeatedly to watch the rebroadcasts of her drama and left.</p><br/><p>Of course, I did plan on seeing it. I planned on watching it when it started to go downhill. Since I had also thought Mermaid out of Water was a good drama looking at its synopsis before I saw the future, I thought I could learn something by seeing how a good project would fail.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has a really unique personality.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor grinned. His expression when he looked at me previously was a bit stiff, but it had now returned to its usual state.</p><br/><p>I replied in my usual manner,</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling her personality unique is a huge understatement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, since she started off as a child actor, she pretty much spent the majority of her life in the entertainment business. When thinking of it like that, it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t understand her.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like I can\u2019t understand her?</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, there are lines you shouldn\u2019t cross. You know what Son Chaeyoung and Teacher Shim Kyungtaek did to Songha. You can\u2019t just \u2018understand\u2019 her and gloss over the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, the traitor smiled faintly and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 but, well, this industry makes people like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>This industry makes people like that?</p><br/><p>His words weren\u2019t wrong since this industry was a place where all sorts of things happened. Even I threatened someone right to his face within the first few months of working in this industry. Also, there was no telling if an incident like that wouldn\u2019t occur again.</p><br/><p>However, there was still a line people shouldn\u2019t cross.</p><br/><p>I stared directly at the traitor and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone who works in this industry isn\u2019t like Son Chaeyoung. Someone like her, it might not have been the industry that made her like that but, instead, was someone like that from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>After facing the traitor and Son Chaeyoung at the same time, I was confused whether I was at work or in the abode of demons.</p><br/><p>Just when would this company be purified?</p><br/><p>I was on my way to the office while recalling the number of Mermaid out of Water episodes that have yet to air and the date Neptune\u2019s next album would go on sale.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you made a wrong guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, Team Leader Park was sitting in the lounge. Her face was drained of energy. Now that I thought about it, Kim Hyunjo did say Son Chaeyoung had grilled her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMade a wrong guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked, sitting down in front of her, Team Leader Park looked around, and after confirming no one was around, she said in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said so the first day you met Son Chaeyoung. That you got a bad vibe from Mermaid out of Water. But it seems like it\u2019ll be a big hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>I simply smiled wordlessly.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park patted my shoulder as if comforting me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, still, don\u2019t be disappointed. Your name has definitely spread with just Cat Guardian Ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled the people waiting for me at the PR team\u2019s office last time. I had a hunch that, when Mermaid out of Water flops, the PR team employees would look at me with the same expressions as those people.</p><br/><p>I really had to be careful with my words from now on.</p><br/><p>I was resolving myself when Team Leader Park said with a meaningful look,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only the employees who know you, even celebrities do. Although I can\u2019t say who, there was someone who went to the team 3 leader, telling him he wanted to work with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was someone who wanted to work with me? Who?</p><br/><p>When I looked at her with wide eyes, Team Leader Park smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the team 3 leader thoroughly refused, saying that it was currently an important time for Neptune, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are snatched by someone else, Songha might cause a fuss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was she being serious?</p><br/><p>I scratched my neck while thinking about it. If I got in a situation where I had to change the celebrity I was assigned to, although I currently didn\u2019t want to, how would Lee Songha react?</p><br/><p>She would definitely be sad. She might even try to hold me back. Though, I would be in shock if she just said goodbye.</p><br/><p>However, to cause a fuss in the company.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many cases where celebrities feel the need to possess a monopoly over people and things they consider theirs. Well, I did say that she might cause a fuss as a joke, but seeing how she acts towards you, I feel like that day might actually come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Monopoly?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a word that suited Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>When I tilted my head, Team Leader Park grinned as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cTry bringing it up with Lee Songha later, and see how she reacts.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t hear any news from Kim Hyunjo, who had left with the USB drive in his hands, for a while. I only heard from him while I was waiting at the Cat Guardian Ghost drama shoot.</p><br/><p>Considering how long it took, he didn\u2019t say much. He said he played Lee Taehee\u2019s song for the team 3 leader and that they planned on discussing it with the staff, CEO Baek Hansung, and board members at the next internal meeting.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t worried since I felt it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to push Lee Taehee\u2019s song as one of the double title tracks. The fact that her song was the title track in the original future meant that it had been chosen by those people then as well.</p><br/><p>After I called Lee Taehee, explaining the situation, Chief Lee Bongjoon, who had been sitting right next to me, warming himself in front of the campfire, poked my side. Then he gestured with his chin. When I turned around, Lee Songha was staring at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come out when it\u2019s cold? The shoot of the scene ahead of yours is continuously being delayed, so we have to wait a while longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s outdoor shoot was at a camping ground in a dense forest. Perhaps it was because we were in a forest, but the temperature felt like it kept dropping. We were lucky to have a campfire, if we didn\u2019t even have this, we would freeze.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I gestured to her with my hands, Lee Songha trudged her way towards me before sitting down next to me. Even though the distance from the parked van to here wasn\u2019t far, since her cheeks had paled due to the cold, I handed her the two hot packs I had in my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, put one in each pocket. They are quite warm even though they are small.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her small, white hands held the hot packs. Then, following my words, she put one in each of her pockets. It seemed she was fiddling with them as her pockets squirmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you call Taehee unni just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Her voice didn\u2019t sound well. Well, there\u2019s no way her body would be fine after working for two days without sleep. She\u2019s already so thin, I wonder if she\u2019ll be fine. I guess I should check up on her when I take you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think unni will be asleep by then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was due to the crackling sounds of the fire, but her voice sounded especially quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. She probably will. It\u2019ll be quite late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, it might be past 1 a.m. then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI almost woke up a sleeping girl. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m always with you until early morning, but it looks like I lost my sense of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when I go home and if Taehee unni isn\u2019t sleeping, I\u2019ll ask if she\u2019s okay and call oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You will?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha revealed a small smile as she nodded.</p><br/><p>Not long after, they started filming Lee Songha\u2019s scene. When I saw her acting with Seo Jijoon and other actors, Lee Songha from before had disappeared. The person standing there was Jung Haewon.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably cold since her outfit is so thin. I hope that they finished filming this scene quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Songha almost never makes mistakes. She\u2019ll probably finish quickly and come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon said while shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>That was true. Even when compared to other actors, Lee Songha made considerably fewer mistakes. On top of that, the majority of re-shoots were caused by misalignments in the scene, making Director Shin Taekyun redirect it, or the wind and other sounds muddling the audio.</p><br/><p>While I was watching them film with happy eyes, Chief Lee Bongjoon asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Do you have any of Songha\u2019s snacks left over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of person do you think Songha is? She\u2019s not the type of girl who does something like have snacks left over.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was worried that she wasn\u2019t eating much when she got in the role of Jung Haewon at first, but it seemed she quickly adjusted to it as she would eat a ton before filming and a ton afterwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, I need to start carrying food around with me too. I\u2019m already cold and sleepy; I can\u2019t handle this if I\u2019m hungry as well. Winter film shoots overexert your body. You should be careful while you\u2019re still young. You\u2019re going to be seriously sick once we finish filming a drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you recruit a road manager and split the work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaa, although I would very much to do that, I can\u2019t because of Jijoon, that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon grumbled while looking at Seo Jijoon who was currently acting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t stand the sight of me resting. If he doesn\u2019t see me for a moment, he\u2019ll ask where I am, what I\u2019m doing, and where I went while leaving him behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m living with someone with delusional jealousy than a celebrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, it did seem Seo Jijoon did follow Chief Lee Bongjoon very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is also a problem itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t seem like this is a problem wholly unrelated to you either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about Songha. It seems like she\u2019ll cause a fuss if you ever leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said similar words as Team Leader Park.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Team Leader Park did say something like that previously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Park did?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know if the person is an actor or a singer, but either way, someone went to the team 3 leader and said he wanted to work with me. Team Leader Park did tell me to bring it up with Songha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was in the middle of talking when Chief Lee Bongjoon poked my side like before. Then he gestured with his chin.</p><br/><p>When I turned around, Lee Songha was standing rigidly a few steps away.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1} </sup>Similar to Patty Cake</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-65\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 65\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-67\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 67\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201245\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

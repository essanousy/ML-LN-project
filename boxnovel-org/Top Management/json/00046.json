I swept my ruffled hair and let out the sigh I had been holding back for the past hour.</p><br/><p>Then I refreshed the browser.</p><ul><li>Oh, it\u2019s finally Neptune\u2019s turn lol Waiting for a more laughable performance than Sugar Cats haha</li><li>Today\u2019s highlight haha</li><li>omg?</li><li>omg</li><li>What the heck hahahaha</li><li>They\u2019re amazing. From my perspective, their skill dominates other girl groups.</li><li>The producer edited it this way to catch us off guard from the start hahaha No wonder, it seemed they were focusing on them too hard.</li><li>They have the most eye-catching visuals and carried the performances. They benefited the most this episode.</li><li>Anyone know the name of the straight-haired girl constantly getting close-ups? She\u2019s extremely pretty</li><li>Where did all those people commenting about why they were cast when they have no skill go? They were swearing a moment ago, but they\u2019re quiet now lol</li><li>I\u2019m really curious, but why haven\u2019t they been known until now? Was their company bad?</li><li>Their company is W&amp;U. There isn\u2019t always a reason for not becoming popular. There are some who can\u2019t get popular no matter what they do.</li><li>Neptune\u2019s skill has been revealed Won\u2019t they suddenly get popular though this?</li><li>We\u2019ll have to see about that. If the program fails, then it\u2019s all for nothing.</li><li>There are already two pages about K-Star. Although we\u2019ll have to see tomorrow, isn\u2019t already a success in term of becoming a hot topic considering this is their first broadcast?</li></ul><br/><p>It was as Kim Hyunjo said. Reporter Park Woojeong\u2019s words were correct as well.</p><br/><p>Next K-Star\u2019s first broadcast was, with Neptune as its focus, a drama with a twist.</p><br/><p>The living room became filled with wild excitement and tension.</p><br/><p>The judges\u2019 compliments continued one after another after their performance. The edit was still on Neptune\u2019s side. Cuts of the judges\u2019 admiring reactions, and cuts of them murmuring to each other. Then the broadcast showed the insert they filmed at the company practice room and repeatedly instilled how surprised people were at Neptune\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>Just as they were called the best team, the background music cut off and the mood changed.</p><br/><p>Criticisms poured out solely on Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u2018You alone lowered the team\u2019s average. Are you practicing properly?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Since you\u2019re so eye-catching, my vision keeps going to you, but when I look at you, there isn\u2019t anything beyond that. It would make more sense if you had a record in acting or entertainment, but that\u2019s not the case either.\u2019</p><br/><p>They caught a close-up of Lee Songha\u2019s reaction. She was unable to fully hide her expectant expression, and her expression fell slightly as she looked at the judges. However, it was only for a moment. With a serene expression, void of any expectation or excitement, she lowered her head.</p><br/><p>The next moment was followed by the interview with Lee Songha after the performance.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will try harder from now on.\u2019</p><br/><p>I immediately checked the reactions on the internet.</p><ul><li>Lee Songha is being unnecessarily criticized by the judges. Am I the only one who felt she was good?</li><li>To be honest, she did do worse than her other members.</li><li>It\u2019s that her members were too good, I don\u2019t think she didn\u2019t so badly to be criticized that much. If she was in Sugar Cats and not Neptune, then she would have been complimented.</li><li>She\u2019s above average if we consider the girl groups overall.</li><li>She\u2019s completely dominating other girl groups with her looks alone, isn\u2019t that enough? Since she\u2019s still new, she can get better if she tries harder.</li><li>If she was in Sugar Cats and not Neptune, she would have been complimented</li><li>I thought she\u2019d cry like other girls, but she so calm. She has an iron mentality.</li></ul><br/><p>Although she was criticized, since they didn\u2019t play any tricks with editing, the overall public opinion of Lee Songha was good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reactions from the forums are good. How is it on social media?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good here as well. The internet is much tamer than I expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor took his hands off his keyboard as he replied. Next to him, Kim Hyunjo was in a trance as he focused on his screen. Seeing as how he was constantly muttering, \u201cOkay, good,\u201d it seemed that it was okay to relax a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, what are people saying? Are we okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they saying anything about Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the girls were looking in our direction. When I turned to glance at the traitor, our eyes met. Then we smiled simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the reactions are good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung snatched the traitor\u2019s laptop away like an alley cat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s look at it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ immediately sat next to her. Lee Songha, who had been eating the chicken cleanly to its bones, slowly stuck her head out as well. Although Lee Taehee didn\u2019t join them, she was leisurely searching it herself on her phone.</p><br/><p>After 30 seconds, the living room changed into a festive mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this. This is no joke. There are so many people who know our names!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey know because our names kept showing up in the captions, you dummy. Hurry up and go to the next page.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone said he became my fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unfortunate. Hey, I told you to go to the next page.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah, what do I do? My name\u2019s on a title, but I don\u2019t think I can click it! Songha, can you do it for me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn, this is so frustrating! Give it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have your phone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I have my phone. Right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung, who couldn\u2019t keep still, kept going around the living room while holding the laptop, and LJ kept spinning in place as she looked at her phone.</p><br/><p>Since Lee Taehee was lying on the sofa like usual, I thought that she was calm. As expected of the leader. However, when I looked closer, she had one hand on her phone and other on a glass of wild ginseng wine. Just how many glasses did she have so far?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was sitting in a corner, tapping her phone. My laptop happened to have comments about her so I handed it over to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She readily received it and focused her gaze on the screen, only her eyes moved hurriedly. She blinked a few times as if she was surprised that people were complimenting her singing and dancing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, really. Producer Go Joontae, this man\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, Kim Hyunjo put down his laptop and grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was going to be like this, he should have let us know in advance\u2026 I unnecessarily swore a ton at him. Gunyoung, you know all the staff\u2019s numbers, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor, who had been in the middle of stretching, replied right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cText Producer Go Joontae that today\u2019s broadcast was good and thank him for editing it well. Also, send a gifticon to each staff member. Something like coffee. Also, tell him that we\u2019ll visit the editing room with some snacks some day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll pick out some good ones and send them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I was so tense that my joints are aching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo groaned as he slouched on the sofa.</p><br/><p>I checked the messages on my still-vibrating phone. I received long messages from my brother and his wife, and I also saw some messages from people I hadn\u2019t talked to for a while.</p><br/><p>How did they know when I only told my family and my friends on the group chat about the broadcast?</p><br/><p>When I checked, it seemed that I was caught on camera next to Neptune for some time after they came down from the stage.</p><br/><p>When I opened the group chat with my friends, messages popped up one after another.</p><ul><li>You told us to think you went back to mandatory military service. Is that the army, you bastard?</li><li>Just wait until I see you, man, you\u2019re screwed. Did you forget about your friends while you were playing in heaven?</li><li>Let me know anytime you need a part timer. I\u2019m ready to skip my lectures.</li></ul><br/><p>Below that were endless messages asking for a video call and asking for a date so I set my phone to mute without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>As I opened my contacts to call my mom first-</p><br/><p>\u201cUh? They are talking about us again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung pointed to the TV. Everyone turned their gazes back towards it.</p><br/><p>The judges\u2019 personal interviews commenced after the mission performances and evaluations.</p><br/><p>Producer Song Baekjin rubbed his patchy chin and said in a regretful tone,</p><br/><p>\u2018I said it during the shoot, but if Lee Songha did some acting\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That girl actually got cast in a drama two days after our recording.\u2019</p><br/><p>We heard Producer Go Joontae\u2019s voice, and Song Baekjin widened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh? Really? Wow, she acts fast. If that\u2019s the case, my evaluation changes. If she shows above average acting skills there, then it\u2019ll be a win-win for her and her team.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then the scene changed. Two days after their first recording. It explained that Lee Songha auditioned and joined TVL\u2019s new miniseries Cat Guardian Ghost, and how she successfully took her first step towards becoming an acting idol.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood inside the living room froze.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a problem with letting others know Lee Songha was cast for the drama if they were simply mentioning it as Knet and TVL were both subsidiaries.</p><br/><p>The problem was the nuance.</p><br/><p>The way they put it made it look as though Lee Songha took her chance at acting without any preparations because she received criticisms that she lacked in both dancing and singing during the recording. Auditioned and cast within two days. On top of that, if people thought about how the male lead, Seo Jijoon, was also from the same company, this was the same as dropping a bomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, how could\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo stuttered as he looked at the TV with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do if they reveal it like that? Seriously, this man\u2026 We were already putting our heads together to figure out the best time to announce it without any misunderstandings\u2026 Ah, what a headache. Ah, I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right then, Kim Hyunjo\u2019s phone rang. Kim Hyunjo picked up his phone with a face that seemed to have aged 10 years in these past few moments before turning his head towards the traitor.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you send the gifticons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t send them. Fuck the gifticons\u2026 Team Leader Park? We just saw it as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo disappeared into the kitchen to talk with Team Leader Park.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, pass me the laptop.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the laptop away from Lee Songh since the comments wouldn\u2019t be so lenient to her now.</p><br/><p>As if the traitor had the same thoughts, he took back the laptop from Im Seoyoung and requested the other girls stop searching as well.</p><br/><p>I refreshed the forum and glanced through the reactions.</p><ul><li>They say Neptune\u2019s Lee Songha was cast in a drama.</li><li>omg? When I looked at the article, it said the male lead was Seo Jijoon. Both are from W&amp;U. No doubt she was just added in.</li><li>Are you dyslexic? Read the article again. It says she was cast after auditioning for it properly.</li><li>Now really, who\u2019s going to believe that? Lol That\u2019s just their company\u2019s manipulation lol</li><li>They say it\u2019s her first time in a drama, yet it\u2019s not a web series but a miniseries. Chosen as a supporting role and not a minor one. In a drama where Seo Jijoon is the male lead to boot. It\u2019s obvious just looking at it.</li><li>Then what about other idols who were cast in supporting roles in public networks? If you want to bash her, then you need to bash others like Im Sooyeon and Jang Inbum.</li><li>They were bashed a ton at first. Now they\u2019ve been recognized for their acting ability. Also, they were cast by producers for their newsworthiness+overseas publications as they were already popular. Does Lee Songha have that merit? When no one has heard or seen her before?</li><li>Their company added her in no matter how you look at it. You shouldn\u2019t be so protective. Lol</li><li>Bash her after you see her act. You guys made a fuss saying that Neptune had no skill and that they joined Next K-Star because of their company then disappeared after seeing their performance, and now you\u2019re starting it again. Don\u2019t you have other things to do?</li><li>She really could have been cast after an audition. I see people who all fidgety in hopes of bashing her already.</li><li>If Lee Songha is good at acting, then these accusations will disappear.</li><li>If she was good at acting, then she would have already done it. Neptune was unknown for two years.</li><li>Bash her after you see her act</li><li>Looking at these people protecting her, it looks like Neptune really did well today.</li><li>If she was good at acting, then she would have done it already.</li><li>Either way, this was successful in becoming a hot topic. There are tons of articles too. The staff of Next K-Star and Cat Guardian Ghost are probably dancing right now.</li></ul><br/><p>When I looked up, Lee Songha was looking at me. Although she appeared calm, I now knew enough to know that she wasn\u2019t fine inside. I closed the laptop and, as if it was no big deal, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-45\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 45\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-47\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 47\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201204\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

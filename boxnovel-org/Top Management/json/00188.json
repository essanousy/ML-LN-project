A suit and tie were too aggressive while a t-shirt would be too lax. Taking the middle ground, I wore slacks and a blue dress shirt and went outside.</p><br/><p>It was ten minutes before eleven.</p><br/><p>After checking my watch, I opened Neptune\u2019s door and entered.</p><br/><p>The entrance was empty. I heard Lee Songha\u2019s voice coming from the kitchen, rather than her usual \u2018Welcome\u2019 at the entrance. All I saw in the living room was a fruit basket that was so big it was burdensome. Im Seoyoung, LJ, and Lee Taehee were all gathered in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>I was wondering what they were preoccupied with for them to not even notice someone come in and found that they had a guest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are there so many Western spices in this tiny fridge? Do you really cook that often?\u201d</p><br/><p>A middle-aged woman asked with her head in the fridge.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung gathered her hands in a polite manner and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, those spices are from LJ\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Oh my, and you have a variety of kimchi? Do you buy them from the store?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, my mom sent us those not too long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Is that so? Then are all these side dishes from your mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose were from Taehee unni\u2019s family. There are some Sunwoo oppa brought as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman, Lee Songha\u2019s mother, closed the fridge. An awkward flashed on her face, which wasn\u2019t very similar to Lee Songha\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other mothers are working hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, you\u2019ve come early.\u201d</p><br/><p>I went over and greeted her. Lee Songha, who had been sitting at the table, jolted up. The girls, who looked like their living habits were being examined, suddenly brightened. At the same time, Lee Songha\u2019s mother brushed her short hair over her ear and smiled at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, our Chief Jung has been getting more and more handsome. I heard that you\u2019re getting another promotion? Your parents must be full without eating when they have a son who\u2019s so good at working and is famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then you must be full forever with a daughter like Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, is that how it is? It\u2019s still surreal to me that she\u2019s a celebrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her tone was wrapped in refinement. Her hair was tidy with no stray strands as though she had just been to a hair salon. Her pearl earrings the size of a thumb caught my attention. She wore an elegant two-piece outfit without a single wrinkle. She truly looked like she was ready for battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to check up on her more frequently, but I was so busy. I was busy sending my second daughter to study overseas last year. The year before that, I was busy with my fourth\u2019s college admission. And this year, my first graduated Hyemun Women\u2019s University. I was so busy with her job search\u2026\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha cut her off.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to my room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child, I\u2019m talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnnis are busy since they have to get ready for their schedules. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was chilly. However, Lee Songha\u2019s mother acted like she didn\u2019t notice anything as she said goodbye to each member before finally going in Lee Songha\u2019s room. The girls let out a sigh and flopped on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung grabbed my shirt sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, what is this all of a sudden? What did she come here to say? Is something going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? She just came to see Songha. Your parents come often too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls narrowed their eyes as if telling me not to lie. The girls particularly had difficulty with Lee Songha\u2019s mother even though they didn\u2019t know that she brought up having Lee Songha quit Neptune in the past.</p><br/><p>With their gazes behind me, I prepared three glasses of ginger tea and went to Lee Songha\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>The mother and daughter were talking as they sat on the rug below the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have told me if the other mothers sent over side dishes and kimchi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I knew, I would have sent something too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be exact, it was Lee Songha\u2019s mother who was talking while Lee Songha wasn\u2019t really paying attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so indifferent? Just because I was preoccupied doesn\u2019t mean you should be freeloading. People must have thought ill of me, thinking I don\u2019t care about you after sending you off. What do the other girls like? Should I make braised short-ribs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019s fine. We usually eat out. We can\u2019t finish what we already have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you throw it out, I should at least do something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha let out a laugh that was like a sigh. She glanced at me before her gaze dropped to the floor.</p><br/><p>I placed the tray down between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease have some tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, thank you. Chief Jung, you\u2019re living by yourself too, right? Should I send you some braised short-ribs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve eaten at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to get married. Aren\u2019t there any good women around you? Wait. I have four daughters at home, and I think there\u2019s only a four-year difference between you and my first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s five years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha put her cup down. Her expression was chilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you came to talk about me, talk about me. Stop bringing up my sisters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. You still act like a child at twenty-two.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at them while rubbing my teacup. I had seen the girls\u2019 family countless times during my two years managing Neptune, but Lee Songha\u2019s family was particularly complicated. They weren\u2019t the normally intense type and looking from a distance, they looked like a peaceful family.</p><br/><p>However, you could sense disharmony with every step you approached.</p><br/><p>Before Lee Songha could become even chillier, I went to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you had something you wanted to speak to me about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, about Songha\u2019s next project. Has it been decided?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was fine.</p><br/><p>As a parent leaving their child in someone else\u2019s care, it was normal for them to be curious about their future plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are constantly looking over it. There are just so many projects. We need to pay special care to select one that is most suitable for Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that it\u2019s not good for them to take too long of a break.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for celebrities who take one or two-year breaks. It hasn\u2019t been that long since Royal Family ended, and the character, Lee Sohee, is still well-received. There\u2019s no need to hastily pick a project. Rather, viewers might mix her characters if she does another project too quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s mother nodded seriously as she listened to me. Lee Songha propped her chin on her arm, which was on her knee, as she observed her mother. Soon, Lee Songha\u2019s mother cautious said,</p><br/><p>\u201cCould I see some of the proposals or scenarios that came in?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was fine too.</p><br/><p>To be honest, there were many parents who looked over their child\u2019s projects beforehand. There were many cases where an actress\u2019s family opposed a project because there were too many revealing scenes. Although they didn\u2019t give professional advice, there were many cases where their family\u2019s support gave the celebrity confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you suddenly want to look at them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha abruptly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all of a sudden. I wanted to see them before. I was worried that people might think I was getting overly involved if I asked. But I heard that other actors\u2019 mothers also look through scenarios. Some even discuss with managers before they pick a project. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When an actor was a rookie or unknown, the company held more sway. Many actors and their families tended to wholeheartedly accept the company\u2019s decision as well.</p><br/><p>However, the voices of top actors held more sway when picking a project. While a lot did leave the decision to their managers, many also one-sidedly decided on a project as well. During this process, their families also tended to have more influence on their decision.</p><br/><p>Then a conflict could break out between the manager and the actor\u2019s family.</p><br/><p>If one side was dumb or crazy, then it would break out into a fight.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 There are cases like that. It is also common to trust the company and leave the decision to them. Still, I hope that you could trust my decision. I am a little worried since there have been cases where people quarrel over the decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said with a smile. I was very accustomed to putting on an innocent air by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t trust you to make a good decision!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s mother quickly waved her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would trust you if you said you could make fermented soybeans from red beans. All the projects you selected for Songha until now were great successes. Also, I won\u2019t do something like one-sidedly pushing for my pick and ignoring yours. That would be foolish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust, as her mother, I was wondering how much choice she has\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2019s opinion is top priority. They said that too many cooks spoil the broth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha cut her off.</p><br/><p>Her mother leered at her with an embarrassed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that too. Do you think I\u2019m not thinking of what\u2019s best for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She then looked back at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I simply feel like I haven\u2019t paid enough attention to her. I heard that there are mothers who go to shoots and greet the directors. I feel like that\u2019s too extreme. Would looking at the projects be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was fine.</p><br/><p>But if she was doing this because the Team 2 Leader incited her to, then it wasn\u2019t fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve spoken a lot with our Team 2 Leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s mother waved her hand, seemingly taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who called to ask him questions. He called to ask how we were doing, and after a few greetings, our conversation grew longer. He also answered a lot of my questions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have questions, ask me. Don\u2019t ask some random person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha frowned.</p><br/><p>Her mother made an even more embarrassed expression as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is a team leader at your company some random person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just being a little cautious.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while acting like we were in a predicament.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we are in the same company, we are in different teams. Because they also have actresses, there\u2019s also a sense of competition between our teams. It\u2019s best for people as successful as Songha and her parents to be cautious. A simple exchange could end up as a malicious rumor. Rumors regarding a celebrity\u2019s family tend to last longer as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s mother\u2019s expression changed drastically. She was so nervous that she couldn\u2019t sit still and was busy recalling her conversation with the Team 2 Leader to make sure she didn\u2019t slip up. My eyes momentarily met Lee Songha\u2019s before I drank the slightly cooled ginger tea.</p><br/><p>Anyways, there was no doubt that a rock was thrown into the calm lake.</p><br/><p>I began to make plans within my cold mind.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Team 2 Leader\u2019s inside, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yes. He is. He\u2019s in the middle of a call so-\u201c</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader, who was in the middle of a call like the employee said, was surprised when he saw me. I looked around the office before sitting down on the sofa across from him. The Team 2 Leader frowned. I waved, gesturing him to continue his call, before looking at the stuff laid out on the table.</p><br/><p>It was full of screening tickets, pamphlets, and posters for VIPs.</p><br/><p>\u2018Love Again\u2019</p><br/><p>It was Song Inho\u2019s debut movie that I had seen last night.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, an unwelcome guest has arrived. Hope you can help us out with the magazine review.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he called me an unwelcome guest, his eyes brightened like he was seeing Santa Claus. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was because he thought he had effectively screwed me over or if it was because Song Inho\u2019s debut movie was well-received. His smile hung on his ears.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader quickly hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, you just barge in without knocking now? Do you not have any manners?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you called Songha\u2019s mother. That too isn\u2019t really good manners either.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while picking up a poster and looking at Song Inho\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>I heard him chuckle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that Inho\u2019s debut movie has been released, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what he was thinking, but his smile thickened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou acted like you didn\u2019t care, but it seemed it did bother you? To watch it as soon as it was out. Did the PR Team get tickets for you? If you told me, I could have given you good seats.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took his feet off his desk and approached me.</p><br/><p>Then he sat next to me and grabbed a VIP ticket.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just happened to have some tickets remaining and was gifting them to our actors\u2019 families. This was why I called Songha\u2019s mother. Isn\u2019t this what family should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, family?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was something like this, you should have given them to me. Why did you personally call her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy these days. I just called her as I was calling others.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I acted like I was upset, the Team 2 Leader\u2019s voice became even brighter.</p><br/><p>He crossed his legs and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know that Lee Songha\u2019s oldest sister graduated from Hyemun University? Her second oldest sister is a promising art student, and her younger sister might even become a national athlete. All her children excelled in their prospective fields. Though I don\u2019t know their personalities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you bringing in Songha\u2019s family just to try to screw me over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? All I did was give them a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader shrugged. He was obviously looking down on me.</p><br/><p>He looked confident that a rookie like me wouldn\u2019t be his match no matter how hard I worked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you upset?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen would I be happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop bothering me and my celebrities and focus on your work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe I clearly explained the matter with Mr. Seo Jijoon. I understand why your nickname is \u2018Mother-in-Law\u2019. It feels like I\u2019m being pestered by my mother-in-law even though I\u2019m not married.<sup>{2}</sup>\u201d</p><br/><p>His cheek wriggled. He shot his sinister gaze at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done something you need to explain from the start. This industry is sensitive to stuff like that. It\u2019s common for people to try to backstab you. So use this chance to learn. Well, if you really are upset, you can go complain to the CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said with a smirk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything to complain about. I\u2019m telling you this in case you\u2019re mistaken from only seeing the CEO\u2019s calm demeanor, but the CEO isn\u2019t the type to act on such small complaints.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on complaining. I also know a little about CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s methods.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew that he was the type of person would reward you appropriately if you did your job.</p><br/><p>Also, I knew that he was the type to keep the promises he made.</p><br/><p>I got up and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Song Inho\u2019s movie, I hope it does well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you being sincere?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader snorted. I picked up one of Song Inho\u2019s movie pamphlets.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we all family here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office and went up to the lounge. Among the people there, I approached Blackout\u2019s chief, who had previously handed me a manager\u2019s business card.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, did you eat something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour dark circles are all gone? You look better too. Did the Team 3 Leader get you something nice? Carp? Loaches?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A snake, I guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Blackout\u2019s chief retreated in panic. Smiling, I entered the office. Then I said to Kim Hyunjo, who had his head on his desk,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I\u2019ll be out this afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Do you have a meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to meet Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo\u2019s expression became lukewarm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you give up on Son Chaeyoung\u2019s next project? Weren\u2019t you planning on just acting like you were working on it since it was the CEO\u2019s request?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was why I didn\u2019t actively meet her after being told to screw off last time.</p><br/><p>Although I was tempted by CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s proposal, I didn\u2019t want to earn by hanging onto Son Chaeyoung of all people. I had thought that I could make my team with my own hands even if it took a little longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy thoughts have changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>I really needed that reward now.</p><br/><p>I folded Song Inho\u2019s pamphlet and put in my pocket before turning around.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s try a method suitable for me this time.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Helicopter parents are quite common in Korea.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> The whole \u2018mother-in-law\u2019 trope usually involves a mean mother-in-law and her son\u2019s wife.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-187\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 187\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-189\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 189\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201490\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

A few chiefs from Team 2 were sitting on benches in the garden. The mood was gloomy. Cigarette butts propped up in the ash was like a public cemetery.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee panted as he sat amongst them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck? I thought our meeting was at 10? Why are you all here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeking refuge. The team leader and Son Chaeyoung are fighting again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the number of lit cigarettes increased by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can they cause such a fuss every day this week? Aren\u2019t they tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess we won\u2019t have a meeting today? The team leader will probably be fierce.\u201d</p><br/><p>They let out sighs thicker than the cigarette smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that those rumors are true these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRumors? What rumors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat the Management Department is going to expand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Multiple pairs of eyes quickly shifted in a calculating manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that. Is the rumor trustworthy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI talked to Chief Min in Team 1, and he said that they\u2019ll likely stop operations in the US and return here. I think that the rumors that the Management Department in expanding and that a new team will be created are correct. The important part is who will be the team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chiefs with more years of experience coughed. The only one among them who didn\u2019t seem interested in being a team leader was Chief Lee Bongjoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBongjoon, are you not interested?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, nope. 24 hours isn\u2019t enough to manage Jijoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon waved his hand.</p><br/><p>Just then, Chief Lee Janghyun cautiously joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Jung Sunwoo\u2019s been selected? What\u2019s going on with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you going spread nonsense? If the team leader hears about this, then it\u2019s this.\u201d</p><br/><p>A different chief swept his finger across his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense. There are so many seniors above him. It\u2019s too early for him to lead a team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already leading one. The temporary team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon coolly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like this industry promotes people by their years of experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to work if the higher-ups tell you to work under Jung Sunwoo\u2019s new team? Just think about sucking up to him and calling him team leader. My internal organs are going to curl up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already called him director once and my organs were fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon chuckled for a good as his round shoulders moved up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m transferred, I wish he\u2019d give me frequent vacations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam 2 will probably never let go of Jijoon. Maybe Joowon and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man, whose narrow eyes curved like a fox\u2019s, said with a smile.</p><br/><p>He was Sung Uimin, Im Joowon\u2019s manager.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung played a big role in Joowon signing an exclusive contract with W&amp;U.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, is that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven now, if I bring up his next project, he tells me to show it to Chief Jung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same for Jijoon. Uh, but if it\u2019s like this, it\u2019ll be the same members as last time. The ones who went to China together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other chiefs were astonished as they watched these two chat.</p><br/><p>Just then, a chief who also went to China with them mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung was there too, so you guys can take her with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice mixed with interest continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a rumor that Son Chaeyoung is close with Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat rumor really lasts long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rumor? Son Chaeyoung did a cameo appearance on Royal Family though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she suddenly changed her mind, Chief Jo said they aren\u2019t close. It\u2019s nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Chief Lee Bongjoon and Chief Sung Uimin\u2019s expressions turned strange.</p><br/><p>A few laughed,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. No one\u2019s close to Son Chaeyoung. Who would stick next to her? Even Chief Jo, who has been working with her for years, is like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo needs to manage Son Chaeyoung too. He\u2019ll give up and quit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, he is someone who\u2019s only walked the easy path. Do you think he\u2019ll be able to handle someone as troublesome as Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>That moment, the door of the smoking area opened. The chatting Team 2 chiefs flinched.</p><br/><p>The first person they saw was Kim Hyunjo, who had a smaller stature.</p><br/><p>Behind him was Jung Sunwoo, who was a head taller than him.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>So they were talking about me.</p><br/><p>I scanned their faces while drinking coffee from the vending machine. Their gazes, which were fixed on me, scattered like flies. Only two remained. Chief Lee Bongjoon and Chief Sung Uimin. While I greeted those two, Kim Hyunjo acted familiar with people who had even more experience than him.</p><br/><p>Someone with no sense brought over two empty chairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaekeun keeps going to clubs, so I\u2019m worried he\u2019s going to cause trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClubs are better than hostess bars. That\u2019ll wreck his image.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese days, it\u2019s easier on the mind if celebrities meet each other. They\u2019ll both be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be great if that\u2019s all. Choi Yoojung said she doesn\u2019t have enough money for a building she wants to buy, so she pleaded her manager to go to a wealthy Chinese man\u2019s birthday party. Apparently, he was going to pay her in cash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing her actions, she probably won\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the mood was awkward, the conversation continued smoothly due to the number of people present. They talked about things that reporters would rush to learn about. I took a step back from the conversation and asked how Seo Jijoon and Im Joowon were doing until someone said something to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, do you have any stories to share?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was his name Lee Janghyun?</p><br/><p>I saw him walking around with Chief Jo a couple times.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw you partying in the lounge. Neptune and Pretty Girls seemed quite close. They are also nice to the staff. I think everyone you manage is nice and polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true. Neptune, Nam Joyoon, and Pretty Girls didn\u2019t cause anything overly troublesome.</p><br/><p>Thinking about recent incidents, all I could think of was Lee Songha not eating all her rice, Nam Joyoon eating rice that had gone bad, and Im Seoyoung and LJ ripping a doll while they were fighting. Just things like that.</p><br/><p>Since others would mock about how that could possibly be any trouble, so it really was peaceful.</p><br/><p>I smiled because I was suddenly happy when Chief Lee Janghyun asked again,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, you managed Neptune since you became a road manager, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNam Joyoon and Pretty Girls on top of that. You really had it easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems like he doesn\u2019t like me very much.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t anything new. It was like the penalty for being famous. There were more people who looked at me like that after Making Film began to air, especially managers in the same industry as me. I was worried that someone really might push me down the stairs at this rate.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun glanced at me.</p><br/><p>He looked displeased and wronged. Did I block his path?</p><br/><p>With a laugh, other Team 2 chiefs added,</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to our day, Neptune is so easy to handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe stress from them acting is more taxing than being physically exhausted from a busy schedule. I\u2019ll be happy to faint from exhaustion if I get to work with someone like Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to really experience those that act out. That\u2019s how you gain experience and learn the tricks of the trade. Who would fear after handling Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever meet someone as difficult as Son Chaeyoung in my career.\u201d</p><br/><p>People sighed around me. Kim Hyunjo was frowning. I didn\u2019t know if it was because he usually looked gloomy or because they were ignoring him, but a few Team 2 chiefs continued to laugh and chat.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo tilted his head and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t considered work, then what is it? Do we just play around all day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what we mean. We\u2019re just thinking that Chief Jung should also step on the thorny path to learn more. This industry has more thorny paths than flowery ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo nosy. We\u2019ll handle ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo coldly replied before I could even frown.</p><br/><p>The chief from Team 2 waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. We\u2019re just saying this because of that rumor about a \u2018team\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rumor?</p><br/><p>I did hear that a rumor about a new team and team leader was going around.</p><br/><p>Was that why their gazes were so unpleasant towards me?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is just nonsense\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 chief trailed off. A phone vibrated and rang.</p><br/><p>It was mine. I grabbed the phone from the table, but Kim Hyunjo became surprised when he saw who was calling. A few of the chiefs on the other side had wide eyes as well.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me it was Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>No, they wouldn\u2019t know it was her since I saved her as the \u2018crazy bitch in this area\u2019.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, I looked at my screen.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Baek Hansung.\u2019</p><br/><p>I almost dropped my phone in the pile of ashes.</p><br/><p>What the heck? Why did this man call me directly again?</p><br/><p>The phone had been ringing for a while now. I quickly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I\u2019m going to go answer the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, go, go. Quickly go and answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo quickly waved his hand. I excused myself with a nod to the other chiefs and turned around. A few of their gazes lingered on me. Their gazes dropped once I turned the corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Mmm, I would like to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy talk you mean\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pretty Girls? Or the new team? If not that, Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>I really hoped it wasn\u2019t the last one.</p><br/><p>-Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>It was just the CEO and me in a high-end restaurant.</p><br/><p>That seemed like a good thing. However, sitting here, I couldn\u2019t even tell if the meat was going down my throat or in my ears.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung was leisurely eating his food. Seeing as he brought me to a restaurant that needed prior reservations and bought me expensive food, it seemed like he was trying to pass Son Chaeyoung over to me.</p><br/><p>I was planning on refusing even if Son Chaeyoung didn\u2019t tell me to.</p><br/><p>The problem was how to best refuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Best my ass.</p><br/><p>I put down my chopsticks and drank some water. He asked for my reason, so I told him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the incident with Lee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that. I also don\u2019t want to work with her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be a swan, but I am working to become a pigeon at least.<sup>{1}</sup> If I work with Ms. Son Chaeyoung, I think I\u2019ll end up as a crow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you think about your team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cNot the project team, but an official one. I think you must have already thought about the employees, artists, and actors you want to bring into your team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I did.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry to get Chaeyoung to decide on her next project. Then I\u2019ll let you have that.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Director Seo Byunghoe\u2019s new project! First, first, take a look at the project proposal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung!\u201d</p><br/><p>A red hand slammed the table. This was the third time already. The two teacups, which had managed to hold on until now, finally toppled over. Son Chaeyoung was sitting with her legs crossed on the other side. Unlike the Team 2 Leader, who seemed like he was about to explode at any moment, Son Chaeyoung was calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe writer wrote it thinking about Yoon Jungah, but if you want it, we can bring it over right away. Chaeyoung, you liked Director Seo\u2019s direction!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project proposal dropped from Son Chaeyoung\u2019s hand. The papers became soaked with tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust why are you acting like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader kicked off the sofa. He clenched his fist multiple times.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because of Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you bringing him up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wanted him as your manager last time. Are you acting like this because you think the CEO will hand him over to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s lips tilted crookedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I? It was so long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s not it, then why? Huh? How long are you going to act like this? What have I not done for you? I did everything you wanted, yet why are you tormenting me like this? Say something other than just that you don\u2019t want to. What else do you want from m\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung cut him off and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m acting like this to torment you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fighting with the CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung got up from the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a casualty in the fight between the CEO and me. So if you want to stop this useless war of attrition, then go tell the CEO that you can\u2019t do it. That you can\u2019t persuade me. That you give up. Tell him that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her sharp voice, which was akin to gnawing on broken shards of porcelain, added,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter who comes to persuade me, I won\u2019t do my next project with this company.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Raws state \u2018White Heron\u2019, I think \u2018Swan\u2019 fits better here.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-174\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 174\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-176\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 176\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201463\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

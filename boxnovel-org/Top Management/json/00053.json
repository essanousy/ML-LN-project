Lee Songha\u2019s expression still seemed to be of Jung Haewon, but she bowed out of habit and returned their greetings.</p><br/><p>This merry, pleasant scene was captured on the behind-the-scenes cameras.</p><br/><p>The actors stood in front of the cameras with faces full of excitement and expectations for the drama. Although the interviews were slightly different depending on their roles, the last question was asked to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly, please give a short comment about the project.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man in his forties looked in a certain direction. It was towards Lee Songha and Seo Jijoon as well as the two men who seemed to be from W&amp;U. The four of them were together and were receiving glances from other people. Although they couldn\u2019t tell what they were talking about, Lee Songha perked her ears at what the young man was saying and diligently nodded her head.</p><br/><p>Taking his eyes off them, the male actor cleared his throat and continued the interview.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, I said this more than a dozen times during the script reading session, but if there\u2019s a good vibe from the reading session, then the project will always be good. But the vibe from this reading session is just too good. Especially everyone\u2019s acting\u2026 Haa, if it\u2019s like this, then it might really-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Yoonok suddenly cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might bring bad luck. If the project becomes unlucky, are you going to take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>The male actor quickly made a gesture, zipping his lips.</p><br/><p>A similar scene occurred with other actors getting interviewed in front of other cameras.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit excited since we haven\u2019t started yet, but this project will be a hi-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey. Ma\u2019am told us not to say it, saying that it might bring bad luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, a short comment. I think this will really b-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cShush!\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone was unable to speak, the exterior of the script reading room became noisy.</p><br/><p>The chief producer, General Manager Song, who had been looking in through the door, quietly left.</p><br/><p>Although he checked Lee Songha\u2019s audition tape and he agreed to CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s suggestion of using this controversy to promote the project, he still had a few traces of unease left in his heart.</p><br/><p>That was why he watched the script reading session while acting like he was just passing by.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t infect other actors with his unease when he was the chief producer.</p><br/><p>Once he watched to his satisfaction, he made his way upstairs with light steps. When he, who had been temperamental until morning, was passing by while humming, the drama department\u2019s producers tilted their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the? Why is the general manager so happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. His mood keeps swinging back and forth. Maybe something like male menopause?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the Cat Guardian Ghost script reading session going on downstairs? Was he so shocked by Lee Songha\u2019s acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Song was on his way to the director\u2019s office. After knocking, he entered the room before he got the okay to enter and said to the director,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, about Cat Guardian Ghost. Should we get another timeslot? Instead only releasing short teasers, let\u2019s make a 50-minute behind-the-scenes-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe project from GTBN that got over 8% viewership ratings last time. They sent the cast and staff on a vacation to Cebu and released press releases bragging about it. We should send our cast and staff to somewhere better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you like this all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director, who had been going through files with a tired face, looked up.</p><br/><p>General Manager Song closed the director\u2019s office and said with a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit cautious since it might bring bad luck but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCat Guardian Ghost, I think it\u2019s going to be a huge hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Noon the next day.</p><br/><p>The first behind-the-scenes video created by the behind-the-scenes team and TVL\u2019s Content Planning Department employees was released.</p><br/><p>That video received hundreds of thousands of views in a few hours, was displayed on the main page of large sites, and once again broke into the real-time search rankings.</p><br/><p>Also, it quickly spread through forums and social media.</p><br/><p>{First look! Scene of TVL\u2019s Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019s first script reading session!}</p><br/><p>-I thought I would only notice the two leads, but the supporting actors are all unbelievable.</p><br/><p>-Are you ignoring God Joonok<sup>{1}</sup>? Just looking at the fact God Joonok is appearing on cable shows that they put a lot of effort with the cast. Besides Lee Songha, there are no holes in this cast.</p><br/><p>-Taken aback by the above comment ;; Am I the only one who was surprised by Lee Songha\u2019s acting?</p><br/><p>-I was freaking surprised as well ; I started watching without any expectations but ended up getting immersed by it. It was completely unexpected.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m constantly replaying Lee Songha\u2019s part. I keep getting sucked in *shiver*</p><br/><p>-Her looks could topple nations ; And she\u2019s really good at acting. Why are people swearing at her?</p><br/><p>-What do you mean she\u2019s great at acting lol You guys are trying your best with this 1-minute video haha</p><br/><p>-They probably picked out whatever was best from the few hours of script reading. Since TVL needs to try to put the controversy to rest.</p><br/><p>-Wow. At this point, it looks like you\u2019re bashing her for the sake of bashing her. So mean.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m not a fan or hater of Lee Songha, but looking only at the video, it looks like she\u2019s good?</p><br/><p>-Even considering that it has been edited, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s terrible. Let\u2019s all agree with that.</p><br/><p>-Please just do that well after practicing a ton. Then the controversy will completely disappear.</p><br/><p>-Since everyone was making such a fuss about it, I came to check it out, and this looks like it\u2019ll be fun?</p><br/><p>\u201cWas I the only one who was surprised by Lee Songha\u2019s acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to read the comments while maintaining their tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m constantly replaying Lee Songha\u2019s part. I keep getting sucked in *shiver*\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Lee Songha! He says he\u2019s getting sucked in! Wow, that guy\u2019s overreacting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung was creating a fuss. The makeup artist, who was zealously adjusting Im Seoyoung\u2019s makeup for the recording, couldn\u2019t take it anymore and shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung, stay put! Your eyeliner stuck out again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry, unni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you making such a fuss when the person involved is listening to it so calmly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Said LJ as she smirked next to her.</p><br/><p>Like she said, Lee Songha was quietly sitting down and getting her makeup corrected. From the outside, it looked like she was calm, but every time I read a comment, her lips would slightly curve upwards.</p><br/><p>She also looked at me as if she had something to say. Like now.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung urged with a bright smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, oppa. Read another one. Aren\u2019t there anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI found some too. I\u2019ll read you some!\u201d</p><br/><p>The stylist who had been diligently searching the internet at the back raised her hand.</p><br/><p>Every time she read a comment, laughter could be heard from inside the van. The traitor, who was driving, Kim Hyunjo at the back, Im Seoyoung, LJ, Lee Taehee and me as well as the makeup artists. There was no one who wasn\u2019t smiling.</p><br/><p>How long had it been since the mood was this good?</p><br/><p>It almost the first time since the controversy broke out since the mood did brighten up when Im Seoyoung and LJ squabbled with each other, even though the mood would quickly drop back down.</p><br/><p>However, it was different today.</p><br/><p>After the first behind-the-scenes video of the Cat Guardian Ghost was released today, Lee Songha\u2019s acting was once again heating up portal sites, social media outlets, and forums.</p><br/><p>This time, the scales were slightly tipped to Lee Songha\u2019s favor. Although there were still a lot of people criticizing her, those who had simply been watching this from afar had moved to protect Lee Songha because of this video.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe timing was just right. I was already worried because today was an outdoor recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor beside me was relieved.</p><br/><p>I nodded my head as well and looked out the window. I saw the outdoor stage set and a group of people talking with each other.</p><br/><p>The recording of Next K-Star today wasn\u2019t held at an open hell but in the middle of Hongdae<sup>{2}</sup>. Today\u2019s mission was to hold a guerilla concert<sup>{3}</sup> on an unfamiliar, confined stage for many, unknown people without a rehearsal.</p><br/><p>Even though I didn\u2019t think it would happen, I had been worried that a water bottle or something would be thrown at the stage during their performance. We were lucky that the public opinion was good.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo leaned towards the passenger seat I was seated on. He then glanced at the girls who were cheerfully talking with each other and said with a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what you said yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one thing I said to Kim Hyunjo yesterday.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s damn acting teacher Shim Kyungtaek and Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cI talked with Younghoon hyung, and we thought it wasn\u2019t a bad idea. If things don\u2019t work out as you planned, we just need to take some scolding. It also seems like Younghoon hyung and I can cover the rest as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I gulped down my saliva as I waited for his next words.</p><br/><p>Just then, Kim Hyunjo nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeet him tomorrow, that Shim Kyungtaek teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, it looks like it will stay on the real-time search rankings until night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park from the PR team looked at her monitor and smiled in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>The female employee poured drip coffee into three mugs as she nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis drama\u2026 Isn\u2019t its trendiness the best? Was there ever a cable drama that became such a big topic before it even started?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides those in a series, there wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the mood during the script reading session was really good. That Songha\u2019s acting was great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s like this\u2026 Then won\u2019t it overtake public broadcasts\u2019 viewership ratings on its first broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the male employee\u2019s words, the female employee waved her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, you dream too big. That\u2019s difficult. The lineup of public broadcast programs in the same timeslot is too good. There\u2019s Time Slip and Mermaid out of Water.\u201d</p><br/><p>While nodding, Team Leader Park added in,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the quality of the Mermaid out of Water script is good. We might be able to expect a 20% viewership rating for that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reaction from China is really good too. Although it was pushed aside because of Cat Guardian Ghost in Korea, the day an article about their reading session was released, it even reached top 3 in the overseas drama issues chart in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was possible because the female lead, Son Chaeyoung, and the male lead were quite popular in China. The publication rights for Mermaid out of Water had already been sold to the biggest Chinese online platform before its first broadcast.</p><br/><p>The female lead said in an expectant voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf things go well, Mermaid out of Water and Cat Guardian Ghost could be the top two dramas for the beginning of the year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019ll get busier,\u201d</p><br/><p>Agreed Team Leader Park, but the male lead licked his lips with unease,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader. But, why do I keep\u2026 thinking about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what Sunwoo said last time. That he had a bad vibe about Mermaid out of Water\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. That was a joke. Why are you taking that joke so seriously?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut his next words were that he got a good vibe from Cat Guardian Ghost and that he thought it would do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The laughter immediately stopped. Three pairs of eyes wordlessly rolled around.</p><br/><p>All three of them had read the synopsis of Cat Guardian Ghost. However, none of them ever thought that the project would become such a hot topic.</p><br/><p>Instead, they even remembered telling Jung Sunwoo, who held onto the synopsis like it was a treasure, that, while his passion was fit for a new recruit, he still needed to develop his discerning eye.</p><br/><p>While scratching her cheek, Team Leader Park patted the male employee\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, if Cat Guardian Ghost is a success, then Sunwoo\u2019s eye for projects is amazing. Anyone will admit that. But I don\u2019t know about Mermaid out of Water having a bad vibe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. No matter how bad it does, it\u2019ll at least be somewhat of a success. It\u2019s a project that can\u2019t fail even if it wants to. Unless the director or writer lose their mind and messes it up somehow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when the female employee added that in, the PR team\u2019s office door suddenly burst open.</p><br/><p>Then the one known to be innocence itself, Son Chaeyoung, walked in with a vicious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is she here again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe probably came to whine about how Cat Guardian Ghost got the top spot in real-time search rankings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, if I get a hole in my stomach, it\u2019s all her fault,\u201d</p><br/><p>Whispered Team Leader Park before getting up and greeting her. However, Son Chaeyoung didn\u2019t bother with the greetings and suddenly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did the director go? He wasn\u2019t in his office.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe director? He went to China yesterday morning with the CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung bit her red lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, are you lying to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re like this, I\u2019m not going to renew my contract with W&amp;U,\u201d</p><br/><p>She snapped.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park hid her astonishment as she let out a sigh. That was Son Chaeyoung\u2019s repertory she had heard exhaustively the last time it was time for her contract renewal. It came out like a habit whenever something she didn\u2019t like happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me why you\u2019re like this. Why would I lie to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said the director went to China yesterday morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You know the electronics commercial you and Dowon filmed in China? It was time to extend that contract so he went to have a meeting with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t have any ears?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s voice, which already seemed to have lost its already small amount of patience, grew louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the director personally went to Lee Songha\u2019s script reading session yesterday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> I think the meaning is pretty clear, but God + \u2018name\u2019 is usually a nickname for someone highly revered in their field.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> A region in Korea that is known for entertainment, clubs and the like.</p><br/><p><sup>{3}</sup> Guerilla concerts are spontaneous concerts performed usually by the street.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-52\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 52\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-54\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 54\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201218\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

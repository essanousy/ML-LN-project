Imagine if we performed on it again, and someone else fell and broke their bone. What would we do about Next K-Star then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I was about to fall too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have been worse if we got hurt, and if it affected our schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>Each of the girls said something.</p><br/><p>I glanced at Lee Songha, who was sitting in the rear seat, through the rear-view mirror. It wasn\u2019t like Lee Songha was showing she felt guilty by crying or anything. However, everyone knew that she wasn\u2019t in a good condition right now.</p><br/><p>When we stopped at a rest stop, we told the girls to pick out their lunches, and Lee Songha bought 3 people\u2019s worth of food. And she was currently in the middle of eating it all.</p><br/><p>They said she used to order night time delivery when she was stressed. She wasn\u2019t showing it, but there was no doubt she was stressed right now.</p><br/><p>If she simply cried, the other girls could comfort her, but since she bottled it all inside and said she was fine, there was nothing they could do right now except go along with her.</p><br/><p>It was the same for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my call, Songha raised her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it taste good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Would you like one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there still food left to give to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She ate so ferociously and yet there was still some left?</p><br/><p>When I looked through the rear-view mirror, Lee Songha was taking her time before holding something out. It was a chicken skewer coated with red sauce.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Do you want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you can eat it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could I take that from her?</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung stared at Lee Songha before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you eat so much and not gain weight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because she burns up as many calories as she eats, dummy. Since you don\u2019t exercise, you gain as much as you eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>At LJ\u2019s teasing words, Im Seoyoung widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, I exercise too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke. What exercise do you do besides breathing? What? Spoon lifts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, then what about you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung stuttered. She couldn\u2019t say any more. LJ wasn\u2019t a good opponent to ask, \u2018How much do you exercise?\u2019 since she boxed as a hobby. Im Seoyoung, wanting to say something, changed her target.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Taehee unni!? Taehee unni always takes over the sofa and rolls around instead of exercising when we don\u2019t practice, but she still doesn\u2019t gain weight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unni\u2019s nature, dummy. If you find it unfair, be born again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me a dummy, dummy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the two, the mood didn\u2019t have the opportunity to subside. When I glanced at Lee Songha, she had a faint smile as she watched their childish dispute.</p><br/><p>Noisy shouts could be heard for a while until they gradually died down. Soon, a silence fell in the van. When I looked through the rear-view mirror, they were all sleeping.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey fell asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they were drenched in rain, let\u2019s just let them sleep until we arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor said, who was sitting in the passenger seat, looking at his phone.</p><br/><p>Ah. Now that I thought about it, we still had something left to talk about.</p><br/><p>\u201cChoi Gunyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to ask me something before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. That.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he now remembered, the traitor showed a strange expression as he looked at me. I was curious what words would pop out of his mouth. Why did he bring up my senses, and what did he mean by he wanted to ask me something for a while?</p><br/><p>Just then, the traitor grinned as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s nothing?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I can\u2019t concentrate on driving because I\u2019m curious. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Do you think it won\u2019t bug me?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he himself said it wasn\u2019t anything, it wasn\u2019t like I could threaten him to open his mouth and spill whatever he was going to say. After complicating my thoughts, he coolly went back to his phone.</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t see what kind of person Choi Gunyoung was or what kinds of things he would do later on with my foresight ability, my heart would have been calm. It currently felt like I was walking around with a bomb I had no idea when would explode.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know whether he would explode or if my nerves would break first.</p><br/><p>When we arrived at Knet Studio, Kim Hyunjo was already waiting in the waiting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, I heard you fell. Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after Kim Hyunjo confirmed she was alright was he relieved.</p><br/><p>Unlike music broadcasts, the waiting time for Next K-Star wasn\u2019t long. We used the 30 minutes of free time to give a strong impression to other teams and greet the judges we saw for the first time.</p><br/><p>There was a total of three judges for Next K-Star. Producer Song Baekjin, who turned out many famous stars who could be recognized by name, Cha Suzy, who was a skilled vocalist of a former girl group, and a star songwriter Simon Lee, who often appeared on variety shows. I could easily tell what motives Knet had by casting these three.</p><br/><p>All three of them were characters with a history of malicious remarks.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t have the opportunity to talk with the judges for a long time. There were 8 participating teams, and each team had their members and staff, tens of people were gathered in front of the judges\u2019 waiting room so we were only barely able to greet them, let alone have a conversation.</p><br/><p>A few team loitered around the judges, but we returned to our waiting room without any lingering feelings. We chose to have the girls practice their song once more before their performance instead of getting looked at one more time by the judges.</p><br/><p>Soon after, an FD<sup>[2]</sup> came to each waiting room and informed everyone,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are recording in 5 minutes! Please standby!\u201d</p><br/><p>The makeup artists and stylists were left to watch through the monitors in the waiting room while the rest of us moved.</p><br/><p>After getting out of the confusion that was the waiting room hallway and sitting in the spectator seat in the open hall, I could see the entire filming site. It was completely different from the simple filming set from before. My mouth opened at the overwhelming scale.</p><br/><p>Rails were installed on the high ceiling, and all sorts of different lights hung down and repeatedly flashed on and off.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t step there! If the camera goes out, it\u2019ll be big trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReset the judges\u2019 table so that the product placement display nicely!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPut mics on the cast. Did you put them on standby?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone besides Cha Suzy! She said she was changing her outfit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said that her outfit concept was completely different from the other judges so she was going to change her outfit! She said it\u2019s almost here through an express delivery service and that she will be out in 10 minutes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Below the stage, the staff were busy shouting and running around. Since everywhere I looked was interesting, I looked around at my surroundings before stopping my gaze on Neptune. The girls had been busy looking around last time, but this time, they were focused with earphones in their ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou both turned off your phones, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo turned to look at the traitor and me and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very troublesome if you move around down there and block or touch a camera so be careful. Don\u2019t forget if a cameraman asks for an interview to carefully think about each of your answers 2 or 3 times before answering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there will be more instances where I leave it to you guys from now on, watch carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>My ears pricked. Although I clearly knew that I had a lot left to learn, it was definitely exciting to be responsible for everything myself. Even though I would feel a larger sense of responsibility, the sense of achievement at the end of the day would be greater.</p><br/><p>We were nodding our heads when someone said from behind,</p><br/><p>\u201cWatching the girls, teaching new recruits, you have it hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, it was Sugar Cats members and their chief. We passed each other a few times in our last filming, and maybe it was because Sugar Cats looked dishonest every time I saw them, but their manager didn\u2019t give a good impression either.</p><br/><p>The Sugar Cats chief glanced at Neptune and laughed,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Neptune\u2019s working hard. Isn\u2019t today a battle to see who gets the least criticism anyways? The production crew said they were going to go strong in the beginning, and all three judges are the types to say things without a filter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing we can do about the judges coming on strong since the show needs a reaction from the start. Still, those who everyone thinks did well would be pumped up by the judges, so it all depends on how they do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sugar Cats chief grinned at Kim Hyunjo\u2019s aloof reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think a lot of them will be like that? Those judge\u2019s standards are so high. Well, I don\u2019t care whether they come on strong or not, I just hope the ratings are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only the two of them. There were many people around us who were worried about the ratings. Well, in variety programs like this, there was nothing more important than the ratings. The only person who was involved in Next K-Star and wasn\u2019t worried about the ratings was me.</p><br/><p>As for me, I already knew that Next K-Star would get a high rating and would get additional seasons. I wished that the first broadcast was released quickly so I could personally experience Neptune\u2019s rise in popularity. Only then would the girls not experience the illogical events like this morning, and I could increase our area of activity.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung. Did you practice a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sugar Cats leader, Han Saetbyeol, suddenly leaned out. Im Seoyoung frowned slightly as she took off her earphones.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I did as much as I could.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You had a lot of time. So lucky. We had so many other schedules that we didn\u2019t make a lot of time to practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>If someone else had said it, I would have thoughtlessly glossed over it, but after bumping into each other a few times, I always heard her words through a translator. \u2018We didn\u2019t have enough time to practice because we had other schedules, but since no one calls for you, you had a lot of time to practice.\u2019</p><br/><p>If someone said I was a narrow-minded person, I had nothing to say, but I really wish they came down after being criticized by the judges to the point where not even ashes were left.</p><br/><p>Just then, LJ, who was next to Im Seoyoung, mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you should have practiced instead of staying in front of the judges\u2019 waiting room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Han Saetbyeol\u2019s expression distorted, LJ shrugged her shoulders. That moment, both sides became busy, checking to see if there were any cameramen nearby.</p><br/><p>Even as I felt reassured after confirming the cameramen were far away, I inwardly felt refreshed at LJ\u2019s straightforward words. To be honest, it felt like a 10-year indigestion was cleared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung pinched LJ\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Did I say anything wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do if there was a camera?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fights between children would become fights between parents. Once it seemed the girls were getting in a fight of nerves, the mood between the chiefs became chilly. Kim Hyunjo and the Sugar Cats manager didn\u2019t continue their conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cEach team member put on your mics and sit at the very front seats! We will be recording soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>The production crew member\u2019s voice resounded loudly.</p><br/><p>The girls took their earphones off and got up. Kim Hyunjo patted each of their shoulders and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard, right? Even if the judges criticize you harshly, just think that they are being harsh because it\u2019s a show and don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, oppa. After getting wet in the rain this morning, my mentality has become incredibly strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung clenched a fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will come back after showing everything I couldn\u2019t show this morning!\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>[1]</sup> Koreans say this in a sense that since something bad happened to you, you have prevented any further bad things from happening.

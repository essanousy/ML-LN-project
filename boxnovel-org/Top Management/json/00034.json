He\u2019s team 3\u2019s Luck Thrower?\u201d</p><br/><p>People I had never talked to before acted as if they knew me as they passed by. There were even people who chattered from a distance.</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>It seemed that I wasn\u2019t aware of something. Was it because the news of what happened yesterday spread? Someone tapped my back as I was looking for someone I knew to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuck Thrower, you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Kim Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, chief. But what are you calling me? What is Luck Thrower?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRumors that you rejected Sung Dowon spread like wildfire. There are no secrets in this goddamn place. Anyways, your nickname changed from Team 3\u2019s Lucky Charm to Team 3\u2019s Luck Thrower. As the guy who throws away luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say the director personally came up with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>My social image, would it be okay like this?</p><br/><p>I was about to think about it more seriously when Kim Hyunjo hurried me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go down quickly. A film crew will be here soon. Gunyoung went to receive them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA film crew?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe discussed filming an insert of the girls practicing.\u201d</p><br/><p>There indeed was a schedule for Neptune today. Since the Next K-Star mission filming would be tomorrow, they said they needed a scene of them practicing to edit in later.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t we schedule it for 5?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey originally planned on filming another team first, but their local shoot is taking longer than expected and the schedule messed up. So they said they\u2019d film us first before going to them. In any case, we\u2019re the easiest to push around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo grumbled worryingly on our way down to the basement practice room.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Jieun needs to push them hard. I wonder if she\u2019s going too easy on them in front of the camera.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ms. Jieun was the vocal trainer helping us with the filming today. I saw her in a meeting last time, her face was cute, and she was really short. She had been a faceless singer<sup>{2}</sup> for a few years before becoming a vocal trainer.</p><br/><p>\u201cShoots like this are more effective than multiple interviews saying they practice for hours every day or that they try hard. Then viewers will think positively of them as they think, \u2018They practiced hard. It\u2019s not easy being a girl group.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded my head as we entered the practice room. I saw the girls dancing and singing without the instrumentals in preparation for the mission. The trainer had her arms crossed as she watched them.</p><br/><p>I quietly entered and watched them practice as well. Admiration unknowingly welled up inside me.</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t have a good ear for music, Lee Taehee especially sounded amazing. It was to the point where it was amazing that such a rich and powerful voice came out of a slim girl who weighed less than 50kg.</p><br/><p>Even as she sang while dancing so lively, there was no hint of her voice wavering as it resounded out. She even sang the high notes so easily that if someone who didn\u2019t know anything saw her, they would think it was easy.</p><br/><p>While I was watching in a happy mood-</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gosh.</p><br/><p>The girls immediately paused at their trainer\u2019s shout. Lee Songha, who had been called out, lowered her head while wiping her sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re like this with your title track that you\u2019ve practiced for over half a year, how are you going to prepare for the other missions? Are you going to embarrass me? You are going out in front of the whole country, would you like it if people swear at me for debuting unprepared kids?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be like that, ask them to play a recording for your part!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fierce remarks that even made me, who was watching, flinch rained down on her. It seemed this hadn\u2019t happened once or twice as Lee Songha vigorously lowered her head and repeatedly said she was sorry. I was worried she might cry, but I didn\u2019t see any hints of that happening. Instead, the other girls glanced at her with sympathetic eyes.</p><br/><p>No, but\u2026 I didn\u2019t think she did badly enough to be punished so severely.</p><br/><p>After becoming Neptune\u2019s manager, I started to monitor music broadcasts of other groups, and to be honest, Lee Songha was average. With my biased perspective, she was slightly better than average.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t at the level of \u2018she\u2019s really good at singing\u2019, but it wasn\u2019t like she was bad.</p><br/><p>It only sounded like she wasn\u2019t very good compared to Lee Taehee, who was overwhelmingly good at singing, LJ, who didn\u2019t lose to others in rapping, and even Im Seoyoung, who specialized in dancing but was good at singing as well. Songha wasn\u2019t so bad that she would be called incompetent in other teams.</p><br/><p>Also, she practiced so much.</p><br/><p>How wonderful would it be if your skill could increase by how much you practice, but it was simply regretful that it wasn\u2019t so. If even I, who was a spectator, thought this way, how frustrated would she be?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you came?\u201d</p><br/><p>The trainer, who had spotted us now, approached us with an awkward expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, are we going to start filming now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe film crew will be here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do during the filming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do what you normally do. Like now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo gave a satisfied expression as he nodded.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, the traitor came in with the Next K-Star film crew. They were the young producer and writer I saw during our get-together. There were also a film director and other staff who held boom mics and lights. As people came in, the practice room became pack instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take good care of us. We\u2019ll only shoot for 30 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer said as he yawned.</p><br/><p>Then the film crew really filmed for exactly 30 minutes and left. It looked to me that there would be one or two shots of the girls practicing, and the rest would be the trainer pointing out their faults. It especially looked like shots of Lee Songha getting criticized to the point of turning to dust would be broadcasted.</p><br/><p>I sincerely hoped that when viewers watched this, they would think, \u2018That\u2019s too much. She didn\u2019t so bad to be criticized so severely.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo came up to me as I was cleaning up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the rest of the girls to Gunyoung, you take Songha to meeting room B. I\u2019ll bring Younghoon hyung there. We need to finish our talk from yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to wonder when he would bring that up as well.</p><br/><p>I passed between the completely exhausted girls, who were flopped all over the place whispering that they thought the shoot went well, and found Lee Songha. She was in the corner, lying facedown on the ground like laundry.</p><br/><p>Did she faint?</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I called her, she shot back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief and the team leader want to have a talk, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha grabbed her bag and left. The girls behind her saw her off.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, have a good talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo tell the team leader exactly what you heard, you dummy!\u201d</p><br/><p>We got on the elevator, and I pressed the fourth-floor button.</p><br/><p>Since we were in a small, contained space, I could hear her panting. When I looked at Lee Songha and her heaving shoulders, she looked like a kid who had come back after a sprint. Sweat dripped from her forehead, chin and even down her long neck.</p><br/><p>Still, she never said that it was hard\u2026 I didn\u2019t know whether to say she was praiseworthy or foolish. Or if she was resolute.</p><br/><p>To be honest, it looked like her heart had it tougher than her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour vocal teacher was scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe might have been more severe because a film crew came today.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said these words in hopes it would make her feel a bit better, but she tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe teacher was going easy on us because there was a film crew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That was going easy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we are actually practicing, she\u2019s 10 times scarier. Also, this is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>A thought suddenly popped up.</p><br/><p>She was someone who could say that it was nothing after getting punished so severely and even 10 times more severely. But when she was getting acting lessons, she had become stressed and was having a hard time. To the point where she would be depressed while eating 3 servings worth of food at night before eventually quitting.</p><br/><p>Fucking bastard. Just how harsh was he on her?</p><br/><p>Although I hadn\u2019t met him yet, the teacher was becoming a monster in my mind.</p><br/><p>I left Lee Songha in meeting room B and brought the muffins I bought on my way to work. She probably had no energy after practicing, filming, and getting punished, so she should have some snacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, these are muffins, do you want to ea\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I bought it for everyone, so you eat one first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who had pounced on the muffin box and was about to open it, paused.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust one? Are there different kinds?\u201d</p><br/><p>She asked while giving me a serious look.</p><br/><p>As if she was asking why I was making her make such a difficult decision.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, I was the uncle of quadruplets.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they are all the same. There\u2019s no need to choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha acted as though someone was going to steal it if she hesitated and quickly grabbed one. A fist-sized muffin with walnuts on top disappeared in a blink of an eye. I wasn\u2019t exaggerating, it really disappeared in a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>What the, did she drink the muffin?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha picked up and ate the crumbs on the table as well, yet she licked her lips as if she was still unsatisfied. She might have some talent as a food fighter. Since her looks were amazing, she could make easy money broadcasting herself eating food<sup>{3}</sup>.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bought one for myself as well, but you can have it since I don\u2019t really like them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was happy, really happy. It seemed it was tasty.</p><br/><p>She was a girl whose expression didn\u2019t change much, but it was good to see her happy expression when she ate. Although it came with a ridiculous price of 4,000won<sup>{4}</sup>, and I would never buy one for myself, when I saw her eating happily, it didn\u2019t feel like a waste at all.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and the team 3 leader didn\u2019t arrive even after Lee Songha had finished off two muffins. I was glancing at the door when Lee Songha looked through her bag, making ruffling noises. She brought out a stack of A4 papers.</p><br/><p>It was the Cat Guardian Ghost synopsis.</p><br/><p>\u201cI read\u2026 everything you gave me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? How was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The synopsis wasn\u2019t much, but I asked just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe unnies<sup>{5}</sup> said it was meh.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI especially find the story at the end fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha flipped the synopsis and showed me.</p><br/><p>An outline of the beginning plot of Cat Guardian Ghost was attached at the very end. Although there were many synopsises with story-like outlines, maybe it was because Writer Hong Jumi was a romance novel author, but hers felt like a genuine novel. I, too, enjoyed this part the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich character do you like the most?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha flipped the page forward and pointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was almost about to shout.</p><br/><p>The interpreter Jung Haewon.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha pointed at her.</p><br/><p>I read the synopsis tens of times when I got it as well. I substituted each female character with Lee Songha and imagined which of them suited her the best.</p><br/><p>And I hoped that if Lee Songha was to do this drama, she would choose the role of Jung Haewon. It wasn\u2019t because of the information I received from the future, but because I truly felt this character was appealing.</p><br/><p>Also, because it suited Lee Songha well.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Explained last chapter, but I changed it to Lucky Charm/ Luck Thrower (as in a person throwing luck away). This line is referring to how the raws, Bokdongee and Bokdangee, sound similar.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> A singer whose face is not known. Only releases songs.</p><br/><p><sup>{3}</sup> Reworded for flow but the author is talking about Eating Show/Social Eating popular in Korea.

I unconsciously frowned. Has there ever been a good result from their discussions?</p><br/><p>-That, crowdfunding thing. We decided to invest a lot in it. Friends need to help each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to help, just watch the film. Did you watch Alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>-There\u2019s no need to feel any burden. Although we promised never to exchange money between each other, the situation this time\u2019s a little special. We decided to consider like giving you your wedding gift and invest five thousand won each.<sup>{1}</sup> Friends need to help each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I said, if you want to help- How much?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Five thousand won each.</p><br/><p>I hung up immediately.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin, the casting director, grinned from the passenger\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are quite a few people like that around me too. People interested in crowdfunding City Jungle. There were a lot of people who bet on whether your next project would be a success or not for fun, and now it seems like you set up the playing field for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin loosened his tie as he looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere must be more around you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are.\u201d</p><br/><p>My family members, relatives, and even people beyond that were curious. There were a few people who asked me to tell them how the film was after the shoot or how people reacted to internal screenings. It felt like I was on a gambling table.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there too many people here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin said in astonishment as he looked out past the parking lot.</p><br/><p>The crowd was so large that you might think we were at a flea market on a holiday.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be okay? A lot of people might recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put a thick, clunky pair of glasses and a hat over my naturally tangled hair. My face reflected in the rear-view mirror looked slightly different. When I got out holding a light jacket, Chief Lee Kyojin, who got out before me, raised his brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? It\u2019s a bit weak considering you\u2019ve come prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have one more.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied as I put the green jacket on like a cloak. Chief Lee Kyojin burst laughing after seeing a university\u2019s name in big letters on the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which department\u2019s jacket that is, but it\u2019s quite intense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a prop for a drama. A stylist brought it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Disguised as a university student, I entered the flea market with steadfast steps. People had laid out mats from the park to the road, and people buying and selling were noisily mixed together. The scene was full of vigor.</p><br/><p>The face I was looking for was in a place with easels and portrait paintings.</p><br/><p>A painter, who gave off a heart-warming feeling, and a spot between his clients were particularly still.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>The painter said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>The child sitting in front of him straightened his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister, when will it be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEndure for a bit longer. I\u2019m trying to an especially good job for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The parents pacified the grumbling child. They waited expectantly.</p><br/><p>The painter painting the child\u2019s portrait gave off a different mood. Unlike his colleagues, who wore simple t-shirts, he wore a dress shirt on and a professional apron with its strings tied tightly around his waist.</p><br/><p>His black hair looked soft, and he wore a lightly faded pair of glasses and a black face mask.</p><br/><p>His expression was somewhat gloomy, and his actions were delicate.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin admired.</p><br/><p>The young painter\u2019s gaze alternated between the paper and the child\u2019s face before his hand started moving again. As mood elevated to where it seemed like a masterpiece was about to be unveiled, passersby stopped in their tracks and tilted their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, doesn\u2019t that painter look like he has a story?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Just admit he\u2019s handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s good at painting too. Let\u2019s go get our portrait too. How much is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree thousand\u2026 Huh? Only he\u2019s doing it for free. Why is he drawing for free?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Is he just volunteering?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two women stood in line as they tilted their heads.</p><br/><p>Soon, the painter put down his pencil. The child was hopping in his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister, is it done yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done, but I don\u2019t like it very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease show me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The child\u2019s small hand snatched the paper away. The moment the child looked at the painting he had held his breath in expectations for, he flinched. Even his parents, who were happily watching, flinched. The women who were waiting in line also glanced at it and flinched.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a portrait. It was an abstract painting.</p><br/><p>Besides there being a mouth, nose, and eyes on a face, there was nothing similar.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mister, what is this? Did you paint this with your feet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI painted it with my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this me? Do I look like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be this bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>The irritated child looked at other painters\u2019 works beside him and shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cOther misters and sisters are drawing really well! Why is yours like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChild.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man wearing a baseball cap behind the painter cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe painting\u2019s like that because it\u2019s free. If you want a better portrait, go next door, pay three thousand won, and ask them to draw it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while grumbling, the child took the portrait and left. Of course, the women who were waiting in line also left. The painters next to them laughed like he caught another one.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you planning to live off your paintings if your skills are this bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s works are always a bit peculiar\u2026 Team leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup recognized me and got to his feet.</p><br/><p>Then, the street painter, Nam Joyoon, smiled with a welcome face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you? There are more people than expected. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon nodded. Kim Hyunsup replied for him,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in disguise. He\u2019s wearing glasses and a mask, and his hair his unkempt, so no one can recognize him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone who recognize me even with my glasses off though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say it\u2019s because you\u2019re in disguise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup patted Nam Joyoon\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>I watched Nam Joyoon pack his things and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really looked like a painter when I was watching you. How is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve become used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gotten used to being cursed at.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup joined in again.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just watch and imitate painters? Do you really have to give people, who came to have good memories, your paintings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than drawing then not giving them it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I introduced them to Chief Lee Kyojin as they got up.</p><br/><p>He examined Nam Joyoon since the moment he saw him and was still looking at him after I got painters coffee from a nearby coffee truck.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suggested a few actors for the role Mr. Nam Joyoon played in Alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin said while licking his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cMinor role actors, stage actors, musical actors, and even aspiring actors attending acting school. I showed Director Choi Sungwon hundreds of people, but he rejected them all after seeing them audition. That was why I honestly thought Team Leader Jung pulled some strings when I heard you got cast. I was wondering how well you\u2019d do.\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze looked at me and Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were really great. I was convinced as soon as I saw.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lee Kyojin\u2019s eyes curved like willow trees.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that you\u2019d be quite good for the artist with a \u2018distorted sense of aesthetics\u2019 after reading City Jungle\u2019s scenario, but it\u2019s much better seeing you in person. I feel pumped to cast supporting roles since you fit so well as the lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you already reserve tickets?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you come to see? If you buy tickets now, we\u2019ll give you a 20% discount!\u201d</p><br/><p>Promoting part-timers handed out pamphlets. They looked at me, Chief Lee Kyojin, Nam Joyoon, and Kim Hyunsup before clinging to Kim Hyunsup, who looked like the easiest target. Chief Lee Kyojin waved his hand like he was chasing flies away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already reserved our tickets, and we are on our way to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time we arrived at the small theatre, our hands were full of promotional posters for plays.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup was astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so crazy here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is after they started cracking down on illegal promoters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin shrugged. We passed the ticket booth and went down to the first basement floor. The walls were filled with pink posters. At the very bottom of the casting board, we saw pictures of the actors appearing today.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this fellow here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin pointed to the middle of the casting board.</p><br/><p>A company employee role. Park Hyejae. He was the reason why we came all the way here.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin and I went through hundreds of profile picture for one of the important supporting roles, the hitman. Park Hyejae was an actor suggested by an agency manager.</p><br/><p>His long eyes didn\u2019t have double-eyelids gave off quite the impression. He\u2019s been doing plays for eight years or so?</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish his acting was good too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe manager who suggested him said it was really good, but we need to see for ourselves. If we simply believe whatever they say, all their suggestions are prettier than Lee Songha and better at acting than Park Hyeseung<sup>{2}</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>We went up to our designated seats. People\u2019s gazes focused on us when we all sat down in a line.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup lowered his baseball cap visor as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWas there a need for all four of us to come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe role has a lot of scenes with the lead. The image becomes clearer if I see them both together, so it\u2019ll be helpful. There are also cases where actors don\u2019t work well together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it would have been great if Ms. Lee Songha came along as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Songha will stand out no matter where she goes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup returned to his seat with a bitter expression at my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be less eye-catching than four guys sitting together like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the people who filled the seats were couples. Or two women. With four guys sitting in a row amongst them really was a strange sight. Also, the group was too awkward to be considered friends.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup grumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we sit in pairs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that\u2019ll look stranger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s act like theatre employees on business than to enjoy ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin took out City Jungle\u2019s scenario. Kim Hyunsup also took out a scenario from a bag containing his painting tools. Nam Joyoon didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s gazes and his gaze was fixed on the stage after getting ready to watch the play.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin flipped over a page filled with memos as he admired,</p><br/><p>\u201cI felt this while reading it, but the details are really good. I read a lot of crime/action scenarios, but the dialogue in this one seems particularly realistic. It seems the director did a lot of research.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I heard,\u201d</p><br/><p>I brought up what Forest\u2019s CEO told me in the past,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Oh Hyunkyung actually borrowed money from a loan shark and didn\u2019t pay it back for two or three months back when she was editing the scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo see their reaction. This is a scenario made with blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are other things to try on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup looked frightened. Chief Lee Kyojin made a stiff smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe director seems to have risked her life on this project then. Someone like her is also critical of actors. You should prepare yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>While we were chatting, the lights turned off and the play began.</p><br/><p>It was my first play in a long time, so I got completely absorbed in it. The screenplay was quite good, and the actors\u2019 acting skills were very good. There wasn\u2019t a single familiar face. I guess there really were a lot of unknown talented actors.</p><br/><p>Park Hyejae shined amongst them. Of course, he didn\u2019t shine in only my eyes.</p><br/><p>There was no need to discuss. Park Hyejae and the other actors came out after the play ended. The actors murmured to each other after discovering us. I heard them mention autographs, fans, and pens.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Kyojin skillfully took out his business card and approached them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Park Hyejae?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a casting director. Would you like to audition for a movie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their murmurs grew louder. Park Hyejae took Chief Lee Kyojin\u2019s business card. The other actors stuck closer and looked at it with doubtful eyes. It was normal for them to be wary. There were too many scammers in this industry.</p><br/><p>Just as I was wondering if it would be good for Nam Joyoon to take off his mask, the actress who played the female lead widened her eyes when she saw me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Koreans give money at weddings. Here, his friends are saying they\u2019d give him ~$5 each.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> I don\u2019t think this person has ever been mentioned.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-208\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 208\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-210\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 210\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201519\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

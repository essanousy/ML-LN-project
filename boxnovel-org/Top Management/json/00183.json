It made it feel like this was an extension of my work.</p><br/><p>I put on prescription-less glasses and a hat and headed towards the subway station. It has been a long time since I\u2019ve taken public transit. I hadn\u2019t been able to go out this freely since Making Film broadcasted either.</p><br/><p>I saw celebrities\u2019 faces everywhere I looked on the main street. Outdoor display panels, posters, banners, and billboards.</p><br/><p>There was something unique about this normal view to me. Pretty Girls\u2019 new song playing from an open caf\u00e9, and a bus stop with a poster of a soda drink that Neptune is negotiating a contract extension with.</p><br/><p>Although I had gathered a bunch of posters at home, seeing them outside like this felt completely different. When people showed interest in them, my heart tingled, and I felt proud.</p><br/><p>It also gave me the drive to jump up the steep stairs.</p><br/><p>When I saw a male actor displayed on the banner of a clothing brand, I hoped Nam Joyoon would become more successful and did something like that as well. When I saw a concert poster, I wanted Neptune to hold their own concert. And when I saw foreigners, I dreamed about Lee Songha\u2019s debut into America.</p><br/><p>My thoughts extended out like spiderwebs.</p><br/><p>When I saw an actor that I had a good impression of, I thought about which company they were currently signed with and wondered when they would be available on the free agent market. When I saw someone with a unique aura, I wondered whether they aspired to be celebrities.</p><br/><p>I saw Lee Songha wherever I looked on my way to the station.</p><br/><p>There was a poster of her on a contact lens specialty shop, and on the same block, photos of Lee Songha wearing her sponsored earrings and necklace in a jewelry store. She was also in a soju banner at a BBQ restaurant.</p><br/><p>Seeing the girls, who I was more familiar with seeing with my own eyes, gave me a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t the model for that soju originally Son Chaeyoung? When did they change it to Lee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while now, you shut-in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young men chatted in front of the banner.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Son Chaeyoung prettier than Lee Songha? That\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDumbass, it simply comes down to preference between those two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to date Lee Songha but marry Son Chaeyoung. Lee Songha seems like someone I need to put on a pedestal, but Son Chaeyoung seems more like an elegant lady. Someone who\u2019ll put on an apron at home, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nope, you\u2019re wrong.</p><br/><p>Elegant lady? Those words will bring you an early death.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, of course, you need to put Lee Songha on a pedestal if you marry her! They say she earned 10 billion won last year!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat useless debate. They\u2019ll date and marry celebrities or conglomerate families!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Can\u2019t we even imagine it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The chatting men cursed each other as they disappeared.</p><br/><p>I stared at Lee Songha\u2019s banner momentarily before going on my way.</p><br/><p>The subway station was crowded. Only after standing for two stops did I finally find a spot to sit. I put earphones on and pressed my hat down even more. Since I wasn\u2019t a celebrity, people would usually stare out of interest when I was discovered, but some weird people appeared on occasion.</p><br/><p>I observed people\u2019s daily lives through my glasses.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, look at the man next, next, next to you. Isn\u2019t he Jang Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo you mean.</p><br/><p>A woman, who seemed like a university student, poked her friend\u2019s side and glanced at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so? Check if there\u2019s Lee Songha nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would a celebrity ride the subway? They would be in a van or car!\u201d</p><br/><p>Our girls ride the taxi a lot too. Sometimes, even scooters.</p><br/><p>Thinking about their whispers, a smile unknowing crept up my face. I didn\u2019t drive my minivan because it felt like this was an extension of my work, but I kept thinking about the girls and work. Especially Lee Songha. It seemed like she had completely rented out a corner of my mind.</p><br/><p>It made me realize that my work was deeply ingrained in my life.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is soy sauce fried chicken, and this is green onion fried chicken. Eat until you explode.\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw two chicken as bait to the rushing quadruplets. I used to be fine when the four of them clung to my arms and legs, but it was impossible now. I didn\u2019t dare. They grew up like beansprouts during the time I didn\u2019t see them. Has it been two years since I last saw them?</p><br/><p>Quickly snatching the chickens from my hands, the kids chattered,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want us to eat until we explode? Uncle, are you underestimating us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been one chicken for each of us since last year. That\u2019s showing proper respect to the chickens!\u201d</p><br/><p>What respect? My brother and sister-in-law must be suffering a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, when are you planning on making our cousins?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma and grandpa were sad, saying how we\u2019re all grown up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that our cousins are also quadruplets! Quadruplets are hereditary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say such scary things.\u201d</p><br/><p>I entered the living room while pressing my head. It was filled with the smell of roasted sesame oil. I heard something boiling and something frying in a pan. It has been a long time since I heard these sounds.</p><br/><p>My sister-in-law walked out of the kitchen. She had a bright smile on her face, which looked so young it was unbelievable that she had four children.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has it been? Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019ve seen you on TV, but you seem like a celebrity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, did you see the broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we did! The younger coworkers at my work watched it a lot. I was really tempted to tell them that you were my brother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have told them. It\u2019s not a huge secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. If I tell them, it\u2019ll be exhausting for me and a bother for you. They\u2019ll definitely make a fuss, asking for someone\u2019s autograph. Also, they\u2019ll pester me about inviting celebrities to our company track meets or weddings. It\u2019s so obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>My sister-in-law said bluntly before beaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s work these days? Is it still fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s something I enjoy, so it won\u2019t do if it\u2019s not fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Go talk with your brother, lunch is almost ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as she said that, my brother tossed the book he was reading on the sofa. Then he brought me to the kids\u2019 room. The room with the bunk bed was messy. They had put up celebrities\u2019 autographs I had gotten for them on the walls, and albums were organized on their desk.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, what relationship advice? Are you dating someone? Are you thinking about marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>My brother urgently said. For someone who was usually boringly quiet, his eyes were particularly shining at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt your age, you date while thinking of marriage. At your age, I-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cHad four kids. I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat down on the floor and leaned against the bed. Then I picked my words. My mind was complicated when I thought about it myself, but I didn\u2019t know what to say first.</p><br/><p>This was difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dating anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen is it that, what do you call it, flirting situation? Or one-sided love?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a bit complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the person a celebrity?\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded.</p><br/><p>My brother paused for a moment before cautiously asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cA woman? Or a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was such an unexpected question that it broke the serious mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s because you said it was complicated. The entertainment industry is open to that. You said that you packed a lot of side dishes for Mr. Nam Joyoon last year too.\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>My brother\u2019s eyes became as large as saucers. Then he rummaged through the kids\u2019 desk and took out Neptune\u2019s mini-album photobook. He flipped through it and showed me a page. It was a photo of Lee Songha looked at the camera.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there another Songha around me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, even if you have high standards, isn\u2019t that too hi-\u201c</p><br/><p>He stopped mid-sentence and got up. He went out of the room and brought in two glasses of cold water. He was in such a hurry that the tray was overflowing with water. I gulped down the glass and glanced at the closed door.</p><br/><p>Then I began talking about what I had been holding back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Songha likes me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What? Did she tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I asked her if she likes me, and she said she didn\u2019t. Never. Even if she dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>My brother, who was listening with bated breath, frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I think she does. At first, I thought she was simply leaning on me, who was helping her out, because she was feeling a lot of pressure. But it\u2019s not. The more I look, you would have to be a fool not to notice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, I simply had my suspicions that she was acting this way because she had this excessive desire to have me to herself like Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon\u2019s relationship. But, no matter how I saw it, that wasn\u2019t the case. While I wasn\u2019t as quick-witted as LJ, I wasn\u2019t a complete idiot either.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen, when did it start?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a been a while. More than a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>My brother dumbly gaped his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you acted like you didn\u2019t notice all this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do if I acknowledge it?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked back while tilting my head. My brother fixed his glasses and pondered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you said she told you that she didn\u2019t like you. But if you like her back, you could try talking to her. A lot of celebrities date these days. Or is it because she can\u2019t have a dating scandal since she\u2019s a spokesmodel? Then you can just date in secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a secret in this industry. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The paparazzi was growing in the country.</p><br/><p>If this broke out, the advertisers would cause a fuss and it\u2019ll also negatively impact her image. It\u2019ll also slow the growth of her fanbase at an important time. In this industry, someone beloved today could be cast aside tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The public\u2019s reaction might be less intense if it was Seo Jijoon or Im Joowon, who appeared in the same drama. However, it would be iffy with me. There was no doubt that there would be more negative reactions than positive ones.</p><br/><p>However, the bigger problem was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we are in that sort of relationship, then I have to quit being her manager. There\u2019ll also be problems at work. If we continue to stick together like we are now, then there\u2019ll no end to nasty rumors. And if we break up, it\u2019ll be even more difficult to work with Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at Lee Songha\u2019s photo.</p><br/><p>The time we spent practicing reading her lines, experience hate comments and controversies, and eventually succeed while looking up at the same goal flashed past my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I acted like I didn\u2019t notice. It might also be why Songha\u2019s vehemently denying it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Above all other risks, I couldn\u2019t bear to risk shattering our current relationship.</p><br/><p>Rather than breaking a relationship with someone I would like to work forever for a love relationship that could one day go astray, it was better to bury my feelings.</p><br/><p>And I thought about this.</p><br/><p>If, after a few more years pass, I have a firm foundation in this industry and Lee Songha had reached a position where she could bear dating whoever she wanted\u2026</p><br/><p>If Lee Songha\u2019s feelings didn\u2019t change even then\u2026</p><br/><p>Maybe\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did, but why do you suddenly want advice?\u201d</p><br/><p>My brother asked again. The sentiments that filled my mind were wiped away. A familiar snake slithered in their place. I wet my mouth with the cold water before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve experienced a change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA change?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha said she wanted to stand on her own. She wants to try working with someone other than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The snake shed its skin. The smell was repulsive.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something I should be commending. The fact that Songha is trying to fix her excessive reliance on me. And it\u2019s a positive for her. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like poison was dripping from my voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like that Songha would depend on someone other than me. It also bothered me. It makes me want to do something crazy. So I\u2019m a bit confused right now. Is this the normal feelings of love for someone or an excessive possessive desire between a manager and celebrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was the second one\u2026</p><br/><p>I came to the thought that I might be the one who might use Lee Songha\u2019s weakness to tie her down and become disillusioned by myself and not CEO Baek Hansung. That I might be someone actually capable of that.</p><br/><p>I asked my brother, who looked taken aback, again,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think this is?\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> For context, general awareness of homosexuality is increasing in South Korea, but it is not as wide spread as some other countries.

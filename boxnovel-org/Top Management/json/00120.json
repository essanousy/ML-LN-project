Celebrities playing supporting roles sat around a center table with scripts, water bottles, and handmade cookies while managers sat on folding chairs near the walls.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Seo Eunkyo is in the basement dressing room. Why isn\u2019t she coming up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha isn\u2019t here yet. She\u2019s waiting to appear after her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be less embarrassed then. Even though there are four lead roles, looking at the script, it looks like Lee Songha\u2019s the main while Seo Eunkyo\u2019s playing the sub-lead? Doesn\u2019t this mean that she\u2019s been pushed back by a rookie? I bet she\u2019s ready to even snatch her soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I bet the tension from their first meeting will be intense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill there even be a fight? Do you think a young girl like her will be able to stand up against Seo Eunkyo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fortunate if she doesn\u2019t cry in the washroom. I already feel sorry for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, but do you think she\u2019ll be so upfront when Lee Songha has W&amp;U behind her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeo Eunkyo doesn\u2019t lose company-wise either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Excitement permeated their voices. They all had expectant looks.</p><br/><p>To see the spectacle that didn\u2019t concern them. Or more specifically, the psychological warfare between two successful actresses.</p><br/><p>Actors and managers glanced at the door multiple times.</p><br/><p>Just then, the door opened. Two people greeted them respectfully as they entered the room.</p><br/><p>They were surprised by Lee Kwanwoo\u2019s figure, which was larger than most security guards. They were surprised again when they saw Lee Songha. Her looks were enough to surprise them, who were used to seeing celebrities.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. There is a reason why advertisers call her a \u2018blue chip\u2019<sup>{1}</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s truly breathtaking. But the person she came with isn\u2019t Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The managers with various positions, such as road managers, chiefs, team leaders, whispered to one another.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas he kicked from being in charge of Lee Songha because of the scandal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer scandal was completely buried by Park Dojin and Sung Dowon\u2019s scandals. What a shame. I wanted to see the famous star manager once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do mean \u2018a shame\u2019? I heard he\u2019s gotten full of himself after a little publicity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, she\u2019s here, she\u2019s here!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if someone had pressed the mute button, the whispers came to an abrupt halt.</p><br/><p>A woman came in accompanied by two managers. Her face looked like it was drawn with a brush while she gave off an elegant aura akin to a maiden from a respectable family. She was called the goddess of award ceremonies as every dress she wore would become a hot topic. She was Seo Eunkyo.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo walked in while people greeted her.</p><br/><p>She then stopped in front of Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Lee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, senior. Hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha bowed her head once more. Arms crossed, Seo Eunkyo glanced Lee Songha up and down. A serious mood hung above this momentary silence.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the reading room perked their ears while pretending not to.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo swallowed dryly. The mood was strange. He recalled a drama he had enjoyed that was set in the entertainment industry. Someone would always try to start a fight in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>One which was accompanied by a high-level personal attack or splashing a cup of water on someone.</p><br/><p>Breaking the silence, Seo Eunkyo asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour one-piece dress is pretty. It\u2019s from Designer Kim Sukmoon\u2019s seasonal collection, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the name because I wear what\u2019s provided to me, but I think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a normal conversation.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo was relieved, thinking that dramas were simply dramas.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wear it from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wear his clothes often. So don\u2019t wear them. We can\u2019t have our outfits overlap while on a shoot. Designer Kim Sukmoon will probably prefer I wear his clothes than you. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood chilled.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo\u2019s eyes moved rapidly. He thought that this was too harsh even if she was her senior, yet Seo Eunkyo\u2019s managers looked calm as though this was nothing special.</p><br/><p>The other actors and managers didn\u2019t look like they planned on intervening. Instead, they were busy stealing glances. Their faces were filled with expectations, wondering whether Lee Songha would flee or become agitated and clash head-on after being rebuked.</p><br/><p>When Lee Songha didn\u2019t reply right away, Seo Eunkyo mocked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything? Are you sad that I told you not to wear seasonal item you finally obtained?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you have a problem with your senior\u2019s words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was sponsored to wear this dress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo faltered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSponsored? Designer Kim Sukmoon sponsored you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>A low laughter broke out somewhere.</p><br/><p>Taken aback, Seo Eunkyo\u2019s expression suddenly distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust look at how you look straight at me like that. I guess W&amp;U doesn\u2019t care about senior-junior relationships? Or are idols all like this? If you are so confident because you think you got the main female lead, you\u2019re mistaken. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t get that role, I got this role because my image suits being the darling of a rich family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, walking past Lee Songha, she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did an idol like you roll in from? Lowering our level. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her final question was directed at the supporting actors.</p><br/><p>The actors\u2019 eyes moved quickly. They were calculating how they should act so that their time on set would be free of troubles. The decision was quick as their future would be difficult if they were marked by someone like Seo Eunkyo.</p><br/><p>Concluding their calculations, the majority of actors gathered around Seo Eunkyo.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha stood alone under people\u2019s glances.</p><br/><p>Stomping his feet, Lee Kwanwoo sent a text.</p><br/><p>-Chief! Big trouble due to Ms. Seo Eunkyo!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>I wondered if something would happen in ten minutes.</p><br/><p>Yet it did. Apparently, it was big too.</p><br/><p>I ran up the stairs as soon as I received the text. I encountered a couple of familiar faces on the floor on which the reading room was located. Chief Sung, whose amiable character didn\u2019t suit his fox-like looks, and Im Joowon.</p><br/><p>Im Joowon began running as well as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, why are you running? Are we late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think something happened between Songha and Ms. Seo Eunkyo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s started already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Sung clicked his tongue as if he already knew.</p><br/><p>I opened the reading room door. Everyone simultaneously looked in our direction. I greeted them and quickly observed the mood. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t the worst situation. When he said there was big trouble, I thought gummy worms had been thrown.</p><br/><p>The mood was a bit odd though.</p><br/><p>Pretty and handsome actors crowded around Seo Eunkyo like a queen bee and her admirers. Lee Songha was sitting by herself.</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>I had my concerns but did they cast her out so directly? Were they middle schoolers?</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, I\u2019m over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha raised her hand up high and waved at me as if she thought I couldn\u2019t find her. Her hand was still holding onto her bag of gummy worms. I sat in the folding chair behind Lee Songha and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, if you\u2019re okay, then that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I let her continue eating her gummy worms as I heard the whole story from the recruit.</p><br/><p>Once I did, I became certain. That this was worse than middle school.</p><br/><p>\u201cIncidents like this are common in this industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEspecially women. Their power struggles are so childish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Joowon, who sat next to Lee Songha, said, clicking his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019d be if you were by yourself, but you\u2019re with me. I\u2019ll help you out. As people in the same company, we should help each other out.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said dependably.</p><br/><p>Just then, the door opened and someone entered.</p><br/><p>He had a brazen smile and a well-built frame. It was Yoon Taekyung. A celebrity amongst celebrities. At the appearance of this precious international star, who people desperately fought over to invite, the reading room became noisy. Greetings were exchanged in this heated atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Im Joowon shook Yoon Taekyung\u2019s hand as he admired,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you work out a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s because the director said there will be a lot of scenes where I\u2019ll be shirtless. I\u2019ve been taking care of my body by eating chicken breasts and smoothies after receiving the script.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You have a lot of shirtless scenes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Smiling as though he was teasing him, Yoon Taekyung briefly scanned Im Joowon up and down. Then he sat down a bit away from him.</p><br/><p>Now alone, Im Joowon turned towards us. Then, in a quiet voice, he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bastard disregarded me just now, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, rather than disregarding you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, why don\u2019t I have any shirtless scenes? Is my body no good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Joowon asked seriously while rolling his short-sleeve shirt up and looked at his belly.</p><br/><p>Chief Sung waved his hands as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s true. You are the slim, pretty boy style while Mr. Yoon Taekyung has a manlier look. The way you show off your charms are different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. If I take care of my body from now on, I can get a six-pack too. Tell the director to give me some shirtless scenes too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he said power struggles were childish, Im Joowon\u2019s eyes were ablaze.</p><br/><p>But it was a bit odd. People crowded around Seo Eunkyo. More people crowded around Yoon Taekyung. Lee Songha and Im Joowon were sitting by themselves.</p><br/><p>What was this sight which resembled two duck eggs floating in the Nakdong river?</p><br/><p>Chief Sung mumbled helplessly,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mood is progressing strangely.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood continued to progress strangely.</p><br/><p>The director and chief producer of PBS\u2019s dramas entered once the reading room was full.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, our international star, Mr. Yoon Taekyung! I danced when I heard you signed the contract. I believe in you. Please take care of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>They patted the shoulder of \u2018their international star, Mr. Yoon Taekyung\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, our goddess of award ceremonies! Ms. Eunkyo, let\u2019s definitely have you wear your dress on the red carpet for PBS\u2019s Best Performance Award. If this project is a success, we won\u2019t disappoint you when it comes to awards.\u201d</p><br/><p>They held the hand of \u2018their goddess of award ceremonies\u2019 as though it was made from gold.</p><br/><p>Although they shook Im Joowon\u2019s hand, there was a huge difference in their treatment. Their reactions were lukewarm when compared to Yoon Taekyung. At Lee Songha\u2019s turn, their reactions became frosty.</p><br/><p>No matter who saw it, their attitude showed they weren\u2019t satisfied with the decision to cast Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>When the director and chief producer left, Seo Eunkyo\u2019s nose shot up like Pinocchio\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell-Made Production was the one in charge of selecting the cast.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a complicated expression, Chief Sung said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe broadcasting company might not be happy that they chose Ms. Songha over Son Chaeyoung, who was their first pick. Still, there\u2019s no need to care about the broadcasting company. The ones who truly hold power in this current situation are different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Isn\u2019t the broadcasting company the ones in power?\u201d</p><br/><p>The recruit, Lee Kwanwoo, asked. Chief Sung shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is different for something like Royal Family. Well-Made brought over Chinese investors so their production budget is huge. The script is good and they have a good cast. On top of that, they got Yoon Taekyung. Seo Eunkyo has a decent following in China. Any public network will make room in their schedule for a project like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen is Well-Made the ones with power? Or the actors? Yoon Taekyung or Seo Eunkyo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Sung shook his head once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell-Made needs to keep supplying resources to make the project a success. Actors hold power until they sign. Their positions change as soon as they sign the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the ones with power\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the director and writer.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>They were the two people who truly held power in this current situation. The veterans at the helm of this enormous ship. Also, between the two, the writer held the most power.</p><br/><p>The charm of characters would dangle on her fingertips, and she controlled the actors\u2019 screen times.</p><br/><p>Chief Sung\u2019s eyes narrowed as he added,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can ignore other actors and the broadcasting company. They are people who will change their attitude at the flip of a coin if this project is a success. The problem is Writer Jang. Director Woo is the type to be faithful to the script. You have to get on Writer Jang\u2019s good side.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff entered the room as soon as he said that.</p><br/><p>Our attention focused on two people. One was Director Woo, who had facial hair from his sideburns to his chin. The other was Writer Jang, who glitter more than usual as she wore a set of large pearl earrings, necklace, and ring.</p><br/><p>Other people seemed to have the same thoughts as us as people particularly gathered around Writer Jang. We just got up to greet them as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Chief Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Woo approached me with steadfast steps before hugging me.</p><br/><p>His coarse beard brushed against my cheek. I got goosebumps. I was surprised, but Lee Songha looked more surprised than me. Her eyes became as wide as saucers despite being calm when she was being left out.</p><br/><p>Director Woo whispered in my ear,</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about it. That it\u2019s all thanks to you that we were able to take out hands off that mess before it was too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hoped that we could talk with a bit of distance between each other.</p><br/><p>I knew that this wasn\u2019t the right place to talk about Park Dojin because of all the listening ears, but this was a bit\u2026 I thought this, but with a sudden thought, I placed my hand on Director Woo\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>I decided it was a good idea to show I was friendly with the director.</p><br/><p>Especially in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>As expected, people\u2019s stinging gazes fell on me. The actors and even the managers looked in my direction and whispered to each other. \u2018Why are they so close?\u2019 \u2018How close are they?\u2019 Questions like these flashed on their faces.</p><br/><p>We were hugging for a while when Seo Eunkyo, who had been giving us a strange look, smiled brightly as she clung to Writer Jang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you were the writer who cast me. Thank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe role suited you very well. I wrote the script thinking about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Writer Jang replied. Seo Eunkyo looked so happy she could jump in the air as she hugged Writer Jang\u2019s shoulders as if telling us to look at them.</p><br/><p>She then politely said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it looks like Ms. Lee Songha feels pressured from suddenly becoming a lead, it\u2019s okay if you give me more scenes or even give me most the scenes. I\u2019ll handle them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wow. This queen bee. That was too much.</p><br/><p>I parted from Director Woo with a frown on my face when Writer Jang looked in my direction. As soon as our gazes met, Writer Jang\u2019s eyes slightly curved.</p><br/><p>Writer Jang brushed Seo Eunkyo\u2019s hands off her shoulders and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Seo Eunkyo. Am I a debuting writer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly picking up bad behavior. How dare you ask a writer to increase your scenes?\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Blue chip \u2013 a stock in a company known for quality, reliability, and profitability in both good and bad times.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-119\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 119\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-121\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 121\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201353\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

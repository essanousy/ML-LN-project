While I didn\u2019t know if it was his true face or if he was acting, his poor excuse for a smile was worse than not smiling at all.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader sighed, breaking the troubled silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hold personal meetings. The two of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pierced a deliciously cooked piece of stir-fried chicken and cabbage with my fork. The warmly melted mozzarella cheese stretched out. I put it in my mouth and chewed. Hmm, maybe it was because I was in a daze, but I couldn\u2019t taste it.</p><br/><p>In front of me, Kim Hyunjo was mechanically eating with his fork. He was probably thinking about the traitor who disappeared with the team 3 leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were going to tell you after resolving matters with Gunyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said while placing his fork down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were thinking about moving him to another team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Move?\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed surprised by my immediate question as Kim Hyunjo replied a little late.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re a chief, you can\u2019t be working like you have been like now. No matter how close you are, there will be trouble eventually if your positions are different. Because we can\u2019t move you right away, we need to move him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was today my birthday? Would everything go right for me today? Should I buy a lottery ticket?</p><br/><p>While I didn\u2019t show it outwardly, my excited hormones were dancing inside me. This welcome news made my heart swell as much as the news of my promotion. I might make today a personal commemorative day.</p><br/><p>I put my fork in my mouth again to hide my curving lips.</p><br/><p>Oh my god. The moment I bit into the juicy piece of chicken, it felt like a chicken crowed in my mouth, and the sweet, crisp cabbage covered my tongue. Then the semisweet, tasty cheese left the finishing touch.</p><br/><p>While I was in bliss, Kim Hyunjo continued talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either we send him back to Blackout\u2019s team or Team 1 or 2\u2026 But if he goes to Team 2, he\u2019ll definitely be in charge of Son Chaeyoung. I can\u2019t put him there. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re exiling him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo clicked his tongue and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a mess over there. Because of Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I guess she hasn\u2019t changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone beyond not changing, apparently, she\u2019s uncontrollable. It seems like she\u2019s acting out, daring us to renew her contract when she\u2019s acting like this, but the innocent are the ones suffering in the meantime. I hear a few road managers have quit already. The last guy even took the van and fled, telling the company to eat shit. The new recruit joining our team would have gone there if he was unlucky. He came back from the dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, there no peaceful day for those around Son Chaeyoung. She was a walking natural disaster. However, if the traitor went to that team, I might cheer for her hysteria since I wasn\u2019t the target of it.</p><br/><p>Just as I was thinking this, Kim Hyunjo added,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jo gave up and is letting her be. Things are going well over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was listening to him when a shiver suddenly went down my spine.</p><br/><p>Wait.</p><br/><p>In the future where I was assigned to Son Chaeyoung, I was a chief.</p><br/><p>An unfamiliar, handsome youth was following me while calling me \u2018Chief Jung\u2019. Seeing as I was wearing a short sleeve shirt, it was probably summer. The uneasiness which rushed towards me like the tide rippled at my knees.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of person is the new recruit? Is he a guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo smiled slightly as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see him before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. Well, I heard he easily passed the interview, so I guess he left a good impression.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t, right?</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t been able to think about it because I was focused on Neptune\u2019s album for a while, but even though I rejected Son Chaeyoung\u2019s proposal, I couldn\u2019t be certain that I changed the future I saw.</p><br/><p>I frowned at this unsettling feeling when Kim Hyunjo poured beer into my glass and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only know for sure after working with him. When I first met you, I didn\u2019t think you would be like this. When you came, wearing a full suit, I wondered if you would even last a week, yet here you are, already promoted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you, chief. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it. Go flatter someone else. Either way, I\u2019m sorry about the mood when we should have had a party or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think it\u2019ll take about a day for me to realize that this is real.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was serious.</p><br/><p>The first thing to do when I got off work today would be to examine the business cards properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it so apparent to Gunyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The topic returned to the traitor. Kim Hyunjo let out a stifled sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s enduring it now because he\u2019s mentally strong. How do you think he feels right now? He has a good personality and does a good job. If he was on any other team, he would be complimented constantly, yet no one showed him an interest during the six months you guys worked together. Since you\u2019ve been promoted now, he must be upset.\u201d</p><br/><p>I silently drank my beer. Kim Hyunjo continued to speak with a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Simon Lee\u2019s song he worked hard to get was tossed away because its performance was unexceptional. Honestly, I was surprised that you guys were so close. Do you know how many times I was worried that you two would start beating each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>I still wanted to fight him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was anyone else, they probably would have already quit from their insides twisting with a sense of inferiority. I think I would have been disturbed by you if I had less experienced, but Gunyoung, he really has a great personality. He\u2019s responsible. It\u2019s a shame to send him to another team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo\u2019s gaze was filled with regret.</p><br/><p>I was frustrated, unable to tell him he was being fooled. It felt like I had stuffed a box of steamed sweet potatoes down my throat. While I downed a glass of beer, it only washed away the surface of my frustration.</p><br/><p>I blocked my throat with another piece of chicken and ordered another beer. Think positively. Anyways, this frustration would end now. I no longer needed to waste mental power worrying since the traitor would be going far away.</p><br/><p>It would be the end of my six months of penance.</p><br/><p>Goodbye, traitor. It was shitty for the past six months, and let\u2019s not see each other again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say it because I was surprised before. Congrats on your promotion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this guy a zombie? Or a lover, no, an enemy from my past life?<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>The moment I saw the traitor return with a bright smile on his face, I almost threw the box of donuts at him in front of Kim Hyunjo and the team 3 leader. I barely managed to place the box on the desk, and the traitor casually asked if it was dessert and walked over.</p><br/><p>Oh my god. I felt like I was suffering from a never-ending nightmare.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader said with a distressed expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cGunyoung, you eat that, Luck- Sunwoo, I want to talk with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the team 3 leader, Kim Hyunjo, and I were sitting around a lounge table.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, hyung? How did your talk with him go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told him what we decided beforehand. \u2018Since the situation is like this, we should transfer you. Where do you want to go? We will do our best to cater to you, whether it\u2019s Team 1, Team 2, or Blackout.\u2019 Then he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he wants to stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>I should have drunk soju instead of beer. The shock was too big for me to listen to this with a sound mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, are you sure you explained to him properly? No, that means he\u2019ll be working under Sunwoo, and he\u2019s okay with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he felt bad to leave Neptune when it\u2019s such an important time for them after they all they had been through for the past six months. He said he was fine with working with Lucky Charm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it. I thought I was a squid that was finally going back to the sea after been stranded on dry land, yet this traitor was trying to cook me up on a stove.</p><br/><p>I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster all today. My stomach ached. Damn, if I was more delicate, there would be holes in my stomach and my mind would have melted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he said that, I recalled how Lucky Charm rejected Sung Dowon because he kept thinking of Neptune. I just didn\u2019t feel right. I did tell him to think over it since both of them will be uncomfortable, but Lucky Charm, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>My thoughts? My thoughts were that there was no need to think about it any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we never really had the chance to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, both of you were busy these days. You guys probably didn\u2019t have the time to talk frankly with each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t \u2018these days\u2019, there wasn\u2019t an opportunity for the past six months.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo looked a little worried, but the team 3 leader willingly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>I returned to the office. The traitor, who was eating a donut, glanced at me as if asking if we were done talking already. When I glanced behind me, the team 3 leader and Kim Hyunjo turned around and acted as though they weren\u2019t looking.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, the traitor, who was licking the sugar off his fingers, paused.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not act.</p><br/><p>We were in a small, sealed meeting room, a perfect location for us to talk.</p><br/><p>Rather than outside, where many people could hear us, the meeting room was probably better. The traitor was satisfied with this location. Since the lights were so bright that they irritated me, I turned them off. The darkness was good. This darkness suited our relationship.</p><br/><p>I wet my throat with the coffee in my paper cup as I looked in front of me.</p><br/><p>The traitor was looking around at the meeting room. His eyes were gently curved, making him look like he was smiling when he wasn\u2019t. A nice-looking nose and slightly curved lips. On top of that, he was nice, polite, and gentle.</p><br/><p>The summation of these things made Choi Gunyoung, someone anyone would like.</p><br/><p>What was his true face? I was now suspicious if his mask even had the function of being taken off. His actions and speech, which flowed naturally like water, if all this was calculated\u2026 Then he was truly an incredible person in every sense of the word.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really okay with continuing to work like this? Even though you\u2019ll be working under me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shot the first question.</p><br/><p>If he stubbornly kept his fa\u00e7ade going until the end, then I might be branded as the bad guy, but I would take the risk rather than continuing to have him by my side.</p><br/><p>The traitor smiled faintly as he replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I was thinking about changing teams. There has never been a time in my life when things went so badly for me. Before joining this team, I had a systematic plan prepared, but it was ruined. Because you were so good at your job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you suddenly change your mind? When you say that your plan was ruined because of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>From my intuition, I felt like he had a different reason than Neptune.</p><br/><p>The traitor stared at me as if examining me. My expression was probably stiffer than normal since my voice was the same.</p><br/><p>He abruptly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re happy about continuing to work with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you be uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, I\u2019ll endure it since you\u2019ll be more uncomfortable than me from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you impatient because you were happy that the guy who you were secretly wary of was going far away, but then he decided to stay? Still, you should control your expression. Your expression looks menacing.\u201d</p><br/><p>I needed two more seconds to completely comprehend the situation.</p><br/><p>When I blinked, the traitor smiled as though he was enjoying this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quick-witted. I knew way back that you were excessively wary of me. I wondered if it was because you were competitive or because you were wary of me due to our personalities being so different. But when I brought Simon Lee\u2019s song over and you hurriedly brought and pushed for Lee Taehee\u2019s song, I became certain. You can\u2019t stand me taking away the spotlight.\u201d</p><br/><p>At some point, the traitor\u2019s smile changed into one of mockery.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019ve been promoted, do you want to work with a junior who will listen to and revere you? But the more I thought about it, the more annoyed I became about leaving you rejoicing as though everything turned out well. I want to make you very uncomfortable. This is the time when you use your good reputation, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>I continued to listen since I didn\u2019t have the slightest thought of wanting to stop him.</p><br/><p>However, the traitor seemed to have interpreted my reaction for something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you surprised? The Choi Gunyoung you know isn\u2019t like this, right? This is me. I\u2019m only telling you, but I have never seen anyone as unpleasant and hateful as yo- Why are you smiling?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression stiffened slightly.</p><br/><p>Was I smiling? Ah, I was. At this rate, the tips of my lips would hang on my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m smiling because\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped answering and laughed loudly. I felt all ticklish inside that I couldn\u2019t endure it. I almost exploded in laughter. My laugh rang out noisily in the meeting room.</p><br/><p>For six months, he played the biggest role in making me a mental patient.</p><br/><p>Because of him, I was struggling with distrust of others. I also felt guilty because I thought I might have been too obsessive over the things I saw and heard in the future that I had branded someone who might not necessarily be a bad person as a traitor.</p><br/><p>Also, just now, I had thought that I might never see behind his mask.</p><br/><p>After barely managing to contain my laughter, I looked at the traitor. He was looking at me too. Perhaps it was because my reaction was so different from what he wanted, but his expression was utterly odd.</p><br/><p>I gulped down the rest of my cooled coffee and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why I\u2019m smiling is because I felt so refreshed. No, should I say reinvigorated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve finally washed my hair in six months, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Korean saying, roughly about how couples who only think to receive love from one another were enemies in a past life.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-100\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 100\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-102\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 102\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201315\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

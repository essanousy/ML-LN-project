The scene that would only remain in my memory was completely different from the scene in front of me right now. The commotion died down, and the scale of the accident had been glossed over as \u2018an unpleasant instance\u2019.</p><br/><p>The police took the drunk man who wasn\u2019t in his right mind away. The injured were treated at pharmacies or sent to the university hospital nearby. Since the majority of the injured people had been hit by the traffic cones or fallen over while fleeing, there was no need to call an ambulance.</p><br/><p>While the mood was a bit uneasy, this changed soon as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh damn, I was really freaking out. What kind of instance is this after going out in public?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, the \u2018Now, We\u2019 members are going to talk on stage because of it! I could only see them from afar because it was too crowded. Quick! Let\u2019s get seats at the front!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the news that the \u2018Now, We\u2019 team and their guests, including Neptune, were going on stage, people began gathering around the small stage. The jib camera that had been set up was moving in the air as it filmed this sight.</p><br/><p>I gave the USB drive containing the instrumentals to the audio staff and went to find Neptune when Producer Bae Junghwan approached me with quick steps. After fixing his hat twice, he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, about the current situation. Since the news is already spreading through social media, I think it\u2019ll be quite the hot topic if we issue a promotional press release. Is it okay for my team to freeload off of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I tilted my head, Producer Bae scratched his head and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking about how it would be if we packaged the scenes where we gathered the people\u2019s attention, who were originally at the scene of the incident, and where we go up on the stage to calm the mood. Like a moving tale during a recording. Though it is a bit too dynamic to call it a moving tale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be fine. If there\u2019s a problem with the press release on my side, then the PR team-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we gathered the people\u2019s attention by your request. I was wondering if it was okay for us to freeload off this when you settled the problem on your own\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m completely okay with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather, I had a ton to thank Producer Bae and the staff since they listened to my absurd words and readily agreed to my request asking if Neptune could perform a song.</p><br/><p>This incident would have been a bolt out of the blue for the filming team as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry that the recording has been delayed. You\u2019re even letting Neptune perform.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople\u2019s safety takes priority over delays. Since our members are going to go up and greet people on the stage as well, we were going to get some airtime from that anyways. You\u2019re obviously going to go up as well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, well, if I have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. Also-\u201d</p><br/><p>I was nodding when Producer Bae said something completely unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout the incident. I think it might be on the news later, is that okay? The newsroom asked me to ask for your understanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe news?\u201d</p><br/><p>That would go on the news? Not on internet articles or the entertainment show, but the news?</p><br/><p>It seemed my flustered expression was clearly revealed as Producer Bae stressed that it would quickly pass since it would be in a news brief and that I shouldn\u2019t be too troubled by it.</p><br/><p>I rigidly nodded my head. If it would quickly pass, then\u2026 there probably wouldn\u2019t be a problem. It wasn\u2019t like there were only one or two incidents on the news. Even cases where someone rescued a person who had fallen down onto the subway tracks or had captured a heinous criminal with his bare hands would quickly die down so this shouldn\u2019t matter much.</p><br/><p>Just then, my phone in my pocket rang. It was Team Leader Park.</p><br/><p>I answered the phone while separating from Producer Bae.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>-I know that you are in the middle of recording, but there are weird posts popping up on social media. I\u2019ve even been receiving an outpour of calls from reporters. So I felt like I had to ask you personally, are you in Sinchon?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes. I\u2019m in Sinchon. What kind of posts did you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>-\u2018Now, We\u2019 team and Neptune are filming in Sinchon, but a drunk driver suddenly charged down a street filled with people. Everyone was at a loss due to the shock, but Neptune\u2019s manager, which I think they are talking about you, dragged the driver out and ended the incident?</p><br/><p>Her voice was filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>-Also, I heard that \u2018the \u2018Now, We\u2019 team is going on stage to greet people because of the uneasy mood\u2019 and that \u2018people nearby should go and watch since Neptune is going to perform as well.\u2019 How much of this is the truth and how much is made up?</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. I think it\u2019s all true. From the beginning to the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if she didn\u2019t know what to say, Team Leader was silent for a moment before asked in a bewildered voice.</p><br/><p>-\u2026 Just what did you do during the entertainment show recording?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something newsworthy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as those words came out of my mouth, they felt surreal. I also suddenly thought that I should tell my parents and my brother ahead of time. While I didn\u2019t know if I would be in the news or not, there would be a huge fuss at home if they saw it without knowing.</p><br/><p>-My word, are you hurt?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Okay. Either way, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s all true? While I don\u2019t know how big this incident will become, I\u2019ll talk to the reporters so don\u2019t worry and focus on the recording. Let\u2019s talk after.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, I called my brother and my parents. I told them that I would explain in detail later about thirty times. Only then did I go find the girls. They were preparing for their performance in an event tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ready? I think they are done setting up the cameras, we\u2019ll going to go up soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said this while going in, the girls all turned to look at me. Their eyes were alarming.</p><br/><p>LJ clicked her tongue as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like experiencing dangerous things or seeking thrills? If you do, then tell me instead of going against a truck. I\u2019ll try to work something out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you seem too calm for someone who returned from the scene of an accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did she mean \u2018calm\u2019? I explained that my appearance wasn\u2019t everything, but Im Seoyoung rushed to me and slapped my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa! Oppa, you are seriously unbelievable! Why do you do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, a while ago, no, you were almost in an accident just now! We took deep breaths to calm our beating hearts, yet oppa is talking about the performance like nothing\u2026! You were almost in a car accident! A car accident!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her small palm hit my arm multiple times.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I know, but I suddenly thought it was an opportunity. Since they said this incident was spreading on social media and if you perform your title track here, it might become a huge topic if we\u2019re lucky\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The more I talked, the more chilly the atmosphere became. LJ was glaring at me, and Lee Taehee was blankly staring at me with her arms crossed. I didn\u2019t know what Lee Songha was doing as she had her back towards me and wasn\u2019t looking in my direction.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung stomped her feet hard. Then she tilted her head up and looked at me mercilessly. Her fierce eyes were wet with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn opportunity? If, if, if you were hurt, do you think we\u2019ll be happy if we used this opportunity to perform and gain popularity? Do-don\u2019t tell me\u2026 you were thinking this as you jumped in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how much I wanted to increase Neptune\u2019s popularity, would I really do something that crazy? I was firmly shaking my head and comforting them when Lee Taehee came up to us. Then she tapped Im Seoyoung\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop for now and get ready for the performance. Oppa\u2026 Either way, he created this opportunity by risking his life so we need to do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>While she looked calm compared to Im Seoyoung and LJ, her gaze was a bit chilly as she looked at me. After calming Im Seoyoung down, she stood in front of me. With a sigh, she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything dangerous from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaehee, it\u2019s you who should-\u201c</p><br/><p>Damn. I began confusing the future that didn\u2019t happen and the changed present. While clicking my tongue, I looked at Lee Taehee\u2019s arms. They were thin and so white that they looked pale. With those arms that looked like they would break if I gripped them too hard, she had pushed my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be careful too. Don\u2019t jump into an incident and avoid it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the ability to jump in. My athletic ability is garbage.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said while shrugging her shoulders.</p><br/><p>I suddenly became curious about what she thought when she did that. What was she thinking when she rushed in front of the truck and pushed my back? Well\u2026 Since it didn\u2019t happen, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hear an answer in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay, but talk with Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was worried because she kept her back turned towards me. When I came close, her state was a bit, no, very odd.</p><br/><p>She was holding her phone with her fingers that were so pale they were like a mannequin\u2019s. On the screen were the lyrics of their title track \u2018Satellite\u2019 that they were going to sing on the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy the lyrics all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t remember the lyrics.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said with a stiff face. Her black eyes trembled as though they had lost their way. For her to not remember the lyrics\u2026 She looked more scared than when she was in front of the truck, holding the baby, in the future I saw.</p><br/><p>I bent my knees and stared directly at her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you that surprised? It really wasn\u2019t much. You saw it too. I\u2019m not hurt anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could have been hurt really bad. You could have even died. In a place I couldn\u2019t see you, without me knowing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her white face almost looked blue. It seemed that her mind was filled with thoughts of me getting carried away in an ambulance as a bloody mess or with all my bones broken.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why would I die? It\u2019s not like I jumped in front of an oncoming truck or did some stunt in the air. All I did was open the door and dragged the driver out when the truck stopped. I value my life too so don\u2019t be so worried\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while smiling gently, but Lee Songha suddenly grabbed my arm.</p><br/><p>Her eyes, which were trembling like a stormy sea, gradually calmed down. Calmer than ever, her eyes stared directly at me for a long time. Only when my legs started to go numb did she say in a small voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She let go only after hearing my reply.</p><br/><p>At a sudden thought, I slowly looked around at Lee Songha and the other girls.</p><br/><p>If, in the future I saw, the truck didn\u2019t charge at Lee Songha and Lee Taehee and if that last moment wasn\u2019t embedded in my mind, then I might not have jumped into this incident this much.</p><br/><p>I realized that Neptune had become a significant part of my life.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppas, you\u2019re so cool! You look better than on TV!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah! Their looks are amazing in real life! How could they be so unbelievably pretty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t they just film here instead of going somewhere else?\u201d</p><br/><p>The power of celebrities was incredible.</p><br/><p>People were crowded around the stage, even so far back that it made you wonder if they could even see them. There were also a lot of people looking down from two or three-story buildings nearby. It seemed like the truck incident had already thrown back into a corner of their minds as everyone\u2019s face was filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Now, We\u2019 members skillfully heated the mood. Entertainment show veterans were on another level. Even in such a sudden situation, their back-and-forth was natural like flowing water.</p><br/><p>Neptune and even the child actors were waving their hands with a smile.</p><br/><p>It felt like I was the only one here who was stiff. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t show it.</p><br/><p>Of course, I had seen a lot of stages while going around with Neptune, and there were countless times when the number of spectators exceeded this. However, I was always below or behind the stage.</p><br/><p>It was my first time being on stage, sharing the attention.</p><br/><p>The gazes on me were very uncomfortable. There were even some people who murmured my name, but whenever I heard my name, it felt like another wrinkle appeared on my face. As expected, this wasn\u2019t my preference.</p><br/><p>While I was clicking my tongue, Hwang Jaehyun approached me, holding a mic.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, this is Neptune\u2019s manager, Mr. Jung Sunwoo. You were all surprised before, right? We were very surprised as well when we heard that the person who went off to the bathroom had caught a drunken driver on the scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughter erupted from below the stage. The people who had been looking at other celebrities were turning to look at me one after another. I greeted the people who waved their hands as they faced their phone cameras towards me when I saw a familiar face in the crowd.</p><br/><p>Kim Taejong. He was standing next to his girlfriend and looking at me with a stupid expression. He looked the same as in my memory. When I greeted him by gesturing with my eyes, he became surprised. Seeing this, I felt like my slightly stiff shoulders relax.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, say something to the crowd.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwang Jaehyung handed me the mic.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm. It\u2019s fortunate that not many people were hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>I added a few simple words after that before handing the mic back. After hearing people cheer in front of me, I felt like I was going deaf.</p><br/><p>Hwang Jaehyun spoke to the crowd again,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we can\u2019t just end it like this, Neptune here will perform a song. Please give them a lou\u2026 It seems you will. Ow, my ears. Then we\u2019ll start Neptune\u2019s special performance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Neptune\u2019s performance began, accompanied by a violin melody.</p><br/><p>The other celebrities and I came down from the stage and watched their performance like the other spectators. The scenes of the celebrities following the girls\u2019 choreography was clearly captured by the ENG and jib cameras.</p><br/><p>At first, the people\u2019s attention was divided into two. There were many people who were looking at the \u2018Now, We\u2019 team rather than Neptune\u2019s performance. However, a few seconds after the intro, their gazes were directed at the stage as though their eyes were dragged by the collar to look in that direction.</p><br/><p>I looked at each of the girls who were buried under the cheers.</p><br/><p>Their performance was perfect, which meant I was worried for nothing. Even Lee Songha, who I was the most worried about, looked completely fine on stage.</p><br/><p>It was an unfamiliar stage. It was an unexpected, sudden performance. Yet, this performance made those watching more excited than any of their other performances, even their music broadcast comeback performance which they had reduced their sleep to prepare for.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem I was the only one who felt this way as cheers loud enough to shake Sinchon rang out. During Lee Taehee\u2019s part, people slapped the backs of the person next to them and admired her, they went wild during LJ\u2019s rap, and they waved their hands friendlily at Im Seoyoung. They also crazily pressed their shutters at Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>At some point, voices popped up, telling them that one song wasn\u2019t enough and to perform another, asking for an encore, and even asking they hold a guerrilla concert right here. In fact, the celebrity members, including Hwang Jaehyun, sloppily followed the choreography as they sang the encore.</p><br/><p>I took a step back and captured this scene with my two eyes.</p><br/><p>Without me realizing, a satisfied smile hung on my lips.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-94\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 94\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-96\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 96\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201303\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

His face was still in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this guy your manager?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to call him that at least temporarily. He\u2019s the one who set up this meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung replied as she walked over to me. The Team 2 Leader snatched her arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeeting? What meeting?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Seo Byunghwe\u2019s new project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s faced reddened even more. I felt like I might get burnt if I touched him.</p><br/><p>I spectated whilst thinking these leisurely thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t going to do a project! You said you had no intention of doing another project even if someone clung to you and begged!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I was persuaded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung brushed the Team 2 Leader\u2019s hand off her and tapped my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe does a good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she smiled brightly. While her smile seemed to be at the epitome of innocence, but to me, it looked like her smile could ruin an entire country. However, regardless of what I thought inwardly, I made a similar smile.</p><br/><p>Since we decided to use each other, I needed to dance to her tune.</p><br/><p>It was easy to smile because there was something to smile at.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s entire body trembled. If me being with Seo Jijoon was stabbing him in the back, me being with Son Chaeyoung was hacking the back of his neck with an ax. His wooden neck was chopped off as it crashed to the ground.</p><br/><p>Then Son Chaeyoung continued to slowly saw at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s someone who does a good job, then that\u2019s who I\u2019ll work with. Isn\u2019t that right, team leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said casually before turning around.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in first. If there\u2019s any unsettled business, handle it amongst yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChaeyoung!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone might hear you, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>She grew distant without looking back. Chief Lee Bongjoon stuck to the wall to make way. Chief Jo, a nervous wreck, chased after her and tried to talk to her, but he didn\u2019t last more than a few steps. The Team 2 Leader returned to his senses once Son Chaeyoung\u2019s footsteps could no longer be heard.</p><br/><p>His unbridled anger poured down at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you still-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, tilting my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t I assigned to persuade Ms. Son Chaeyoung? I remember you saying good luck to me. Hmm, it seems to be going well.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cOr is it because of Mr. Jijoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Did you drag Jijoon to this meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drag him here. I asked him. Mr. Jijoon came because he owed me a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I didn\u2019t really need to ask Seo Jijoon. But I still decided to call him. It wasn\u2019t for the AA Studio employees, who were jumping up and down, or because I wanted to show off my friendship with Seo Jijoon.</p><br/><p>It was only because I wanted to see the Team 2 Leader make that face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you did say you found it unpleasant when I loitered around Mr. Jijoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt so wronged by being falsely accused of backstabbing that I felt I would only feel less wronged by doing this. I was expectant of what kind of face the Team 2 Leader would make when he heard I was in a meeting with Son Chaeyoung and Seo Jijoon.</p><br/><p>I thought that I would feel refreshed like drinking a cool soda.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was wrong. It felt much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about it, I was wondering why I needed to concern myself with all that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t plan to.\u201d</p><br/><p>I added in an almost whispering voice before smiling.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader glared angrily at me. My flesh tingled like it was being burnt. His gaze was more vicious than ever. To be honest, his gaze was pleasant. It was dangerous, but it gave me a thrilling feeling.</p><br/><p>Something similar to people who do extreme sports feel when standing on the edge of a cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that while sober?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sober. Rather, it looks like you\u2019ve had a drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, you\u2019re completely audacious. Just because you were able to persuade Chaeyoung\u2019s fickle mind, you think you can look down on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s face gave off a chill.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you can handle the aftermath?\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded like a threat that he would do everything in his power to screw me over from today onwards.</p><br/><p>Of course, I was prepared to do everything I could to screw him over as well.</p><br/><p>I smiled brightly as I asked back,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you, team leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cThen goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, team leader. Please take care of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The AA Studio CEO held my hand and bowed multiple times. Since the CEO was acting like this, his employees\u2019 heads bowed like a wave. My waist became sore from the amount of bowing I did.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will discuss it with Ms. Son Chaeyoung and contact you as fast as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned around after sending them off when the CEO grabbed my arm again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader! Team Leader Jung. Uh, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>He kept calling me by the position I hadn\u2019t yet gotten used to.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Seo Jijoon, I guess it\u2019ll be difficult to sign him too?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked like he was on the verge of asking me that question throughout the meeting. It seemed his desire overpowered his hesitation. Well, the CEO wasn\u2019t the only one. The writer and director looked at Seo Jijoon and Son Chaeyoung like they were seeing a masterpiece, and the UBS general manager\u2019s smile hung up to his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not managing Mr. Jijoon, but I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an actor who came to a meeting the day you asked, who could I ask if not you? As long as it can happen, we will try to agree to the signing fee and all conditions the actor may have if possible. Please. Please talk about the project in a positive light.\u201d</p><br/><p>I barely managed to send off the CEO, who tried to go for another two rounds. I had thought I had gotten used to dealing with persistent people from all the love calls Lee Songha receives, but this wasn\u2019t being persistent, it was begging.</p><br/><p>After sending the AA Studio employees off, I went back inside the restaurant. It was noisy at the front. Seo Jijoon was signing autographs for the restaurant employees. They probably saw a lot of celebrities because they were located in front of a broadcast company, but they glanced at his face and body as their faces flushed, regardless of what sex they were.</p><br/><p>As soon as I walked over, Chief Lee Bongjoon grabbed my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what? Hey, I knew you would clash with the team leader one day or another, but I never thought it would be a head-on collision like this. Do your guts get an upgrade when you become a team leader? You didn\u2019t even press the brakes when you collided.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon said, astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe team leader will be a pain if you get on his bad side. Your life might get messed up if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had already gotten on his bad side long ago. This is better than just testing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon even took pictures with the employees before coming over. When they broke out in sighs behind him, he waved at them. The employees couldn\u2019t approach and simply watched while stamping their feet from a distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cScary bastard. How can you give fan service at a time like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, fan service is like speed dial. It just comes on as soon as I press it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon put his arm around Chief Lee Bongjoon\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do I poke for it to come on? Let me have some service too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon poked Seo Jijoon\u2019s side and arm. Seo Jijoon laughed. He had kept a smile on when he suddenly met the Team 2 Leader before too.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for coming out today. It was a sudden request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d pay it off with my body. You can use me whenever you need me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon said while his eyes curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering when you would let me repay you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at Seo Jijoon. I wiped my lips twice before asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we go have another drink? We can talk too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon readily nodded his head. He headed over with Chief Lee Bongjoon while scratching his stomach.</p><br/><p>The now near empty private room was quiet. Son Chaeyoung sat alone at the empty table while reading the proposal. She looked over as though she had been waiting for the door to open yet frowned as soon as she saw Seo Jijoon.</p><br/><p>A strange mood hung in the room. I entered and closed the door behind me.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>A chief ran up the stairs like he was fleeing from something.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs a ghost chasing you from below?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chiefs who were on their way down turned around. To the Team 2 employees, who had suffered thanks to her, Son Chaeyoung wasn\u2019t a ghost but a disaster. One where an emergency alert had to be raised when she appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is she here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid she come to see the team leader? Since the CEO has already arrived, she might be here to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think she came to see them? Probably came to stir up a storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few Team 2 chiefs and road managers gathered at the fourth-floor lounge like they were seeking refuge. If they loitered around Son Chaeyoung, they would become perfect targets for Son Chaeyoung. Whether that her flipping out at them unexpectedly or being unfortunate enough to be assigned to manage her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Did something happen in Team 2?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader yawned as he walked out of his office. He was with Kim Hyunjo and Lee Kwanwoo.</p><br/><p>One of the refugees replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we just heard that Son Chaeyoung was downstairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd here I thought something happened. How can you not manage a single actor that you have to hide in a group? Is she the plague?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader chuckled as he inserted coins in the vending machine. His chuckles rubbed the Team 2 chiefs the wrong way. Once the Team 3 Leader bought coffee and went back to his office, the Team 2 chiefs expressed their dissatisfaction at Kim Hyunjo and Lee Kwanwoo, who remained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems the Team 3 Leader has forgotten because there hadn\u2019t been any progress but isn\u2019t Jung Sunwoo the one who should be managing Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief with the most experience ridiculed,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what he\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jealousy, envy, and dislike flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>With him as the start, the others began to join in.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he just counting the days after giving up? He can\u2019t give a favorable impression if he quits immediately after telling the CEO he could do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew that. Rather than a favorable impression, I heard he annoyed Son Chaeyoung even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many outside our company who think that Jung Sunwoo is Son Chaeyoung\u2019s new chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Lee Janghyun is setting up her schedule. Jung Sunwoo\u2019s just taking all the credit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone mumbled that they wished Son Chaeyoung stirred up a storm over there. It was mixed with malicious expectations. Others commented on how he would probably grab the CEO\u2019s legs and beg to quit after experiencing that.</p><br/><p>Although they were whispering to each other, it wasn\u2019t so quiet that Kim Hyunjo and Lee Kwanwoo couldn\u2019t hear them. Kim Hyunjo frowned deeply. Even Lee Kwanwoo, who had an innocent appearance with his slightly drooping eyes, creased his brows.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo uncrossed his arms and approached the Team 2 chiefs.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you watch what you say? He\u2019s a team leader now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, he needs to act like one to be one.\u201d</p><br/><p>An experienced chief grumbled when the elevator opened. The people who looked over out of habit became shocked like they were hit by a bolt out of the blue. It was the human disaster they had tried to avoid, Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>Why did she come to the fourth floor instead of the Team 2 Leader or the CEO\u2019s office? Did she come to the lounge to rest? Did they come to the wrong refugee shelter? The Team 2 chiefs and road managers hastily exchanged quiet glances.</p><br/><p>However, it was for naught. Son Chaeyoung wasn\u2019t interested in them. Holding a short box in her arms, she took a look around the office. Then she walked over to Kim Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Who? Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else would I be here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said indifferently. Lee Kwanwoo quickly made a call when Kim Hyunjo gave him a look. Son Chaeyoung sat alone at a table in the lounge until Jung Sunwoo, who had been sleeping in the sleeping quarters, arrived.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and Lee Kwanwoo were sitting in the table next to her with dazed expressions. Even the Team 3 Leader had come out of his office.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 chiefs, who had been about to quietly leave, sat their butts back down. Their gazes alternated between Son Chaeyoung and the elevator doors. They looked like they couldn\u2019t wait to see what they would talk about, no, what would happen once they met.</p><br/><p>A few quickly took out their phones and told their colleagues the news. Their phones vibrated continuously with replies.</p><br/><p>Soon, the number displayed on the elevators\u2019 display panel stopped at four.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo got off while brushing his ruffled hair. He looked around with still drowsy eyes before going over to Son Chaeyoung. He then sat down in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come so early? We still have some time before the meeting with the CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going in there. You just go in and talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to the meeting, why did you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to give you something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their conversation with extremely normal. However, it wasn\u2019t to the people spectating. It was stranger because it was normal. The sight in front of them was more surreal than one where scripts and swears were hurled.</p><br/><p>The people\u2019s eyes concentrated as they tried to find the hidden trap.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung pushed the boxes placed on the table over to Jung Sunwoo. Jung Sunwoo opened the box with an odd look. At the same time, the others discovered something even weirder than a trap. Inside the box was an assortment of donuts, covered in chocolate and syrup.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo asked as he stared down at the box.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bought one because I thought of you. For you to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came to give me this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He observed her with a gaze that read, \u2018Are you high?\u2019</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung smiled brightly as she replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the type to takes care of my people.\u201d</p><br/><p>A silent tsunami swept the lounge. It seemed someone had dropped their coffee as sounds of water splattering on the floor could be heard. While the Team 2 chiefs sat there at a loss for words, their phones continuously vibrated.</p><br/><p>Requests for what was going on, what kind of storm Son Chaeyoung was stirring, and even for live details poured in.</p><br/><p>Soon, the dazed Team 2 chiefs went back to the second floor with stunned expressions.</p><br/><p>With a donut in one hand.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo succeeded in persuading Son Chaeyoung. Son Chaeyoung brought over donuts. And the phrase \u2018my people\u2019 came out of Son Chaeyoung\u2019s mouth. The rumors spread like wildfire to the basement and even up to the CEO\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>This issue set the company in an uproar.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>As soon as Son Chaeyoung made her decision, everything proceeded rapidly.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, we had multiple meetings with AA Studio, and UBS. Although we hadn\u2019t yet signed, UBS released an articled about how Son Chaeyoung was positively examining a UBS drama for her return.</p><br/><p>However, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s article didn\u2019t garner as much attention as they anticipated. It would be the same even if it wasn\u2019t Son Chaeyoung. At some point, social media, online communities, and entertainment reporters shifted their attention to one place.</p><br/><p>The newly released Love Again.</p><br/><p>And the new actor, Song Inho.</p><br/><p>A wave that no one anticipated surged.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-190\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 190\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-192\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 192\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201496\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

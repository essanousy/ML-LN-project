The jib camera was rolling in the air, and a cart carrying a camera rushed down the rails. And Lee Songha, she stood on top of the a/c unit hanging outside the apartment.</p><br/><p>Her waist and thighs were supported by wires.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she about to climb up the building?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter blankly mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t a stunt person take her place after she just acts as if she will?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr will they just take closeup shots now and film the rest on another set?\u201d</p><br/><p>While the Weekly Entertainment staff were discussing, Lee Songha bent her knees. Then she kicked off the a/c unit and jumped up. They gulped. At the same time, her small hands gripped the rusty banister on the second floor. She then began to steadily climb the building.</p><br/><p>To a higher banister, to a higher a/c unit.</p><br/><p>Extras, dressed up as zombies, flailed their hands through each window. Lee Songha narrowly avoided and slowly yet surely made her way up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why they set it up so that she wanted to be a gymnast. To film scenes like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even seem like she\u2019s being pulled up by the wires either. She really is climbing her way up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think she wore underneath her skirt?\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer smacked the back of the production assistant\u2019s head repeatedly.</p><br/><p>The reporter admired the scene as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it seem like she really learned gymnastics? Like look at her actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe did learn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A staff member who wore his baseball cap backwards suddenly joined in.</p><br/><p>He was the staff member Chief Jung Sunwoo asked to comment on Lee Songha. The Weekly Entertainment staff quickly picked up their camera and handed him a wireless mic. The staff coughed and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe worked hard to learn it because she wanted to do her own stunts. She went to a gymnastics coach to learn too. And parkour and climbing? The one where you climb inside a building. Apparently, she learned those too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile alternating between filming her drama on top of that. I heard she went back and forth between China and Korea during weekends. I saw her schedule, and it was incredible. Chief Jung, who balanced that schedule, is hardcore, and Lee Songha, who actually handled it all, is even more incredib-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, oh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The production assistant leaped up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member hastily turned around. Lee Songha lost her grip on an a/c unit while trying to avoid a zombie\u2019s hand. Her slender body crashed onto the banister below. Then she powerlessly fell into the veranda.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an act.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, the staff member laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee how the camera is still following her movements? It\u2019s all an act.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weekly Entertainment staff quickly looked around. The jib camera was hovering over the veranda Lee Songha fell in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe action looks incredibly real, right? We were all surprised during the rehearsal. We thought she would be seriously injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>The amazed staff gestured to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He led them to monitors Director Choi Sungwon and other cast members were gathered in front of. The Weekly Entertainment crew cautiously and quietly stood behind them. The staff member whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see the monitor showing the one-shot, right? Look at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their gazes focused on it.</p><br/><p>The scene of Lee Songha getting back up and climbing again was clearly reflected on the screen. At first, it looked like she was barely making her way up, but her actions soon looked visibly lighter. There was no hesitation in her steps.</p><br/><p>Staring at the screen, the camera director blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trembling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s shoulders, arms, and even her fingers were trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Is that also her acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s half-and-half. Even if there are wires and mats, how scary do you think it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer chin is trembling too. Is she crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>They stopped speaking at some point.</p><br/><p>The camera, which tilted up from her trembling shoulders, captured her face. She wasn\u2019t crying. Lee Songha was smiling. A face messily mixed with fear and euphoria.</p><br/><p>As though she couldn\u2019t contain how happy she was climbing up a wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon had a pleased smile as his gaze focused on the screen.</p><br/><p>Even the other actors behind him cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god. Look at her expression. How can she express the feeling of being suppressed finally breaking free so well? It\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid she experience a lot even though she\u2019s young? Unless she has family issues like Lee Yeonwoo, there\u2019s no way she can express that feeling so clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she do an interview with a smile just now? How can she get into her role so quickly? Does she have a switch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I tell you something more amazing? Before we started filming, she was mumbling something with a serious face. I thought she was memorizing her lines, but it turns out she was mumbling how she wants to eat ice cream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that girl makes this veteran anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even veteran actors commented.</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon shouted, \u201cCut!\u201d in satisfaction and said to the actors,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were all great too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no good if we are similar, director.\u201d</p><br/><p>The actress Park Saeryung grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m being paid much more than her so I need to be much better than her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, my one-shot before, could we refilm it? I want to try saying my line a bit more quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kihwan said while scratching his chin.</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s eyes curved into crescent moons.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you can. If an actor is dissatisfied with his scene and wants to redo it, of course, he can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at her. She\u2019s so happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Saeryung mumbled with a dispirited look. Lee Songha was smiling happily as she dangled from the wires on the fourth floor while waving at Chief Jung Sunwoo, who was looking up from below.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Park Saeryung suddenly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, the second villain appearing on scene 24. You said he was also Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s actor, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The actors\u2019 gazes gathered on Director Choi Sungwon.</p><br/><p>Even the Weekly Entertainment crew perked their ears at this new information.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he also like her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t been able to confirm myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon said as he looked at Jung Sunwoo in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish he was.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A zombie disaster blockbuster? I can already smell its failure. Just don\u2019t attempt to screen it in the States or it\u2019ll be an embarrassment for the entire country. Watching American dramas would be much better than pay 10,000 won on this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p><br/><p>His frowns deepening, SBE Film CEO waved his hand.</p><br/><p>The other employees attending the meeting looked gloomy as well. The PR Team employee shook her analysis as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe expected this sort of reaction considering the genre.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did expect it, but it still hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are other reactions. My analysis resulted in very polarizing opinions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The PR Team employee began reading again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the trustworthy Director Choi Sungwon and a slew of trustworthy actors on board, it could be incredible. I heard that the budget was over 30 billion won, I can\u2019t wait. Such a large-scale movie, I bet more than ten million people will go watch for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO waved his hand even more intensely than before. The other employees looked so gloomy that clouds seem to form above their heads. The newest employee of the Planning Team, who was sitting at the end of the room, whispered to the employee sitting next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with this mood? Isn\u2019t it good if there are good reactions? They said that they couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s scarier.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Planning Team employee replied with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the audience is expecting a perfect movie, we\u2019ve only broken even if we deliver a perfect movie. It ends up becoming an okay movie. If we want to satisfy an audience like that, we need to give them a movie beyond perfect, and that\u2019s not easy. Also, if the movie quality is lower than perfect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee trailed his words. The eyes of those who heard him became hollow.</p><br/><p>The CEO slapped the table and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not worry about it right now! We just need to make it a success! In\u2026 In the worst-case scenario, we will still break even. Marketing is going smoothly, and we have Director Choi Sungwon and a great cast, how could it flo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His speech, which started confidently, slowly crumbled and finally crushed completely.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What do we do if it flops?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. All the scenarios we are prepping will be put on a halt.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO laughed dispiritedly at the project producer\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Just then, the project producer slowly raised his hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO, I\u2019m sorry to tell you this at this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sorry, don\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe budget\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring up the budget! Don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe director said he needed a bit more. Just a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>People groaned when they heard this.</p><br/><p>The CEO\u2019s hands shook as he shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the budget enough?! We\u2019ve poured all the money in it, yet how could it not be enough?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of the computer graphics. Apparently, they need to hire more people for the visual effects team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe brought over our team working in China! Are they not enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost half the scenes require CG. The current team has already been separated to fill positions, but we still don\u2019t have enough. What should we do? Should I tell him that we don\u2019t even have enough even if he kills us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! You-!\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO barely managed to take deep breaths after his outburst.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Tell him that we got it. And don\u2019t let the fact that we talk about this slip on set! The director and cast must be feeling a ton of pressure, we can\u2019t add to that and have it influence the project!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer immediately replied. The glaring CEO said in a hoarse voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s set visit with investors and foreign sales agents, the preparations are perfect, right? That\u2019s our only avenue for more money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s scene will be a full shot of the cast. Since it\u2019s a large-scale, dynamic scene, it should be worth spectating. They brought on almost a hundred extras dressed up as zombies as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scale is obviously large considering how much money we\u2019re pouring into it. They already know who\u2019s starring in the movie as well. I wish there was something that could entrance those fellows.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO rubbed his temples as he mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have that extra factor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cJoyoon! Nam Joyoon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon, who had just changed into his movie outfit, turned his head.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup, the actor who pressed his baseball cap down on his head, gestured to him. The actors and staff who worked on the independent film were gathered around him looking at a phone. Nam Joyoon picked up his bag and went over there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeekly Entertainment is showing what they filmed on set.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon looked at the screen. At the top was the subtitle {International Star, Lee Songha, and the set of the hot topic, \u2018Alive\u2019}. They just finished showing an exclusive interview with Lee Songha and they showed sketches of the set.</p><br/><p>The independent film cast and crew sighed at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scale is amazing. The size of the blue screen is as big as a building.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means they are going to paste the entire background with CG. Oh damn, look at those zombies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat looks like fun. Even if it\u2019s tough, working on a set like that must be worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will I get to star in a film with those actors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust think they live in a different world than us. It\u2019s only painful for you if you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a different world?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere could be a day when we work on a set like that! No one knows the future. Even Mr. Nam Joyoon here is appearing on that film! Didn\u2019t you say tomorrow would be your first scene? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said while placing his hand on Nam Joyoon\u2019s shoulder. The staff and actors\u2019 congratulatory, jealous, and even unpleasant gazes focused on him.</p><br/><p>Just then, an interview of a crew member began to play.</p><br/><p>-She worked hard to do her own stunts. She went to a gymnastics coach to learn, even parkour and climbing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShe really prepared a ton. But Mr. Joyoon, do you not have to prepare for anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone asked.</p><br/><p>The independent film director licked his lips and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really great that you keep coming on time for shoots, but I\u2019m a bit worried as well. This could be the opportunity that changes your life. It\u2019s not enough to focus on that film completely, yet your time is being taken up by us-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe his role doesn\u2019t need to prepare for anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>A piercing voice shot out from amongst the actors.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunghyun. Why are you like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? If he doesn\u2019t have a big role, then he doesn\u2019t have much to prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sunghyun shrugged before leaving. A few actors glanced at Nam Joyoon before following after Lee Sunghyun.</p><br/><p>The heated mood cooled. The remaining people examined Nam Joyoon\u2019s expression, but there wasn\u2019t any change. Nam Joyoon continued to watch the screen.</p><br/><p>The assistant director patted Nam Joyoon\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him. And you said you\u2019re playing a supporting role? Then it\u2019s a success!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Just think of it as learning from the big boys. Be directed by the famous Director Choi Sungwon. There must be a ton of top stars there so have a look around. But, can you get me Park Saeryung\u2019s autograph?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Kihwan for me! I\u2019m a huge fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s okay, Lee Songha for me! My daughter sings their songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>The set quickly became noisy again.</p><br/><p>After taking a sip from a water bottle, Nam Joyoon took out his phone. It vibrated, indicating he received a text. After checking its content, he sent his usual reply.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup tilted his head behind him and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is it Chief Jung Sunwoo again? What is he saying this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat he\u2019ll come pick me up tomorrow before the shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said, laughing silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat young man\u2019s really genuine. At first, I thought he would stop after a couple of visits, but he\u2019s been helping you out for the past few months. Seeing as he cares about you even though he has an international star like Lee Songha, he must\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Been your mom in your past life. This is parental love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, you know, I\u2019m a bit worried since you\u2019re acting like normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup said while scratching his neck,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really preparing for your shoot properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Although summer had fully arrived, the morning wind was still a bit chilly. A young man wearing varsity jacket ran into a gym.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think a celebrity lives near here! I saw that person outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, that manager\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah! That person! How did you guess right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>A few people inside the gym laughed simultaneously. A muscular employee swept a mop along the floor as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHis actor works out in our gym. He\u2019s close with our manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe came by frequently for the past two months. You must have missed him because you\u2019re new.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. An actor. I want to see him. When does he usually come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe comes at night when he has a shoot and comes whether it\u2019s day or night on days he\u2019s free so you should see him soon? Get me a towel from the cabinet behind you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The university student approached a tall cabinet. When he opened the door, he was met with two chilling objects.</p><br/><p>They were someone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah! Fuck! What the hell?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The university shouted as he backed away. He even tripped over his feet and fell on his butt. The people who had been flashing glances his way fell back laughing.</p><br/><p>The student pointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-who is this person?! And what is he doing in there?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee laughed so hard that he began coughing.</p><br/><p>The shocked student quickly looked back at the cabinet.</p><br/><p>The man who had been standing straight in the cabinet walked out. Although the student didn\u2019t know how long he was in there for, his steps were wobbly. His eyes, which formed a frown as though they weren\u2019t used to the light, still shined in a cold light.</p><br/><p>The student\u2019s shoulders trembled without knowing as he slowly approached the employee.</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah. That man, what was he doing inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t do anything. He just stands in there all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently he needs to do it for his acting? There are times he\u2019s in there overnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The student paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he crazy? It looks like he might be mentally ill. No, his eyes weren\u2019t normal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee shrugged. Just then, the gym door opened, and Jung Sunwoo entered. He lightly greeted the people there and walked over to the man leaning against the cabinet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, were you in there again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust for a bit. A few minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to stop doing this. There are other ways so there\u2019s no need to keep doing something so dange-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man smiled faintly at Jung Sunwoo, who clicked his tongue in worry, and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I can play my role properly now.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-136\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 136\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-138\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 138\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201386\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

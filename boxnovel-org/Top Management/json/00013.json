Netizens these days are quick-witted and are able to tell if an article was sponsored by their agency or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to make sure we\u2019re not too aggressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it Star Trend? Not long ago, I couldn\u2019t read their one of their articles since it was plastered with words like successful debut, strong impression and rising star.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will make sure to tell them to refrain from doing that. We all know they flopped so it would have been embarrassing\u2026 The reporter\u2019s intern probably wrote it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to the conversation, I started to connect the relationship between the management team, PR team and reporters.</p><br/><p>A manager would hand over article-worthy materials to the PR team and the PR team would send it out or give it to a close reporter to release a more sincerely written article.</p><br/><p>If the celebrity had enough following, that article would be copied exactly by other mass media outlets, in other words, Urakkai articles<sup>[1]</sup>. If not, it would be buried without any replies.</p><br/><p>Just like Neptune\u2019s articles that could only be found by searching through a search engine.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Chief. The afternoon interview we have scheduled today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe G-Today one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s best we tell them not to say, \u2018it must have been hard\u2019, \u2018you guys have endured a lot,\u2019 excessively. We might get reactions like, \u2018Just how hard could being a celebrity be?\u2019 and \u2018Who in the world hasn\u2019t endured a lot.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I guess we\u2019ll just have to say that we\u2019ll try our best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably the best. Since they are going in as a replacement, if they even look a bit bad, then they will probably get criticized.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s wait for the reactions of the first broadcast before moving forward\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know when, but the meeting was proceeding more and more like a meeting. Even the male-female pair were tapping on their laptops. They were writing something on Word.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t feel right just sitting there so I took out a new notebook and jotted down the words coming out of Team Leader Park and Hyunjo\u2019s mouths.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think about asking Blackout to mention them on their Instagram account? If the article headline contained both Blackout and Neptune, I think it will have quite the media following.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait on that. When we showed them off last time as Blackout\u2019s younger sister group, the reactions weren\u2019t very good. If something goes wrong, Neptune, who are just starting to get attention, might be branded as unlikeable. Blackout fans are so intense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we do that, the company will even receive complaints.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Hundred percent right. Hundred percent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park who was scratching her head suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Chief. The Neptune girls have no personal problems, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there is anything that can\u2019t be revealed to the reporters, we have to know first. What could have been stopped with a short-handled hoe will grow to something that can\u2019t be stopped with a shovel<sup>[2]</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one with a boyfriend? The rapper from Punchline seems to have taken a liking to Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the guy, are you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just telling you what I heard from their stylist. You have to say I\u2019m almost sure. Punchline will appear together with Neptune on Next K-Star. Since they already have a fanbase, it\u2019ll be bad if there\u2019s a scandal. We really can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that already. I\u2019ll keep a careful watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of you should watch them with care as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park advised as she looked at Gunyoung and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a suspicious situation arises, we\u2019ll tell you immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I noted down some suspicious situations and underlined the words, \u2018The guy who raps in Punchline\u2019, a few times. If a nationwide emotional scandal pops up, the female side is usually the one to get harmed. Although it had only been a day since I had met Neptune and Songha, they were the still the first celebrities I was assigned to. It was obvious I wasn\u2019t going to look at the guy who raps in Punchline favorably.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rattle.</p><br/><p>As the door opened, a man I had never seen before popped his head in. He had the friendly impression of a hyung next door.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, I\u2019m sorry to bother you while you\u2019re busy. I just had an urgent favor to ask Team Leader Park.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Chaeyoung is going to a preview tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chaeyoung? Did he mean Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>Although she was only in her mid-twenties, she was an actress who started out as a child actress and has more than ten years of acting experience under her belt. Although she didn\u2019t have the fame of Sung Dowon, she was still someone whose name would always appear on the headlines of top articles. Even her filmography was robust.</p><br/><p>I went to see a movie that cast Son Chaeyoung as an innocent university student three times.</p><br/><p>Was this person Chaeyoung\u2019s manager?</p><br/><p>The person who saved a nation in his past life wasn\u2019t me, but this person.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to wear a Balmain one-piece dress and she\u2019s asking if you could write an article that says she wore it better than a model.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about that combat uniform-like one-piece dress? Is she going to wear that? Chief Jo, you should have stopped her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there isn\u2019t much time left until her contract renewal, could you please release an article. Team Leader Park has a lot of reporters she has close ties with. Please save me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park sighed at Chief Jo\u2019s exaggerations.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem to release an article, but that dress really doesn\u2019t suit her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll hear lots of insults like \u2018her stylist is her anti-fan\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019s her agency doing\u2019 again.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the PR employees were mumbling, Chief Jo kept exaggerating his hardship while pleading.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, by the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who was about to leave turned back around.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you two new?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gunyoung and I who were waiting for the right time to greet him both got up at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I am Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Choi Gunyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It seems like they change whenever I am about to familiarize with them. Since you guys have good appearances, it looks like you\u2019ll have some stamina. If you start on this team, you\u2019ll adapt quickly to wherever you go next. Let\u2019s talk longer when we have a company get-together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I under\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slam!</p><br/><p>We stared at the door for a moment, but it didn\u2019t open again.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, the meeting went on for another hour. During that hour, I filled two pages with notes and admired Team Leader Park and her employees. Even though I had only met them a little while ago, I felt friendly with them like I had worked with them for a few months.</p><br/><p>Incredible people\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo tossed the van keys at Gunyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have continuous meetings lined up today. So you guys need to prepare for the G-Today\u2019s interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGunyoung, you must have done it before. I\u2019ve already called Taehee, so go take the girls to the shop, their stylists will be on their way as well. After putting on their outfits, they just need to go to the newspaper company. A reporter will guide you once you arrive. I\u2019ll get there before the interview starts.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said while staring at his notebook. In the schedule section, his schedule was densely packed with things he had to do today.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe girls\u2019 residence and shop address are already on the GPS so you just need to follow that and I\u2019ll send you the stylists\u2019 phone numbers, company address and the reporter\u2019s contact information via text message. Eat lunch at the shop like yesterday. Since the interview is at 2, be there by 1:30 at the latest. If there are any problems, call me. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, at night, we have a preliminary meeting/ dinner with the staff of Next K-Star. It\u2019ll probably take a while. I already told the girls, so just letting you guys know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor and I hurriedly packed our bags and went on the elevator.</p><br/><p>Getting off work today was off the table again.</p><br/><p>I sent a Kakao message<sup>[3]</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s 9:30 already\u2026 If we want to get there by 1:30 we don\u2019t have any time to waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does this place progress so fast on so little time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Next K-Star starts, we might even have to start living at the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the chief already lives here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He said he slept at the company yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to talk like there was nothing wrong.</p><br/><p>I understood why mind readers in movies and dramas were portrayed as cynical and warped characters. I was already uncomfortable knowing one person who was different on the outside from the inside, imagine how horrible it would be to see what was on everyone\u2019s minds.</p><br/><p>How fortunate I was for not having a mind-reading ability.</p><br/><p>I shook my head as I inwardly sent my support to a mind-reader I didn\u2019t know existed.</p><br/><p>Soon, the elevator arrived at the basement. The van was where we parked it yesterday. We stopped in front of the driver\u2019s seat. There were two people, but only one could be the driver.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou good at driving?\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor asked first.</p><br/><p>I got my license as soon as I graduated high school. After that, I only used my brother\u2019s car a few times. Although I received some training prior to this job, I was honestly a bit scared of driving in the complicated streets of Cheongdam-dong.</p><br/><p>As I cleared my throat, the traitor opened the door of the driver\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll make up for it by shuttling our lunches.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t decline and got on the passenger\u2019s seat. As soon as we operated the GPS, the van started to move smoothly.</p><br/><p>The traitor was even good at driving. Well, he did say he drove when he was working part-time for Blackout.</p><br/><p>On our way to their residence, I searched Sung Dowon on the internet. During the meeting, my concentration almost broke a few times because of sudden thoughts of Dowon. Now, I could leisurely search to my heart\u2019s content.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see\u2026 Sung Dowon\u2019s recent condition, rumors on his new movie, groundless tabloids. I thoroughly went through information related to Sung Dowon. There weren\u2019t a lot of negative public opinions.</p><br/><p>There was a recent article about Dowon\u2019s worth. $60, 000 per episode of nationwide dramas and in China, he received somewhere of $100, 000 per episode.</p><br/><p>With articles like these, there would usually be some disruptions in public opinion, however, the majority reaction was that he deserved it. He really was an actor with a very good public image.</p><br/><p>Handsome, good acting skills, a lot of charity work and had never caused any controversy in an interview or on social media. There wasn\u2019t even a single wrinkle.</p><br/><p>Just what happened to an actor like him? Just how big was the incident that Sung Dowon himself would say that his life as an actor could have been over? And what did he mean by he almost fell for their trap? And who were \u2018they\u2019?</p><br/><p>And why was the future I saw earlier different from the past?</p><br/><p>Ah damn\u2026 I so curious I could die!</p><br/><p><sup>[1]</sup> \uc6b0\ub77c\uae4c\uc774 (Urakkai) articles are just copy-pasted articles with just slight deviations from the original.

Star Search.</p><br/><p>It was an unfamiliar name. Though I had met, directly and indirectly, with hundreds of reporters during my work, and though there were dozens of names saved under the \u2018Reporter\u2019 category on my phone, I had never heard of a publication called Star Search.</p><br/><p>A scandal involving a top actor like Yoon Taekyung or Park Dojin, and it wasn\u2019t something cute like a dating scandal but a big deal like a drug scandal. For a small-scale, unknown publication to publish a huge scandal like that?</p><br/><p>Just in case, I indirectly asked Team Leader Park and Reporter Park Woojeong if there were any rumors about Yoon Taekyung or Park Dojin, but there weren\u2019t any that would deal a blow to their image. There was nothing about drugs either.</p><br/><p>That meant that Star Search exclusively collected and published this scandal.</p><br/><p>I suppressed my questions and first searched Star Search on a portal site. I should at least know their address before taking any measures. There could be an article about me being crazy if I just blindly entered their office and interrogated them.</p><br/><p>I needed to think hard if I wanted to come with a decent plan, but thinking furiously was enjoyable compared to when I was gloomy with no straws to grasp at.</p><br/><p>But something was weird.</p><br/><p>No matter how much I searched, there wasn\u2019t a publication known as Star Search. It was the same when I searched through the portal news category. A publication known as Star Search wasn\u2019t even registered.</p><br/><p>Did I mishear the company name? No, that wasn\u2019t possible.</p><br/><p>Then why wasn\u2019t it there?</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, have you heard of a publication known as Star Search?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked Team Leader Park as soon as I arrived at work. Team Leader Park gave me a surprised looked.</p><br/><p>\u201cStar Search? What about that damn publication? Where did you hear about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her reaction assured me. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t a non-existent company.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about them from a reporter I know, but I couldn\u2019t find them when I searched online. There wasn\u2019t a single article from them on the portal site either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, they aren\u2019t on a national portal site. They are a publication specializing in paparazzi in Hong Kong.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? Where?</p><br/><p>\u201cHong Kong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Well, it is time for you to be concerned about overseas publications since Songha\u2019s getting more known in China, so be more careful from now on. That place is much more cutthroat than here. They publish articles that we can\u2019t here in fear of lawsuits without worry. Especially Hong Kong, it\u2019s worse than Hollywood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, wait. Let me think for a second.</p><br/><p>If Star Search was a publication in Hong Kong, how could I approach them? It wasn\u2019t like I could get on a plane to Hong Kong right now, and even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to communicate with them. There were tons of publications in the country, yet why did have to be one in Hong Kong?</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park frowned as she continued to speak,</p><br/><p>\u201cStar Search especially doesn\u2019t like Korean stars very much so they write a lot of scandals regarding them. Those leeches. Of course, the more vicious leeches are the tabloids in this country that sell information and pictures to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>My ears perked at her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cTabloids in our country sell information and pictures? Star Search isn\u2019t independently digging around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile many publications do that, since Star Search specializing in the paparazzi, they usually buy them. Most of the information regarding Korean stars in the country are sent from here. You see, there\u2019s a lowlife company that deals with Star Search.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>DM Media.</p><br/><p>When I searched up the name Team Leader Park gave me, a registered publication popped up.</p><br/><p>On their homepage, which had multiple adult ads, there wasn\u2019t even the common interview article. All they had were entertainment spamming articles, revealing celebrity photos, and provocative tabloid articles that only used initials.</p><br/><p>I looked around for a long time before I found their address. Deumcheon district. It wasn\u2019t that far.</p><br/><p>Before I left, I went to find Kim Hyunjo and told him,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I\u2019m going to have Kwanwoo handle today\u2019s schedule and go meet with a reporter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA reporter? What reporter all of a sudden? Are you doing an interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I heard that there was a bad news item. I wanted to check up on it since it seemed troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo\u2019s expression became sour.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s you were talking about, it feels uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s not certain, I\u2019ll talk to you about it after I confirm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stated ambiguously. The scale this time was too big for me to discuss it without taking any measures, especially since I wasn\u2019t certain which of the two caused the problem.</p><br/><p>Yoon Taekyung and Park Dojin were big shots whose contracts reached the billions of won, and Well-Made Production and Chinese investors were also entangled in this situation. In other words, if I said something wrong and a problem arose, it would be a very serious matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, go check it. Call Team Leader Park or me immediately if there\u2019s something to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I handed Lee Songha\u2019s afternoon schedule to the recruit and immediately drove my minivan to DM Media\u2019s address.</p><br/><p>Hoping there would be an answer there.</p><br/><p>Geumsan Building, Gasan Neighborhood, Geumcheon District. Unit 301.</p><br/><p>The address was correct, yet I couldn\u2019t even the company, let alone an answer.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a sign outside the building, and unit 301 on the information panels in the first-floor lobby and elevator was empty.</p><br/><p>It was the same when I arrived at the third floor. There was something that looked like an office, but there wasn\u2019t a sign and the door was firmly locked. I couldn\u2019t even tell if there was someone inside or not. There wasn\u2019t even a reaction when I knocked.</p><br/><p>Even when I called the phone number on their homepage, it would simply ring with no one answering. I tried sending an email to the email address, but even that was immediately returned. At this point, I wondered if this even was a properly functioning publication.</p><br/><p>So this was a paparazzi company.</p><br/><p>How could I casually meet DM Media reporters? I pondered after returning to my minivan and looking up at the third-floor window, which had its blinds down.</p><br/><p>Then I decided to change my method.</p><br/><p>I entered the building again. This time, I took off my sunglasses and revealed my face. I planned on using myself as bait so that they would come to me since I couldn\u2019t find them.</p><br/><p>I hoped that I looked appetizing to the paparazzi.</p><br/><p>First, I went to the coffee chain on the first floor and ordered a cup of coffee.</p><br/><p>The employees and the customers recognized me. I had fled last time, but this time, I sat at a table. Once I responded friendlily to a customer who acted familiar as he approached me, more people started conversations with me.</p><br/><p>Slowly, news began to spread throughout the building, to the point where people on other floors came down to see me. Things were going as planned. If I kept at it, DM Media should hear about it too since they were a paparazzi company.</p><br/><p>After brooding over coffee for an hour, I went to the second-floor oriental medical clinic.</p><br/><p>My shoulders ached so it was a good opportunity. I received acupuncture, cupping, and electrotherapy and saw black blood clots. That was how I spent two hours in the building. I hadn\u2019t even seen the shadow of a paparazzi yet.</p><br/><p>Just as I was thinking of another way to approach them, my phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Excuse me, is this perhaps Mr. Jung Sunwoo?</p><br/><p>It was an unfamiliar woman\u2019s voice. She sounded a bit flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>-You\u2019re the owner of the white minivan, correct? I\u2019m sorry. I hit your van slightly by accident while parking.</p><br/><p>Oho? Was it this?</p><br/><p>I left in the middle of my physiotherapy and immediately went down to the parking lot. A young woman who was partly crouched and examining the back of my minivan jolted up.</p><br/><p>She wore a short skirt that emphasized her curves, slightly transparent coffee-colored stockings, and high heels. She gave off a different feeling from the female reporters I had seen until now.</p><br/><p>She was suspicious.</p><br/><p>Why would she hit my minivan when the parking lot was so empty?</p><br/><p>On top of that, she was a beauty. In fact, this part was more suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do? This seems like a new minivan. I\u2019ll pay the repair costs. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if you properly fix it, then it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman brushed her hair behind her ear as she glanced at my face.</p><br/><p>After hesitating for a bit, she asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you perhaps that person? The chief who manages Neptune and appeared on \u2018Now, We\u2019 not too long ago? I think you look like him, and you have the same name. The one people call \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThough I wish the last part wasn\u2019t true, I am that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s expression brightened at my reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god! It\u2019s my first time seeing a famous person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her gaze was filled with excitement as she looked at me. My spine tingled because her gaze seemed like she was seeing a really famous person. The woman, who had been chattering about how she saw a bunch of clips of me on the internet and how this was so cool, soon asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, excuse me. If you have time, could I buy you a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for denting your minivan by accident and I\u2019m a fan of Ms. Lee Songha as well. I saw every episode of Cat Guardian Ghost. Could you tell me a bit about Ms. Lee Songha? I absolutely won\u2019t tell anyone about it. Please?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her begging voice was overflowing with charm. Out of all the people I knew, Im Seoyoung was the one who acted the most charmingly, yet even she wouldn\u2019t be able to compare to her if she was here.</p><br/><p>In a normal situation, a man would probably consider this as hitting jackpot, regardless of repair costs. They might even drink fish sauce readily. However, considering my situation, the more the woman clung to me, the more suspicious I became.</p><br/><p>I was almost certain at this point.</p><br/><p>Should I ask her bluntly now? Or should I dance to her tune?</p><br/><p>After thinking about which one would provide me with the most information, I decided to obtain what information I could get while drinking coffee.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t fathom how they would react if I took a blunt approach considering they were a sly company that blocked all forms of communication. On top of that, I might really have to go to Hong Kong if I failed here so I proceeded more cautiously.;</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s have a cup of coffee since you\u2019re Songha\u2019s fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, if she was an employee of the paparazzi company, then I should be thankful for taking the bait.</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s name was Jung Hyesung though I couldn\u2019t tell if she was using her real name or not. Either way, Jung Hyesung led me to a small coffee shop across from the building. It was a cozy place with almost no customers \u2013 perfect for conversing.</p><br/><p>The early topics of discussions were mostly trivial topics about our personal lives. I did my best to seem interested and humored her.</p><br/><p>Once the coffee cooled to an adequate degree, Jung Hyesung smiled purely as she asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw the article regarding Ms. Lee Songha\u2019s new project. I hope that they film and air it quickly. Has the male lead not been decided yet? Netizens were chatting up a storm, asking who it is, but I haven\u2019t seen any articles confirming anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they haven\u2019t decided yet. It\u2019ll be decided soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Who is it? Can\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes sparkled.</p><br/><p>A suspicion crossed my mind that she might be recording our conversation. She was also regularly checking her phone.</p><br/><p>I shrugged as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t carelessly tell people about it. There\u2019ll be a commotion if speculative articles pop up before someone is confirmed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone to tell this to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do the netizens think it\u2019ll be?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked instead of replying. Jung Hyesung paused for a moment before answering,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve mentioned all the Korean stars that are currently resting right now? \u2018Isn\u2019t it Yoon Taekyung?\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll be Sung Dowon.\u2019 \u2018I think it\u2019ll be Park Dojin\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She mentioned a few more names after that. However, unlike how she tried to read my expression when she spoke the first few names, the other names seemed to have been mentioned to fill out the selection.</p><br/><p>If DM Media handed information about drug abuse along with evidence to Star Search, then it meant they were chasing him for a while.</p><br/><p>It took a few months to get enough evidence for a love scandal so they shouldn\u2019t have been able to gather evidence so quickly on drug abuse, which must have been done much more secretly.</p><br/><p>Also, if they were still chasing around the actor in question, then they would undoubtedly know that he was in discussion to join Royal Family.</p><br/><p>I said with a smiling face,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s someone among the names you\u2019ve mentioned. The person we\u2019re thinking about casting as the male lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s a small problem so we\u2019re looking into it to see if it\u2019s okay to sign him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Hyesung flinched then quickly opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cA problem? What kind of problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t talk about it since it isn\u2019t a very good matter. It\u2019ll be a big problem if rumors spread when we aren\u2019t certain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s bad, then is it a harmful rumor or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Hyesung asked as if trying to glean any information from me.</p><br/><p>Brrr.</p><br/><p>Something vibrated. I thought it was my phone, but it was hers. After glancing at her phone screen, Jung Hyesung jolted from her seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s my senior from work. I\u2019ll be right back after talking to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Hyesung answered her phone as she went out to the vacant terrace. At the same time, my phone rang. The timing was truly strange. This person was a senior from work as well.</p><br/><p>I glanced through the glass window as I answered Kim Hyungjo\u2019s call.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Where are you right now? No, wherever you are, come to the company right now! Quickly!</p><br/><p>Just then, my eyes met Jung Hyesung\u2019s through the windows.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know why, but she was looking at me with a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? I\u2019m meeting some-\u201c</p><br/><p>-Don\u2019t think about talking to a reporter and come back immediately! You\u2019re going to be in a bind if you talk to a reporter right now.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said while clicking his tongue.</p><br/><p>-I think the uneasy news item you mentioned is this, but some crazy journalist trash published a scandal about Lee Songha!</p><br/><p>\u2026What? A scandal?</p><br/><p>What sort of nonsense was this? Why a scandal all of a sudden? Did some crazy reporter try to pass off a fictional story as an article?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the other person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was there to be in a scandal with Lee Songha?</p><br/><p>-You! It\u2019s you!</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I said it\u2019s you!</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-113\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 113\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-115\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 115\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201341\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}
